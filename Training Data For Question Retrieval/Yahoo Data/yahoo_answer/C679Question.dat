There's this guy I have developed a crush on and now whenever i see him I start blushing and I get really quiet and when he comes and talks to me I'm red as a beet and can barely talk.

20090306220310AACPLoz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I have seriously relationship issues? Your opinion?	I'm just gonna call the guy Brad**   So Brad and I had a "thing", as in we both liked each other. Then for some reason he randomly broke it off, and i was so crushed. I told my self so many times that Brad didn't matter and that it was just never going to happen. Then he calls me like two months later and we talking for like 6 hours about what happened and everything. Then brad and one of my best friends had a "thing" but i still liked brad. But then he choice to like me, and then we went out or whatever. Him and my friend still talk A LOT, and i just feel like she still likes him but he has made it very clear he choice me. He constantly complements me and tells me how lucky he is to have me in his life. I just can't seem to open up to him, so i told him i wanted to break up after he told me he loved me. I just don't know what happened, i hate it when we are apart but once i have him i just don't care anymore.

20090306220718AAUOIz0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My gut tells me he's taking advantage? Advice?	I know that minds and hearts can be clouded and mislead.  I've been with a man for over a year.  We are both divorced with children.     His children, who are torn over their parents separation, have serious behavioral issues.  He, on the other hand, loves his children but can't handle them for very long and I usually have been left dealing with their chaos.  This has been a battle I have fought for months.      Tonight, in the middle of the night, he wakes me up to tell me he's going to work out in the morning with his workout buddy and will return home afterwords.  That means- I'm stuck with three children- two of them are his.  At this point, I struggle when they begin to exhibit their extreme behaviors.  He tells me that he wants positive experiences and nurturing people in his children's lives.  Their own mother is negligent and an abuser of Rx drugs.        He and I are not married, nor are we engaged.  We've been living together for a year.  This child situation is still out of hand.  I'm afraid that I am faced with the decision- me or his kids.  There are so many things to consider- I'm not sure what to do here.  I'm sick of being "dumped" on so he can go out and do his own thing.  What about my needs?

20090306221139AAFhM5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP- My Ex Boyfriend Is Getting High?	My ex used to smoke weed and do cocaine last year because he's a musician and thought he was mad cool, and that would fit his "rockstar lifestyle". He's getting way too ahead of himself.      Anyway he stopped a month before he met me, but continued to do it on/off while we dated, but everytime he used, he would come to me and tell me. I'd always stop him and talk him out of it, convince him not to do it anymore.      About a week ago, he told me he was depressed, and afterwards we got in an arguement and he ignored me for days but finally responded online but he was acting pretty strange. I asked him if he was high and he said "no" but was acting like he was.       A few days later, he broke up with me, because he didn't want to be "tied down" since his music is going pretty well for him, and he gave me a whole bunch of bull saying he never loved me. I was just talking to his friend and his friend told me my ex was smoking weed. He said he'd been doing it once every week.      I'm pretty sure he broke up with me because he knows if I found out he was smoking weed/getting high, I would stop him. Do you think that was the reason he left me?      If it is, what should I do? Should I talk to him about it, or should I let it go...? Please, I love him and I'm really worried about him.   Help?
20090306221101AAFu78F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm having feelings towards a friend, but I'm very shy and scared to tell her. What do you think?	That's right, another dating question. I'm 17 and in grade 12. For the longest time, I've struggled with feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. I isolated myself from people for a very long time. Last year, I decided to take a risk and I joined a club. I guess it's a good thing I did because I met this very nice and pretty girl. We have a lot of things in common. We pretty much like the same things and we have similar personalities, although she's much more social than I am. She was in grade 12 last year and came back for another semester this year. She's gone now though and I still try to keep in contact with her. She's going to university after the summer.      Something that kind of surprised me was when she opened up to me about problems she was having and has had in the past. It made me feel good that she was comfortable enough to tell me this, but it was hard for me to figure out why she was exactly. She hung out with a lot of her friends at lunch and I was there too. The nicest thing she said to me was that I was one of her close friends. I've even told her some things about myself and she has listened. She's pretty much everything I've ever wanted in a girl. She gives me hugs a lot and I give her some affection too. She told me I made this one guy jealous that had a crush on her because we were able to do this.       Basically, I think I'm in love with her. I have no idea what the future holds for us, but I want to try to get closer to her. I care so much about her and I want to do whatever it takes to make her happy. I'm going to wait a little bit until I'm comfortable, but I can't wait too long or else she'll slip away from me. I'm worried she may not return my feelings though. What do you think about this?

20090306222140AAJT84p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over a girl?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i fell in love with this girl 3 years ago. We became best friends and I've been completely in love with her for the last 3 years. She's so beautiful, that I fell in love with her the second I saw her. I can't keep my eyes off of her. We've had classes together for the last 3 years and i thought she started to like me. She kept telling me that I was smart and being really flirty. Then she started to hug me all the time (especially after winning her soccer games) and she kept telling her parents about me. I kept having these strong urges to kiss her. I would get weak at the knees when I was around her and get butterflies in my stomach and I would get really nervous around her. I was so in love with her that I wanted to marry her. I thought she was my soul mate and that we were meant to be together. She was the only thing I could think about. I kept daydreaming about her all day. The thing was I just couldn't ask her out. Every time i would try to ask her, I would freeze up and i tried to ask her out for 3 years. I tried everything and couldn't get the words out. I even bought her a ring for Valentine's Day but I was too scared to give it to her.      She just got a boyfriend and i'm just completely heartbroken. I feel completely devastated and sad. She's the only thing I can think about. I'm trying to get over her but I just can't stop thinking about her. It hurts so much. I know I have to get over her but I just can't. I can't even sleep anymore and its driving me crazy. i can't get over her. Everything I did was for her. I started MMA and going to the gym so I would look better for her. It's so agonizing when she kisses her boyfriend in front of me. She was the only part of my life that truly made me happy. She was so good at comforting me when I was down and I feel like I really need her now b/c i always feel sad. Seeing her was the only thing I actually looked forward to everyday. The only reason i wanted to go to school was so I could see her. It's just so hard to even be around her. I still have that strong urge to kiss her and I really have to restrain myself from doing it and its really hard to do. Whats even worse is that she sits next to me in math class and I have to see her everyday.      Every night when I go to bed, I always dream about kissing her or marrying her and then when I wake up I realize that it was just a dream and I feel even worse. She's the prettiest, smartest, sweetest, and most caring girl I've ever met. She's the girl of my dreams and I feel terrible all the time because I can't have her. I can't sleep and i haven't been doing as well at boxing. I feel like I can never love another girl the same way. I feel so empty and incomplete inside without her. I don't know what I did to deserve this torture. I just need some help getting over her. Can you help me out here?
20090306221219AAPqHvr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I have fun with her?	I like this girl who goes to a different school and we've only met twice. Since they are our family friends, she is coming over with her family in a week. During the last two times we have met I think she has an impression that I am a dull and boring person. How can I make her laugh and let us all have fun?      I don't mean just by talking...in my opinion actions are even better. People tell me to flirt with her but what exactly should I do?
20090306221301AAecIhP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get over my hatred of women?	Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didnt faze me as i didnt even turn around to help her as she cried, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk?
20090306221055AAeI0sO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This shy girl avoids eye contact me and takes a while to respond to my compliments. Am I ugly? GIRLS ANSWER.?	Whenever I compliment on her clothes/presentation/whatever, she looks down at the ground and smiles. She seems to think of answer for an answer and just says thanks. The other day, I gave her gum. She walks away, but turns back with a shy smile and says thanks. Whenever another guy talks to her, she responds easily. What's wrong with me?
20090306221911AA3jcK1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does he always ignore me?	I know this guy for 5 years now and he's been been ignoring me ever since. It's making me so upset though. I barely attempted to talk to him but when I do for necessary matter, he ignores me and act as though I don't exist. Ok. so he does sometime answer my question, but it's always just like "uhhh....I don't know" "uhhhh...ok..." "uhhh....yeah..." Nothing more. He wouldn't even say a single "hi" to me!       He's close friends with all of my friends - male and female, but he choses not to acknowledge me! It's been 5 years already and nothing has been changed.       A few times, I just want to attempt to make a conversation with him just because it would be awkward if we just stare for hours and say nothing, but he never really responded, but "uhhh....." "uhhh.... yeah...." "uhhhhh.....sure."       In meetings or during presentation, when I do speak, he act as if everything I am saying is not important and just whisper to people around him as I tried to make a point through the speech!       When I talk with my friends, he just comes out of nowhere and talk to them, and completely ignore my existence!       It had always bug me before, but now I'm getting really irritated. Why is he doing that?       And I don't think I am invisible either...at least I was never told that I have such special powers/abilities.

20090306224258AANwlWx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a real Love note? or a trick note?	Ok, I'm in high school, and I was in class the other day and this is the kind of school where you can trust people enough to leave your stuff around, like I left my purse on my desk to walk into the hall before class and get a soda. Well, I went through the whole day just like any other regular school day, but when i got on the bus that afternoon to go home, I found a note in my purse.      It was titled for my love "blank" (my name) Basically it says dear "blank" I have loved you since the very moment I laid eyes on your beautiful body face hair etc, My dreams are filled with visions of your beautiful voice and the image of your legs. I love the way your beautiful glistening eyes look when the light hits them just right. I have never told you this in person for fear of rejection. You are the most beautiful, absolute stunning woman that I have ever laid eyes upon.I  can't stop thinking about your body, your face, and I think you might feel the same about me because I've seen the way you look at me in our class together. Every night, all night, all I can think of is to make sweet, hot passionate love to you. If I gather up the courage, then maybe someday I will tell you who I am.      Now guys, does this sound like a guy who really has feelings for someone? or a joke?   and girls, your opinion is also welcome on this, like have you every played tricks like this on your friends or people that you don't like? any help would be appreciated, thank you.
20090306225940AAQ84IS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We have a date, but he is letting me decided where and I don't know?	So the guy I've liked for about 8 months who has known that I've liked him for about 6 of those months (he's liked me too) finally asked me out on a date. However, it's gonna be really awkward because we've really only talked a lot online and we've barely talked in person. We met through a mutual best friend and the friend convinced the guy to ask me out because he (the mutual friend) thinks that me and the guy would be a good match. Me and the guy have met a few times in person, but each time, we haven't really had a conversation because we are both really shy and we were in a group all 4 times. So our date is next Saturday and he is letting me decide what we are going to do and I really don't know. What would be the best and least awkward thing possible except movies because we've already done that twice? I was thinking ice skating or bowling or something like that. Would either of those be a good idea? We drive so it is pretty open to what we can do.
20090306230716AAElLMx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I attract crazy girls?	Alright, here's another question regarding my relationships. now, I'm considered your typical "nice guy".  I'm wondering why do I attract good looking girls with "issues"  Don't get my wrong but, i don't have a lot of negative issues. I'm relatively  chilled and have my "click" of friends that are my core friends.      However, I've been on the dating scene and have only met REALLY awkward girls.  Either something dramatic happened in there life (rape or break up with an ex wasn't there type,.)       I've met all these girls off the internet, is that a sign?       But, my current girlfriend has issues of her own, is there any girls out here that don't have issues and how can I meet you?

20090306224906AAKkh9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm I wasting my time or do I have a chance?	There's this guy in my class...he does really stupid things and always gets in trouble, but no matter how much of a jerk he makes himself seem...I just can't stop thinking and liking him. He flirts a lot with this one girl that sits next to him, and he occasionally flirts with me. He pokes my sides, squeezes my arm/leg, and tries to talk to me every now and then. I also catch him looking towards me when he's on the other side of the room. (My friends always tell me he's looking AT me, but I Just find that hard to believe.) We're nothing alike. He doesn't give a damn if he gets in trouble while I'm too scared to talk when asked not to. Well, a few weeks ago, my elementary school friend hooked him up with this one girl. I was crushed but I made sure I didn't give him any hints of it. So before the bell rang, we were talking and I made fun of so he suddenly ended up saying, "You're just mad because I broke up with Xxxxxx." I was shocked; not because they broke up, but at what he said. I don't know why he told me that. I've talked to Xxxxxx during the beginning of the year but, even before they started going out, we haven't even been sharing glances.       We've never really talked and have just joked around and exchanged comments. So do you think there's still a chance for me? Or I'm I completely out of luck?
20090306223426AAKYStb	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I get my friend to leave somthis girl alone?	Well first off there is this sort of girl who everybody laughs at but nobody cares about but my friend is literally obssesing over her.Like she will go around following her around and terrorizing this girl and when the girl says "OMG LEAVE ME ALONE WHAT DO YOU WANT!" she's like "Dont be rude! Blah blah! You need to be respectful!" and keeps following her and making rude comments. And she always wants to invite her over so she could try to make her over and make fun of her and like whenever she hears the girl say like cuss word she turns around and starts going off on her but Im like "come on...like you say that all the time!" and whever we talk this girl is always the subject and she's like talking about her how she wants to make her life bad and I'm like "why do you do this to her?" and she's like "Because she's a freak! And I'm sorry you want to be friends with a freak!"   How do I get her to leave this poor girl alone?

She texts me for long periods but she does that with other guys also. she really doesn't like staying after school but that is because her mom gets mad. She seems like she is flirting but she kinda does with another guy too but she spends way more time with me. Does she like me or is she just playing with me? Is there a way I can ask her out and still be friends if she says no? (we are in the same clubs and know the same people so it might be embarrassing)
20090306230605AAle63V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	*************HES JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU**************?	The bond that we have resembles a relationship in any way you could imagine. We sleep together, spends days with me, cooks for me, he spends money on me, I spend money on him, we volunteer together...his mama loves me...my mama loves him. We sacrifice a lot of time and the company of other people for each other...I'm into him, I'm just scared of committing (just got out of an abusive relationship) right now, I think he's enjoying this semi-free ride...thats what I'm asking. How do I know that when I'm ready to commit he's gonna be too...or if he's not gonna be (using me for what it's worth)?   We actually have pretty good communication and we have already talked about where we stand. He ALSO said he was not ready for a relationship      We aren't in a relationship...dating or not, he's pulling me out of this depression I am comming from (I got out of my bad relationship 10 months ago...then we started talking 5 months ago...for 5 months I was 100% alone)      I appreciate him for all he's done for me which is why I invest so much of my time...he matches me in generosity and as friends we just naturally fell into what we have now...

She will probably break my right arm by the end of the year if she keeps this up.      So why? Is it interest? Or does she want to fight me?

20090306230641AA6XgN4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I getting used until she can get back with her ex?	I just starting dating this girl about a month ago and I really like her but im not sure if she likes me the same amount. She broke up with her ex 4 months ago and she had a rebound guy already, so i figured i was safe. I'm not so sure anymore though. She talked to her ex and they both agreed they would see other people but i always think shes just waiting until the summer to try and get back together with him. She also told me before we were going out that she only thinks someone can be en-love with one person, and she told me she had loved her ex. I figured I could change her mind. Recently, she told me that she went into our relationship not wanting a long term thing. Is there anyway to change her mind about this and is she just using me until she can get back together with her ex?
20090306223743AAxRJHS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I an so tired of dealing with this so can you tell me if there is anything else to do?	2 years ago i needed a date to this dance so i asked this girl out and she shut me down.

We stopped at a few bars and everyone but me was drinking because I had to work tonight.  When I told my boyfriend it was time for me to go back to my car to leave for work  he said OK have a good night at work.(I didn't know the area so I wasn't sure how to find where I parked)  I said to him "Aren't you going to walk me to the car?  He said no I will not be able to find everyone when I come back.  WTF I said fine then my friend would take me since she knows the area.  He got mad at me for being upset that he was being that inconsiderate as to not even help the person you're supposed to love find their car!!!  Its not like our group of friends didnt all have cell phones to find them. OH and it was a 15 minute walk and he ended up showing me the way but he walked far ahead of me and my friend and then when we got to the car he was so mean and just kissed my cheek and said have a good night and stormed off.
20090306231117AA9qmDg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend/friend problem...?	I have a boyfriend, and him and I had sex like 3 times. The last time was on Wednesday night. He is a little rough, don't get me wrong, I love it, but still, yeah, a little rough, and so I was a little sore the next day, but I had to go to school and just like endure it.    Now, I have a guy friend who's always saying, "i love you." and calling me 'sweetheart' and 'honey' and he's one of my best friends. We have a class together, and on Thursday, the day after the sex with my bf, he noticed I was looking uncomfortable, and limping a tiny bit. I kept telling him it was none of his business why I was looking 'in pain' but when I started writing stuff on my binder about my boyfriend, he got it, and understood that I had had sex.    The problem is, Taylor(the friend) is really angry with my boyfriend. He tries to pick fights with him and my boyfriend is so competitive that he'll go along with it, and almost beat the crap out of Taylor. I love Taylor so much, as a friend, but I don't know why he's acting like this about me having sex. How can I solve this problem? and why is Taylor acting like this?
20090306234230AAOqXwu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Healthy relationships--your opinion?	I've heard a lot of things about what makes a relationship last, and a thought came to my mind.      Aside from pure love, does a healthy relationship require both people to contribute something the other person doesn't have? (Does pure love work by itself and not fade away?)      For example, let's say man A is bad at organization but good at cooking, and woman B is good at organization but bad at cooking. (Assume love is a given.) Would you say something like this is a requirement for a healthy relationship? a positive factor? or not very necessary?
20090306232848AAWBsmT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys is this really considered flirting? Girls help too?	okay so i went out with this guy (we broke up ) the night of our date he brought his friend (boy) and i brought my cousin (girl) at the time evryone was 12 now 13 or turning 13 (im 13) so there were 2 girks and 2 boys (i met the boy i went out with through my cousin because they are like really good friends) so we went to the movies nothing bad happened normal date i guess and after we went to get something to eat (after we left the movie i was really mad at him and his friend its alot to explain) but  even though we sat next to each other in a booth and across were my cousin and his friend.Later on his friend told a joke and i looked at him and laughed (and i guess the boy got jealous because he kept loooking at me in a sad/mad way lol).Then like a month later after that date him and my cousin were talking and he said you know your cousin likes my friend i could tell it in her eyes and i got confused and said what and i said why were you watching me anyways even if i did or didn't like him i was mad at you in the first place, and my cousin said so your accusing her of cheating on you with her eyes on your guy's date while sittting right next to you and he said yea, am i the only one who thinks this is weird?
20090306231838AAwZIE7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My "brother" is in love with me, what should I do?	My mother adopted a son a few years ago, he was 15 when she adopted him and I was 13 (I'm her biological child and didn't have any other siblings before she adopted him). Now he's 18 and I'm 16. I developed a close relationship with him. For quite awhile now he's been acting like he's in love with me, and when I asked him about it he came out and said that I was the most beautiful girl he's ever seen and he wants us to get married eventually. I didn't know what to say, I always thought of him as very cute/handsome but I also always thought of him as a brother. Would it be totally wrong to have a romantic relationship with him? What should I tell him without hurting his feelings too much?
20090306231704AASXJUw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you heard about the lipsticks/lipgloss that contain lead recently? (they're in popular brands) ...?	I'm part of a women's cancer club at school, and I just  received an email:      "Something to consider next time you go   Shopping for Lipstick......      This is from someone who works in   The breast cancer unit at        Mt.. Sinai Hospital in Toronto       From: Dr.   Nahid Neman       Recently a   Lipstick brand called 'Red Earth'       Decreased   Their prices from $67 to $9.90.       It contained Lead.    Lead is a Chemical which causes cancer.    The lipstick Brands that contain lead are:       CHRISTIAN DIOR    LANCOME    CLINIQUE    Y.SL.    ESTEE LAUDER    SHISEIDO RED   EARTH (Lip Gloss)    CHANEL (Lip Conditioner)    MARKET   AMERICA-MOTNES LIPSTICK       The higher the lead content, the greater   the chance of causing cancer.       After doing a   Test on lipsticks, it was found that the Y..S.L Lipstick  contained the most amount of lead.        Watch out for    Those lipsticks which are supposed to stay on   longer.        Here is the   SIMPLE TEST you can do yourself:       1 Put some   Lipstick on your hand.       2 Use a Gold   Ring to scratch on the lipstick.       3 If the   Lipstick colour changes to black,       Then you know   The lipstick contains lead.

20090307001221AACoI3O	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was becoming a dirtbag a life changing event?	When I was younger I was so shy. In highschool I never spoke a word. I was the super shy skinny dork with no friends and no girlfriend. After about 1 year after I graduated, my brother introduced me to poker. I became so fascinated with this game so after playing for fun I decided to go to a cardroom. Now, for those of you who don't know, cardrooms aren't exactly PG if you know what I mean. There are a lot of dirtbags there with their stripper girlfriends trying to make a quick buck. After interacting with these people over the course of 5 years I eventually became like them. I started working out and began dating really trashy girls (strippers and such). I am 35 now and am about to get married to a beautiful and intelligent woman and was just curious how I got to this point. I have since quit gambling and sleeping around but sometimes I think to myself that if I never interacted with these people, I would have been a quiet loner for the rest of my life. Your thoughts?

I asked her if she needed any help, like i do with all customers..she did have a question, and by the time i was done helping her I was really hard, it just happened, something about her...anyway it was big and my shirt was tucked in and my dress pants didn't hide it very well...then she said 'oh one more thing' as i turned to walk away so i came back and helped again, and then she had me help her with a couple more things...was she using her position as a customer to make me, the worker, stay there helping her because she noticed i was hard for her and wanted to make it stay that way instead of letting me go try to hide it or lose it?  If so was it punishment for being obvious or was it just fun for her? I had some painful blue balls before she left the store

20090307000501AAZxdqj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am super confused with my girlfriends actions?	Hello all. I have been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 yrs now. She is still in a heated battle with her ex(husband) over custody issues, money etc. I have been there for her from day 1 helping her with everything from moving out to buying a car, to being a role model for her 2.5 yr old son, etc. I have spent countless amounts of money as well because I know she is hurting financially. She has been going through a rough time with holidays, with lawyers fighting over silly stuff, she has a custoday evaluation going on, and now she just found out her ex is having another kid with his new girlfriend. She bugged out this past weekend because she found out and she went to go see her sister. I was confused because I ALWAYS talk about EVERYTHING with her. I didnt understand why she shut me out, and it sparked a jealousy rage inside of me. I thought that because she was so upset that she was going to go out and do whatever at here sisters place since she has a male roomate. I am not sure how I became insecure, but I got real jealous after she said that she was going to get wasted. We are both in our late 20's and I should have acted more maturely I know that. Well I did not leave her alone all weekend, when she asked for space. She was real real angry at me. She came home and I still didnt give her space, I stopped over with food for her, and called her etc, when all she wanted was space. She became furious after I didnt let her be and she said that it was over. I feel like a jerk now, and I need to get her back. I acted like a child and got jealous for no reason. I tried to give her space all week, but I ended stopping over her place on wednesday with flowers and a card, this made her more mad. Tonight we went to a concert and she wouldnt kis me or hold my hand. We had a great time but it was weird. She has not removed my pictures from her wall, or given me my stuff back from her place, or ask for her stuff. We have a joint cell phone acount (she also has another phone) and she hasnt given it back or asked me to canel it.She said that she has so much going on with the evaluation, lawyers, and just findinig out that her ex was having a child to worry about our relationship. We were a HUGE part of eachothers life until this happened. I dont ask her for much just some affection everyonce and a while. Not sure what to do here. She says that she is real mad about me checking up on her and not giving her space this weekend. To break up with me though is a bit much I think. Have I just not given her enough time to not be mad? DO I need to give her a certain amount of space? She said tonight that she appreciated me fighting so hard for her that she was upset at me still, and I wouldnt give her space. Help here please, I care for her a lot and I would like to get her back. My family loves her, I love her son, I love her family, etc. Is she confused? not thinking clearly? Help!!

20090306233154AATuaUB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In india if at the time of marriage on 30-4-1968, and bride's birth date was 14-9-1950 is it legal?	The marriage was done on 30-04-1968 and at the bride's birth date is 14-09-1950 i.e. she had not completed 18 years at that time. Now, the couple had completed almost 41 years of their marriage life having 2 son of age of 40 and 38 and a daughter having age of 29 years.       The daughter is pregnant at Australia and mother has no passport. For getting passport, she must have marriage certificate. They approached registrar's office but are informed that at the time of marriage the bride had not completed 18 years therefor their marriage is illegal.       My question is whether the marriage is illegal and what are the remedies for the same i.e. for making passport.      An early reply will be highly appreciated.

20090307011629AA9vaGy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to seduce someone that you rarely see?	I dated my ex for almost 3 years and still have strong feelings for him. I have a really hard time having sexual feelings for guys I don't know well or have no emotional connection with, so I think I'll be fantasizing about my ex until I meet someone new, which is a pain cuz we're not on good terms and I don't like thinking about him in a positive way.    Anyways, the ONLY other guy who I've felt any attraction towards is one of my ex's close friends. I know that he thinks I'm hot, that he is always looking to get laid, and that he doesn't have a problem with sleeping with his friends' ex-gfs (long story but he's proven each of those at some point).    I keep having fantasies of seducing him and stuff, but the problem is is that I almost never see him anymore. It's important to me to find someone to be attracted to cuz I'm so tired of thinking about my ex; I was really excited when I realized that I had some feelings for this guy.   Anyways, are there any ways that I could let him know I'm interested? If I run into him around campus (fortunately we go to the same small school so I could probably run into him more if I hung out outside), what could I say? Or would it be a bad idea to associate with any of my ex's friends, even if I'm genuinely attracted to them?    Btw, I'm graduating in May so I really don't care about my "reputation" or if it's wrong to hook up with a close friend of my ex-bf. I've made enough sacrifices for him and now I just want to have fun!

My boy("friend") just got out of jail last monday after two years of being locked up. i went and saw him that night, but since then he hasn't invited me over and when i try to text message him on the phone, he hardly replies. he gets drunk every night and plays Warcraft constantly... i'm feeling ignored. he's currently having to live with his mother and she doesn't like me just because i don't have a job. could that be the problem? ...i dont know. i'm feeling neglected. i don't know if he's purposefully ignoring my text messages or just doesn't notice his phone going off cause i think he leaves it on silent all the time. i just don't know. he wont get on any messengers on the computer cause all he wants to do is play WoW.... i thought things were going to be different after he got out :( he wants me to play WoW with him but, since i have NO JOB i can't pay the monthly fees. he said he would do it for me but he hasn't come through with that promise yet... i just don't know. we've known each other since jr high... we're past college age now. i'm just so tired of being alone. i wish he would go out and get a job and get his own place again. then things might be better... at least i would be able to go to his house and sit within his company without having to worry about anyone else getting pissed that guests are in their house. ....meh. advice?

20090307014753AATc2UR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What if he doesn't want kids?	My boyfriend and I have been in a loving, committed relationship for three years.  He makes comments (not often) sometimes about how he doesn't think you need to get married to have a committed relationship.  And that he doesn't really want kids.      Yet he's also said that he can see himself marrying someone if they've been together for years and years and he knows he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.  But that he just doesn't think the institution of marriage in and of itself is all that necessary.      As for kids, he volunteers with kids and loves it... and he's made comments that he would be open to adopting children, but he's kind of frightened of having his significant other get pregnant and give birth.  He's worried that he wouldn't find her body attractive anymore.  (Not that he's saying that's okay, but just that it's what he worries about happening).      He does tell me, and show me, that he loves me, and often.  And he's made it clear that he wants to spend the rest of his lief with me.      I'm just wondering, is it normal for men to send mixed messages like this?  What should I think about it?      I know for a fact that I do eventually want to get married and have children of my own.  So I don't want to end up spending more and more years with him, only to find that we break up over something I should have foreseen - him not wanting marriage or babies.      Do you think that he really doesn't want marriage or children of his own, or is it that he doesn't really know what he wants yet?  Is this common with young men?  He's 24 if that matters.      I'm willing to wait several years before engagement or anything like that.  I'm only 22 and understand that there's no rush.  I just don't want to be stuck wondering about these same things when I'm 30!      Thank you in advance. :)

20090307020115AAc8UAB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why are so many marriages unsuccessful?	Looking in the marriage and divorce section, I find it somewhat disconcerting that there are just SO many questions about divorce, cheating, marriages not working...      I mean,  it's called "Marriage and DIVORCE", it's like there can't be one without the other.      I'm recently engaged, and sure I'm probably idealistic, but I don't think marriage and divorce should be saddled together like that.      I want my vows to MEAN "til death do us part".

20090307014756AAXYl9K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do, my vagina is ruining my life?	My sexual experience is pitiful. I lost my virginity at 20 because I needed to get it over with. I wasn't attracted to the guy and as a result sex was unpleasent in the limited time we dated. I never got wet and I was too tight so penetration hurt a lot and a ton KY was essential. For 8 years I remained abstinent ashamed of myself for the past mistake I made and now patiently waiting this time for the perfect guy for me. I've found him. He is everything I could ever have dreamed or fantisized about in the flesh. I work with him. We are collegeaus working in the same field, both of us initially single, he's 4 years older, and he is superior to me intellectually. I look up to him tremendously. Am totally in love. We have known each other 2 years and have been dating for a month now. I have told him I am inexperienced with men and sex. He has been very understanding from the beginning. Our relationship got to the point wherevI thought it was time to take the next step. When it came down to it I was scared of course, but thought since I loved him so much my body would react correctly. I always feel the deepest sensations when I think about him and see him. I had no KY and thought it was not necessary. BUT the same damn thing happened again. It was difficult for him to penetrate me in any position. He seemed very understanding about the situation handling it as if it were my first time, but I feel so ashamed. We had sex and he was able to climax because I acted as if I was really enjoying the vigouous sex (although dry), but I suffered a lot of vaginal pain. And had some blood when a urinated the next day (which has stopped). Women: What the hell is wrong with my vagina? Men: Would you stop caring for the girl if she couldn't get wet or was unpleasently tight during sex? Would you think she wasn't attracted to you sexually?

We always get in a rut about sex; he seems to never want it... maybe twice a week, and I seem to want it every day! Most nights I feel undesirable and horribly self-conscious. I do a lot of different things and I keep the variety coming, but every time I go to talk about it with him, he completely disregards what I say and says I'm being stupid about it. What do I do?
20090307012743AAUiM7m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats your views on age gaps?	Just wondering whats your views on a 7 year age gap where the woman is the older partner?       My best friend is currently very attracted to an 18 year old but shes 25, I personally thinks its ok cause he really likes her back! Shes been through so much including an attempted rape and consequently depression. I think this would do her some good some fun with a really great guy!      What do you think??

20090307015437AAM3jic	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I decided that I want a scene/emo girl, where are the takers?	Yeah so I'm 19 and sexy. I've always thought scene/emo girls were very unique and hott and so I've come to the conclusion that I want one. I am open minded, a great conversationalist, and I have a great sense of style. I'm very knowledgeable and diversified in my music because I love it.       Here are the qualifications:     Black or blonde hair with crazy colored highlights (pink, green, etc)   Different piercings (nose, lip, etc)   Not many emo/scene friends that I would have to hang out with   No deep emotional problems      So if you know any or have "scene" (I'm clever) any then let me know. Or if you know where I can find one then get in touch..I'll send you a cookie. Seacrest out..

20090307020027AARbYHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy Problem Please Help me!!!!?	So I got into a huge fight with a guy that I have been dating and we haven't spoken for over a month. And recently I was sitting with my friends in the college lounge and he comes over to us and asks one of my friends a question. We did not talk. But my friends told me that he was looking at me from time to time.       Then this week, he comes to me again and he asks if i still have his papers and I said I did and he said if he could have them back! (By the way the papers are for Calculus I, and he already finished with that course)    Then he left and I went after him saying I am sorry for what happened and he told me he would like to be nothing more than friends. He also said that we either could be friends or if we still were not talking then he would be fine with that          If he wants to be friends or if he says he doesnt mind NOT being my friend, then why is he making an effort to show up randomly in my face like that, TWICE??? I really need an explanation       Thank you so much    Jill

20090307033550AATvrKE	Family & Relationships;Family	Can an older sister be a father figure to her little brother?	My parents are divorced and my brother doesn't get to see our dad or talk to him or anything, because our mom convinced us to ask stopping to see him about 6 years ago. And I've ever since been worried for my little brother, he's now 10 years old going onto 11, and it's been six years since his parents are divorced. I'm 18, so I've had the chance to live and see who my dad is, and he was an amazing father. He was very nurturing, and gave all his time and love to make me a happy little girl. I know that my brother would have absolutely lived his dream if my father was with us today, and I want to know how I can somehow be something close to being a father figure like my father was to me until he sees him again. What can I do?

20090307024652AAUgea2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to let a guy know that you want sex?	I'm an attractive, single girl so it would seem easy for me to get laid, but I'm shy and don't go out too often so I've been in a bit of a dry spell. I also don't want to sleep with just anyone, it has to be a guy who is somewhat attractive and not creepy. But I've been heartbroken for several months, I'm not looking for anything more than a hook-up buddy, so my standards are not as high as they normally would be.   Anyways, when I go out in public and especially to a bar or club, what can I do to make myself seem available? Again, I'm pretty and all but just kind of awkward when it comes to flirting. Whenever I try to be sexy, I just seem ridiculous lol. Any suggestions? I don't want to seem too forward.

There's a group date which im going to this weekend, with a couple of church buddies. We have to bring someone form the opposite sex to come along. I invited someone but im not interested in her, only as friends. ive never date before, but everyone keeps calling it a date. Were all baking cookies and then having a barbecue on the beach later. I just hate when people call it a date cause i thought my first date would be with someone im interested in, is this a date?

20090307022106AAtJ4Vx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I cried during sex is he mad at me?	The last few times me and my partner have made love I have got upset and started crying. Obviously this isn't what any guy wants but I tried to explain it is because of my rape experience a few years ago. He just said he wasn't ready to talk about it,that I shouldn't of hung around those guys and acted like I had done something wrong. He still kept saying he wanted to f*ck me which didn't help.       I feel so hurt he wouldn't even talk to me about it. We are serious about each other but he has a selfish streak sometimes. I want to just leave him because of this because he doesn't think anything he does is wrong. I need him to be supportive, what can I do?

20090307025518AA8rhSs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	So what is gonna happen? Or wut COULD happen?	It started with these two guys that got in a fight, will and joe, so will is my girlfriends brother and he and joe got into a fight inside of will's house. Joe's friend james wuz about to get in for joe when this other guy put a knife on james throat and told him to think twice about getting in for joe, so james didnt do jack after that. Well it turns outthat joe took off running ( leaving his car there at will's house) because he thought he wuz gonna get jumped or sumtin, i dont kno he got scared... So after joe took off running will  broke all of joes cars windows, its like MESSED UP bad, i kno i think he shouldnt have done that, but anyways joes girlfriend ends up pressing charges on will because of what he did, ( by the way this joe guy is freaken bad, like he has guns, connections and all this stuff ), so can the cops really do anything because the car is in will's driveway? by the way there isnt really that much evidence that will did it...
20090307033701AAxBdZj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still like me or not? How can you tell?	I met this guy 4 years ago. We've been and are great friends. We now call each other, "Besty". But 3 years ago, he confessed he liked me. I wasn't sure of what to say. I really like him a lot, but I had to say "no". We were young and, I wasn't ready. Now I'm regretting, but I know I made the right choice. Who has a boyfriend at age 12? Now, I'm confused. I'm not sure if he still likes me. I doubt he does.       But there were several cases where his sweetness towards me was kinda awkward.      CASE 1:   He used to text me, day and night, saying "Good Morning", "Good Night", "I miss you" and all those kind of things. But the day came when I had no time to load up my phone so I couldn't text him back. It was Christmas Vacation. When classes resumed, he was sitting in front of me and he said, "No load? Or you just didn't want to text me back?". I apologized and things were great.      CASE 2:   He held my hand one time. I was wearing a ring. He went beside me and said, "I'll take this ring off so we will be enemies.". I said, "Why do you want us to be that way?". Although he was about to take it off, he put it back on.       CASE 3:   In YM, he gave me an emoticon of a rose and said it was for me.      CASE 4:   Whenever we fight, he'll be the one to apologize, even if it was my fault.      CASE 5:   He used to call me everyday and we spend HOURS talking on the phone.      CASE 6:   My best friend told me he has a picture of me on his cel. I asked her if it was a stolen one, and she said no. I asked her if she was only joking and gave me a serious answer, "no". But still, I didn't believe her.      CASE 7:   In class, I sit next to him and he always talks to me. (He's kind of a chatterbox)      But there were cases where he looks like he MOVED ON.      CASE 1:   He had 2 girlfriends AT THE SAME TIME.       CASE 2:   Once when we were talking on the phone, he told me how much he loved his current girlfriend.      CASE 3:   He's sweeter to another girl in my class. (And this girl? She's such a flirt and was once a 2-timer)      CASE 4:   The flirty girl told me that this guy will change (from being a 2-timer) for her. :((      CASE 5:   In Friendster, he never leaves me messages but he does to other girls. I'm not even in his friends list.      CASE 6:   Now, he just calls when it's about Homework.      So, what do you think? Does he still like me or not?

20090307032406AAL6Ywd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Smell of perfume on my spouses chest...guys opinion?	I've had a feeling that my husband might be cheating on me for a while now but was always able to toss it aside in my head because there was never really any strong signs until...I'm not sure if I'm being crazy or not. Its been twice now that I've smelled a strong aroma of perfume. The first time was when I came home from work (I work midnights) and slipped into bed while he was still sleeping and there was a smell of perfume on my pillow (it wasnt my perfume), the second was just the other day I was laying next to him on the couch and when I put my head on his chest a strong aroma of perfume was there (just on his pecks no where else). I confronted him and he just laughed it off. I spoken about it to a family member that I'm close to and she says she couldnt see him cheating because he doesnt seem the type. I'm going crazy thinking about it though. I've even looked into setting up an audio recorder or something but feel guilty about doing it. He has a problem with getting it up most of the time anymore and he is on blood pressure medicine which could be the cause but since I've smelled the perfume I started questioning the whole blood pressure medicine cause for it. It hurts to think that he might cheat on me so I'm not sure what to make of it. There is a girl that I think is interested in him but I dont know if she would try anything or not being that shes my sister in law's sister and that shes a recoverying druggie and I'm in law enforcement so I think she has a fear of me. When shes around us she wont ever look at him like shes purposely trying not to and she wont look me in the eye when talking to me. Its just a thought What do you think???

20090307032253AAvs3Vw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Do you think he feels ????? Guys and Girls!!?	Well I absolutely love this guy named Ian as soon as I saw him on the first day of school. Ian knows I like him. Ian is single! On Thursday we had Japanese and I just so got to share a laptop with him. We were suppose to be doing our work but Me and Ian were just talking and he said "I love being around you when you help me like this". I told him on MSN that I love when a guy can make me laugh and the next day at school he was just making me laugh all day(like he was trying to). In Science Ian was sitting behind me and he kept kicking my chair and than he pulled my hair in a playful way though. At school he always says hey steph whats up. He is the love of my life (at least so far). I like him heaps and he knows i "like" him but not how much. Why does he do all the stuff and say all these things to me?

20090307040653AATmLM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think of settling for Mr. Almost Perfect?	I was reading my Grazia magazine, and it had a rather interesting article. A woman was asking if she should have 'settled for Mr Good Enough'. She was in a relationship heading toward marriage/having kids. Her fiance was almost perfect, yet something didn't feel quite right, so she left.       I was in a similar situation, I was in a relationship that was almost perfect, yet something didn't feel quite right, so, I ended it- something which I still sometimes regret. Now, a good few months on, we've both moved on somewhat.      Should people settle for an 8/10 guy, and appreciate what they have? Or should people wait for 'the one'? What do you think and what would you have done in the situation?

20090307023717AAzb219	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bf was out drinking and then came home?	Me & my bf's sex life has been pretty bad lately and hes been having troubles keeping it up or getting it to stay up (at the beginning of our reltationship he wasnt like this).      We get sex every now and then when he can, but once last week it was pretty good. He came home, he had been out drinking at his friends place, he says males only. So i thought maybe it was the alcohol that made him like he was in the bedroom.      But wen i was talking to a male friend of mine he said it was a load of crap and that another girl probably made him horny. So guys, from what you know of each other, what do u think happened?
20090307024813AALWCuW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I know a girl. she wants me to go for arrange marriage but I  propose for love marriage.What is best?	I live in india , where dowry system though lawfully banned by law still socially not recognised and people demand huge dowry from girls parent. In love marriage , which is  not so uncommon to india , there is no such bargaining. Is my proposal  good ? In love marriage , the parent of the groom may not accept the girl and boy and they will be left on their luck. The parent will not be responsible for failure of marriage at a later date  when the devil of love disappears. Please give a good suggestion .

20090307030048AAGSAtY	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What went through her mind?	Well a few days before I asked my girl to marry me I felt the need to thank a woman.This woman is now 41 years old married with two children.I have to tell you that I was in love with her a few years back but anyway back to the present.      I invited her to the brunch party that we had since they are good friends of my parents.On the phone(since we are a few miles away) I invited her and told her about the engagement.      I also told her that I felt the need to thank her for being the prototype of a woman Ive been looking for.At first she seemed surprised telling me "shouldnt your mother be that prototype"?      I replied that Im not one of those guys.She seemed very surprised and thanked me again and again.      Now especially to you ladies what would you think if a guy went out and said that to you?      Looking forward t o your responses.      (Was she flattered?Did she get a drift that maybe Ihad/have been seeing her differently?..etc)      Thanks for your time

20090307033508AABP6Zw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why would he cheat AGAIN?	I was seeing a guy who I didnt know was married, his wife found out when she found a text from him to me - and then I in turn found out he was married when she called me up and told me she's the wife.      I obviously don't know exactly what happened behind closed doors but I know that he didn't want to lose her; that's OK, I made my peace with that, and told myself I was lucky I wasn't the cheated wife. Hey if she took him back, she must have believed he won't do it again, and if he does, well, she chose to stay with him so she reaps what she sows.      The question is - only a few weeks later, he has come back to me and asked me to start again. I can tell he's trying to act restrained - whereas previously he was very, very passionate and emotional with me. But bits of the "old" him are coming back, eg when I don't answer the phone, he phones repeatedly.      We only had sex a few times, it was mostly hanging out and talking about his life/dreams etc. I said things which I know made him feel good about himself, and lively again.      So why would he come back to me if his wife has taken him back? Is he taking a ridiculous risk, or maybe the wife has agreed to turn a blind eye? (I suspect it's the second).
20090307034332AAHUhqb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does my husband have the right on the weekends ( with 2 kids under five ) to sleep till 10am?	We had an argument about something stupid and then all sorts of things came out of the woodwork, as they do. My husband works long hours up at 5am home 5pm, study 2 nights a week-home at 9.30pm. I have been a SAHM for the last three years, with a regular house cleaning job once a fortnight. Our oldest just started school and our youngest is attending day care 3 days a week, I have just started a part time course (3 days a week)  to help me get back into the workforce.      He say's that it's not too much to ask for me to keep them quiet in the morning so he can sleep in. I say that, that part of his life is over now that he has children. They come first and you can't expect them to be quiet, they are kids! He managed to keep them quiet today when I was in bed sick and thinks I should do the same. He complains that he doesn't get any time to himself , where I can stay up till 1.30am and have time to myself (I sacrifice my sleep, so I can have this time).      The argument got out of hand and he threw the headphones at me and started to smash the computer monitor. He has a history of being short tempered and has done a anger management course to try and help himself. We have been together nearly 14 years. We argue frequently.      I am feeling depressed most of the time as he is moody, bangs things around, which makes me feel uncomfortable. He say's I also am moody, I think I am pretty even tempered most of the time.      I said I was leaving with the kids today and after discussing it he said he would go, when questioned on this he then said he had no where to go (I was going to a hostel).       I don't feel the kids should have to put up with this violence. He does say he is sorry and say's it's not acceptable. I know he has changed a lot over the years and has made an effort.      Other comments are "It's his car and I couldn't take it because it's in his name". "You live here, with free board and bed". Comments like this make me feel like we live in the 50's! Where the husband expects the kids to be seen and not heard and the wife to be waiting with his pipe and slippers!      My question is , do I continue? I don't feel we communicate very well and seriously doubt my love for him sometimes. If you have been in this situation could you give me some tips please.      Sorry this was long winded but it helped clear my head.

20090307041108AAZIk9u	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your husband loves his father and his nephew more than you?	My husband and i frequently argued about his father and his nephew (six year old boy). My hubby wanted me to accept the boy as our child since we don't have a child yet. And then he wanted also to get his father to live with us.  I hate all these things so much. On top of it all, i cannot accept the child nor his father. I felt that he were removing my rights to have a child of my own. Last december, he said that whether i like it or not, we will still separate ways because of his father  and his nephew, that the more important thing for him is his father. That blood is thicker than water. How about the time i spent with him? Taking care of him and loving him? Sometimes, learning that his father is visiting us makes me shiver and tremble in with so much hatred in my heart.

20081106105515AAY5lNI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need a little support?	I was with my partner for nearly 3 years.   We have a 9 month old son together but we have been banting and arguing pretty much all the way back to the start of our relationship.    The past year we have been breaking-up and getting back together near-enough every week because he had knocked my confidence ALOT and i really believed he was the only guy that will ever like me.    He used to insult my body after giving birth to our son, he used to "tell me to put my clothes on and be all errggh" and it really used to upset me but he would be like "god i was messing" but because i put on 2 stone after giving birth to my son im gobsmacked everytime he says something, hes always going on about me "losing weight" we argue day in - day out. He mentally upsets me all the time. He refuses to work, we then lived seperatly as we cannot live together happily, then not living together we couldn't get on.. he was more inlove with his friends and his Xbox that himself, and when he used to come "visit" me and our son he would NEVER help out with our son. Well i believed on Monday that Enough is Enough and believe is time for me to grow up and get out of such a horrid relationship more so for my poor son, i don't want him seeing this. Even though we would never argue infront of him, im still certain he would pick up on the atmosphere. Its not really a question of "did i do the right thing" its more support i need on making sure i can get through this ok in the end, and there is hope for me that i might find someone else one day in the future.      Thanks very much in advance :)

Okay..So today me and two of my aunts go over to my bf's house bcuz they wanted to meet him.We've been dating for almos a year now nd he hasnt met my family bcuz I like to take things slow. We basically bumb rushed him in front of his house while he was out there working on his car with his bro n neighbor. So..wen we roll up i'm in the backseat with the window rolled up jus watchn his confusion for a minute b4 I roll it down. So later on tonite..he tells me how his bro. wanted to tlk to my aunt or watevr n I'm like..ok who cares..then he proceeds to make a bad joke n say..."I didnt evn know u were n the backseat,wudnt that have been funny if i wuda tried to holla?..(laffs out loud)..U shudnt of rolled the window down"...So this pissed me off..was i jus being sensitive or wat?

I've tried not being on him so much but he then only misses me for a bit n stuff goes back to how it was before..  A prime example is last weekend when I went to a party with a co-worker n he calls me nd I answer but wasnt able to hear him bcuz of the loud music so wen I tex him askn him wats up and wat he's doin a few minutes later, he's like "...missin u"..Which is soo lame when I miss him all the time bcuz i luv being with him...How can I get him to change his ways permanently?

My personality is not too bad and I'm not afraid to strike up a conversation.       I still don't have a job as college is my first priority. I just joined Phi Theta Kappa (National Honors Society), and haven't met anybody new in there yet, no other clubs or anything...       now to my point... I was thinking, and I'm not sure if this sounds crazy or not, but I think the only way for me to meet new people  might be to just approach people around my college campus that seem "in my league."

20090307005844AAOlEiv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend always wants to stay on the phone....?	We live about an hour apart and see each other on weekends.  As a result my gf of a year expects me to always call like every day.        But sometimes when she calls, I don't know I'll have other things I want to get through or want to unwind after work or something.  And besides an hour a day on the phone is a large chunk of postwork presleep hours.        We talk so much that once every thing has been said there's not much to talk about but still she'll want to stay on, even if we get to a stretch where there's not much to say.  I've started near the end of the calls to say "so is there anything else new with you" to end my calls but she's caught on.  Now whenever I say that she'll be like "I know what you're doing you're trying to get off the phone" or "I always get nervous and not know what to say when you say that" as if my statement was mean't as a confrontational bye or something.  Still I mean by that time at least 45 mins have been used so I don't think I'm out of line.        Still how best to handle this sort of thing because last time I said "so is anythign else new with you" she said no and abruptly hung up sounding obviously upset.

20081103105905AA8q04N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	THIS IS SO TRUE!!!!!?	Alright so I did a study at my high school on what do girls really want!   And all of these girls say "oh personality is better than looks" WELL!!!!!!!!!!! LET’S SEE SHALL WE!      Okay so at my high school I went to 20 girls (I did this during the entire school year) and set them up with two guys, one guy very attractive but a di*ck*head, the other weird looking but very nice and funny, now before I set this up I asked all the girls what was more important, and they ALL said personality.       Now I always knew this was bullshit because I've seen it happen a million times! So basically all of these girls that say they like personality more thank looks, its a lie boys! Out of the 20 girls guess how many chose the personality? 0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ZERO!!!!! ZERO! All the girls much rather be seen with a hot guy than a ugly guy, so there you go girls are ALWAYS! Selfish (unless they are ugly). Also don't go and say "well it's because you are in high school" my cousin did the same thing at his university and same thing came up, ZERO! Maturity has nothing to do with this lol.   
20081009104615AA4jR8K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I send him a message? Please help 10 points for best answer! ?	Okay here is the situation:   Do you think this means anything or I am reading too much into things?      So on Sunday my guy told me that things have to end between us because of issues I have going on in my life that prevent me from committing fully as well as things going on in his life that he needs to take care of. He said he was afraid we would end up hurting each other and didn’t want that because he cares too much for me and wants there to be a chance for us in the future. He told me he is always a phone call away if I want to talk. So Monday we talked a bit and Tuesday we exchanged one text message. Wednesday was the first full day we didn’t talk at all in over 9 months.       So Wednesday night around 10PM he called my brother and left him a voicemail of which my brother let me listen to…my guy sounded different kind of like he had been crying cause he was all stuffed up, you could tell he was trying to be upbeat but it came across as he was down. Maybe he just had allergies but both me and my brother were thinking the same thing that it sounded as he had been crying. ON the voicemail he just said “hey, hope things are going good, just seeing how your week is going, stay in touch and just say hi to (my name) for me.” Do you think this means anything like he is having a hard time with his decision or just that he likes my brother and wants to stay in touch with him even though him and I aren’t together anymore?      I am thinking of sending him a message this morning as I feel his call last night was a way to get me to contact him since he sounded so upset on his message for my brother....here is what I am thinking of sending:   "hello, good morning. I know what you told me sunday and I hope you don't think i am disrespecting your decision. I was just thinking of you and wanted to say hi. how are you?"   should I just hold off on sending a message or do you think I should go ahead and do so?

20090306222137AAEdcFg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The "dollface" experiment?	I've read somewhere that women are more attractive when they have large eyes, small nose, and a small jaw. Like a babydoll. But I wondered if that were actually true, so I did a small experiment with photoshop.

We pretty much get along. She even spotted me at a restaurant out of the blue and then added me on facebook. One time, we were suppose to meet up at a park we're not too familiar with. Long story short, we called each other that we're in the area, but weren't able to find each other for a while and we were frustrated. So, we agreed to just go home and meet some other time. Later, as I was going through my friends list, I noticed she deleted me. WHY? Before I call her about it, what do you think?

20090306222219AATVOtH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help with this!?	have this guy that i have been bestfriends with since i was around 15 and im 23 now! We fell in love years ago and we dated once but we decided we had alot of experimenting to do in life before we could get serious! He recently came back into my life about 2 months ago. At first if was GREAT but now its not so great for me!      We Live in different states for starters. We text ALL DAY and then finally around 12 midnight he calls me. This really bothers me because i dont understand why he waits all day to call. He doesnt work so i dont understand what the hold up is. I often wonder if its another girl. Sometimes he waits so late that we he ends up falling asleep and we dont talk at all and boy do i get pissed!!      So my questions is...Is this worth the stress that im putting into this. I mean i love him with all my heart. he's my best friend but i dont see this going anywhere. he doesnt have a high school diploma, he smokes weed all day long, he's still in a gang(i mean who's in a gang anymore) and he lives at home with him mom! What should i do! he really does love me and it would CRUSH him if i said that i didnt want to be with him! he feels that im all he has that im the only one that truly loves him. im trying to help him become a better person...Im trying to find the good in this....is there any hope!?
20090306230702AAwObHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i over reacting...Any advice would be great!?	A few days ago I played a prank om my guys friend. Long story short we’ve known each other since we were around 15. at 19 I moved away but I came back to see him when I turned 22. In this past year I have gained over 50 pounds. I use to be really small and now im chubby. He always talks about how he remembers me but he dosnt know what I look like now. I told him that I felt like he would treat me different if he knew what I looked like. He promised me that there would be NO difference because its all about what matters on the inside and that he truly loves me!          I sent a pic of a large woman and made him think it was me because I wanted to see how he would react. He was very shocked. Later on I sent a pic of the real me. After that I asked him if I had really looked like the first pic would he still want to take me around his friends and he told me no because he would have been embarrassed because he is known for having girls with real nice bodies. My feeling were really hurt and I haven’t really wanted to talk to him because I look at him different…was I wrong to do this and am I over reacting?

Ele também disse que se for pra gente ter algo, que seja só beijar e mais nada, se rolar, rolou. Eu nao aceitei isso e disse que eu gosto demais dele pra fazer isso, que qdo a gente gosta de alguém a gente assume, luta contra tudo e todos como eu estava fazendo (meus pais s?o contra, e eu estava disposta a enfrenta-los, e esse foi um dos motivos que levou o termino do namoro). Nao quis voltar a "ficar" com ele pq um ex meu já fez isso comigo, falava q gostava de mim e naum gostava era nada, ficava com outras e so qria saber de me sacanear. O que vcs axam da minha atitude?

20090306233304AAbYG9e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I just thinking that he likes me because I like him?	Well he's my classmate in one subject and when we first met he was pretty nice and such a gentleman!   We had a chit chat and when the class ended, he asked me if I'd like to have the computer program we use in our class - which is good cos I'm so dumb at it. Then he offered to drive me home because of the pouring rain! He's so nice its so hard to concentrate! Lol   Then when we were near my place he asked if he could give me a tour around the city since I was new and of course I said yes, I don't have anything to do anyway.      We went for a drive and he offered me this 2 uni books I needed for another class which are totally for free. Like, hello? He's like God's gift or what? Lol..      But anyway we're study buddies now (he asked me if I want to) and I can't really complain because he's pretty smart about it..         And last night after he dropped me home I introduced him to my parents since he suggested so maybe my dad won't too funny about me having a male study buddy...      Out of all people I liked, he's the odd one - he's not the badboy type and I'm nearly losing my sanity with the thought of him.      Do you think he likes me or am I just seeing how he treats me in a different way because I like him?

20090306225828AACvrWC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Now that was an unusual first date!  How should we proceed without getting her bored? (college people)?	I asked her to hang out Friday night.  We ended up walking for 2 hours in New York City at 10pm, on random streets.  The whole time we were just going back and forth with the teasing.      Anyhow, we get along amazingly well.  She's a really different girl too - no game playing at all!  Except for one time when she immediately introduced herself to a passing hot guy and talked to him for 10 minutes while shooting me glances (I totally understand hahaha.)  But she didn't go further and while we left, she almost completely ignored him.  I thought that was the coolest thing.      It was not one of those "okay, lets have a dinner and a movie" dates.  We just hung out for 3-4 hours and then grabbed some food.  Didn't feel like a date at all.  Seriously, the way we talked, it was like we were already girlfriend/boyfriend.  None of this "will you call me again?"  stuff.  We've only known each other for 2 weeks!      But since this isn't the normal dating pace, how should I do this?  I see her in class Monday - Do I hang out with her Monday night, or wait till next weekend?  She seems waaaaaaaay too into me.  She doesn't seem like a game-playing girl; If I go slow, she might lose interest - if I move too fast, again she might lose interest.  In my case, what should I do?  Obviously I'm not going to hang out with her every day before we're even official!

Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didnt faze me as i didnt even turn around to help her as she cried, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk?
20090307041636AAOJyTs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So...is it OK to be friends with an ex-boyfriend from 20 years ago?	I went out with a guy for a bit under a year 20 years ago. It wasn't a hugely passionate thing but we were great friends through it, and afterwards.  We've been friends ever since and my husband of 13 years gets along well with him. We were pretty much kids when we dated so I don't think of him in that way.      Anyway, his new wife wants him to cut off from me completely. I only talk to this guy every few months and see him at weddings, funerals, birthday parties. I am happily married, I have two kids. He is married with one on the way. We're mature, we're friends, no worries. So why is she doing this? Is it because I've known him longer than she has? Because I know his family?  And what do I do...even if he wants to stay friends do I just back away and never contact him again? It just seems so immature and so petty. My husband is in contact with ex girlfriends from his younger days and I am quite happy with it.

20090307003706AAVijY3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He is cute, showing signs but he might like this other girl that looks a lot like me? What do you think?	I met this guy in my english class this semester. Since the first day, I have found him cute. He was flirting with one of my semi-friends at the beginning.I was dissapointed but I still tried to make an effort. Usually, I am the major shy type but somehow I managed to be super outgoing towards him. Then a few weeks down the road. He's been giving me signs that he likes me too... I think. 1. He sits directly behind me, mutters to himself and like I had in the beginning, since I was trying to make a effort or get a chance for him to like me. I would start up a converstation with him if I could when he muttered something interesting. He seems like he does more now. 2. He's really tall so when he slouches down his legs stick out kind of far, so when I slouch which is a usual and comfortable way to sit for me my elbow hangs low and his knee touches my elbow. Lol, I know it sounds lame but trying to get feedback. Anyway, whenever I slounch and he's upright position it seems like he purposely slouches so they touch? Haha. I know lame. 3. We have long converstations and we hit it off.. I think 4. whenever he passes the paper to me he holds it tight so I have to "struggle" to get them. Once again, lame. Back to the point, the girl that he was flirting with in the beginning shows a little interest in him too. He talks to her some too but we talk more. We both look alike so if he's attracted to one, most likely the other too. So I don't know what to do, we are both very alike. Do you think he likes me? Her? Suggestions of how to get him? Thanks a bunch.

I would like to make most of my senior year, at least the time that i have left in school. I would like to build a friendship with a particular girl in my school who isnt in my grade. But meeting new people scares me, especially when approaching a girl who is always with her girl friends. I'm , smart, with good grades and aspirations, but in terms of being more social, making new friend seems like a daunting task.

20081023105247AAbGVC7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should i do? I need your advice!?	I am an over achiever this year (my first year of high school), but my past in middle school i was the complete opposite, a downfall to the family name. However, i have all straight A's except for one class where i am uncertain of my grade. But today, i decided not to go to school because my essay report was due and i haven't got it finished. I admit I am afraid of the consequences and this is all my fault, but I mean, I'll have it done by today and present myself at school tomorrow and turn that instigating paper in. However, My parents woke me up today, and I didn't lie and say something like "oh I'm sick", because i know very well that would've led to a web of more lies. So stupid I, told them I haven't got my homework finished and my parents went ballistic. They told me my old habbit of being a careless student was back and that I was just like my cousin, (who is failing high school).     I do not want my parents to think of me as this way because they are fully focused on my getting a scholarship, so when they get back, what should I do? What should I say? Please help +++++
20090306231728AAOZxjl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are gentlemen still appreciated?	Alright, i am 15 and i consider myself a gentlemen. I am on the short side, 5 2 only, and i realize that most short guys are snobby and thats why they have all these women problems. Anyway, I am always that guy to compliment the random girl in my classes, even if they look bad, if they drop something i will pick it up for them, i talk with them, listen to their problems and help them out as much as possible and try to make them feel good about themselves. I mean besides being short im a good looking kid, im smart, im athletic, and i try to be the best i can be to women. I always open doors, and actually pay attention to what their saying, but it seems like all they do is picture me as a friend and not a guy who can have a girlfriend, and its starting to annoy me. Do i need to be a complete a** hole in todays world to get a girl, should i change? Or is being a gentlemen still good?

He is super smart, loves basketball & running (like me!), is involved in many school activites, loves to read read read and is 100% single!!!   i like Ricky a lot and have been crushing on him for about 4 months now. I heard a few of his friends talking and heard one mention that he liked me. Plus everytime he sees me, he blushes!       well i had a bf last year (Wally) and we stopped talking. I just got over our breakup a few months ago. I began to really "dislike" him (hate would be too strong...) and ive been doing an awesome job of avoiding him.    well when we were dating, my fav featur was his hAiR...i loved his black hair! it was so cute! it was perfect timing for him to get a haircut right when i stopped liking him. well yesterday i was on myspace and my friend Tricia told me to check out his pics. So i did. and guess what. His beautiful black hair grew back and he styled it WAAAAAY hotter than b4. I couldnt resist...plus my friend Keilah (also family friend of Wally) told me Walter is constantly checking my profile and takes pictures of my profile pic with his phone to carry with him. idk if he still likes me.       im usually used to liking 2 guys or more at once, but it suddenly feels like crushing on Ricky and thinking about Wally's hotness at the same time is just way too much to handle... idk what to do!!!

20090307015059AAS97XE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a girl smile at a guy like this without even knowing him?	Alright, obviously I did not word my last question the right way and I guess it was too long.      Anyway, if you take a look at this smile:  http://www.starmagazine.com/media/Knifes...       Mainly the first one or March 26, my question is, why would a girl smile in such a way at a guy that just passes her in the hallway or something?      I mean, normally all I ever see is small smiles but occasionally I get huge smiles like the image from girls that I just walk by or look at for a second.      I'm figure it means they are happy or something, obviously, but I myself never smiled that big at a stranger so I can't exactly see what it means. Plus, guys I talk to claim they never get that.

NOTHING satisfies them,I take really EXCELLENT marks when it comes to tests and they think it's not enough and I don't study well though I DO!   And when I clean it's always not good enough and they go calling me "odd" and "stupid/dumb" and "I've never saw any girl like you" and my mum opens the "when I was young I used to clean the house on my own" speech.   And they just piss me off when they start saying they're going to put a password for the computer because they keep nagging me to get off of it.   I beg 645737 times so I can hang out with my bestie or my friends!   And my b.f.f comes to my house they'll be like "why did you bring her?" I mean she's my b.f.f for heaven's sake !!   I swear I cried my heart out to play drums because they thought it's only for "boys" and they worried about what people will think,right now after 5 months learning drums they refuse to buy me one!UNFAIR!      And my mum doesn't allow me to eat that much especially chocolate! because she says that "Chocolate makes you fat" and I'm not fat it's not like if I ate some chocolate I'll get fat all of a sudden!

20081027114427AAIjfpV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! I feel like I'm ruining his life!?	I have been friends with my best guy friend Rory for three years now. The thing is though, he has been 'in love with me' for 2 years and 9 months.   Despite being very very close, I have only platonic and brotherly feelings for him, and have stressed these on many occasions. So have all of our friends.    But I feel like I'm ruining his life. He often seems upset and depressed, and even though many girls have expressed an interest in him, they never get very far because he says he 'only likes me'! Even though I always encourage these relationships.      I don't know what more I can do, and Ive tried staying away from him but its near impossible because we are in a very close group and we do EVERYTHING together.       He often 'tries it on with me' by feeling me up and stuff when he's had a bit to drink and it makes me very very very uncomfortable.       He's such a sweet, sensitive, kind guy and I feel so guilty.   What can I do????

20090306220451AAbnzfo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't understand him...?	I've been like crazy for him for years, but not in a vulgar way. I just kept it a secret. ? I don’t know if he likes me, but before we were close, now not much. And his other friends, before, also says he likes me but not that much. Just last year I started liking somebody else but I still do lyk him. Then just this January, I started liking his friend. I totally didn’t like him then. But now he’s beginning to flirt with me again. I don’t know if that’s considered flirting but he continues on forcing my seatmates to go to other seat for him to sit beside me. Then he starts talking to me about nonsense things and gets to notice everything i do and say. And he keeps on telling me that I really lyk him if i tell no, he’d say “u don’t lyk me, u luv me.” And i really am irritated by that. Even if i tell him that i lyk his friend to make him stay away from me, he’d still insist that i lyk him.    What do you think about that? Does he lyk me or what?

We had a really good time (I think) We are both really shy but we talked the whole date (Like I already knew him) and talk some more in the car before we went home. We have A lot in common and he said he will call me to come over and hang out and watch movies. Mind you im 30 hes 28 and we both are tired of the "bar" scene and want someone real. He gave me a hug and I texted him when I got home and he did text back. I think we hit it off but Im always second guessing myself. I REALLY like this guy, How long should I wait to call him (if he don't call me first?) God all mighty I feel like a 16 year old (Its been a while since I hav actually had an OFFICIAL DATE) Im not afraid of rejection but there is something about this guy........I just don't want to mess it up. Im a pieces hes a virgo but we seem to mesh perfectly !!! I don't know if I am jumping the gun on this, but I don't wanna push him away.

20090306225237AA2WxO3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know if someone is addicted to porno?	My guy spends at least 12 to 25 hours a week looking at porn on the internet. A few times he has lost track of time and was late for work. He is very defensive when I bring up the fact that I feel it's too much and maybe he has a problem.  I am pretty and sexy and enjoy sex a little too much. He turns down my advances a lot. He goes to really strange sites like barn that shows women getting it on with animals. He also likes all the barely legal sites. He's 55 and shy in bed and he acts like he's ashamed or embarrassed afterwords. We have been together for 9 years. I try to show him and talk to him about what a natural thing it is for 2 people in love to share. He's slowly getting a little better about it but I have been at this for 9 years with little improvement. Do you think all the porn is effecting how he seems to think we're doing something dirty? What would you do about him watching so much porn? Is it or can it be an addiction? Do most guys view this much porn?

So at lunch he would usually come over but sit next to me instead of her. Me and him talked and laughed and i started to developed a crush. One day he asked me to come talk to him over at his table and he said he might dump my friend. I tell my friend and she gets pissed and avoids him for the rest of the day. I really didnt want to sound self-fish but i really want them to stay friends cause that way i could have a chance to go out with him without my friend rejecting. I want to tell my friend but not right now cause im afraid she still a little to mad. I really like this guy but im not sure if he likes me back. its a huge tangled mess and i don't know what to do. help?!
20090306233842AAongsZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did he just stop calling?	I know that I am not the first person to ask this question, but I really feel like I need some clarification.    I am 23 and in college and I had been dating a guy for about 6 months. It started off really well... He would take me out on real dates, to dinner and the movies, etc. We had great conversations. He would call me about every other day and would tell me that he really liked me.   We had a strong physical attraction, although we had not had sex, he knows I am a virgin and although I made it clear I was not waiting for marriage, I did feel the need to be in a committed relationship before having sex.   Anyway everything was going fine, or so I thought. One of the last things he said to me was that he couldn't wait to see me.   That was the last I ever heard from him. I tried calling him 2 different times. He didn't pick up and never called me back. I made a conscious decision not to initiate further contact and it's become clear that he has no intention of ever calling me again.   What I really want to know is how could he do a complete 180 in terms of his feelings for me seemingly overnight?   Were all those things he told me just a lie?   Was it just about sex and he got tired of waiting for it?   Why couldn't he at least call and let me know that he didn't want to see me anymore?    Was it my fault?   How could he be so insensitive and cowardly to just leave me guessing?
20090306231220AADB6Zy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i tell my girlfriend im a virgin?	okay me and my girlfriend are 16 years old and im a virgin. i don't know if she is a virgin, sometimes i think she is but sometimes i think she's not.  i just don't know if i should tell her because for some reason i hope that she is a virgin and if not im okay with that i just don't want her thinking that it's all i want in this relationship cause i really don't i love her with all my heart but she told me once that if we do go all the way she doesn't want that to be all i think about which it wont be cause that isn't what i want from her i just want to show my love for her.  but i really want to have sex with her but i don't want her thinking that's all i want. im a little confused and for some reason im kinda scared to talk to her about it. i don't know why cause we talk about everything but i really just don't know what to do.  any advice would be nice. i want to talk it out with her but how do i get to that point?  im just kinda confused and need a little help.
20090307014759AAGEOrV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he so different to me?	I am close to his guy and knows every detail of his life though at some point hes still not letting me know or having me joined with his past "girl friend" - hookups whenever there is a beer session or night outs. Also, he's kinda hesitant joking about sex in front of me, but she is very open saying those things to my other girlfriends.
20090307015814AAdLMhc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm having relationship problems?	I am in a relationship with a girl that I love with all of my heart. We've planned the future out for the both of us. I'm only 16 and she's only 17, but we've both agreed that as long as we stay together, we're going to hope for the best and make the goals that we hope to accomplish.  But there's a lot of problems that I just don't know if I can deal with anymore.  I feel like she's changing me.  Before, I used to be a free spirited kid who just loved to have fun, but I feel like now that I'm just a conformist d-i-c-k who doesn't understand the true meaning of youth anymore.  I mean I even did something that I NEVER imagined that I'd ever do: I cut my long hair off. I've been telling myself that I did it for me and only me, but she pushed me to do it so much that I gave in. I might grow it back, but it's hard to tell.  I gave up my best friend for my girlfriend, because apparently she thinks that my best friend pushed me around and took advantage of me.  Plus, my girlfriend is overly jealous.  She always treats me good, but there are times where there is something right in front of her and she makes me pick it up or deal with it.  She get's so *********-y at times. Something will p-i-s-s her off, and she'll take it out on me and call me annoying.  I try to accept the world for it's true beauty, and she doesn't take that seriously when I try to.Even when I tell her that I'm a hippie at heart, she always says "no you're not a f-u-c-k-i-n-g hippie you idiot." I always have to give up my friends for her (not as bad as the best friend thing) to spend time with her, even if I already have plans with them or she gets really mad and plays the whole "I guess friends come first with you" card. Believe me, I love spending time with this girl. I love so many things about her, but it's getting ridiculous. I've been waking up in the middle of the night just in total dismay because I miss my best friend, and I miss who I used to be. Sometimes I wake up wanting the old me back, and I just think of all of the things I could do to end it, and all of the pros and cons of ending it. But I just can't. I love her so much.... Sometimes though I feel like it's the only thing I can do. She's controlling my life! She's always up my a-s-s, and sometimes I think it might be best to end it.  I just really need help with this one. Should I end it? should I not? If I should, what should I do to end it? Just keep in mind one thing: although I've said many bad things about her, just remember all of the positive things too. Please don't give me just one sided shallow answers like "break up with her." Please really think what you would do if you were in my situation. I'm a wreck people.

Do you have any experience on what guys do when they like you?   Or if you're a guy, what did you do when you liked a girl?   Like, subtle flirting or whatever.   No rude comments though.   Thank-you!   xx

20090307004948AAtnCup	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Doubting my relationship...?	Okay I recently broke up, with my ex of 5 years okay I really was in love with this guy, but we eventually just had a falling out and I made up my mind that I would always always be his best friend no matter what,  but then came along this other guy but I was still in pain from my break up, so he knew then but yet he kept on insisting that we hook up or at least hang out I had known this guy for like maybe 4 months, well right before new years I decided to give him a chance you know just friendly but it ended up being more and I was really getting into this guy he knows how to be a man and hold his place as one and I appreciate that,  well he is from a different country and he will be leaving soon to another state but he says he will come back,  well the point of this is in the begging he seemed so into me calling, being good to me, wanting to hang out, you know the normal.  He is still good to me but sometimes I just feel as if we are so much apart and sometimes I feel great but lately he just doesnt seem to want to spend to much time with me and he doesnt call as much,  I know this is signs its time to move on but I have tried but he just says okay what ever you say mam,  and kisses me or whatever I just dont know.  I called him tonight and well he was at a party so i said okay,  i called 3 hours later because i had just left where i was going and wanted to say goodnite.  well i talked to him and he said i was crazy becuz i wanted him to come out and drive around with me for a minute.  I just dont know if he likes me or he just likes to play around.
20090307043910AAoIuv6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys - lack of sexual experience?	I'm 25 and have only had sex with one guy, my last boyfriend with whom I lost my virginity (at 24). Unfortunately, even though he was a lovely guy in other ways, I found sex with him was not a very positive experience. He had a very high sex drive and was very pushy about wanting it all the time. Despite trying to talk to him about it and try to get him to slow down, in bed he was really impatient, too fast-paced and quite rough, and by his own admission he found it difficult to be gentle. Sex was almost always painful and unpleasant for me.        Anyways, we broke up a few months ago for other reasons, and in hindsight I wish I had never slept with him, but it can't be undone now.       I just feel that when the next guy comes along, and we eventually sleep together, even though I'm 25, I'm going to be very nervous after this. Also I just don't know what I'm doing and I feel really  embarassed about that.      How much do guys care about a girl's sexual experience (or lack thereof rather)? Also, was this experience typical - do many guys find it hard to be slow and gentle?        I really would like to have a healthy and positive sex life with my next partner, that is good for both of us, so any advice on this is much appreciated.      Thanks :)

20090306224240AAjHeab	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about my relationship?	I've been paranoid about my boyfriend cheating on me ever since a few months ago I looked at the computer screen when his messenger was open and I saw *sprawls out on the couch* as the first line. He noticed me behind him and closed it quickly; He still closes windows quickly to this day. He told me before we got together hes had many online relationships, and he has cyber'd (like phone sex but through the internet) with women, and role played. Anyways, being played by a couple other fellas, I got really pissed off and confronted him on it. He said he had no idea what I was talking about and the reason why he closes his messages so quickly was because his dad use to look over his shoulder all the time so it became habit. Now in explaining this he seemed panicked. I know this is like an obvious 'dump him!' moment but like...he says that he loves me with all of his heart, and always acts like I'm his forever and ever...I dunno, its a pain to accuse someone like this because he plays it off well if hes playing at all.   And a person can get paranoid about stuff, ESPECIALLY when your boyfriend says he wouldn't show you his messages because he wouldn't ask the same from me. He may have trust in me, but I'm still questioning his honesty, and doubting him more and more. And I told him this and he will not give me what I've been in need of. Reassurance.    Anyways, I dunno what to do, maybe this isn't the best place to ask, but a little reassurance and help is something I need right now because I'm not gonna get it from my boyfriend which is unfortunate. I'd hate to end the relationship with how far we've come the past 6 months, but I wanna do whats best for myself.

20090307050001AAdpVj7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he in love or is he in love with control?	My cousin is having a hard time with her boyfriend, they are expecting a child in about two months, his first, her second. They have known each other almost four yrs and have dated seriously for well over a year. Things seemed to be perfect, she was on cloud nine with him. He seemed to make her happy. They moved in with each other for about 3 mons with her 3yr old daughter. She said they had a wonderful time together, had the occasional fight, and she fell more in love with him. It was until he got drunk one night(her daughter was with her father that weekend)when they got into an argument over sumtin stupid and it ended up get a little physical and he pushed her out of the house. (he didnt beat her just pushed her around) Her mom picked her up that night and the next day they went to pick up all her stuff. She moved back home. He was very upset when she came to pick up her stuff she could see it in his eyes. She visited him a few times after the move to talk to him in person about what happen and well of course he begged her to come back. She wanted a life with him she did everything she could to make him happy when she was there and all he did was complain and make acusations. But now that she is pregnant they have tried to make a mends between each other and she found it in her heart to forgive him and now they are back to dating somewhat. Going out, going to the doctor together, staying with him when her daughter is with her dad, talking on the phone and so on, just like before they moved in. He has really tried to prove to her that he really does love her and he figured it out when she left him. Now all he wants is a family and she really wants that to. So for the past 5 mons they have tried to make things work. He swore to her he would never drink if she came back that he wouldnt be so insecure and controling. But she is still kind of hesitant about his feelings towards her. He hasnt been exactlly sober since that fight and well she thinks if he cant prove to her and to himselft that he can be sober before she moves in that he wont be able to when she is there. The baby has really brought out a side of him that she had never seen before and she feels he really wants to change and be a family. She wanted to try and fix up the house they were living in by putting new carpet and painting before baby cums. He was all on board with doing so, he pulled up the old carpent and fixed some of the floor that was damaged. But he has in his mind that she isnt going back even though she has helped with money to help fix the house. He feels like her and her daughter can just move in and be together until carpet gets put in but she wants the house done so that her daughter isnt living in a house that has exposed old wood floor and rooms are being worked on and so on. All she wants is to make a new home for her kids and she had hoped he would want that to but its all about him again. He wants what he wants and if she doesnt do what he wants "she dont love him". I dont know he can be a really sweet loving guy when he wants to be and a total *** other times. I told her that he probably loves you and just hasnt been in love to know how to manage his feelings. He seems to really want to change his ways and be dad and loving bf but he still has his hissy fits when things dont go his way and he threatens her that she is going to lose him. Is it wrong for her to feel he needs to prove to her that he isnt this selfish bastard and do sumtin out of character to prove he loves her? So does he love her or does he just love controling her?
20090307011259AAFj6nV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've told him that I like him.?	We are friend and the last time we met, he talk about his ex and his gf. (I never know he has gf.) I jealous and try to make it clear. So, I ask him why he talk about his ex and his gf. He told it's me who think too much. He think I'm just only a friend. So, I design to tell him that I like him. And I really afraid of rejection, afraid everything would not be the same.

20090307014017AApXxPG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or not?	theres this guy in my class. at the beginning of the year, when i was new, there was a rumor that he was going to ask me out, but many girls and guys alike warned me that he was a tease, a flirt and a player. i turned him down. i cant tell you how much i regretted it. after i started making new friends, they told me that he was a tease, a flirt, and a player for a reason. because his ex girlfriend two timed him for a lesbian. and i just smashed on his heart and crashed his ego once again, cause he is hot and very popular. after that he started flirting more, teasing more, especially me, trashing me, and just being a jerk. then after a while, he tamed a bit when i showed him my soft side, cause im pretty much edgy and everything. i dated 2 of his best friends and during that time, he seemed a bit jealous. he would ask my friends all about me and my relationships and such. and now, he almost completely stopped flirting with girls. i always catch him giving me a sideways glance, he seems speechless everytime i talk to him, when smile or laugh at his jokes he stops laughing and just looks into my eyes (xD) and he always tries to embarass me and makes up excuses to talk to me. its like im the only girl he's nervous to talk to, and sometimes i wonder if he likes me. i used to have a crush on him after i realized what i did to him, but now, i dont see him in that way anymore. but something inside me wants to show him what love is and i want to give him what he deserves. ehh, idk. what do you think?

20081021105554AANpkO5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about my boyfriend?	Me and my boyfriend are going through a long distance relationship.    I live in California; he lives in Virginia.      We haven't been through anything bad, and we've been together for almost 8 months.      I've been living a normal life, and I manage to get outside. I haven't been cheating on him, or anything bad like that. But he tries to prevent himself from getting outside because he fears that he might accidentally cheat on me. So he doesn't go to local functions, shows, parties, and school dances.      I REALLY want him to get outside, and now he bought World of Warcraft to keep him busy inside. All he does now is talk to me on the phone and play World of Warcraft, and I don't want him to be that way until we could finally be closer.      What should I do about this? I don't wanna break up with him.      Should I take the risk of telling him to get out of the house and hang out with his friends?  (that's if he has any now...)   Or should I just leave him alone, so he could talk to me and play WoW?
20090307000714AA1M2Vz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there anything I can do to help my depressed boyfriend?	My boyfriend of 2 years is really depressed. He says he hates his job, feels like his parents don't want him at his house, he hates his body and thinks he is ugly, and he said he hates that we're fighting lately (mainly because I'm confused because he's so sad all the time and I take it personally). Anyways, he's a very attractive and smart guy, so I'm so frustrated because no matter how many times I tell him he is amazing, he doesn't believe it. He has opened up to me, which took work, that he was depressed and about what. He also told me he'd like if we just didn't talk about any of that stuff anymore. I asked him if he wanted space to think about his problems, but he says no, but when we're together, he's sullen and quiet. Although, he always wants to see me. Why? That irritates me and it's so hard to be supportive.....does he just want me to lay there with him and say nothing? What do I do?
20090307012133AAsZavf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesnt he like me to talk about other guys?	Ok, so I have been friends with this guy over a year now. In the past we tried dating but he was to afraid to commit so we both started dating other people. when we hangout which is a couple of times a week he wants me physically and then there's times he uses the excuse that sex will just complicate things. I like him very much and we decided to be just friends. Although he doesn't like me talking about my dates or other guys why? Not to make him jealous but he is one of my good friends. He can never give me an answer....

My ex husband keeps "my things before marriage" and "our things after marriage" and he never returns my things and doesn't want to separate our things for 3years. Divorce hasn't settled yet. He agreed to my list( he returns my things before marriage and some of our things after marriage) through both lawyers in 2007 but it was verbal.    Recently he told his lawyer that he wouldn't return anything to me at all and would give only $1000 even "our things after marriage"'a value is more than $10,000. Some of my things are mother's crafts and paintings and I want to keep them and she wants me to keep them. She is old and if she dies, they become keepsake(momento) for me. I want him to rerutn things he agreed and share the value of "our things after marriage"( as money).  What action can I take?    Also when he sold our house, he didn't remove my gift - watertreatment(value of $800) - and sold a house. I was overseas and I agreed him to sell our house but he got Power of attorney, ignored me and sold our house by himself.  Can I claim of this $800?

20081015102829AArOnl7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I replaced my girlfriend's bikini pad with tortillas and she got mad at me?	ok, many days ago i went to a surf store, n bought a bikini. For my girlfriend. It was a padded bikini because my girlfriend is not too well endowed.      I went home n decided to gave it to her as a suprise n make her wear it to the beach as we planned an outing to the beach town on the weekend.      So on saturday, i took the bikini out. n i saw some plain tortillas which my mum bought in the kitchen. An idea struck me. I went to remove the foam padding cups in the bikini, and cut out some tortillas into round shapes (just like the padded cups) n put them in the bikini top's pouch.       So the bikini is now replaced by tortilla instead of foam padding cups! I laughed to myself, what a brilliant idea.       So i went to her place n showed her the bikini i bought, n she said it's lovely. She changed into it n wore a floral dress, n we drove to the beach town, an hour's drive. She didn't realize she had tortillas on her breasts!      We had lunch there n walked around the town shops before heading to the beach to suntan.      Just as we lay on the mat, i told her there's something in those bikini pads. She examined them n removed the pads, n was shocked to find out they were tortillas! I said lets eat them now!      She scolded me n threw the tortillas into my face, n threw a fit. Some people around us looked, n i keep apologizing. But then her facial expressions changed, she started laughing, n said she was just pretending to be angry, since its her turn now to prank me.      So later on we both had a big laugh, n she made me eat up all the bikini tortillas. They were still quite warm though. A bit sweaty though. oops.      ok girls so how would u react if u were in the shoes of my girlfriend?      
20081016105405AA4EC7l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I a looser for loving him?	I am best friends with a guy, and we get on great.   A few months ago, things got a little more cuddly.. it was good, until i asked him if he would EVER go out with me.. and i was rejected. simply because he didnt want to risk our friendship in case it didnt work out! so we left it at that and now were still friends.      I was with another guy.. more over the internet than anything else. my bestie, not the guy, told me that she thought he was kinda jealous of my new bf. and she said he told her it was his fault, that he lost me because he rejected me and he regrets it.      id broke up with my bf because it wasnt for me, and when my guy mate found out he was al "yay ur single"! now he is all cuddly again! he even lay on my bed with me and held my hand!   he has being telling me he loves me for a while now, but im getting mixed signals! he wont say i love you to my face! he kisses me (by msn) and says it through msn? im so confused.   i feel like im not good enough!

I met a guy a few months ago and we really hit it off.  Since then, we have had several dates and many conversations.  The other night he came over and we ended up fooling around.  I know the "rules" say you shouldn't call a guy the next day, but I'm old school and really don't follow the new "rules".  Needless to say, I haven't heard from him.  How do I know if this is a one night stand or not?  I like him and would like to see him again and I even told him that when I called the next day.  We are both in our 40's and I didn't think that people my age played those kinds of games, but maybe they do.  Please advise so I can be better prepared in the future.  Thanks.

20081117104752AA6WzBL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when your ex boyfriend still loves you?	Our break up was bad. He cheated on me with his ex who he had a hard time letting go of. I knew when we were dating he still had some feelings for her, he was honest about that. She tried every trick in the book (including sending me hate messages the whole time) and after we broke up they started dating again. She recently sent me an email telling me they were planning a future together and to stay away. I still love him very much and  think he loves me (believe me its not my ego talking). He called me the other day but sounds so sad and then said we should not stay in touch because it was "too difficult". How will I ever know for sure if he loves me  (what are the signs)? 
20090306165603AAEIxe5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Has there ever been someone in your life that you just really (I mean really) want to mess up?	Read whole thing.Okay. I used to be this guys friend. Actually this last summer. But while we were friends, he convinced my little brother to steal a bike from a public pool and he told him that he would fix it up and know one would know. But the owner found out and he convinced my little brother to take the rat for it and I let it go. I knew about the whole thing and I didn't prevent it and that's my wrong and I'm not proud of it. He also turned me against one of my best friends by lying about him to me while he was gone in El Paso. He's always thought he was cool and popular but 1.He's a total white trash punk and 2.His only friends are the loser skater kids. Imagine a skinny skater kid with short redish hair and big bug eyes that thinks he's funny when he acts like and *** hole. Nobody even laughs at his jokes and it's pathetic. But he always told me, "if you hang out with me, you'll be more popular". I didn't ever buy into that crap because everyone's always liked me. So one day we got in an argument. He's always thought that I should be his little posy and I should let him treat me like his b**ch. So I got tired of it and told him off and that I'm taking any of his crap. So he THINKS, he has a right to defend himself on that one and before I got the nerve to just deck him in the jaw, I decided to go check on my old friend that I talked about earlier. Turns out that I became friends with him again.  I haven't been the punks friend since then. But sometimes he'll talk with my little brother and tell him how much of a loser i am at school and that i don't talk to anybody. Which is bull because he sees me every day and he himself know that's not true. He's just a punk. He thinks hes the coolest kid in school but the only people he hangs out with are skater fags. And theyre not that popular. He's disrespected my whole family (including my mother), messed with our house, talks too much crap. He's not that normal person just have a little grudge on. I HATE everything about him. His face, his voice, his walk, his posture, and his personality. I've never been violent......ever. I've had urges toward some people but have never acted them out. But this guy just makes me want to break him. He still makes comments to my brother about me. It's just the fact that he has this little fantasy that I 'm such a loser and he's so much cooler than me. But what gets me the most is the enormous amount of disrespect towards my family. I'm just waiting for that time when he's on my property (I live in Texas. It's law that if you feel threatened, you can take action) and he decides to flap his jaw and say the wrong thing because I'm not kidding, he wont be able to talk out of that mouth again. I know I can take him. I'm buffed out and he's this skinny punk. I don't have a big ego just to let you know. I'm just comparing size and composition. Has anyone ever felt that way about someone. Should I wait for that moment?
20090306165903AAs34kw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Getting into a group.?	So my problem is that I went to my public high school in 9th grade and for 10th and 11th i went to private school. but for senior year i decided to go back to public because i hate private schools. and im basically caught between a rock and a hard place. after ninth grade i only kept in contact with my best friend but about a week before school started we had a huge falling out and so im effectively left to make new friends now. which is fine and i have friends. however the problem im faced with is that because people have formed such tight groups over the past 4 years its not easy to find a group to hang out with. I know like everyone but knowing everyone and being school friends is different than chilling on the weekend. To be honest i kinda have a group and we have hung out a few times. but its usually on a friday when im there with them to make plans. my question is how can i really get into my group of friends as something who is included in everything. it not that i have trouble making friends im just in a position where everyone already assumes i have a group of friends. obviousley i dont want to just go to my group and go ya i have no weekend friends at this school can i chill with you guy all the time. its not in my nature to act desperate. im in a good position how can i just improve my situation to really be part of the group? and plz dont say just try talking a lot and being nice cause we hang out at school all day and eat lunch together but i just cant get it to that more personal "hang out" level. thnx

Please Help Me!!!?	-One guy (Nick), I didn't even remember was my bf, he and I recently realized that we never broke up! But we have strong feelings for each other. We have been together for a year.   -The second guy (Adam), I am with because I was having relationship problems with the third guy, but I don't have very much feelings for him and he has strong feelings for me. We have been together for a week.   -The third guy (Peter), we have had some problems, he ignores me a lot and I think the only reason why I'm still with him is because he reminds me of my dad whom I barely ever see.

20090306225615AAZFvdI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to Find a Girlfriend?	Okay so I'm a guy in the engineering school of a college (right--somewhat geeky and nerdy).  I'm the person that everyone e-mails the night before an assignment is due because they know I've already done it and I'll help them understand it more than the TA.   Anyway, I've never had a girlfriend.  Sure, I have plenty of friends at college, but I'd like to be a bit closer to someone.  I guess my question is how to really find a girlfriend.  In all honesty, I wouldn't mind a girlfriend who was somewhat geeky like myself.  (I know many might consider me odd, but I'd be just as happy to do calculus with a girlfriend as I would going to the movies).  The thing is I have no clue how to find a girlfriend, or how to let it be known I'd like to be more than just a friend.  And hey--if it doesn't work, at least they will have gotten a few dinners.   So from the perspective of someone who is a girl or who has more experience than me, what am I doing wrong?  It seems like there should be a match somewhere on a campus with 30,000 students........
20090306230254AA2mSg3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys... If you were not at least somewhat interested in a girl you just met, would you hook up with her?	It's a question that's been bugging me and I'm not a guy, so I don't know. I met this guy through a friend at a house "get together" and when I first met him, he seemed normal. I introduced myself and vice versa and we kept getting eye contact a lot. Like he would look at me and smile. I would look but, in a "normal" manner. I nocticed him stare at me a bit when I would get up and like he was really cool and started playfully poking me in the stomach and stuff. Anwho, long story short. We decided to hang out afterwards and we hooked up. Now, we had been drinking a bit, but we weren't drunk. He was definitely not.    Would he have just hooked up to do it without having even at least a sexual interest in me?? Guys woud u just hook up to get some, no mattef what a girl looks like? I feel like he did. IDK?

I have mostly planned the wedding and paid for things, and am so exited, but I cannot be with him if he wont have kids.  I dont know what to do, stay and live on our normal lives forever, or leave and find something else, maybe better, maybe worse.  I am in total love with him, but I feel he lead me on for years and I dont think I can get over this.  Am I over-reacting?

20090307003817AA0Hhab	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested in me, is she scared?	Ok my supervisor and I are pretty good friends.  Everyone at work gets upset because he is always at my register talking to me and helping me transfer items.  We joke around at work, text just about everyday and see each other on campus and always goof off and help each other with anything we can.  He unfortunately has a girlfriend and they have been dating for a little over a year.  He has told his room mate (another supervisor) that he is not happy with her and would rather be with someone who takes care of him and has fun just hanging out.  The other supervisor "accidentally" told me about this.  Anyways, his girlfriend is always giving me the evil eye and tries to get him to stay next to her when I am at work.  She has gotten other people at work to try to keep him away from me and it's getting on my nerves.  He has mad little comments to me at work like we were talking about beating each other up and I told him he couldn't handle me and he winked at me and said he could in more than one way.  Or I wanted to work in the morning and he said he loved me and hurried to say he would love to have me in the morning.  He was handing me markers and I asked why he gave me certain colors and he said because he knows his favorite people.  Or he has gotten mad at another guy from work for making plans with me when he was having a party.   So back to my question is he interested in me and just can't bring himself to step up and leave his girl. Or am I reading to much into it.      And is she scared that I am going to take him from her or is she just immature and jealous

20090227130820AAh9cIx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to include hotel information for wedding?	My fiance and I are strongly considering switching to our " alternate Venue"      Our first choice is a beautiful museum but we can't access it till after 5pm and the food is $38 a person which ads up when you have 150 guests. We're finding more things wrong with it than good with it both budget wise and timing wise.       Our Alternate venue was is a hotel  not as stylish as the first venue but has many more perks: complementary  room for bride and groom,  complementary salon for bridal shower, if you have more than 126 people the room fee is waved,and they offer discounted rooms for our guests. Best of all we can decorate the night before as long as there is no bookings or get in the morning of.       I'm just wondering what is the best way to let our guests know that discounted rooms are available if they want them?

20090307041008AAmXCdO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am confused by this guy.... please help?	I really like this guy. We have kissed a couple of times and used to text/phone each other every day. He told me he liked me and he wanted me to realise how amazing I was etc. He also said comments like 'I wouldn't mind a girlfriend soon.' I wasn't possessive at all, and it was usually always him who contacted me first.   However, he recently had a chat with me to tell me that wanted some space. He did however still tell me that he liked me and that something may still happen in the future.   Now when I see him, he acts the same as he usually did and suggests nights out together etc. I'm unsure as to where i stand with him though. What would be the reasons for the space he wants? Am I expected to sit around and wait for him to decide when he wants to be with me, or am I meant to move on?   Thanks for any help in advance
20090227130923AAbZ0jf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think I'm just misjudging?	there's a guy at school (college that is), and he always says hello to me. i was really down and upset yesterday about something, and he could tell. so he talked to me about what was wrong and said that he felt bad for me, and that i could talk to him anytime and gave me his number. well later that evening, he called me, because i had text messaged him earlier, therefore, he had my number. after speaking to him a bit, i asked him why he wasn't married, and he said that he was, and that i must have missed the part where he said he was married and had been cheated on. to make a long story short, he offered to take me to the movies and dinner and whatnot, and he told me how attracted to me he is. i told him i thought that was very inappropriate (not to mention i'm not attracted to him), and that i didn't want to hang out with him, and then he said that he was just trying to help to get me away from studying for a while. do you think i'm wrong for not taking him up on his offer? i mean, i was really down and upset about something, and maybe he really was trying to help.
20090307040025AAyucyU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do with him now?	My boyfriend broke up with me over a text message. I found out he was tripping on "shrooms" and it upset me because we had a talk about him not doing them. When I found out I hung up on him and 2 hours later I get the break up text. He called me 2 hours after that apologizing and saying he didnt mean it and it's just a bad trip. I was as nice to him as I could be because I didn't want him freaking out and hurting himself because those types of drugs can make you act out of the ordinary. I told him it was ok and I still love him and all that to keep him from going deeper in the depression hole. The thing now is I was only telling him this to help him come back to a happy state of mind but I dont want to be with him anymore, what should I do?
20090307051834AAnCxN2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why Are My Friends' Snobby?	so my friends and I known each other since high school. most of them are successful people (doctor, lawyer, nurse, research analyst, legal secretary, manager, etc). we meet each other for lunch every about once a week. they put me down alot because I clean people's houses for extra money or they make jokes about me and my job. they treat me as if I'm beneath them cuz they make more money than me. my job doesn't define who I am and I enjoy this because I get exercise too. i do this part time so I can stay home the rest of the time to take care of my kid and that way I don't spend a fortune on childcare. most of my friends have nannies/housekeepers or put their children in childcare full time cuz they work 60-80 hrs a week.       what do i say to my friends when they make unnecessary jokes about me and my job? i know you're gonna say to find a new set of friends but first I wanna know what to say to them and maybe they'll make an attitude adjustment.

I'll be getting married in a few years, but because my fiance and I are trying to have a simple (and frugal) wedding, I would like to use my engagement ring as my wedding ring.      The reasons are that I don't want any more diamonds on my left hand (my e-ring has one middle solitaire and smaller ones around), and because I love my e-ring and don't want to spend any more money on bands. So, does it look tacky, or is it acceptable? Thanks in advance. :)      Kelly

20090307024001AAArZFd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do guys only like these types of girls or...?	It annoys me so much. I meet these nice, respectable looking guys, and hope that maybe i might have a chance, until i find out they all want sex and my body. They don't even care about who i am, nor do they have any interest in getting to know me. I am shy and quiet but i love to meet new people, and i can be very outgoing and social. I dress well and i am not fat, nor am i very skinny. I am kind, and generous, and sometimes my friends think i am weird cuz i am not like them. Is it just me or do all guys like girls who are easy and dress like tarts, or are there more nice, respectable guys out there than there seems?

20090307032703AA1wRKH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OMG what would you guys do with him in this confusing situation?!?	So ages ago we used to really like each other but he didnt ask me out bcos he found it really hard that we go to different skls. then just before christmas i told him i didnt like him anymore and that we should be jst friends. Anyhooo in xmas i got over him and met this other guy who i really like. Then 5 days ago the guy i got over texted me and i was quite happy that he made the effort to be friends but as the convo went on i got a bit confused. I was telling him that i would be bored on the wkend and he replied saying 'I'm sure u'll find a way to entertain urself tomorrow. If not, just give me a buzz...and i'll try to keep u entertained xx'   a) is that flirty?   Next, i didnt call him but that night i replied saying 'Library was way too entertaining today, ur gonna have to call me later in the week...xx'      b) Its Friday, basically a week later and he hasnt called. Was my text really dismissive and his ego crushed by it? Or does he think i'm playing the game so he's really playing the game and making me wait??      Basc. he's really confused me about if i like him or not. Should i call him or just wait for him to decide wat to do??? If last time he thought we couldn't see each other enough, what's the difference this time?      ANYONE HELP!
20090307023419AAeN4TQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do???????	I've liked this guy now for over a year, we went to Japan together and with a school trip.

20090307021912AAjzg7Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I tell a secret I have from a friend?	So, about 10 years ago, my roommate was changing and I saw that her nipples had some hair on them.   I was not great friends with her, we just were in the same sorority.   So, I go and tell a friend of mine about this, and we start laughing and making fun.  Not nice thing to do, but yes, I did this.   So, then my friend, goes and tells the guy she's dating, who happens to be very popular and lusted over by most of us.. so, of course we were very jealous of her.. she was the 'good girl' going out with the 'bad boy'.. kind of like on Grease or something..   Anyways, so we have now rekindled our friendship, and start talking again on facebook, me and my roommate..   I have already apologized to her once, saying I was sorry for being pretty irresponsible and a partier, while she was a study nerd.    She said there was no reason to apologize.. but I feel still badly about it, and I always wondered maybe she found out about what we told this guy and I was so embarassed about it.   Should I confess to her?  or leave it alone.   She is now happily married with 2 kids, and the NEXT guy she went out with is her NOW husband.. and it's funny that this guy that dumped her right after he found out about her hairy nipples, is now married to another one of our sorority sisters.      What do you guys think?  a secret forever?  or tell her?   Thank you.

I'm a flirt and I've always made guy friends by breaking the ice by flirting, then just becoming normal friends.      but when it comes to girls I always get nervous especially if they're pretty [i have low self-esteem] and end up not saying much and becoming boring.      and i've noticed when i'm in a room full of kids by age, i pick out the girls and see who's pretty, then i just study them and pick out one girl and see how i could look like her and dress like her.      i'm a weirdo really.       i'm a girl, 15. what's wrong with me? like whenever a girl approaches me im just so happy to just be next to her i just go empty and not have anything to say, eventually she walks away and i feel so stupid that i just run off to boys and joke around immaturely.      and when i DO talk i always end up just complimenting them, like wayy too much and it just freaks them out.

20090307044224AACea3W	Family & Relationships;Friends	My Friend Always Puts Me Down!?!?! Makeup / Hair / The Way I Look!??!?!?	Heyy. THis girl who i'm close friends with is quite loud ish now, and she thinks she's amazing. She puts me down though!   When I get stares from guys, she doesn't point it out to me, and pretends it doesn't happen... just because she doesn't get as many stares.    When I have a little too much mascara on, she will point it out and be like "omg how much do you have on... why don't you just wear none?" and she'll 'joke' with me that I'm caked in makeup... even though I don't wear that much.   She will always stare at my face in lessons when she's next to me, makeing me self-concious... she just looks for the little flaws. And I know what she's doing.   She never pays me a sincere compliment, and I always give her them.   IDK, maybe that's the kind of perosn she is, I mean I don't notice her giving her other friends compliments either, but she certainly doesn't tell them they're makeup and hair looks ridiculous!   Arghh I don't know what to do... I feel a bit self concious round her. She is louder than me by nature, and if I did give a comment like that to her, she would probably bounce back quicker. But i don't. I'm always nice to her. Why is she like this to me? And how can I cope cause I can sense myself getting more worked up about it and it's affecting my confidence :(   Please help??? Thankyouuu x x
20090227131347AAFNGS8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy with a gf keep looking at another girl? (cover)?	Okay so there is this guy that goes to my school. He definitely has a girlfriend but for some reason I get the feeling that he's looking at me--actually I know that he's looking at me. When it first started I thought that I was just over my head, cause I mean why would a guy with a gf always look at the same girl? So I thought that maybe he wasn't looking at me.      But he does it a lot. And to no one else but me. So what's up??   He stares too...   Plus he sometimes walks by me and on his way back he looks at me. Why?? Like I really don't get it..

20090227130650AAXSeL6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Suggestions way to handle a past tragedy thats resurfacing?	Almost 6 years ago we lost a child at birth. He was not a planned child at the time but we were excited to have another baby. Our two other children are now 18 and 19 so was a 12 gap between the youngest and the one we lost. Now that the oldest is about to graduate this year and head off to college wife brings up that wish we had another child. Some might say then make another but that is impossible because about 2 years ago wife had to have full hysterectomy. We are both in our mid 40s and even I kind of miss the idea of havnig a child in the house. With the kids both either in or getting ready to head to college it has brought back up some of the emotions over the loss of the one 6 years ago add to that we can not have any more children its has caused some kind of pins and needles feelings at times. Any ideas on ways to help get over this hump of us becoming a empty nest and wifes feeling of missing have kids around the house. I have some of those same feelings but not even close to the intensity that she is having now.
20090307050330AAJxP5H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Brother vs. Boyfriend?	Where do i start...      My brother is almost 19   My boyfriend is 22   And I'm younger than both of them         My brother always comes in when we are watching tv, and is just plain RUDE! It pisses me off to no end!    Like yesterday, we were laying on the couch, 1/2 alseep, and he comes in and goes "thats gross, do you guys need a babysitter"   like...really? Grow up! AHH!   But he says stuff like that all the time   Only when he's home from college for a few days   But in 2 weeks, he gets a WHOLE week off.   I dont know =(    ...My bfs gonna kill him, literally. He got so mad yesterday when my brother was being a jerk, and left right after. He told me if i don't talk to him, he will, blah blah blah.      But my bigger problem is, if he talks to my brother, he's gonna loose it on him, and since my brother is "perfect" my rents will side with him, and i don't want him to ruin my relationship...It took FOREVER to convince my parents to let me date my bf [age difference issues]      What am i supposed to say to either of them?   My brother does it to piss us off.   And my bf's not a good choice to piss off.       My brother is so immature, i cant take it.    It's just so embarrassing.       I dont think i can talk to my parents   I've tried.   My mom says "he's just over protective"   and said "if there's and issue between them, you know who will win"   ...meaning my brother, because hes the "perfect child"      Its not like I'm his only sister, there's 5 of us.    2 other sisters, and a younger brother.          Ugh...Help?

20090307034523AA2RfLG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We're already have sex problems...?	... and we just got engaged!       *There's a bit too much info in here so don't read it if you don't want to!       My fiance and I started having sex a few months ago and he'd always try to stimulate my clit and it would hurt like hell! I thought I would get used to it and it would start feeling good like it's supposed to but it didn't. So finally I go to the gyn and she tells me that I don't have a clitoral hood and that it's very rare but it happens sometimes and that's why I'm so sensitive down there. I can't even touch mysef because it hurts, I'm that sensitive.. I feel like my fiance is unsatisfied because he can't get me to orgasm that way but when I ask him he says it's fine but I can tell he's not.I told him I was sorry but like I don't know I feel like he's still no OK with it... What should I do?
20090307031934AAQwcX0	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What to do about irritating in-laws in the run up to a wedding?	I am due to get married in September and me and my family have started to get really excited about it - buying things, planning, talking about it etc. but everytime I see my in-laws the only thing they ever discuss about the wedding is who we should invite that we haven't, or how they don't really like weddings.       My sister-in-law is trying to make us feel bad for not inviting her new step-daughter and step-grand-daughter... I have never had so much as a birthday/Christmas card from the step-daughter, so don't really see why I should pay out ￡50 a head for the 2 of them! We have offered to invite them to the evening, but that's not enough!      As for my father and mother in law, I just get the impression neither of them could really care less about the whole thing. My father in law has offered to give us some money towards the wedding which I agree is generous but all he has done is make a fuss about how my family should pay for the whole thing and how if his daughter was getting married, he would give her loads of money for it.      I just don't know what to do - I am getting really resentful towards them, and feel as though they are taking advantage of my family by expecting them to pay for the whole thing but can't say anything... What do you suggest?

My boyfriend and me live together and have 2 daughters but one is not his, theyre both fairly young. on friday night they were staying at their nans so we went out for a meal and i said when we got home we still had some drink at home (suggesting that we get drunk) because i havent had a drink in ages and i only really drink with him because of my daughters i dont get a chance to go drinking very often and he said he didnt really feel like it and wasnt in the mood and never is, if its just me and him on our own then for the night or the weekend then hes always really tired and goes to bed at around 11 or half 11, whereas if he was going out with his friends hed be in bed at 4 in the morning. he says that its working all week makes him tired but like i said hes only tired if hes with me.   so on saturday the kids still werent back and i asked him what we were going to do tonight and he said did i wanna go for a meal down a local pub-turned-restaurant place but he was tired so did i mind if we didnt drink tonight either and i said alright then but then we had an argument and he ended up going out with his friends and i stayed at home on my own then he came back at half five the next morning very very drunk its starting to drive me crazy!

Me, my brother, and his friend, are nearly the only people in our town that like hockey. And we love to play it (and basketball) on our driveways. It's cold, but the pavement is dry, and it's good to play in.      However, my sister has friends over all the time (and we do have school off today) to watch Bones and House, and all of this on TV. Yeah, sounds fun.......      We have a bunch of construction of millionaire houses across the street, and cars are parked up and down. Then, her friends, who all drive, take up our driveway, and there really isn't another place to park. We just want to play on the driveway, but it happens all the time when there is very little room, and we can't do anything.      What can we do to fix this? I know this is a dumb question (you don't have to tell me), but do you find any somutions to this? We just want to play!

20090307034056AASwc1H	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister and her two rowdy sons want to stay with me and my family but her son's are uncontrolled?	My sister is 23 and has an eight year old and six year old and they are uncontrolled and rowdy. The thing is last time they stayed over they were both running around the living room, screaming and throwing things about whilst mine and my fiancee's daughter was in the room - she was three months old at the time - she was in her car seat near the sofa whilst my fiancee went to grab her keys off the table in the hall. The two boys nearly knocked over the car seat much to the horror of my fiancee. In the car if our daughter cried the six year old would try and hold her nose. My sister isn't the cleanest of people either. She stayed over for a month whilst my fiancee was pregnant and she left her clothes everywhere, takeaway boxes everywhere and the guest room was a disgusting mess.   My sister is homeless again, she can't afford the rent on her flat and she's disowned our parents

20090307050727AAZmDsm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Major Friend Dilemma :(?	These 2 girls who were like my best friends totally fell out with me a while ago, I sent a text to my boyfriend (one of their brothers) messing about and they took it seriously. When I found out they had and they were ignoring me, I took the totally wrong approach and ignored them completely back. There's been lots of bitching and stuff in between, but not to each others faces, until yesterday. My current best friend said "lets go and sit over there" because that's where everyone was, including one of the girls. As we were walking towards them she said to me "don't start anything" which i hadn't but then when we were sitting down she said to the girl "don't mind nob head here shes only a tag along." That made the girl think she could start saying stuff about me and so i bickered back then my best friend said that were both included in her best friends and she doesn't want us fighting. What the hell?! I feel really messed up now about all my friends and really need a way to get out of this =/ To make it worse, later that night I asked my so called best friend what she thinks about making up with the two girls, she replied that they wont want to be friends with me even if I say sorry =/ HELP!?!?!?!

Like she goes do you have a boyfriend yet I go no [were in 7th grade by the way] and then she laughs at me like im too ugly to get a guy or something. then one day we were talking and she goes I wear an small in hollister and she goes what do you wear and i said medium because i didnt want it tobe too tight because it will shrink in the wash, and she started laughing.To be worse at school Im friends with somebody but everytime the preps are around she goes and talks to them instead of me. then at the beginning of the year I was best friends with someone else but then she laft me for some other girl and now shes best friends with her.Sooo what do I do?

20090227131210AAtnj8b	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How can we add remembrance of our fathers at our wedding who have both passed away?

I'm not having anyone to walk me down the aisle but we would like to have some kind of remembrance to say they are still there celebrating with us.
20090307031010AAt2UOq	Family & Relationships;Family	How to tell off an Abusive Mother?	I am the eldest of four siblings, two of us have different dads, we are always being singled out, and both of us are girls. I'm starting to hate my mother. Ever since I can remember my mother has been abusive both physically and mentally. Always calling us stupid, hitting us, telling us we are nothing. Fortunately for me I'm able to get up and leave whenever I want to, but my younger sibling can't and I don't have the money to support her. However, she is still being mistreated to the point that my sister has rebelled and starts to fight back with words and physically as well. My mother is a lazy woman, she tells my step dad that she is not his slave, he is a doctor works over 60 hrs a week, doesn't really have a day off and my mom doesn't cook for him and she still wants for him to take care of my brothers and do stuff around the house. We are all tired of her crap. My siblings get in trouble because the house is a mess, yet she doesn't clean the house at all. She is constantly picking fights with everyone, literally. She humiliates us in front of others, mostly because she yells at us in front of others. She has made my life a living hell. The other day I asked my mother what grade she would give herself as a parent from 1-10, 10 being the best, and she said an 8. I couldn't believe it, I asked why and she said because she took good care of me when I was an infant. Seriously, I was baffled. All my memories have been of abuse mostly physically. She would hit me with cables, shoes, anything she could get a hand on. And although she doesn't use those kind of things on my other siblings she still hits them with her fists, but one thing that bothered me was that she told my sister was that my sister had to respect her no matter what because she was the parent whether she liked it or not. My mom thinks she is the queen of the house and we have to do what she says because we should be grateful we have a roof over our head, yet our stepfather doesn't asks us for anything in return. How can you tell your mother her truths without feeling guilty? I'm just done with her, nobody wants to stand up to her not even my step dad. I know he is also fed up with her crap, but how much more can someone take from her and not tell her off. My sister tells her off but i don't have the courage to tell her, i must confess i'm still scared of her. How can you make her see she is wrong?

20090307035150AABhVj7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship problem...?	I recently had a problem (her drifting away from me) with my best friend which caused me to be depressed. After some things happened we fixed it by talking to a counselor along with our group of friends. She said sorry for not noticing her wrongs, that she just had a big problem and that she took me for granted. She also told me that she wanted us to be friends again, so i felt really glad. So now we are fine.      The problem is now when I'm with her i feel kind of awkward. Last time when we were online in ym it felt hard for me to just go and buzz her and talk about casual stuff like we did before. It also bothers me that even though we are online for quite a long time now she doesn't do the 1st step to buzz me and start a conversation. Is that maybe because she is also shy because of what happened recently? I am also afraid if i always be the 1st one to start a conversation she might get irritated or disturbed. I don't know what to think, but i want our friendship to be like before.

Really when the intent is to not have sex and to hang out and get quality time with eachother. Being as I'm always grounded for like everything it's sometimes difficult to see him on the weekends.

He said he wants me to be his best friend, even before his guy best friend!  Is this a good thing? I'm worried it sounds like he's rather be friends than together.      What do you think?

20090307055937AA6jUc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She's rejected me several times, would this time be different?	I am sorry it's an essay, but I think the details are important.  I met her about 6 months ago.  We got close.  She models, traveling 2-3 days a week.  But spends a lot of time with me (a lot of dinners) when she's here.  Then I told her how I felt.  She said there's no future because of our different religions.  I told her we should distance ourselves, and although we left the restaurant together, she was crying.        Her friend called me and told me she had been crying for days, so I called and said we could try being friends.  Well being friends doesn't work.  We've had 3 breaks from being "friends".  The last one she wanted a 2 week break.  Saying, she's so overwhelmed with our friendship.  That she thinks we should only hang out in groups (we have no mutual friends), and not do anything personal for each other anymore.      So our break ends, and we got close again.  Now every other night she crawls into bed, and we talk for hours on the phone before she falls asleep.  Before she left for NYC this weekend.  She asked if I wanted to come with her to a religious event of hers.  I told her yes, but I am Christian, and not looking to convert.  She said she's not asking me to, she just wants me more involved in her life.  She was really happy I said yes.  After that, she asked if I wanted to get dinner on Tuesday, and watch a movie on Monday.  I said sure, even though the only time I asked her to the movies, she told me "no" because she hated movies and always fell asleep.  Yesterday I get the text "Hey my plane just landed.  I wanted to tell you that I am excited and looking forward to going to the movies on Monday!"      I really do care a lot about her.  I've tried dating other girls.  But it always comes back to her.  But I don't want to constantly go in the on/off relationship, it's not healthy.  She's rejected me so many times...am I crazy to think this time it might be different?

20090307072930AAMnFO9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Poll: If you ever get married, or decide to renew your vows, what song do you to hear at your wedding?	There's a smooth Jazz artist who goes by the name of Euge Groove.    http://www.eugegroove.com/main.htm   He's a sax player and there's this one song (no lyrics. Just straight instrumental) called "Slow Jam" off his "Born to Groove" CD.  Most of his stuff I consider "ok."  But "Slow Jam?"  Oh that's nice!  ( ^ _ ^ ) It's pretty laid back.  Kinda down tempo-ish.  Man I could slow drag to that all night!  It's pretty classy.  You would have to dress up for this song!  I'd give up my jeans, sneakers and hoodie for this song!  Straight tux with the lady wearing something stunning!  Yeah, it's that type of song. :)
20090307071227AAb4juY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What does it mean when a woman says this?	"I think like a man, when it comes to dating". What do she mean? Would that scare you if a woman your interested said that to you? Why or why not?         I put it in this section instead of "Dating" for better insight.
20090307061240AAraFBu	Family & Relationships;Family	My Dad smokes and doesn't know I know.?	When I was 6 or 7 I caught my dad smoking but it has been 7 or 8 years now and he still doesn't know I know.   I'm scared to tell him because I don't know how he would react.   I try to get him to stop in way apart from telling him,      Like I make Jokes that hes breath smells like smoke *which it does but I turn it into a joke* I tell him his hair is falling out.      But it doesn't work.   A few months ago when I was home alone I found some of his cigarettes on the fridge and threw them out.   I have found nicerete patches so I know he's trying but its not working.      When ever an ad comes on for quit lines and all I mention that smokers are people who must have no lives (its not always true I'm just letting him know that smoking is wrong)   and he agrees with me but in a way as to let me know he doesn't want to talk about it.      The only person I have told about his smoking is my friend who occasionaly tries to scare him out of it with me.      I know, I know I can't just *scare* him out of smoking. But maybe put more time in trying to quit.      Since I am a Christian I believe Smoking is a deadly sin, and for all I know my dad could have cancer and he hasn't told me.   I'm not going to get into my religious views on this but all i'm saying is I believe smokers will go to hell.      I love my dad and I really want to be there for him and its not as easy as to just go up to him and tell him I know about him smoking, he will freak and probably won't talk to me in a normal way for at least a week.      I really need help, I can't even begin to discribe in human words how much this affects my life and thelove I have for my dad.      How can I help??? Without telling him I know if possible.

20090307071005AAOJmOP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you suspected your spouse was unfaithful, you busted him by an accidental cell phone call and confront him.?	then when confronted he refuses to tell you who it is.  Divorce was filed before being busted.  He had been staying out really late and going to the bar alot after work, always going to the neighbors to drink, avoiding me and being mean..  When I asked how could you take a woman to our cabin?  You already filed, I hadn't been seeking other women.  But a week after you are served papers instead of wanting to make things right you still won't tell me who it is nd you protect her identity.  I don't think that there is any hope.  Actually I don't think I want to get lied to anymore, but we have children.  He did move some stuff out and has been staying with his mom.  What do you think???? Thank You for your feedback.  trying to make sense of it all.

20090307064912AA3xOMz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do people push religion and/or the Bible on people -- especially in regards to marriage?	Don't people realize that our country was founded on freedom of religion?      Whether or not someone is religious is SUPPOSED to be a personal choice, however I hear things like "It's against the law because the Bible says it's wrong."      If our country was founded on freedom of religion, then things shouldn't be against the law simply because the Bible says it's morally wrong.      To be honest, I'm just sick of the do-gooders who don't have the "live and let live" attitude.  Now, I'm all for laws that are there for a reason and are in place because they effect other people, however things like gay marriage and polygamy do not affect anyone but the people who are involved in the relationship, so why should they be against the law?      And why won't some people stop pushing the Bible on others? Freedom of religion means they have a CHOICE whether or not they want to listen to what a book says.      I guess the bottom line is I'd like to ask.  Those of you who are religious, I can understand you having a MORAL issue with such things as gay marriage, and polygamy, even though I don't agree with you.  What I DON'T understand is why you think it should be against the law instead of just minding your own business?      (And I don't even want to hear anyone mention children as an excuse.  There is no evidence the being brought up in a polygamous or gay household has any negative effects on a child.  ALL children have things they have to deal with, teasing, etc.  It's a lame excuse and I don't want that cited.  Give me a REAL reason.)

We get on really well and had a laugh until I asked him if he had met anyone.  He said he has met someone really nice who is attractive, intelligent, has a lovely home and really makes him laugh.  Then he went quiet and said he shouldnt really be telling me all this.  He said we could still be friends and meet up for a drink or go out some time soon.  I was so stunned that I burst into tears.  He said he was really sorry and then I left it at that.      I feel really angry, bitter and resentful.  I really wanted things to work and now he has happily moved on and met someone else and tells me everything is great.  I just feel so low.  Please help, any advice would be really appreciated : (

20090307054541AAgL2EG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	She was the perfect wife and I wasn't so how come...?	My husband, my best friend and her husband all met in college and we've been friends ever since.    She's always been the "caregiver" type, yet now she's getting a divorce and that scares me. She's like the perfect wife, she wakes up every morning and makes the hubby a nice breakfast and then she makes all these elaborate dinners for him and does all the housework and as far as I know they had a good sex life. Me, eh I'm pretty useless. I don't make breakfast, we share the house work and dinner is usually pasta even though I have way more time. I get back home from work at 4 and I spend the time doing useless stuff like doing my nails and my exercise DVD. Now that they are getting a divorce I feel like I've been so much more of a "not as good" wife that how are we still together and they aren't? I mean, we're happy together, but I'd only imagine that her hubbz should be happier since she's done so much more for him and she follows all the rules like not having sex every single night or it'll get boring and stuff and for me I don't... the moment he gets home it's on..  I'm just..not as mature I guess? I don't know..
20090307063000AAoVRB3	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it just female jealousy?	I have been mates with 2 girls from school for many years now. We all got jobs as being brolly girls at British Superbike race meetings in the lower classes. It was amazing! Really fun, and we always had a laugh and was competitive with our teams, but we were all amazingly close mates.   I started dating one of the higher class riders around 7 months ago, and of course him and his team have asked me to brolly for him. I said yes of course. Now my mates seem to be ignoring me a little and making comments about me and my boyfriend. Things will still be the same, its just we all wont be brollying on the grid at the same time. Why are they acting like this? Its not much different, just my boyfriend is sitting on a bigger bike and that the fact is the rider i'm brollying for is my boyfriend! I'm confused :(

Have my husband wear a velvet suit, white shirt with ruffles, boots with high heels (hehehehehe), and a powdered wig.          My second wacky idea would be to get married in hawaii, by an elvis impersonator. Wearing very loud hawaiian shirts, khaki shorts, and flip flops.       My third and final idea would be to get married naked in a nudist colony.       Well those are my brilliant ideas. So share with me some of your wacky or funny ideas for a wedding.

So, everybody found out in school. I felt like a darn celebrity when their fans find out information about them. The whole school was talking about it.      I just couldn't believe it. We have advisory at our school. I ani't explaining what advisory is. I'm trying to make this long story short :)      && my real advisory teacher told me to come to class, my advisory class and I did.      That same girl that have a problem with me, she asked:   "I can't believe [name] went with her!"      && then some girl whom I thought was my friend. she asked:   "She left her for that?"      I don't know if it is suppose to be mean. But the ***** is phony.      So how do you handle a rumor that is true, and how do you handle your haters.      I mean I love them. They spot my every wrong. They update people about me. They're like my fans. :)      So please tell me what to do?

20090307055402AAfIHxO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Looking for a best friend?	Ok this might sound a little silly, but I miss having a BEST friend. Somone who you click with, who you can be yourself with, do new things with, act stupid, call first when something good/bad happens, go out men hunting with, chat/confide in and have them confide/chat with you. I just miss having a best friend. I had a best friend back in the day and no one knew us as just angela or paige we were always "anglea and Paige' we had sooo much fun all the time and really just were the best of friends. I ruined that relationship and wish I could take it back. Nothing terrible i didn't think, but we had another girl close to us who mentioned something to me and I mentioned somthing to her and she got mad, just stupid stuff, but I should of kept my mouth shut & she stopped being my friend after that. I miss her and miss having a friend like that. I have friends and go out , but nothing like a best friend. Has anyone else ever felt like this ???
20090307073138AAM7zV5	Family & Relationships;Family	My gf has a 6 year old girl, she does not do anything i ask?	We bought a house together 2 years ago. She spends 50% of time at dads and 50%here. I don't ask here to do anything unreasonable. Usually it is: pick up your clothes, put your plate in the sink, or don't get something out..these types of things.   she almost always just ignores me or goes to ask her mom if she has to do whatever i asked her to do. My gf says i need to be more assertive but when i am i feel more like i am yelling and being mean and then my gf says i am being a jerk. I don't know if I can handle living with a kid that doesn't respect me and her mom doesn't make her listen or respect me. Her mom is part of the problem since most of the time when her daughter comes to ask about something i told her she couldn't do her mom will yell from wherever she is something like "why can't she do that??!" or basically just undermine any authority i had. so while writing this i guess i realized this is probably more moms fault. Or should i not have this authority over her kid since i am not her dad?

20090307062756AAWVL6Q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How much for Child support?	I have a 34 month old daughter, after I got pregnant her father and I split, ok straight to the point, he is an asshole, he has only seen her 3 times, last time was oct 07 and he sends her $100 like every 3 months, sometimes is longer. The thing is I field for child support on feb 07 they send him a letter, he went there, I went there but it all stay in nothing. Every 6 months I have to go there so they can give me a letter saying that the ******* thing is in process, that's for my medical plan. The lady of the place always just give me the letter and that's it, but last time I went (Thursday) she was like, since 07 this thing is going on, and he has not come, what he thinks this is, and she gave some papers to proceed with the case. But I didn't have that in mind. Her father calls me, he doesn't ask about my daughter but he talks to me about his personal problems, and a week ago he called me to tell me that his dad died. He doesn't have any money and he has 3 more children. Only one of them is on the child support service.       The thing is since there is a new law in which in the paper you right down the amount you want to claim for child support, if the person doesn't do anything, doesn't call or go, that's the amount he will have to pay you. All this time I have been living with my parents, they help me and i'm 25. He is 29      The question is. How much should I ask for? How should I feel, I feel bad, when he gets the letter he will be like, what I'm going through and look what you do...

20090307055319AAJEvw8	Family & Relationships;Friends	If sisters are really mean to you does it mean that they are just jealous of you?	I have two sisters who are really mean to me. They do not include me in outings. They do not include me in dinners they make. At a wedding recently, one came to me and said 'look at you, looking fantastic with a prestigious job!'. I am older, studied really hard, got a good job and look fine but they look good too. They always dated, I studied more. Why do they not like me? My aunt told me that one of them told her that one of her biggest problems is that she is jealous of me. I was shocked. I always tried to help them. Now this. We are in our 30s.
20090307070925AAZTtKl	Family & Relationships;Friends	How should I ask my desk-mate without sounding rude?	Ok, I am in seventh grade and I am in the same desk with a boy I used to like, but not anymore because I have a new, sweet, caring boyfriend and I found out that if he was never going to treat me well, I better dump him. Now we are just friends.   His name is Jackson and we all call him this way, but he likes to be called Jacky. So, he was asking me about my E-mail address and I gave him my Yahoo E-mail address. After that, I went online, but using my MSN account and I saw that a "Jacky" was asking me to be friends. I thought that would be my desk mate, so I accepted friendship request. I always thought that my boyfriend would have give him my MSN account E-mail address because he is the only guy that knows it. So, Jacky went online and I talked to him. He was talking to me in a really weird way, like he was at a bar flirting with me. But afterward, he started talking really rude and I suspected he might be some kind of 20 year old looking for dates, so I warned him to stop and since he wasn't going to stop, I blocked him.   I don't know if that person was my desk mate and I want to ask him whether he was or not...If I ask him, I am afraid he would start joking with me (like he always does) and would tell my boyfriend that I chat to other guys online (if it wasn't him the MSN Jacky)   If he was indeed the MSN Jacky, and I asked him if it was really him, he would then start shouting on why did I block him, he would call me a little girl etc.   Please, tell me how to ask him!

20090307055605AA4g7on	Family & Relationships;Friends	The one who did nothing got all the credit??? Pls advice im feeling depressed?	Ok, so me and my so called friend had to do this assignment and she is not the type who works. She is too lazy and not smart when it comes to studies. She kept postponing the work and delaying and i had to do everything on my own because i wasnt like her. I do everything on time and i am very responsible. All she did was the printing which anyone can do. Even that when i call her and tell her to print something she would say things like oh its too late now and that i should have told her earlier (when there is like an hour left for her to print one page).         Anyway, i did everything and it was now time for the lecturer to asess us where the lecturer would ask questions and we would be graded according to how much we answered. Before the assessment i sent every document to my friend. And she had memorized everything. I was nervous during the assessment so didnt know what i was talking and even the words didnt fit into a sentence.       Before the assessment i had talked with my lecturer many a times to clear my doubts about the assignment and answered many of her questions.          The reason i didnt com[plain to her about my friend was because i didnt want to ruin my friendship.      Anyway i am feeling depressed now because i did all the work and some one else is getting all the credit. And the lecturer doesnt know what i went through to put this assignment together.       The assessment hold only like 4% of the total marks, the rest is on an individual report. but I think about this every single day, even in my dreams i see it.          What should i do? Telling the lecturer now is of no use.And this has happened to me in the past so im sad when i think that when im doing a job people will start taking advantage of me like this and i want get my due credit

20090307064510AAeDQ6p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best guy friend told me that he loved me randomly last night. I could tell he didnt mean it. should I react?	My best guy friend told me he loved me. It's my fault because every time I screw up or don't listen to him or drive him nuts... i say "But you love me anyway". Then he started using my line drunk when he cheats at a game. And yesterday he told me drunk and tried to down play it without taking it back. We don't just randomly say I love you.. I only say it when I screwed up and dont want say i did or when i want something. I do love him as a friend, but that's creepy to say to anyone but family and a boyfriend. He said I love you randomly with his friends. And then as fast as he said that he seems to scample for words by saying Im so comfortable with you and I trust you. I don't think he meant it because I let him go on for a few min trying to take the words back or explain what he meant to say... then I changed subjects for him. He usually thinks about everything before he says stuff, so he must have been pretty wasted. I have no doubt he loves me as a friend, trust me, and is comfortable with me. But it was weird coming from his mouth and don't think it should be a regular thing to say. But it would be weirder to tell him.. i know you love me and i love you but dont say it. He's been their emotionally at some of the worse times in my life. And I'm pretty strong girl... but sometimes just need someone to listen (or even pretend but i dont think he pretends) and give me a hug. And I've tried to be there for him when he needed someone. He's my best friend ever. I tell him stuff before I tell my longest friend or family. He is  really easy to say anything too, but sometimes he has to remind me he's a guy. I kinda treat him as a cross between a boyfriend and a girl friend. And he seems to treat me the same way. I just started dating a guy and he hasnt dated the whole time I have known him. Can I pretend he never said I love you sense I don't think he meant to say it and was drunk? He told me he wasnt that drunk and was a litle buzzed and I could come over and see. I didn't come over because I didnt know what to say. If can not ignore it, what do I say. I did not say anything until i changed subjects for him.
20090307062509AArHVBa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We're so different now I hate coming home. Now What?	Is it time to call it quits because my husband and I are just too different?   We've been together 11 years. I was only 19 when we started dated and so naive, etc. I have started to see how different we are in almost every way and I don't think it is worth hanging on anymore. He doesn't live honestly, our values are different, we come from different cultures, different continents. It feels like he has remained a kid in an adult body; he's not evolving as a person. Thinks it's ok to talk to other women because he's "lonely." Has a porn habit. Drinks too much. Spends most of his free time on the computer. Had his college education completely paid for and failed so many classes he barely completed his associates, an underachiever. "Borrows" from people and never makes an effort to return anything so we end up with so much stuff here and I don't know where it came from. He has sticky fingers and feels entitled to just take what he wants.       Our values are so different. I'm so unfulfilled in my marriage. I'm happier out of the house and don't look foward to going home if I know he'll be there. I don't like to go out with him, because he's loud, attention-seeking, and embarassing. So I avoid going out anywhere WITH him.       I don't even have romantic feelings for him anymore. Not even fleeting moments of strong feelings for him anymore, it's died out slowly in the past 11 years. I don't even like looking at him, I find him repulsive and arrogant as a human being.       I'm still here because we have two daughters and I'm a SAHM with no money. I have so many students loans to pay off, I don't think I could afford to move out on my own and keep up with the student loan payments, even with a B.A. degree (yeah, in Psychology).       Sometimes I can't believe that this is who I chose to marry. I was so young and insecure back then. My mom was mentally ill and I went through a lot because of that before, while and after she was in the Psych ward. Sometimes I wish i could adopt a motherly figure, because I'm really longing for that in my life.      I'd appreciate some wise and gente-worded input.      Thanks in Advance.

20090307071012AAkT94k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How much space and time will fix this?	We broke up on Monday due to me being jealous and not letting her go out this past weekend without me texting and calling her after she received some bad news and wanted to get away. She asked for space and I after a day and a half I brought her flowers and she said they were nice but why can't I give her what she needs that I was making matters worse. I have been begging for a second chance. This was wednesday morning. Thirsday morning she sent an email,(you could tell she was still upset) saaying that she has soo much going on in here life to deal with my drama. She was upset this weekend (over traumatic news) and I wouldnt let her be. This was out of character for me, I was jealous for no reason. So I sent her an e-mail back asking for her to take things slow with me and not to end this, that there was still something left. I waited for her contact and a day later she had asked if I found someone to go to the concert (that we had made plans for previous to all of this). I said I would like for her to go, so my mother watched her son and we went. It was a lil weird at first because you could see her tension and I am sure she was still angry. I tried to kiss her and hold her hand etc, I only got a pec on the lips and it felt weird because I am used to her calling me "baby" and being the one to grab my hand etc, Why am I getting the cold shoulder, did i just not give her enough time to get over the fight? She needs space I know that, but why are my pictures still on the wall at her place and she still has my cellphone from our account, I have a ton of stuff at her place and she has stuff at my place?? Am I over reacting and maybe just need to relax and let this pass? We had a pretty serious relationship, her son loves me, and all of our family loves one another. Can I turn this around?

We broke up on Monday due to me being jealous and not letting her go out this past weekend without me texting and calling her after she received some bad news and wanted to get away. She asked for space and I after a day and a half I brought her flowers and she said they were nice but why can't I give her what she needs that I was making matters worse. I have been begging for a second chance. This was wednesday morning. Thirsday morning she sent an email,(you could tell she was still upset) saaying that she has soo much going on in here life to deal with my drama. She was upset this weekend (over traumatic news) and I wouldnt let her be. This was out of character for me, I was jealous for no reason. So I sent her an e-mail back asking for her to take things slow with me and not to end this, that there was still something left. I waited for her contact and a day later she had asked if I found someone to go to the concert (that we had made plans for previous to all of this). I said I would like for her to go, so  my mother watched her son and we went.  It was a lil weird at first because you could see her tension and I am sure she was still angry. I tried to kiss her and hold her hand etc, I only got a pec on the lips and it felt weird because I am used to her calling me "baby" and being the one to grab my hand etc, Why am I getting the cold shoulder, did i just not give her enough time to get over the fight? She needs space I know that, but why are my pictures still on the wall at her place and she still has my cellphone from our account, I have a ton of stuff at her place and she has stuff at my place?? Am I over reacting and maybe just need to relax and let this pass? We had a pretty serious relationship, her son loves me, and all of our family loves one another. Can I turn this around? We used to hang out and talk and do so many things together and she called me her and her son a lil family, and I am confused why she is pushing me away over my stupidness....Please help...Thanks

I don't know if he is just playing with me, or if he likes me for sex or for something more (between us never happened something!) so...what do you think?

20090307052933AAlO9bF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she not care anymore?	Ok, so me and my ex girlfriend dated for 7 months and im 16 and shes 15.She decided to end it with me about a month ago because i was getting a little too controlling.   We loved eachother very much, we spent pretty much every single day together. we took eachothers virginity.   So 2 days after she broke up with me she was already hanging out with another guy, and they ended up dating 4 days later.   But then she broke up with him after only 3 days. a week after that she started dating this other guy and they have ben together for about 2 weeks now.   But me and her always catch eyes and its weird.. and all my friends are telling me she is always looking at me.   We havent talked or anything for about 3 weeks. i try to text her but she doesn't ever text back. i just say casual things like hey, whats up?I never called her any names or had a temper with her, i was pretty calm about the break up.   My question is why won't she talk to me?   Is there a chance that we will ever get back together?   Do you think she still has any feeelings for me at all?
20090307053405AAdrKmV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Breaking up with my boyfriend... help please?	Okay, i've been going out with this guy for about 6 months now. He's cute and funny so i went out with him for this long without having sex.... he's conservative and said he wanted to wait. But anyway last night i saw him naked for the first time when we were both kind of drunk and cuddling and when i saw his penis i almost laughed out loud it was so small. like only 5 inches. and it looked so weird too, it was like lopsided or deformed or something, i didnt even want to touch it. Anyway i cant think of any reason i can tell him for breaking up with him since he's always been nice to me and everything and he's never done anything wrong. My question is how can i break up with him without looking like a *****??? Thanks

20090307060146AA375oB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Really really really really REALLY annoying friend?	i have this really annoying friend here's what she does (please read the whole thing)   1. she's obsessed with anime. yes she loves to draw it, talk about it, she has posters of it in her room, she even put a picture of an anime girl on her profile on facebook. AND she begs her mom to let her buy japenese candy. i'm not trying to be mean to any japenese people so don't say something like, "your just being prejeduce!" obsession is never a good thing, RIGHT??   2. she crys ALL THE TIME. she cries all the time if the teacher in school yells at her or takes away her pen that she was drawing anime with. (she draws anime in class)   3. she always brags about any new clothes or jewlery she gets. her mom let her get invisiline (which is sort of like invisible braces) and she was talking about it ALL DAY.   4. it's either her way or no way. because if the people that sit at our lunch table don't like her idea, she starts to cry and say, "NOBODY EVER LISTENS TO ME!!" or something like that until they agree with her   5. oh, and not to mention she draws on EVERYTHING SHE CAN GET HER HANDS ON. yeah it's true like once in class when we were getting our tests back she started drawing on my test and the teacher was really mad when we were supposed to get the tests signed because she said that my test still had little drawings on it even though i tried to erase it.      so bottom line i am FED UP. how do i tell her to stop being SO ANNOYING???
20090307063731AAWtayf	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's this feeling that i have? I'm really confuzzled over it.?	Well,there's this one night. And i couldn't sleep.   Then there was this guy on my mind [yea i'm a girl]   and he's new to my school. Only 2days old at the time.   And i tried getting him out of my mind. For like 2-3hours and he wouldn't get out...   so the picture had me up till 2 tryin to get it out...   and then i fell asleep..   the next day i went to school friday 03/06   and he followed my crew to lunch,and during lunch some how   we sat across eachother again.   Well noticing that he looked at me every 5-30secs.   i kinda felt wierd being around him,   and i wasn't nervous.so i switch seats with my friend,lets call her mandy.   And she liked him,he looked a little confused but, it seemed like a whatever.   After i switch seats he didn't keep direction in one place and i stopped looking at him and talked with a group next to us.   Well,then walking to class out in the portables,   i walked with my friend sha-sha and he walked with my friend mandy.   We were talking and she said 'i think he likes you'   i'm like 'who?'   sha- 'matt,'   me -'how?,how you know this?'   sha-'he kept starin at you until we got to this portable'   me-'and? anyone could have looked at you and not like you..'   she-'no,i can tell,okay.I look at his eyes and they don't look normal'   so i turn around and he's not looking...so i was like whatever.   Teacher came I walked into class, seconds later i got up to the door and he was right there near the ramp.And started walking in.   HE sits right in front of me in this class we were in. I switched seats like 2-3 times and finally just sat in my regular seat.   it was awkward kinda...   really all i wanna know is what is it suppose to mean,   when i couldn't get him out of my mind?   the story was just in case you  needed more info.   [idk if this whole story made sense-i didn't proofread]

God, I really don't want to be asking for relationship advice on the internet, but my friends are absoloutley no help.    Anyways, I've been seeing this guy for a while. Theres a lot of weird history there. I had a thing with his best friend ages ago and was in love with him, and he had a thing with my best friend.   Which really creeps me out. They did a lot of stuff together that I just do not want to think about.    I can hardly ever see this boy because he's always training (he's on a big sport team) and I totally forget about him when we're not together.   But sometimes I really like him. And then I don't. And I know he really likes me.    I can't even tell if I find him attractive or not. (I know, weird) but he does have an amazing personality.    Jeez. Is this even worth it?

He isn't particularly good looking but really cute. I know he overheard my conversation with a friend that I liked him, but he didn't seem particularly alarmed. He is quite a shy person but more shy with me than others. When I tried to talk to him he was fine with me but just went even more shy with me. Last night, I went to a party and he was there, I danced with him and he was fine, he also seemed quite comfortable to be dancing with me. Can I just add that he is about the same level looks wise, or maybe a little lower. What does all this mean? Is there any hope?

I guess I was kind of rude to her roommate and 4 friends. They had a lot of fun at my expense. They grabbed me and forced a dress over my head,  tied me up with a pair of panythose and a bathrobe sash and they gave me a makeover and painted my nails.  They took a ton of pictures.  They've offered to destroy the pictures if I go over this weekend and model some clothes and cooperate completely. I was told I'd have to come alone and be extremely agreeable. I really want to destroy those pictures before any of my friends see them. Should I go over this weekend and agree in exchange for the pics they took? I think they plan to take more pics, but at least they wouldn't be as embarrassing. Is this a trap?

20090307072622AAzTaGC	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you reckon my alcoholic dad has had a drink today?	My dad has been drinking heavilly for years and years. He drinks in the morning. Yesterday morning after a big row and lots of tears he stopped drinking and his whole body was shaking all day and his hands shook so bad he couldn't write. He also didn't eat anything yesterday. This morning he was the same but by lunchtime he had stopped shaking and seemed "different" would the shaking stop this soon or is it likely he has had a drink? He says not but I'm not stupid and I am aware of how difficult it is for someone to just stop drinking when they have been drinking heavy for a long time. He says he will go to the doctors on monday as we are al aware he can't do this on his own - I'm worried about him stopping completey like this (if he has) as I know it can have a serious effect on the body.       Thoughts and experience would be appreciated. Thanks

I just watched " alot like love " on tv, and damn I actually liked it, and it was  suspenseful.

20090307075135AAZEgpZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	How should i approach the subject?	ok here is my problem ~ my Little cousin is 17 years old ..she will be 18 in sept. and iam sadden to say that .she is becoming more and more out of control.I have tried my best to give her my advice and be a good remodel for her ..Iam 23 years old , so she has kind of looked up to me over the last couple of years we are extermly close and She knows she can come to me with any problem..the problem is ....I dont want to come off being a beeotch towards her but her mom , dad , and brothers are punishing her the wrong way , because it seems the more they go about it the way they are the more she is rebelling.      she recently started dating a older boy 25 ( i dont approve ) he is also on perole for anger management , and as far as i know might or use to be a drug dealer...they break up constantly but she doesnt listen to me when i explain first he is too old , and second he's trouble.   which brings me to another problem her friend ....20 a young lady whom isnt such a angel ...Iam not saying my cousin is innocent but she does have a chance to turn around before its to late. I just dont know how to step in.   she always wants me to cover for her if she sneaks out ( we dont live together or anywhere near each other so this is hard and most of the time iam at work ) she doesnt tell anyone where she went , who she's with not even me in fear i may rat her out...but i wouldnt ( unless it was a huge problem and i knew she was in trouble ) and when i dont cover for her , she pulls the " i was hoping you would help your little cousin out "    she has no job , she is a drop out not even a g.e.d , she parties way more than i do and if i do go out she wants to tag along an i explain to her the difference between me and her is....im legally allowed to go to clubs or bars and i will get in trouble if Iam corrupting a minor..right?i know thats why i dont take her with me! but im tired of her family beating on her ( her punishments are kinda brutal we are talkin beatings and maybe its right because of the things she does , but she is still a girl with her older brothers punching and kicking her around ) she got locked out the chargers were dropped thank god , but when i went to bail her out she laughed like it was a huge joke...i dont know what to do ! i dont want her to take the wrong path or get hurt but she wont listen to me anymore because im starting to sound like a parent instead of the fun older cousin! please help!
20090307074331AAFGj6z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think if another man/woman other than their spouse is answering someones phone they are cheating?	I've read some questions on here lately, and one person thought that their parent was cheating because some other man answered the phone. that's not always true all the time though, because people lose their phones or leave their phones places and people pick them up and answer them right?      well what about in this case: one person said she called her mom's phone and a man answered and said "she's sleeping." does that mean she's cheating? be honest, where could she possibly be where another man can answer her phone and tell that she's sleeping?      just wondering, because I've known people that have gotten divorces over misunderstandings

20090307075335AAe5YBt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Ok, so me and my friend who's a girl have been friends for about a year. She's in 9th grade and I'm in 8th. We text a lot everyday and I go over to her house at least once each weekend because she's a pretty busy person. So, we watch a movie almost every time we see each other and I've put my arm around her almost every time but she doesn't do anything about it. Last weekend, she came over to my house and after we watched a movie, we just started fooling around on my bed. We just started play fighting for each others phone. This time, we watched the movie with my arm around her and then got something to drink and went to her bedroom. Then we started play fighting over stuff and we were always rubbing against each other. I didn't really mean to but because she was wearing these short shorts, I saw her underwear a couple of times. Disregarding that, I was on top of her and we stopped and just laughed and looked at each other. Then we heard our moms talking because my mom was a little early so we just got up and went.

20090307073349AAR7oUz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just TeLL Her ALReady!!!?	SO i recently confessed to a girl that I had a crush on her. I knew she had a bf that she's happy with and besides that, she's a libra and I'm a taurus. It'll never work out. I'm really jealous and will go nuts if we go out. She said she is happy with him I've been crushing on her for a while, but she has a bf. I told her I understand and that if she's happy with her bf then I guess it's ok. Now...what's funny is that I've gotten over her and I'm no longer crushing on her.   That's why instead of spending too long of a time thinking about it, it's important to just tell her and get it over with.You'd be happy you did and it'll boost your confidence. SO...Just tell him/her and get it over with. LOL I had thought she gave me her land line but it was actually her cell. LOL still, I cant help but wonder what could have been. Her name's Jessica. OMFG she's so damn gorgeous! Long brunetter hair and bold blue eyes. She's beautiful. But not the one for me. LOL See that's funny because I already know it wont work out and it's not even possible as we're two opposites...but for some reason I wanted her. But not anymore. I'm over her now. Time to move on!!!!!!   Any comments, questions...anything?

20090307073431AAVEv7o	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad now wants 100% custody, and mom to have visitation rights.?	If you have read my previous question, you'll know what I am saying here, if not:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Yesterday I snapped at my father, and told him that mom isn't strict on me like he is. I told him that she lets me eat junk and stay up until 3.00 in the morning.       He got really angry, like furious, and said he had no idea she was letting me do this. Now she said he doesn't want me every sleeping there. Ever since my parents broke up, when I was 5 (in 1995), I have been with my dad Monday to Saturday morning, and sleep at my mom's on Saturday nights.       Now he said he wants me 100% of the time. He has had primary custody of me for 13 years like I said, but now he wants full cutsody, and my mom just to have visitation rights. I know this sounds tupid, but what does that mean? I know that the court gave my dad primary custody when I was 5, but what exactly does visitation rights mean? My dad is single, but my mom has a boyfriend, who stays there sometimes when I'm there, and my dad says he doesn't trust him, or my mom.      My dad won't let me spend this weekend with her now, and has spoken to her on the phone, but wouldn't let me speak to her yet. He said he's going to talk to the court before he lets me see her again.      It doesn't sound good, I shouldn't have opened my mouth. He's making a big fuss of nothing.

20090307075403AA2G9rL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	About teacher coming on to student--- what to do!?!?	So first, I'm a serious type of gal (who is also married).   Recently, there was a guest professor who came to my uni to give a lecture. He was 20 years older than me, and I respected him as if he was my teacher.    I was assigned to take him for a visit around the city for half a day. Afterwards, coming back he kept calling and writing me emails saying things that you never expected your teacher to tell you (I assumed this was more like a chemistry-based kinda talking). He also knew I was married too. I really have nothing to do with this guy, if he doesn't want to be a teacher to me. But now I don't know what to write him back or what to do. Please give me some thing to clear my mind with.
