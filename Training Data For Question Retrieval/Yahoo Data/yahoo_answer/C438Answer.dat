First one, make sure you have fifteen minutes spare then sit down on the floor and grab an item of clothing.  Put it onto a hanger and put it to one side.  Repeat this with the other clothing, putting it on top of the first item you have done.  Do this with the others and when you have finished, you put them into your wardrobe with the hook facing you.  <br>  <br>  As you put the clothes back into the wardrobe you turn the hanger around so that it faces the back of the wardrobe.  <br>  <br>  After six months, you go through the wardrobe and any clothes on hangers facing you, you remove, put into a rubbish bag and donate to charity.  <br>  <br>  Second choice, just pick up all the clothes and put into a rubbish bag and then call a charity and ask them to collect all your clothes.  Then you start afresh and make sure that all your clothes don't end up on the floor.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

8apA3Rffaa	For a general rule of thumb. commercial carpets are shorter, tighter and denser as far as yarn per inch.  This gives each fiber more support to with stand higher traffic patterns. You ll find very few commercial carpets that are not 100 % nylon.  They are made of a loop( like residential berber) so your walking on the loop top and not the yarn ends like a lot of ( but not all) residential carpet..Normal commercial carpets are glued down also giving it longer wear since the backing doesn t break down with traffic pushing it down into the padding ( I guess thats the best way to describe it)GL|`|5aIzxIcsaa	Carpets for residential purposes are chosen with extreme care keeping in mind the entire theme of the d√©cor where the carpet has to compliment the arrangement.

Dig over the area thoroughly to remove all perennial weed roots, then cover it with good-qulity permeable weed membrane (if you google this you can find places which will sell wide lengths by the metre, better value than in garden centres.) It's best to have a proper edge to the gravel bed, either paving stones or a run of bricks, to keep the membrane and the gravel in the right place and looking good. You'll need to put footings in and then mortar the stones or bricks in on this, and the membrane can go underneath the brickwork. Buy pea shingle (small sized gravel, usually starts off golden but weathers to greyish) by the ton from a builder's merchant, about Ôø°50 per ton bag delivered in our area (Hants UK) and allow enough for a good 4 -5 ins minimum as it will setlle and needs to be nice and deep.  It's easiest to make holes in the membrane and plant your lavenders, thymes or whatever through the membrane before you rake the gravel over and around, as it gets in the way a bit if you lay it first and then try to get the plants in - this is possible but it's easier to plant them first anfd it keeps the soil from mixing with the gravel. All sorts of plants grow really well in a gravelbed, which is water-permeable but gives the roots the cool protection they like, especially in summer. Your grandparents could have a very attractive low-maintenance garden if you and your Dad did the hard work for them.|`|VFmmVHGVaa	Weed screen is not expensive,use it with mulch and you will save a lot of work.<br>  t|`|YAWkCPqYaa	i put bags of cheap pinkish stones on a lot of my garden , it keeps weeds down and you can put flowers in big pots to make it look nice ,
ww12lItvaa	Do you get ice buildup on the evaporator cover? That would be the cover generally in the back of the freezer. For a few of them it is the bottom of a top freezer. <br>  <br>  It sounds like your auto defrost has failed if defrosting it makes it work for a while. <br>  <br>  Most likely the defrost timer, the bimetal (also called defrost terminator), or the element is out.<br>  <br>  The bimetal is the component I would suspect first and I have replaced many. You would need to ohm it to check. It should be closed when cold. And you can check the element by ohm'ing it also. The timer is checked by forcing a defrost. <br>  <br>  A weak compressor can make it cool on only part of the evaporator and then it doesn't defrost properly but then the freezer wouldn't cool well either in most cases. But I can't tell you that without looking at the frost pattern. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	probably just a burnt out motor. either that or the seal around the door is leaking.|`|AA12164718	try this, take every thing out of your freezer, ice maker too, there are two to four screws holding the back panel , take it out too<br>  now you are looking at the condensor coils and a little fan, plug it in and t-stat in the highest position, the fan should come on.<br>  <br>  while it is open  find the drain hole it will be under the coils flush it clear<br>  not you should have an opening to the frig, the fan blows cool to cold air down the frig thur the back. make all that work and it should be ok
03sLrNPCaa	I haven't used the hanging bag but the bucket style works well for me. Most gardeners that stagger their planting times use two weeks. <br>  For your warm season veggies, tomatoes and peppers, it's ideal to start them inside four or five weeks before last frost and transplant after the soil temperatures have warmed up.  The peas can be planted even if it is still frosting a bit at night but the zucchini and cucumbers you can also direct seed after the soil has warmed.  <br>  As far as fertilizing tomatoes, too much nitrogen will make a big beautiful plant that won't produce much fruit so a balanced blend when the fruit starts to set is beneficial.  You can also side dress individual plants with whatever blend you want, so if you don't want to use the same fertilizer type or amount on all the plants, you don't have to. <br>  Your regular garden soil with well rotted manure or compost worked in is about the best you can ask for.  <br>  Finally, consider planting indeterminate tomatoes. They produce tomatoes all season long rather than a big flood all at the same time like the determinate types. The seed package usually specifies which type it is.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	With tomatoes - they only set fruit when the nighttime temps are within a certain range.  So even if you start your plants at different times....once your night temps get about 85 or so - they'll ALL stop setting fruit.  Then when the temps drop down enough, they'll all start setting fruit.  So for tomatoes, staggering your planting will not really stop the all-at-once "Tomato Tsunami" that tends to happen.<br>  <br>  peppers and squash should not go in until all danger of frost is past.  But you can plant the sugar snap peas NOW.  They are a cool weather crop, and can take light frosts.  They can be planted as soon as the ground can be worked.<br>  <br>  As far as the fertilizer goes - you ask 20 people, and you'll get 20 answers.  Too much nitrogen will cause leaf growth over flower and fruit growth.  If you have good soil, you shouldn't need to rely too much on fertilizers.  If you use potting soil - if it already has fertilzer IN it (many do these days), you won't need extra fertilizer.  if it doesn't, just a general fertilizer, according to the directions on the package, is just fine.  More is not better.

Q7N6EX8Zaa	Get to them before the barn comes down. Use Decon and other bait for rats and mice. I would also use the same at the house, but if you have pets that have access it will be hard to use bait or other chemical methods. You may have to use live traps for the larger unwanted critters. <br>  Good Luck.|`|0ede6ed5af86402f961daba9a691dc95aa	I like the suggestions given by Lori.  You can use bait even if you do have pets though.  Use coffee cans with secure lids, cut a small hole in the lid, put the bait inside and then put the lid on.  I use this method in my yard and my dog and other visiting dogs/cats have never been able to get the lid off of the can.  I would not suggest using this type of bait indoors though, you might have something that dies behind your fridge!  Indoors I would suggest using those old fashioned traps.  I don't know of any chemical barrier to keep mice and other rodents away from your house.  Keep food - especially pet food - cleaned up around the area and the food  securely covered.   Keep an eye out for the signs that rodents leave behind and take action as needed.|`|40a21bfb8e518f15307abcd78298c366aa	I would definitely try to get rid of them before the barn comes down.  If you do not have any animals that would eat it then I would put some D-con in your house, cellar, attic and I would put some in the barn.  They also make one called "One Bite" which looks like an ear of corn but there are several in a package.  Put some of them around and they will eat it and be gone.  Start now, do not wait.

While these things do work, it hurts like the dickens in an open wound. You could soak your hands, in warm water and even add epsom salt. I'm addressing the injuries with this one.

A butchers block can be the trunk of a tree or pieces of wood glued together but either way your knife is working on the end grain.

X6rFPI2laa	Singers used to be the clear favorite, but design and production  have changed and new Singers are not well-regarded at all by busy and experienced people who sew.  (On the other hand, former Singer models like the 221, known as the Featherweight, are in high demand and command very high prices.  The 99K is well-loved and sought-after, too.)  New Singers are not wanted by people who know them.<br>  <br>  Of the current machines on the market, there is a lot of discussion about Janome, Bernina, and a few others, and each has its loyal following and its detractors.  The general agreement, however, is that there is no new Singer that is worth dragging home, and no bottom-of-the-line Brother that is good, either.  In fact, the machines sold at the "big box" stores and chain fabric stores are generally considered worthless, particularly the ones sold at under $300 and those very small "repair everything" hand-held machines, none of which appear to work well and none of which appear to be capable of repair and adjustment.  <br>  <br>  The consensus of advice from those who sew a lot is to find a local dealer who will take care of what they sell, and to sit down and try the various machines personally.  If a dealer won't allow a customer to try a machine, that is a dealer NOT to deal with!  Then, choose the one you like best that has the features you want.  Many people unable to come up with the price (anywhere from $1500 to $5000) will find a used machine to be perfect at a lot less money.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	to me is the Elna it there is no plastic parts is all metal and it lasts for ever|`|drEfr9waaa	A middle aged lady I know swore by her Brother & I've known someone who could sew real well with her Janome.

4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	Begin by digging a hole in the yard find a sunny location preferably on a slope side (they like drainage) put the plant in the hole and use some<br>  bagged Tree and Shrub Planting Mix . fill the whole around the tree (same depth as in the pot) with the mix make sure to pack it tight and fill it good .  Be careful not to break the damage the roots when packing down.  Water daily for about a week or 2 depending on the weather if it's dry or if it's raining.<br>  purchase a small piece of fencing and make a circular tree guard to protect it from wildlife and big feet.  Use some Rooting hormone on it before planting,,,instructions on package.<br>  Treehould come with planting instructions.  Be careful where you plant it unless it's a dwarf it could grow quite tall and big, so allow for growth around powerlines and buildings.<br>  <br>  Missouri USA|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	Hmmm, it sounds like you've purchased a one-year graft.  No matter, it will grow for you just fine.  Just give it some time.  As a very young tree it is like a blank slate that you can work with to shape it exactly the way you want it.<br>  <br>  You won't need to do any pruning on that tree until next season.  Then you want it to start branching no less than 18 inches from ground level (if this is a dwarf variety).  Prune off any branches that are growing at a very narrow angle to the trunk.  Narrow angles are more likely to split and break.  You can also use spacers to keep those angles wide.<br>  <br>  One other thing:  for good pollination and fruit production, you need more than one apple tree and the trees cannot be of the same variety.  However they must bloom at the same time.  Congratulations!  You get to buy another apple tree.|`|E1sqGzmtaa	Plant in full sun and keep it watered. Make sure you dont plant it any deeper than it is planted in the pot or it will die.|`|59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	Did you bought it online? They must have rip you off. Anyway, hopefully it's fully rooted. I suggest you leave it there for now on the pot. You don't want to transplant it right away especially if whoever sold you just transplanted it. Let it establish good on the pot then you can transplant it next year maybe. Position your apple tree somewhere it got good sunlight inside or outside your place. Keep it water thoroughly but not too wet. You don't want the root system to rot. Check the pot too if it got a good drainage hole. Make sure it has some. Just be patient, if it like what your doing and it's location, you will be rewarded with new leaves and new growth. I hope you will enjoy your apple tree for so many years.
x86mC8yyaa	Rather than just choosing one single variety, it would probably look more attractive and interesting if you planted a mixed hedge using a selection of the ones you've mentioned, which would all be good and also would support wildlife, unlike leylandii. I'd add to the list viburnum tinus, which is evergreen and has sweet-smelling, attractive flowers in late winter, also juniper, which is a native evergreen and will grow in a columnar shape. As you don't sound likely to want to prune the hedge to an even-topped shape, a mixture of shrubs allowed to grow up to where you want and then pruned each Autumn with loppers would look more natural and attractive, and would flower or have berries at different times of the year, to add interest and biodiversity. <br>  The trouble with any very fast-growing shrubs or trees is that they don't know when to stop - yes, quite a few conifers such as leylandii will get to 8ft in no time, but then they just go on galloping up, because they are really large forest trees, not suitable for domestic gardens, and if you cut them about too much to control them they look worse than ever.|`|Vv465eJMaa	At this time of year you can buy Photinia quite large but not too pricey.It grows sideways and upwards quite fast.Starts growing end Feb and stops end Oct so one year will see a lot of growth.Buy the 5ft size from B&Q for Ôø°20 each.<br>  Photinia looks gorgeous with the blood red tips.It is tough|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	Techni Arborvitae is a good hedge and is quite hardy.|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Laurel is the fastest growing in my view (after laylendi), you can get different coloured/varigated  ones so that you have some contract and they can easily grow to 8ft .  Just make sure you do not buy plants that are not too small if you want a quick result.  Avoid leylandi like a plague they are not as hardy as laurel in dry weather and they cause trouble.|`|yf1A2FHfaa	Hi, I would say russian vine - its nickname is mile a minute, thats how quick it grows.

AA10332086	Each sprinkler nozzle has a specific hole size and that sets the amount of water that is sprayed. You need to know the manufacturer and the nozzle size to determine its capacity at a given pressure.

I thought it was very hard to control.  So we would take a sample to the pool place, they would test it say we needed this or that.  We would get it, and none of the stuff is cheap once you add it all up, and use what they said and it didn't work.  So, we would go back with yet another sample, the same thing.  They don't know.  We spent hundreds listening to their advice that didn't work.  You do have to keep the pump running non stop.  Then, there is all the debree that gets in there.  Leaves are a total pain!  Hard to get and they make the water filthy.  You have to spend tons of time daily to keep up on this.  Lots of bugs too.  I love a pool, but I will never have another one myself.  I would guesstimate that it will cost minimum of 100 dollars a month to maintain.  And that's if there are no problems.  If your water keeps turning green, it will be more.|`|drEfr9waaa	A civil engineer recommended against my getting a pool.

X6rFPI2laa	If you mean a thing that you put seeds into and grow sprouts for sandwiches and salads, you really don't need one!  All you need is a clear glass jar and a piece of wire or plastic screen to cover the mouth.  I use a jar and screen with great success, and this is how I do it -- start with a clean and very well-rinsed jar, and add about an inch of  water (not hot water).  Pour in about a teaspoon of seeds and swish them around to rinse off.  That will make the inside of the jar wet all over inside, and that is good.   Hold the piece of screen tightly over the mouth of the jar and pour the water out of the jar.  The seeds are now stuck to the screening, so turn the jar upright and tap the seeds off the screen and into the jar. Give the jar a couple of good shakes, which will send the seeds all over the inside of the jar, where they will stick to the sides.  Now just lay the jar on its side and go away.  About twice a day, add water to the jar, shake it around, drain it, shake it and lay it on its side.  The seeds will sprout, have the light and moisture they need, and stay clean and smell nice.  When they are the size you want, have a snack!

7kMCzTVcaa	Vacuum cleaner attachments are useful to pick up dirt from between planks or along edges.  An occasional damp mopping works great. However, your laminate flooring can expand if EXCESSIVE water is used while cleaning.  After damp mopping, a clean dry cloth should be used to wipe your floor thoroughly. Placing doormats or walk-off mats at each entryway will collect excessive moisture and dirt before they enter your home. <br>  <br>  Do not use soap-based detergents or ‚Äúmop-and-shine‚Äù products. <br>  <br>  Never flood your floor with water or cleaner.<br>  <br>  Do not wax or polish your laminate floor. <br>  <br>  Never try to refinish or sand your laminate floor.
