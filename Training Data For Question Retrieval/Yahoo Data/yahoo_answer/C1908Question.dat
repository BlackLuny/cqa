My girlfriend's laptop has been on the fritz lately...?	... and i was wondering what laptop would be a good one for her to have, just for doing essays, talking, listening to her music and watching youtube videos really, nothing high powered like gaming.   I was looking for something less than ￡300 really, that is maximum, but probally starting from about ￡150 but if any decent ones are cheaper then i'm all up for it.   Thank you :)

So, for example, to access that website by using its IP address (and I'm just making this up) 189.153.175.445 accesses "http://www.examplesite123.org," for example. If examplesite123.org had a subdomain "welcome" ( http://welcome.examplesite123.org)  how would I access the subdomain by only using the IP?      You would think it would be  http://welcome.189.153.175.445.com  or just  http://welcome.189.153.175.445  but neither of those work :(      So, how would I access the subdomain of the site just by using its IP rather than typing in its domain name?

I contacted the company I bought this item from, and they've told me that my warranty only has four days on it. After about an hour of sitting on the phone trying to troubleshoot the darn thing they finally offered to send it in for repairs. The man said that since my warranty expired in four days, I would have to pay for the repairs. Is that true? I would think that because I'd made an inquiry about the damages before the warranty was up. Any information would help. Thanks.

Boot camp allows you to run Windows on your Mac computer.      This being said, doesn't this mean a Mac would be better than a PC running windows?  When running Windows on your Mac, it is literally pure Windows- no limitations.      So since Mac can run both, wouldn't that make a Mac computer better than a PC computer running Windows?

I want to connect it to BridgeMaxx High-Speed Internet "satellite" , but Im not sure if it will work. Will I need to buy anything additional to the router in order for it to properly connect, such as a PC card of some kind? Or do I just need an available USB port? I only need to have it connected to one more additional computer, as the 1st computer was professionally installed to it. Thank you.

20090128141539AANrlXO	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Overheating proc on Asus F5 SL. Goes over 68 degrees Celsius, until 72 max?	For a few weeks now, I've been experiencing the overheating problem. The proc, heats up very fast( for example: i turn on the notebook at C, and at C+10 minutes, the prc already heats up to 68 Deg Celsius) .   Until the issue ocurred, the temperature was stationary around 50 to 55 deg Celsius.    To solve the problem, I tried cleaning the dust gathered in the laptop, I opened the botton plastic cover, and swiped the dust there, but still no change in the temperature.   I must mention, that the current temperature(that of 68 to 72 deg) ocurres in conditions of 1 to 15% max proccesor usage. I think that if I were to play a game, and use more that 60% of the proc, the temp would easily go over 80 Deg celsius.   Anybody got a clue of what I could do to stop this.    Thanks!

20090128143001AAaKUse	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Belkin 54g router MAC filtering not working?	I have 1 PC (wired), 1 laptop and a PS3 (both wireless). Using the PC I have enabled MAC filtering in the router's admin panel, put the laptop's MAC on the list, and set "Access Rule for registered MAC address" to "Allow".      As far as I understand this should mean that the laptop is allowed to connect but nothing else.  But this is not the case, the PS3 can still connect and use the internet just fine, and by extension I'm assuming anyone else can too.  As this is the reason I wanted MAC filtering in the first place I'm puzzled.        Please note I know I can do other things to secure my network, such as setting up encryption, but I would like to know why I can't get the MAC filtering to work.  Have I failed to understand something about the concept of MAC filtering?  Or is this a pre-existing bug? I have the latest firmware and have thoroughly tried to Google it so I'm doubtful of that.      Thanks in advance for any help.

I want to learn Java mainly because it's a much more modern and 'trendy' lanuguage that's useful to know nowadays I've heard that people who have trouble grasping the C language usually catch onto Java quicker and visa versa for people who are not good at Java.    I'm not sure how true this is....I'm not even sure if I should have a knowledge of C before I start Java that's why I'm asking.    Is it worth buying the Java for Dummies book and studying it without much knwoledge in C or sshould I learn C first?

I have an old HP Pavilion that I would like to use and connect it to my home network system.  I'm not great with all the techno terms, but I was able to put together my home network using my router by myself!! Which is more than my husband could do!  Anyway, I'm not sure that my old computer is technically capable.  If I can't connect it, then my next option would be to use my existing Dell Dimension 8400 computer, already set-up and in use on the home network.  But I wasn't sure how I could set it up where we could both use at the same time, if we wanted, or just have 2 monitors, 2 keyboards.  The Dell computer has a User 1 and User 2.  I read other questions on Answers that were similar to my question, but because I have limited understanding technically, I wasn't sure if my specific situation was really possible.  My Dell's specs are Pentium 4CPU 3.00 Ghz, 2.99 GHZ, 512 MB of Ram.  I'm not sure what all that means, I copied from the Systems Information about the computer.   Any help would be appreciated

I am looking to sell my Nintendo Wii for about $400 (lots of stuff included) but if I sell it on Amazon or E-bay they take like $45-$60 commission and Im not really willing to do that. Is there a site like that, that I can sell for free (I know there is things like Craigslist but I want something that will get to a bigger audience) so is there something exactly like E-bay but they don't take commission?

So today i decided to delete the version that i had and download the standard Free LimeWire on www.limewire.com. Everything works, exept for the part when i click on it to open it, it says this:   "Sorry, LimeWire ran into a problem while starting up. This is usually caused by a problem during installation. Try downloading and installing LimeWire again. If this doesn't work, visit www.limewire.com and click "Support". You can also send the bug to us so we can try to fix it."   I went and searched on support, and nothing happened. So, can anybody tell me what is going on with LimeWire on my computer? Thanks in Advance   P.S. I use Windows XP

20090128100419AAVsdHw	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How to tell which one went bad, Motherboard or processor?	Ok, I bought a pretty OLD (not even 1 sata port) computer (compac) from my buddy for $100, I installed XP on it, and the proper drivers, and I was planning on giving it to my little brother. However the very next day I turned it on the power light and HDD light both lit up, but nothing would display on the monitor, so I assume the motherboard had gone bad.      after 3 hours of working I got it to boot up again without making any major changes it just magically started working (after being completely rebuilt  3 times) I had the cpu cooler off so the cpu was just sitting there. While the computer was counting up the ram, the CPU overheated. I had it on for maybe 30 seconds, and the processor was so hot I couldn't touch it.      I have tried unhooking all external drives, and even taking the ram out, but now it won't even boot up. I was just wondering what could have gone bad, or how could it have shorted out?      Processor Intel pentium 4, 2.4 ghz. 512 mb ram. compac motherboard.

20090225085120AAVuK5x	Computers & Internet;Software	Am I in trouble? Software?	I recently sold a computer on craigslist. It was a very fancy machine with all the latest gaming components, e.g., i7 Nahalem, Nvidia 260, 8GB DDR3 Ram etc. However, he ended up giving me counterfeit money for it. The Secret Service is on the case atm and will most likely find them due to all the security cameras, e-mails, and phone numbers that were used.      My worry is this: When I sold the computer it had Windows 7 Beta on it. I didn't include any cd of the operating system or anything, but merely just gave him the computer because with whatever was on the hard drive (all legal software). His e-mails asked if I had a copy of XP/Vista to go with it. I told him I could install whatever operating system he wanted on it, but I didn't have a legit key. I just told him that because I didn't want to include my authentic copy of Vista 64. I merely would've installed Vista on it without a cd key, so that he would have to worry about getting his own. But that of course isn't listed in the e-mail I sent back.      Anyways, will I get in trouble for conspiracy to sell illegal software or something? The sale was ultimately for all the nice hardware. I didn't think anything of the Windows 7 Beta I had installed.      thanks!

This worked for about a week. It still occasionally reads the usb drive letting me see the files at first but as soon as I try to drag or copy them to the desktop I get an error "cannot copy File:cannot read from the source file or disk." . At this point I can still see the name of my usb device but can no longer view any of the files. The tech guys in my office building haven't been able to figure it out either(four have tried). The computer dose this with all portable usb drives and portable hard drive, brand new, old  and in between. My co workers messes up in similar way when his machine is restarted. All the USB drives I have tried work perfectly on all other computers, even ones running 64bit xp.

20090128111755AA7qURd	Computers & Internet;Software	Has anyone exclusively changed over to open source and how productive is it for you?	I am currently trying out various Linux distros on an old PC that i have upgraded. I am surprised at how much alternatives to expensive software there are out there and how good they are. I am a student and mostly work with media software (audio production, photography, office applications, etc). I have XP on my main computer and have been very hesitant in changing over to Vista. Thats been my main reason for getting so interested in open source.       So my question is has anyone changed over to exclusively open source and if so how was the transition? Also what field do you work in, applications used etc? Were you surprised with the software?       And to those who have dabbled in it is there anything you can't do with open source that is really essential to your work field. So much so that you couldn't make the changeover? Any formats that you couldn't work with that made it not an option to changeover?      Any pros and cons you would like to point out?       I would really like to make the changeover for good but i am still uncertain. I am pretty much using open source all the time now but keeping XP as a backup in case theres something i cant do. So far there is very little i can't do. Any thoughts?
