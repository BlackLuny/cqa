20090227075335AADqEvY	Pets;Cats	Oriental/siamese cat vocalizations?	I just adopted a 10 month old cat, and we have been told she is part siamese or oriental. She is doing fine after 2 weeks with us, but when she makes noises it is very often a sad sounding, mewling cry. At first I kept running over assuming she was hurt but she seems fine. She does it while playing, running around, interacting with our other cat (who she gets along fine with.) Is she in pain and I am missing something? Or is this just typical for the breed?

So far the two Ive come up with are Darko and Fitzgerald. I am looking for something from maybe a classic literary or movie reference, but really just something original, but cute. Any ideas?

20090227082610AAD7sjT	Pets;Cats	Is the stray cat about to give birth?	so a few months ago a very thin cat came to my house and i have been feeding her ever since.  i had also made her a house outside with 2 large tub containers attached to one another with tons of bedding and such(and there is a flap/roof to prevent rain and such from comming in). also she is still living outside since i cant take her in right now(manily b/c of my parents), but i have a feeling that i will when the kittens come    anyways i think she is pregnant and idk the exact date but  if i am right she should be either this week or the next.    well today she was acting werider than normal. usually when i get up around 8 or 9 i go outside to feed her cat food (well kitten food since she is pregnant) and today she was already at door meowing when normally she just hangs out waiting of me to come. and then when i went to feed her she barely ate anything. this has been happening for the past 2 days now. then after she barely ate she came to me and wanted me to pet her and she keep going on her back. then when i was leaving she followed me and kept meowing for me to come back. which she sometimes does but today it was more than usual. she kept at it so i went outside to c what she wants and i sat on the floor and continue to pet her. and usually when i sit on the floor she climbs on my lap but this time she was about to but then decided to walk to the shelter i made her and it seem like she wanted me to follow her. which was werid to me since she rarely use the shelter unless it rains or i think at night. she usually likes to lay outside in the sun. so i did and i was looking at the shelter to c what was wrong. nothing was unual in there so i just clean it out a little (took out like 4 leaves) and then she went inside. i then decided to leave just in case she wanted to be alone and then i would check back. then when i did she was just sleeping. that was around 930ish. and i havent check back on her yet. i will in at 12.      so u think it is about time for kittens to come.

20090305103157AAaHvCZ	Pets;Dogs	My dog is having exploritory surgery. Please give thoughts.?	My dog is having to have surgery b/c they believe he has pancretitis and he has fluid build up in his stomach. They are not sure what the main cause is. His symptoms are vomiting, depression, adominal pain and weakness. He can still walk but is very weak. They have him at the emergency clinic. Do you think they would want to do the surgery if they thought he wouldn't survive. They also said it might be a possibility that he will have to be left with an open adomain for drainage. I guess I just want to hear from others that have been through this. It is very  hard to come to terms that there may be a possibility to have to make the decision to pt him to sleep. Please give advice and if you have been though this please tell me the story.

Soon as I mentioned they where ferrets the woman snapped and ranted on about how she had a degree to be a vet and they are rodents and not domestic pets. To clear this up ferrets have been domesticated for over 2,000 yrs and also they are not rodents at all they are mustela (sp) they are not rodents at all. She kept arguing with me and just kept snapping and said she would not help me or my pets at all. I just wanted to see if they could do a check up for them was all, nothing difficult about that now is there? On another not there are two specific breeds of ferrets and one is a domestic breed which is commonly used for breeding for ferret pets and the other is the more and commonly know endangered wild ferret I cannot remember the name of the wild black footed ferret but still my point is I want to report them for this ignorance and refuse to help or offer any help to my pets. I even have their paper work with me, and the records of their last owners, their food diets, and everything else about them. It angers me to hear and know a animal clinic/vet is refusing to help an animal and knows nothing about them! I think her degree should be checked!

(She will be a month on June 28th) And she has fur and everything, so im not sure how old she is, because i asked about my rat b4, and someone said that she would be 7 weeks old the way i described her. So, im really not sure, but with the summer class i am taking, all the students get an albino rat to care for 24 hrs a day, and people say that a rat needs a rat friend to be happy, but is that really nessisary? Because some students in the class cant keep their rats because their parents wont let them, so i may be able to take someone elses rat at the end of the class (in 2 more weeks). But if my rat really needs a friend, should i have gotten it earlier? Because i thought they needed to get them a friend as soon as possible, so they dont get too old. Please let me know.       P.S. - Yes i know that they have to be the same kind to be together, like girls and girls, or boys and boys

20070221010737AAKVN7F	Pets;Dogs	Couple of questions about my dog?	Okay my first question may seem a little odd but it confused me. I have never had a male dog before so forgive me for the ignorance on the issue.....but when male dogs are neutered, do they always castrate them? I had my male cats neutered and they still "appear" to be intact as they only cut the sac to remove the testicles then close the wounds and it fills with fluid appearing normal. Yet I was brushing my dogs belly last night and noticed he has NOTHING but a penis. No sac, no anything. Is this common practice?      My second question is, what would make a dog not like the good foods? I have tried feeding him Natural Choice, Iams, Science Diet, Pro Plan, Pro Plan Select, and Authority. No luck, he refuses to eat any of it. He will nibble here and there but no real eating and he's losing weight now. Vet says he's perfectly healthy, all tests came back normal. Suggested just trying new foods to find one he'll eat. More info coming.........

If I was to give her away, would she adapt to a new family, or remain hostile. Has anyone gone through this before? Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks.

My 9 week pup is sneezing quite often when I bring him outside now that the pollen is in the air...But, it's not causing a breathing problem or anything. So I am not worried that it can be anything worse. And he is up to date on shots...      But, how many of you also have a dog with pollen allergies?

I found one that is 6 months old & weighs 2 and a half pounds! Average chins weigh anywhere from 4-7 and then some may even weight up to 16-18lbs! There are two different sizes of chins. Anyways, the 2.5 lb. 6 mon. old girl is absolutely precious. I want to adopt her so bad, but I'm a little worried since she is so tiny and possibly having health or genetic problems that I don't know about now or later on. The lady is willing to give me a 72 hours health guarantee where I can take her to the vet and get her checked. She has also had all of her shots & has had no health problems and potty trained. She hasn't started her on heart worms and that concerns me (she has a lot of other dogs too). Should I adopt her & take her straight to the vet or wait. The lady bought her for herself to breed, but the puppy is too small to breed. Pup is not resistered, I don't want to breed/show. Should I get this pup or keep looking??

The breeder warned me on how tiny she is before i went to get her. I met the parents of my puppy, which the mom weighs 5lbs and the dad close to 5lbs., so they are fairly small but healthy. I saw "Tootsies" (my puppy) sister and brother as well and seemed very active and healthy as well. My puppy is extremely active, eats great, always wants to play but just is real tiny. She will only weigh in at full growth no more than 3lbs im assuming, since ive heard 6 months they stop growing and shes already at 5months. She swears shes a big doberman or something, always playing with the big dogs and chasing them around! Im just curious if she will overall be a healthy tiny min pin?

I was told that her first heat would be in-between 6-8 months (I think thats what I was told!) and she is prob about 7 months now and I have been watching her very closley because I have a male dog and she is WAY too young to get pregnant now so I need to seperate the dogs. I caught the male dog sniffing her...I know that dogs do that but she was backing away with her butt against the wall and he was going underneith her...      I know they dont bleed right away, and that at first its just a signal her body lets out that will drive the male crazy...so maybe that is whats happening. When should I expect to see blood? any other signs so I know for sure?

Her stomach is very rounded and looks like she has little balloons/pouches on her sides. She is very jumpy and don't like coming out of her hutch she just runs away when we try and get her.      Her nipples are quite big and yesterday i think we saw what looked like babies kicking inside her. I am just worried where she is quite small and looks young that she may not survive. She has been eating quite a bit as well and has also been doing loads of number 2's and yesterday she done about 3 wees in under 10minutes.      Also we have got a baby female guinea in the hutch with her she is only 12 weeks will she be ok with the older one if she is pregnant or should they be seperated. they seem to have a bond as when they are both out the bigger one will call the little on and they will play follow the leader.      Can someone help me please :@)

I am 13 years old and recently i got 2 guinea pigs for the first time and i would just like to know if i am looking after them right.      Am i feeding them right?   In the morning before i go to school they get guinea pig mix or guinea pig pellets (they also have hay in their cage) And for dinner (around 7:30-9:30pm) they get a bowl of veggies (Carrot, Broc, Parsley, Capsicum, romain lettuce, and other veggies) (I change it around, so they dont have the same thing every night) And once every couple of days they get some pieces of fruit like apples, strawberries, grapes or melon as a treat.      I get them out for cuddles daily and they get bushed daily, they have a large wire run that i put on my lawn for them so they can get to run around (And they do heaps of popcorning so they must be happy)      They have a large wooden 2 story hutch with lots of chew toys and tunnels and hides. And i have also made them some pillows that they love to snuggle on.      (They also have fresh water all day and every couple of days i put some vitemin C drops in there water.       Anyway just tell me if im doing ok. Thanks X

20081003121756AAtunf6	Pets;Cats	My cat's seem to shed terribly. Besides brushing, is there anything else I can do?	They also have a lot of dandruff. I'm not sure where this came from. They are both indoor cats and recently been to the vet-with no problems. (get their latest shots) I know that animals shed, especially before the seasons change. However, I have never seen them shed this much before. I have to vacuum every day and their fur is all over my couch. We moved about 6 months ago. My Husband seems to think the Central Air has something to do with it. Could the heating/cooling effect their coats? Is there anything I can do to try to remedy this at home before taking them back to the vet? (I am 8 months pregnant, and my husband works 12 hour shifts-so getting to the vet is not the easiest thing to do quickly!)

C'est une question qui demande ce que pensent les gens à propos des zoos, si c'est bien ou non, si ?a améliore le sort ou non des animaux.   Voici ma réponse à Floriane :   Moi aussi, j'aime énormément les animaux.   Les zoos sont hélas vitales de nos jours, pour éviter que certaines espèces animales disparaissent.   Heureusement que les zoos ont beaucoup changés.   De nos jours, beaucoup de zoos en France participent à la sauvegarde des espèces en faisant féconder des couples d'animaux rares (pour cela, les zoos s'échangent des animaux), et parfois, si les dangfers sont minimales, on réintroduit les espèces dans la nature, pour qu'ils reprennent la vie sauvage. Mais ?a reste très dur, les braconniers sont encore très méchants, et en plus on dégrade encore la nature en divers endroits de la Terre.

She is a boston terrier 17#, was bit by an extremely larger dog on her back left thigh, I took her to the vet, was told she had no fracture and would be put on antibiotics & a pain killer. told to just give her a place to rest and relax and heal.

I went to pick her up and she turned her head real quickly and made a growling noise. (I didnt see any teeth), but it made me really upset and sick to my stomach. She's done it before, and it bothers me. She's done it like once before, and we got her in February. She is a jack russell mix. We are not sure how old she is, and we don't know a history on her because we adopted her, and they just got her a couple days before, they found her on the road. Should I be worried? My boyfriend plays with her all the time in covers and she'll play bite but she'll wag her tail, but when he comes out she is fine and licks him. She's bit one person but that is because he was terrorizing her. She's a good dog most of the time. It just makes me nervous that she might bite me or showed and sign that she was about to.

A little extra info, it can't be able to jump a 6-ft fence. Also, No one is going to be at the house from 9:00 to 2:30, so it has to be good. Please make it a nice dog, that likes children, and MAYBE cats. If it doesn't get along with cats that's fine, it would just be a plus.    I don't care if its a tiny dog, or a huge one. NO PITBULLS OR ANY OTHER DANGEROUS ONES. I also don't care if it's an indoor or outdoor.

20070801233346AABncnz	Pets;Dogs	Will my puppy never fully recover from Parvo?	About a month ago my 4 month old puppy had parvo. She had to stay at the vet for 5 days hooked up to an IV until she was better. Once I brought her back she seemed fine (was eating and drinking, not throwing up, ect). But ever since she came back she seems to always be tired and sleeping a lot. She still has her little spurts of energy (she's a mini pinscher so normally she has LOTS of energy), but it seems like now all she ever wants to do is sleep most of the time. I went for a post check up at the vet and told them that she is sleepy all the time but they said she is fine and not to worry about it as long as she is still eating and drinking normally which she is. So....I've heard somewhere that after puppies get parvo they never fully recover 100%. Is this true? Should I just get used to her being a lazy dog now?
