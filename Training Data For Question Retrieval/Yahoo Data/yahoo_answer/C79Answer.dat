Most of the Democrats and some Republicans want to discourage savings to prop up our economy.   The Democratic economy actually works bad is bad in the long run.    They take the money from the middle class and gives it to the poor.  THe poor spends 100% of their income and gives their moeny to the rich.   The more the poor spends the more tax dollars the government gets .   Our GNP would increase that way.   The problem is that it hurts the ability for the poor to move out from being poor.   Obama does not want us to save because if we save, the money is not being used and can't be taxed. You belong onthe other camp.  Personal responsibility.

9P3uKmPlaa	The fact of the matter is that it isn't George Bush's fault. The recent market collapse is ALL due to Obama's economic policies and cramming democrat trademark policy down our throats. They have been drooling for an opportunity to do this but haven't been able to because they couldn't get it through congress until they had full control of both the executive and legislative branches of government. The funny part is he'll NEVER get elected for another term, and the first president to follow him is going to erase everything he thinks he has accomplished. The sad part is we have to live through it and pay for it for 4 years. He knows he isn't going to get another term so he's starting with this crap right off the bat, coming hard and fast with it. It isn't over yet either, he's got LOTS more to shove down our throats, and it won't stop for the entire 4 years. The American taxpayer gets to foot the bill for it all. Sorry if I sound like I'm blaming Obama, but I AM, he's screwing us and deserves the blame.|`|CEiyYCqaaa	Seems like the Obama Presidency is the making of a new kind of liberalism.<br>  <br>   A sort of neoliberalism.<br>  <br>  The Democrats stand to make tons of money from the bailout in pork money to their Green companies.

I have the opposite impression. It seems to me that Obama is saying that he will do TOO many things, and that his speeches are focused on grandiose plans. Even so, that's better Bush's approach and philosophy that government can't do anything.  Why did he want to run the government anyway?<br>  <br>  To get back to your question, it seems to me that since he was elected, Obama has said very little about George W. Bush. In fact, it reminds me of how George W. Bush railed against Bin Laden for about 2 months after 9-11, and then rarely mentioned his name again.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Of course it matter whose fault it is. Without knowing whose fault it is, the history then bound to be repeated.<br>  Why do you think the right wing already start a huge campaign with their strong media backings to re-write the whole history, absolving any fault from Bush and putting blame to Obama (even from his first month in office apparently he has destroyed american economy according to the right wing)<br>  <br>  I don't know whether you're truly independent, like me. But putting blame where it belongs is very necessary ina democracy so that we make sure the guilty party pays.<br>  <br>  If only people moves quickly and see the problem with how Reaganomics caused this whole mess and the way he was willing to break law to get what he want (Iran-Contra) is an issue instead of pure partisanship back then and make sure He knew that he didn't get elected because of that, then America will be better.<br>  <br>  If only people moves quickly and told Clinton that he won't get away with kicking the unequal trading door with China that Reagan opened to such a massive scale that everything in US ran to China.<br>  If people told Clinton he won't get away with bowing to pressure and signed NAFTA.<br>  If people told Clinton he won't get away with letting the whole deregulation goes on and started the whole ownership society that George W. Bush became famous with.<br>  If he got kicked out of office because people said that he won't get away with those rather than the whole stupid show by an adulterer in Newt Gingrich pursuing Clinton's sexual escapades.<br>  <br>  If people could tell George W. Bush that trampling on the Constitution is not acceptable and he should step down immediately.<br>  If people could tell Those duos that the whole war profiteering is not acceptable.<br>  Then real change might happens.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't. The neo-cons Right wing just listen to their hypocrite source of information that fills them full of lies in Druggie Limbaugh, unable to think for themselves, only seeing things from one point of view and a slanted, often misleading ones too.<br>  And the far left go at it with no quarters, full on gay marriage, let them re-arrange the whole society, full on pro-choice with their mantra it's her body (with no regard that she doesn't use her brain when she f**ck*d and got pregnant).<br>  <br>  By all means, the country is ready to go down the toilet with both far side being brain-dead, filled with rhetorics from their media gods in Rush Limbaugh, O'Reilly and to a smaller scale the left wing with their crazy foul mouthed Mike Malloy.<br>  <br>  I wish people can grow up and rather than not playing the blame game, actually play the whole political game as a clever participating citizens that ensure democracy process really happens.|`|GFOdY3nBaa	he will keep remind us every time he can. not because he cant solve it, and it matters right now whose fault it is. but because it is a huge deal now to bring Bush to justice for the war crimes. there are conspiracies he will stand the trial after they are dont investigating everything they can find. <br>  honestly, it is Bush's fault, and Obama have all right to keep repeating it. it makes me mad what kind of deep s*** we are in because of W. so, why so many people blame Obama for what he is trying to do, while THIS IS REALLY NOT HIS FAULT!!!!!|`|OLCoFKQraa	I agree with you, but I won't continue the failed policies of the last 8 years, alright, I just won't, and that's what YOU want, you're talking about continuing the policies of the last 8 years, it doesn't matter what you said, that's what you're doing, you suck, and Obama RULES, you know why?

The company would bring in H1Bs who had degrees from the University of Bangalore or Punjab or Mumbai, but had no experience, couldn't speak English well, and really weren't that smart.  American workers had to train them as their replacements.<br>  <br>  Believe me, we have more than enough skilled Americans to fill the necessary jobs.

We tolerate those who push their culture over ours.    On average, they make a contribution to our society.  Our economic growth comes from us accepting the brightest.  We take their knowledge and create things to sell to the world.   Their understanding of foreign culture gives us insite  on our problems .  They look at our situation from a different point of view. They help us improve trade because they understand the needs of other countries and help improve relations withthese countries.   They bring new talents and knowledge.   <br>  <br>  <br>  I consider a good essay something fair. One that looks from different points of view and is self critical.

FfxmE9Toaa	No there will not- unless Israel decides to attack. There is no reason for the U.S. to get involved. Consider this: Iranians are quite proud of the fact they have not invaded another nation in over 300 years. Saddam invaded Iran, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  The nuke issue is way overblown. Also consider both Russia and India have pledged to protect Iranian airspace. That should give any country pause. Indian fighter pilots are as elite as America's.<br>  <br>  Iran has elections coming in June and former president Khatami is running. He was a reformer for 8 years and tried to ease tensions with the U.S. All intelligence reports indicate Khatami had the nuclear weapons program ditched in 2003., the same time he reached out to President Bush in detail in an attempt to restore relations.<br>  <br>  The Iranian people are very Westernized and hate their government. Don't let that little howler monkey of a president fool you. Everyone you see protesting in the streets is a government worker who would lose their job if they didn't show up.<br>  <br>  **So To Be: Are you really showing us you do not know Iran is in central Asia and not the Middle East? Boy, you got you some studyin' to do.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	I dont think we have a Constitutional right to pre-emt war on an assumption. especially an assuption comming from a sec. of state who is completely hostile toward the mulsim nations.  Who cares if they develope a nuke. We have hundreds of thousands.   We are fretting day in and day out about a nation who will get obliterated if they even try it....our shielding technologies along with out missile defense program will intercept at any attempt, and if it doesnt, then we are at risk from any nation (perhaps a 2million man army...China) for a ground invasion and we have been waisting trillions on a government who preaches absolute security.<br>  <br>  <br>  The real issue here is that Iran has a majority of the worlds oil, and if Iran becomes independent from oil, and the US does not,  then they very well could become the worlds next superpower...right next to China... all while we go bankrupt and martial law is declared.|`|w8lwOcG4aa	Inevitable? no.<br>  Iran is a rational state no matter what is fed to you by the US media, if smart people are in power then we don't have a problem, unfortunately there are alot of stupid people in the world.|`|4zeazkWOaa	I don't know but as an Iranian I won't let any invader pass our borders while I breath<br>  if we're going down we'll go down fighting|`|peybb4Foaa	yeah i think sadly there will be war.<br>  and it will be another proof of how stupid people are.|`|jWTZfP4naa	OK, let's start at the start.<br>  <br>  First, we are already at war with Iran. If you don't consider the economic sanctions we have been depressing their economy with to be an act of war then at least consider that we and the US have had Iran surrounded both on land, by sea and under the sea for years on years now, frequently trying to elicit acts of aggression from them by entering their waters. it's been going on for more than thirty years now and we've frozen billions of dollars worth of their overseas investments which they will never get back.<br>  <br>  Second, this thing about them developing nukes is a real misnomer.<br>  Pakistan is already in possession of nuclear arms, nobody is suggesting we invade them, destabilise their economy, topple their democracy or hold their country seige.<br>  Iran has the right, just as any other country does, to develop nuclear energy which remains a more carbon-efficient method of generating power than burning oil or coal.<br>  <br>  let me be really clear about the next part.<br>  <br>  nobody has either:<br>   a) demonstrated that Iran is even trying to make a nuclear bomb/<br>  <br>  b) implied that Iran should not develop nuclear energy plants<br>  <br>  The entire pretext for this war remains economic. UK + US have said that Iran can have all the nuclear isotopes it wants, but it isn't allowed to cook it's own. Iran has to buy them from us at the price which we will dictate. <br>  predictably the price is unacceptable, and i don't know if you've noticed but we're not great people to do business with. <br>  Also, Russia have undercut us on the isotopes- so we now are claiming that Russia are trying to arm Iran.<br>  <br>  <br>  end of the day- If Iran would just give us their oil at the price we are willing to pay them for it, there wouldn't be a problem. but they won't- so we're going to have to start a civil war in that country. lucky for us their president is an idiot.|`|2zA14zk6aa	it all depends on what the bullies are doing. the USA  think they own the world cos they like to tell other countries what to do. the whole saga is that the USA what iran to buy the technology from them if the ever want nuclear power. the iranians have the same right and minds to master the technology, they can run their own things by themselves. iran is a country with more than 5000 yrs of history unlike the USA with just 200 yrs of history or something.  No matter who will start the war,,, israel or USA.. they know it is gonna cost blood and money cos iran is not a simple country, they have money and money buys anything. why did they let countries like pakistan, india and nkorea to have nukes? nkorea pulled out of the np treaty one week before it test their nukes. where was the USA? all they want is iranian oil for a cheap price, fullstop!|`|jeEEVXaLaa	I don't see how or why the US need to be dragged in. Maybe i'm just being ignorant but i don't see what business it is of the US. <br>  <br>  See, there are about 190 other countries in the world and you don't see them lining up their troops to stick their nose into EVERY single battle.|`|iE7noPQPaa	their will be a war between them!!!|`|sgEloO1Jaa	yes, if not then N.

9DHWNGeeaa	Because people like to shout and yell. Heard the term the empty can rattles the loudest?<br>  <br>  There is problems in every branch. No one branch is better then the other unless there is a specific skill set you want to learn from the branch, but then again the only real unique branch is the Navy, because the Army has jets and Navy has their underfunded Army.<br>  <br>  Food? I find food to be all the same. It is a matter of preference. If you ship out to the sandbox and are part of combat arms, you aren't going to be sitting on a cushy FOB and lazying about, you are going to eat stripped down MREs until you puke.<br>  <br>  Barracks, it is all horny early 20s to mid 20s kids running around, basically the same experience for every branch.<br>  <br>  I will say one thing, yes Air Force does have the hottest looking women in the armed forces.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Air Force does have the hottest girls. My first experience with Air Force women was my first time at MEPS, she was Air Force JAG I believe, completely smoking hot. The other girls who were enlisting with me at the time who were going to join the Army were complete tragedies, and the girls who were joining Air Force were passable to hot.|`|qzfAG3ciaa	I joined the Army because of the job.  When I found out I couldnt fly, there was no point in joining the Air Force, because with a few exceptions, most Air Force jobs outside of pilot are office jobs.  I didnt want the Navy or Marines because I hate ships.<br>  <br>  Also, I have seen bad Army food, but I have also seen Army food that was better then Air Force food.  It depends on the resources available.  Plus, Army food is a lot cheaper overall since the Air Force charges you by the item, Army give you one charge for all you can eat.<br>  Overall, I think the Navy had the best food as long as you were within one week of the ships re-supply.  Even though Im Army, I still got stuck on a ship for 6 months.<br>  <br>  As for women, I have to dissagree with the Air Force having the best looking.  The Marines seem to be better looking if you can keep up with them.|`|hjxh2Y6faa	No branch has hottest girls and all that mess. The Army prepares you for real world experiences in war. I mean, what if they were to give you everything, when the time of war comes, you would be miserable from lack of proper food and comforts. The AF doesn't really prepare 100% for ground situations because the chance of that is very slim. The AF is more intelligence-based and they guide the other branches into safe zones and launch long range air attacks. Each branch has its role, and they all have to work together to achieve success!|`|AvikHSA8aa	well the AF is very picky of the applicants they recruit.  AF/Coast Guard has a higher minimum score for the ASVAB.  less than 1% are GED holders.  you have to have a clean record.  they are also overmanned, go fig.  there are more girls in the AF than any branch because there are more jobs that don't involve "combat", and AF has the lowest physical standards.  while Army has enlistment bonuses, it makes sense that only combat jobs in the AF offer them because we treat our people better, and we're the only branch that automatically puts our personnel in CCAF.|`|xja6cfaKaa	I live for the Navy.<br>  I personally detest the Air Force, as I've been on an AF base for as long as I can remember. The AF pales in comparison.<br>  <br>  But the Navy lifestyle isn't for everyone either.<br>  <br>  ALSO. There is no "Best" or "Worst" branch in the military. A best or worst is a personal opinion, not a fact. And you shouldn't believe everything you read.|`|iE7noPQPaa	the marine corps is the best branch - its not about the best food, barracks, or even girls. its about the training and toughness and putting your ability to the test!!! So grow up and join the marines!!!|`|9DgV7WIkaa	If you want the :Worst" Training. Do Navy Seals Training.|`|NiCWVNHZaa	no, the army is nice in some places....everyones experience differs...|`|tZqi3hwwaa	Everybody doesnt join the airforce because, we are more willing to find out what we can do for the military instead of the other way around.. Dont worry, I used to think the same way until alot of veterans opened my eyes up.. At the end of the day, the airforce doesnt live in hilton hotels. The airforce has some pretty bad barracks too. Besides, its not like you're gonna be there 24/7 so what difference does it make? Im not in the military, but Im planning on joining and I really hope I've helped..|`|PWvS7vqPaa	Because some of us don't join a service just for a comfy lifestyle.  We join it to do our part and get down and dirty because someone has to do it.<br>  <br>  If the sole reason for someone joining a branch is because they think it will be easy, then they are not going to make it, no matter which branch they pick.|`|f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	I tell people never join the army and try to get into the airforce.   Army works harder and the air force generally train you on something marketable.   What good is it that you are trained on a high tech equiptment when no one else but the military uses it.   I would warn with the downfall of the airline industry, the marketability of someone from the airforce has diminished.   As to why people join other services, people join the navy to see the world.   The Marines for  bragging rights.   As or the girls, Perhaps your right, but as for services, there is something about a girl in a naval outfit.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Air Force the best?! HA! <br>  <br>  <br>  I joined the Army not for the food, the barracks or men~ sorry not into women.   Though if I did join to see some male eye-candy, would definitely joined the marines... <br>  <br>  Anyways, I love the US Army. Torii Station doesn't have a Dfac, so I get extra money to make my own food, or go to a restaurant and buy food. <br>  <br>  The barracks I live in right now because my hubby is in CA, I live in a room that is meant for two people. Yet I have it to myself because MY Sergeants Major said he wanted his soldiers to be treated like adults.<br>  <br>  <br>  Last time I checked, every branch on Okinawa hates the Army because we have no restrictions because MY Sergeants Major said we don't need curfew because unlike the marines, we don't go raping Japanese girls, unlike the Air Force, Marines, and Navy, we don't get drunk and go driving and we sure the hell don't go breaking into Japanese people's houses to fall asleep in.  The Japanese don't even know the Army is on their island because we ARE the best branch here because it seems only the Soldiers know how to act right.<br>  <br>  You can thank my SGM for that one.|`|HvbIE03saa	Because not everyone necessarily qualifies for the AF. The AF has had the benefit of being allowed to maintain their higher standards because they have fewer positions that need to be filled as compared to, say, the Army. Not to mention the AF has a lot more money than the Army, and the Army has more money than the Marines, and I dunno where the Navy falls in...probably along with the Army.<br>  <br>  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not kissing the Air Force's butt (I like the Marines more), but it's the truth.<br>  <br>  And honestly, the Army has better chow and barracks than the Marines. I think the only thing they have worse than all the others is their deployment time...18 month deployments? I give a lot of credit to soldiers for enlisting who know that they have the possibility to go to hell for 18 months, possibly longer.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the girls in the AF are the "hottest" because they don't actually have to do any work or get their hands dirty... ; )<br>  <br>  (And all you AF girls who are about to jump my **** for that, get over it, I was making a joke.)|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	the airforce is amazing. the girls in the AF are very pretty, but there are 'hot' girls in every branch of the military..(if you want to join for that reason that sucks)<br>  Air force bases are always very very nice and even the dorms in Turkey are nice!! very small, but nice.

Obama, for all his good intentions, increased our funding by almost 5X in the upcoming program year, expecting service providers to hire unemployed individuals that have no prior experience doing what we do, and put them to work immediately.<br>  Most states have limited training capabilities and certainly cannot handle a ramp-up of that magnitude.<br>  Odds are that most unemployed folks won't want to crawl around in attics, crawls spaces, and under mobile homes for $8-$10/hour anyways, so training may not be a valid concern.<br>  IF we are able to hire staff, in two years when the money goes away (that's the Monopoly money Obama's printing with nothing to back it up) the staff gets laid off and goes back to unemployment... niiiice!<br>  Obama has assured us that staff will simply switch over to his newly created "green jobs"... really?<br>  Until heating fuel climbs out of sight, those green jobs will also not be in sight.<br>  When energy's cheap, you think Americans give a rat's azz about saving energy???

Unfortunely in life we will end up being in places that we hate.... the inlaws- etc school teaches those that hated being there how to deal with it...... <br>  There and Their....... both or spelled corrected one is a place and the other is belonging too.... some parents might not know that......|`|oJMAUKipaa	Certainly are some interesting answers here.<br>  <br>  The far left actually does try to indoctrinate in public schools and a lot of things they teach, especially in the science fields are outright lies or fabrications.<br>  <br>  Some of the far right use home schools because they are afraid of exposing their children to leftists. Though this may be desirable it may be over protective of their kids. Not trusting them to make correct choices.<br>  <br>  The government on the other hand should have less say in some things but should definitely monitor the education system so that some kind of equality can be maintained.<br>  <br>  You have to remember the main difference between the right and the left using democrats and republicans here as an example: The republicans like to make decisions on facts or what they think is fact. The democrats make more decisions on emotion.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	It gives control back to where it belongs.  To the parents.  <br>  <br>  Liberals are about having control over every aspect of people's lives.  When children are home schooled Liberals don't have any control over them.  <br>  <br>  That and with homeschooling kids are actually being educated.  Not indoctrinated.|`|39KUKALFaa	You are right.  But the reasons are simple.  Home schoolers show up the waste and destruction of the teachers' unions.  If you can do so well for free, why do we need ever more bountiful "education" budgets.<br>  <br>  Second, if you home school children you generally do not teach them the far left agenda - two, four, six, eight, sex by eight or its too late AND we hate the USA.<br>  <br>  They also hate vouchers and part of the delay in Washington D.C. on the budget is that the Dems want to cut off a voucher program for poor children in D.C.|`|g5pLCOm3aa	its all part of their agenda to keep as many kids in a structured, controlled environment, consequently "dumbing" them down|`|KoxBca7waa	homeschooling allows for a person to be raised by the parents ideals and not by the standardized herd. Shame on people who think they may know whats better for their kids than the Government.|`|XsI7ISqsaa	because schooling your kid at home will only lead to a kid with no social skills. religious parents who home school brainwash their kids aswell|`|EE07GFcdaa	the main problem i have with Home schooling is it hands the control over to the parents whom might have their childs best interest at heart but are not really teaching them what they need to know! for instance very religious parents will teach their children creationism and skip the important parts of biology, earth science, and all the other fundemtally important studies that will get there kid through college!<br>  <br>  it also takes away the importance of public debate within a classroom, objective aguments, and all the joys of learning with and from others that you get from public classroom!  i know this for a fact becuase i was homeschooled for my first year of High School and it was nothing like being in a classroom full of enquisitive students! really public schools ensure that children get a well rounded education and the social experience to impliment them! plus in public schools you can be sure that the subjects will be up to common standerds and not changed to suit a parents personal ideology!<br>  <br>  you see the failing of public school is not the teachers or the government, but the parents who don't instill the drive to learn in their kids before they send them to school! i knew plenty of kids who fluncked out and it wasn't becuase the teacher didn't teach it was becuase the student chose not to learn! i Graduated with 3.0 gpa as well and top of my class at my University, so its not the schools it the students to blame for their own failures!<br>  <br>  its like Obama has been saying since his campaign, take time out with your kids at young age to read and talk about academic subjects that interest them and they will find learning more of a thrill when they get older and out into the world!|`|IJTcGIG7aa	I'm liberal - we homeschool.<br>  <br>  Your point fails, even before the weird comments about Columbine.<br>  <br>  We even teach Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky for history.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	I do not think that our education system should have to answer to the federal government..our schools should be held accountable by the parents and the community that school is in.

My friend who is a kindergarden teacher has neighbors who are homeschooled & she sees them missing out in some developmental skills, actually she is a republican...Ok, my son makes enough money to have his kids schooled anywhere he likes but when we have discussed this he says he think public school is so important. His reason is because you learn how to deal with so much more than you would at home...I agree with you. I don't even like to go out to work. I would rather work at home & not deal with a bunch of excess stuff that people need to deal with out in the world. ...we really can't judge what happened in Columbine. How do you know the same thing wouldn't have happened at a mall & they same thing would have happened to people. Most schools are very safe.
etV271ARaa	The burden of proof is on the police and the prosecution in verifying the alibi. If they dont, you will definitely be acquitted. But the police will/may be lazy and damage their own case by not checking out your alibi. If you think you're in trouble, get a lawyer. Dont tyr to represent yourself.|`|5VJbqBasaa	If you are "the accused" and have been duly charged then the police most definitely are NOT on your side and won't be nearly as keen to verify your alibi as you will be for them to do so. Therefore wherever possible you yourself, or better yet your professional defence rep(s), should try to make the facts and circumstances of your alibi as easily checked and verified as possible.<br>  If this is a pressing issue I'd strongly recommend you get some professional advice as soon as poss.

Many of the people who apply to be police have serious domination and superiority complexes but don't have much education.  It only takes a high school degree and a lot of confidence to be an entry level cop.  This type of job attracts people who want more authority than they really deserve.  It is truly scary.

The CIA and U.S government put Saddam in power and overthrew the party Iran voted for in favour of the current dictatorship because they wanted a grasp on them.  When these guys turned out to have their own countries best interests in mind the U.S had to go invade Iraq to teach them a lesson.  America wants a lot of power in the middle east which leads to destabilization and war which leads to coverage.<br>  <br>  -The establishment of Israel.  The short version is that after WWII the U.S and Britain decided to put all of the Jews in Israel in the middle of a bunch of Arab countries.  They also put it over what is now known as Palestine where people were living who don't particularly like the people of Israel that much.  After a long history of war neither side trusts the other and a lot of rich Americans that own media corporations back Israel filtering down to a pro Israel media bias filtering down to an American bias towards Israel.  <br>  <br>  -The fact that the middle east is where American soldiers happen to be stuck in conflict.  Back when the U.S was in Vietnam you constantly heard about Vietnam (way more than you heard about the middle east), it is wherever the soldiers go and Bush got the troops stuck in quagmires in Afghanistan and Iraq.|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	Because most middle east countries want nothing more than to turn the united states into a smoking crater.

We have segregated ourselves into tribes and groups since the history of time. Multiculturalism is relatively new and will always evoke mixed reactions and friction. You only have to look at the many conflicts around the world to see that, many of them could be solved by better division of land and border placement, but once they have been placed its hard to change it. We are territorial creatures which is often mistaken for racism. They are not related.

But since they only stand where they think they have a chance of winning, you are ignoring the votes in those by-elections where they didn't stand, knowing it was hopeless.<br>  <br>  So, what can we say - in their core areas, where the BNP believe they have the greatest support, they may be the third biggest party as measured by by-election results (and we know that by-elections are where people are most likely to waste votes on fringe parties.) In most of the country, they are nowhere.<br>  <br>  When it comes to a real election - such as the Euro elections in June, the BNP may make progress and may  gain a seat of two. But they won't hit 10% of the vote and they will only top 5% if there is a low turnout. Most people don't care about Euro elections and either can't be bothered, or will make a protest against an unpopular government.<br>  <br>  In the 2010 General Election, where people give their vote more consideration, the BNP will not get as much as 5% of the vote, or a single MP.<br>  <br>  Take as much hope as you want from these assorted second, third and fourth place defeats in obscure by-elections (and of course the win in Swanley).

LPO8RlVdaa	The only thing that will stop crime like this is serious punishment!!! Cautions are an absolute joke for a crime like this. If they were caught littering or being a bit rowdy walking home after a night out, fine by all means issue a caution and tell them to go home, but if they commit serious crimes they should get seriously punished!<br>  <br>  These scumbags know they can do whatever they want with impunity and if they do get caught they know their 'human rights' will allow them a lenient sentence of a cushy cell with a big screen tv, playstations, gym facilities and three square a day. Plus they'll be back out in a matter of months to do it all again. <br>  <br>  Prison NEEDS to be a punishment. It NEEDS to scare people enough so that they would do anything to stay out of it!!!|`|OIDejLJXaa	Only a small proportion of teenage criminals will respond to a caution by stopping any involvement in crime.

You are considering this as a decent law-abiding adult - it might scare you and I senseless. But young people on the fringes don't think like us. It might reinforce their self image as a 'rebel'.<br>  <br>  If a lesser step can have an impact first, it should be tried.

Included you will find links to Complaint Web Forms to be completed online and e-mail links to submit a report.

It's between her and your father, and is mediated by the court.  Once the order is in place, he has the obligation to pay for your care. (Legally, of course - he always had the moral obligation to provide for his child)<br>  <br>  I understand that you feel bad because he has problems - but they are not your fault.  A father (and a mother) should provide for their children to the best of their ability.  If he is unable to make the payments because he is not working, then it is up to him to go back to court and have the order changed.  He won't get out of paying the support money, mind you...he'll just be able to put it off for a while.<br>  <br>  You being a minor has nothing to do with the child support situation - even as an adult, you cannot step in the middle.  The money is owed by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent, to help with the expenses of caring for the child.  So no, there is nothing you can do.  I'm sorry.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	Is your mother suing for past child support payments, from the years he did not pay? If she is or has, then even after you turn 18, he still may be liable to pay.  Contact a local human/family service department, and see what exactly you can do..|`|kH0IxFa9aa	You'll be 18 soon, but he will still be obligated for the past support, which will belong to you. You can then go in and file that it be removed. Unless your mother was on welfare for you. Some welfare agency will want to be paid back for forking over funds. But if she did it on her own for you.<br>  Then you have the power.<br>  <br>  But what about the other baby's momma?<br>  He will still not get his license back because of her?|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Only one way to get out of it <br>  .<br>  Move out of your home and drop out of school<br>  .<br>  Get a shopping cart to put your things in and move in under some Expressway over pass<br>  .<br>  And learn where the soup kitchens are at and where pan handling is against the law<br>  .<br>  That way you do not exist any longer<br>  No one will know where your address is cause you ain't got one<br>  .<br>  And ya can not tell any one where you live or if you are alive or dead<br>  .<br>  And do not carry any kind of identification on you <br>  .|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I'm not sure you can.  The child support is intended for your mother to help take care of you.  However, I believe the father doesn't have to pay child support once the child turns 18, so the child support may go away on its own after your next birthday.|`|aVEVchFxaa	No. You're still a minor and your mom calls the shots. This is the first that I've seen something like this. A child wanting support payments to stop! I can kinda understand that you feel "sorry" for your father and his other family, but just think about your mother trying to raise you all by herself and on one salary if she works. That's not fair to her. He helped to make you, so he should help to support you. And you should want him to. What father wouldn't do all that he can for his child? Maybe he could get a job that doesn't require a license. My father had a weekday job, and a weekend job just so that he could provide for us.|`|eNV92pc3aa	wear a condom|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	You feel badly for him and his new family, but what about your mom? Apparently, she has been the sole supporter for you throughout your life. Your father knew about you, yet never contributed anything on his own accord. That was his choice. Theres a bigger picture than you arent actually seeing. Besides, it wouldnt make any difference if your mother stopped the child support since he still has another woman with another baby by him.<br>  Im sorry, but you cannot do anything about this to stop the child support. It is up to your mother. And since he hadnt been paying and you are already 17, he owes big in arrears. <br>  It may be possible for your father to try and get a restricted license where he can only drive for work, and thats up to him to try for.|`|U95m4LhAaa	Get one thing straight if you ever get anything straight: you did NOT cause this to happen.  Your father brought this upon himself.  Do not hold yourself responsible for the in-actions of your father.  <br>  <br>  It's pretty easy.  A person should never have any more children than what they can afford.  He helped to create you and then moved on to create other children.  He should be able to afford all the children and if he cannot and falls behind in child support payments, that is his doing.  If he was having trouble making all his expenses, he could have gone to court and asked for a modification but he chose not to.|`|mfYfeFCgaa	Your dad's wife and 3 other kids are NOT being affected by this situation because of you, they're being affected by it because of your dad. I understand you feel badly for your dad and his other family, but you shouldn't feel guilty, because you did not create this situation, HE did that. HE chose to create you 17 years ago and he chose to create his other kids as well, and he has every responsibility to help provide for all of you. Child support is a debt that he has with your mother and she is entitled to it. There's nothing you or anyone else can do to change that. The money she gets from him is to help her with raising you and providing for you and offset the expenses of your support. She is every bit entitled to that money and to be reimbursed for some of the costs of caring for you for the past 17 years and she has no obligation to forfeit that. Even once you turn 18, any support that he's owed up until that point, he is still obligated to pay and he should. If your dad wants to get his license back, he needs to take care of his responsibilities. Don't feel bad about any of this. This is something your dad owes your mom and you. Whether or not you can and will help support a child is something people should think about before they make kids in the first place
BDSC8R3Aaa	We all are, but the yanks are convinced that they bought the name of the continent for their country<br>  <br>  Hey, call me bwana, I could show you some of those whom you have never met|`|FfxmE9Toaa	We all live in The Americas.<br>  <br>  The name "Americans" comes from the time when we were a British colony and were called "the American colonist/colonials."<br>  <br>  In South America, the former Simon Bolivar Republic's cititzens were called Bolivians, and the name of the country was shortened to Bolivia.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Nope because in North America there is Canada and Mexico too and they aren't Americans.  The complete title is The United States of America, its just shorten to Americans.<br>  Central America and South America all have individual countries, like Honduras, Panama, Brazil, Chili, Peru, etc. Their country's name does not have the word America in it.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	In the broad sense, yes, but specifically the term "American", at least in English, refers to people from the U.S.A.<br>  <br>  For example, Canadians don't call themselves Americans.  <br>  <br>  The U.S.A. is the one country (and big one) in the whole group that actually uses the word "America" in its name.<br>  <br>  I'm Canadian.  I'm not going to call myself American because I know that the common usage refers to someone from the U.S.A.  Besides, "America" is an Italian guy's name, and I'm not Italian.<br>  <br>  Mexico is actually called "The United States of Mexico".  Interesting, eh?|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Technically, yes.<br>  <br>  But I've never met someone from outside the USA who calls themselves "American".<br>  <br>  And, if you travel around the world, the only people called "American" are people who are from the USA.<br>  <br>  Of course, "American" is a much more respected name than something scummy like "Mexican" or "Guatemalan" or "Costa Rican" etc. I can understand why someone would prefer to be called "American" and thus thought to be from the USA than from some smelly, worthless country south of the Rio Grande.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	No, we are not.  You're talking about different races, different languages, and different cultures.  I'm not about to walk up in some South American jungle and try to relate to some guerilla fighter by saying "Hi there!  I'm an American!".|`|0gNlwcaVaa	No, South Americans cannot claim to be USA Americans  even though many would like to.<br>  <br>  I tell you it is worse in the UK, this question tries to steal USA nationality, in the UK Indians call themselves "British"|`|7BJ0YScwaa	Duh. hahaha. Why do US citizens get so shocked when they hear this? Of course we're all Americans, we're in America! Duh! <br>  You are from a country in America called the "United States OF America". Germans and French and Slovakians are all Europeans, Canadians, Cubans and Chileans are all Americans!<br>  This should not be shocking, what's shocking is not knowing it!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh my god! Look at these answers! I thought Americans were ignorant but this obsured! Yes, people call you Americans and you call yourself Americans but it's also the name of 2 continents and anyone on them is American, they just choose not to refer to themselves as Americans because of the connotaion of them being associated with the US. Ick.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	No.<br>  <br>  Americans are from America.<br>  <br>  America is the well known short name of the United States of America. This is a name known world wide.<br>  <br>  America is only used in the name of one country in the entire world - the United States of America.<br>  <br>  This is not a difficult concept.|`|uHxfAyjBaa	The majority of Americans (North, South and Central) are embarrased and sickened by those who come from the country that lies between Mexico and Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  But the rest of the Americas is a nice place.|`|YfkkpDpAaa	Obama is the president of the USA, not Latin America, what a daft question this is.|`|AA12146958	The fact is when someone uses American they mean a citizen of the United States.  Not going to change anytime soon.|`|i98Gut3Maa	IS a French person German because thery are European..  Hell no|`|4UQegWk0aa	Yes.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	no.|`|ED0Ovjucaa	During the first and second world war soldiers in Europe and Asia when they explain to civilians where were they from always they refer themselves as Americans. This means to the other side of the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean. They always said I'm American. That is the reason because people from the United States of America (America is the whole continent name) is called by mistake “American”. But don’t worry most of the inhabitants for the rest of America know this historical issue and always we tried to call others according to the country were they born: Mexican, Cuban, Salvadorian, Colombian, Brazilian, Canadian, etc. I think the problem is the language. At least in Spanish we call people from the USA: Estadounidenses. May be in English is ok to call them American.|`|9P3uKmPlaa	Technically, yes, all people of North, Central, and South America are americans. All of us live in "the Americas". Generally speaking though, when people around the world say, "America" they tend to mean The United States of America.<br>  <br>  The French are not German, but the French, English, and Germans are all Europeans. When someone refers to Europe, are they referring to France, Germany, or Britain? They are referring to all the peoples of all of the countries mentioned above as well as all the other European countries.|`|mkGHYo0Raa	NO, you getting continents confuse with countries..<br>  <br>  only citizens of United States of American are Americans.<br>  just like only people from Mexico are Mexicans.<br>  just like only people from Brazil are Brazilians.<br>  just like only people from Costa Rica are Costa Ricans.<br>  <br>  and the list goes on|`|02ced065adfc18fe0069d330048f2b9baa	According to the ruling class, you have to be white to be an American
cWuumdy7aa	What is the doctrine of precedent? The doctrine of precedent is a form of reasoning and decision-making formed by case law. If a higher court has made a significant legal point in one case, it would be considered as binding in later courts. In order to understand this doctrine more clearly, it would be necessary to examine the hierarchy of the English Courts. The House of Lords holds the highest position, any decision made by them, would be binding to lower courts which filter down to the Court of Appeal, to the Crown Courts and County Courts. This is otherwise recognised as the doctrine of stare decisis, which means standing by what has been decided. This doctrine is a fundamental principle of English Law. The use of precedent is vital to the decision making process of the courts. In approaching a case, if the material facts coincide with those of a past...then whatever judgement given is upheld
cWuumdy7aa	India is a federal state with Cenral and state government. there was a time when one party was able to gain the majority as the opposition was weak but with regional parties coming forward due to the failure of central government no single party can think of coming to power so it has to be a coalition based on minimum common programme. today we have UPA alliance and NDA alliance and third front.. very depressing scene. looks like you will have  a hung parliament followed byhorse trading to buy MPs|`|4854FMZjaa	This is the first lesson to learn: be determined not to curse anything outside, not to lay the blame upon anyone outside, but stand up, lay the blame on yourself.

AA10690306	Rush knows exactly what he is doing.  Here he would be called a Troll because without controversy he has no show and he knows it.  The man is smart enough to hire an excellent lawyer to cop a plea deal on the drug charges and buy his way out of jail time.  He will be as outrageous as he can in order to keep his target audience ie:  Conservative Republicans and the Hard line Democrats he knows he needs to offend.<br>  <br>  His bread and butter is division and he knows it.

All they heard was "Mean old Rush wants Obama to fail!"<br>  <br>  He doesn't care what Obama succeeds at in his personal life, he just wants him to fail as president because he feels his policies are bad for the country.  If people learn early on that Obama's got no clue, then there's a chance that he won't get the support he needs to get his crackpot ideas through- AKA he fails.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Well, of course.

I did that back in November when we voted to take our country back from the nightmare that was Reaganomics. 40 years of the failed conservative agenda, maybe we are back on the right track...at least that's the feeling of the majority.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	I'm reminded of the words of one Mr. Karl Marx, from his seminal work known as the Communist Manifesto.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Karl Marx believed that the government would gain too much power, mostly through back-alley deals with various businesses and corporations; and that this would give the government the wealth necessary to screw the worker, and the business world the authority to do the same.<br>  <br>  Who let that one happen? <br>  <br>  Karl Marx then said that the workers would be unable to take this oppression, and would move toward Revolution.<br>  <br>  Who just asked for a revolution?<br>  <br>  Karl Marx said that the workers would then establish their own government "of the people." This would be a temporary situation as this government cleared out the last vestiges of the old and corrupted government. When this was done, the workers would get rid of government entirely.<br>  <br>  Who is calling for revolution, so they can return power to the people, then shrink government down to practically no power?<br>  <br>  When one country (Russia) tried to do this process as laid out by Karl Marx, what emerged was a Fascist state (that only called itself Communist); and that believed that it was its duty to spread its ideas to the rest of the world through any means necessary, even war.<br>  <br>  Who has been calling for "spreading democracy" to the rest of the world, even through war?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yet the three biggest spenders in American history were (in order from most to 3rd most):<br>  <br>  1) George W. Bush (R)<br>  <br>  2) Richard Nixon (R)<br>  <br>  3) Ronald Reagan (R)<br>  <br>  <br>  Ronald Reagan also happened to have raised taxes on everyone (except the top 1%) for the last 7 of his 8 years in office. The tax rates during Reagan's entire time in office were higher than the tax rates during the entire time Clinton was in office.<br>  <br>  The biggest expansion of government occurred in 2002, done by a Republican Congress and approved by Republican President George W. Bush (who came up with the legislation in the first place, mind you).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In every way, Republicans are following the Communist Manifesto to a T. Yet they show the same "big government" tendencies that they complain is present in Democrats, and the same "big government" tendencies that Stalin showed when he took what was to be the no-government solution of Communism into the total government control of Fascism.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So perhaps you should channel one Mr. William Shakespeare, who once said, "We have seen our enemy, and he is us."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  I am willing to resist, if the time is right.  But the only ones calling for resistance and revolution right now are the ones who caused the mess in the first place.<br>  <br>  And as I said, they are showing all the tendencies that made the Soviet Union what it was.  Things may not be so hot right now, but Clinton was able to save things when George H.W. Bush screwed them up.<br>  <br>  Reagan actually used the same tactics Obama is using now, and it worked for him.<br>  <br>  If the time to resist comes, I will.  But it has not come yet.  And even when it does, I will not be resisting alongside this current crop of Republicans.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	I think this insanity will go on for awhile longer~until even the Democrats can't get reelected~this will start in 2010 but<br>  <br>  Where is the anit war protestors? where is the anti Big Government<br>  protesters?

FUdUFJD5aa	Bingo!|`|WqReQeV3aa	yes they do because liberal people are socialist and socialist are basically communist.  They want to control everyone and how everything is spent.  And by the way bush wasn't liberal.  Obama is the most liberal socialist president we have ever had.  Doesn't even know what he's doin. He just wants to spend our money.  Raising taxes to give to the lazy is ridiculous and to everyone who is in the middle class, your taxes will be raised too because there aren't enough people in the US who make over 250,000 a year to pay for the lazy who chose not to work.  People on welfare who are truely disabled and can't work deserve it, but most are lazy.  I watched my grandmother vomit up blood for 6 years for cancer and we had to pay all her bills because she couldn't work and when she applied for welfare, no lie, they asked how much money she had in her purse.  She got her welfare in the mail the day after she died. That's bullshit but I watched everyone else walk in without proof of being disabled get approved for welfare.  <br>  <br>  So yeah liberals punish the hard working so the lazy can be rewarded and the people who need it don't get it.<br>  <br>  Bush actually got more money back to families of the poor, middle, and high class.

1YmnVk8Oaa	Beats me. I have no idea. He has literally done nothing and has the thinnest resume of any candidate ever. I feel like people think that it's the "cool" vote more than anything else. I'm a college student, and unlike what most people may believe, not all university students love Obama. However, when I ask my friends who like him why they are going to vote for them, they never have an answer. They say, "we need change," or "I hate bush," or "I think it would be good to have a black president." But that is all they ever say! I understand that some people are going to thumb me down for this, but those are the actual responses I get from Obama supporters. None of them really know WHY they are voting for him. They all just blindly believe everything he says and don't do any research on their own. I feel like if Obama said the sky was orange they would believe it. It's so ridiculous and pretty sad. I personally don't like Hillary, but Obama is a disaster compared to her. How people just ignore his relationships with racists, terrorists, etc I have NO idea. I understand that someone isn't automatically guilty by association, but I do believe that you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. If it was McCain you would never hear the end of it on here and in the media. Obama is nothing more than a self-indulged empty socialist suit.|`|9oKmNTFDaa	Obama has shown me that he is a leader and has great plans for this country. 1. health insurance. 2. a future for my kids education 3. bringing the war to an end. he has shown poise. and he stands tall on what he believes in.|`|sNWQ3qTFaa	People get so wrapped up in change they didn't notice the emperor had no clothes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  McCain Palin<br>  Better Days are Ahead<br>  <br>  |`|FXGTQkNxaa	He is a brilliant person, who truly believes in this country and restoring it to greatness.

Even though Clinton had lots more experience than Obama, it didn't matter to the far left.  Uninformed people will vote for Obama.  His shady dealing will only get shadier if he ever makes it to the White House.  Don't give up hope.  The race is still close, however the liberal media won't allow you to believe that.  Even if he wins, there will be no Mandate!   I suspect if Obama wins, he will be like Carter, a one term president!  |`|7U1CQxTdaa	He is a very intelligent and charismatic man. He speaks extremely well and his policies are not far removed from Hilary's and he is male. Whether or not that played a huge role is suspect. However, democrats in general may have felt that it is easier to get a male elected than a female. The main thing however is his incredible popularity among young people and his massive grass roots organization. Millions of people believed in what he was saying and I think Hilary's drive and boisterous attitude may have turned off some democrats. Despite what people thought Hilary is not Bill and the two may have similar policies, but their personalities could not be further apart. Obama and Bill Clinton are very similar in that regard. These are just my thoughts after following the whole process the past two years. |`|SRvCbAWlaa	I think nearly everyone is tired of having a "nitwit" as our president.

Why would a company continue to strive for excellence, expand, make innovations, etc, etc. if the people are out of work and / or can' afford the product ?<br>  Companies are in business for ONE main reason, and that's to make a profit. IF they can do this, they can hire people, or at least not lay them off. They can maintain the production, pay wages, maybe even bonus's. <br>  So here we are, in a country that has a working capitalist plan and free market, and the government is interfering with it.<br>  Look at how Ford didn't need to borrow any money yet their stock took a beating while GM went up. It didn' t seem to matter to anyone that GM was tanking, it didn't seem to matter that they took our money from government. The sad truth is, governmental interference in the free market is screwing up by handing money to the losers of our society, they are handing out money without regard to viability of the company, its pure socialism on display here....and you want to cast some aspergion onto the companies that are dealing with these blows to the economy, to their free market and market share with unfair practices of interference ?<br>  We have NEVER just "waited and seen" that Obama says. Every time that man opens his mouth i'm sure he mezmurizes those that watch him and voted for him, but he's always casting America and the economy into this BS, non-existant black and white world where we have the option of doing what he wants or doing nothing. He has never considered doing anything that worked for us when we were in a deeper recession in the 80's...he has done everything opposite that worked in history. That's not new, that's not change, and that's highly unprofessional of a president to gamble the future of America and put us higher in hock trying to force his twisted mentality of socialism to work.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	I think the second one, create global institutions of gov't to regulate.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  Restricting the flow of capital won't work because I think you need to factor in the GREED aspect, which seems to be at the root of all of society's problems.

It'll be life changing, and some may not be able to handle when they reap what they have sown.<br>  <br>  Excellent question.|`|bMymXRwJaa	A tough and complex question.

I think the solution lies in a "tit-for-tat" tariff scheme with each country, leveling the playing field -- but realistically, that is almost impossible in today's political environment.<br>  <br>  A massive campaign to drill our own oil, including shale, would be a huge source of domestic job growth.

If the paid $0.10 for every gal of oil that left the country. ( 0.10 X 50 gal per barrel X 2,000,000 barrels per supertanker) it wouldn't take long to make up the deficit and take away the reason to have oil wars.

Hear that McCain?<br>  We need more Goldwater in order to win...in order to cut the Federal bloat.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The article told you already.  You have to quit with the wars.<br>  <br>  <br>  And if you must have your war, as I do understand that SOME might be justified, then you have to pay for it instead of borrowing to pay for it.<br>  <br>  That is what Bush did with the Iraq War.  The $600 billion we were told about was only the cost of the war operations.  It did not include how much we paid to various tribes to stop killing our soldiers, nor did it include the $500 billion stimulus package that Bush gave the Iraqis (who are only 12 million people).  On top of those three items, which had already reached over $1.5 trillion, Bush paid for them with loans from other countries; at extremely high (and exponentially growing) interest rates.<br>  <br>  When Bush got to office, he inherited a $4 trillion National Debt and a $400 billion surplus in the federal budget.  When he left office, we had a nearly $11 trillion National Debt and a $500 billion deficit in the federal budget.<br>  <br>  That means for the National Debt alone, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what ALL 42 of his predecessors needed 224 years to amass.  It also means that his last budget managed to lose nearly a trillion dollars when compared to Clinton's final budget.<br>  <br>  And that was all war.  That was an unwillingness to raise the funds necessary to pay for the war.  Republicans can have cut taxes if they cut spending; problem is, they don't cut spending.  They want to spend as much as Democrats, but don't raise the funds to do so.  So they borrow the money to go gallavanting around other countries looking to take their resources (like oil), and they do so at extremely high interest.<br>  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, REPUBLICANS HAVE TO BE WILLING TO CUT SPENDING IF THEY WANT TO CUT TAXES!!|`|RDxbbCHwaa	People often use Republican and Conservative interchangeably, but they aren't specifically the same thing especially nowadays after Bush. Bush expanded the government immensely after 9/11 and we let him because we wanted to feel safe. He also dramatically increased government spending as well, which makes people like me who are conservative (but not necessarily Republican) disillusioned because we have no one to turn to. Conservatives vote Republican more often than not because in previous generations Republicans actually were conservative.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, no one in power really seems to be.|`|0RuNbOGlaa	What we really need is a Resurrection and return of the Newt Gingrich style of politics, with his "contract with America" ideas.<br>   It worked well with the Clinton administration, and stopped the run-away spending and added tax the Dems were so bent on, and helped to give the country a light at the end of the tunnel with the national debt.<br>    I know the Dems like to take credit for the economy during his years as president, but read the history and just what the dems did.<br>    The first two years of Clinton, they gave  us the largest tax increase in the history of the nation, and proceeded to spend like drunken sailors, and it took Newt and company to stop this madness.<br>    We, the republicans have to return to our core values and conservative ways, not like the Bush admninistration, and look out for the common American citizen, and despite the word to the contrary, we have to return to a "protectionist" attitude when it comes to our economy.<br>    The first obligation of any government is to the health,  welfare , and safety of it's citizens, not to worry about other nations as long as our own is in dire trouble|`|3uH441n3aa	The problem was with Bush who was really a closet liberal when it came to many social policies and spending|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Well I think a lot of the "problem" with Republicans and the Republican Party comes down to perceptions.   The things that people think we are and think we stand for, the things they think we Represent, and people have no idea what the party really is because the Republican party has come so far away from it's grassroots supporters.  Look at it like this, the Democrats and Obama wanted people to vote for them so they could change things, and that is a noble thing, but I'm hoping that we can change the way people see us and maybe a little bit of what we stand for so people can vote for us.  When I think of it like that it doesn't feel so much like there is so much of a problem with Republicans.

So, in the case of the current administration, I believe it's all about pushing through an agenda and that the economy falls somewhere next on the list.

Because they've made him the most popular talk radio host EVER, which translates to millions of dollars.  You could just as easily ask why Howard Stern is so over the top.  Because it's made him the 2nd most popular talk radio host ever, which translates to millions.  Make no mistake.  Rush is not a politician.  At the end of the day he's an ENTERTAINER.  And entertainers only get paid if they entertain.  In the political realm entertainment equates to two things: agreeing with you, and demonizing those who don't.  The more somebody agrees with you then the more entertaining they are.  Rush simply takes a complex issue, presents it as a black or white, and then attacks whatever viewpoint isn't the right color.  Anyone can do it, the trick is just to do it well.  He does it well, and it's made him rich.<br>  <br>  Why do people defend him and try to rewrite his comments?  Because the world isn't black and white, and most people realize that.  Rush may have the correct theory, but the application is lacking.  Hence people need to "clarify" an overly simplistic application of the ideology to make it more realistic.<br>  <br>  "I told you so" isn't really a question, Cassandra, but I think what it comes down to is that you've mistaken Limbaugh, a radio personality, with an actual politician.

Minutes ago I had already corrected a liberal poster who claimed that Rush made fun of Kennedy's cancer. The "rewriting" has already started from the left and will continue on for months.<br>  <br>  "Will Republicans heed the warnings concerning Rush Limbaugh?"<br>  <br>  Interesting how the left is so quick to help out with our “Limbaugh problem”. <br>  <br>  The Libs are being so selfless about the Limbaugh matter. They are trying to help us out by suggesting that if we do not listen to Limbaugh, it will be in our best interest. Thanks for your unsolicited advice Libs. I never knew, until this week, that you cared so much about the well being of the Republican party and the Conservative movement.<br>  <br>  "Before it's all over, it'll be called the Ted Kennedy Memorial Health Care bill," Limbaugh said.<br>  <br>  Thats not vile in the least. Would you prefer a memorial bridge?|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	I guess the real problem is you are assuming what Mr. Limbaugh has said is "Vile".<br>  Personally i think your dead wrong, and here's why.<br>  The simple answer is, you don' t know history.<br>  What of the 1969 incident that cost a woman her life....Ted has never really had full disclosure on that one...he just got by with it.<br>  Fast forward to Reagan compromising with the democrat congress in the 80s where he signed a 1.2 million Amnesty in exchange for building a fence on the border. Congress (democrats) took the amnesty and blew off errecting the fence. Which led to the problems we have now with immigration. Back then good ole Ted Kennedy said "this will be the last amnesty bill of its kind".<br>  Obviously that was a lie since he tried to write the new Amnesty bill in 2007.<br>  The man has in truth been no even a shadow of those that brought fame to the Kennedy name. He is known more for being a bloated politician, lying and drunk.<br>  So, with this in mind, we are to consider it offensive that Mr. Limbaugh tells a political truth wrapped in an issue which we have seen for ourselves that the democrats will push ?<br>  Have we so easily forgotten the liberal policies ? Have we forgotten Rahm Emanuels statement that "you never want to let a good crisis go to waste" ?<br>  And you wonder why there is this political "war" going on between the right and the left. The left seem to have high percentages of numb mind robots that simply won't acknowledge people, what they stand for , the statements they have made, the policies they voted for, the people they knew, and the laws they supported. It all plays into defining one's character, and the left are either too dim witted enough to remember these truths, or they are too lacking in morales to actually hold someone accountable for them.<br>  Either way, the left is no shiny pillar of hope, values, morals, ethics or American way.<br>  Sure, you can ping on some on the right for the same, which is why I think all of government needs to be turned on its head and reminded they are suppose to work for the citizens of this country, but to try a feeble attempt at bashing Rush for speaking the truth that is in front of our faces ?<br>  Just how upset did you get when Jack Mertha (democrat) called our troops "thugs and murderers" ?<br>  Or the many pieces of legislation that has ignored the American people that the left has passed without regard to what American's want ? To each complaint you can make about the right now days I could easily give you 10 the left did and went unreported or unheralded because of favoritism in the press and democrat voters just not wanting to hear it..........and if you can't face the truth, why are you complaining ? Don't see it on both sides.|`|AA12163610	I think Rush (or any conservative) could say, "have a nice day" and you and your lib friends would consider it vile.

OBL came from Saudi Arabia along with the rest of the AL-Q scum. They went to Afghanistan to fight off the Russians. The USA (Carter followed by Reagan) weaponized them and gave them logistical support. After the USSR lost tens of thousands of soldiers civil war was brewing in the USSR so they left.

Not exactly 'liberation' from al Queda and all the other lunatic warlords, but I think that's the best we can do.

The first article you reference showed over 30 percent of those incarcerated were for drug offenses, mostly non violent one's. Yeah, let's build some Buchenwald's of our own and lock 'em all up, right? Seig heil!|`|rYE9VLQdaa	As a fiscal conservative I say it is about time. In 2007 we spent almost  20 billion dollars on prosecuting marijuana cases. That is just the legal fees.This does not include the amount spent on incarceration. This drug in it's entire history has never killed one person from an overdose unlike alcohol and cold medicines. <br>  <br>  I don't want my tax dollars wasted ever.|`|tGe2jvWDaa	Obama seems to be an anarchist, as demonstrated by his disdain of hard work and our economy. He seemingly is trying to run as into the ground so fast as most Americans will soon come to despise him. Even most of those that voted for him.

Mr. Brown shouldn't feel bad, though - Obama doesn't like America either, and he is just as rude and uncouth to the American people who don't fall down and worship him! For example, using the middle finger during his campaign to rest on his face and daring anyone to call him on it (deliberately giving America the finger) , and looking side to side during the National Anthem.......<br>  <br>  But it's still embarrassing for those of us who are Americans and appreciate England and history. When obama took away Churchill's bust from the White House (which was a gift from England) and sent it back, I knew what was coming.. that he was going to show disdain for England in anyway he could.... however, that sure isn't true for the Muslim countries which he loves and by the way, gave his first, albeit, secret TV address after taking office.... he is favoring those he loves and trampling on everyone else....|`|2bx5l56caa	Its not about the quality nor quantity of the gift, but rather how its presented with attitude and respect.

Why is that, our southern border is wide open for ANYONE to cross. Do you think the Bush war machine stopped terrorist crossing, but allowed thousands of Mexicans to cross? Laughable, 9/11 was allowed to happen, just like the WTC bombing in 93 - look it up... the FBI had full knowledge of that bombing in advance before it happened. They even had an informant on the inside but decided to do nothing. They were supposed to supply fake explosives, but did nothing. <br>  <br>  God will be taken out of everything? Have you ever heard of separation of church and state? <br>  <br>  If you think Obama supports a one world government, what do you think Bush was pursuing?

After completing 14 of the courses, he enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve on 29 April 1937, as a Private assigned to Troop B, 322nd Cavalry at Des Moines, Iowa. He was appointed Second Lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the Cavalry on 25 May 1937.  On June 18 of that year Reagan, who had just moved to Los Angeles to begin his film career, accepted his Officer’s Commission and was assigned to the 323rd Cavalry.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Lieutenant Reagan was ordered to active duty on 19 April 1942. Due to eyesight difficulties, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas. His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason, California, as liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office. Upon the request of the Army Air Forces (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the Cavalry to the AAF on 15 May 1942; the transfer was approved on 9 June 1942. He was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the 1st Motion Picture Unit in Culver City, California. Reagan was promoted to First Lieutenant on 14 January 1943 and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of This Is The Army at Burbank, California. Following this duty, he returned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit, and on 22 July 1943 was promoted to Captain.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  In January 1944, Captain Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the sixth War Loan Drive. He was assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit, Culver City, California on 14 November 1944, where he remained until the end of the war. He was recommended for promotion to Major on 2 February 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year. On 8 September 1945, he was ordered to report to Fort MacArthur, California, where he was separated from active duty on 9 December 1945.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  While on active duty with the 1st Motion Picture Unit and the 18th Army Air Forces Base Unit, Captain Reagan served as Personnel Officer, Post Adjutant, and Executive Officer. By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the Army Air Forces.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Reagan’s Reserve Commission automatically terminated on 1 April 1953. However, he became Commander-in-Chief of all U.S. Armed Forces when he became President on 20 January 1981.<br>  <br>  *** I really dont see your point, Reagan was in the military, he served our country as he was assigned, not everyone in the military parachutes into battle or drives a tank, Reagan was put to work using his skills as an actor to make training films, this has been no big secret, he never tried to pass himself off as a war hero.  So what exactly is your point?|`|AA11702773	Yes, he was in entertainment/communications.<br>  <br>  Where do you think he would have served better?<br>  <br>  It is where he was sent.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	total hypocrites....Palin's daughter told Fox she was so surprised that people thought her mother would be against her having an abortion. I guess Bristol thought she was helping her mother Sarah by saying how open she was for her daughter to know she had a choice...they keep talking about dems with tax problems when we had no idea what was going on when Bush picked his staff. We have no idea what was uncovered that made Judd Gregg step down, Palin was made to pay back $7000 2 weeks ago from ripping off the tax payers but they don't bring that up.|`|BsQcplTQaa	He like several other actors at that time, made films supporting his Country, pity we don't have any actors like that now a days.

Either throw them away or keep them frozen and if no use arises, they're thrown away.  All mammals embryos are literally identical.  Chromosomal differences may exist, but there are other animals and PLANTS with 46 chromosomes.  Further people with down's syndrome have 47.  Stop killing REAL people you stupid bible thumpers.  Even Nancy Reagan supports stem cell research.|`|K8jU69SEaa	It's about time some common sense is restored to Washington.

And that is well founded, has been for a few thousand years.<br>  <br>  The asker, though, has to understand some things about people, especially Americans.  There aren't very many good history teachers in America and even fewer good history students.  Therefore the vast majority of people enter society without any concern for ideological consistency and instead focus only on their careers.   <br>  <br>  Someone like Ken Mehlman doesn't want to think, he just wants a check and to increase in power.  He doesn't think about other gay people or anyone else but himself.   One day he'll look at his wikipedia article and feel like a total putz.

THATS A BIG RED FLAG!! You need to talk with your Pastor Pronto ASAP!<br>  <br>  If the guy was really about change he would be staying well away from children and not be alone with them at anytime as so there would be in no way that he would put himself in a position where his background would be questioned in the first place.<br>   Looks like by his actions he's not at your church for change if he is hanging around small children.<br>  <br>   {I should know this stuff as I have a a lvl 3 pervert for a brother in law}<br>  <br>  Also talk with your child about good touch bad touch.|`|CowgOqXTaa	Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. <br>  (Isaiah 55:7) <br>  <br>  Why do you think this man is a danger to children?

A sex offender is someone who has committed a sexual crime to ANYONE of ANY AGE.  His conviction may have been against a person older than he is.  If the man is convicted of sexual crimes against a minor he is required by law to let neighbors know, and as a level 3 sex offender against minors he would not be allowed to live within a certain distance of any other minors.  <br>  <br>  Unless you know for sure that this mans offenses are against minors, i don't think you have much to worry about.  <br>  <br>  If however, his offenses are against minors, i would contact local police authority to make sure it is okay for him to live in that area.

Allowing Citizens to continue exercising that right doesn't require budgeting, organizing, planning or anything else.<br>  * Believe it or not, health care reform is a very complicated issue.

AA11702773	Ron Paul recognizes that the law forcibly took social security payments that might have been put into separate productive uses and that some are now dependent thereby.  He would slash the costs of empire to fund vested interests (medicare too) and to pay down debt, but would stop requiring payments from the young who are getting only the short end of the ponzi scheme.  In the current crises, while you are right that he does not think you have a right to steal from people who are productive and 'give it to a good cause', he would fund needs here over those overseas, cognizant that this way at least the money is circulating in our own economy as a stimulus and not in some other economy.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Ron Paul would not destroy social security and medicare.

I think the thing you have to remember is the politicans are just that, politicans and the economist are just tjat economist and more importantly they are human and therefore they are falliable. They certainly didn't predict this mess. So I would take them and their opinion with a grain of salt.   The second part of your question  is what Bush have to do with this question? Bush was our Commander-in Chief,our President for the last 8 years and some of this crap came under his watch not saying the previous administration did not have a hand in it....A far as politicans saying this will not work..well where were these career politicans in the last 8-12 years? There are many that are just posturing about this bill and its potential. So I wouldn't put too much stock in politicans and their opinion. It changes like the wind. This economic nightmare was a result of bad leadership, business practices, lax oversight, and consumer greed. So now America is paying the price. So unless someone comes up with another plan we are stuck with it. If you are worried about it..I'd suggest hiding your money under your mattress, in case the banks continue to fail...

Maybe if our country actually provided equal opportunities, this system would be justifiable.  However, currently children of poor families go to shabbier schools and have poorer health care than the children of wealthy ones.  Rich kids worry about which cell plan to get their parents to pay for while poor kids worry about which route home will least likely get them shot.  Socialism is needed to bring fairness back to American society.  The current economic situation should be enough proof that people are too greedy and corrupt to rely on free market capitalism to provide for all aspects of society.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Here is the thing, Socialism as it is known in the US is the British and French version, which is just terrible. <br>  Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands are extremely successful, but there is a reason for that success. They are Homogeneous. <br>  In these countries, everyone know what is expected of them, and what to expect of others. In diverse countries it is nearly impossible to get people to feel this way. You arent going to get a white guy from Buffalo and a Cuban from Miami to feel for each other, they will both have prejudiced ideas of their responsibilities and of the other. <br>  For socialism to work, we would have to lay down the law, have to make people know that they will be held to certain expectations, and make people feel that others are subject to the same expectations. <br>  <br>  So now that Ive said that, we both know that its impossible at the moment, since it requires people sacrifice for the greater good, and "liberals" want whats best for themselves, so their ideas are completely reverse of what they are willing to do.|`|pM81f5tnaa	I'm not sure whether I agree with you, but you make some interesting points.  <br>  <br>  I was curious about the immigration statistics, so I looked them up.

As a side note, out 100 hightech weapons that are developed in the world 95 out of a hundred are "american" made (as much as american cars are amercian I presume) two are swedish, one is norwegian/swedish and one is british. And we are still capable of taking out any capital in the world so I really don't think that anyone is ever going to attack us.<br>  <br>  According to several intellectual studies from certain newspapers and universities Sweden is.. "the most successful society the world has ever known", I'm quoting The Guardian ( a british newspaper) here.<br>  <br>  Oh and this link has to sting quite a bit <br>  <a href="http://www.vexen.co.uk/countries/best.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vexen.co.uk/countries/best.ht...</a><br>  and yes ofc the immigration is higher in the US..

PRQ7ryOWaa	Liberalism prevails in HS and college because most of the teachers have gone from being students to teaching, never living in the real world. Without real world life experience, teachers like their students, are idealists, who see the world as it should be instead of how it really is.... <br>  <br>  Teachers prey on idealistic, inexperienced students, they manipulate them with emotional issues like abortion and evils of capitalism.  <br>  <br>  The things they teach you in school- <br>  1) American Indians are the rightful owners of America, the capitalists stole their land and have no rights to America (even today).<br>  2) Every child in school has been taught the most important issue of their lifetime is "green politics", the environment.<br>  3) Abortion- teachers get get kids to go to the dark side, pushing their emotional buttons about abortion, scaring them to think that liberals must rally to prevent the evil capitalists from over-turning Roe vs Wade.<br>  4) Teachers hate God, especially at the college level. <br>  <br>  Like the media that is 90% permeated with far-leftist, so are our colleges, universities and high schools. The teachers union is one of the strongest groups backing the democratic party, full of far-left extremists. <br>  <br>  If you are not aware that schools are permeated with far-leftists, you probably are in denial that Hollywood is too as is the media. <br>  <br>  Schools are the breeding grounds for creating liberalism, most students affected eventually figure out, later in life, liberalism is a mental disorder; socialism doesn't work and Joe McCarthy was right.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	The government (department of education) decides what is taught in public schools, not the parents or the community.

I'm a teacher and believe me, I have more than enough to do sticking with the program as it is.  Now my class is composed of what you could call 'the sweat hogs'...if you remember that old TV show, Welcome Back, Cotter.  I teach math and reading.  Believe me... as there's no atheists in foxholes, there's no politics in math.  'Reading' is a bit different.  After all the phonics is over you have to actually read.  My class just finished Animal Farm and 1984.  Yeah, we discussed politics and history and propaganda and yes, we related all of that to the current situation.  I always make certain that my opinions are called exactly that...opinions, but objective reality isn't 'opinion'.....it's fact!  Propaganda isn't fact.  If right wing radio 'entertainers' say the 'public schools teach XY and Z and it's not true, that's propaganda.  If they call people 'socialists' and that's not true, that's propaganda.  If they wave the flag and shake the cross to make a point and indulge in ad hominum, strawman and red herring and false choice arguments, that's propaganda.  Yeah..I tell my kids all of that and demonstrate it by reading articles and picking out the logical fallacies.  That's education.  If the reactionary right doesn't like it, hard cheese for them.  I'm a teacher....I teach...do me something!  No kiddin'!|`|9HRkwzruaa	Really.<br>  <br>  I'm a public school teacher's kid, but my son is homeschooled due to health and academic issues.  (He has a lowered immune system and can't be around all the illnesses that go through a school with 1200 kids in it, and he tests as off-the-charts gifted and even the private schools in the area have admitted they have no clue what to do with him.)  I teach private classes for homeschool kids and work in other venues with both ps and hs kids.<br>  <br>  Yes, they teach gay marriage, Islam, and sex ed as young as elementary; yes, they teach kids that being "tolerant" means never showing any Judeo-Christian values or Biblical knowledge (for fear of "offending someone"); and yes, they teach kids who they should vote for and why.  (Funny, every Muslim person I've ever met thinks it's absurd that Americans would shove their religious beliefs to the background in order to not "offend" them.  Observant Muslims live every aspect of their lives according to their beliefs and really don't care if someone else doesn't like it.)<br>  <br>  What I have seen a distinct lack of in ps students is kids who can think through a situation from different sides, kids who can examine various theories and decide for themselves what they believe, and kids who are fine with respectfully showing who they are even if someone else doesn't see things the same way.  Many jr. and sr. high school ps students don't know what a "primary source document" is or that they should read them, but openly and actively believe what their teachers and textbooks say.  They've been raised to do so.  The answer I get whenever I question one of them, from K up through 12, is "my teacher said that...".  Still think there's no indoctrination?  (You're right - they don't teach regular marriage.  They do teach about gay marriage, though.)<br>  <br>  Do all schools do this?  Of course not.  Do all teachers do this?  Of course not.  Does it happen?  You bet your booties it does...I've been told about it by both students and teachers.<br>  <br>  And as for Red states being less educated than Blue states...perhaps you didn't check out the exit polls this year?  Red states showed a much higher education level, on average, as compared to voters from Blue states.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you're wrong on this.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	The claim is an outright lie. By a "pro gay agenda" they mean that schools allow gay children to come out and form their own groups. To suggest that American schools are anti-American is wildly off base. The American history I was taught ignored AA until the Civil War and passed over all the atrocities against Native Americans as if they never existed. In reality the school boards are controlled by people who are very afraid to disturb parents. American schools are not anti-Christianity. I am, vehemently, but in school Christianity is always portrayed as a civilizing institution, despite the Crusades, the Inquisition, the many religious wars in Europe, Europe's perpetual persecution of Jews and so on. These same schools give scant treatment to the Reconstruction period, another shameful episode in American history.<br>  .Highly educated people tend to be more liberal. This is why professors often do offer a liberal view of history.

Your lucky. My friend has two children in the 2nd and 3rd grades. When Obama got elected, all they did was talk about how wonderful of a president Obama was going to be. How he would make things better than they were the last eight years. How everyone would get to keep their homes and have health insurance. That rich people would pay more taxes so poor people would have nice things. Yes the teachers actually said this. They were also suppose to write a short story of why they like president Obama.

In other states they are more selective with the test and the results. And some teachers, everywhere do have a tendency to push their beliefs on others. Good teachers don't. I saw more prejudice and pushing of their ideals in the north. I have been to many schools north, south, west, and I have to say the south is so underrated.

But, I've never seen anyone use 3 million as an estimate.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	actually i had understood it to be (counting all ethnicities)to be between 20-25 million persons in this country.I am concerned about them being here,but as the economy keeps going into the toilet,im pretty sure some of them will be starved out.
ahWSLsC9aa	Most if not all states require that you become certified in basic law enforcement training (BLET).  It is generally a 6 month program offered at community colleges.  (This is for local law enforcement agencies.)  Once you work for the state or federal government in a law enforcement capacity, then you will need a four year degree.  Prior law enforcement or military experience is recommended.|`|uSeApMt9aa	Depending on where you are you would most likely need to be a war vet to get on the police force. 20 years ago it was a little different now everyone wants to be a cop. Military will get 1st pick on civil service before anyone. Then minority ( Hispanic, African American, women ). If you do live in a civil service community and don't want to join the forces then i would say no. If you want to join the military then i say yes. If your community isn't civil service then YES join. Its an opportunity of a life time.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	No! Become part of the solution not part of the problem!

You have to meet some very high standards, go through the hiring process, and then you may be offered a job.<br>  <br>  No, everyone does not want to be an FBI agent.  I have more arrest powers, make more money, and see more action in a week than most feds do in 6 months.<br>  <br>  I could easily get hired as federal agent.  I have the military experience with a TS clearance, a 4-year degree, a clean background, and a few years law enforcement experience.  But I choose to stay where I'm at because of the above listed reasons.<br>  <br>  It's not like they portray it in the movies.|`|K2ecmzInaa	If you want to join the CIA or FBI, you'd be better off going to the military first. <br>  <br>  Everyone wants to be an FBI agent.

2ecc2d05da3ecf7036e0cae86c8cf3f8aa	Here is a little something to think about.<br>  <br>  Can a capitalistic system, which requires an infinite amount of resources and materials really work on a planet/world, that only has a finite quantity of materialas available?<br>  <br>  To answer your question directly: Yes we need a radical change. Capitalism is not holy or special, it′s just the system thats worked ok for a few million people (while it hasn′t been ok for the majority of the planets inhabitants, but who cares about others, right?) and a set period of time. But now we need the courage to come up with a new system, that works for the 21. century|`|e6939e2c550152ccd357282adb355721aa	The first responder is clueless giving no facts.

The powers that be have planned it this way. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Few people in the United States know this because of the unquestioning media, propaganda, and jingo-isms , among other things. <br>  <br>  <br>  I could write an encyclopedia set that proves that capitalism is an abysmal failure and has caused over 300,000,000 deaths in the last century or two alone.<br>  <br>  Of course...most Americans have no idea what I'm talking about and will probably give me thumbs down.<br>  <br>  <br>   I feel sorry for your ignorance(people that give me thumbs down) you are under the illusion of liberty...yet you cannot see how enslaved you really are.|`|AA10152346	Yes. Take a look at the Post carbon Institute and this book:<br>  <br>  Richard Heinberg's<br>  <br>  The party is over:Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.richardheinberg.com/partys-over.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.richardheinberg.com/partys-ov...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Responder "Obama cut the Cheese" is the one that has no clue.<br>  <br>  First responder and many others are totally right. Resources are finite, growth based on such is by necessity also finite.<br>  <br>  just one example on the loss of life and poverty that capitalism has caused look at the accumulation of the original capital how natives were treated in the Americas (I refer to the whole continent) it's estimated that at the time the first Europeans came to the continent there were 70 million people living here. By the time countries started getting their independence the native population had dwindled down to 3 million. Deaths caused by sickness, mass extermination and exploitation of the natives by the Europeans. You can find more on this on the book The Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano.|`|adb009bb7026fa990c0936cae97cb432aa	I personally see two really big problems with capitalism in its current incarnation.  One is that in a deregulated environment, people have been allowed to use leverage to an excessive amount such that a partial collapse in one area can pull the whole house of cards down.  This is exactly what happened during the Great Depression.  (in conjunction with erosion of middle class purchasing power, sounding familiar).  The second problem is allowing the formation of oligopolies.  If you are too big to fail, then in a truly capitalistic environment, you have gotten too big.  The problem is that we don't have true capitalism.  It is actually oligopolies.  It is only the excessively greedy who need to feed that constant increase.  Most investors are pleased with consistent regular returns.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	Yes we're always worried about economic growth.  Without continuous growth the country will fail.  There seems no such thing as a stable and sustainable economy.  Anyone, even with little respect for math, can realize that growth cannot continue into infinity.<br>  <br>  We really must begin to struggle toward sustainability in all aspects of our gift of life here on Earth.|`|AA11042510	You can thank Bill Clinton for sending many jobs overseas.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	I agree with you 100%<br>  <br>  Material goods aren't spiritual.

c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	Tons of inmates in solitary and that have been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole try to commit suicide! To me I would want to die instead. To me the life without parole sentence is stupid and a waste of taxpayers money! Just give them the death penalty and carry it out swiftly. It would save billions in tax payers money. It costs around $45,000 dollars a year to keep each inmate in prison. That sadly, is more than some families make in a year. I think we could find a better way to spend that money. The American "JUSTICE" system is a joke. It is nothing more than a business. What is the purpose of a business? To make money. It amazes me that the prison system is one of the fastest growing and strongest businesses in America today. There are over 7,000,000 people in prison in the U.S. today you do the math.|`|NXujuDxnaa	I'd rather take death.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most horrific criminals should be placed in complete isolation for life...

A lot of people comment about politics and politicians being corrupt but none is willing to enter it to clean it up. It is upto the people of India to clean up and raise the level of Indian politics and politicians. Join a cadre based party like the BJP unlike the Congress which is a Nehru Dynasty.

8OmL54xoaa	Well, I for one am a Puerto Rican and I can go back there anytime that I have enough money to pay for my plane or boat ticket. Nobody there likes OBAMA, well perhaps our crooked governor who is one of OBAMA`s buddies. But Governor Acevedo-Vila`s days as governor will end soon, in fact he may be going straight to jail for appropriating unreported campaign fund donations for his personal use. Probably learned about how to do that from Obama, the only difference is that he got caught with his hands in the cookie jar. But take heart, our nation is made up of much stronger fiber than OBAMA, we have survived worst things and come out of it stronger. OBAMA is just another "pain-in-the-rear-end" politician, they just come when we let them and go when we tell them "HIT THE ROAD JACK". Besides if he is planning a hostile takeover you better believe it that we are going to bring out those guns that we cling to and bring down the wrath of God around his pretty black and white or white and black little head. And our God is the real deal, not that ALAH demon that the Moslems worship. If he pushes the button for an American Argammedon, he is going to get one and he will lose. Well, he still may not be the regular Anti-Christ that the Bible prophesies about, but if he is shot in the head and survives, bring out lots of toilet paper, get on your knees and pray to God Almighty, even if you`re an Atheist, dust-off your Bibles and read it, pray to God for protection and deliverance, read the books of Matthew and Luke, repent from your heart of your sins and receive Jesus into your heart and prepare yourself for the Rapture. Because if you stay behind down here on planet earth, all hell is going to break loose. By the way if your repentance and acceptance of God is not legit, you will not be in the Rapture ride, you will stay down here on planet Earth. Hopefully you and whoever else stays down here will have enough sense to join the Remnant, or else the ENEMY will brand you with his number and you will become his servant. Let`s pray that now is not the time, but remember that God`s will, will be done here on planet Earth just as it is done in the heavens. You and the rest of mainland Americans are more than welcome to our island, Puerto Ricans still love to open up their homes to all kinds of strangers and there are plenty of beaches where you can camp at. Please make sure that if a bunch of you mainland Americans move there to camp out on the beaches, bring along lot`s of Port-a-Potties and keep the beaches clean. A lot of us care enough for free, clean beaches; so don`t go there and try to appropiate the beaches or you will bring down the wrath of Puerto Ricans on your heads and believe me these natives down here can put up with a lot of s!!t but when that s!!t hits the fan and they get angry, just get out of their way because they can really loose it at times.

And, I know if I saw something like that happen to either one of my boys I would be a ripped as *ell.<br>  <br>  If in doubt, call the police department and ask someone what your rights are.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this works out for you, your boyfriend and your mom.|`|mldo1vxYaa	If he has been abusing you then the police can proceed with a case if they have evidence regardless of what you say as most abuse victims do not press charges but as you say there is no abuse and it was an accident then the police have no evidence and neither does your mom, its her word against his and yours so there is nothing to worry about.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	no she cant.<br>  However you might want to look at it this way. Did he stop right after and get all lovy and appolegetic? or did he just walk away knowing he hit you? if he just walked away then im sorry lady, you got smacked.|`|4tEkm4T0aa	if she has a plausible reason to do so, than yes.<br>  no matter what age either of you are, she can if the court sees that she had a good reason (the breaking of a law basically)|`|Tv0D5y9Waa	No, since you are the one who got "hit", you have to be the one press charges.  If you were minor, she could press charges.|`|ML3PGUPYaa	yes, you can press charges for basically anything these days....however if you testify against your mom than she will fail|`|iIiRVexbaa	She can call the police and if they find reason, the state can press charges without your consent.

So if your mother calls the police and the officer shows up, the officer will ask you, did this happen.  You can say yes or no.  Then, he will ask, do you wish to press charges.  If you say NO, the officer has no choice but to leave.<br>  <br>  At this point, your mother has no say in the matter.  You are an adult.

Deal with it and use it as a learning experience, not as criminal thinking of trying to get out of something  you did! You are lying...and little things lead to big things.  Just be honest and tell your parents you were smoking ... it is not like you murdered someone.  Tell them you did and tell them your sorry and it will mean more to know you have morals and want to be honest with them, than to have them find out later by smelling it or finding out later and not trusting you again.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Don't lie, especially if you think they might have you on tape.

Try quitting, and you can avoid this.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	The tobacco gestapo is upon you, Herr Joey.|`|AA11909745	A smoking ticket? wow I did not know they even had those anymore.<br>  <br>  I suggest you find out by calling the local Clerk of the Court what the fine is for this, and they will let you know. What ever you do do not lie to the cops, that will only make it worse because they might have video of you or a witness (one of the other cops there) that will say he saw you smoking. And then if you lied and said you did not you would be convicted of lying to the Judge, which can actually put you in Jail for a while. So find out what the fine is, get the money together and ask the court if you can just pay the fine and get it over with.
YxQRC8q0aa	The American Democratic system would be great (thats the one I would use) for it controls power of government and gives opportunity.

It's cheaper to buy food then to grow it yourself, now.  Of course  my theory is farmed food is less healthy and is one of the reason for obesity.|`|CEiyYCqaaa	Generally bills are long and have various hidden agendas porked into them.<br>  <br>  This case being if you have to buy genetically modified fruits and vegetables from a corporation then you're forced to buy from someone each season.

yAsLhdp2aa	Good Job...<br>  <br>  --Since we have freedom of religion in this country, it is unconstitutional for 1 group of religious people to take away the rights of another group of people.  The constitution was written to protect individual rights, not group rights.  Religious dogmas based on fear and the unknown should not dictate what another individual is free to do in a free society upon free will.<br>  <br>  As the Libertarians say...do whatever you want when you want to, as long as it does not hurt anybody else.|`|Gxuw0Gz6aa	good job|`|jlgfkyrEaa	The Constitution was written by the people for the people and it has had several amendments to it since its inception. Most of the amendments were put to a popular vote and this is how they got amended. <br>  <br>  The Citizens of California voted on this legislature and decided that it was just by  a slim margin thereby  the court must uphold the popular vote based simply on the fact that this is what our principles of government are.<br>  <br>  Additional info:<br>  <br>  To use your phrase <br>  Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness". Why not let me have my happiness if it doesn't interfere with yours?<br>  Then what would be the harm of letting those who use drugs and or sell them go ahead and do it. It is their pursuit to happiness and those who are using aren't interfering with yours.<br>  The popular vote on this was to make it illegal and thereby it is. This is the way some laws are are they unjust yes in some cases but this is the way of a democracy
vN2PUynoaa	Well i think it is a story as old as time, they want their man in so they are going to hate on people who is not for them.|`|OJIZQYDcaa	Bush added $5 trillion to the national debt, squandered a $5.4 trillion surplus, he started a $1-$3 trillion Iraq war, $700 billion was given to a bunch of idiot banks, hundreds of billions was given to other companies, but those situations didn't get as much publicity as the Bank bailout, yet he almost completely ignored the American people which is why this country is in the mess it's in.<br>  <br>  Not once did he try to do anything about gas prices and as a result people couldn't pay for their house and gas at the same time. People chose gas because they need it to get to work.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	The war in Iraq was unnecessary.  The recent collapse of the economy make the stimulus bills necessary, supposedly.|`|f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	I got a Democrat to admit this, but it took me an hour.   In Keynesian economics, it doesn't matter what we spend as long as we spend money to get us out of the recession.  Military is just as good as building roads or even better.  In military spending, there is a greater assurance that the money is returned back to Americans.   Soilders, defense contractors and such.   In building road, international trade agreement is being used to force us to buy outside the US.   England and China is right now using these treaties to leaverage Obama to buy outside the US.   What youa re actually seing is corruption.   They don't care about keynesian economics and only use it for their own selfish gain.   They want the money relocated to their friends pocket books.  THis can be seen by their behavior.  In one ahd they say we need to spend more money to create jobs, but they turn around and layoff government employees.  This shows that they are not stimulating the economy but relocating the money.  Obama is even doing it.  ALthough I think he is being manipulated, But he is trying to cut waste.  Waste is jobs.   According Keynesian ecomics you avoid these streamlining actions until the economy improves.    As for Bush and Clinton, They were both practicing Keynesian economics inappropriately.   They were using it to prevent a recession.  Reagan warn that it would be disasterous to do that.  We need to use Keynesian economics only after a recession has started.  I really wish Obama would pick up an economics book rather relying on his advisors, especially since they are Goldman Sachs men.   <br>  <br>  PS, I don't think Keynesian economics would get us out of this recession, because it got us into it.   What I am saying is Obama and other Democrats are violating the tenets of Keynesian economics despite the fact they are saying they want it instituted.   I also don't think Obama is corrupt, but I think he feels rushed by people around him and is making mistakes doing so.  He was the one who got key Democrats to switch votes to get the first bail out passed, despite warning that they lack proper safeguards and the money would get squandered.   That Congress needs time to review it.   He now admits that the first bail out is a disaster.   Obama's mistake is that he do before he thinks.<br>  <br>  Edit:  They guy I spent an hour explaining Keynesian economics said something similar to the guy above.   I don't understand where do liberals get the idea there was ever a Surplus.   He keeps insisting there was some surplus during CLinton, even though are national debt always climbed.  It only slowed durign the Clinton administration, which is a very bad thing according to Keynesian economics.  According to Keynesian economics, we needed o start paying back on the debt when our economy is good.   That never happen.   These distortion of the truth is what is destroying our country.   We don't want Enron/ Arther Anderson accounting , that the CLinton era is famous for, to occur while we are trying to fix our economy.

tROFU72waa	IDK!  You really live up to your name dude, cause you have no clue.<br>  <br>  All four branches have elite forces within their own branches.  <br>  The US Army has SFOD, commonly known as Delta as well as the Rangers and Special Forces (Green Berets).<br>  The US Navy have their SEALs.<br>  The US Chair Force have the finest Search and Rescue boys in the world knows as ParaRescue (PJ's), as well as CCT's and TaCP's.<br>  The United States Marines, aside from being considered the Elite Infantry, aslo have the newly formed Marine Special Operations Command.<br>  <br>  If you mean just walking around day to day life, then I'd say the Marine Corps would have the title of toughest branch. That being said, there are a few organizations within the Army that are right there with them ie. 82nd Airborne.  The Marines train every Marine to be a rifleman first, then to do their chosen occupation, that means a lot to us who have seen the soft skills in the other branches.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	The Marines|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Tough as in basically would be Marines but they all have different jobs and special ones.<br>  Air Force has CCT and PJs and PJs training (called "Superman School") is the hardest in the military.<br>  Navy has it's SEALs and DEVGRU.<br>  Army has it's Rangers and SF as well as others.<br>  Marines have their "green" and "black" Force Recon and their Scout/Snipers.<br>  <br>  They all have special parts about them. I met a guy who was Navy and then Marines and he said SEAL training and Force Recon training were both hard, slightly different but not harder than each other.. just in different ways.<br>  It's so very pointless to compare as they all do a certain job and are the best hands down at it. Dean M is right, they are all equals and while they jest, they all respect each other. They are all players for the same team working TOGETHER to achieve the same goal: defend the USA.|`|AA11142677	COAST GUARD while other branches may be tougher on a day to day basis  the guard goes out every day out gunned by drug runners.<br>  into hurricanes to save lives, when all other branches have been stood down. breaking ice to either free trapped ships or to open a navigable channel to remote and isolated ports.  all with outdated equipment cast off by the other military branches as obsolete.<br>  then you need to consider the fact that this isn't exactly a military branch as it is an extension of the department of transportation on permanent loan to the"military" on an "as needed" basis usually getting the worst jobs that the military doesn't want to do.<br>  while all branches have my thankfulness and respect special thanks from me go to the Guard.|`|mr8isJoZaa	Completely equal and waste of time to argue this point.

That said, I'll stick with my answer: USMC & USCG|`|o6IiYw6baa	MARINES ARE BY FAR THE BEST AND TOUGHEST BRANCH OTHER MILITARY.......... even tho they r not a brach of the military, they r a department of the navy|`|7idyT7Obaa	depends.<br>  are you talking, physical or mental?<br>  basic training or on the job?<br>  standard service members or specialized units?|`|IpQsjbtWaa	the SASr bloody tuff they are the original special forces

AA11672256	Even without a legislation, certain sections of police have made wonderful contributions in this regard. I shall cite only one instance. The police of South 24 Parganas in West Bengal made arrangements for loans from banks to rehabilitate the male members of a village notorious for its association with crimes like robbery. The reformed robbers are now honest, law abiding citizens, leading a peaceful life. They have broken all associations with their notorious past for good. I agree with you that a suitable legislation in this regard can only lead to an all round improvement of society.

If John McCain can concede with class then so can the rest of you.  Obama kept asking all throughout his campaign if American was "ready."  I didn't understand what he was actually talking about until McCain's concession speech last night.  Is American ready for an African American President?  If we weren't, Obama wouldn't have won the election.  He understands that.  Always has.  I don't think he believes he's "owed" anything just because of the color of his skin.  If you had actually followed the campaigns you might have actually learned something about minorities in the 21st century.|`|SRvCbAWlaa	It's sad to see so many narrow-minded morons in this world.

Those are the presumed sentences for most felonies, although the guidelines can differ based on the offender's past criminal history, the likeliness that the offender will return to a life of crime, and other factors that the judge will consider in a trial.

K2ecmzInaa	You'll most likely get community service and a fine. Then again, I don't know how hard your local prosecutor is on this specific issue. Needless to say, a curfew for summer may be the least of your worries.|`|IvpURwBkaa	You won't need a curfew with the amount of community service you'll be doing. You'll be so tired by the end of the day the only thing you'll want to do is sleep. Get what you can out of it, you could learn some good work ethic.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with the charges, but that's what you're looking at. Good for you for sticking up for your old man.|`|lcNQ2w57aa	You're just going to be fined and have probation for a year (most likely). No community service needed. Just stay out of trouble for the year. They may also take awya your license until your 21 but not all states do this (even though you weren't driving, just another one of those "under 21" laws they have).

If you were deemed suitable you would actually get paid for his keep and he would still have the care of his social worker.    This would be a better option than trying to remove him through the courts.|`|YUJWfeMoaa	It basically means that he is free of any legal gardian.

He was telling how people have died at that intersection. Well, obviously it needed to be fixed if it was that big of a problem<br>  <br>  He said he had my plate number and was calling the cops. I told him to do it and even gave him my name and number. They never called me.<br>  <br>  Point is, the police have to see the driving infraction. So even if what you did was not correct, it's that's person word against yours. Now if you hit that persons car, or caused them to wreck....then that is different.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	You are lucky the driver wasn't in a violent mood.  People have been know to get killed because of traffic issues.<br>  <br>  The police won't do anything about the violation because they did not witness it.

Can you wait for 5-6 hours for the next available officer?"|`|bEynoNf6aa	Don't admit to anything.  It's your word against his.  Most cops probably would think it was insufficient evidence.  At any rate, an illegal pass is such a minor offense that I'd doubt they would care.

The police would listen to the guy complain, to see if there was any laws broken worth enforcing. Then they would look to see if you had any warrants out for you. If not, then nothing should happen. If you have warrants, though, you better turn yourself in, because they're on their way.|`|RfTZq7VMaa	Find where he lives and call the police on him, also throw on a wifebeater t-shirt while your at it, intimidate him.|`|huWmgztQaa	Well he most likely won't call them and there is not much he can do if there is no proof or you didn't damage his car

Therefore, it would be illegal to carry such a knife concealed, and only openly if you have a plausible and legitimate reason (self-defense does NOT count).

I personally disagree with both.  The difference, though, is that smokers hurt others with their smoke, whereas an overweight person hurts only themselves; at least physically speaking.<br>  <br>  But as I said, while I disagree with both taxes (should they ever come to fruition), niether one has been suggested by Obama.  So why the attack?|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	I think that they should not tax anyone for anything. The government should be smarter and find better ways to make money.

They should find something to sell to the public rather than just taking things from us!|`|8GDd6lrnaa	what about fat smokers, they will be double taxed|`|RDxbbCHwaa	I don't smoke and I'm not fat, but I do not see the logic in charging people who do or are for their particular vice of choice. It's easy for politicians to do so because smokers have been marginalized by society over the last several decades. The reason? The rest of the population doesn't like smoke. And when you can't stand that people choose to do something they have every right to do but you don't like it, you work towards making it illegal. The anti-smoking lobby's ultimate goal I'm sure is to make smoking illegal, and they do it slowly first by restricting when and where you can do it and taxing you more to do it. Then one day, 30 years or so later, you wake up and cigarettes are illegal.<br>  <br>  I'm sure they could do the same for fat people, and really all of us, by taxing high fructose corn syrup and other such, under the happy friendly guise that the money will be used to fund child health care or something. What heartless person would disagree with that, right? This is how they get you.<br>  <br>  We have a right to make choices in the USA and even if I have no interest in choosing to do what you do, I want you to be able to choose.

Taxing tobacco is just another way to eventually eliminate it.   Many states have already banned cigs from any public building or workplace.  <br>  I have a hard time understanding how it can be constitutional for a state to ban smoking in a restaurant or a bar.  There are modern ventilation systems that can be installed that are good enough that you would never smell a cigarette being smoked the same table with you.   Yet in many states, even if a restaurant were to install one of those systems, it could not allow smoking even if the restaurant only allowed people 18 and over, and advertised as a smoking restaurant.  I will also not, that many restaurants like chili's and applebee's (with bars) in some small cities in Louisiana and Arkansas have had dramatic declines in business on weekend night because of smoking bans.   A few years ago, some of that type restaurants would have hour long waits for seating on saturday nights, and after the bans, are seldom more than 3/4 full on weekends.   And many of those restaurants like that make a large portion of their income from alcohol sales, so they are taking a huge hit by losing the smokers who liked to come in and drink and smoke and socialize.|`|lsuT5whmaa	I think they should TAX CRIMINALS!

First of all, I don't want anything from the government except for it to leave me alone.  I want to keep my gun, I like my truck (liberals want us to all drive Priuses), I want them to drill in ANWR (I'm from Alaska), I think cigarette taxes are way to high -- I shouldn't have to give 2 bucks to the government every time I buy a pack of smokes, and I'm pro-life.  I'm just not into hugging trees, drinking lattes and being a vegan.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	I vote Republican because that's where my beliefs go.  I don't believe in killing babies for sport or because of a moment of irresponsibility.  'We had sex and now I'm pregnant.  Gee, how'd that happen?" <br>  <br>  I don't believe in gay marriage  Straight people can't marry another straight, or animal.  Why should gays get additional rights?<br>  <br>  We should not pander to terrorists.  Democrats i.e. Obama thinks we need to make nice with people that want to kill us, or would love to see us dead.  In fact many people think we should not defend ourselves because any attack on our soil means, "we deserved it."<br>  <br>  Republicans don't demonize the soldiers in our military.  They have been given a duty, and they should not be accused of crimes, by our government, for doing what the government told them to do. <br>  <br>  Illegal aliens should not get a free pass to goods, services, and benefits that legal immigrants, and citizens could never get-- but have to support.   <br>  <br>  I don't think people who intentionally don't want to work should get some kind of reward.  I don't think people who do work, should be punished with extra taxes.  And business owners and other-on-paper wealthy* who drive this economy should be the ones taken care of, since they're the ones who give the rest of us jobs.    <br>  <br>  Obama's way is to punish the very people that can help.  *His definition of "rich" is people who make $250,000 a year.  On paper, a person may indeed appear quite well off.  But his business takes a lot of money to run, taxes, of course, building maintenance and lot payments or rent, payroll, buying supplies, shipping goods, utility bills which can run into the thousands during winter, etc.  So when it's all said and done, this "rich" person takes home about $30,000 a year.   And that's probably taxed as well. <br>  <br>  So I will remain a Republican or vote Independent if nothing turns up.  But I'm not wasting my vote on someone who isn't going to win anyway.  I will be voting to oust the incompetent boobs in office who are taking this country down.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	Some in both parties tend to go to extremes.  I used to think like you that most people who are Republicans are voting against their own interests.  As I aged I realized there has only been one good Democratic president in my lifetime and I'm over 60.  Kennedy might have done alright had he been able to finish his term but we'll never know that.  No president seems to do well when their party has the majority in the house.  They tend to go overboard and don't keep themselves in check.

aVEVchFxaa	That's really a hard one. I think that it depends on the individual case.

But Obama and Bush are under very different corcumstances. Bush inherited a relatively strong economy (compared to today's) and a fiscal surplus from Clinton's time. <br>  Obama on the other hand has inherited a mess. A rapidly collapsing economy and huge fiscal deficits from Bush.<br>  <br>  In this case, most economists agree that Obama needs to spend big in order to 1) stop the collapse of huge firms which would cause even more devastation on an already weak economy, and 2) stimulate the creation of new jobs and economic activity.<br>  <br>  Bush didn't need to do that, as witnessed by his willingness to cut taxes of the already fabulously wealthy, at the same time increasing his own spending.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	I really think this question deserves to be answered by the head of the GOP, Rush Limbaugh.

Our economy is going through a huge valley, a significant depression, due to the failings of Reaganomics and the incompetence of Bush.<br>  <br>  Increases in spending NOW will result in jobs, which will create revenue that largely pays for those spending hikes.   The alternative is to let the valley go very deep (major job losses) and both lose that revenue (tax income) AND pay out unemplloyment/etc benefits.    <br>  <br>  So, just like Laffer Curver proponents argue about tax cuts 'saving' money - spending now actually can SAVE us money.<br>  <br>  FWIW....each TRILLIION spent adds about 40 Billion to the annual budget going forward, since no debt is cheaper than government debt.   Less than 40 Billion (future) dollars is a small price to pay to soften what's going to be a tough downturn.<br>  <br>  Now, if you really want to complain about things....complain about debt racked up during GOOD economics times....like Bush did.  Clinton handed him a 230 BILLION DOLLAR surplus, but that became a deficit in the first year.   Bush ran multiple record deficits thanks to his tax cut hand offs to the wealthy.   300 BILLION federal tax dollars goes to paying Interest on debt ran up under Bush....every year.  <br>  <br>  ..............<br>  <br>  Finally.....on the WSJ article.   It's mostly concerned with Obama's budget....and BOO HOO.   Times have changed.<br>  <br>  We now have a government that serves MAINSTREET first and Wall Street gets the trickle down.

It turns out they were lied to therefore, and the govt (passed and present) are in breach of that contract.<br>  <br>  26 member states were denied ANY referendum on the EU, and 2 states that did have a referendum (Denmark and Sweden) voted against the EU. That tells us something, that the Govt are sh1t scared to give us a referendum because they just know we'll vote to pull out. UKIP is trying it's best to discredit and show the EU how corrupt it all is.

Ca8i226Xaa	Here is info from ALIPAC about the events in the Senate yesterday. <br>  <br>  Here is what we believe happened to the best of our knowledge. <br>  <br>  1. On Thursday morning, Senator Durbin circulated an Amendment to Senate Bill 160 (S.160) which was the bill to consider statehood for the District of Columbia. While Senator DeMint's office received the Durbin amendment around 9:45am Eastern, Durbin did not officially file the amendment (S.AMDT.591) till later. <br>  <br>  Senator Durbin's bill would give the FCC greater authority and assuring "diversity" in local radio markets and would thus be able to force many market driven talk radio shows that are against Amnesty for illegal aliens to be shut down or be canceled and replaced by shows with "different" viewpoints that are government mandated, instead of talk radio consumer driven. <br>  <br>  2. Senator DeMint filed a counter amendment to oppose any return of the Fairness Doctrine that was abandoned in the late 80's, after it was agreed that the doctrine was suppressing free speech on talk radio. The removal of the Fairness Doctrine is what made talk radio flourish in America and was essential to our defeat of Amnesty for illegal aliens in 2006 and 2007. <br>  <br>  3. ALIPAC caught wind of what was happening at approximately 2pm EST, when FOX NEWS broke the story about DeMint's amendment. We had our e-mail alert on the way to you, within 35 minutes of discovery, asking you to call your Senators to support DeMint and oppose Durbin's sneak attack on free speech on talk radio. <br>  <br>  4. After attempting to activate ALIPAC supporters in time to make a difference, we found that the US Senate's website went down for almost an hour, most phone lines to the Senate were busy or giving us voice mail, and that we could find the text of every other Amendment offered to S.160, except for Senator Durbin's amendment that would affect free speech and talk radio! The text of Durbin's amendment only became available to the general public this morning, almost 24 hours after the amendment was voted on and passed. <br>  <br>  5. It appears to us that many US Senators are doing the same song and dance with the Fairness Doctrine that they do with Amnesty. Many of the Senators that support Comprehensive Immigration Reform Amnesty will swear fervently "I'm against Amnesty". That is why Senator DeMint's amendment locking out the Fairness Doctrine passed 87 YEA - 11 NAY. <br>  <br>  6. Unfortunately, Senator Durbin's amendment passed as well, by a vote of 57 YEA - 41 NAY. <br>  <br>  Therefore, the Fairness Doctrine under that name has been locked out for now, but the Democrats and some Republicans have other plans that will be harder for talk radio show hosts and the public to spot in time. <br>  <br>  At ALIPAC, we feel there is already a suppression of free speech in America, due to the aggressive actions of illegal immigration and amnesty supporters. <br>  <br>  We also feel that the Open Borders Lobby is going to do everything in their power to silence or hinder free speech on the Internet and talk radio, as a prelude to a new amnesty attempt. <br>  <br>  These traitors at the top have spent millions of dollars analyzing and creating new strategies, after we defeated their plans in 2006 and 2007. They know they have to stop the public from being able to speak out freely on the Internet and talk radio shows to succeed with their unpopular agenda. <br>  <br>  While we offer our thanks and appreciation to Senator DeMint and his staff for standing up for free speech in America, there are big problems here. <br>  <br>  We take strong issue with what happened in the US Senate yesterday on the following grounds. <br>  <br>  1. Neither of these amendments were Germane to the bill being discussed and that violation of the rules and ethics of the Senate makes it impossible for any American citizen or member of the media to know what the Senate will discuss prior to the votes. <br>  <br>  2. Senator Durbin and his buddy Harry Reid rammed that amendment into a vote, while the text was not even available to the public online, which means they conspired to deprive every American of any chance of reviewing the amendment or commenting to their elected representatives about the measure. <br>  <br>  When lawmakers pull curve ball legislation and move unrelated amendments into bills, without adequate notice to the public or media, America's democratic principles are violated in lieu of autocratic rule. <br>  <br>  For full details of our analysis yesterday or to see how your Senators voted, please visit this link. <br>  <a href="http://www.alipac.us/ftopic-147714-days0-orderasc-0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alipac.us/ftopic-147714-days0...</a>|`|AA10815904	DeMint's amendment is just another way of trying to get the fairness act back in.<br>  <br>  The reason why Liberals want this regulation is to get rid of the Conservative talk shows on the radio.

That is not a "back door to censorship." It does not impose the Fairness Doctrine or deal with it.|`|Pjc3jhFraa	The way I understand it, it would force radio stations to have a liberal talk show for every conservative talk show.

I think that it's destined to fail in Congress.|`|tltloVKpaa	I would love to see the left wing media go by this...Dout if they ever would|`|wz9szz3Gaa	The Fairness Doctrine was a policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was (in the Commission's view) honest, equitable and balanced.<br>  <br>  The Fairness Doctrine should not be confused with the Equal Time rule. The Fairness Doctrine deals with matters of public importance, while the Equal Time rule deals only with political candidates.<br>  <br>  The United States Supreme Court upheld the Commission's general right to enforce the Fairness Doctrine where channels were limited, but the courts have not, in general, ruled that the FCC is obliged to do so.[ In 1987, the FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine, prompting some to urge its reintroduction through either Commission policy or Congressional legislation  <br>    <br>    However, the Senate also passed an amendment by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) that seeks to achieve the same goals of the Fairness Doctrine through backdoor FCC regulations. His legislation forces the FCC to "take actions to encourage and promote diversity in communication media ownership," an attempt to muzzle successful syndicated radio programs. The Durbin amendment would hurt small, local radio stations that depend on popular syndicated programming for listeners and revenue. The Durbin amendment passed 57-41; no Republican supported his legislation.<br>  <br>  "Today's vote slammed the front door on the so-called 'fairness doctrine,' which threatens to censor free speech and shut down talk radio," said Senator DeMint. "When senators were forced to vote in the open on this issue, they were compelled to side with the American people."<br>  <br>  "Today was an important victory for free speech, but the fight is far from over. Senator Durbin's amendment exposed Democrat intentions to impose radio censorship through the back door using vague regulations dealing with media ownership. Senator Durbin's language was so broad, it could apply beyond radio to television, newspapers and the internet. All eyes are now on the FCC. If they attempt to shut down free speech indirectly, we will fight to stop them," said Senator DeMint. This better stop before America rises up in anger for stomping on our constitutional right to free speech.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	The Durbin Amendment uses indirect means and contrivances that allow the ruling party to control the political content of speech when it occurs using radio-frequency waves. The "Fairness Doctrine" was a much more direct  form of interference with free speech than this nasty Amendment.<br>  <br>  Maybe I should keep my printing presses and hide them in the basement just in case these fascists succeed.

The article linked below provides great insight into the myths we're being fed about our current health care system.  In reality, the only way many doctors are able to remain in business today is through the acceptance of private health insurance.  Efficient as they may seem, Medicaid and often Medicare do not pay enough to cover the doctor's operating expenses, much less generate an income for him/her.  The profit they make from private insurance is not as huge and some may think, and it's actually subsidizing what the government systems aren't paying.  It's for this reason that many doctors either don't accept Medicaid or limit the number of Medicaid patients they'll accept.  They can't afford to accept them all.  Medicare is a little better, but it's still a bit of a problem for them.  I think we'll be surprised to see the number of practitioners that close their businesses if they're forced to accept a national plan and nothing is done to address the other issues relative to the cost of practicing medicine.<br>  <a href="http://www.tjols.com/article-732.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjols.com/article-732.html</a>|`|7tj1d2y5aa	These people, on this forum, who represent themselves as conservatives, are not conservative at all.

fzzkDo3saa	Here is a better idea.  If they want universal health care so bad they can all go to Canada and wait for 8 hours to get a doctor appointment and when and if they need surgery they can wait 3 months to get it done.<br>  <br>  Why people think universal health care is great is mind boggling.|`|AA10313141	Absolutely.  With the current mess of a "health-care system" right now, even though I hold a steady full-time job, it does not offer insurance and I cannot afford health insurance on my own.  I haven't been to the dentist or optomologist in a year and a half.  I have a crown that is falling apart, and am overdue for new glasses, which at my prescription cost several hundred dollars for lenses alone.<br>  <br>  And all that doesn't even take into account what would happen if something serious were to happen.<br>  <br>  So yes, we should try Obamas health care on those of us who voted for him.|`|U2T08abyaa	Absolutely.  Let the greedy and stingy republicans die in an American hospital waiting room while the CEO's of the hospital search their insurance policy instead of working on their medical needs.

Let Obama's people get medical care and let everyone else spend their last living moments shuffling through insurance policys and bank accounts.|`|o0oYsQM7aa	You know it doesn't work like that, It's socialism, all or nothing.<br>  <br>  I posed the question, " Is socialized medicine a good thing?" on the UK Yahoo.

And we still have our power hungry politicians crafting and controlling state run healthcare. You look at how effective the last three stimulus bills were, and you get a picture of how effective state run healthcare will be. OSHA and the EPA are brilliant examples of how well federal bureaucracies work.<br>  <br>  The better idea, put up a fence along the Continental Divide.

AA11622716	The answer will be in the divorce decree, not in some general law.  Most decrees require EITHER the consent of the other parent, or permission from the court to leave the state.  If the court must decide, the court will decide based on the best interests of the child, coupled with the realistic impact on the visitation or custodial rights of the non-custodial parent.  Often, the court will allow it, but will order fewer periods of visitation but for longer periods for the non-custodial parent.|`|AA10123414	She has to get a modification of the parenting plan in order to move the children out of the state.<br>  <br>  It still needs to be addressed in the parenting plan. While the case is pending she can not take the child out of state. Doing so could cost her custody. Washington state law is very specific about this.<br>  <br>  Why are you not discussing this with your lawyer?|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	She has to get the courts permission - but if she can prove to the judge that she will better support the kids financially in another state and is willing to pay for the visitations she will probably have a better chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  If she is able to accomplish this she needs to make sure she get legal custody of the children in the new state.  Other wise the father can come in and take them no questions asked.|`|2lFRYr8Eaa	If the Court finds she can move out of state, she can.  She has to get the Courts permission.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	It all comes down to what happens with the divorce: who wins custody, whether the father fights her moving his kids away, and what other arrangements happen. Like it or not, he has rights, too. He will likely argue this: he can't afford to fly them up, and if she cannot afford to live in Washington, how can she afford to fly back and forth?  (I'm not saying he is right, but that is likely what he will put forth). <br>  <br>  This same thing happened to my sister. She chose to live in the boondocks with her husband, far away from her family... and now she is stuck there. So unfortunately, it is not likely going to happen... but you never know. It ultimately depends on the specific situation. The best thing she can do: get the best attorney she possibly can. <br>  <br>  On a bright note, this answer gives me 50,000 points! Thanks! I wish your friend the best. It is a hard situation to be in.<br>  <br>  p.s. In response to your edit, I'm afraid it is true. She is going to have to convince him to let her move... unless she can prove, beyond a doubt, that he is abusive and a danger to them. An exception may be made if she can obtain a really good job out of state BEFORE she leaves, thereby confirming her ability to make certain the kids see their dad. Again, she is going to want to get the best attorney she can to pull it off.

You are not obliged to speak to the police nor to "accompany" them anywhere unless and until you have been formally arrested - at which point you'll be told the grounds for arrest and you will be read your rights. From this point on it is advisable to remain silent and ask for a solicitor to be sent for to advise you further.<br>  Even if you opt to assist police voluntarily with their enquiries you are still entitled to have a solicitor present - and this is also advisable.|`|bZTJYsoLaa	They cannot arrest you just because you keep your mouth shut.

(Nuclear power field).<br>  <br>  Physically I found the standards hard for me. Considering I was out of shape, but your recruiter will help you with this as you have to do physical training while in the DEP program.<br>  <br>  Honestly the number one piece of advice I can give you is. Its a Job.<br>  No matter what your told to do, you must do it. And you get paid pretty well for it, I found it amusing that my fellow shipmates balk at orders. When they yell at you, its not to make you quit its to help you. Its their job to do so. and do NOT take it personally. What they say may hurt you, but it is said and meant to make you stronger, to make sure you are prepared for service.<br>  <br>  Also, memorize whatever your recruiter tells you to and gives you in your DEP handbook. you must be able to recite the information off the top of your head, anytime, anyplace, to anybody.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	It was hard.

You being gone for three months and acting like an adult (which she clearly isn't) while you're gone may make her change her mind.<br>  <br>  Once you're in boot though, what she says and does doesn't matter sinec the Corps will be providing you with living quarters.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )|`|7ca6ee1f837377e576c1fd975a4b57afaa	It's sad that you mom doesn't support your decision.

Seriously, you wouldn't expect Obama to mention that, would you?<br>  <br>  "The Federal Reserve Act that began (1913) it all must surely rank as one of the most disastrous and outrageous pieces of legislation to the public welfare ever to come out of any legislative body. It may also have been and still is illegal according to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution which happens to be the inviolable law of the land. The article states that Congress shall have the power to coin (create) money and regulate the value thereof. In 1935, the US Supreme Court ruled the Congress cannot constitutionally delegate its power to another group or body. The Congress thus acted in violation of the Constitution it's sworn to uphold and in so doing created the Federal Reserve System that, as will be explained below, is a private for-profit corporation operating at the expense of the public welfare. By its action, our lawmakers committed fraud against the people of the country and so far have gotten away with it without the public even knowing about the harm done."|`|g26ICmJHaa	Well, Freddy and Fannie were allowed to run amok with terrible consequences.

That regulations were implemented that actually forced banks to lend to bad risk cases. Which contributed to the whole thing and set up Freddy and Fannie's fraud ... and I think this coup of our country and the constitution, by Obama and co.<br>  <br>  What pushed all of this to critical mass? The regulations against any kind of fuel from hydro electric to nuke to natural gas to oil, even when oil was spilling into the ocean causing a disaster of it's own and drilling would have fixed that of Santa Barbara, democrats and environmentalists (who were acting as lying politicos, not environmentalists)  forced our country to  stay away from all of these resources which would have kept the economy from staying healthy. The fuel prices put our economy to critical mass, and the credit crisis then blew up like a nuclear bomb ... thank you democrats and some weeny republicans afraid of the Watermelon pseudo environmentalists.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	They have no answers, just follow along and take his word as gospel.

e1z8pHfmaa	Here are some numbers for those conservative commentators to mull over.<br>  <br>  The national debt at the end of 2000 was about $5.7 Trillion.<br>  <br>  The national debt at the end of 2008 just before Bush left office was $10 Trillion plus.<br>  <br>  He inherited a budget surplus and turned it into a gargantuan budget deficit.<br>  <br>  If his largest budget deficit was $250 Billion and he was only in office 8 years.... how does that math work out???<br>  <br>  8 yrs. x $250 Billion = $2 Trillion<br>  <br>  If what they were sayin WAS accurate he should have left office with a national debt of LESS THAN $7.7 Trillion unless the budget deficit amount was EXACTLY $250 Billion each year.<br>  <br>  What those idiot commentator's are claiming is mathematically impossible.  They apparently prescribe to Bush's "new math" or "idiot math" as I call it.  Under that system you take the 2 largest Federal expenditures (2 foreign wars) and pretend like they don't cost money and need not be included in the budget.  Or maybe it wasn' included because the Iraq War was supposed to "pay for itself" with oil revenue that the U.S. has no legitimate claim to??<br>  <br>  Those "conservatives" fully supported Bush's creation of nearly $5 TRILLION in National debt.... nearly as much TOTAL debt as we owed after 41 prior Presidents.  Now they are up in arms that a Democratic administration is spending $1 Trillion.... when we have an actual crisis on our hands...  not a false threat like Iraqi WMD's.  If this is "conservative" then the next thing these AM radio nutjobs will be telling their sheep is that the sky is now green rather than blue and that's the "liberal's" fault too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/repor...</a><br>  <br>  King O:  Ever stop and think about the FACT that is was YOU "CONSERVATIVES" that PROPOSED the Paulson Plan to Congress.  And if you think the Iraq War cost a mere $700 Billion.... how do you explain the National Debt numbers under Bush????  Did he use the other $2 Trillion to light cigars with or what?<br>  <br>  P.S. Bush didn't include the $700 Billion Paulson Plan HE PROPOSED in his 2008 budget EITHER.  How does that jive with a maximum annual budget deficit of $250 Billion???  You cannot have $700 Billion in unbudgeted spending at one stroke of the pen.... and then claim your largest deficit was $250 Billion.... Bush signed a bill spending almost 3 times that amount with one single piece of BUSH ADMINISTRATION legislation... and he accounted for NONE of it in his 2008 budget.<br>  <br>  Eric M.:  You are being ludicrous.  $900 Trillion as a deficit is not "in the ballpark" as you claim.... $60 Trillion is the ENTIRE nominal GDP of the United States.|`|G49lKR56aa	Even if we get out of iraq now, what do you think obama's annual deficit will be?

3rIr5anraa	Addition 2 Arzoo W's answer:<br>  The UN was founded as a successor to the League of Nations, which was widely considered to have been ineffective in its role as an international governing body, as it had been unable to prevent World War II. The term "United Nations" was first used by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, which united the Allied countries of WWII under the Atlantic Charter, and soon became a term widely used to refer to them. Declarations signed at wartime Allied conferences in 1943 espoused the idea of the UN, and in 1944, representatives of the major Allied powers met to elaborate on the plans at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. Those and later talks outlined the organization's proposed purposes, membership, organs, and ideals in regards to peace, security, and cooperation.<br>  <br>  On 25 April 1945, the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the Charter of the United Nations. The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council — France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States — and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. The first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and the Security Council, took place in Westminster Central Hall in London in January 1946.<br>  Functions: Peacekeeping and security, Human rights and humanitarian assistance, Social and economic development, Mandates and Others|`|YJWQZFjTaa	An organization that takes money given by bleeding hearts in developed countries and uses it to fund pet projects that put money into the pockets of corrupt politicians.

The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries and to provide a platform for dialogue.<br>  There are currently 192 member states, including nearly every recognized independent state in the world.<br>  The organization is divided into administrative bodies, primarily:<br>  ? The General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly);<br>  ? The Security Council (decides certain resolutions for peace and security);<br>  ? The Economic and Social Council (assists in promoting international economic and social cooperation and development);<br>  ? The Secretariat (provides studies, information and facilities needed by the UN);<br>  ? The International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ).

Feel free to get married--but don't try to get government to redefine the church's definition of marriage for you.

Their racist scum and nazi wannabes and you're right anyone who as an ounce of common sense would not vote for them.<br>  <br>  I couldn't agree with you more comrade and I have to say as well the BNP supporters are losers and it's sad actually that these people lose sleep over immigration and that there are too many black people in this country and rubbish like that.|`|bIp7m1qMaa	I am almost old enuff to vote. The BNP do seem to me to have some good policies, and on some issues seem much more in touch with the UK population than any of the present lot of MPs. But there major flaw is the people running the party are racist bigots although they try to conceal that. So while I certainly think we need a change of government and also think Cameron is an even bigger prat than Brown, , I do not think I can be periaded to vote BNP.

XpUF9f1Saa	The BNP would kill anyone who isn't British, and then build a statue of Hitler or Stalin over them. Anyone who doesn't think that they are racist should read their manifesto.<br>  <br>  I would imagine that British people would be very embarrassed of that. I admire British culture. What's great about British people is that they don't judge based on ethnic background or religion, and that they are very nice. The BNP goes against all that.<br>  <br>  The BNP are equal to the NAZI party, or any other fascist freaks. To prove my point - <br>  <br>  There are 5 steps to fascism:<br>  1. Obey<br>  2. Divide the community into 'us' and 'them'<br>  3. Give the order 'do them Harm'.<br>  4. See who refuses and label them 'sympathizers of them'<br>  5. Eliminate 'them', either by killing them, or trashing their reputation, or driving them abroad.<br>  <br>  The BNP are already on the 4th step. UGH. I don't like their ideology, but they have a right to run for office like any other party.|`|EJAvOHxGaa	Give me evidence that the BNP support Hitler.  Evidence please.  Otherwise, you're talking complete hogwash.  Yes, NAZIs may support them because they are closer (very conservative) to what they beleive in but they are no where near Fascism.  All they want is to maintain British culture.  <br>  <br>  Let me ask you this, does New Labour/Labour make you ashamed to be British because many people who support New Labour also supported a totalitarian communist system (that worshipped Joe Stalin)that kept people behind walls with machine.  Thankfully, this regime started to crumble around 1985.|`|27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  How unfortunate that many people don't agree - and even more unfortunate that many people think that the BNP actually care, actually believe what they're saying, and actually won't screw everyone over just like every single other politician on the face of the planet.|`|3YydMgt0aa	No, because BNP have rules to stop immigration and at the moment it's becoming so much of a problem in the UK.

Just these items total around 450 billion, which when added to the 550 billion reported deficit, pushes the actual number to 1 trillion deficit for 2008. That is not the true number either because of other accounting practices. Our structural deficit runs about 1.3 trillion dollars, excluding the bailouts. Obama's 1.755 trillion deficit is inclusive of everything, but is still an increase. We are heading for a fiscal meltdown, so you better hope Obama is able to reduce the actual deficit. I think it will take 20-25 years to reduce the deficit to 1-2% of GDP, but only if we fundementally change the structural problems we have on the spending side.|`|SEwG8Yl4aa	he is a politician.  So what if he doubles the deficit before he cuts it in half returning it to the same deficit he inherited.  Oh and pay no attention to the CBO who says that it would have reduced by 70% had he just kept things they way they are or the CBO report that states after being cut in half by 2012 the deficit will rise again for the four following years by $200M -$300M per year.|`|Q6euzOmVaa	you missed the part about how it is during his "first term."

Nobody had said that they wished Bush would fail, only that they didn't support his invasion of Iraq as well as multitude of other programs. Yet for this we were labeled as traitors by a right wings. So by your own logic, Rush, you and everyone who agrees with Rush on this point must be a traitor, right? After all, what you are claiming is a lot stronger then what any Democrat has suggested.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I criticized Bush, but I still hoped he would succeed.  He was still our president, and if the president fails, so does the country.  Rush just admitted his loyalties to conservatism are greater than his loyalties to the country.  That makes him a hypocritical patriot.|`|RZfoszJFaa	To start with, Dems only opinion of Rush is from a 5 sec clip. They get upset when he says he hopes Obama fails because they really hate trying, self reliance, and personal responsibility.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	It's not just Democrats; it's any rational-minded American.  Like it or not, Obama is president and the policies his administration sets, along with Congress, will be the policies of the US.  If Obama's plans fail, then the country suffers and we, as Americans, will also suffer to some degree.  Despite the fact that you or others may disagree with some of his policies and ideologies, you should still want him to succeed at turning around the economy for the better. <br>  <br>  Therefore, you should want Obama to succeed because that also means success for the country.<br>  <br>  If you want Obama to fail, then you also want the country to suffer and why would anyone (with a brain) want that?|`|MZBP1Souaa	I don't think it's Democrats that are getting upset, I think it's Republicans.  The Dems are happy to have an oaf like Limbaugh claim to be the defacto head of the Republican party.  <br>  <br>  Remember how Republicans used to say that Michael Moore was the brains of the Democratic party?  He never was, but because right-wingers put his name in the media so much, people had to see what the hype was all about.  They checked out Michael Moore's website, his documentary films, and television interviews...  It turns out he's not a bad guy, he wants what most Americans want.  Things like healthcare, the rich to be taxed at the same rate as the middle and lower class, less guns on the streets etc...<br>  <br>  The Democrats are now shining the spotlight on Rush Limbaugh.  He's showing that he's a classless jerk.  He's a larger, less intelligent, drug addicted, big mouthed boob.  To be clear, he doesn't even begin to make sense.  He rants about not caring if Michael J. Fox dies of Parkinson's Disease, he rants about Ted Kennedy dying before the new medicare bill, he wishes that the leader of the U.S. fails...  Why? <br>  <br>  ...Because he's the embodiment of everything that the world hates about America.  Overweight, rich, loudmouthed, racist, greasy, overindulgent, doped out, man with a microphone paid for by the right-wing media.  Radio is dead.  Limbaugh is soon to be an afterthought.  The world is evolving.  With the internet and the vast amount of info at everyone's fingertips, the truth can be found very quickly on blogs, twitter, facebook etc., and the truth is Rush Limbaugh is a big fat liar.|`|VpNtcji2aa	Because they know Rush is correct and understand what Rush really means because translated what Rush is saying is that in order for America to succeed Obama must fail so Rush wants Obama to fail as do I watching this Obama farce and disaster from my property in Canada//Man Obama must go asap////|`|AA10465540	Rush has a very limited audience and by and large Democrats could care less about him or what he says.

He is always at his "best" when he is standing for the "opposition".|`|70ce28ddca2fb9f359700f7e854fcb03aa	Maybe they want him to be successful at increasing their electric bills, increasing the cost of gas and food, high inflation, a crippled banking system, and stock market crash because that's what his liberal agenda is doing!|`|9P3uKmPlaa	They aren't upset, they are trying to move the focus of discussion to Rush to distract people from what he is doing to the economy and people's freedoms.|`|b8dc8adb41a42f13a584203d858553e4aa	remember i support troops , but not the war.<br>  they said ,they doing their patriotic duty.|`|AA12045802	Rush just wants the whole country to fail,so he can keep spewing his garbage.|`|iE7noPQPaa	because if Obama fails america will fail!!!|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Keep saying it, Rush!

Hypocrites!
9PAavWnyaa	I've noticed something about the far left, the lunatic left fringe (not liberals nor Democrats as a whole) over the years: when they encounter an idea, or a person, who they can't reasonably respond to with facts or a logical counter argument, they turn to character assassination and attack the person rather than their position. Look at Keith Olbermann -- the man doesn't have an objective bone in his body so he goes after people when they express an opinion simply because he can't come up with a better argument.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I think Ann Coulter is VERY funny.

Every economic boom is followed by an economic downfall.  When the dot-com bubble burst, people withdrew their money out of the stock market and put it into real estate.  This caused a bubble in real estate that eventually burst, and because banks and mortgage companies were looking to make a quick buck, they gave mortgages to people who couldn't afford them in the long run.  When their rates were readjusted, these people had to means to meet their new obligations.  <br>  <br>  This caused the financial markets collapse of 2007.  Bush's policy of massive deregulation contributed, but ultimately the blame should be divided between the institutions who practiced bad business and irresponsible people who knowingly decided to live beyond their means.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	See the deal is this is what should have happen after 9/11 but you don't see anyone giving credit to Bush from stopping this then do you?  <br>  <br>  It is a mess and it will take a lot to get it cleaned up - I just don't think what Obama has planned will even put a dent in it.

I was there last year.<br>  <br>  The US is still more successful, but that is changing.<br>  <br>  China has figured out that 100% communism/socialism is not good.  People just do the bare minumum.  When they allowed capitalism out in the farms and allowed the farmers to keep the extra they produced, they saw an immediate increase in the output of the farmers.  They were so surprised, they started expanding capitalism on a grand scale.<br>  <br>  Many in China are still supplied everythng they need from the government.  These people pretty much live in poverty, but get the very basics supplied to them.  It is not a pleasant life.  Those that are in areas where capitalism is utilized have a good standard of life.  Homes, cars, can take trips.<br>  <br>  In the US however, we are on a reverse course.  We're so dumb not to learn from history and our neighbors.

You have the Chinese people making a buck an hour in a government factory for a product that is sold for $10 and the government gets the profits. That's how it works in a communist country where the people work for the government, earning what the government sees fit to pay them. Really, it is little more than mass slavery to a master who is, at the moment, somewhat benevolent. But at a whim, that master could turn quite ugly and the peasants would have nothing to say about it. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way, the American government would be quite flush too if it owned and managed all the businesses and was entitled to all the profits. Hmmm...that doesn't sound too far fetched does it?|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	A country with about 400,000,000 unemployed, no human rights, thousands of public executions and over 70,000 protests a year is not successful.|`|AA10382849	By what measure...you must not be familiar with China.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	Chinese will work for a dollar a day & a bowl of rice for lunch..

95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	She is a minor so you (or her legal guardians: parents) don't need her consent to file charges on her name and to request a restraining order against that guy. Remember he is not just a rapist, he is a child molester and if you don't report it then he will feel free to do it AGAIN. <br>  <br>  Also keep record of time and date of his calls, tex, or voicemail, or everytime he tries to get close to her.<br>  <br>  Don't underestimate the officers in the sexual crime division they know that it's hard and scary is everything for the victims and they know how to deal with this situations. <br>  <br>  Also call the hot-line for rape victims in your area, the call is free and confidential and you will get all the orientation and support you might need.<br>  <br>  If you still decide not to go to court then remember that she got about 5 or 10 year after becoming her 18th birthday (depending on the jurisdiction) to report the rape.|`|n72qWMcRaa	She needs help,I went to The Havens and reported a sexual assault that happened to me about 6 months ago.It wasn't the end of it I felt better and worse.It may have been the best thing to do.the Police woman was not on my side and I was currently being accused by some Egyptian Woman.Sex to Egyptians is a Medicine.Hopefully the two will obliterate each other.<br>    I feel the need to pray and read the Bible and feel that I am up against sinister forces of evil.|`|AA11315360	Convince her to tell the police. At least it will start a file on the guy so if he rapes someone else and they go to the police, they will be believed.<br>  <br>  She needs to talk to a rape counselor or go to a group for rape victims for victims of violence.|`|U69AYTZIaa	I would contact the police and also try to get your sister to see a rape crisis therapist. Right now she is in a lot of pain emotionally. Someone needs to do something right away because this person may do this again. One thing at least be there for her emotionally if she needs a shoulder to cry on. I wish you the best of luck with your sister.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Call her local police, inform them of what occurred and the situation that you're in.  She'll have to talk to the police about it herself so they can get her side of the story, but since she's still a juvenile, they should have a child protective services advocate and a child expert talking to her so that she wouldn't necessarily have to keep on repeating her story in court, special services advocates are recognized as court experts and can give testimony as to what the victim said.  Call the police, give them the recording... just, anything you can.  The process will be long and hard, and you will forever want to kill this guy, but you can't do that =(.  I know exactly how you feel, when I was younger someone close to me was raped as well, and I felt angry and felt like killing the guy, but I got my emotions under control and called the police.  This guy's now in prison.  Good luck, and I hope the best for you.  (Also I'd suggest having the family buy a gun in case if he attempts to make good on his threats of harm... police response isn't always quick enough.)
qp8y4Hs5aa	if you want an honest opinion....DONT join the army. they are the first ones they send over sea's straight after boot camp/tech school. my husband is in the USAF and it has been an awesome experience so far. the benefits are amazing and its a wonderful chance to see the world (we are stationed in turkey right now! freaking turkey!) <br>  i understand that they send all branches of the military overseas to fight in the war, but ARMY is always right there. the same goes for the marines. <br>  its your life, choose wisely. and if you decide to join the army god bless you and thank you :).<br>  good luck.|`|HvbIE03saa	The possibility to do both exists.<br>  <br>  You can start with the Army or National Guard Reserves, both of which can offer enlistment bonuses as well as access to the GI Bill which can help pay for college.

GJKWgx0Paa	yes, it would be possible.<br>  <br>  in essence, it would happen if the 5% with the highest incomes (who already pay 60% of the taxes) began refusing to pay taxes.  Since there are 300 million plus Americans, 5% is 15 million people.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to imprison 15 million people for non-payment of taxes.<br>  <br>  and without the tax revenues, the government's debt paper would be worthless.  That would end deficit spending, cause tremendous inflation as the government prints ever more money to try and maintain its giveaways, and eventually cause the economy and government to collapse a la Zimbabwe.<br>  <br>  ...|`|e9z5oVKPaa	I'm afraid it's coming.<br>  <br>  I live in the north Mr Ed, and if I have to join the southern states in this I will, but I doubt it as you who have probably never been out of your comfort zone, do not realize how many northerners are tired of obama's great plan.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	The reason we are being overtaken by this stealth seditionist from Kenya is because we are a nation of pleasure seeking, responsibility avoiding bottom dwellers.

If this country can't go one day and work together to boycott the oil companies by not buying any gas, how do you expect this country to put together a Revolution? The USA is full of dreamers and cavemen.|`|Lfn2LOTzaa	Yes, it is possible. I am surprised to see so many people say it is "improbable" or "highly unlikely". Depending on circumstances and how bad things get and time it is practically inevitable. Once the government starts deviating from what the majority of citizens want, the more unrest there will be. This is very possible in the two party system we have. It seems the re pubs turn their back on their constituents once they get in office, and now Obama has already broken several campaign promises in a month. Promises of Bipartisanship, spending, "going line by line in bills" to cut out pork and waste full inefficient programs, etc. I know as a re pub I am not happy about this. I imagine the Dem's are not thrilled. But it would probably come from the party opposing the party controlling government in office.<br>  Even if that seems far fetched, I think TIME is the major issue. Almost ALL countries have revolted against the ruling government at least once in it's history, including America already. Twice if you count the civil war, in which half the country wanted to secede and the revolutionary war with the controlling government from Brittain. Once the majority of ppl. feel they are not being represented it is just a matter of time. The "Right to bear arms" was partly built into the constitution for this reason. "In order to maintain a well regulated militia". This helps protect us from our OWN government too. <br>   But in regard to new currency, yes we can make new cash. But unless we want to be completely isolationist, the other countries that we are very indebted to financially would have to "forgive" this debt or we would still have to pay it back or our currency would mean little globally.<br>  <br>  I know alot of ppl. that are very unhappy with the way this goverment is going right now. And I live in Philly! Imagine what is going on down South! I am certainly not saying we should revolt now, though, don't get me wrong. That is NOT what I am saying at all.....But if it ever DID get to an intolerable point I would join in the fight.

Your learn how to set up barracades and anti tank traps, Fire anti tanks weapons. You are also trained in first aid as you are Medic, Enginer, Mechaninc and so on. You will do marching drills and Long marches up to and even beyond 12 miles. You may also be required to do 12 miles in under 3 hours as I was in The Big Red One which is not quit that easy. This is not in a straight line either it is over hills and thru the woods to grandmothers house you go. You have a 20Lb rucksack and 2 canteens of water BDU's Boots, helement and you Rifle. If you don't finish in under 3 hours you do it agian on a Saturday until you do under 3. It is also very physical as the Rucks can weigh up to 100+lbs plus flak vest and all your gear. So be sure your physically fit or you'll be hurten<br>  This is what I remenber doing when I was in but things may have changed since 1988-1992. Maybe someone esle on here may have something different than what I went thru when I was in.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	It's a tough job, I'll tell you that. It's also a lot of fun. Every moment should like be on a poster. I love the training. You have to be really smart to do it also. You hear people say that the Infantry is where everyone goes who couldn't pass the ASVAB, but that is definitely not true. I chose the Infantry with no regrets. I love my job.|`|bMLg87pMaa	I was Infantry 11B.  I was in for 3 yrs and 7 months.  I been to Korea for a year, and Iraq for 15 months.  I been out of Army for about a year now.  Now I am getting into the Navy reserves to be a Seabee Builder.  I did not like the Army and Infantry much.  Infantry is a hard job to do. You do get a lot of time off, but after 2 weeks of hard work and training.  The people in Infantry, well some are good and some are bad like drink too much, drugs, ect.  I wish I did not do Infantry or the Army, but joined the Air Force or Navy.  I got f**ked joining the Army, because I did not know what Infantry was.  The career councilor told me Infantry was paint ball lol.  I was going to join the Air Force, but my ASVAB score was a 35 and needed a 40.  Instead of studying for couple of months I took the Air Force recruiters stupid advice and joined the Army.  Infantry is for people with low ASVAB scores.  There are some real stupid people in that MOS.  A lot of the people in Infantry were criminals and had the option go Infantry Army or jail.  My gt score was 86 and needed 90 for Infantry, but a waiver took care of that in seconds.  What is Infantry?  Infantry's job is to kill, they are combat and do 75% of what the special forces do.  You will be doing basic and AIT at Fort Benning GA or 16 weeks.  You will learn MOUT, Battle drills, get no sleep, learn to deal with high stress, learn to kill,  learn all about diffrent types of weapons and use all of them a 1000 times, top  physical fittness training,like 8 mile 50lb ruck marches, 1hr PT.  Be prepared for long days and real short nights.  When you get to your unit everybody will f**k with you big time.  They will tell you ask the  1SG for a pricky 8, which you are telling the 1SG to f**k off.  Theres lots of others too.  If you dont drink, than dont join because you will.  You will go to Iraq or Afganistan and be there from 12 to 24 months.  In the Army Infantry expect the worst and hope for the best.  "READ" this essay real good and hard before you join beacause this is your life, and life is short, so do good things.|`|4IXQ97rNaa	fun and hard|`|uj4Dv8awaa	If you ever want to be given respect for a job infantry is the way to go. In the army infantry men are highly respected and we get to do a lot of cool ****. Like some of the other guys have said its awesome and i promise you no other job can make you feel more proud about your self. <br>  <br>  The 11B training is challenging and it opens up so many options to you if ever want to become a ranger, special forces, or whatever.

I say that because I'm tired of this mindset of accepting the "least worst".  My opinion is that bad is bad regardless of how two different bad things compare with each other. <br>  <br>  She has too many kids and she cannot possibly take care of them without assistance.  She should never have been allowed to have them to begin with as she already had a bunch of kids. It's irresponsible and places added burden on our social programs when there are other people out there who legitimately need assistance and have at least been attempting to live a responsible life.<br>  <br>  Illegals are illegal, period. There is no debate on this one.|`|wnzK56fiaa	Octomom - at least she is legal, just nuts.

Since I must pick one, it would be Octomom, since there are only 14 that tax dollars would be supporting.

First couple of times I saw Jindal, I liked him. He seemed smart, charismatic and a good communicator. He was one of the first conservatives who actually seemed to have proactive solutions to real issues, framed with conservative principles. He was refreshing compared to the tired old small government, anti-liberal banter that only connects with phobic, anal retentive Bible belters. But, what happened? His rebuttal to Obama's speech was horrible in tone, message and delivery. Who is the real Jindal? Is he caving to the crusty old conservative base?|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	I'm sure the people in Louisiana have seen him.

Obama wants more troops and more military spending. Obama wants to help the rich by inflating the money supply (the best thing a rich person can be involved in). The inflation tax is what I'm talking about. Obama is TOTALLY a fascist socialist JUST like McCain, Bush and Clinton. He doesn't represent change, he represents more of the same. People don't like to look more than 4 years in the past.<br>  <br>  A economic conservative means less taxes and less spending which helps rich and poor alike, except that the neo-cons skip the less spending thing. Neocons and neolibs are the same as far as I'm concerned.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Because helping the "Rich" as you call them helps the poor.  The more job opportunities available, the more likely a person will be able to secure an income to raise his/her own family.  It's a causal relationship -- Cause/Effect.<br>  <br>  This whole idea of pitting the rich against the poor is old and tired.  The argument holds no merit in a system where the amount of effort an individual puts forth determines his/her success.  That is of course if that person chooses to think 'smarter' rather than 'harder'.|`|AA10392074	Mc Cain has some good ideas just like obama dose. as far as the black white thing... i believe the results were as follows Whites voted pretty close to 50% mccain and 50% obama...

On the other hand, your precious Obama donated about 1% of his income to charities until he decided to run for President and knew people would be looking at such things. He upped his donations over the last couple of years to about 7-8%! <br>  <br>  Knowing that, do you still think McCain only helps the rich? And does that change your perspective of Obama at all? Doesn't seem he practices what he wants the rest of us to do, does it.
fBvhkalFaa	I used to think it meant something but after the past 8 years and two months, I am now pretty sure it doesn't.  If it did, we would raise taxes and cut spending to get control of it.  We are not doing either.  I sure as hell wouldn't want the government running my household budget.|`|DjdZOeUlaa	The U.S. government has just two ways of getting money coming in.  Taxes on it's companies and citizens; or selling debt securities to foreign countries.  Printing more money is not an option.  Higher taxes mean citizens have less to spend ...no growth.  Foreign countries expect to be repaid or they quit buying... no growth.  You lose either way.|`|TpdVba4baa	Trust the Obamessiah!|`|CBx6qHztaa	He should know, he's responsible for over half of it and that's only 30 days worth.<br>  <br>  He's spent 35 billion dollars a day and it's still rising.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	Wow he is actually right about something!

It clings to the concepts of some of its philosophers, and in this case, novelists, while ignoring the reality of the world around us. The political vision of one person, no matter how well expressed,  does not make it a true one. Expand your mind, face the facts of the real world and disabuse yourself of adherence to a narrow and failed ideology and, most important, think for yourself.

Bush’s push to cut tax rates on most capital gains to 15% in 2003.<br>  <br>  Capital gains made up 63% of the richest 400 Americans’ adjusted gross income in 2006, or a combined $66.1 billion, according to the data.

The founding fathers knew it thus adopted the second amendment to our constitution.  When we see our elected officials attempted to disarm the citizen population you can bet that they have a new direction other than freedom in mind for our great Nation.

Make sure you take pictures of all your electronics, things you cherish, etc... Write down the serial #s for electronics as well.  So that is anything is damaged or stolen you can make a claim.

9XJLlPaEaa	Dating is just weird, but any physical contact is considered statutory rape, save holding hands, and maybe a hug. <br>  Statutory rape and rape are very different terms. Rape is forceful penetration, statutory rape is any sexual contact with a minor.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Actually the age of consent in Australia varies between states.  It's 17 in SA and Tasmania, 16 in the other states although in Queensland it's illegal to have anal sex with someone under 18.  And there are various exceptions with regard to the age difference between parties and so on.  It's also an offence under Australian federal law to have sex with someone under 16 while overseas.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to give you an example from legislation, the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) uses the term 'sexual intercourse' which it defines thus:<br>   "sexual intercourse" includes any activity (whether of a heterosexual or homosexual nature) consisting of or involving— <br>              (a)         penetration of a person's vagina, labia majora or anus by any part of the body of another person or by any object; or <br>              (b)         fellatio; or <br>              (c)         cunnilingus, <br>  and includes a continuation of such activity;<br>  <br>  That's with regard to the charge of unlawful sexual intercourse, or statutory rape as it is popularly known.  There are also other relevant offences which cover inducing someone under the age of consent to perform an indecent act or expose him- or herself.  Dating, however, is not an offence and nor is kissing.|`|AA10465540	Dating is okay, but not advisable with someone so young.

JKbvnwcDaa	There is a huge difference between a certificate of live birth and a birth certificate. Barack Obama has never even claimed to have been born in the US, the only thing that he produced was a certificate of live birth. <br>  <br>  Nobody can claim that they have heard Obama claim to have been born here, because he has NEVER said it.<br>  <br>  : okay Tubby, I sure as hell would say I was American if millions of people claimed that I wasn't. The man never addressed it. It didn't take him but a second to call a press conference regarding race and "Rev' Wright, but he never uttered a word about his place of birth..that doesn't make you wonder, eh?|`|CM1dfztQaa	You can buy just about anything with enough money and power.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	The idea that a "CERTIFICATE of live BIRTH" isn't a "BIRTH CERTIFICATE" is ludicrous at best.

I also happened to lose my original birth certificate long ago so I had a new one issued in 1997.  Now this is Texas, but the title is "Certification of Vital Record."  It gives only the basics:  name, date, sex, place, mother, father and date filed.  It has the seal and it has the certification that the facts were provided by the Texas Department of Health FROM A DOCUMENT OFFICIALLY IN ITS CUSTODY.  <br>  I know that I was born in the US.  The fact that I lost my original birth certificate means I lost something that had much that was hand written and had much more information (I seem to remember it even listed parent's occupations).<br>  Am I a naturalized citizen or since I only have the Certification of Vital Records am I really from Kenya?|`|2RE9mMtMaa	Here's one.

Pain = Injury    Repetitions and time will get you to your goal. To aid in building muscle, find proteins in chicken breasts, or whey protein powders if you can afford.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	You need lean meats or eggs, cottage cheese. Have some sugar with the protein.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	The trick to doing push-ups quickly is in understanding exactly what is considered a push-up by special ops..  Don't waste time dipping further than necessary to qualify each rep as a push-up..   Find out the standard then place a stack of books(or other items) under your chest at the the exact level you need to dip to..  Then practice, training your body to know the pattern... The milliseconds you save not dipping to far will add up quickly giving you that much more time to complete the required reps... <br>  <br>  <br>  Tuna is a high protein food with a pretty low price (especially when on sale)..|`|z1UXptEmaa	foods have nothing to do with it.... practice.... do atleast 1200-1500 a day in a single set, as in get down and do 20 then rest then do 20 more and continue on until you reach 1500, it should take you no longer than an hour to do this, if you are committed to joining any special warfare team you should be willing to dedicate the time to practice doing this, also you need to focus on swimming and pull-ups|`|7idyT7Obaa	who told you you need to do 100 pushups for SF? you dont even need to do 72. i mean its not a bad way to get in shape but its not a necessity. <br>  anyway wide arm pushups are the easiest. but if you really want to improve, start hitting the gym and lifting weights. my last pt test that i did i maxed out (75 i think? 22-25 age group) in 55 seconds. didnt keep going because there was no way i was gonna max the run. and the last time that i did a single pushup before that was my last PT test which was like 6 months before. i just worked out every day. a pushup is only lifting about 1/3 of your body weight.<br>  granted working out using your body weight is a good thing, but thats why there's dips.<br>  if u really want to get good at pushups, start going to the gym and do this for your chest routine (dont neglect yoru other muscle groups though):<br>  4 sets dumbell presses: 12-10-8-6<br>  <br>  4 sets incline dumbell presses: 12-10-8-6<br>  <br>  if you have a buddy to spot you:<br>  4 sets decline barbell press: 12-10-8-6<br>  if you dont:<br>  4 sets cable flys focusing on your lower chest: 12-10-8-6<br>  <br>  40 dips. as many sets as it takes you to get there. if you can do them in 3 or less sets, move up to 50, etc.<br>  <br>  you know you're using the correct weight when it feels like you BARELY got up the last rep.<br>  <br>  using dumbells makes sure that one side of your body wont start to overcompensate for the other and it works the support muscles more.<br>  <br>  thats all i did for my chest and i knocked out 75 pushups in 55 seconds and i wasnt even tired<br>  <br>  it also helps to get a good breathing rythem. start with inhaling going down and exhaling coming up. until your pushups get too fast for that then breath in for 1 and breath out for 1.|`|5BXmqYrYaa	dont overdo it on the tuna. high mercury content can lead to alzheimers. you need to work on your bench as well that way pushing the little amount of upper body weight you have will feel like nothing. eat a diet high in proteins, low saturated fat, low amount of refined sugar. take protein shakes as well. one in the morning, 2 after workout, and 1 at night. got me 101 in 2 minutes while in iraq.|`|xpvFbcJqaa	My friend is trying to get picked up for SF and he highly recommends the "100 pushup challenge". Google it, he swears by it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jKiVzmnCaa	Eating well should improve your overall health, and if seeking to use push ups as a way to increase muscle, higher protein foods definitely won't set you back.  Eggs, fish, nuts, milk, beans, etc.  Whey primarily should be used right after workouts as its absorbed relatively quicker than say the protein found in eggs (which, is very good protein).  But, don't skimp out on carbs and fats as well.  Ultimately, finding a good ratio between protein/carbs/fat is the best answer.  Nutrition, and building muscle isn't just about protein.<br>  <br>  As for doing 100 push ups.  Practice.  Do sets throughout the day.  If you want to set aside a chunk of time to doing 20 reps, rest, another 20, etc -- go for it.  However, if you do an exhaustive session be sure to give your arms/body at least a days rest.<br>  <br>  Also understand that push ups are not an amazing indicator of strength.  Its about quick drops, and explosive ups.  After you drop down have a mental picture of a little "explosion" that quickly throws you back up to the starting position.  It trains your muscles, and nerves to get into that habit.  And it is ultimately the key to doing a lot of push ups within a short time frame.  Doing the slow "doooooown....uuuuuuup" type push ups are geared towards strength.  Also find out if Spec Ops requires that you "break the plane."  The Army does not, but people often say that you're supposed to...which just isn't true, and simply wastes time/energy.<br>  <br>  Also, find which hand position works best for you (or, if Spec Ops requires a certain position of the hands).  For me, I have a stronger chest so I prefer a wider hand position.  Some people prefer closer, or variants.<br>  <br>  Anyways -- just keep doing them throughout the day, give yourself a days rest, and repeat again.  Maybe after each days rest have your starting set attempt to reach 100 -- I think this would allow you to see your progress.  If you don't make it to 100, simply take a break and start doing your 20 reps/rest cycle.   <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|B7fS9hWOaa	One thing about pushups you must know is it's all about repetition. I worked my way up to 100 from 15, all i did was just work on them everyDAY(3-5 sets a day) until you can't do them anymore.<br>  <br>  Protein is also key, go buy some whey, or some protein of your choice.|`|7bc450c6091ac93a4d64108b856a5e7daa	5 sets of 20 pushups 3-5 second breaks...<br>  <br>  Plyo metrics<br>  Try putting a basketball underneath your chest, do a push up, and push all the way up onto the ball with your hands. Then do a push up like that, and 'jump off' the ball back to the ground. ''shock'' your muscles. You'll be doing 100 no sweat.|`|stn6U07Paa	<a href="http://hundredpushups.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hundredpushups.com/</a><br>  <br>  I've never tried it but it gives you a 6 week program to work up to 100 pushups.

f59ce3e6c69a87e4365442d083f0f2b6aa	That's what happens when the government controls health care:  then government, not you, makes the choices of who gets it... and who DOESN'T.<br>  <br>  And that's how Obama and the other socialist Dumocrats plan to addict Americans to government health care -- by promising government-provided goodies to enough voters to make it law.<br>  <br>  Amber W:  are you really that naive?  Universal, which means government-provided, health care won't lower prices.  When did the government do ANYTHING more efficiently or cheaper than the private sector?  Universal health care will just mean that we'll all get the same crappy, third-rate, rationed health care as socialist Europe and Canada -- except for the rich, who will still be able to afford quality health care outside the lousy system that the government will compel the rest of us to use.<br>  <br>  And "ALL OF US" won't pay, ALL of us NEVER pay, it's always the tax-payers who support the non-tax-payers; it will just be more socialism, more transfer of wealth by the government from the producers to the sick, lame and lazy non-producers.  If all health care was privately-operated and pay-as-you-go, with no health insurance of any kind, THEN costs would come down because everybody in health care would have to truly compete for your business like other industries.<br>  <br>  Prison Officer:  the US government is whoever the voters elect.  If you and your friends and neighbors keep electing liberal Dumocrats into government who work to establish a socialist big government that everybody is addicted to at the expense of your liberty and your wallet, is that government's fault, or yours?

Consequently, the state government requires all patients to purchase “benefits” that are useless to many of them—benefits they would never voluntarily choose to purchase in a free market. For example, Massachusetts currently requires insurance plans to include forty-three mandatory benefits, including in vitro fertilization, blood lead poisoning treatment, and chiropractor services—whether or not customers want them. Residents must purchase alcoholism therapy benefits, even if they are teetotalers. These mandated benefits have raised the costs of health insurance in Massachusetts by 23 to 56 percent.15<br>  <br>  Costs to the state government have skyrocketed and are projected to run hundreds of millions of dollars over budget.16 Because the mandated insurance is so expensive, the government has had to subsidize the costs of the premiums not only for lower-income residents, but also for residents with incomes as high as $60,000 for a family of four—which is three times the Federal Poverty Level.17 The state had expected a “significant drop in spending . . . for the uninsured” but has since acknowledged that this “is not going to happen to any large extent in 2009.”18 Instead, overall costs to the state have risen by more than $400 million, 85 percent more than originally projected.19<br>  <br>  Because of its own rising costs, the state government has cut payments to doctors and hospitals.

The problem is that it's difficult to escape it without an education, largely because day care costs as much as a low paying job.<br>  <br>  Now if we want people in that situation to be productive, we need to subsidize or provide free day care, or give them government jobs that that they can do at home on the phone/computer.<br>  <br>  You could argue that child services should just take the kid, but that's no more expensive than welfare and probably worse for the child.  And there's no way to prevent the woman from having another child unless you start to get a bit Orwellian...|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	I just wonder if all the do gooders answering your question actually pay any tax but are in fact are in receipt of every handout from the taxpayer. Perhaps your question pricked their conscience ( if they have one ) and this is how they react|`|52UwQKmWaa	Maybe we should focus on parents being involved in children's lives instead of expecting our schools to raise our children. Maybe going beyond abstinence only in schools might be a good idea. And maybe just maybe if we teach our kids about birth control, condoms, the vagina, the penis, sex, and all the sexual diseases out there then it may prevent most pregnancies. But saying to a child just don't have sex until your married really does not cut it. My parents were fairly liberal in teaching me about sex, and you know what, I am not sleeping around with everything that walks.|`|AA11589988	Yes, with all kinds of contraception plus morning after pills and abortion available today there is no excuse for accidental pregnancies. When these girls make that choice to have the baby they should be thinking "How am I going to pay to support this child?". If she doesn't have the means or the father doesn't have the means then she should not have the baby! The idea that the State should pay to look after someone's child is alien to me. I don't have a spongers mentality so I don't understand these girls.<br>  One benefit of cutting back on social security is that it would force girls and boys to think twice before they recklessly have sex. These feckless idiots cost the country an absolute fortune over their lifetimes and most criminals come from single parent households too.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	Why the **** are you generalising all single mothers?

The law that he wrote was that "paper money will always revert back to it's natural state"....meaning worthless, "whereas gold and silver will be always worth something". Now then, since Gordon Brown did all the gold buyers a favour a few years ago by dumping ALL our gold onto the world market and devalued it, I just wish I'd have bought some now.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Absolutely yes, good insight.<br>  <br>  "Trickle Down" economics was a "Trojan Horse"<br>  The truth is that "Trickle-Down" was never intended to help middle income and poor Americans; it was intended to help the wealthy and Corporate America<br>  The issue is that the economic policies of the Reagan administration were designed to primarily benefit wealthy Americans. At the time a lot of smoke and mirrors were used to convince average Americans that these policies would help them as well. A similar set of lies has been used by those, like Steve Forbes, who promote a flat tax system.<br>  What the "Trickle-Down"/Supply Side policies of the Reagan administration were designed to do was to increase the amount of money available to wealthy Americans for investing and developing businesses. This was intended to create an increase in production of products and services and hence and increase in new jobs. The reason that the policy is called Supply Side, is because the supply of goods increases before there is a demand for goods. So, in that case, the supply of goods is intended to then spark demand, resulting in economic growth.<br>  This use of Supply Side policy led to a huge increase in consumerism and the use of credit. An environment of consumerism was created in American society through the media via advertisements, movies, and television shows, etc. that promoted consumerism. Consumers though, did not have the money to fulfill the desires created by society so debt was used to participate in the economy. Restrictions on credit were loosened under the Reagan administration making it easier for individuals to gain credit lines because the use of credit was essential to growing the economy because real wages were not going up for the average American, yet it was essential that the average American increase spending in order to fuel the economy. <br>  <a href="http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/trickle_down.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/tr...</a><br>  Conservative policies failed America,  it was deliberate and yes they still try to sell the same nonsense<br>  <a href="http://arran.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/trickle-down-economics-the-4th-conservative-failure/" rel="nofollow">http://arran.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/tr...</a>|`|DNaMIcomaa	Absolutely! The failure of Reagan's "trickle down" economics as practiced by every administration since (yes this includes Bill Clinton) is that it did not keep middle class wages (you remember the middle class.They used to be consumers) high enough to support a REAL economy, and soooo credit was loosened in order to falsely prop up the economy. Greenspan the bubble-maker just could not create any more bubbles. Just like in real life deficit spending cannot go on forever and the bill came due.Couple this failure to unfair trade agreements, and the exodus of American manufacturing jobs outsourced to cheap labor overseas, and you have the recipe for disaster cooked up by Reagan conservatism that has brought us to our present crises.<br>  <br>  Edit: For those of you that revere Ronald Reagan, here are a few facts that A.M. radio and the right-wing thinks DON'T tell you.<br>  <br>  Before Ronald Reagan the United States of America was the largest lender nation and the largest exporter of manufactured goods in the world.<br>  After Ronald Reagan The United States of America is the worlds largest debtor nation and the largest importer of manufactured goods. The only thing that we are succesfully exporting is raw materials, much like third world nations.<br>  <br>  Most people do not know that Ronald Reagan borrowed more money than all previous administrations combined. G W Bush topped his feat by doing likewise.<br>  <br>  To the questioner that wanted to know which industries Ronald Reagan deregulated;<br>  Health care, airlines, trucking, and finance are a few that come to mind immediatly.<br>  <br>  I believe the reason that conservatives are fighting back at accepting the truth about Ronald Reagan is because there is NO modern Republican president for them to point to as a man of accomplishment.|`|AfaFCiKxaa	You betcha.

The cause of today's problems is the government. You are saying that more government regulation and more control will solve all of our problems. Big government has worked so well before, right? I also don't understand how what Reagan did 25 years ago has anything to do with today's situation. We've had 3 presidents since then, 4 if you count Obama. Liberals look at today's mess and conclude that because we live in a capitalist society, therefore capitalism has failed and that the solution is a more powerful government.

Make sure you include some books by Milton Friedman - he was one of the best economic thinkers of our modern times.  <br>  <br>  I can understand why you may have your viewpoint.

And if he did have this super human power to keep America safe (which is false thinking as well, governments do not keep people safe) then why didn't he use this power on 9/11?<br>  <br>  Also does anyone find it odd that within 3 days of the attacks the media and the government contrived a myth about who, how and why 9/11 happened (which since has been entirely disproven) yet still 7 years later and countless dollars and lives we haven't found a single person who was responsible, Oh that's right the BBC located 7 of the supposed hijackers living in various countries.<br>  <br>  By the way to all those clamouring around the all protective snuggilly warmth of Daddy Bush, do you not think that it is a little silly to laud your worship on a politician. The comments are indicative of the propaganda heard in places like Nazi Germany and Cold War Russia. Big Brother keeps us all safe and we shall surely fall victim to the Boogey Man should our heroic father find disfavour with us. <br>  <br>  Grow up people, how many countries, with far more freedom and resources, don't get attacked? Quite a few. The government does not protect you it protects it self.

No one has ever claimed that he kept us safe by ignoring what happened on 9/11. 9/11 has always been acknowledged. What Bush did, was keep us safe from further attacks (the last failed attempt that I recall was the Fort Dix Six plot). He accomplished this even while Democrats were attacking his efforts at home. Granted, we were lucky with some of those thwarted attempts. Did Bush ever get the borders secure?  The answer is "no". (Is this even on Obama's list? I don't think so.)<br>  <br>  Even if you read the biased 9/11 Commission Report, they couldn't place all blame on the newly elected Bush. Our intelligence community was a mess after the Clinton administration got through with it. <br>  <br>  It's like Pearl Harbor. Yes, you can analyze the situation and see where we were weak under Roosevelt's watch, but we never had any major attacks after that. People didn't dwell on Pearl Harbor then, we shouldn't dwell on 9/11 now (and obviously the voters spoke at his re-election).|`|ASXeYOjAaa	By then, Clinton intelligence policy was still in place. Remember the phrase, "connecting the dots?" Connecting the dots was illegal. - NOT kidding.<br>  No "terrorist warnings" were ignored.

In the pre 9/11 reports, there was NO allusion to any particular date...akin to saying it will rain someday.  No info whatsoever.<br>  <br>  SO, imagine Bush's surprise when he finds a terrorist attack with a stripped-down military, courtesy of Clinton.  What should he have done?  Thrown himself in front of the towers?  What should he have done to read Osama's mind?<br>  <br>  Or are you one of the "Bush is an idiot" drones?|`|R9H2e1bBaa	Even if one credits Bush from learning from his mistakes and getting it, albeit too late for the twin towers and those left inside, one would still have to give more credit to the rest of the world, who cracked down on terrorist cells across the globe, and who shared accurate information that often contradicted our own with the incompetents in the CIA, FBI, and NSA, many of whom were hold-overs from Reagan, Bush I, and Clinton. The Iraq War was the best recruiting poster for Islamic terrorists that our money could buy.  Our chemical and hazardous waste sites remain virtually unguarded, and the sealed containers shipped here were not adequately investigated, because Bush II wanted less government, except when it came to tapping our phones, when more government was better.

The doctors scratch their heads, some saying, "The cancer has metastasized throughout the body," some saying, "It is localized and we can cut it out."  While the doctors scratch their heads, the presumptuous masses wail, and the termites ready the framework to a state of being "kindling."  Is there a magic core to the capitalistic economy that is going to ROAR and throw off those who tinker with the engine?   If it does, it will have to ROAR louder than greater than 50% of humans who want a mother-teat in the sky to give to them.  If it does not, most probably, the fire won't occur, because it will fall into a dreary, drab socialism by force of the termites, and excellence will be redefined.|`|VP1yQRwNaa	We didn't start the fire<br>  but the worlds been burnin<br>  since the worlds been turni

ZG62NNukaa	As you can see, no they can not.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Have you seen the stock market?  It reacts to everything Obama does and says, including that stimulus package.  The taxes, the unprecedented spending which will mean printing money since we have none, the inflation that will bring, the unemployment because of people hearing all of this news and just trying to ride it out, it is unbelievable the damage he has done in less than 2 months.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	Its already painfully obvious that Obama's campaign promises were just spit in the wind.  No more earmarks.  Apparently he just made up a new definition for the word.  He has no plan he can offer to stabalize the stock market.  My 401K is in bad shape and I'm over 60.  He needs to get a grip and offer a glimmer of real hope.  It isn't all about him.  People's lives are being radically changed yet this all seems to be a popularity contest to young people.  This is people's income they were depending on to finish their lives.  Obama's plans offer government money to get people through rather than immediately addressing our banking system and housing/credit problems.  I've heard no answers to those pressing problems.  Its not the far right or the far left or anything in between.  It is what is happening to people.  Ask someone who is presently living in a tent if they care about Obama's popularity polls.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	he quadrupled the debt.expanded welfare,taxing out small business which is the life blood of our country.more worried about rush than our 401k's.his cabinet is all criminals and tax cheats.lied about stopping earmarks.turbo tim is heading up the treasury while he can't figure out the difference between a 1099 and a w4.obama just paid off his student loans at 47 years old.now we know why he isn't bothered with strapping down 2 generations.and he thinks obamanomics will work when history already has proven this wrong.|`|G49lKR56aa	Reversing Bush is a starter!

The rich don't make enough money to pay for this Administrations Socialist Agenda without bankrupting every business in America.

Third answer in koolaid talking.  So Astro you clearly have the intellect to ask the question.  I will advise you to not use the word FAR Right because it shows a lack of understanding on your part.  The conservative movement is comparable to the Dem/Republicans vs the Federalist back when the country was founded.  Both sides in theory want to help people the current dems in office seem to think socialism will do that.  Conservatives believe it will do the opposite.  So does far right mean They really believe in individual liberty?  Does far left mean communism?  I think so but you seem to be saying far right means something negative and that make no sense.  How can too much freedom be a bad thing?<br>  <br>  So to answer your question.  Obama is in a short time has made moves that will lead us to a dictatorship and lose our superpower status.  Also he is reducing the size of the military so the likelihood of being attacked is going up.  This is a very scary time for rational people.  I hope you add yourself to the list.  <br>  <br>  Let all hope and pray the moderate democrats in the house and senate stop this mad man before its too late.

That is controversial as you say and that is why it's so popular. <br>  <br>  I mean who does fox news think they are giving us 'complete' news!! It's like they assume we want to think for ourselves. Your right! That is a no brainier.|`|nhWTN3uhaa	Okay it took you over 10 years to figure it out.  Now get back to us in 6 more years and let us know why Obama is such a disaster.

Wow how does he do that.

Hes doing very well for a disc Jockey in Sacramento,CA by attracting a large group of followers but then so did a German corporal named Adolf Hitler attract large groups of followers and created the Nazi party.

GUP7U6nvaa	-Actually they will call them if you put them on the application.  One of the reasons they do this is to see why you were rejected from a particular department (in other words: do they want to waste time on doing your background).<br>  <br>  It's been a long time but back in the day, departments also looked at how many other agencies you have applied for.  The academy tells you to apply everywhere until you get a job.  The problem with that is if you are rejected by too many agencies (which can happen for no particular reason) then other departments you apply for will wonder why you were rejected so many times and not even give you a chance and just reject you.  <br>  <br>  It's just a reality.<br>  <br>  -Tyris|`|aTLiaEGxaa	One reason I can think of is mainly for the background investigators.

Spending billions to prop up failed fatcat incompetent executives won't solve anything at all; we've all seen what they do with the money---bonuses, lavish parties, junkets, etc.<br>  <br>  Obviously, keeping incompetent execs who run their own companies into the ground won't turn the economy around.<br>  <br>  The companies need to crash, and get it over with quickly, so that these jerks can be replaced with competent people who want to succeed.<br>  <br>  This goes for Wall Street, the Detroit automakers, and even Congress needs to be overhauled.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Yes, during the Bush administration.|`|7mOfekBWaa	It depends on what you call booming.

AA10725805	I would go for it.  I have even thought of moving to Arizona.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	first of all we dont need a constitutional ammendment that would be done locally or by the state. <br>  <br>  go through the BILL process by contacting your representative and legislature and getting a petition signed. do your homework and find out how many signatures would be needed in your city and state. <br>  <br>  i think there are at least 2 cities and 1 state that do not change to daylight savings.|`|q5lreoiWaa	I don't know where you live, but where I live, daylight savings time is essential. I live in a very cold climate where in the winter the days are excessively short, Daylight savings kind of helps correct the getting up in the cold darkness and going to dinner in the same cold darkness.  So I hope that if you lobby for the repeal of this time adjustment, you are conscious  of the need to keep it local, and that also you are mindful of the needs of others.|`|g7fPDmmxaa	Yeah. We should pass an amendment to ban the natural processes behind global warmingtoo. (A.K.A Al Gore.)|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Only if enough people don't understand why we have daylight savings time.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I like it so I hope you are unsuccessful in your attempts to ban it.|`|3v9rL5xLaa	I wish! I hate it. Arizona doesn't have it, I guess we could all move there.|`|nhWTN3uhaa	What a great idea and use of our time.  But I have a better one.  Since everyone is so concerned about global warming how about if we pass a constitutional amendment that applies to the whole world not just the US that reduces the amount of sunlight that hits the earth by 5 mins per day.  In other words we will just have the son disapear for an extra 5 mins around the earth so the earth gets a chance to cool off a bit.  If it gets too cold we can reduce it to 2 mins.<br>  <br>  What do you guys think?  I think it will work...  I voted for Obama who did you vote for?

AA10199093	I've heard of Howard, but who is Rush? Are you talking about the Canadian rock band?  Do they even play anymore?  YYZ!|`|827t379Laa	who has more listeners? <br>  rush per week about 20 million<br>  stern per week about 12 million and that was before sirius radio. he has lost folowers.he is closr to 7-8 million now. i guess stern got paid. rush makes about 30 million a year and his audience is growing.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	Being that Rush is such a HUMBLE man, I'm quite sure he can live with $33 million a year and 590 affiliates.<br>  Besides, Howard's Salary is purely speculation.|`|hXwqKidraa	Sirius XM Radio Inc.(NasdaqGS: SIRI) is trading at 14 cents a share.|`|D5tIByciaa	Try 500M|`|Lfn2LOTzaa	Huh? I think they can both can be reasonably considered "successfull". I'll throw an analogy at ya'. It is like Howard has Lake Superior and Rush has Lake Erie (great lakes), they both have plenty of water. <br>  The question is, will *you* ever be as successful as EITHER of their butlers?|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Ha, ha, ha. Rush is doing one heck of a lot better then Stern and his sirus radio. Maybe you need to check your facts a little better.|`|RPeqzomsaa	I think even Howard Stern would tell you there is no way he has more listeners than Limbaugh. Limbaugh is being piped through just about every AM radio in the country. I'm not sure what Rush is pulling in, but seeing as how he travels in his own jet that rivals Air Force One, I'd have to guess it's a lot of dough. I think Rush missed the boat when he didn't let his show air on satellite. I don't listen to him because of it. I can't stand AM, it sounds awful.<br>  <br>  Also Howard got $500 million, for a five year deal. Out of that, he has to pay his staff, and all the other expenses. Yeah he's a rich guy, but the $500 million was a one time deal. Things will be real interesting to see what he does when that 5 years is over. Will Sirius have the money to offer? probably not. He's going to have to setlle for less. The other big deal coming up is XM's $500 million contract with Major League baseball. I hope that doesn't go away either.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Well, Rush is certainly good at letting loose a lot of unpleasant air; and that is how Howard got started. Reading about Rush and Howard in the same question reminds me of the good old days when we read about Bush II and Cheney in the same questions.

midmBgJJaa	Yes, I think your list is an excellent description of this disconcerting administration.<br>  <br>   The federal government is increasing in size while intervening much further in the private sector than in the past. I've yet to see the changes in the agricultural sector, but surely some variant will not be far behind - at least subsidies. As for 10, that is not an issue as it has already happened and it is beneficial for children. <br>  <br>  My biggest annoyances are a graduated tax and the continual growth of the government at the expense of private enterprise. At least 5 private sector jobs are needed to fund every 1 government job.<br>  <br>  Edit: WOW, this came from the Communist Manifesto? I'm surprised. Several of the points are dead on - the rest seem unlikely. But still, it's unnerving....<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, I voted for Obama but I didn't think he would spend so much, in so little time. I too am concerned and angry over these new taxes.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	this is obamas plan.|`|AA10719402	Yea yea.. the communist manifesto.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately your copy and paste job didn't make you realize how antiquated the language is.<br>  <br>  Especially references to agriculture.<br>  <br>  Perhaps if people read more about what Marx warned against and how it happened, people would understand that concentration of capital and "too big to fail" makes socialism possible... in turn communism.  Capitalism fosters the progression of socialism when unregulated.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Nah, martial law is much better.|`|igwzwx13aa	No.  Only even close to number 10.  Nice try though.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	No.  It is not a good Idea, Obama's proposals will destroy America. <br>  <br>  I used to laugh when Obama's opponents claimed he was in cahoots with the terrorists, and that Obama had obvious terrorist connections. <br>  <br>  Now I am starting to believe that their accusations may be true. <br>  <br>  Obama is certainly committing financial terrorism, at this point. <br>  <br>  After 9/11, the terrorists wrote that they would take away the freedoms Americans enjoy, one by one. <br>  <br>  Your list indicates that Obama's proposals are taking away freedoms. <br>  <br>  The Obama crew continually throws up smokescreens by making issues of non issues, so that the news stations do not cover Obama's socialist agenda. <br>  <br>  By the time people wake up and realize that none of these programs will improve the lifestyle of the average citizen, and may well worsen it for years and years, it will be too late.|`|Bu4XeFVPaa	It does to me.<br>  Obama and company need to be stopped, they are out of control and drunk with power.

AA11858035	I was a combat engineer, we spent most of our time in field. We would build bunkers and bridges, lay minefields, blow things up,,,,I loved it, you got a rifle in one hand and a hammer in the other. Combat engineer is not for everyone, if you're not an outdoors type of guy you won't like it. Combat engineers are also front line combat troops, they go in with the first wave.|`|e37b10dd9e41a3d4d901feab990b7e9daa	Go medical. I get to go everywhere and get trained for a good civilian job. Xray tech, Lab tech, PT or OT tech. All great jobs. Most of the training qualifies for college credits. OT, xray and lad gets to sit for their national boards after training completion. PT is about 15 credits short of a degree. Signal has some great jobs too.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	Infantry because it has the most pride.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Getting almost any job in the Army depends on four things: Your ASVAB score, the results of your physical, your moral (law and credit) qualifications, and the availability of the job (some jobs might be full at the time you try to enlist).  Without your ducks in a row it will limit what you can qualify for.<br>  <br>  I'm willing to bet that you were told recruiters were liars either by people who never been in the military or by people who had "selective hearing" when they talked to a recruiter.  Selective hearing is when you tell someone "You will get a $40,000 bonus if you qualify and enlist in a designated skill (go back to the first paragraph)" and they tune out everything after the word bonus.  They when they don't qualify for a job offering the bonus they get mad and say the recruiter lied to them.<br>  <br>  It isn't feasible for a recruiter to lie.  One, because it is punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice if they are caught.  Two, because if a recruiter lies to you to get you in and you find out he lied during basic, what are you going to do?  You're going to call your mother during your phone time and tell her how your recruiter lied to you.  Then she is going to tell her church, the school, etc. and they will spread the word until that recruiter who lied has a bad reputation.  Then nobody is going to want to talk to him because of his reputation and his 36 month recruiting tour is going to be hell, unless he gets relieved sooner.<br>  <br>  As for what is the best job, it depends on what YOU want to do.  Some people think being an 11B is the best because they want to be in the middle of action.  Others think that being a 42A is the best for the paperwork.  There are over 150 jobs to choose from, so you should find something you want to do.<br>  <br>  As for their pay, that depends on their pay grade.  They get their base pay, BAH for their area (NYC BAH for an E-6 is over $2000 right now, for example) BAS, and $450 of special duty pay for being a recruiter.  So depending on their area they might make close to that.|`|XA69SIvnaa	13F Forward Observer for enlisted or 13A for Officers (and try to be a FSO). <br>  <br>  Don't listen to some of these non-hackers who were never in the Army! You can tell who they are with their long explanations and inability to describe jobs they performed. Or they are just soft skill jobs that never go outside the wire in Iraq! We call them fobbits! They just draw a combat paycheck and drink green mountain coffee everyday sitting in an A/Ced office.<br>  <br>  I enlisted as a 13F then had the pleasure of being branched the same once I became an officer. By far the best MOS in the Army, we lead the way in PT, intelligence, and are treated like demigods on the company level. Nobody has command and control authority over us except our brigade commander and his staff. This equals a lot of lattitude in our day to day lives. Our immediate chain of command exists for administrative purposes only (i.e. tracking if we are present, leave forms, etc.) If you want a job that has all the action and want to do something besides pretend like you're in a war in Iraq with all the other fobbits than sign up as a combat arms job.<br>  <br>  Ask any infantryman what MOS is his favorite besides their own - they will definately tell you FISTERs are the guys to goto. This job is much more dangerous and challenging than that of an infantryman. Some say only the eccentric and crazy sign up for it, so it leads to meeting some cool individuals. <br>  <br>  Goto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_observer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_obs...</a> there's kind of a juiced up article about us. But it says some things. Good luck finiding a job. Oh and by the way. Do you live in Manhattan? An E-7 with dependents + recruiter pay would easily make that much working in the city.|`|bMLg87pMaa	Not Infantry;because, there's are no civilian jobs for that MOS, and all you learn is leadership and to kill.  I was Army Infantry and wish I joined the Air Force or Navy.  It depends on what you like to do.  Do you like aircraft or auto mechanics, finance, etc.  I cant tell you what job is good and what job is bad.  It depends on you and only you.  Make sure you research every MOS in the Army they give you.  When you go to MEPS, your job counciler may lie to you about the jobs you want.  The recruiter does make that much because he's been in for 5 or more years and is a E5 or above. Make sure every thing is in writing before you sign.  Ask a lot of questions.  Make sure you know what your getting yourself into. Don't trust everything your recruiter tells you, because his job is to get you in the Army, Thant's it.  I been out of Army for a year now.  I am getting into the Navy reserves to be a Seabee Builder now.  Me, I did not like the Army and Infantry.  The people were horrible.  Some people were good but those were the ones getting out of the Army.  I don't know you, so its up to you and the decisions you make. P.S. Do what Job and service you want to do, not what your recruiter or counciler wants you to do, and make sure to read before you sign.|`|vZBamKqiaa	68K<br>  <br>  Medical Lab Technician<br>  <br>  I will toot the horn.<br>  <br>  I got an Associates Degree and a Bachelors Degree from George Washington University by going through the program.<br>  <br>  There are a lot more details that your recruiter can give you.<br>  <br>  But, the 'best' job in the army according to anyones opinion is not going to help you.  You have to find out what your interests are and what your goals are.  You have to love what you are doing every day.  Then, you will have the best job in the army.|`|fyWbMXOHaa	If you have taken the ASVAB and then he told you that, then he is more then likely not lying that you qualify. If you have not, then he is just guessing. You can talk to him about what you would like to do etc. but your won't know what you qualify for until you take the ASVAB. <br>   His pay depends on allot so it is hard to tell you that. Rank, BAH, BAS, dependents, bonus. But don't worry about his pay worry about what ours will be. <br>  As far as what's the best MOS in the Army, that all depends on the person. Pick something that interests you, and you are comfortable doing for a long time. I can tell you my job is the best, but them 20 people will just come along and tell you why theirs is better. Bottom line is the job you think is best will be best for you.|`|d117226cff9e65399c2226c82fd237a5aa	CinC|`|3xTNOevjaa	infantry, b/c most action.<br>  He could be telling the truth, he is a "recruiter" afterall. <br>  He gets alot of bonuses if he recruits alot, and I'm probably sure his rank is high at the same time.

They had a great opportunity when the Dems were out of power and blew it. This has been going on for years and years and no one did anything.  Certainly not the bought off oversight committee headed by Democrat Chris Dodd.|`|Jq5WK8caaa	No, they blame Democrats because they where in charge of most of the bank, home loan and other economic regulators.  Can you say Barny Frank?  Oh no, you can't blame a gay congressmen.  Yes I can, he was responsible for oversight and regulation.  Barny Frank assisted ACORN in security sub prime loans for those who couldn't pay for them.  So when you rely on facts, it was Barny Frank who failed and prevented the Republicans from preventing disaster.  But then again you can't blame Barny Frank, I mean he was getting kick backs and his Boy toy worked for Fanny May/Freddie Mac for what he wasn't doing, his JOB.  But I guess that was Republicans fault for letting Barny Frank abuse his power huh???   It all started with Fanny and Freddie, the Democrats used there power to create a economic disaster.  Sure your in the government know, but I doubt most responsible Americans will abandon this drum beat for the heads of those Democrats responsible for not doing there JOBS.  For not protecting the American people.  It will come to pass under a republican president who uses the same rhetoric your great messiah Barrack Obama.  Barny Frank will be sent to jail for his pay to play, accepting liberal kick backs, having inappropriate relationships with members of company he was suppose to be regulating and not doing his job.   And no its not because he is gay either, I will sent them to war and expect them to do there jobs just the same.

He now wants to sign another one they are calling this one the 2009 BUDGET Bill.  He has not signed it yet.  Its hard to keep them straight, because there will be another bill after this one to bail out the prior stimulus bill that was supposed to prevent the the other stimulus bill that took place because the Bush Stimulus bill didn't work...

It also doesn't seem to have any deterrent effect.  If you look at countries with and without the death penalty, those without do not have higher rates of capital crimes.  The death penalty is basically about vengeance.

When you actually listen to the tape of the Steele interview when he said what he did about Limbaugh, it is very obvious that the question caught him off-guard and he IMMEDIATELY realized that he misspoke. He was actually trying to set the record straight right then... without any prodding from the RNC... but Hugley had gotten the sound-bite that he wanted and cut him off. Limbaugh has helped Steele in the past, and Steele knew he OWED Limbaugh an apology. Being a man of integrity, he did it. <br>  <br>  Limbaugh has moved on and accepted the apology... maybe you should too.

Our society has an anxiety problem and a lot of it is fueled by the media. When the constitution was written they did not invent the machine gun or any other large gun that can blow away a large group of people. So if they want to regulate gun laws so that people cannot get a MACHINE GUN the media will say guns they are trying to get everyday guns.

We have excessive gun control in the US. <br>  <br>  The problems you cite result from a tiny minority who lack SELF control.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	There's actually a lot of gun control  compared to what there should be.  Those countries don't have a constitution that garauntees them the right to bear arms.  Since that right isn't supposed to be infringed upon the fact that there is gun control is more than what there should be.  I don't know how many guns you own, but I think you'll be hard pressed to find an uzi or an M4 in wall mart, mostly because I doubt that they are a class 3 firearms dealer.  With the mentally ill and criminals I don't think their gun rights should be infringed either, I know this is a contraversial view, but the fact is if 80% of citizens own firearms and carry them, a few people who are mentally ill or criminals will not overpower them, it's just numbers.  I think a lot of the calls for gun control in the wake of things like this is people using impassioned events to get what they ultimately wanted.  I feel like we should attack something like this at the root causes, not deal with a simptom, because for us to be effective at this we would have to take a more heavy handed approach.  In dealing with the mentally ill, I have been pushing for SSRI and SSNI antidepressants be removed from controlled substance listings so they can be purchased over the counter in 5 states on the east coast.  I think that if that happens that more people that need these medications can get to the help that they need more readily and it will prevent events like this from occurring.  I also think there should be a repeal of the Brady Bill, because it punishes people who would otherwise be allowed to buy a firearm, we now have 15 minute background checks there is no reason for us to make it any harder than what it is.  See I do believe that things like that shouldn't happen, but I don't believe in taking away the rights of law abiding citizens.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	interesting isn't it??<br>  <br>  US leads the world in gun crime... leads the world in car robberies.. both of which are crimes with victims.. hmmm <br>  <br>  so how is it that the US is 15'th of 20 in crime victims per capita??<br>  <br>  Total crime victims    21.1%       [15th of 20] <br>  Well behind most of the EU...<br>  <br>  we <The US> don't understand how countries that fought long and hard against tyranny can allow themselves to be disarmed;  however it is YOUR country so we see no need to question if it is a good thing.. yalls experiment yall do it your way...<br>  <br>  my real confusion comes in why you feel he need to try to change us to be more like you??? thought we made it pretty clear when we left your countries we really didn't want to be much like yal.. and in fact would rather do it our own way.|`|6OLiuM9Gaa	In the US we have this constitutional provision, to wit:<br>  "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, as children are wont to do, many people interpret (misinterpret) it to suit their own selfish interests. They seem only capable of remembering the last half of the Amendment. They take the Amendment to mean, "I can own any kind of weapon and can carry it anywhere I want."<br>  <br>  Men mistake the size and power of the weapon they own for testosterone. Somehow, the power it gives them -- and you have to admit that a weapon does give its wielder a measure of power -- makes up for their inherent lack of masculinity. <br>  <br>  They say, "I need it to protect my home." Bull stuff. You don't need an automatic weapon, or one with a range of a mile and a half, or with a muzzle velocity of 1100 fps, to protect your home. If you're that insecure, move... or maybe get yourself committed. It's people like that that make others think they need bigger and more powerful weapons. For most, home protection is best accomplished with a shotgun. The discharge makes a lot of noise letting people you need help. The projectiles probably won't leave your house... where you want the protection. And you really don't have to be all that proficient. Now, if you live in the neighborhood of Kodiak bears, then maybe you might need a .44 Magnum, but there aren't too many of those neighborhoods. And those neighborhoods aren't so densely populated that a stray bullet might injure or kill a human neighbor.<br>  <br>  "I'm a hunter." If you hunt for "sport", and you need an automatic weapon, or one that has an effective range of a half a mile, where's the sport in that? Want sport, take a pocket knife and go hunting one of those Kodiak bears. Now there's sport. You're quicker, probably less ponderous. He's bigger and stronger. He won't run away and you can't. And both your lives are on the line.<br>  <br>  If you hunt for food... and hardly any do anymore... remember that before the advent of firearms, people did rather well with bow and arrow. Maybe you could take up fishing.<br>  <br>  "But I have a Constitutional right..." Again, the Constitution of the United States of America states, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  Now, if you're attached to a "well regulated Militia," yes, the Constitution does provide for you to own and carry a weapon. But it doesn't mean that any moron who has qualms about his masculinity, or any paranoid, or anybody else for that matter, has the right.<br>  <br>  One of the problems in the United States is that lawyers aren't very smart. Oh, they know the law and are pretty good at interpreting (misinterpreting) it to suit them, they really have not idea about the intent of the law... and they probably don't care.<br>  <br>  Back when the Constitution was written (in the late 1700s) the United States didn't have a standing Army. They needed to count on their citizens for voluntary support when military might was deemed necessary. Since they didn't have the ability to tax (that was written into the Constitution too), they couldn't afford to stockpile weapons for the people to use in defense of their nation. Hence, the second Amendment. That's what it's for.<br>  <br>  Now so many think it's license to use weapons to settle family dispute, to resolve arguments with neighbors, or to deal with issues at school or work, that we have a host of other laws on the books ostensibly to protect us from ourselves.<br>  <br>  No, you can't walk into the local WALMART and pick up a UZI or M4. Theoretically you can't walk into any store and just pick up a weapon and walk out. In most cases there's a 10-day "waiting period" in which a background check is made to determine whether or not you're insane or a criminal. But there are ways around that. You don't have to buy a weapon at a store. You can steal one. Or you can get purchase one illegally. Or you can purchase a "legal" weapon and make it illegal by making modifications to it. Or you can make one. Some kids use their parents' weapons. Some parents provide them. We have a lot of idiots in the US. And they're self-centered idiots who can't seem to get it through their thick skulls that the rules apply to them too... or maybe they're too dumb to care.<br>  <br>  We have gun control. Probably way more than we should need. But if you don't want to obey the law you don't care, so it really doesn't do much good. Were there a statute that if one owned a weapon, of any kind, even a pocket knife, and committed a crime, it was a capital offense, even that would do nothing. One would think that would be a deterrent. But we have those lawyers who are so good at interpreting (misinterpreting) the law, we have guys who have been on "death row" for decades and who will probably die of old age having been cared for by the society they endangered; and there's the probably hundreds of thousands who just haven't been caught, or who have escaped the law on a technicality... again, thanks to those lawyers.<br>  <br>  Anyway,  that's my take on the situation. Granted, my exposure to the US is somewhat limited. I've only lived here all my life.... almost 70 years of it. I was in the "well regulated Militia" for a quarter of a century. So what do I know?|`|RvS5YcPQaa	Your numbers are SO far off.  Australias violent crimes rose 51% in its first year of gun control.  Englands violent crime rate soared 44% and those were gun crimes!  Its not the guns!! Jeezus I am tired of people blaming the the phucking guns.  If the azzhole pulling the trigger wasnt there, then the gun wouldnt go off now would it?  I have my share of guns, and a couple are the ones you seem to dispise. My guns never leave the home except for target practice or hunting.  My handgun only leaves the house when I am going for a walk.  It stays strapped to my side in plain view for everyone to see.  It makes some nervous and makes some feel more comfortable.  But it has NEVER led anyone to try and mug or attack me.<br>  <br>  Then again, guns are out of control.  I mean, I lay in bed at night and I hear them getting rowdy in my gun cabinet.  Sometimes I feel as though they are gonna get out of there and come get me.<br>  <br>  As far as the Uzi and the M-4 goes, the Uzi is considered a pistol requiring the paperwork necessary in each state to get a handgun.  And yes, you can get an semi-automatic M-4 at Wal-mart.  The M-4 is legally defined as a long gun, nothing special. All you have to do is fil out the paperwork for the background check like for all other guns except blackpowder. The fully automatic version is a class 3 license item which you can own, just alot of unecessary red tape.<br>  <a href="http://www.opencarry.org/maps.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.opencarry.org/maps.html</a>      This is a good website for those who are curious about some of the gun laws in your state.<br>  <br>  Hey BigBad, the second amendment was formed to help the citizens defend against a tyrannical government, whether it be a foreign one or our own.  It wasnt to just to defend against the possibility of a British invasion.  The colonies were British therefore they could not invade their own, only try and take it back.  By the time the Constitution was written, 1787, we had already defeated the British by 4 years.  The comma in the second amendment is the source of contention in the deifintion of the Second Amendment.  Whether people like it or not, the Supreme court made their decision as too what the second amendment means.  It means WE as citizens have the right to bear arms.  And they didnt say just pistols or rifles.  They left it open for one reason.

Our guns are used for sports such as hunting, target shooting, even protection should the need arise.  We like our access to what we need or want and we don't need nor want the government deciding that for us, I seriously doubt that any of the domestic ownership of our guns has ever been a threat to you and yours, and it will not be a threat to you unless you pose us a threat, in that instance dear friend, you can see what we mean when we say we keep our guns for our pleasure as well as our protection!|`|K8qAniReaa	You can walk into Walmart and buy a gun.

The idea was supposed to be that community men would train together to prepare for any possible invasion (like from the English) in order to do that they had to keep their weapons at home.  This was actually supposed to be the National Guard.  Now the National Guard has gotten funding from the federal government and people are complacent with local and federal government invasions.<br>  <br>  Instead of following the original purpose for having militias for guns now people have guns for funzies and to protect them from robbery even though they are more likely to shoot a family member than to shoot a robber.

Here is what I found from the NJ workers compensation website:     <br>  <br>        What are the time limits for filing a claim with the Division?<br>  <br>          There is two-year statute of limitations that applies to workers' compensation cases.  A formal claim petition must be filed within two years of the date of injury or the date of last payment of compensation, whichever is later.  Medical treatment authorized by the employer is considered a payment of compensation.  In cases of occupational illness, for example - asbestosis, lead poisoning or hearing loss, the claim petition must be filed within two years from the date the worker first became aware of the condition and its relationship to employment.  Please note that the filing of an application for an informal hearing does not stop the two-year statute of limitations from running.|`|lqXmvJdRaa	Go and talk to a compensation lawyer. You have no other options.|`|FA1l64EOaa	I used to handle workers comp claims as an adjuster in NJ.  Your rights were violated and your boss clearly took advantage of you.  You should take this matter to a work comp attorney ASAP and file a claim petition.  The bottom line is that you were injured on the job and the liability is on your company.  The good thing is that Work Comp judges in NJ are VERY sympathetic to employees, NOT to employers.  Which means that your employer won't have a prayer if your case is heard.  Like I said, take it to a comp attorney.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are still going to work, you seriously risk further aggravation of your injury to your back.  Take it to a comp attorney and tell them exactly what you wrote in your question.  Get on this ASAP and take care of yourself.

Do you know all the families that collect welfare? Do you know why they are on welfare and what keeps them on from getting a job? Have you ever thought about learning more about it than just stereotyping the entire group? You need to look into why they are on Welfare then base a little more on the truth than just how you feel. <br>  <br>  With that being said I do believe that many of the families who are on Welfare should not be. It is "supposed" to be temporary but in many cases it can be prolonged due to a lot of different things. The rules have never been enforced just as with Unemployment. There are rules for everyone to follow who are on both of them, and yet, how many do?<br>  <br>  Welfare has requirements of what a family can make a year. If a family is over that amount by $.01 they do NOT qualify. It is humiliating.

pss8LblLaa	Different strokes for different folks really.  Example: Mountain Home AFB Idaho.  Most people probably would avoid it like the plague.  It's cold, kinda remote, and small.  But for folks who like winter, outdoor activites (hunting, camping, hiking, skiing) and prefer a smaller country type life, they love it.  Best thing to do is think about what things you like to do or what things you would want to do or see.  Of all of the U.S. bases I've been stationed at, Hickam AFB Hawaii was the best although it's not on the mainland.  Of the mainland bases I've had, Travis AFB CA was best followed by McGuire AFB NJ.  They were both good based on proximity to major metropolitan areas, Travis (San Francisco, Sacramento) and McGuire (Philadelphia, New York City, Atlantic City).|`|lwZPBTLPaa	I would say patrick is the best.

King James the III would be impressed, it took him years to move the American people to open protest of government.  It only took Barrack Obama months.  For those of you who can, don't send in your tax checks or payments on April 15th, protest taxation without representation.  Denounce the common good and promote the common man.  It is freedom we are defending and freedom will always be Americas choice.  Stop supporting senators and house representatives that seek to take away our rights of secret ballots, that seek to destroy our communities and our private businesses.  On April 15th send emails, protest in the streets let your voice be heard by our government that they are not doing there sacred jobs.  Overwhelm there offices with phone calls, fill there emails up with letters of disadifaction over the failure to do there jobs.  Call for justice on Barney Frank, Chriss Dodd and Harry Reid.  Let the vioce be heard loud and clear.  Americans voted for change on November the 4th and all we have seen is more of the same.  We have seen a government working against the people who elected them and acting ill responsibly.  Robbing future generations of there income, robbing our hard earned taxes, destroying the Americans dollar with all the excess money they have printed.  Let them know we will not allow them to destroy our great nation and take our rights away from us.  Let our voices be heard load and clear on April the 15th.  Let them know the direction that you want to country to move in.  Let it be known.  If they should not listen move even more aggressively, start actions to impeach those who continue to ignore We the people, send them out of office and out of our government.  Send a clear message that We the People run the government and they are not good stewards of that sacred responsibility, the sacred oath and duty they where sworn to act on the behalf of the people, for the people and by the people.  Remind the government that elections are not held every few years, but every day as there actions reflect there loyalties.  Show American the hope and dreams of this great nation.   April the 15th will be known as the United States freedom tax party.
DDbWKBKjaa	It's a pretty controversial issue right now.<br>  <br>  I think you'd be hard-pressed to characterize it as a separate legal system.  Even contractually-created legal proceedings (think: arbitration) are governed very closely by statutory and regulatory authority.  So while there are folks who choose to govern their disputes by reference to Sharia law, that dispute resolution isn't likely to be considered a legal proceeding, in the Canadian sense of the phrase.<br>  <br>  There was a move to create official Sharia Tribunals in Ontario a couple years back; that didn't fly.  The trouble is that there are deep concerns about how Sharia law approaches gender, and as a practical matter it isn't clear how these concerns can be addressed.

AA11672256	I failed to comprehend the essence of your question.<br>  <br>  Regarding a Ration Card a person (in your case, the Revenue Officer) does any of the following:<br>  <br>  1. Applies for a card, if he/she doesn't have one.<br>  2. The guardian applies for a change from a "Child/Minor" class Ration Card to an "Adult" class when his/her child completes the age of 12 years (probably not applicable in this case).<br>  3. Applies for a change in name/surname, change in address with or without a change in the ration shop/ration office or change of guardian. These changes are mostly applied for by women after their marriage.<br>  <br>  In your case, the application probably relates to Serial No. 1 or 3. The Revenue Officer does not possess a card or might have lost it. Or he/she wants a change in the address on account of his/her transfer to his/her present location. All of these require certain forms to be filled and copies of certain documents to be enclosed. The latter is essentially a proof of the applicant's identity and his/her Indian citizenship.<br>  <br>  If the Revenue Officer still requires a "No Objection" certificate and you are the issuing authority, ask him/her, as to whether the Ration Office has any specified proforma for such certificates. If there is none, simply state that your organisation has no objection against Shri/Smt.

Obama is a New World Order puppet just like George Bush. If he doesnt follow their plan all they have to do is release his birth certificate or other proof and there goes his presidency. He then becomes the man that got busted conning America. He obviously doesnt want that to happen. Hes going to do whatever they ask him to do. Everything I see Obama do just worries me more and more. He toys with the minds of the people and it really pisses me off. Like saying he wants to close Guan Bay while passing National Emergency Centers Act or HR 645. Which authorizes the legal creation of "detainment camps" aka concentration camps.(yes legal, its been done for a long time but Bush did it illegally) 800 camps are already known so far.

I agree with you on abortion and the idiotic conspiracy theories, but assuming that some countries have nukes, isn't unilateral disarmament (or forced unilateral disarmament) wrong because more countries with nukes tends to have a deterrent effect on their use (obviously, I'm in favor of eliminating nukes entirely), as long as those countries don't intend to use them (and I think it is absurd to say that Iran intends to nuke their neighbors; in fact, our government's intelligence estimates say that Iran abolished their nuclear weapon program about 5 or 6 years ago).<br>  <br>  I believe we should just cut off all foreign aid and entangling alliances with other countries.

I can walk to Walgreens, several restaurants, a grocery store, a video rental business and ride my bike to even more places.  I guess I just like that I don't have to go far to get what I need.  The only downfall is that since it is a college town I am surrounded by all the bars, and so thursday, friday, and saturday are really loud at night.  Here is how I'd list my importance.<br>  <br>  Location (in the town)<br>  Community <br>  Friends<br>  Family<br>  Cheap living expenses<br>  <br>  Downfall:<br>  Noisy at night<br>  Not a lot to do here, have to travel at least half an hour for decent entertainment or shopping.
HaviqgZjaa	Your neighbour would not be legally responsible.  <br>  <br>  He would certainly have no liability in criminal law, and although you could sue him in a civil action I don't think you would succeed (you would have to demonstrate that his actions directly caused you to be the victim of the robbery, and that clearly wouldn't be the case).  Even in the very unlikely event you did succeed, the only thing he might be liable for would be the damage caused by the pickaxe (ie not for the value of any stolen items).|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	I think your neighbour is a bit of a pratt.

If he were to sign that affidavit that would be your grounds for terminating the relationship.<br>  <br>  That being said however, I doubt seriously a judge would terminate unless there is an adiption in the works, and if they guy says he wants to be part of the kids life it is doubtful the judge will say, "Terminating the parental rights is in the best interest of the child" unless there are other circumstances life family violence ets.|`|mgS8aV6kaa	well, you could try but, allot of times if  you report it they will garnish his check now and he will not see the money as it will be taken out of his check and given to you,talk to your lawyer and haul him into court then have the cost asscociated with  your fees tact on to him..<br>  <br>  read this over....just copy and paste to google <br>  <br>  //www.helpyourselfdivorce.com/texas-ch...|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	If he is late by $1800 after paying regularly before, you could just be rubbing salt into the wound with taking visitation away from him.<br>  It may also effect your relationship with your kids.<br>  If they love him (because he will always be their dad, whether a piece of paper says so or not), they they may resent you getting him to sign over rights for so little.

RvS5YcPQaa	If you run into snags going through the normal channels, contact your congressman, seriously.  I have used my congressman 3 times now and each time he has come through for me, and all three times it has had something to do with a problem with federal gov or military.  As far as the pain goes, I dont want to sound like a witch doctor or anything but I have been having problems with my joints and numbness in all my extremities due to the p-tabs we were given during the first gulf war.  The p-tabs were the 'antidote' for the chemical and biological weapons we were supposed to be faced with that eventually was the driving force behind the investigation into gulf war sickness.  Anyways, I am using a bottle of stuff called zeolite.  After about two weeks I was feeling better than I ever was.  If you want a link to it let me know.  Good luck and thank him for his service for me.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I am also a 90% Viet Nam veteran. For VA the minimum disability for diabetes is 20% and that is only for taking pills. VA recognizes diabetes as service connected for anybody who has served in Viet Nam.  If his disability is for diabetes and he is taking insulin, he should put in claim to VA to increase disability, Is his joint pain related to diabetes? That should be mentioned to.  If he get rated 50% by VA he can then apply what the VA calls unemployibility.  That means the move his percentage to 100% which under present rates pays about $2700.00 per mo. He need to talk to state service officers for either American Legion, VFW, DAV o Am Vets.  Any additional help needed VA wise feel free to e-mail me. My son has claims pending with VA and they told him their was a 12 month backlog.  VA disability and Social Security disability are completely separate.

7e45ea9e2cad770cb7a1dd48907df0a9aa	No. President Obama can't be the Antichrist.  He's not love by everyone. Since Obama wants to get out of Iraq, he can't be the Antichrist.   ><<br>  <br>  The Antichrist – 1 John 2:18 <br>  The Beast – Revelation 13:18, 17:12-17, 19:19-21. The Antichris doesn mean it's a man. It's could be a female.  Please read the bible for yourself, get save and get your life right with our Lord. <br>  <br>  It is my belief that the church will not discover the identity of the Antichrist as we will be raptured before he is revealed.  However, when a seven year covenant of peace is confirmed with Israel, those on earth may know who he is.<br>  <br>  Take note that the Antichrist is not necessarily the man who initially establishes the peace treaty, but rather he is the one who confirms it.  As part of the peace treaty, Israel will be able to rebuild the temple and begin sacrificing once again.<br>  <br>  What do we know about the Antichrist?  He will appear to be the best the world has to offer in speech, military genius, economics, and philosophy.  A sinful world will be extremely welcome to his ideas and his leadership.  Of his personality we know he will be:<br>  <br>  A great orator and demagogue – Daniel 7:8 <br>  A speaker with regal authority – Revelation 13:2 <br>  A philosopher of distinction who traffics in deception – Daniel 8:23 <br>  A clever and persistent politician – Daniel 8:25 <br>  A deceiver who will use the false religious system to gain power – Revelation 13:1-18 <br>  A military genius – Daniel 7:8, 24 Revelation 6:1-2 <br>  A man different from other men – Revelation 13:4, Daniel 7:7,19,23 <br>  A highly intelligent man – Daniel 7:8 <br>  A perfection of unholiness “666” – Revelation 13:18 <br>  A man who will look more imposing that other rulers – Daniel 7:20 Revelation 13:3-4, 17:8 <br>  A last wonder of the world – Revelation 13:3-4 <br>  <br>  The signs point to the fact that the Antichrist may be alive on this earth this very day.  But we will not know who he is until he declares himself.  By then, the church will be safely raptured away.  But those saved after the rapture may know his identity immediately once he confirms a 7 year treaty with Israel and allows sacrifices to begin again on the temple mount.<br>  <br>  The Middle East is a tinder box ready to ignite.  Never has there been such a loud cry for peace as there is today.  There will be one man who promises and actually delivers it.  But it will be a false peace.  Real peace will come when the Prince of Peace establishes His kingdom on earth.  <br>  <br>  May that day be soon.|`|e9z5oVKPaa	No, but he is going to accomplish the same thing, unless people stand up.|`|0fRsWy05aa	No. President Obama isn't the antichrist and you're not an Obama supporter.

Just like a job on a contract -- which is really what most military is -- you keep working while pregnant, but you might get moved to less risky work in the meantime, if your condition requires it.  For example, if your job involves a lot of heavy lifting, you might be sent to a desk job; if you're at a desk job, you'd just stay at your desk.<br>  <br>  Deciding you want out doesn't mean you get out.  You signed a contract; trying to break the contract means penalties, and with this kind, it generally is more severe than "We'll tell any potential employers that you broke your contract"... If you jump ship anyway, this can even include jail time.  And yes, you would lose all benefits.<br>  <br>  If the military weren't in such desperate need of personnel now, your superiors might be willing to work with you; but now they need every warm body they can scrape up, so it becomes even more difficult to leave.  Even a lot of folks who thought they were inactive have been called back to duty.   You could try asking your superior officer to see if there's anything they can do to help, but don't hold your breath.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Pregnancy is no longer grounds for requesting discharge.

I dont know in your Country but in Australia we have 100 points to form ID. These can be made up of bank statements, bills showing your name and address, health care card, passport, birth certificate, letter from employer or school etc. Tax File returns, and each one is worth a certain number of points, You should be able to get details of this points system from your social security system as to what you need if this is in effect.<br>  <br>  Good luck but you can thank all those fraudsters for this.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	You can get an original birth certificate by calling the city and state you were born in.

Also, even with an expired military ID you may be able to go to the Veterans Administration or the VA hospital and get a new card. It would be a VA card but that is a valid for mof ID.

Also, if she is pregnant and due in a few months, what kind of person would that make you if you were to kick her out? No offense, but that's pretty harsh. <br>  <br>  Renting is a headache and probably always will be. I'd wait until the lease was up and sell it.|`|AA11315360	I suggest taking her to small claims court for the additional rent she has not paid and all the past bills and sue for court cost (which is about 20 dollars to file).<br>  Send her a letter giving her 30 or 60 days to leave stating you are selling the property.

4IC78le4aa	The stimulus packages that are currently being designed by our Governments differ depending on what Country you live in but all have the basic principles in mind. The Government is injecting loads of cash into the economy through people and businesses in an attempt to raise the levels of the current economy slump through consumers not being in a financial position to buy anything. So, by injecting money into different areas, this allows different bodies and citizens to use the money to buy things that they need and in using local businesses to do this, it raises the spending for that term and this in turn, apparently lifts the level of finances around the country. In Australia, our Government is giving around $1000 for a second time in 6 months to the people of Australia each so that they can go and buy things (1st package was just before Christmas because no one was buying anything and businesses were suffering at what is normally the busiest period of the year for consumer goods. Now, it is just before Easter. Schools and Councils are being given a stackload of cash to buy but they have a list of who they can buy from  - generally it is to support your local community businesses and boost their sales. Schools are using funds to build additional classrooms, buy computers, install playgrounds, basketball courts, fitness equipment, sun shade, books for the library - whatever they desire but it has to be pre approved by the Government to make sure they are adhering to the guidelines. Councils will also benefit with contributions for park upgrades, community projects etc.  Back to school allowances are being given to families and most people receiving some sort of benefit  including the Family Tax Benefit as at last December will qualify for this money. It is a huge family boost to people who are out of work and really struggling financially and at the same time it helps all small and bigger businesses keep in business and thus, assisting them in not having to make staff redundant because they are not selling.<br>  <br>  Having said that, it wont work for everyone and not everyone is elligible.|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	America's fast plummett into Socialism.<br>  <br>  It doesn't help us, it helps the government gain control over corporations.  <br>  <br>  Did you know they created a new governemnt position- the secratary of Health information Technology.  The purpose is to create a national database with our medical records, which is government controlled.  The person in this position is supposed to analyze medical treatments and decide what can be afforded and what treatments are nessacary and what ones are not.  <br>  <br>  I watched the press conference where the President was signing the stimulus package and everyone was cheering and I could not help but think of a line from Star Wars episode 3-  "and this is how liberty dies, at the sound of thunderous applause"|`|fm39D2Omaa	Gives lots of money to big corps. thinking it with 'trickle' down and make spending increase so the economy will go back to normal, but this is a stupid idea and money should be used for healthcare, not making the rich richer.|`|svYiQZUHaa	It is the robin hood scenario. but instead of robbing from the rich he is going to rob from the working class and give to the lazy azz poor people that don't want to work and and also is giving to the rich.|`|gWX21Jtwaa	It will make a few very very rich.<br>  that is about it.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	it doesnt help. how many have we had so far. look at the economy now. its there because we are bitching.

Without one you may not get it at all. A lawyer would prove that you no longer can work if it's true. A judge will say hey you can do this job or that job and that will be the end. My husband had a very good lawyer and got SSI on the first try for a major back injury. That is the best advice I can give you.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	absolutely yes! most people i know whose on disability were time and time again denied, but if you get a lawyer or already have one they usually win your case for you. its a lengthy and stressful ordeal but your lawyer if good will handle it all for you, and get you what you need. good luck with everything!|`|AA11031560	If your case proves to be strong enough to convince the law judge, yes you will receive benefits, if the law judge is not convinced, you won't get benefits.

3eb0DIxGaa	Society, and insurance companies allready do this. Smoking is taxed to the hilt. If you overeat, you still have to pay for the extra food. The activity I feel should have greater penalties is the addictive consumption of alchohol.   From robbing your health, and your wealth, to killing others in a drunken stupor with a car or gun. Alchohol is bad.|`|epbzW5N8aa	Smoking, they already do. Compare insurance rates. Then there is smoking illegal drugs we all know if these people get caught they have to pay. Eating, the already do , compare the price healthy food (fruit) to lets say (a fast food hamburger) fating food you can get way more.Then there is the issue of being fat, I have have not ever seen any cheap fat clothes. Also fat peoples furniture wear faster.Criminal activity, they already do, a first time offender pays less than than a repeat offender.I could go on and on but I hope you get the picture.|`|7ef176ec08c7ea634fd04b5d033608fcaa	Only if they punish the rest of the world for their unhealthy activities: drinking alcohol, eating fast food, having poor posture, taking pills, sleeping around, etc etc etc.<br>  <br>  Don't get self-righteous.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Yes, being below 18 and over 16 you have to fill out the parents information and must have their signatures on the passport application or a statement of parental consent.

In short you will enjoy greater legal protections than the US federal minimum.<br>  <br>  These include a minimum wage, sick pay, holiday pay, working time regulations, job protection, union rights, grievance rights, health and safety minimums and a competent judicial system to maintain them all.<br>  <br>  It could well be that Slovenia has deliberately enacted only the EU minimum laws in order to attract companies- hence you may not have protections you currently enjoy in your state.

I hear the Mahdi is expected to be ushered in by Iran within 3 years.  Maybe Iran doesn't have a nuke yet, but they're working on it.

The US dollar will be worth nothing once he defaults on our bonds.<br>  <br>  Further, we nationalize all the banks, the car industry and all foreign owned businesses and then we let Big Labor organize them.

I believe he will be a one term President, as people will show their disapproval at the polls ala Jimmy Carter...He thinks he is invincible...and his administration is overreaching...The puppet masters will eat him up and spit him out to serve their goals of a Socialist/Marxist state.  He is way over his head and I believe he knows it.  He was pushed to the Presidency by a liberal media that was consumed to righting the wrongs of racism in this country, never thinking that he did not have the experience, no matter.  Also, illegal contributions from all over the world, ACORN, his associations with terrorist Bill Ayers, his radical views and his association with Rev. Wright, were all swept under the carpet under the guise of Change and Hope...But people did not know that Change meant Socialism and a usurping of our constitution and our way of life and instead of hope we are getting hopelessness...So who knows what will happen, all I know that people are disallusioned and his disdain for the Stock Market where the little guy had his 401K money, his life savings, his college fund for his kids, did not go over very well with the Masses (as the Marxists call the people) and I expect his poll numbers to go down...Oh wait, he saved 28 jobs!

meVH73dOaa	We have heard references to Lincoln who I heard is Obama’s favorite president. Obama swore in on Lincoln’s Bible, which was purchased the day of his [Lincoln's] inauguration because he did not have his family Bible. I have heard the comparisons to FDR and given that Obama has spent a trillion dollars to pay off political favors I would say that he is like FDR except he spent a hell of a lot more. I have compared Obama to Carter because he is doing some of the things Carter did that hurt us for a long time. But I think Obama has demonstrated that he is more like Richard Nixon right about now.<br>  <br>  Obama is following in Nixon’s footsteps in that he has an enemies list consisting of people in the media. Before some liberal gets his panties in a bunch, it only has to be a list committed to memory, not written down. However, since Obama’s henchmen have been plotting to go after one of these people since the latter part of last year, I think it is safe to say that this is a tactic and not a passing fancy.<br>  <br>  The people on the list, so far, are Jim Cramer, Rick Santelli, and Rush Limbaugh. It would seem that every time a personality on radio or TV has something to say about The Evil One, that person is called out by the petty players in the White House.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh is on the list because the Democrats think they can make a case that he leads the Republican party and that he wants America to suffer financial ruin. None of this is true and the Democrats are taking him out of context. They think they can get the best of him but he can gin up quite a bit of support for a lot of things.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh will make them look like fools when all is said and done. The White House is all bluster and even though nobody messes with Joe and Obama, the metrosexual, talked tough about being ready for a fight nothing could be farther from the truth. Obama plays Chicago politics and would rather have someone cap you in an alley than confront you head on.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh has already fired a response salvo. He challenged Obama to a debate at his studio, on his radio program, at a time convenient for Obama. Rush offered to send his private jet for Obama, send a caravan of SUVs to pick him up, put him up in a 5 star hotel and to have that $100 a pound steak Obama likes flown in. Limbaugh said he would foot the bill for it all so that it cost no taxpayer money (except obviously the routine expenses like Secret Service) if Obama would come to debate him.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh made a good point when he said that if Obama debates and wins he will have the country to himself. Of course, I doubt Obama could debate Limbaugh in the arena of ideas and even come close to winning. This would be especially true since Limbaugh said just you and me. No advisors, no teleprompters, no note cards, no nothing but the two of them.<br>  <br>  There is no way Obama will accept this offer. He knows he has more to lose than to gain. Yes, he would have the country in his hand if he won but if he lost he would be toast. By doing nothing he stays above the fray (well, he does that anyway by having his henchmen do the assaulting) and he does not have to worry.<br>  <br>  I think it was a tactical blunder for the Obama folks to directly attack people in the media, especially Rush Limbaugh. When this is all said and done Limbaugh will have made them look foolish as he has done time and again.<br>  <br>  Anyway, all the talk about who Obama is like is moot now. With his enemies list he is like Nixon.<br>  <br>  Barack Milhous Hussein Obama.<br>  <br>  Wonder if he has the place bugged…|`|gdYN39gtaa	Rush is one patriotic dude.

iBitNRZuaa	I think it is a combination of greed and short-term thinking coupled with inadequate governmental controls/application of those that were already on the books. <br>  <br>  For example,  I am old enough to remember that back in the day, business schools and models placed great emphasis on gathering profits for the company, longetivity, and how one could make their business a three generation, 100 year old company rather than a single generation 20-50 year company.  I am also old enough to remember reading little bits and pieces in the development of the model advocating the creation of companies for the sole purpose of re-sale while the market demand for their product was hot.  I also remember the business anaylists' demand for companies to turn geometrically progressive double digit profits on a quarterly basis.  Business leaders, and their value, began to be judged upon their own personal wealth.  Labor became a curse word as an unbearable cost and as a way of life to the point that even low and middle income folks sought to hire out traditional yard maintenance and house keeping labor chores.  Business leaders responded by stripping off company profits, assets and longetivity prospects, and labor's improvements into their personal portfolios.  The concerns of becoming an economy with few if any source products, either manufactured or raw goods, were present in the early 1980's; one theory is that after a while, all an economy has to offer is cheap labor for use by other economies.<br>  <br>  Socially, we began to impress upon ourselves to make choices that involved personal responsibility towards our own financial health at a time that we either reduced govenmental oversight, When legislated requirements were instituted, we allowed them to be under funded to the point of being non-existant.  "We" were pleased withour selves because in the process we were reducing government, government interferance with the conduction of business, and reducing our taxes in the process.  Instead, we increasingly relied on the moral compass of business and business partnerships.  Some how in the process, we came to believe that we all could reap sustained, unbelievable profits while reducing our materials and labor.  <br>  <br>  On the individual home front, houses got huge with little more usable floor space.  In part as fewer houses were being built for a variety of reasons, the profit on a single $500,000 house was larger and took less cost than to earn profit on five $100,000 houses.  But also, because the "standard" house simply became more and larger.  The same is true for all things related to clothing our selves and our houses.  I like to pick on shoes:  In the 1980's or so, Imedia Marcos fled the Phillapeans with some 200 pairs of shoes.  Much of the world, including the US press, were agast at the number of shoes she owned.  Pre-current economic times, it was not uncommon for many of us to own 20-50 pairs of shoes; it was not unheard of for simple, middle income folks to own more than 100 pairs.  Further, we believed that we "needed" this number as it was "expected" for us to have a pair of shoes, or more, for each wardrobe combination.  For this to occurr, we needed to increase our shoe budgets, (sometimes beyond our means, but often beyond what would elsewise be economically prudent), be willing to accept cheaper quality for afordability, and seek cheaper production costs at the expense of other considerations.  On the home front, we have adopted the 5 year plan with respect to home furnishings, remodels, and complete re-landscaping of yards.  Yes, in reading some real estate magazine about 2 years ago, a kitchen is considered in need of updating for re-sale if it has not been remodeled within the previous 5 years; the same was true of bathrooms, molding, and other interior decor features, and the exterior landscape design complete with vegetation and hardscapes.  One realator wouldn't even consider taking on a house for selling unless it had such updates; this was when houses were selling and before our current housing woes.  Just two years ago, I watched a national news article in which is was suggested that it was negligent for a parent to not equip their kindergardeners with cell phones so that they could be in contact with their parents as needed, in an emergency, or for rough days at school when they felt the need to talk with their parent.   <br>  <br>  As consumers, we've accepted these expectations.  As laborers, including those once safe white-collar jobs, we accepted these expectations of reduced materials, reduced labor, and increased top-level profits.  In turn, we expect the sellers of the good and services we purchase to follow the same principles.  As citizens, we endorse smaller government and fewer taxes while expecting the same levels of service of the types we rely on; we're a little less particular about those that others rely on and/or those we're unaware of.  (Take the broom closet lab of the folks who test toys and the|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Government for no oversight of big businesses.  Big businesses for greediness.|`|AA11357056	There's probably enough blame for everybody, but for the most part it's due to us becoming a consumer economy instead of a manufacturing economy. I saw a TV program that said in the 1960s, we had 6% of the world's population but produced 50% of the world's goods. Now we're probably lucky if it's 10%. Think about it - how many of the things you buy are actually made here?<br>  <br>  Once the manufacturing base (and jobs) disappeared, the only thing left was consumer and service industries. To keep the spending cycle going, people started living beyond their means with credit cards and home equity loans.<br>  <br>  When that finally dried up, it became a situation of, as Warren Buffett put it "borrowers who shouldn't have borrowed from lenders who shouldn't have lent".<br>  <br>  Now we're stuck in a cycle where government is basically printing money to keep the economy going.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	We are the fault. The buck stops here. I am guilty. You are guilty. And our neighbors are guilty.

Our competition to have has left a lot of have nots falling into pitfall poverty and a one way fate that will only get worse.

1KGXts5Daa	The US is one of the few western, industrialized nations that imposes capital punishment, and not all states have a death penalty (although most do).<br>  <br>  Although it is statistically true that it costs more to execute someone than it does to sentence them to life in prison ("10x more" is debatable, however), cost should not be the predominant argument either for or against the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Chief among reasons to consider banning execution should be the knowledge that innocent people have been executed in the past, and the aversion to making such a horrific mistake in the future.  Within just the past couple of years, dozens of death sentences have been commuted to life terms, and in a number of cases people who have been incarcerated for years (some on death row) have been released from prison and declared by states as completely innocent of the crime which they had been accused of - thanks in large part to DNA testing.<br>  <br>  While study after study has shown that capital punishment does little or nothing to reduce crime, many people (at least here in California) still favor having the death sentence for either ideological reasons (an "eye for an eye" - ironically, a practice in countries which many of those same people who use the quote would prefer to see obliterated), philosophical reasons (viewed as appropriate punishment for serial or sadistic criminal behavior), or "therapeutic" reasons (a sense of having received ultimate justice, vengeance, or the knowledge that the perpetrator is incapable of being released to possibly re-victimize).<br>  <br>  The use of capital punishment tends to ebb and flow, not based on economics, but rather, on an overall consensus of the citizenry.  In California, capital punishment was discontinued for a period of 25 years (from the 1970's to the 1990's) after having been ruled cruel and unusual punishment by the California Supreme Court in 1972.<br>  <br>  Even though voters passed a proposition later that same year re-authorizing capital punishment (but with stricter limitations for implementation) the practice was not carried out for another 2 decades due to various ethical, political and moral reasons - which accounts, in very large part, for the reason Charles Manson is still alive and behind bars rather than having been executed, as ordered by the court in 1971.  (<a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonchrono.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects...</a><br>  <br>  Even opponents of capital punishment find it hard - after studying the facts and circumstances of the Charles Manson murders - to justify anything other than execution in that particular case.<br>  <br>  It would be interesting to find, of those who favor quick execution of the condemned, what their feelings would be if they found themselves in the position of having been convicted of a death penalty crime (if falsely convicted or otherwise) and how many appeals they thought they should be allowed.<br>  <br>  According to the California Dept. of Corrections, "The average cost to house an inmate is about $33, 581 per year. Staff assigned to the execution team receives their regular, budgeted salaries. The cost of the execution procedure, including the chemicals utilized, is minimal."<br>  <br>  "The real cost involved in the capital punishment procedure is related to the court reviews, both those mandated by the Legislature as well as the appeal procedures initiated by the convicted inmates’ legal staff. These costs vary depending upon the resources of the convicted inmate and the length of the court procedures involved."  (<a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/historyCapital.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/...</a>|`|AA11130699	It does cost a lot more to impose the death penalty than to keep someone in prison for the rest of their life. But an even better reason for abolishing the death penalty is that the innocent may be executed, and there probably have been. The innocence project has helped to exonerate over 200 people since it began and a good portion of them were death row inmates. With that many people exonerated in the short time the innocence project has been around I will never believe that innocent persons have not been executed in the past. I believe it was Chief Justice Frankfurter way back that said, "I would rather 10 guilty people be set free than to have one innocent person executed." That's the reason the death penalty should be abolished.|`|AA11729751	That is only because we choose to make death sentences expensive.|`|i790R5DXaa	Why don't we ask the victims family?<br>  <br>  A:~)|`|UgFntgI9aa	They cost more because there is more than a little popular mistrust of the government's ability to tell who is guilty or not.  <br>  <br>  And therefore there is much support for the considerable rights of due process we are all heir to, as laid out in the Bill of Rights and legal precedent. <br>  <br>  In recent years, with the development of DNA evidence, a large number of persons have been found, after the fact, to be completely innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted in a court of law.  Some of them on death row. <br>  <br>  These are innocent people who, before the development of this new technology, would have certainly served the sentences handed out to them, including the death penalty.  <br>  <br>  This sort of thing doesn't inspire the additional trust in the governments abilities, as would be required for "1 appeal then flip the switch."<br>  <br>  In fact, I would venture to guess that many of the "hardest liners" on this subject would be very, very grateful indeed, to have posted every appeal possible, in the event they (or perhaps someone they cared about) were wrongly condemned to death. <br>  <br>  I'd be very surprised if such a thing hasn't already happened, more than once.|`|RWNd0T8Uaa	It's the appellate process, which can leave one on death row for years and years and years. We were just discussing this and I say death row should be, Death walk: Walk to the chair and sit down!!|`|LyVjJ0ylaa	One bullet doesn' t cost much.<br>  <br>  It's the stupid liberal, "They are people, they have rights....oh pity them they got abused as children" CRAP that causes so many problems with the costs of execution.  WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  Appeals and making sure we don't abuse their "civil rights"....and BS surveys that tell you what they want you to hear.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure of recent costs, but the last figure I heard was approximately $40,000 a year to keep a prisoner on death row.  If a 21 year old gets sentenced to life without parole and because of a really good health plan and dental and better diet than a lot of senior citizens they could live to 70 years old or older.  but lets say 50 years on death row.  Without increases in cost that's $2,000,000.  And you want to tell me that the injections and a medical persons time for an execution is costing over $2 million?<br>  <br>  More liberal crap designed to delude people into thinking that they are right about everything and have the answers for every question.<br>  <br>  Conrad's Heart of Darkness said it best.  "Exterminate the brutes."|`|mkEGjlmNaa	They cost more because bleeding heart liberals delay the execution with years of court filings and appeals that waste money.<br>  <br>  Simple answer:<br>  <br>  1. appeal and then flip the switch

Some libs are disallusioned as they never thought our country would be brought to Socialism so quickly..and the celebs in Hollywood are now worried that their millions will be taxed by the Annointed One.  But, we have a way to go yet.  His poll numbers will diminish slowly, there will be a slight recovery, but then high inflation, gas lines, food shortages, riots in the streets and marches on Washington, and then he will hide in the White House and you will have an invisible President.  All he will have will be his Wed. night parties with $100 a lb. steak and the conga line...Yea, he cares about us...It is such a disgrace what is happening to this country that I can't even conceive where it is going.  If you want to read a good book:  Read:  "It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis written in 1935.  You can get it on line on abebooks.com.  It is the story of a right wing takeover of our country, but if you just change the word right wing to left wing, what happened in this book is so relevent that it scared me out of my wits...Read it and educate yourself.

Bush's negligent tax cuts and de-regulation allowed a bubble to form then burst.<br>  <br>  The dow dropped from 14+ to 8 under Bush, from 8 to 7ish under Obama.  We may not have hit bottom quite yet, but there's a lot less volatility with Obama in office and laying out a consistent strategy for recovery.  There are some jitters in the banks out of fear that they might be briefly nationalized or broken up - that would drive down bank stocks, but stabilize everyone else.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No, not yet.  The DOW is responding to high levels of unemployment, job losses and the knowledge that greed and lack of regulation allowed the banking sector to self destruct.  None of the Obama stimulus would be necessary if the neocon fools had done their jobs.  But wait, they did their jobs.  They wanted rules that facilitated the theft of America's money by the rich - and they were successful.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	no, of course not!!|`|B79lX9Inaa	What is killing the dow is all that corruption and the leveraging, the blind eye to the economy and telling Polson to continue with the Republican Ideology even though they knew that the "economy was NOT fundamentally sound".<br>  <br>  The hedge funds and derivatives also there are a lot of republicans pulling out money trying to posture.  <br>  <br>  You know if republicans paid as much attention to our country & economy instead of tactics in trying to make the democratic party look bad, we wouldn't be in HALF the mess we are in now.<br>  <br>  Surely they didn't care about America, only their corruption, power and greed.|`|BsyC4gevaa	It's not Obama's policy, it is however the globalization and expanded partnership into a global market that has redistributed the wealth and opportunity amongst our neighbors.

He COULD be quiet, but he's getting the effect that his administration wants:  fear.  Without the fear of an ever-increasing downward spiral, they couldn't continue to pass trillion dollar "stimulus" and half trillion dollar "spending" bills with little or no opposition.

For instance, a "question" that isn't a real question or an "answer" that doesn't answer the question; anything that could be construed as rant, chat, or insult; etc.  When dealing with controversial issues, it's a good idea to be scrupulous about this.  <br>  So, I'm not sure about whether there is a bias on the part of YA.

NL3mcSd8aa	Jimmy Carter did some tinkering with the banks back in his day. It depends on what your ideology is, but he deregulated while regulating at the same time.<br>  <br>  He REGULATED the banks in that with the Community Reinvestment Act they were forced to give loans to lower income people and some people (like married women wanting to get a mortgage who had the money but were discriminated against, which was the good part of the bill) who had previously been denied. Like I said, there was good and bad that came from this.<br>  <br>  Then in the 90's when Clinton was in office (and this man deregulated like mad) he wanted more low-income families to have access to mortgages (even though they couldn't afford it) so he and Congress changed the laws to have the government guarantee the bad loans so the banks wouldn't be stuck with the bad debt, which gave the banks a lot of incentive to make loans to people who couldn't afford it. <br>  <br>  And you're correct about the Republicans trying to re-regulate Fannie and Freddie, and the main opposers to that bill were Democrats such as Dodd, Obama, Hillary Clinton, Frank, etc. Chris Dodd, I believe, was the largest recipient of Fannie and Freddie campaign contributions. <br>  <br>  Take from that what you will.|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	We can thank Clintoon and little boys Barney Frank for the mess Yet the lib vocabulary only consist of "blame Bush" and hate Rush instead of stepping up to the plate and taking full responsibility for their failed actions|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Shhhh!<br>  <br>  If you confuse the liberals with verifiable facts they will self destruct, when they attempt to cogitate. <br>  <br>  Oh wait, that may be a good thing......,.carry on.<br>  <br>  Nobama 2012|`|AA12070828	It was not Bush it was freaking Clinton.

Bu4XeFVPaa	I only wish that his mother had exercised that option when she was a pregnant unmarried teenager.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	They tell people what they want to hear and sugar coat things. I don't know how they can force a person, just by virtue of their career, to go against their personal religious and ethical beliefs. Will they also force doctors to perform other elective medical procedures that they feel cause harm? Euthanasia comes to mind....or implanting of too many embryos. If doctor's are forced to perform medical and surgical procedures they feel are unethical or immoral the fallout could be bigger and uglier than anyone imagines. <br>  <br>  A doctor who believes that an unborn child has a right to life, cannot be forced by the government to kill that child. What are we communists? They have forced abortions in China. Except there women are forced to have abortions, but it's the same thing. The government attempting to control people. Sick.<br>  <br>  Catholic hospitals will shut down, they will have to. Currently Catholic hospitals treat 1 in 5 persons in America. That's quite a bit for a privately funded hospital system.|`|39KUKALFaa	He does not think ahead.  Indeed, I think that he might be a moron.  Why?

He wants people to invest, but next day he tells them he will tax them more.  <br>  <br>  You may say that he just does not accept the case that a tax influences behavior.  But then why is he proposing cap and trade to reduce energy consumption?  It is by imposing a massive tax.<br>  <br>  The American people should listen to the butcher, not the butcher's block.

He is the most pro-abortion president ever, and the farthest to the left since FDR. He doesn't care about the suffering of the American people due to his far left policies. What a disgrace!<br>  <br>  I am hoping that the Catholic Church will start ex-communicating American politicians who support FOCA.<br>  <br>  The Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) would eliminate every restriction on abortion nationwide.<br>      * FOCA will do away with state laws on parental involvement, on partial birth abortion, and on all other protections.<br>      * FOCA will compel taxpayer funding of abortions.<br>      * FOCA will force faith-based hospitals and healthcare facilities to perform abortions.<br>  <br>  FOCA would establish the right to abortion as a fundamental right (like the right to free speech) and wipe away every restriction on abortion nationwide. It will eradicate state and federal abortion laws that the majority of Americans support and prevent states from enacting similar protective measures in the future.

He feels that abortions should be completely open and free to anyone, without restriction of any kind (yet, he campaigned to reduce the number of abortions in America.  Contradiction?), from state laws, to parents, to medical doctors.  By his thinking, there wouldn't be any impending problem with the medical community if those doctors would just quit being stupid and look at things the right way (the Obama way).<br>  <br>  I have a friend who just graduated from medical school.  If Obama forces doctors to perform abortions despite their moral convictions, where does that leave my friend?  He just spent some 8 to 10 years in school and spent a ton of money for his education.  Is that now all for nothing?  What will Obama's law do to his medical license?<br>  <br>  Also, what about the upcoming crop of doctors and nurses either graduating from medical school or thinking about starting?  If they are pro-life, Obama's law leaves them with no chance of entering that profession.  Will this cause a shortage of medical personnel?<br>  <br>  Obama needs to think long and hard about what he's doing, and he needs a conversion of the heart.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	They can't force them. To people of faith, their religion governs the way in which they live their lives; it is a higher authority than the state. Doctors who refused to perform abortions before will still refuse. And there will be hell to pay if anyone tries to force them. It's so stupid. Like any other medical procedure, abortion has risks. If I were to have an abortion, the LAST person I would want doing it was someone who didn't want to do it. <br>  <br>  Obama's mama punished the entire country with HER baby.<br>  <br>  Improper Bostonian, if you're pro-choice, it's certainly not because of your Catholicism. The Church's position on abortion is quite clear - it's the intentional killing of a separately-conceived human life. But will you ever be in the position of having to perform an abortion yourself? I THINK that's what the question was about.|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Hussein's agenda does not include what is best for America As of right now Obama and his congress are becoming public enemy #1

If you really didn't ever get a ticket before, then my only guess is that there was a mix-up between you and the other owner, who probably actually got the ticket.  This would be a simple clerical error, and one that is fairly common I'm afraid.  That's why it's recommended that you order your driving record, and credit report, once a year to keep an eye on it.

You must have been cited for "driving without insurance" before. It'd be in your DMV records, and you did not "take care of it" (i.e. go to court, pay the ticket, whatever). The only way is go to DMV and pull your own records, and find out which court / jurisdiction gave you the citation, and then go there and resolve it. This will take you at least a full day if not two. <br>  <br>  And obviously, DO NOT DRIVE THERE!<br>  <br>  Driving with a suspended license can be VERY expensive, like $150 or more. <br>  <br>  ---<br>  Kasey C, PC guru since Apple II days<br>  Don't take life too seriously, you won't get out alive.|`|aTLiaEGxaa	This is somewhat confusing.

You should really do some research on these things. Google for the Marines and Air Force offical websites. You should probably talk it over with a guidence consuler at school, and definitly your parents!<br>  Besides I don't think you can just pick what military branch you want to be in if you're a nurse. You just become part of the Red Cross.<br>  It's a really big desicion so please do lots of research and thinking before you jump into anything.<br>  Lots of luck!|`|xFTdSe1Qaa	just go and talk to the recruiter they will help you and give all the advice you need but i would reach out a little bit further like what is you avsb score as of now nurses need a 35 at least but try to reach to diffrent branches as well|`|bC072x57aa	<a href="http://www.marines.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marines.com/</a>|`|wRLCkv4Raa	To each his own.  Even though the Marine Corps and the Air Force are on two different ends of the military spectrum I want to first commend you for your decision to join the service.  Each branch is a little different but in the big picture have just about the same benefits.  Free medical and dental, same pay in every branch according to rank, etc.  You  need to narrow down exactly what you want.<br>  <br>  Each brach has it's own emphasis.  Navy's is water, Air Force's is air, Army's is Land, and Marine Corps's is all three in a glory of untouchable greatness (yes I'm a Jarhead).<br>  <br>  Now, the Marine Corps does not have any medical fields when it comes to jobs you can sign up for.  So if your heart is set on a nurse then you can kiss the Marine Corps goodbye.  We get our medical staff from the Navy (so don't rule them out).<br>  <br>  Being a Marine is the probably the most respected position you can hold when it comes to branch of service.  Of course every branch has their badasses like Navy Seal and Green Berets and all that jazz.  But when it comes to the best training, the closest brotherhood, and the most elite fighting force, it's Marine Corps all the way.  NOTHING can prepare for what you will experience at Marine Corps boot camp.  You can get in shape, you'll still be tired.....you can do everything exactly right at boot camp, and still get yelled at.   I'm not saying don't prepare, because you'll need to.  If you want just email me and I can tell you all about what you'll DO at boot camp.  But the experience is different for everyone and getting ready for it really depends on the type of person you are.<br>  <br>  My final word is to visit every branch's local recruiting office.  They will give you all the information you need.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  I've seen too many people just walk into the first office and sign....look around.
