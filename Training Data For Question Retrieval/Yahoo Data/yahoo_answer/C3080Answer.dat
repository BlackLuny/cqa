DozD8lTGaa	Ok, go onto Yell.com and type in what you are looking for. It will come up with numbers and e-mails of places in that area. Ring them or e-mail and explain to them that you need a work placement but, you want something that gives you best experience and involves a lot of hand on work; rather than cleaning up and basically slaving around for them.<br>  <br>  Or, go to London and have a look around; go in and talk to one of the Staff and even the manager.<br>  <br>  It is easy once you get going. But, definitely go onto www.yell.com and this does help.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope i helped :) X

fR2Geezcaa	I wish her luck as she is standing behind all the displaced auto workers applying for entry level positions just trying to feel their families. It is pretty darn hard to find a job in Michigan right now. I have a college degree and I am now wondering if I will soon be asking people if they would like to super-size their meal.<br>  <br>  I do think for a first job it would be great if it was in something she has an interest in, so it keeps her motivated. Plus it would be nice to start off having a job she can be proud of. If she is in to fashion maybe apply at the mall or if she is in to sports apply at a local baseball field or at a Joe Dumar's type recreation center. Not to many teens want to work at fast food places. It sucks handing food out to your friends while wearing a usually embarrassing uniform.<br>  <br>  FYI - Everyone keeps mentioning a work permit, yes she will need one but she can can get one from her school. Plus since you posted this in Detroit, the Federal/Michigan Child Labor Laws permit 14+ to work they just define how many hours a 14-15 yrs old old can work. They are all so defined hours for 16-17 yrs old too.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to her!|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	A grocery store would be her best bet. <br>  <br>  When I was 15, I got my first job bagging groceries with a local grocery store.|`|uQZQTAAlaa	I would try a local grocery.....however my 15 year old sister works with mentally retarded children and she makes like 200 dollars. She also babysits them and makes a lot of money...however if your daughter were to do this I suggest you attend her at a class to learn how to work and watch mentally retarded children.|`|a19Z5rwLaa	Street corners are a great place to start.|`|WI8qeyJmaa	in Bangladesh.....Nike shoe factory|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	a bagel shop|`|OXohgDoJaa	With the job market as tight as it is right now it's going to be harder for kids to get jobs. Adults are doing anything they can to make a buck so employers are going hire them insted of kids. Have her babysit or something.|`|8GeNdCsIaa	other then babysitting, some grocery stores might hire her, mcdonalds might, or fast food joints. a lot of places unfortuantely dont hire until their 16 .|`|mEs0n9XTaa	Network, it's who you know.<br>  <br>  ? ?

PDotv2Hsaa	Hi Osam3, the best way to do this is to go to Sim Lim Square. Most of the 3rd or 4th storey shops have price lists where the CPU, RAM, graphics card etc are listed. Just choose the ones you want and they can put it together. If you want the shop to assemble everything you want, it'll be about S$30 otherwise you can do it yourself.
ORjH7TD1aa	Publix and Kroger will hire at 15, but make sure she gets a work permit from her high school.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend Publix, if she is thinking about going to college they offer great scholarships and tuition reimbursement.  Also, they typically pay more than Kroger.<br>  <br>  If she is just looking for a summer job try Six Flags, but remember that is all day in the heat.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|33D9CDWwaa	A lot of places hire 15 year olds.  but what they can do is pretty limited.  Be sure, before school gets out, that you get a work permit for her.<br>  <br>  Six Flags hires 15 year olds.
hIqCpiXKaa	Hum. Well the best person to detail your car is obviously you. Its just not a fun job. Anyway, may I suggest taking your car back to the dealer (ie ford, gm...) to have to detailed. They will do the best job. If you want to question their detailing capabilities, I suggest you look at their parking lot. Other then that any place that charges over 60 bucks will do a fantastic job.|`|mDYsr62maa	Maybe. It sounds a lot like the one my dad told me to use when I was a teenager, Get off the Couch Inc.

You can buy clothes...iPods (yes plural), sofas, TVs, Computers, Laptops...loads of stuff (of course only one of it, not all of these things for 500 altogether...lol)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  [x]
ay8tXLD2aa	Well, have a think about it for a minute - did you APPLY for this job?  Did you send them your resume or cv?  Did you have an interview with them? Did you discuss the position with the employers?<br>  <br>  If your answer to those questions is NO, then there is about a 300% chance that the "employment offer" is not real. <br>  <br>  Honestly.
