All of a sudden I saw this little thing moving along the road (pretty busy, and full of BIG trucks) and I was like "what is that? Is that a cat?" so anyway, come to find out it's a TINY LITTLE PUPPY! Of course I pick it up, because I do NOT want it to get run over.. plus it was raining! Who the eff lets a tiny puppy out like that in the rain, there weren't any houses around or anything?? Anyway, I have no idea how old it might be or even it's breed. It's kind of fluffy, has tiny ears and a tiny tail lol. I cannot keep her, I hope to find her owner or find a home for her... but right now we're calling over Olive. I know they aren't the best of pics, if you want me to take more and try again then just let me know.      I am wondering how big do you think she'll get? I tried to get pictures with her feet in them (mostly unsuccessful) cause I know sometimes you can base height/weight off of feet . Thanks for any help here's the pics:       http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...        http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...           http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...        http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...

At first I thought it was coming from the back of my wardrobe but I've cleared this out and there is no evidence of any mice or rats. This morning I was woken by the noise and am sure it's coming from the roof. Do rats and mice live in lofts? How do they get there!!! I'm too scared to go and check it out but what can I do if they are up there? I can't afford to call out pest control, even though my house is a council house they still charge you.

20090222221138AA3zvaK	Pets;Birds	Should I buy my lovebird a mate?	I have a lovebird that constantly keeps picking himself.  I am pretty sure it’s due to loneliness because he only picks when he is left alone for a while.  He wore a cone for as long as 3 months, but I took it off for about a week and he was doing great.  He just recently started picking again and I am really considering getting him another friend.  I know that if I do get one I have to get a separate cage for a while to see if the interact okay.  My question is if it’s a good idea to get one or not and if I do, does it matter if it’s a boy or a girl, I am not too sure how to tell the difference.  Also, my bird is about one year old if that means anything.  Thanks in advance to any and all answers.

I've never seen white pieces or anything in his waste. He only goes outside for walks. I'm planning on taking him to the vet very soon.      What could be wrong with him?

He was the only cat in the house until yesterday when my girlfriend gave me a female kitten as a late valentines day gift. My older cat did not react well and hissed at the new kitten and attacked me. My older cat glares, growls, and hisses at me every time I walk by him.

I don't want to, but my parents have made the decision that we need to put her down before she is in too much pain.       I want to know from other peoples experience what they have found to be the better option. On one hand I really don't want her to be burned, even after being put down.       And on the other hand I don't want her to deteriorate under the ground with insects and etc.. plus i don't think my parents are going to keep this house for more than 2-3 years. And burying her somewhere else is just not an option for me.       I am in a tough spot as I am extremely attached to her and I don't want anything bad for her even after death, if people could provide their insight I would appreciate it.       Any rude comments will be removed and reported and I think anyone that does is a low low person.

I think they are siblings, or at least lifelong companions. They are wonderful friends and inside, gentile and obedient. When we go for walks they are very hostile to other dogs, to the point that when I see a dog coming I have to stop and hold on to them and feed them treats.

20090222230930AAxjONJ	Pets;Fish	Has anybody ever had this happen?	I bought a girl molly and two girl guppys all of which were VERY pregnant three days ago.  I read how they can live in saltwater if you add the salt slow enough and was going to try this myself.  I haven't put any salt in the tank yet, but both guppys died.  =[        But one guppy had her babies two days ago before she died.  I saw six in the tank and all six are still alive today.  Why didn't the molly eat them? I always thought fish ate their babies?  There's a cave and one plant the molly can get completely around and no gravel, so there's no place they can hide.  Any ideas?  Is this odd?

20090222232202AAfZKQB	Pets;Dogs	Help with my Pit/Mastiff Mix?	HELP!!?!, I just adopted a pit/Mastiff Mix. I'm fimalar with pit's, Anyone have any tips or experience with Mastiff's? every since I've gotten him (he is a very large dog) He has been pooping in my daughter's room. I just cleaned it up and vacuumed, I shoo'd him out a few times, and he slipped by me, first thing he did was poop! He spends 80% of his day outside. The previous owner's say he refuse's to go into a crate, he hates small place's. they adopted him from a homeless guy and they had him in a one bed room apartment for 7 months, He just turned a year, he knows Basic commands. I've been working on him jumping up, He still likes to push up against and knock down my 2 year old. I think he is trying to show dominance, he never growls or snaps at her though. if he gets to where he can't get to us, or if we go outside for a minute, he will howl and bark and whine. He has tore up carpet and the floor. He goes in my daughter's room and gets her dolls and tears them up. He'll go in her room and get toys out and chew them up. need some advice!! Don't know what to do

My neighbour refuses to get a new fence and dad tried nailing it all up, but it doesn't work.       The other day, we went on a three day holiday and my nana rang up telling us that she had come to her house in the middle of the night so she kept her there. We even have another dog to keep her company. I am scared that she'll get run over one day so I need to know how to stop her. She gets scared very easily and she loves my nana, so she always goes there (even thogh it's like a 15 minute walk...)

She has got dry yet greasy, crusty, itchy elephant skin and a horrible odor.  Medications did not work except for one antibiotic she was on but it came back once the medication was gone.  She has lost half her hair and lost weight because her body is trying too hard to fight it.        Has anyone at all had a dog like this and have you found anything that works?  I know the condition is chronic with her but if I can keep the yeast at bay with treatment, I think we will all be happier.

20070522200824AAeuzWz	Pets;Dogs	What is the best way to keep a dog happy?	We prefer to keep our dogs outside during the summer, in a kennel, but they cry and howl especially our new dog.  They are beagle mixes.  They like to be in the house, but I have allergies and they get into things also.  Would an invisible fence keep them happier so they can at least run?  We tried a shock collar on the new dog and now he just has an annoying sqeal but the barking is gone.  We cannot possibly walk the dogs enough to keep them happy.

20070626163854AAP8tzn	Pets;Dogs	Is this situation good for a Siberian husky?	Ok, I have been wanting a Husky for a long time now. I want to make sure the dog will be happy. I live in north Georgia, so the summers get hot. But the rest of the year is pretty nice in my opinion. I do a lot of hiking and camping and walking, so I think the dog would get plenty of exercise.  But whats concerning me is the weather. Will a Siberian Husky do ok in a Georgian summer?  Between that and making sure all these conditions will fit for the dog, and it will be happy. We own 12 acres, and I'm only gone 2 days out of the week. I spend most every afternoon outside. I want a companion that will stick by my side as I camp, hike, and walk and everything else I might do. My question is, Will this dog be happy in these conditions? Weather? Good Exercise? and socialization? Any Tips would be greatly appreashated also.
20070626164727AAGtTIi	Pets;Other - Pets	Have a scarred my puppy for life?	I bought my new puppy Saturday, the day she turned 8 weeks old, and according to "The Art of Raising a Puppy" by the Monks of New Skete, the first day of her "fearful period".  She is a white german shepherd with what appears to be a sometimes shy personality.  She isn't too scared to let my husband or I pet her, but she refuses to come out of either our bedroom or the guest bedroom.  She only feels comfortable playing in the house while she is in one of those rooms, otherwise she will walk very slowly and be unresponsive to her name being called, toys, or playful behavior.  We have two cats who are 1 year old and 8 months old, and bringing the puppy into the house hurt their feelings.  Although they never hit her and the puppy is completely still and calm around them, they USED to hiss whenever they accidentally found their selves in contact with her... usually around the corner of a bedroom doorway.  I'm worried this experience has somehow damaged my puppy forever.  What can I do?

20090203132257AACdKSu	Pets;Dogs	Does this diagnosis sound correct? Kennel cough?	So my 8 month old, Old English Bulldog would reverse sneeze every once in a while, which I realized wasnt a huge deal. But about 10 days ago, she started reverse sneezing everyday 4-5 times a day. She also would gag a little in the middle of playing/running around, sorta a gag/clearing of throat/cough. But not a constant cough remotely. So i brought her to the vet and the vet said her tonsils/throat area was inflamed and my puppy actually coughed a little (cuz she was pulling on her leash to see all the people) and was sorta gagging/wheezing. (which doesnt happen when she pulls on the leash normally). So after checking her lungs, heartbeat, etc. I was given medicine for 10days for Kennel Cough. She does cough a little and has a bit of a runny nose, but it doesnt seem to be anything close to what I have read about kennel cough...green mucus, constant honking dry coughing. So she is on the meds, etc. But does this seem like a correct diagnosis. I didnt think reverse sneezing was a symptom of kennel cough? just a coincidence? Also, how long  before my puppy isnt contagious and when can I expect the cough to go away? thanks!
