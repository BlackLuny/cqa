SO THEY JUST PLAY "FOLLOW THE LEADER" even when their LEADER is leading them to a latrine full of crap     THE UN NEVER AGREED TO THIS WAR|`|AA10592411	Yes we believed this. At the time we were gathering intelligence from spys all over the world from different countries. Colin Powell even testified that we had proof. And now he is (kind-of) against the whole deal.    Listen, a lot of the stuff has media influence. You need to use your brains and sort out the liars and real people that actually look out for us.     For a time there, we (US) actually thought Iraq had the capabilities to launch a nuke weapon or detonate one as we liberated Baghdad.     This is it. The main reason why this all happened is because Iraq violated something like 12 instructions to allow UN inspectors and disable atomic capabilities.    This isnt rocket science. The WORLD voted to stop what they were doing and Saddam refused. Now the same thing is going on in Iraq and North Korea.    Bush is not the problem at all. If you look at the situation he has actually nothing to do with what happened, He was acting on the WORLD.     Unfortunately, the media has ruined everything and makes US presidents look like idiots. :(|`|1a56131c3abf24d4d8d47eb071dde210aa	No, the Administration was well aware that their accusations would not hold up in the long run.    Especially any of the reports of a nuclear program in Iraq.    They also knew, however that once we were there, that our presence would make it inherently unstable. They left the borders open to allow the jihadists and Al Qaeda to enter.    They dissolved ALL political and social structure in the country, which ensured a high unemployment rate, and the inability to provide essential services.    This provided a pool of recruit-able angry men.    They provided someone in Iraq with a large number of weapons without recording the serial numbers, or documenting who received the arms.     Armed the insurgency    They gave away 9 Billion, yes B I L L I O N, dollars in cash to someone in Iraq. They have no idea who got it and it appears to be untraceable to date.    Funded Al Qaeda and the insurgency      As far as the nuclear question, I do not believe that our current President would hesitate to use nuclear weapons. If Saddam had possessed or deployed such a device, the nuclear counter would have been immediate and overwhelming.    We have more and bigger nukes than all other countries in the world combined.    We are the only country or entity in the history of the world to deploy such weapons, and we did so on two heavily populated civilian targets.    Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, mutually assured destruction no longer applies.     If we use first strike, only a handful of countries could retaliate. They would have to consider carefully, because we can wipe any country in the world without putting a dent in our nuclear arsenal.    This puts the US in a position of ultimate power in the world.     This is the basis for the neo-con plan of world domination by the US. Tactical use of nuclear weapons sure would send a powerful message to all the little kids.    Instead of using this obvious advantage as a backdrop for efforts in a positive direction or government is acting like a bully in a schoolyard.    If we say it - it is true by default. If proved wrong later, deny prior knowledge of the true facts.

Its pretty clear these days that it was easy, through a little research, to see that Iraq did not have wmd's. The program that Iraq did have to develop wmd's was destroyed during the Clinton administration. This is a FACT. Since then they have been incapable of making these types of weapons.    The Bush administration told the country that Iraq had wmd's in order to bolster support for the war that he wanted to start a long long time ago. IRAQ was the MAIN goal of the current administration BEFORE he was elected. Through making up connections between 9/11 and Iraq and then saying that Iraq posed a huge danger to the American public with wmd's he scared the vast majority of us into letting him start a war that, looking back at it now, was almost completely unjustified.    As time goes on and as more of the truth comes out we the public will see that this war has done almost nothing good besides ousting Saddam. Bush is a BUISINESS man. His goal is to make MONEY, not make people happy. He and his administration lied to US and I hope that people can one day see and understand this horrible truth.|`|AA10477769	Funny how easy you all blame Bush. He's the bad guy he is so dumb he "lied" us into war. You call him dumb but yet he was smart enough to dupe most of congress into VOTING to take Saddam out.  Well then how DUMB does that make them??? And please the U.N.? If you ever took time to read up on them you would see what a joke it is. There are many theories on what happened to the WMD's. Some have actually been found. But hardly gets reported.  None of the good things and the success our solders are having gets reported. Only when they do something wrong or are accuesed of doing something wrong then it's front page news baby!  And the dialy body count never gets left out.It's up to 3000 or so now. 300 to 600 thousand American solders dies in WW2 in less time! Wonder how you would have treated the president of that time now?  Don't get me wrong I hate war and any casulties are too many. But the way you people think now adays scares me. We are not at war because we are bad for being a super power but some try and make you think it's all our fault because we have more then the poor terrorists. How dare we be a super power it's just not fair! the politically correct thinking that we caused this and deserve everything we get is wrapped.  None of you ever mention the way the terrorists kill some of our brave men and women. Like beating them almost to death then cutting their private parts off and stuffing them in their mouths before they behead them. How dare you say our president and our military are wrong for fighting for your saftey and freedoms. Life is never fair and there will always be those who would dominate others and kill the ones they cannot dominate. And hopefully there will always be an America to fight them back to perserve what is good while we live here on this rock. Sorry but I just get tired of all this sissy mamby pamby crap. Have a good day

Not one of them was from Iraq.  Bush's response to 9-11 was to attack Iraq.  They were not a threat to us.  The war in Iraq has weakened our efforts to fight the war on terror.  Therefore it appears it is Bush who is strengthening the terrorists.  Did you know that there have been more terrorist attacks in the first 2 months of 2007 than in all of 2003, 2004, and 2005 combined?

P.S. "The *either-or fallacy* (often called the false dilemma or false alternative fallacy) unreasonably limits the choices available, usually to two diametrically opposed options. For example, a popular slogan in the 1960s was 'America: love it or leave it.' Put less succinctly, this meant that you must either accept all U.S. policies or emigrate. You might break this argument down as follows:    Major premises: Loyal Americans do not challenge governmental policies. Only loyal Americans deserve to remain in the United States.  Minor premise: These protestors are not loyal Americans.  Conclusion: These protestors do not deserve to live in the United States.    By putting the argument into its deductive form, we can see that the first premise unreasonably limits the definition of 'loyal.' Most Americans - liberal and conservative alike - would probably agree that citizens have a right and a duty to challenge policies they disagree with. The definition of 'loyal' in the first major premise unreasonably excludes other ways of being loyal. Thus, the admonition 'love it or leave it' is revealed as a false choice. You should become automatically suspicious whenever someone proposes an either-or choice. Nearly every situation allows other alternatives."    - _The Seagull Reader_, college freshman English textbook, editor Joseph Kelly|`|AA11791519	Whoever we are fighting--and I don't think that anyone knows with any certainty who that might be--wouldn't belong to any "party"; they hate the West and our whole way of thinking and being....|`|c540847960041cd0939d36acb73fe543aa	You sound like a barker at a carnival trying to get people to come into the tent for the side show.

That  is why we are now dealing with North Korea and the Taiwan/China issue today (China's general saying he will nuke the USA if we intervene  on Taiwan's behalf I take as a declaration of hostile intent). Then you have Carter, who gave away the Panama Canal to whoever bids highest  (China), allowed the nutjobs to takeover in Iran, ignored North Korea launching a nuke program, siding with former nazis, taking a generally anti-Isreal and anti-semitic stance, failing to use the military to resolve the Iran crisis, panicked and lead to a disasterous air collision, lied to us about Three Mile Island, did nothing but block alternative energy projects and acted surprised when high fuel costs lead to runaway inflation, killed a highly trained assasin rabbit with a canoe paddle, and now has the gall to say Isreal needs to give up more land for peace, when every inch they surrendered now is openly being used for attacking or training to attack Isreal. And then there is Ted Kennedy, with classified security access double dealing with the Soviets. We lost in Vietnam because the politicians would not let us do the job that had to be done. Reagan won the freedom of Eastern Europe by having the resolve to look the Soviets in the eye while the people rose up and took their countries back. people like Ted Kennedy and Sandy Berger were crying it would never work, it would lead to war, we would lose, wah wah wah.

But, you will have to probably sue her or threaten to sue her. An attorney can send her a "demand letter" (which demands payment/replacement and threatens to sue if she doesn't comply).    You will have to establish (via receipts, b/f's testimony, etc) that it was your camera and that you didn't give it to her.  Just leaving something at your friend's house it not abandoning it.    You could also pursue small claims court w/o an attorney.  You would still have to prove the same things, but you wouldn't have to pay an attorney.  BUT, the legal system is rarely so easy to navigate - so be prepared.  You file the suit, then serve her with it. Then, you argue in court; or she doesn't show up and court awards you a default judgment.  A court order will force her to pay or replace.  Good luck.  --Z--|`|gvH96Agpaa	It will cost you more to take her to small claims court than buying a new camera.|`|suSpUXH6aa	you may have lost your camera,but if you kick her *** you'll feel better|`|fYyMh3rxaa	An argument can be made that she has to replace the camera because it was admittedly in her care and custody.  Depending on the value of the camera, this may not be worth the expense and time off of work to pursue in small claims court.  You can always file and see if that pushes her into action to replace the camera.    I'm surprised that people can "stop being friends" in such a short span of time!  It seems as if your relationship was pretty superficial.  Maybe it's a guy thing, but she sounds like an acquaintance you hung out with rather than a "friend".     - Carl
2f63fc06faed71659759228922cb4c5faa	A bench warrant is usually issued for failing to appear for a court hearing.   A warrant is forever until it is served or quashed. I've seen people come back with 20 year old warrants that were still valid.   If you know where it was issued you should be able to contact the court clerks office in the county it was issued.   You can normally appear before the judge that issued it to get it set aside as long as you make a prior arrangement with the clerk.|`|cd1a810788f68a9dedf97e107dd8708caa	There coming 2 get you.The judge ordered it. call the circuit court they will tell you.|`|70807a079e463bc4f458aaa92357fea1aa	Bench warrants are issued from courts usually.

Typically, judges issue bench warrants for persons deemed to be in contempt of court  possibly as a result of that person's failure to appear at the appointed time and date for a mandated court appearance. Bench warrants are issued in either criminal or civil court proceedings.    Commonly (but not always), the person who is subject to a bench warrant has intentionally avoided a court appearance to escape the perceived consequences of being found guilty of a crime. If a person was on bail awaiting criminal trial when the non-appearance took place, the court usually forfeits bail and sets a new (usually higher) bail amount to be paid when the subject is re-arrested. If a person is found to have a bench warrant against them when stopped by a law enforcement officer, the person is immediately taken into custody by authorities, rejailed and a hearing is held at which time new bail amount and conditions are set and a new court appearance date is scheduled. Often, if a person is arrested on a bench warrant, that person is held without bail until they can appear in court for whatever incident it was that they failed to appear to address originally. Such a person is referred to as a "flight risk", meaning that there is a high likelihood that they will flee and not appear for their court date (for a second time).    Bench warrants are traditionally issued by sitting judges or magistrates.
dKZveEVMaa	Right now,at this time in our history,is the moment for new parties to come into being.  I fully expect the GOP to split within the next few years.  And can only hope that the Democrats  do the same.    I really think the extremists on both sides are fast becoming too heavy a burden for either party to bear.

xAXV3vX1aa	Something to the effect of..."We deeply sympathize with the plaintiff's problems your honor, but the fact is, she's suing the wrong person. The one who is liable for her injury is the company who manufactures the pinto of oysters, since they were the ones responsible for the contents of their products. In view of this we respectfully request the court to dismiss this case against my client for lack of cause."|`|AA11999780	I would base it on the fact that he could not have POSSIBLY known that there would be a shell in the can. He has never had a problem with the oysters before, so as far as he knew, they were a good brand, just like she asked. The defendent did what she asked, and nothing less. If the plaintiff wants to sue someone, she should be suing the maker of the canned oysters, because they are the ones who mistakenly put the shell in the can, not the defendent. She should have also looked before she chomped. I'm sorry, but the defendent had no responsibility or control over the circumstances of the case. There is no feasible, plausible, or any other synonym for "possible", way that he could have known about the shell, therefore there is no reason for him to pay for the oyster company's mistake.
AA11525464	Yes.  Consider this:  no third party has won a presidential election since 1860.  The Republicans were formed as a third party in 1856 (the other two were the Democrats and the Whigs), and they won the election in 1860, when Abraham Lincoln became President.|`|AA10239858	hell yeah  the 2 major parties has impose restrictions to make it hard a third party from organizing|`|8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	Yes, even though there are several independent parties that are recognized as viable on a state-by-state basis. A party has to gather enough signatures of petitions on a state-by-state basis to qualify for a spot on a state ballot. That takes  much money for advertisements regarding offering different views from the two-party system. Each party has to distinguish itself from the other in order to gain popular support from a fraction of the voters. In political debates (the first one for the Dems is April 26 & for the Repubs on the first week of May) some parties are deemed ineligible to participate because they have to have a certain percentage of support from nationwide polls, usually the Gallup. That's why it's rare to see more than 3 different parties represented on the media. Ross Perot and Ralph Nader were considered the last "threats" to the two-party system in presidential elections. Both tried to take enough support from the parties to force a bargain session on different positions on the issues. Nader had some affect on the election since most of his support came at the expense of the Democrats and John Kerry.|`|fnWB8LePaa	The last third party was the Reform party and it was   short-lived. You need 15% of the general election votes to from a new Government sanctioned Party.

He decided not to do it, then got heat from us, and then changed his mind. He did what he did to try to make Obama look bad. |`|XEG2ZTJjaa	Come on you really believe that McCain was going to solve something, he's not even good with the economy he said it himself. He just wanted a reason to back out because he obviously isn't ready to debate Obama. McCain isn't really good at public speaking anyway so he is going to choke tonight and everyone knows it, I'm surprised your still in denial. |`|69HuMPALaa	Obama is gonna destroy McCain tonight. Nice try honey.|`|bfa2b8a48d1494ec02e8109633f40f51aa	wait...what made him change his mind?|`|6mLj2x8Iaa	Mccain is STILL a fool!  Why?    If you believe in something STICK TO IT!    we dont want a president who caves in or behaves erratically in erratic situations, do we?|`|wTwIdmk9aa	I think that McCain decided he couldn't take the heat from the press, more negative press the worse it wil lbe later and it is still reeling from his choice of VIP. (Miss I can't run the country but can see Russia from my backyard)  Anyway, he has to debate he wouldn't let Obama have the timeslot to himself to answer just one on one...that would be stupid on his part, however he's already shown that he is not fit to lead.  He can't multitask and then so he doesn't see the media he changes his mind, we don't need a president like that.|`|PcW8H1Asaa	Damn tree huggers will believe anything   Sen.Reed says.

Why do so many people think McCain is such a great candidate?  Obama sucks too, but McCain is just as bad.|`|m2LGP1cRaa	No one would leave a campaign this close to an election.  McCain is giving up on this election (probably because now he realizes what a terrible choice Palin was, and she is now a country wide joke).  He made an excuse to leave and go to Washington, where he wasn't needed.  He isn't on the committee and he had nothing to do with the bailout.  People called him out on it, and he HAS to come back for the debate tonight, otherwise he is coping out like originally planned.      There is no angle, it's just what is right in front of everybody's faces.     And seriously, if you are going to sit here and antagonize Democrats: "LMAO I should have know". Duh.  Of course you should have known.  Starting fights like this is not the way to restart this country.  It's yahoos like you arethe type that are flushing this country down the toilet.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	Word is McCain was no help at all in DC.  He caused more chaos than solutions.

And the democrat primary has been this way for quite a while.|`|9c3d57b781184db8448192ff51aafff6aa	Hillary is giving the Republicans a lot of trash to throw at Obama when he wins the nomination. Doesn't matter that most of it isn't true, you can bet the Rep's will pick it up and use it.    That's the way it is with politics, though, in either party. Start with a bunch of candidates who want the nomination. They all spend lots of time and money saying how bad the other ones are. Then when a candidate is finally selected, they all spend a lot of time saying how wonderful the candidate is... the same candidate they were trashing just a few days ago.    Bush said some absolutely horrible things about McCain in the 2000 election. Now Bush is saying what a wonderful guy he is, and what a great President he would make.    Go figure...|`|wLXb06EUaa	The primary is not being dragged on. It is going as it's supposed to.

I really don't think she should have said that considering her own situation. Firstly, she accused Obama of being unAmerican or not seeing America the way we do, which was wrong. But if we look at Palin, many could say she's unChristian, her daughter got pregnant at 16 and she's still unmarried, they may get married next summer and that could change. She tried to have her brother-in-law fired and fired someone else instead. Her backyard is even more dirty than most people's.

The NYT is even backpedeling on it's story yesterday, admitting that there is damning evidence Obama would have had a fair amount of involvement with Ayers.    http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcal...    Once the flood gates open more questions will be raised.    They're close friends. They are associates. Obama's career was launched in Ayer's house! This guy was one of Obama's mentors, taught him the ins and outs of Alinsky style radicalism. Ayers and Obama were partners in various entities and regularly exchanged ideas, including," according to Investor's Business Daily, "how to turn Chicago schools into re-education camps to create a generation of social revolutionaries." That's who Bill Ayers is, and he is unrepentant. And this is who Obama worked with on education.     And who David Axlerod is still in frequent contact with trying to figure out how to spin a long-term relationship with an unrepentent terrorist.

"I say unto you, as your Mother, that any man or woman who performs or takes part of this abomination of the murder of the unborn shall be given a heavy penance upon earth, or if this penance is not given upon earth, that person found guilty in the eyes of his God shall suffer eternal damnation in the fires of hell." - Our Lady, December 28, 1976    HUMAN LIFE IS SACRED  "The Eternal Father command that you stop these murders at once! You will not destroy the lives of the unborn. Human life is sacred in the eyes of your God. No man has the right to destroy a life. The Father, He sends this life to you, and only He will decide when it will return back to the Kingdom.  "Do not, My children, be deceived by the words of the evil ones about you who cry to you of no space left for man. There is space, for My Father has a plan for every life He sends." - Our Lady, August 5, 1971    WILL NEVER BE CONDONED  "You will remember, My children and My child, to guard the young. Your clergy have fallen into darkness. Abortion will never be condoned. But We must have others who fervently will go forward and bring out to the minds of those who have actually seduced the country and the children--bring them the knowledge of Heaven, hell and purgatory. Then they will not have free license to sin." - Our Lady, May 28, 1983    SIXTY MILLION  "I say this for this reason: the Eternal Father is much disturbed at the numbers of abortions being committed throughout your country and the world. These numbers go upwards to fifty to sixty million in one year throughout the world." - Our Lady, June 18, 1986    TREATED AS GARBAGE  "O My child, My tears fall upon you all when I see all of the innocent little babies being slaughtered . . . cast into garbage pails like nothing but dirt and scum. They are living human beings! And all murderers shall get their just recompense." - Our Lady, March 18, 1983    LIMBO  "And what, My children, are We going to do with all the aborted babies? O My child, I know you feel as I do, for I can see the great distress on your face. What are We going to do, My child? Do you understand when they come to Us, they must go to Limbo? They are in Heaven, a happy place, but they cannot see God." - Our Lady, October 2, 1987    SORROWFULLY  "Sorrowfully, the penance that is to come upon the world for the murders of the unborn shall be a chastisement far greater in severity than man has ever witnessed in the past nor ever shall pass through again. Your world is plunging into a deep chasm of suffering and destruction." - Our Lady, May 20, 1978    TORMENT  "The torment that will be visited upon those who murder the innocent shall be eternal damnation and feasting their eyes upon the murdered souls." - Our Lady, May 10, 1972      SACRILEGE  ". . . We cannot tolerate the murders of the unborn. This is a sacrilege of the most foulest manner in the eyes of the Eternal Father, and shall be punishable by death." - Our Lady, May 17, 1986    GREAT PLANS  "The Eternal Father finds that children He had great plans for to bring the true Faith to the world and to save His Son's Church, they have been murdered in the womb." - Jesus, October 1, 1988    WOMAN  "Know, My child, this simple lesson, that in these days of the latter times, women will seek to cast off their role as mother and a woman. Women will cast it off under the direction of satan, and murder her children. Woe to the woman who does not repent of this vile abomination! She has walked the road to eternal damnation and hell. Repent, O woman, or forever be lost!" - Our Lady, March 18, 1975    http://www.tldm.org/directives/directive...

She never got money for the bridge, and if you had researched the Congressional record you would know that to be a fact. I know how scary 'facts' are to you liberals so I'm not surprised.  The study is not to find out how crabs mate, but to find out WHERE they mate and at what times during the year. In case you didn't look this up either, king crab harvesting is a big business in Alaska, and so it's important to understand these things in order to prevent over catching,thus reducing the population to dangerous levels. These kinds of studies are done all over the world and they are supported by environmentalists everywhere. That should make you happy, since most of them are liberals.  I have finally figured out why so many libs hate Sarah Palin, and it's because she is everything you guys aren't. She's smart, accomplished, comfortable in her own skin, attractive, good moral values, strong religious beliefs and she's living proof that a feminist can be a conservative. That must drive you guys crazy !  Now when you have a legitimate question to ask about Governor Palin, and not just more of this everyday hate mongering, you be sure and let us know. Doesn;'t it bother you being so hateful to someone who has never done a single thing against you in her life ? And for the record, she has the highest approval rating of any governor in the Country at 82%, so she is loved by Dems and Repubs alike. That must drive you crazy too !|`|cf55fb70b2bc4bf51b50495757317529aa	The money was diverted to upgrade the ferry system instead of building the bridge.

Zu5hTZSLaa	Scary, isn't it?    Fortunately, a number of states are fighting back and are refusing to go along with the dictate of the Federal Government in respect to the implementation of the Real ID Act.    These states are: Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. Massachusetts has introduced legislation opposing Real ID.    My hat is off to these states which see the Real ID Act for what it truly is... an invasion of our privcy, and a violation of the Jeffersonian principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government.     Hopefully, enough states will say no to Big Brother, and the Real ID Act can be repealed!|`|AA10355356	I agree with Brian B, in that your question has an implied assumption in it.  Certainly it is debatable whether the current administration's policies have overextended the authority of the executive branch.  However, I do not think the state of affairs is at a point remotely comparable to Nazi Germany in the 1930's.  I was in D.C. two months ago and walked past two ladies in front of the White House dressed as pigs while wearing Bush masks and devil horns singing parody songs.  Both privately and publicly funded television media constantly ridicule the sitting administration.  Print media publishes letters-to-the-editor and columns critical of the executive branch, and their political cartoonists blatantly insult public officials (both those freely elected and legally appointed).  I think we're still pretty darned free.    The Real ID act you mentioned (as best I can tell from your only source) simply establishes standards for a legal document that is accepted by federal agencies as proof of one's status.  Since state-issued driver's licenses can be used to gain access to any number of federal benefits (both tangible and intangible) that are paid for by the taxpayers in ALL states, I do not see any problems in requiring the states to conform to some standard on these documents.  Why should someone in Oregon be forced to have their tax dollars support someone who is  not eligible for federal benefits because California decides it wants to be less strict?  These are not excessive standards either.    "Each card must include, at a minimum, the person's full legal name, signature, date of birth, gender, driver's license or identification card number. It also includes a photograph of the person's face and the address of principal residence. It is required to have physical security features designed to prevent tampering, counterfeiting, or duplication of the document for fraudulent purposes."    That sounds like every driver's license I have ever seen.  I don't really see anything atypical about the requirments for issuance of the cards either.    "Before a card can be issued, the applicant must provide the following documentation[7]:        * A photo ID, or a non-photo ID that includes full legal name and birthdate.      * Documentation of birthdate.      * Documentation of legal status and Social Security number      * Documentation showing name and principal residence address.    Digital images of each identity document will be stored in each state DMV database."    The only issue I can understand your concern with regards to the Real ID is the linking of all the state databases.  I admit that I am hesitant to allow any 'official' in any state to know all the information on my state-issued documentation, but I have to go back to the point that these state-issued documents can be used for activities that affect people from all states.  Whether it is simply gaining access to federal benefits one is not eligible for or something more physically dangerous such as gaining access to an airline flight, there are real consequences to ALL Americans that result from any ONE state being lax in standards.  So long as state-issued documents are acceptable for the types of things previously mentioned, I do not see how you get around the need for some uniformity in data standards.|`|ZbcHAoz9aa	WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE US THE FACTUAL INFORMATION ON YOUR STATEMENT?

La diferencia entre monarqua y repblica democrtica estriba en que se es presidente por un periodo de tiempo y es electo por el pueblo (directa o indirectamente).  La primera vez que se utilizo esta forma para designar al ejecutivo fue en los EU. Repblica.

O Brasil seria o dono formal mas a administra??o seria da Onu.. Lderes polticos americanos, franceses e alem?es j se manisfestaram a respeito.  A luta no futuro pelo domnio das reservas de gua doce do mundo vai ser um fato ainda mais complicador, como  o petrleo para os paises produtores, na quest?o da Amaz?nia. A cobi?a dos pases ricos vai se acirrar ainda mais.  Se um dia os pases desenvolvidos resolverem se apossar da Amaz?nia, com o respaldo da Onu, ns n?o poderemos fazer quase nada.  Para voc ter uma idia, basta um porta-avi?es americano com sua escolta de apoio para derrotar as nossas For?as Armadas. N?o estou falando de coragem para o combate, estou falando de capacidade tcnica e de armamentos.  Nossos avi?es e navios seriam destrudos antes mesmo de entrarem em combate tal a diferen?a entre os nossos equipamentos e o deles.  S poderamos tentar resistir, apelando para a luta de guerrilha como fizeram os vietcongs na Guerra do Vietn?, mas precisaramos de muita determina??o e esprito de sacrifcio do povo (tenho as minhas dvidas). para obter algum xito. A maioria do povo brasileiro vive longe da Amaz?nia e n?o teria disposi??o de se sacrificar por ela.  Acredito que s podemos defender a Amaz?nia diplomaticamente, pelas armas  praticamente impossvel.  A Argentina tentou enfrentar um pas desenvolvido de 2a classe, na Guerra das Malvinas e foi derrotada com extrema facilidade, foi como tirar pirulito da boca de crian?a, mesmo com o apoio popular de quase de 100%.

El soldado bolivariano, pueblo venezolano, estaba arrecho, bien arrecho; disperso, confundido, al borde del desespero. Y lleg el lder, comandante, estratega, a decir lo que el pueblo quera escuchar: la verdad, el nimo, el mpetu arrollador, el indomable espritu bolivariano que da vida, luz y esperanza a la Revolucin Bolivariana.    El pueblo venezolano colm las avenidas Urdaneta y Sucre, acapar los espacios radioelctricos y colaps el trfico de la Internet para escuchar al lder, al comandante, al estratega, decir la palabra de Dios; rememorar la Batalla de Santa Ins; y deleitarnos con Florentino y el Diablo.    El pueblo senta una transformacin espiritual y racional como sucede solo una vez cada siglo.    El presidente supo transformar toda esa frustracin y arrechera en motivos para luchar, para vivir, para triunfar. no joda!!!!!    No mas comandos, no mas intermediarios entre pueblo y comandante. El presidente a la cabeza de una campa?a electoral que le retumbar en la cueva al enemigo, que destruir la campa?a meditica, que enaltecer de una vez y para siempre el destino de Venezuela y la Amrica toda.    El enemigo, enclaustrado en un hotel cinco estrellas, comenz a vacilar. Su whiskey 18 a?os se torn amargo. Una rara atmsfera de inminente fracaso inund las salas del hotel y en las solitarias urbanizaciones del Este de Caracas, una corneta por aqu, una cacerola mas all... mas nada.

AA11649253	I think she was talking about her career|`|AA10758051	it means something is out of control and will have a terrible ending|`|ihhH7ck5aa	umm ok what exactly are you talking about here?|`|wCdILHl6aa	Absolutely not. I love Sarah, and her career is still in full-swing. She's had two movies out very recently (within the past few months), has done some press on T.V. for her movies, been in numerous magazines, and ads, was present at the much anticipated Buffy Reunion at Paley Fest 2008 just a couple of weeks ago in L.A., AND has a new movie set to release in the coming months as well. Sarah's career is doing fine and she is in no way a "runaway train."

No one is more professional than I  I am a Non-Commissioned Officer  Leader of Soldiers  As a Non-Commissioned Officer I realize I am a memeber of a time honored Corps, known as the "Back Bone of the Army"  I will not forget, nor will I allow my comrades to forget that we are professionals, Noncommissioned Officers, Leaders! HOOAH!!!|`|etZCR6EAaa	Your neighbor lies. The highest rank attainable on the date of enlistment is E-4/specialist with a degree. Plus, theres a time in grade requirement to make the rank of E-5. Also, some units require that the solider attend an NCOES course prior to attaining the rank of Sergeant...not all units go by this, but some do. Anyhow, ask your neighor what the maximum effective range of bullsh** is.|`|m6EkpZNfaa	He's a liar than. The highest he could go from day one is an E-4. Sgt. is an E-5. That rank is earned, not given for a little bit of school.
WR3JgCxPaa	Pumps as you probably know work at different rates and you didn't give any specifics as to what is enough to suit you in a mobile home.    The links below provides pricing for new pumps.  Of course used pump pricing is hard to guage depending on where you live and the condition of the pump.    Lowest price found at this link:  http://www1.shopzilla.com/8B--Swimming_P...      For strictly used prices you would probably wise to call several  wholesale plumbing companies in your area.    Good luck.
fNaDL2D1aa	All are great! It really depends on which university you attend and which program can give you a scholarship. Not all ROTCs are available at every school.

So it is what armed forces is your choice.  I am a former officer in the army and was treated fairly.  So you need to decide which service has the benefits you want|`|AA12244965	Really depends what you're looking for. If you're only joining the military for the education benefits, then maybe you should go for an easier military branch. And so far, I'm aware the Air Force is the easiest of them all. And ROTC is somewhat more laid back as you don't give into the career ALL the time. Or you can pick which you like most: planes, ships or guns? 
YBiJRC0Raa	SIEMPRE  ha habido.  De quien son las gasolineras ?, las empresas que distribuyen el gas domstico?, las empresas que hacen la obra pblica mediante licitaciones?

Y si hay inversin privada...lo sabemos (la empresa del papa de Mouri?o por ejemplo) pero NO en actividades reservadas al estado tal cual lo establece la constitucin.    Y se debe reformar la situacin actual de los privados, que a mil voces se sabe se llevan TONELADAS de billetes por servicios ama?ados y poco utiles.|`|RVGhTYCwaa	En pemex es necesaria la inversion privada, porque el gobierno esta pobre y nosotros tambien.|`|dZTI9nR6aa	Por supuesto que se sabe que en PEMEX hay inversin privada, sin ir lejos, los contratos que celebr el propio Caldern (completamente violatorios de la Constitucin), con empresas canadienses y espa?olas) pero perdname, dudo mucho que la mejor medida a tomar en el caso de contratos que violaron disposiciones Constitucionales o de cualquier otra ilegalidad, sea reformar la Constitucin o las Leyes que de ella emanan, para que se adecuen al ilcito, como que no me suena muy lgico y mucho menos, legal, legtimo y tico.  Ahora, espero que no ests confundiendo las figuras de inversin privada (como la que antes contrat y ahora pretende legalizar Caldern con su reforma), con la contratacin de empresas privadas que se hace al amparo de la Ley de Adquisiciones, Arrendamientos y Servicios del Sector Pblico y su Reglamento.  Oye, una duda, pues por ms que leo y releo la propuesta de Caldern no encuentro el mecanismo adecuado e insoslayable para definir esto de la productividad de cada uno de los inversores privados, Cmo hara el estado, de aprobarse tal propuesta, para verificar estricta y honestamente lo que haga cada una de las empresas a las que se les pretende traspasar la realizacin de actividades hasta ahora reservadas al estado? Ms fcil, Cmo se llevar el control de algo tan simple como el nmero de barriles de petrleo que saque una empresa privada para luego refinarlo? De acuerdo con dicha propuesta, Mxico se reserva la propiedad del petrleo (del crudo, del lquido ***** tal como est en la tierra), es decir, vender a las empresas tal petrelo para que ellas lo procesen, Quin y como se fijar el precio del petrleo? Quin y cmo se llevar la cuenta de cunto petrleo han extrado cada empresa? Cules son las polticas de pago de tal materia prima? Qu onda con los impuestos que ahora paga PEMEX (y que son fuente importantsima de recursos para el estado) cuando estn a cargo de las empresas? Cmo van a recuperar su inversin las empresas privadas a quienes se les transfieran las actividades de exploracin, explotacin y refinacin del petrleo? Quin y cmo se fijarn los precios, por ejemplo, del litro de gasolina de esa que compramos los humildes mortales para que nuestro coche camine? Son dudas que tengo desde hace rato y que espero t me podrs resolver, lo cual desde ahora te agradezco.    PEJEFAN, t siempre tan ajeno a la informacin, por supuesto que este tema lo ha tratado AMLO en las reuniones, el problema es que con esto de cerco informativo que no permite que se sepa nada de l, pues no sale en televisa pero algunos peridicos (adems de La Jornada) s lo dicen, cosa de vencer la flojera de leer y si de plano esto de la lectura no es lo tuyo, tambin hay algunas estaciones de radio que s hablan de lo que va haciendo y diciendo AMLO.|`|LPxuOcNLaa	Pues ms que regular, lo que pretende la anticonstitucional reforma de Caldern es legalizar los negocios de las empresas en las que funcionarios y lideres sindicales corruptos tienen acciones.    ?Por qu crees que Romero Deschamps no dice nada?

4KLoQYtyaa	Lol, first of all liberals conveniently ignore the fact that those 4,000 soldiers CHOSE to serve and die for their country, something they would never do because they're a bunch of weak sissies who would rather be lead like sheep to the slaughter than pick up a gun and defend their families.     They don't see the babies as "babies," they also (conveniently,) choose to see them as "parasites," rather than an innocent, living human being. Liberalism isn't about logic and sense, as we all know. It's all about their precious "feelings." |`|SWeT6MGpaa	It's a volunteer army. I've never heard of a baby volunteering to be aborted.    Sure you may come up with an excuse to abort a baby, but you can't come up with a valid excuse to deny medical treatment to babies who inadvertently survive late term abortions outside of the womb.|`|9ujT56Maaa	Why do conservatives not understand that there's a difference between a parasitic zygote and a human being? It's not that hard, we all learned it in high school biology.|`|AKWhYaS5aa	Geeze dude shut the **** up. You know the answer. Liberals don't believe that fetuses are living things. I'm not saying that they are or they aren't, but please at least research what each side believes before you take a radical opinion on it. This was like that thing where everyone in America holds a strong position one way or the other on Iraq, yet one seventh of them can't point to where it is on the map!|`|FESuSCIOaa	Abortion is a RELIGOUS issue. We need to get it out of the political conversation. A fetus is not a baby; I don't believe the life of the soul begins at conception; and those who are on the other side of the issue cannot prove me wrong. It's a matter of faith. Your faith, and my faith. We have a right to believe what we believe without this constant harassment. No one is forcing pro-life populations to have abortions. So stop complaining that others of a different faith have the right to choose.
e9DR6N1Paa	I'd rather have Palin then that Obama-nation. |`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	No, Palin would not.  She is trying to do on the job training to learn about foreign policy.  There is a lot more to this job, then that.  She needs to go home to Alaska, and get ready to be a Grandmother and stop trying to act like one of the Good old Boys.      Obama/Biden in 08.  |`|lDbNf3h9aa	She scares me.|`|0eFSeap5aa	I'll take her over Obama.  Though your point about McCain's belligerence is well taken.|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Yes|`|QC94lBXOaa	Does a bear Sh*t in a solid gold bowl?   NO NO NO NO NO NO...A THOUSAND TIMES NOOOOOO. She would actually make us long for the Bush Administration.|`|PfBMvX1caa	She would not, and as a conservative, let me explain why.    The presidency is an extremely complicated job.  You have to have sufficient wisdom to know HOW to prioritize the affairs of the nation, how to delegate which duties properly, and which people to trust.    Palin doesn't even know what all the issues ARE, much less how to prioritize them.    She would be at the total mercy of her advisers.  Let's say Citigroup suddenly has to cover a series of unwinding derivatives positions, and is in danger of bankruptcy.  Palin would have exactly zero original thinking on this matter, because she knows nothing about the underlying issue.  She would defer to her advisers, and they would manipulate her.|`|A1dwrJrsaa	no way|`|txQurJwqaa	No she would not. No, No , No, No, No, No, No, No, No. No. Noo. One more No.|`|cab5b8dfd118bfb1a4d5f00a89395914aa	I would fear for my life, money, and safety if she gets in office and that with all politics aside. |`|EJTqMkj9aa	I can't believe McCain would go all the way up to Alaska to get a running mate. What the...? She is practically Canadian. As if we need a Canadian as our President. Look how disfunctional her family already is and they are not even out on their own. I mean, Alaska? She really has no experience, if that is the republican party's main argument against Obama. No, no, no!|`|DW489Iteaa	Are you kidding? Maybe if we did not value our reproductive rights,or wildlife and preservation of our natural resources, we did not think that it was important for our leaders to know who leads the other countries in the world and what there policies are. The experience is just not there. If I worked for McDonald's and I made the best hamburger at my store, do you think that they would offer me the CEO position? I am a woman and more important than getting a woman in the White House is having a capable government.|`|oQZ0ktvCaa	Go to the CBS site and look at Katie Couric's interview with Palin.  Seriously. You won't be able to believe it. If Palin is not hideously embarrassed by that interview, she ought to be. What a joke. In my opinion the only respectable thing she can do right now is resign from the ticket. It is glaringly obvious that she has no idea what she's talking about.|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	If you want a civil war, then sure.|`|de39f79ff7175ddba3dae7abc032fecbaa	No.|`|daf31a0f11d6dd2ff61a771f182635ddaa	Definitely yes.|`|7ce892cc4050e10ec9ceecb9421c3efdaa	Yes she would.|`|XE527cDpaa	She'll do fine.|`|Ic13HImWaa	HA. she wouldnt have any clue how to be our leader. the idea of McCain/Palin being in office scares the crap out of me.|`|qWVRCFxbaa	She'd be about as good as Paris Hilton.|`|Kn39UTe8aa	uhh yea.. i mean if she can govern alaska she can govern the whole US.... |`|M1kgwn9laa	no she is worse the bush|`|mRyG5Cvjaa	She would make a good president of the PTA at Wasilla High.  Not of these here United States of America.|`|idRvGHOEaa	My cat would make a better president than "Mrs.I can see Russia from my house".|`|CtCN1EmXaa	LOL|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Yes. And you are a paranoid delusional.|`|xwDzek6uaa	easily. She is more qualified to be President than Obama is.|`|zSpAZF9Oaa	Hey Nikki M - please don't insult the Canadian people.  Sarah is as American as they come, not one bit of Canadian in that woman.
noo8vpvzaa	Umm Sandra and Grobit..."Call me if you need me", isn't exactly 'multitasking' now is it?|`|IJTcGIG7aa	I support the future President that is out there talking to the people.....    ....not the guy who ran to Washington for a photo op to 'fix' the problem he caused (McCain is Mr Deregulation), by spending nearly a trillion dollars of our money.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Well Bush did call and Obama will meet with him tomorrow. McCain was also called and expected to attend. Before they were asked it may have seemed a distraction rather than helpful.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Hey, Bucko - Obama is not the president yet.  So he is not going to run to Washington like some cowboy to make everybody think he is saving the day.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Another meaningless Republican DISTRACTION.    McCain's boy, Gramm caused this mess through deregulation.  Now, the Democratic Congress will be asked to approve the bailout of the most incompetent administration in history.    Good job guys.  And instead of solving our economic problems, let's have a post titled "Obama is a Muslim."  Then source Fixed Noise or a little green man in the National Enquirer.  Pathetic.|`|dn0aF6lOaa	hahah nice twist of words... But the truth is Obama called McCain this morning and asked him to join with him and take a unified stand.. McCains reaction was to stop everything and use this crisis to his benefit by stating he is suspending his FAILING campaign because he eels he is more use in washington. hahaha McCain is on NO COMMITTEES that are even remotely discussing this matter... Who is he going to talk to ?? Come on don't be so naive and fall for his crap once again.. This was nothing but a political gimmick and is reported as such on EVERY news station except ofcourse Fox News.  Even the members on the committees are stating this is a political gimmick that is harming their own efforts to fix the problem.   In other words McCain stay out of this.. you have no clue!

That one back fired on him too.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	i want a pres and veep that are going to be dedicated to their job..cause..country..and the citizens..then worry about the foreign affairs...no matter who is elected..i will support him as all americans should and quit bashing and complaining as if we could do better|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Watched it live.

Uh-oh, now what will he do?     You get a star from me!     McCain/Palin 08!  Country First!|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	It's nothing new.    Obama votes "present" 70% of the time, except in this case, he won't even be present, but I guarantee you he'll be "present" to claim his paycheck!!!!    P.S.    "Multitasking" doesn't mean saying...hey...if there's anyway I can help, LET ME KNOW...    It means taking being PROACTIVE, not waiting for others to make decisions for you!!!|`|PG2gd1tOaa	Obama has millions and he doesn't give a rats *** about our economy other than to use this disaster for political gain, I think the polls will reflect this in the next few days...he's so bent on using it he refuses to put his campaign on hold for a few days, the fact that he won't tells you he's using it for politics but his drones will think this is honorable, what a joke.|`|C46DNX11aa	I like the kind that says call me if you need help because that person seem more sincere. One that takes off half cocked is not thinking and is wreckless! not to mention a McChicken. Obama/Biden 2008!|`|GEnKe7UBaa	"Call me if you need me" is NOT multitasking.    It's avoiding your responsibilities.    It's a nice way of saying "I'm doing something I would MUCH prefer doing, so don't call me unless you really, really, really, really have no other choice!!!    Anybody that has ever worked has heard this from a co-worker.

He instead will be going to Washington to help pass a resolution to our economic crisis. We need action like this...not words and speeches. We don't need our candidates to tell us what they plan to do, we need to see the action of there beliefs. Obama has decided politics mater more to him than the Americans financial troubles. McCain Is not trying to avoid this debate . he has been requesting for one since the primary's and Obama has refused on three occasions. McCain has faced things in life much tougher than this.... ie Prisoner of war which i remind you he had a option to leave with out the others but refused and would not leave until all were free. As a marine still in active duty this grabs at what heart strings i have left. Do your armed forces a favor and vote McCain because his plan is to bring us home as winners and not the failures Obama had hope for|`|LuZBTmgGaa	I want a President that knows he can help and does it, not one that needs somebody to tell him how he can be helpful.|`|aoVbrUFOaa	The economy will be going down the tubes and Obama will be getting head from Larry Sinclair, shades of Bill Clinton.|`|cc7d59b2f759cb76066d1729965f5247aa	I would want a President that steps up to the plate instead of waiting to be asked for help in something he should already be helping in|`|idRvGHOEaa	I prefer a president that doesn't attempt to use a economical disaster as a photo-op.

I'd prefer a president who had some understanding of economics, not someone who admitted they didn't.     I'd prefer a president who doesn't speak about honor and integrity, then lie thru his teeth whenever he feels like it.    I'd prefer a president who is loyal. Who doesn't abandon his previous swimsuit model wife, mother of his 3 oldest children, who also waited for him while he was trapped in a Vietnam prison camp, only to get in a car accident and get disfigured. Then when her hubby comes home he goes looking for another young hot lady and dumps her.    I don't want a president like that, plus McCain can't do anything  to help in Washington, he would probably make it worse. So why does he need to be there, what bright ideas is he going to come up with?  |`|pWbA7MRaaa	Obama is such a joke! Now he will probably go since President Bush called him. He wouldn't want to look like the highly partisan Senator that he is. He will now want to look like a problem solver and one who can reach across the isle.....a new experience for him!!|`|xwDzek6uaa	Step up.|`|4m12KHMwaa	Okay, I definitely think McCain is right on this one. He just solidified my vote for him. Wow, that's exactly what we need. A man who will roll his sleeves up and take action. "multitasking" is not "just call me if you need me." As nominees for president, they should both have a vested interest in resolving this terrible financial crisis.     Well, Obama has no excuse now. He has been called by the President. I hope that he realizes how serious this is and that he will suspend his campaign now. |`|ULgVhPYfaa	Being a SOCOM team leader for 14 Years, It was instilled in all of  my members that anytime they could be called upon to step up  and take over. I couldn't wait to send them a invitation and they  knew it. Its called lead follow or get the hell out of the way,    Obama is a follower with a false leaders mentality. I can only say  this in all sincerity, Obama subscribes to wait and see and then  what ever makes ME look best is the way he bends,    Sorry excuse for a leader wanna be as you wiill ever see.|`|9UdignpRaa	one that steps up to the challenge...|`|2281e5c7bb56fa196c78a97c53fb5437aa	One that can multi task in good times and hard times.|`|FFTsSyuuaa	i think that is a fine statement|`|7hVFxNqnaa	Would you prefer a president to fix your economic woes who was involved in a scandalous financial past, err.

The only reason McCain is so gung ho about rushing off to DC is because he is desperate to get out of the debate. He knows he is going to get creamed.|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	You made an excellent observation!  We think alike!  I gave you a star for bringing this up.|`|QUrqswahaa	I want my President to put me and my country first, not throw an aside over their shoulder "to be called if needed"..... spare me.|`|3K78rEWOaa	McCain isn't the most analytical man when it comes to the economy and how finances play a part in it. Yet him going to Washington is going to save the world???    This "I'm suspending my campaign" ploy is doing anything BUT.     The fact that he wants to push the bailout through ASAP tells me that he's just fine with socialism for the rich. Socialism? Everyone was saying Obama wanted that...now we have the republicans trying to scare everyone by saying "you will lose your homes, your jobs, your retirement unless this bill passes immediately!!!"    Kinda like how the reps pushed for the Iraq war saying "you will be under attack unless we do this! You are hated, you are unsafe, you are targeted."    Scare tactics to get the American people to support this. Yet 90% of the American people don't want this. The politicians were wrong about the so-called "War on Terror" (we still have some uninformed nimrods still believing that propaganda) and now they are pushing for this under the guise of fear.    They should all be hanged French Revolution style.

First, Senator Obama doesn't, you know, lie to the American people every damn day. Second, Senator Obama didn't vote with the dishonest, corrupt Bush administration 90 percent of the time.    But one of the main reasons why the nation appears to be lining up against Senator McCain's insanely obvious lack of integrity could be because his very serious and mavericky campaign strategy can be described in four simple words:     Blurt Out Random Crap.     "Crap," in this context, is defined as everything from lies to weasel-words to inexplicably weird nonsense. And it seems like Senator McCain does this a lot. So much so that we can only conclude that it's intentional.     OBAMA/BIDEN 2008    |`|uKaj1kHfaa	Why do white racists always have to pose as black people on here? You're not fooling anyone. I think Obama is running a relatively clean campaign compared to McCain. McCain is making shots at Obama for every. little. thing. Example: lipstick on a pig. The underdog ALWAYS runs the dirtiest campaign because he/she feels the need to do so. If you notice, many of the negative McCain ads come from political groups not affiliated with Obama. Trust me, living in Ohio, I think I have a better idea than you do of who is running the dirtiest campaign.|`|jtzqqilsaa	Obama's campaign doesn't bring up the bullshit like McCain's campaign does (the Britney ad, the lipstick-on-a-pig ad, etc).     Obama brings the REAL issues up front, while McCain like a true Republican dumbs those down, hides them and plays on people's insecurities and doubts.|`|b23cP1KPaa	FREE TICKETS: I have 4 free tickets to the Robbie Knievel attempted jump in Denver tonight..it seems Robbie will attempt to jump 10,000 Obama supporters with a bull dozer..I'm almost sure this will be his first failed jump.

Obama has been nothing but a gentleman in his rebuttals to McCain's low blows.  If you consider Obama standing up against McLame's false statements and accusations, then you are totally mistaken that he is belittling Mr. McBush.

Ugw1nNxxaa	That is very possible.  Imagine, after all the work that had been done having someone who does not even understand the economy come in and try to say he could not be done without him.  What a slap in the face for our Republican congress people.|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	yeah......that was a wrong move all together.....doesn't show him as thinking of the country.....more of a running from a fight.....and using the white house to hide him....|`|FhKfyxWlaa	He's still there.|`|VgOCLskYaa	All of us the democrats wanted to make out like Obama rode in on his white horse and saved the day instead he did not have any intelligent input or he would have held a "lovefest" with the media.

Little do you know, that McCain already did part of what he went there to do.   The Republicans are happy he came, do you not watch the news?  He was requested to come.    The Dems didn't want him there, why?  Because he exposes their deception!|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	I do. He was no help and made matters worse.

McCain is giving his input as he should!|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Unscrupulous borrower Chris Dodd and Dingy Harry Reid are holding a blame-McCain press conference. After stomping his feet up and down and baiting McCain to take a position on the bailout, Reid is now lambasting McCain for going to Washington and getting involved. We dont need presidential politics in this, he whines. Then why did he publicly demand McCain go on record for or against the bailout?!    (Bill Sammon on FNC on Reids laughable claim that a deal was on the table and ready to go before McCain arrived and messed it up: Patently false.)    Thank God for the House Republicans.    More: Chuck Schumer tells McCain to Get out of town. A friend on the Hill sends the transcript of Schumers remarks (see end of the transcript) and asks: But what about the Congressmen that created this mess? Shouldnt they leave town too?    Exactly.    |`|69HuMPALaa	They should. LOL|`|AA10254410	My newspaper said, "Obama peppered Paulson with questions, while McCain said little."

That's like quoting Ann Coulter. Actually,more like Hitler|`|5ynxAT2Paa	Hell no! If you haven't noticed, nobody tells John McCain what to do and he doesn't care what people think of him. He does what he feels is best for his country, even if it means crossing party lines. Some in Washington don't like him for that; as a patriot, I love him for that.    He went in there and shook things up, and like it or not, like McCain or not, he woke 'em all up, Dems & Reps so they would actually get something done. The Congress has been sitting on this for almost a week. McCain was there for little more than a day & it was just announced less than an hour ago that they plan to have a bill signed by midnight tonite.     And yes, Bush did have to call Barry "its all about me" Obama and tell him to get his *** on a plane and do his job. Imagine that.    Dems, you cannot win this one! Sorry.|`|qY8ni6fKaa	Lol.

A6q6Ravhaa	i think the debate went well McCain had a strong nite, McCain had 7 or 8 attacks and knocked obama off balance McCain had come off with a good style obama comes off as rounded edges and not direct. McCain got under his skin obama didn't counter punch. i will say both did a pretty good job but i still have to say McCain took the bull by the horns. McCain drove home his point especially on foreign policy's. so my vote on the debate and for president still goes to McCain  |`|cOXBegMhaa	No.  I feel that Obama won the debate. He was strong and much more presidential than McCain. He was able to look McCain in the eyes. McCain kept looking down, and he would not talk directly to Obama. I don't know if that is because it is harder to tell a lie directly to someone's face, but McCain just did not look presidential. McCain also distorted the truth, and Obama had to correct him several times. McCain did not have to correct Obama. Obama also showed that he truly has better judgment.|`|9eBruYtqaa	i feel they both did a great job holding their ground. |`|706923d60f2f71ebae89f975ca070066aa	I was watching on CNN and they had an audience meter on the screen showing audience reaction and I noticed that it was on the plus side for nearly the whole debate for both candidates. It rarely if ever went into the negative zone, which I guess means the both did very well.    One thing I noticed those is whenever McCain got agressive the approval rating dropped very quickly.|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	No|`|AA10289446	No. Obama won the debate hands down. He came across as more genuine, truthful and thoughtful. McCain looked like he was about to explode. |`|KrrXT6ocaa	McCain reminded me of the veteran detective who knew how to look for clues and question suspects.    Obama looked like he had read a few Hardy Boy books.|`|e067020ff447ba0c1bc5395d1b7783bcaa	I think he was weak on actual plan although he painted lovely anecdotes from his past. If you check a lot of his facts are wrong. Look at his voting record at votesmart.org (non-partisan) and you will see. I think Obama should have worked harder to call McCain out on the inaccuracies and falsehoods he stated throughout the debate. |`|fKPHLjYPaa	I don't think either of them won.  Both said some things that left me scratching my head and both gave me food for thought and things that I need to research.  There were things that both said that I couldn't quite swallow and both of them had good things - McCain with the experience angle and Obama with his bipartisanship seeming to give ground when it was necessary and his willingness to say that McCain was right when he was.  I didn't like that McCain seemed more than a little condescending about any number of things and I didn't like the fact that every other time the camera was on him he was smiling or chuckling.  I didn't see anything funny.  I didn't like how Obama sometimes seemed a bit vague with his answers.|`|ZeHJ014Jaa	Only if you're republican John Mccain was horrible he reminded me of a grandfather telling stories about the old days|`|f79fqDneaa	yeah, he did'nt sound old, Obama still looks Black|`|9nQ39d4Iaa	Love the Liberals answers.  McCain won.  What was with Obama and his father wanting to come to America so badly?  His father slept with tons of women. Then left when Obama was born.  Obama was weak in a lot of his answers. And this um...uh.... |`|dKPFjQymaa	He lost it big time, any educated individual can see that.|`|CUVYxMF1aa	Hands down.|`|Hh4bWQvEaa	nope, not even close|`|lKWLGtCcaa	He surely did.|`|78BZKEuraa	No|`|OnWmqs4paa	Yes no question about it obama just could not understand anybody disagreeing with him!  Obama kept mouthing the word raciest, I guess that is the old go to defense...
VCpE1jWkaa	I'm in Arizona and I see hardly any RNC ads. That's because Obama is not really trying to win Arizona (bummer), McCain's home state.  You're seeing a lot of ads because Virginia is a critical battleground state. I feel for you, buddy! The RNC plays dirty and does nothing but lie and distort better than anyone. Hang in there!|`|6QPQNxYLaa	Good he deserves it  I've been wondering when the Republicans were gonna step up and do their job    They can't expect O'Reilly to do it all!    Did you see Barney Franks get his butt kicked on Bills show?  It was price less  The media has been in the tank for Obama forever and it's about time the truth comes out about this guy  Oh I'm from Jersey and they hate their Democratic Governor with a passion so I wouldn't be so sure that it's in the pocket for Obama    Go McCain Palin|`|xqChbB2raa	well, I will say that seeing states like Indiana, Virginia and North Carolina possibly going Democrat is really something.  North Carolina has not gone Democrat since Jimmy Carter won it in 1976, and Indiana and Virginia last went Democrat when Lyndon Johnson won them in 1964.      Obama is not going to waste time in states that he knows he can't possibly win.  Like for instance, he would not even bother going to a state like Utah, because that state will go red even before the votes are all counted.  They know after seeing about 60% of the vote how it's going to go, just like Texas, Wyoming, Kansas, Alaska, Idaho and Nebraska.  Just like McCain is not going to waste time in a state like California or New York, he knows he won't win those states|`|AA10560132	No, I haven't seen any at all. All I do is read these things about Obama that his supporters ignore. Very scary huh?  Around 1979 Obama started college at Occidental in California . He is very open about his two years at Occidental, he tried all kinds of drugs and was wasting his time but, even though he had a brilliant mind, did not apply himself to his studies. 'Barry' (that was the name he used all his life) during this time had two roommates, Muhammad Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid, both from Pakistan . During the summer of 1981, after his second year in college, he made a 'round the world' trip. Stopping to see his mother in Indonesia , next Hyderabad in India , three weeks in Karachi , Pakistan where he stayed with his roommate's family, then off to Africa to visit his father's family. My question - Where did he get the money for this trip? Nether I, nor any one o f my children would have had money for a trip like this when they where in college. When he came back he started school at Columbia University in New York . It is at this time he wants everyone to call him Barack - not Barry. Do you know what the tuition is at Columbia ? It's not cheap to say the least! Where did he get money for tuition? Student Loans? Maybe. After Columbia , he went to Chicago to work as a Community Organizer for $12,000 a year. Why Chicago ? Why not New York ? He was already living in New York .  By 'chance' he met Antoin 'Tony' Rezko, born in Aleppo Syria , and a real estate developer in Chicago . Rezko has been convicted of fraud and bribery this year. Rezko, was named 'Entrepreneur of the Decade' by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association'. About two years later, Obama entered Harvard Law School . Do you have any idea what tuition is for Harvard Law School ? Where did he get the money for Law School ? More student loans? After Law school, he went back to Chicago . Rezko offered him a job, which he turned down. But, he did take a job with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland. Guess what? They represented 'Rezar' which is Rezko's firm. Rezko was one of Obama's first major fina ncial contributors when he ran for office in Chicago . In 2003, Rezko threw an early fundraiser for Obama which Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendelland claims was instrumental in providing Obama with 'seed money' for his U.S. Senate race. In 2005, Obama purchased a new home in Kenwoood District of Chicago for $1.65 million (less than asking price). With ALL those Student Loans - Where did he get the money for the property? On the same day Rezko's wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot for full price. The London Times reported that Nadhmi Auchi, an Iraqi-born Billionaire loaned Rezko $3.5 million three weeks before Obama's new home was purchased. Obama met Nadhmi Auchi many times with Rezko.  Now, we have Obama running for President. Valerie Jarrett, was Michele Obama's boss. She is now Obama's chief advisor and he does not make any major decisions without talking to her first. Where was Jarrett born? Ready for this? Shiraz , Iran ! Do we see a pattern here? Or am I going crazy?  On May 10, 2008 The Times reported, Robert Malley, advisor to Obama, was 'sacked' after the press found out he was having regular contacts with 'Hamas', which controls Gaza20and is connected with Iran . This past week, buried in the back part of the papers, Iraqi newspapers reported that during Obama's visit to Iraq, he asked their leaders to do nothing about the war until after he is elected, and he will 'Take care of things'.  Oh, and by the way, remember the college roommates that where born in Pakistan ? They are in charge of all those 'small' Internet campaign contributions for Obama. Where is that money coming from? The poor and middle class in this country? Or could it be from the Middle East ?  And the final bit of news. On September 7, 2008, The Washington Times posted a verbal slip that was made on 'This Week' with George Stephanapoulos. Obama on talking about his religion said, 'My Muslim faith'. When questioned, 'he made a mistake'. Some mistake!  All of the above information I got on line. If you would like to check it - Wikipedia, encyclopedia, Barack Obama; Tony Rezko; Valerie Jarrett: Daily Times - Obama visited Pakistan in 1981; The Washin gton Times     |`|e5bee84c10b988ab257f2051cdbe9650aa	No not in my state.

He's already written over 900 Presidential Orders that override the Constitution. His Iraq war has cost us billions, bin Laden is still there, a renewed Al_quida, gas prices all over the board, unemployment rising, businesses going out of business, housing values have plummeted, health care is still a wish for over 100,000,000 Americans.  I always ask my self...Am I better off today than when I was 8 years ago? I had a job, my retirement fund hadn't lost 45% of its value, I could afford a new car and gas, my house got paid for every month and we actually went out to eat once a month.  Today I'm not working, retirement is out of he question now, I can barely afford the car I have let alone think about a new one, I struggle to pay my mortgage each month and we never eat out or go to a movie.  No, I'm not better off today than 8 years ago.  Bush was president and for many years, Republicans had the majority in Congress.  Remember, even though the Democrats have a majority in Congress, it's only by one. Not enough to pass anything new without a 2/3rd's majority.  I agree the whole situation is a terrible mess right now. We've been neglecting health issues at home, the big increase of retirees soon, education, infrastructure, and many more things of equal importance.  We've spoiled our kids decades ago and they, in turn, spoiled their kids. Now it's all cell phones, text messaging, teenage pregnancies, drug use, gangs, driveby shootings, ignorance all over the place, crummy schools, gotta have it now mentality, education can come later, saving money? Gotta be kiddin', mentality.  There are a bunch of great young folks around...you just don't hear much about them.  Biggest mistakes we've made is getting off the gold standard (now the government can print as much money as they want to......that's why it's worth less and less.....we can't stay within a budget as a country or even at a state level. Politicians want to spend, spend, spend.  Seriously, Palin's Alaska is going to get $2,000,000 to study the hibernation habits of bears and squirrels!!!

But the American people have to learn to be a good neighbor to the rest of the world, which our nation is not.  We must learn to sort out the truth and refuse to allow the US's constant militarization of other nations (and flawed judgment-making, as regarding Israel) to continue.  It is our greedy and self-centered exploitation of other nations, for our personal gain, that has created Terrorism.    There would be no terrorism threat to the US if we had just let other nations live their own lives and establish their own destinies.  Bush's insane statement "They just hate those of us who love freedom" is frighteningly bizarre--and I fear that many Americans accepted that absurd statement without thinking about it.    Arabs and Muslims don't "hate" us for "loving freedom" (what a stupid notion).  Those that do hate the US do so because we have, and continue to, intrude on their lands and use other countries for our personal gain.    Common sense applies here.  'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'  Occupying other nations and killing 100,000s of their people does not win us friends or cultivate the trust of the world.      A poll in foreign countries peformed about 18 months ago found that 70-80% of the world population did NOT see 'Terrorism' as the world's greatest threat to world peace--instead, they saw the US as the world's greatest threat to world peace!    So what does that tell Americans?  That maybe we should start thinking about being 'good' to our neighbors instead of exploiting them for the US's wasteful, consuming 'needs.' Then there's the Big Negative fact that we're so quick to drop bombs and kill people--even though we prove to be wrong for doing so in the end.    "HOPE" for America lies in changing our ways.      PS:  I'm speaking as an 'army brat,' who grew up all my life on military bases--my brother was almost killed in the bombing of the US Embassy in Kuwait in the 80s (Bill's secretary and 7 other people were killed--Bill's wife was almost one of them, but she survived).  So NO, I'm not "anti-military"--I LOVE our troops!   I just don't want to see our soldiers (and 100,000s of other innocent people) dying for political agendas, like Bush's pie-in-the-sky belief that 'democratizing' barren Iraq would bring about world peace (? Bush should have listened to the experts).     We must never again allow a US president's lies convince us that attacking an innocent nation (Iraq),  BTW, Bush lied to Congress to get them to "support" by giving him a blank check to start a war (but only IF NECESSARY). Bush abused his power--he fully intended to take misled Congress's 'approval' before the UN to give him more backing.    Proof that Bush lied to Congress?  DIANNE FEINSTEIN, FIERCELY ANTI-WAR, signed Bush's 'blank check' approval to start war but ONLY IF NECESSARY.  FEINSTEIN WAS DUPED by a dishonest president and administration, as were all the Congressional signers.

u6ALw1gAaa	We see evidence of crime being committed all the time.  Yet we do not arrest everyone.  An Officer must achieve a standard of Probable Cause in order to make an arrest.  Probable Cause is defined as: A reasonable belief that a person has committed a crime. The test the courts employ to determine whether probable cause existed for purposes of arrest is whether facts and circumstances within the Officer's knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe a suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.  It is actually a fairly low standard to achieve, however, without it no arrest can be made.  The Officer may have evidence but may not have enough to feel comfortable arresting you.      It is not uncommon to not arrest people that you know broke the law.  This can be done for any number of reasons, including simply not wanting to go through the trouble of arresting someone for a minor crime.  The explanations are as infinite as the possible encounters.|`|9gsm05lnaa	He has to present it to the DA, adn then the DA can decide if they want to file charges on you.|`|AA11525891	Simple, either (s)he is bluffing or they have to complete their investigation.

Rules are generally different for misdemeanors and vary by jurisdiction.  Misdemeanors generally have to happen in the officer's presence, otherwise, they must obtain a warrant to arrest you.    If they are investigating a crime, even though they have evidence to make them suspect that you may have been invovlved, it may not be adequate (i.e. probable cause) to make an arrest.    They often need to corroberate the evidnce they have.  If they suspect you of a felony, they must read you the Miranda warning before they question you.  If they think you may be a witness, the Miranda warning may not be necessary at first.|`|AA11909996	ell, that depends. If the crime he is talking about is a misdemeanor, he can't arrest you unless he witnessed it. Well, let me back up a second. In some jurisdictions that is the case...in others in that circumstance you would receive a citation for the offense. It depends greatly on the specific offense and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Now, if it was a felony, I think it is likely he would have been handcuffing you as he told you that.  |`|csGKIic9aa	Cause they want u to fess up if u did do something.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Agreed.    I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:    1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 30 years in the U.S., over 100 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.    Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:    2. Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason  1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.    3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually higher in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida  the most active execution state at the time  to carry out his final murder spree).  It could be that the high cost (see  2) drains resources from police departments, education, and other government programs that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it has to do with your point about the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murderby killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, do as I say, not as I do.    4. Theres also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DONT have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, I wish you had killed me.  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."    5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects an eye for an eye (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that God is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  Leviticus 19:18 warns against vengeance (which, really, is what the death penalty amounts to).  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."  |`|Ip4nhAmAaa	An eye for an eye. Those who kill for fun don't deserve the holy gift of life.|`|jT7Ik5a4aa	The death penalty is used to remove from this earth those that have chosen to perpetrate very heinous crimes. God gives authority to governments to enact laws to protect its citizens. Killing a man or woman who has chosen to do a serious crime is 2 fold. It is a message to those that would do the same thing, and exercising a God-given authority and obligation to enforce the law of the land. It is not immoral to kill in certain instances, even in the Bible;    Exodus 21:14 But if a man schemes and kills another man deliberately, take him away from my altar and put him to death.  |`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	Good question.  As the number of people wrongfully convicted yet sentenced to death increases, more and more Americans are taking a fresh look at the system itself.  Realizing that any system devised by human beings is bound to have errors, they are questioning the morality of the death penalty itself.    When you look at the death penalty system in action, you see that the only purpose it serves is retribution or revenge, it is seriously (and intrinsically) flawed in application and that there is a serious and continuing risk of executing innocent people.  And, it costs much more than life in prison.  It is critical to get out the facts.    130 people on death rows have been released with proof that they were wrongfully convicted. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, cant guarantee we wont execute innocent people. If someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.    The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. No reliable study shows the death penalty deters others. Homicide rates are higher in states and regions that have it than in those that dont.    Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. Life without parole costs less than the death penalty.    The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, mostly because of the upfront costs of legal process which is supposed to prevent executions of innocent people. (upfront=before and during the initial trial)    The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?    Families of murder victims are not unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.    Problems with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.

I think the death penalty is a waste of life. Those persons should be donated to science, so that perhaps a cure could be found for their morbid minds, depending on the case, of course.    Some people kill for selfish reasons, like for pleasure or theft, etc (should be donated to science). Some for personal reasons, like vengeance, for example: catching their wife in bed with another (should be locked up for life in solitary).|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	One reason may be so that the killers are not able to kill again, to protect the innocent sometimes we have to do things that are unpleasant?

Indeed, self-defense even to the point of killing your assailant is something of a moral imperative. The state also is not a person and will not have the motives of the individual. There's also a very low recidivism rate in those executed.  I'm guessing you're young and don't have extensive life experience. You'll find there are people who aren't amenable to rehabilitation. There is, for instance, no effective treatment for psychopathy.  It is indeed a complex subject, but then the law takes that into account: there are various degrees of murder and manslaughter, and judges and juries have some discretion.  I personally am opposed to the death penalty on practical grounds, but I've never seen any moral contradictions.|`|AA11525891	The way I look at it is that certain people have lost their right to continue to exist.No hypocrisy in my mind. It is some what analogous to someone who embezzles money is fined. In other words he steals and we take his money away. Not much different than a cop killing someone to save a life.|`|jKLIKDJ3aa	The death penalty is suppose to scare you into not committing the crime ... the problem is that it doesn't work as a deterrent    a life sentence is only 25 years in some states     here is the good (and the bad) news, if you don't like the laws you can change them|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	They choose to take some innocent persons life so they forfeit their right to live or maybe they should given the choice between death or spending the rest of their natural life in jail.  |`|7a8qCNU2aa	Well the whole thing against people murdering people is the part where the victim may not have deserved to be killed.    When execution arises, it has been generally accepted that the person in question deserves to be killed.    I disagree with this practice, mainly because so many people recently have proven their innocence with new DNA-identifying technologies.    On the other hand- it costs a great deal to house/feed/provide healthcare to these people who are criminals. I'm a hard working, mostly law-biding person, and I get crappier treatment from the government than a murderer or rapist. That's a hard thought for me to swallow.    I don't really see any misuse of the death penalty, it's not like people get sentenced for theft or usually even the murder of a single person. So, my only issue is whether they're truly guilty- which is much easier to prove nowadays thanks to more modern technology.    In short, I say FRY 'EM! =D|`|6sgi2fUraa	You're absolutley right. If the capital punishment is enforced, then the people who enforce it are no better than the convicted themselves. There are no loop holes round 'thou shalt not kill'!!|`|aTAUOI8caa	I doubt you'd be a good lawyer if you care about morals this much.    True morality in our justice system has nothing to do with the presence or absence of hypocrisy.  The only thing that matters is what the executioner is willing to inflict for a crime.    Yes, it may be hypocritical to kill to punish killing, since both are really the same--the ending of a life.      The difference is that murder is wrong because we are willing to punish it; and the death penalty is right because we are willing to let that killing go without punishment.      Human morality cannot be bothered with things like hypocrisy.  |`|Ro5fOqlBaa	A life sentence does not mean until you die of old age. And regardless what the non death penalty sentence is it is always possible to be let out.    But to directly answer your question, the biggest reason for the death penalty is a deterrent to others who might be thinking about it.  Of course, thanks to the news it appears that it is totally worthless as a deterrent. But history shows us otherwise. As an example, even back in the wild west it was very rare for anyone to be killed during a robbery(except for those committed by a few) because they knew that if no one died they couldn't get the death penalty.    but I have never seen a law written that says anything like "because it is immoral to kill we will make it illegal and give the death penalty to those who commit".    The simple fact is killing is very legal. Murder however is a different story altogether.     Since the simplest and probably most accurate definition of murder is killing without a legally acceptable reason, then it can be argued that giving the death penalty is perfectly acceptable. It would depend on your definition of what a good reason is.

AND no not the best bar far. |`|KhBmlaefaa	No he is not. But if he is elected I hope not because Biden as President? LMFAO, we would all be in trouble then. Of course we would be in trouble if Obama was President too, so who knows!|`|en7wgVfyaa	You have a wicked imagination.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	NO, he sure ISN'T the best! I shall not prognosticate on the second part of this question!|`|shtP63traa	I think he's the best candidate available.    As for assassination, that's a threat for any president.  Security around the president is generally pretty tight, especially after the Kennedy assassination and the attempt on Reagan.  I'm sure the Secret Service will be as cautious with him as they would be with McCain or anyone else.|`|QK5oaL4oaa	If George W.

He is still human and he has a family. |`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	I've worked three Presidential security details with local police; once for Clinton, and two for Bush.  Let me say this, I highly doubt a President will ever be assassinated again.  You have no idea the planning and money that goes into protecting a president at a single event.  I'm basing this just off the scant things I found out about Bush's security detail.    As an example, the secret service has agents posted in the sewers following the entire path of the presidential motorcade; if attacked, there is a pothole opening at the bottom of the limo.  They drive it over a sewer pothole and drop the president down underground with the secret service, and escort him out of harms way.  The SUV'S you see with the limo have m60's and grenade launchers inside.    I asked one secret service agent "what would happen if someone fired on the motorcade from a large crowd"; his answer, "there'd be a lot of collateral damage".|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	Yes he's the Best and Yes he'll probably be the next Black Leader to be shot. Just like Martin Luther King Jr.|`|CYXQ4uwvaa	That is one of the biggest fears I have. America will be thrown into a tail spin if that happens and the mother of all race wars will happen.

I heard months and months ago that if he's elected, he may be assassinated.    But he's the Antichrist, so that's not possible.|`|AA10140467	why do you think he will be assassinated?

I know it's probably silly to worry about but I do.|`|AA12106492	Yes I think he is the best choice.  As for your second question, I would hope not but I can not really say.  I would rather not encourage that sort of thinking.|`|BTyvkrGaaa	Barack Obama is a great guy, he seems like a better President than John McCain would ever make.    He has better answers for the problems that face America, and will finally get us out of Iraq.|`|AA10554300	well as i see it he is the best that we have to choose from. i think hillary would have been the best over all though but that aint happening so obama would be the next best. as for him being assassinated well not sure if he will actually be assassinated but i do think there is a chance that an attempt might be made at the very least because of all the rednecks and racist i have been hearing getting interviewed im sure one of them is mentally disturbed enough to give it a try.  i certainly hope not but think that the chance does exist.|`|HR5ijQLIaa	Why do people on the left always obsess about death?  You ask about McCain's death, when Tony Snow died, the left held a survey asking who should get the next brain tumor.  To bad one of your own was the next, but notice that no Republican acted like the left did?      I don't like Obama, but I would never wish him dead.  If, and that is a big if, he is elected, then we will deal with it and NOT plan his demise.|`|ZAqLzxq1aa	Definitely not near to best pres. I don't exactly think McCain is the best pick, but it's a vote against Obama and that's a good reason to vote for him. It's not that i wouldn't vote for an African American or Arabian American in this case, but i just don't think we need Obama in the white house.    I agree with what someone else mentioned, that an assassination of Obama would look bad for the Replican party. but i think it's a possibility but i think we are a lot better in this day and age then we were in the past.|`|jKLIKDJ3aa	I am leaning more and more to Obama.  McCain's negative campaigning is disturbing and disappointing. Also I don't like the fact that McCain has promised to appoint more Justices like Scalia.     the truth is anyone elected president of the U.S. faces the threat of assassination, even more so during war time.|`|SUuIHhjkaa	No and Yes. |`|659f7c2f116c35ecd6f2d63088afe314aa	Yeah we still live in racist world.|`|NmfwqQf5aa	This question is not appropriate.|`|285466a34d0961c1ac54895e036af8c7aa	The best!!

AA12325653	sounds like he is planning to invade.|`|5U1TTI7Taa	that is outright propaganda, and it's people like you who are destroying the country.|`|AA10560132	No, I did not know this at all. I have done some of my own research though.  Around 1979 Obama started college at Occidental in California . He is very open about his two years at Occidental, he tried all kinds of drugs and was wasting his time but, even though he had a brilliant mind, did not apply himself to his studies. 'Barry' (that was the name he used all his life) during this time had two roommates, Muhammad Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid, both from Pakistan . During the summer of 1981, after his second year in college, he made a 'round the world' trip. Stopping to see his mother in Indonesia , next Hyderabad in India , three weeks in Karachi , Pakistan where he stayed with his roommate's family, then off to Africa to visit his father's family. My question - Where did he get the money for this trip? Nether I, nor any one o f my children would have had money for a trip like this when they where in college. When he came back he started school at Columbia University in New York . It is at this time he wants everyone to call him Barack - not Barry. Do you know what the tuition is at Columbia ? It's not cheap to say the least! Where did he get money for tuition? Student Loans? Maybe. After Columbia , he went to Chicago to work as a Community Organizer for $12,000 a year. Why Chicago ? Why not New York ? He was already living in New York .  By 'chance' he met Antoin 'Tony' Rezko, born in Aleppo Syria , and a real estate developer in Chicago . Rezko has been convicted of fraud and bribery this year. Rezko, was named 'Entrepreneur of the Decade' by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association'. About two years later, Obama entered Harvard Law School . Do you have any idea what tuition is for Harvard Law School ? Where did he get the money for Law School ? More student loans? After Law school, he went back to Chicago . Rezko offered him a job, which he turned down. But, he did take a job with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland. Guess what? They represented 'Rezar' which is Rezko's firm. Rezko was one of Obama's first major fina ncial contributors when he ran for office in Chicago . In 2003, Rezko threw an early fundraiser for Obama which Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendelland claims was instrumental in providing Obama with 'seed money' for his U.S. Senate race. In 2005, Obama purchased a new home in Kenwoood District of Chicago for $1.65 million (less than asking price). With ALL those Student Loans - Where did he get the money for the property? On the same day Rezko's wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot for full price. The London Times reported that Nadhmi Auchi, an Iraqi-born Billionaire loaned Rezko $3.5 million three weeks before Obama's new home was purchased. Obama met Nadhmi Auchi many times with Rezko.  Now, we have Obama running for President. Valerie Jarrett, was Michele Obama's boss. She is now Obama's chief advisor and he does not make any major decisions without talking to her first. Where was Jarrett born? Ready for this? Shiraz , Iran ! Do we see a pattern here? Or am I going crazy?  On May 10, 2008 The Times reported, Robert Malley, advisor to Obama, was 'sacked' after the press found out he was having regular contacts with 'Hamas', which controls Gaza20and is connected with Iran . This past week, buried in the back part of the papers, Iraqi newspapers reported that during Obama's visit to Iraq, he asked their leaders to do nothing about the war until after he is elected, and he will 'Take care of things'.  Oh, and by the way, remember the college roommates that where born in Pakistan ? They are in charge of all those 'small' Internet campaign contributions for Obama. Where is that money coming from? The poor and middle class in this country? Or could it be from the Middle East ?  And the final bit of news. On September 7, 2008, The Washington Times posted a verbal slip that was made on 'This Week' with George Stephanapoulos. Obama on talking about his religion said, 'My Muslim faith'. When questioned, 'he made a mistake'. Some mistake!  All of the above information I got on line. If you would like to check it - Wikipedia, encyclopedia, Barack Obama; Tony Rezko; Valerie Jarrett: Daily Times - Obama visited Pakistan in 1981; The Washin gton Times     
quFT8vV0aa	Palin is a joke. America doesn't need a "hockey mom" or a vp to try to be women's across America's best friend, we need a LEADER! She avoided every question last night, what a waste of space. I can't even believe newspapers think she won the debate, it's outrageous! This woman completely rehearsed her little speeches to look good on camera.

I live in Big Lake, Ak just 10 miles from Sarah and she is real, honest and sincere. She is not the typical politician that people seem to vote for. At our Governor's picnics in July she came up to us all and talked to us just the way you see and hear her. And she was not running for office then.|`|1faDaHqWaa	Tell her that she's embarrassed women everywhere and she's a disgrace to the female gender.|`|848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	I'd offer her a job in a used car lot.

After all, she mixes politics with religion.  She wouldn't give a straight answer anyway.

If I did have a chance to talk to her, I would say this:    Hello, Ms. Palin.  Thank you for your willingness to serve your country.  You're a beautiful person and I wish you and your family the best of everything.    I donated to Planned Parenthood in your name and I had a card sent to the McCain campaign.  Please don't take that personally--I respect your choice and Bristol's not to have an abortion.  I probably would have made the same call.  However, it was significant that you HAD the choice and I would like you to consider maintaining that right for other women.    Abortion is not my top issue in this campaign.  The economy needs to improve, the enviroment needs to be protected, everyone needs healthcare and the war needs to end.    If you're elected, please let reason and good sense inform your judgement and keep in mind that not everyone believes as you do.    Have a wonderful day, and best of luck.  May the best candidate win.  I will be voting for Obama.

cn02edmraa	I think they dont care  and dont care if he was not born in Hawaii like he claims    In radical Islamic schools they are teaching children to hate America, but is this any different from a church teaching black children to hate white America. I understand that Barrack needed to have a base to get started in politics and a large church with lots of followers would definitely be a great help. But he should have quit the church long before starting his campaign so it would not have come in the election. It is also too bad that the liberal media did not run with the news about Reverend Wright until it was too late and he had the democratic nomination all but sewed up. But it is not too late for real Americans to vote for a man that loves America and not one that hates America.         I also understand that Barrack needed money and that is why he befriended William Ayers to help get money for his election bid and used Ayer's home to start his election. But I don't think I would have associated with a man that said he did not kill enough Americans and should have killed more to protest the Vietnam War. I also would not have attended meetings with this man to help school children learn that the American way of life is wrong and socialism is good, but I guess I am not Barrack.    Barrack has done the above things and i stand by this answer and will prove it with any links reqested.    Also on fact check .org the obama tax plan is impossible because he calims he will give 95% of americans a tax cut. 40% of americans alreaady do not pay taxes. Fact check goes on to say that Obama has proposed one trillion dollars in additional spending that cannot be paid for if he gives anyone a tax cut.|`|04c6f0020d54d895d5df2d20e39d5fb7aa	Mccain was not born in America.|`|49fLVp5yaa	Yes, the debate has been brought up in court - among other issues & that is a fact if anyone cares to do a little digging.

This will be a slow and painful torture type of Apocalypse. This will end in tears. The Obama hysteria is not merely embarrassing to witness, it is itself contributory to the scale of the disaster that is coming. What we are experiencing a deepening days of a global depression. The desperate suspension of disbelief by people of intelligence in a pathetic effort to hypnotize themselves into the delusion that it will be all right. It will not be all right    Obamas American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is like one of those toxic packages traded by bankers: it camouflages many unaffordable gifts to his client state. With a federal deficit already at $1.2 trillion, Obama wants to squander $825 billion (which will undoubtedly mushroom to more than $1 trillion) on creating 600,000 more government jobs and a further 459,000 in green energy (useless wind turbines and other Heath-Robinson contraptions favored by environmentalists).     It is crucial to recall the reality that lies behind the rhetoric. The media is still cocooned in a warm comfort zone of infatuation with Americas answer to god himself.

npjAmTj9aa	No, not necessarily,   as  Wes says it may be a case  of cognitive dissonance or else because they genuinely see dis-info within the truth which is a standard counter-intel technique to try to discredit the whole movement.  Too many 'truthers'  buy  hearsay or  unsubstantiated claims  as fact just because it comes from a source which in  other ways appears  accurate.     But anybody whom thinks there's never any conspiracies,other than those covered on the mass media, haven't got much to add to any discussion anyhow as they're ridiculously close-minded.     There's a middle ground between the two polar extremes -  those who buy into every conspiracy claim even if it lacks evidence to back it and those who are so naive/brainwashed/lacking critical thinking skills that they can't believe anything from a non-official source and dismiss any evidence for that reason.    That said there is without doubt agents and shills who work full out to muddy the waters as well. There is  a lot at stake in keeping the masses in the dark or at least  confused and on the leash of false leaders.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	The whole secret society thing is essentially a crock.  Those who hold the strings need not conspire with each other in secret.  In fact, you regularly read and hear about what they want out of you.    That is what's so insidious about it.  Society itself is now ordered around a few telling the many what to do, what to think, how to vote.  And it's done in a manner that most people support, under the auspices of "free speech".|`|tDZMJue9aa	yeah if you have nothing to hide why would you spend thousands of dollars to  keep it quiet, when that happens something stinks like crazy|`|97VqHCIRaa	I think they do that because they lack common sense and critical thinking skills.|`|0iOqIbfNaa	The world is a big place.

Also some people experience cognitive dissonance as a result of being confronted with information that conflicts that which they hold as truth , which is very unpleasant and always brings a vile reaction.|`|DY9NOh4taa	There are people who see conspiracies under every rock or action in the Government that takes place and there are more than enough websites that provide them with the fuel to continue their theories.  There are genuine conspiracies that have taken place, but often what happens is that a person will become so consumed with the conspiracy that they will go without food or sleep, and finally result in them developing a form of psychosis, in regard to that particular subject.  I don't believe that the person per-say, has anything to hide, it is a desire of theirs to fully understand the subject they feel is a conspiracy, and their desire to understand it overrides everything else in their life, as the study of this conspiracy consumes more and more of their time. Resulting in them withdrawing from people and activities to continue their search. Which results in them being labeled as conspiracy nuts, when in actuality they are merely trying to understand what happened in a particular situation.

Problem is when the roads are done, those people are out of work.  Obama is banking that the economy will have bounced back by then hoping the private sector will recover without help from the government while imposing higher taxes.|`|fqLo4HvKaa	As a matter of fact, I just spent 2 days evaluating our company's readiness to proceed on some stimulus-funded projects.    Every state has prepared a list of "shovel ready" highway and construction projects that will proceed with stimulus funding. Obama has given the states just 180 days to have everything in place.    In many states, the stimulus package will go directly to the state highway department, which then will administer its allocation.    Here in Arizona, the ADOT has divided the state into 5 regions, and teams of companies with on-call contracts have been provincially identified and assigned to specific tasks in one or more of the regions.    So, basically yes, it at least is stimulating state governments and thousands of private businesses to get their butts moving to get a lot of work done in a short amount of time, and to make certain they have work forces adequate to the tasks to be undertaken.     Much of this has already been done. In fact, you can google each state and see, specifically, the list of infrastructure support projects that have been identified as "shovel ready" and forwarded to the federal government in request for stimulus funding.|`|CVDPXVq0aa	The recovery plan is a mix of both.  It has a lot of money for projects that will put people to work....AND it contains money for people who need help.|`|XJU2nVqxaa	John Kerry is an idiot.   As are the majority of the democratic party.

Of course most black Americans could not help being proud of Barack Obama.  Even 50 years ago, most Americans would have found it inconceivable that a Black man could ever become President of the United States.  Being old enough to remember separate washrooms and routinely hearing adult blacks in a subservient capacity called "girls" and "boys" I find it amazing.      You realize that he could not have won if he were some black panther radical type or rapper, instead of a black man without a heavy accent, who has degrees from Harvard and taught law at University of Chicago.  He also has included a large number of white staffers and cabinet members.  He is in there because his government has little racial identification and has a pretty conventional Democratic Party program and ties.  But as he said "those of you who didn't vote for me - I will be your President too"    If you'd watched the HBO special on John Adams (2nd President) you'd know that Crispius Attucks, died throwing rocks and threatened uniformed British soldiers on guard duty with a club.  The soldiers were acquitted of any wrongdoing in firing upon him and the hundred some terrorists / patriots who accompanied them.  They had no choice.  I have been on both sides in riots and I know that one can only do his duty.  History is another matter.  He was the first black hero of the Revolution.|`|5Ho518J9aa	No, I doubt it.

y1dA3vZ2aa	No they are not and please show us your legitimate proof of this statement.  If he did say that he could have been referring to if his daughters where raped.  Also there is usually more to these bills than what you are reading.  For example, it has been stated that some of these bills were already on the books and that is why he voted against them.  I for one do not like abortions and would never have one but I cannot and will not argue this to a 13 year old girl that was a raped by her father and forced to have a traumatic pregnancy and may not be able to cary it to term safely and she may never have children again.  I think it depends on the situation entirely.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Babies are punishment for the people who don't want to have them.  Some people say that the people who don't want to have them shouldn't have sex.  But let's be realistic.  Who's going to give up sex?  So, forcing a woman to keep her baby when she'd rather not just because she had sex is using that baby to punish the woman.  I single the woman out because the man, although he had a significant contribution, does NOT have to spend the next 20 years of his life raising that child.  The woman, however, does and her life as she knows it ceases to exist.      Obama '08|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	"Babies" are Blessings from God!  This is the most inhumane part of Obama's whole profile!

I am pro life but also pro choice. If a young girl gets raped repeadly and ends up preg.. I think its her right to terminate this preg..or if a family member in her family happens to rape this young girl.. But if a married woman happens to decide she doesnt want to carry a baby I think she should have it and give it up for adoption. It all comes down to the circumstances . To me it would be a painful , dreadful choice to abort a child. But we cant say unless you have been in that girl or woman's shoes. U can say i am divided in this matter.It all boils down to the gov. telling us what we can do or cant do.

I'm not voting for Obama, but he's definitely allowed to have his own opinions on things, just like everyone else in this country.  And, just because you are pro-choice, doesn't mean you love to have an aborting at least 2 times a year.

Secondly, he against requiring CONSENT for teenagers that have been molested.  I suspect you know all this but somehow are for it?  And yes, if you've actually raised a newborn/went through the horror of having your child adopted (my sister did) then yes a baby can be a punishment.

I work with some who feel strongly about this issue and have been told more than once (by these very religious partisans) that pregnancy is and should be God's punishment for premarital sex.  That's the reference.         If you read the transcript of Obama's remarks, he is talking about information about AIDS and pregnancy prevention.  He said that he would not want his daughters to have teen sex, but if they decided to do so (referring to that as a "mistake"), he would want them to know how to use contraception and take measures to prevent STDs.   His quote has been completely taken out of context, and I wish people would stop twisting his words.

This calculated attempt to steal Hillary voters over to McCain has backfired in the worst way.  Not only isn't she helping, she is actually hurting the ticket.    The fact that she can't even attempt to hide her desire for a more "theological" America shows she has neither the temperament nor the presence of mind to handle the position.

Washington Times kicked off Obama plane for finale  The Washington Times  Friday, October 31, 2008    The Washington Times, which has covered the Barack Obama campaign from the start, was kicked off the Democrat's campaign plane for the final 72 hours of the race.    The Obama campaign informed the newspaper Thursday evening of its decision, which came two days after The Times editorial page endorsed Senator John McCain over Mr. Obama. The Times editorial page runs completely independent of the news department.    "This feels like the journalistic equivalent of redistributing the wealth, we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars covering Senator Obama's campaign, traveling on his plane, and taking our turn in the reporter's pool, only to have our seat given away to someone else in the last days of the campaign," said Washington Times Executive Editor John Solomon.

Sarah Palin was selected as the GOP's vice presidential nominee for one reason: John McCain and his advisors believed her nomination would increase his chances at winning the presidential election, to a greater degree than others' nomination.  She is likely to attract votes because she has strengths where the McCain camp finds opportunities: she is young, attractive, fresh (as in, new to Washington politics), energetic, and, yes, female.  Being female allows her to relate to women in ways McCain (and Obama and Biden) never could.  And she's certainly got some attention upon her nomination, because people take notice of new things, like a woman VP candidate (although she is not the first woman to run for the office).    No, she is not an insult to women any more than any politician represents an insult to his or her constituency.  Now THAT'S a real insult: our government, made by and for the people, supposedly consisting of those best suited to govern, spending 10 trillion dollars more than they've received in tax revenue, putting our nation at the mercy of those whom the government owes.  When the public cries out, "Stop spending more than we have," the government does not.  Stop.  Spending.    Sarah Palin is the least of the insults.|`|hJiWqnf5aa	Not to this woman, I love her.

You'd never see a man do that in politics.  McCain's campaign is touting her as an alternative for feminists who were disappointed by Hillary dropping out of the race, but Hillary has a career and experience.  Palin isn't going to appeal to feminists because she relies on her looks or her gender to get ahead rather than actual qualifications.  I would certainly not consider a woman who exploited her appearance in a beauty contest a feminist icon.  I'm not thrilled that the McCain campaign thinks I'll vote for anything wearing a skirt, simply because she's a woman too.  It's insulting the intelligence of women to think that's a good enough reason to vote for or against a candidate.|`|nNBoW74uaa	Of course she is!|`|qdcIcealaa	grow some balls woman!|`|SXeEvt9Qaa	It's an insult to Americans|`|ymCX4zuOaa	Absolutely!

One wink is blindness, one click of the mouth is a hidden disease, yes, one more physical gesture to both that preceed, shall reap and ultimate demise that will cause a horrible spell unspoken to uplift itself and destroy the loved ones of those who committ to the negativity and lies described in this spell.'

mm5p5sy6aa	Semi was introduced back in 07 for the Chey tac.
q9PVawNyaa	Well I'm from the Republic. I'll deal with your points one by one and then give my actual answer:    1: England's university education costs a fortune. Third level is far cheaper in the Republic. England is about 3000 a year and while our fees are going up next year they will still only be 1500 max for an undergraduate course.    2: People in the North of Ireland have dual citizenship and citizenship can't be changed like that. Take Hong Kong for example. Most people there still have dual citizenship.    3: The situation in Ireland was never about religion it was simply Republican versus Loyalist and often this correlated with Catholic versus Protestant but that was actually nothing to do with it.    4: The euro is currently more stable than the pound.    5: Northern Ireland are their own country, they have their own government. The UK is comprised of separate countries.      Either way I think that the North can either stay in the UK or completely break off as its own country. Personally I don't think they could survive economically without it. They cannot join with the Republic for a number of reasons.    1: The Republic cannot support them financially and it would cripple both countries.    2: That course of acion would reignite tensions and probably errupt in more fighting and quite frankly everyone is fed up of that.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	In Britain your university education is not paid for - you have to pay just under 4000 a year in tuition fees, plus another 5000+ on living   costs. So you do have to pay back huge student loans, as you are doing.    But to the question - you would want a unified Ireland for geographical reasons, perhaps, or even because the Euro is worth more than the pound these days. And religion is still exceedingly important in Northern Ireland - more so than you think. The Catholic people of N. Ireland would, many of them at least, rather it was one unified country, like the Liberal Party promised after WW1 - they even wrote the law unifying it, it was just never put into effect.  So religion and economics would play a significant part in some people from N. Ireland wanting to be a part of Eire.|`|6pksPo7Zaa	My friend, you are labouring under a number of misapprehensions.  To begin with, that American lackey Blair did away with free college education.  This is why you now have a predominance of middle class women, rather than working class men, coming into pubic life.  Secondly, from a philosophical point of view, religion is part of the substructure.  It is the economy and class relations which are behind politics.  Thirdly, while the Ulstermen's leaders are in agreement with the peace accord, your average proddy is as bigoted as ever.  You are right, though, in so far as the EU has rendered nationalism an irrelevance. I would draw your attention, though, to the fact that there is unrest breaking out, aimed at foreign workers, so it will be interesting to see whether this cosmopolitanism survives the latest capitalist crisis.|`|iQ70p3nJaa	I think it's to take a stand and prove a point and not follow the rules.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	For the supporters of England, none.  for those that want a united Ireland, everything.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	First off its important to correct you on the basis of the conflict. True, it is religious and around 50% of people living on the island still identify as catholic but are not actively practicing. While the conflict in Northern Ireland began due to a prostestant leaning state and the lack of civil rights given to people who identified as catholic and wished to live in the republic. So in reality the basis hasnt dissappeared.   Also you could argue till we are blue on the face who can lay original claim to the north east part of Ireland. Since there were celts, the normans and other indoeupeans their long before the plantations.   Also if based merely on ethnicity the state has almost and equal proportion of catholics with a much smaller protestant majority than before. By your Logic I could say that the Island or Ireland was actually historically catholic and should belong to the catholics   In fact most of the radical organisations are based on nationalism and Irish/unionist national identity which is only partially based on religion. For example the Irish langauge which has in fact had its biggest resurgence in the North and the identificaion of a new language for people living in Antrim. There is also conflict over the history of the troubles and who an legtimitally claim victimhood.     There is even a very recent conflict surrounding compensation being offered to the families of victims of voilence in the troubles contraversially if these victimes of paramilitary voilence.  .     2) You are right about losing the currency advantage, plus the cost of living is higher in Ireland than it is in the north, there has been a stream of people from dublin to newry, but sometimes, such as just a few years ago this was in reverse. Furthermore people in Northern Ireland were migrate southwards for jobs    3) The UK has educational fees, Ireland does not. Ireland has better pensions too. The UK does however have free healthcare. The UK is definitely not athiest and slightly more culturally progressive in some areas.    4) Dual citizenship has its advantages because of the failing and good things about both countries    5) Ireland has had a higher standard of living and a much higher rate of happiness in recent years according to the economist magazine.    6) The only way this should ever happen inspite of any advantages/disadvantages is if both communities of unionist and catholics both have majority consent. What matters most of all is the rights of the people to self determination as it should in any democracy. I dont think it matters what the state "historically" was.    7)Im sure someone else could tell you more advantages for england tho!    Other points:    If fertility drops with money why is the third world so fertile and why are people from lower socioeconomic groups more fertile.  First off its important to correct you on the basis of the conflict. True, it is religious and around 50% of people living on the island still identify as catholic but are not actively practicing. While the conflict in Northern Ireland began due to a prostestant leaning state and the lack of civil rights given to people who identified as catholic and wished to live in the republic. So in reality the basis hasnt dissappeared.   Also you could argue till we are blue on the face who can lay original claim to the north east part of Ireland. Since there were celts, the normans and other indoeupeans their long before the plantations.   Also if based merely on ethnicity the state has almost and equal proportion of catholics with a much smaller protestant majority than before. By your Logic I could say that the Island or Ireland was actually historically catholic and should belong to the catholics   In fact most of the radical organisations are based on nationalism and Irish/unionist national identity which is only partially based on religion. For example the Irish langauge which has in fact had its biggest resurgence in the North and the identificaion of a new language for people living in Antrim. There is also conflict over the history of the troubles and who an legtimitally claim victimhood.     There is even a very recent conflict surrounding compensation being offered to the families of victims of voilence in the troubles contraversially if these victimes of paramilitary voilence.  .     2) You are right about losing the currency advantage, plus the cost of living is higher in Ireland than it is in the north, there has been a stream of people from dublin to newry, but sometimes, such as just a few years ago this was in reverse. Furthermore people in Northern Ireland were migrate southwards for jobs    3) The UK has educational fees, Ireland does not. Ireland has better pensions too. The UK does however have free healthcare. The UK is definitely not athiest and slightly more culturally progressive in some areas.    4) Dual citizenship has its advantages because of the failing and good things about both countries    5) Ireland has had a higher standard of living and a much higher rate of happiness in recent years according to the economist magazine.    6) The only way this should ever happen inspite of any advantages/disadvantages is if both communities of unionist and catholics both have majority consent. What matters most of all is the rights of the people to self determination as it should in any democracy. I dont think it matters what the state "historically" was.    7)Im sure someone else could tell you more advantages for england tho!    Other points:    If fertility drops with money why is the third world so fertile and why are people from lower socioeconomic groups more fertile.    Further Points:    a) You may not declare that religion is the only thing of significance but you clearly rely on it to try and say that secte

He was criticizing the conflicting and incompatible accounting systems used by the various DOD agencies.    Here is an example of what the problem is:  Department A buys an asset and transfers it to Department B.  Department A uses a five year depreciation on that asset while Department B uses a 3 year depreciation.  At the end of 3 years Department A is reporting that the asset retains 40% of its value while Department B is reporting that the item has no remaining value.    The asset is still there but the disagreement as to the remaining value of the asset creates the appearance that the money has gone 'missing.'
f8bT9JRaaa	If you substituted "kidnap and torture" for extraordinary rendition more people might understand what it's about.  I don't believe any First world countries except Israel and the U.S. are party to rendering suspects.    If you're not going to torture a "suspect, at best", why do you need to put a diaper on them, wrap them up like a baloney, and transport them secretly (i.e. no habeas corpus) to a country that has an abysmal human rights record?  Why don't you just invite the Oman, or whoever, to go have a cup of coffee with you and ask him your questions in a civil way?  After all the military are finding this this approach is more effective -- but there are too many people who don't want to let the facts get in their way.

6EB2JDFmaa	Clearly obama lost that one! I do not see the difference between the two except for drilling offshore which obama is not for.    McCain is a little stronger for nuclear power than obama, but realistically, without other measures to bring in home made energy besides ethanol, we have to rely on something other than foreign oil.   I agree with McCain that we as Americans can get it done within 7 years and that will scare the pants off of OPEC.     We need the independence and the jobs or we will fail.    |`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I think that's clearly Obama's advantage.    The big problem with McCain is that he says we can build 45 new nuclear power plants in no time.  But nuclear power plants cost $8 billion apiece - too much to be privately funded.  So he's requiring the federal government to put up $300 billion, yet he's also proposing a spending freeze.  Those are directly conflicting positions.  McCain also pays lip service to renewable energy but consistently votes against it.    I think Obama missed opportunities by not making these points.  Nevertheless, Obama's energy plan is much stronger than McCain's, and Obama articulated it well.  Obama pointed out that oil can't solve our problems and we need to invest in renewable energy.  Which we can't do if there's a spending freeze.|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	When McCain say's we'll be off Middle Eastern or Venezuelan oil in 4 years, that was funny.

Plus it has already been proven that it will take 10 years to see a drop of in Nationally drilled oil.    Obama on the other hand was completely realistic.|`|gTpOTYFvaa	McCain isn't realistic at all.

Now he says he will do all those things.........questionable at best. While we have *only* 3% of the oil in this world, we still have more oil than Saudi Arabia. Obama will force us to keep our dependence on foreign oil and McCain will cut it by 3/4. As far as nuclear power, it is the safest (no accidents in the last 30 years at any nuclear plant) and one of the cleanest, with the exception of wind and solar. Clean coal is also one of our most viable sources of energy but the environmentalists do not want to "rape" the land. It can be extracted without doing this and should not be taken off the table.    I think McCain has much better plans for our energy sources by utilizing all of them and not just some. |`|qnEOkqEOaa	Obama definitely energized me!|`|AA11967042	I really liked Obama's plan - why should we waste money and expect "oil" from other countries when we can be doing it ourselves... ???

dTaBXqjyaa	It is all complicated. There is no really exact set years for degress in murder. 1st degree murder is life, life does not mean life in prison, it means 25 years. second degree might get you a few years less, third degree is manslaughter where you did not intend to kill someone but it happened. It is really complicated I used to really be into stuff like this with the law, im sure if you search the web on google you can find a lot more about it. By the way, some minors are considered adults when they commit murder so they could get the same sentence as an adult who is 18 and older.

Some people will never figure it out.  It's so dumb to think one man can change that.  Most people who hate Obama will do it because he is only half white, not 100% white.  It will have nothing to do with the job he does.  Also dumb.  Or they will hate him because he cannot keep the promises he made to get elected.  THAT is the one that makes the most sense, but all politicians do that.

yoytdRGTaa	Is the address on your voter registration the same as where you currently live?    Yes, you go to the polling place that is designated for your precinct.  It's possible that you and your aunt live far enough from each other, even though on the same street, that you fall into different precincts.  Odds are, however, that you'll still go to the same polling place (each one usually handles several precincts), but get into different lines once there.    There is no segregation between parties.  Being registered as one party or another usually only comes into play during the party primaries (to keep people from voting both FOR the person in their party they want to win the nomination, and FOR the person in the other party that they think will provide the weakest competition).|`|Wt7Eovo9aa	I'm not sure, but make sure you vote for McCain / Palin    check out these videos     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppQszYT3d...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pshn25A...|`|lWZi2p70aa	You vote at the registered precinct or you vote a question ballot.

I think the biggest difference is the density of the population. Even in the US gun control has a rural vs urban feel. Country folk who use guns as tools, and experience little crime don't understand the fuss. City people can't comprehend anyone needing a gun. These two groups will never agree. The US is still largely rural, with isolated urban centers.    Pick a country and do a google search.     Any urban country with dense populations will have strict gun control (Japan), rural countries with lots of wide open spaces will have little gun control (USA). Most fall somewhere in between (Canada, UK, etc.)    Obviously the type of government has an effect. No other country acknowledges the individual's god given right to keep and bear arms. The founding fathers were very clear on this point. The people, not the government, were responsible for their protection.

I mean lets face it "War" is a boys game and its still hard for them to play with women. You're also right its not fair but life often isn't.|`|1nEjLRRNaa	not many woman severed in the wars of the past due to their weak bodies|`|FraTtrjVaa	I don't understand how 33 out of 4,881 (to date) is very significant at all. That would mean that women represent .007% of the total amount of  US deaths in Iraq and Afganistan. As far as granting parity for women to be allowed in combat arms units such as Infantry, Cav, SF, and others, thats simply not a practical idea. IT has absolutely nothing to do with women not being strong enough, tough enough, or in any other ways capable of doing the job (which I'm sure many of them out there can). It has to do with human instinct, emotion, and dynamics. The army already has a HUGE issue with sexual harrassment, EO, and other issues affecting unit readiness and team cohesion with units, especially combat arms units, that have women integrated into them. Though many women are fully capable of these jobs, its just not worth the S*** storm that comes when you integrate a few women into a company or platoon full of dudes. Its human nature.|`|22tPNksKaa	That is a good, nay, great question.    I think the reason is, perhaps, "out of sight out of mind". If women aren't honored often, then the public is less likely to debate their role in the service. And as well ALL know, the Government hates controversy & debating more than anything.    There ARE roles in combat where women are uniquely suited. It has been said women are better at multitasking, which is one reason they excel at aerial combat. They do very well at sniping. Since they are usually smaller, they can function better in confined spaces like Tanks & APCs/IFVs. And finally, they are uniquely skilled at assassination.     It is significant that Japanese Ninja had many female members for such purposes. In WW 2 the Soviets killed hundreds of German & other Axis officers w/ female NKVD & GRU assassins. And the Cold War Spetznaz had large numbers of female members to operate behind enemy lines.    I apologize if I sound sexist, I was only mentioning areas where they were exceptionally useful in a war. And isn't winning the war all that matters?    Of course the reason most people are uncomfortable discussing women in combat is because of a unique risk involved in their being captured. And considering the types of enemy we frequently encounter, this risk is magnified.    And finally, I read something by the renowned historian Liddell Hart. He had interviewed a German commander who led the charge in the Battle of the Bulge. The following is exactly what was said: "at this vital moment he dallied with a young American nurse, 'blonde and beautiful', who held him spellbound in a village his troops had overrun." B.H. Liddell Hart, History of the Second World War, Chapter 35, bottom of page 651.    Was that nurse ever given a medal? She stopped a division single-handedly.    RE: GOP 2.0 thanks for the links.

Gezfmghuaa	Wow - I don't usually recommend this on here (you can check!) but in this case you really need to consult an attorney, at least that's my suggestion.    There are a number of factors here, namely why the divorce is not final, the terms of the trust, and the terms of the IRA.  Someone with experience in these matters needs to review the actual documents, as this could have significant tax implications as well.
W9kDyyjFaa	TAX. That all .TAX. If the common people could use and enjoy herb as in Holland for example, and less alcohol then taxes taken from drink would tumble massively. If a government are so concerned about health etc. then why aren't cigarettes illegal ? TAX. Guaranteed revenue from somethin' people crave once them usin it. Who ever crave herb ? Not I, but use it when I choose. If you use home grown herb in tea, ingested, or in a pipe as I do then no tobacco involved which is the tax free way. All proceed go toward the growing and nuturing of good herb. You are right that the modifications and hydro methods are bad, for all the reasons which are obvious. That's typical of how prohibition ties itself up in senseless contradiction. These laws and m.p's will never ever ever stop the use of herb. Impossible. By making it illegal just increases the adverse market and the worsening of quality with destructive additives.The whole sacred ethic of herb is that it stand alone and prevail against all effort to stop it. By the way many 'respectable doctors' make big dollar by flippant issuing of prescription for crazy junk like prozac and other psycho addictive and dependency forming drugs, a huge and profitable market them involved in. The way to anti depression is to seek out the underlying causes not blot out the symptoms with chemicals. To me, it seems that being happy in UK unless you pay tax for it is deemed to be illegal. That itself would enhance depression man.|`|AA11590427	You have some valid points. I am from Holland, where it is semi-legal. The upside of this is that it is much more regulated here, and within Holland the criminality related to marijuana is not that high. We do have problems with people from other countries coming in and exporting it. The quality is pretty good here, and the chance of buying 'laced' of 'spiked' pot is small (in coffee shops).  Also, because you are allowed a certain amount of pot it's not such a mystery for adolescents. It's actually pretty uncool to smoke a lot of weed in high school.  However, it being semi-legal has its downsides as well. A lot of people underestimate the effects. Especially tourists coming to Amsterdam smoke way too much (i guess they feel it's now or never) and we have to deal with the consequences. Also, as someone above me already said, driving while smoking pot is extremely dangerous (and illegal). I don't know if legalizing it would influence that, though.    I never smoke pot, by the way, it's really not my thing, but I do see a lot of it around me because I live in Amsterdam. I think this is an interesting discussion, but one without a clear answer one way or the other.    For more info on 'our' policy :     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy...    love|`|XWuvaxGNaa	hmm, you have a few points there.

No politician has the courage to say yes to mj because they would be jumped on as just generally pro-drug. Drugs are a divisive and emotive issue, too many people get messed up for them ever to be OK. We can thank our dumb celebrities for a lot of that. Being busted for mj didn't do Robert Mitchum any harm when everyone thought it would be a career killer.    I love a good toke but think the new strains are really dangerous. As a smoker it is your responsibility to smoke what you can handle. I think there are clear links between skunk and mental illness. So I suppose that makes me anti to an extent.  Stoned drivers are dangerous, so again that makes me anti.  The chain seems to be fact, the escalation onto harder drugs, though as a user it had no impact on  me. I tried and dumped harder stuff, a lot of people I know didn't or couldn't. So again that makes me anti.  On the whole I think it should stay as it is, except I do believe leaving drug organisation to the crims is even worse than all of the above. It is a dilemma.|`|DSp8azw7aa	People back in the sixties though it was a mistake when they decided to make marijuana illegal, that debate has going on for years.   Since after the war and that happened in the 1920's and 30's, the prohibition years.    History repeats itself.   Back in 1980, down in Florida they had been spraying marijuana fields with poison to destroy the weed, that was criminal really because it doesn't really hurt anyone.     Now all these grow-ops we have all over the place, marijuana being grown in houses it has become a big problem.   It takes a lot of electricity to grow and does a lot of damage, causes fires and so on.    I think that marijuana had more to with freedom of expression, and anti establishment and the younger generation and the hippie movement trying to shock the older generation, rebelling against their parents, anti Vietnam War and all that jazz.

I'd be fine if it was to help fix the deficit, or tool our military, or even finance a better education system. But it's not! The only stated purpose of the tax increase on my bracket, is to pay for a tax decrease on theirs.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Meanwhile 2/3rd's of corporations don't pay taxes and their sending your jobs to China - Tax breaks under Bush for the last 8 years, are Americans better off then 8 years ago?

She makes her rent and more with the Obama tax cut    The client is happy with a great looking newly decorated house.  His wife is extremely happ, feeling it was money well spent.    No one is complaining, except Republicans.    That's how I see this scenario playing out.|`|xrKZ5T8Naa	They are rich.They can afford it.Why don't the Mccain supporters realize that republicans only care about the rich.Why do you want to suffer more,because of some ridiculous idea that if you throw money at rich people,the poor,and middle-class will benefit.So what,Nina"s clients make more than $250,000,and that means they can afford it.Oh yeah,and Nina will get a tax cut.|`|vEnmF72Xaa	Obama supporters will scrape through the internet and try and prove you wrong, it's a shame not many of them have brains nor think for themselves.|`|5HR0E8kFaa	It didn't seem to hurt them when they paid the same tax rate in the 90's.

Also, very few people actually have capital gains at this point, so worrying about that seems out of touch.|`|IQxpItxGaa	Listen, I make well over $250,000 a year and I think I should be taxed more.    This is a simple concept. It doesn't take a genious to figure this out! If I pay more taxes, the middle class benefit. The middle class are my clients. If they have more money, they spend more, they help the economy, the whole of the economy benefits, and I become richer.    Here's my point: Under Bill Clinton, I paid a hell of a lot more taxes, but the middle class was strong and the economy was strong and I was a hell of a lot richer. Under Bush, I paid very little tax, and I'm posted my worst financial earnings ever.    Again, Simple concept. The Middle class RUNS our economy, they run ANY capitalist economy. If the middle class suffers, everybody suffers.    I am rich, and I want to pay more taxes to help the middle class cuz in the end, if the middle class is doing well, I will be even richer.  |`|Tu9lr9BMaa	People can't be made to think that much into anything on their own.

Additionally, the larger tax rebates that would be issued will go to people who currently do not earn enough money to receive a rebate, or do not pay taxes at all.   The middle class families will now be considered "rich" and be taxed, only to give the poorer class the rebate, while they receive no rebate.    Seems like a plan. Not.     BUT:::    You still have time to rethink, reeducate yourselves and vote the right way!! McCain/Palin!!    EDIT:     I wonder if these Democrats were "rich", millionaires maybe.....hmmmm.  Would they then think it's ok and "fair" to be taxed more just because they have more money than the poorer citizen???    I'll break it down Barney Style for you and give you Democrats/Obama supporters another example:    Bill Gates was a high school drop-out, just like many other Americans. BUT: he did not end up working at McDonalds forever just "getting by". NO! He worked his azz off and created an empire single handed for his children.   Is it fair now to say to him that he owes the rest of us??? Heck no.   That's his hard work, sweat and tears he poured into that company! I wasn't there next to him, were any of you?   Why, why, why, WHY should the rest of America EXPECT to get his money and hike his taxes while we sit here crying and feeling sorry for ourselves because we aren't Bill Gates???    Think about what you all are saying!   You all are blind if you can't reason with this.   You are suffering. So......Go bust your own azz and change your future.....don't expect Bill Gates or any other rich people to help you out just because you're not willing to do it yourself.|`|0SItljvYaa	Why are YOU asking this question?

The difference is that small business and micro business and their revenues should be taxed accordingly...You make more, you pay more...NO FREE RIDES...Business people rely on infrastructure and other people's labor to create their product or service....STOP BEING GREEDY and PAY!  |`|w8XOaYaXaa	Sounds like Nina might have to find another job, a lot of people drive pizzas if they have to|`|ExCAedp4aa	You mean like in the 90s when we saw all those job losses and a terrible economy?

He wants to make people depend on the gov't and i think he wants to rule not serve. If you redistribute wealth, the wealthy will start to leave our country and the ones who aren't wealthy enough to leave will be sheep at the mercy of a government for food. He will destroy the free market nd that's his goal! He wants all the wealth at his finger tips. He wants to govern us so fully that he will undermine the foundation our fore fathers fought to give us. Socialism gives rise to totalitarian dictatorships! Beware!!!!!!!! ACORN has been registering all the McDonalds employees. Those people who were too lazy to vote see the opportunity to profit from Obama. They don't want to work. They want money for nothing but this is a short sighted vision. In the long run it will really hurt us. When b/c the rich leave there are no jobs everyone will be at the mercy of the government! Our liberty itself is at stake!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VOTE MCCAIN!|`|4qDO9ENGaa	sweetie we have been hurting, wake up, and mccaine taxing health care is better!!!!|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Ask yourself this: After 8 years of trickle down economy how has that helped anyone except the rich? When you have the middle class paying 33 cents of every dollar earned in taxes, while the rich pay 18 cents of every dollar earned in taxes? You don't see how that effects the middle class when expenses sky rocket for fuel and food? When the rich take that tax break and invest in overseas markets instead of the U.S.A. and the middle class loses their jobs to outsourcing overseas the government loses a hunk of its income too. The middle class is smaller and smaller. By ending the unequal and unfair tax breaks and giving more back to the middle class, the middle class will not invest overseas. They will live, work, and buy right here, thereby stimulating the economy here.  The claim that "Obama's appealling to the poorest people who are uneducated and don't have a clue " is something I resent as a supporter. I have an A.A. Degree and a B.S. Degree. I was "Middle Class" but am on the verge of becoming poor thanks to having been laid off of a 15 year job working for a Church School that went out of business. Laid off parents could no longer afford to send their children for a "better then" public education.|`|AA12152549	Well, then, Nina should sit down with the clients and draw up a plan which the clients can realistically afford and through which Nina can make some money. |`|9d24eebc65f160389e6cd993dc745cd8aa	The increased tax cut "Nina" gets from Obama Vs. McCain is a HUGE percentage of her salary.    Also, are you trying to convince me that "people who make over $250,000 a year" are right on the cusp? Do you realize that $250,000 a year is the point at which he STARTS raising taxes? Starts. Trust me; the people who face siginificant tax increases are not pinching pennies to decide if they can afford the maid.    A maid! Jesus. Get real.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	He does not propose increasing them BY 39.5 percent, he is proposing increasing them TO 39 or 39.5 percent.    So, not an additional 39.5 percent -- just up to 39.5 percent.

20e67a751121ab0791980b62bc2f934aaa	I will assume that you have a specific clause in your tenant's lease that she is not allowed to smoke in the apartment.    As far as proving this for purposes of eviction, it's very hard to do. You could install a cigarette smoke detector in the unit, which you may be allowed to do depending on the laws of your state/local jurisdiction, but I'm unsure you want to incur the expense involved. Then, when the detector is triggered, you can move forward with an eviction.    You can find cigarette smoke detectors on the Web, for example at www.cigarettesmokedetector.com.    Personally, I would wait until the tenant's lease was up, then refuse to extend the lease, rather than spend several hundreds of dollars to install a detector, then another several hundreds of dollars (at the minimum) to effect an eviction.|`|oRYvebd4aa	First and foremost - it must be written into the lease that it is a no smoking apartment.

But to look at it this way taking his middle name "hussein". People do have a fear of the name. That is why more radical McCain supporters used it. It was to instill fear in the voter because of its org ins. But what was a defining moment in our recent history was we did not fear a man because of a name he was born with. We ignored the fear that was instilled upon us for control and we stood up and said no more. So in closing I can not predict the outcome of our new presidents first term and if he does well a second, but I can say that in this past election we have seen a unification among Americans that has been absent in our nation for quite sometime, and President Barrack Hussein Obama had brought that unity.|`|utQrtdxiaa	It's not because he's "black" which by the way, he's white and black.

BrjZhySIaa	Depression brought on by hyperinflation.      Unless the govt intervenes again and prints more money to prop up the failed system to further prolong the inevitable.    Can you say Weimar Republic?      @Ritchwilliams:  Good point.  Any cancellation of debt is considered an Act of War.  And if China were to claim their debt, we would have to surrender some valuable assets.  And if our govt refuses, well, let's hope the Dems don't touch the 2nd amendment; we may need it like never before.     @Jimmy: I hope you can make yourself available in 2 years so we can revisit the matter.  Being educated as you claim, you can't possibly think that increasing the money supply this quickly will have a subtle impact on the economy...  Ever heard of Operation Bernhard? If not, google it.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Obama better hope it works    He admitted this morning that if he does not fix the economy in three years he has no chance of being re elected|`|AU70o6wTaa	worse!|`|44IT2kmNaa	  My thought: picture today, but with $1,200 gold and $2 cans of Goya beans.  >>  Yes, but your also the type that would have thought if bush's budgets were passed year after year the economy would look a lot better than it does now. So your knowledge of the economy is very obviously limited so why don't you go do what the "liberals" of this country have done and go take some college courses on the subject.    To answer your question, its certainly not the cure all. Our economy will struggle but this will help it. We will probably be out of the recession in 2 years and starting into recovery.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Well, that and the U.S. being MORE than a trillion dollars in debt since we'll have to be paying China for the interest on their loan.

Unless voting law in your state specifies "Driver's license" (which it should not, since some people are eligible to vote but don't drive), a passport should be a valid photo ID.  In some states (like Texas), you can use your voter registration card instead.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	 I can tell you the rules in Canada      A passport is good - and can be used to identify you as a citizen -      But proof of address must also accompany the passport.     This is to ensure that people don't vote in the wrong area -- |`|AA11598520	I can't say for sure, but I would think you must be. A passport has a photo and is proof of citizenship.

That is just more BS the liberal media is feeding you, and you are eating it up.|`|TsTndkp7aa	Anonymous sources.  You have to love the media's attack pieces.

HR3010 -    VOTED NO - To increase appropriations for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program by $1,276,000,000    He doesn't care about you...McCain on the other hand, loves this country and will do everything possible to make it better for us.    He is hiring T. Boone Pickens, didn't ya know?    |`|CwlZNMGyaa	So What? Nuclear Power Plants are extremely safe now, probably safer than that electric or hydrogen power car that's for sure. BTW, Chernobyl happened in the Asian continent not in the US. Solar power and wind power cannot provide enough energy for a larger city, might work for small towns, but that's about it. You'd have to build millions of fans just to power a city like LA. Besides, McCain won't need to do much about gasoline as that has been going down by itself recently. What we should be doing is drilling for our own, but some politicians, namely Democrats keep it from happening. 
NMaCcyeKaa	The waste products from the nuclear plants he's proposing to build?  Maybe he'll negotiate a deal with Iraq to take it off our hands.  They have stretches of open desert where safe storage facilities can be built, and we've already left a lot of nuclear waste there lying around in the form of depleted uranium bullets.|`|AA11268185	I can't believe he said nuclear naval vessels are proven safe.

These people messed up once and then were handed $85 billion dollars.  Do you really think they learned a lesson?  One of their executives received $20 million of that $85 billion.  I wish I could do a crappy job at work and still get $20 million.

Someone needs to say, all Americans count!|`|eluInD1Aaa	A Rep congress woman called on the Media (Fox and CNN) to investigate all Dem's calling them Anti American.  I believe that the Rep's did that during the late 40's and early 50's.|`|dh8QUfywaa	Honestly, both responses lack sincerity.  Palin seems to have a hard time putting sentences and complete thoughts together and Biden loves the camera a little too much.  He likes to perform rather than be a regular person.    I think they are both terrible responses.  Biden wins because the world is Demanding Obama for President!  Enough is enough.|`|117ba8dee6d7175b6b3f5e2480ad6007aa	Definitely Biden. I was rooting for McCain before he picked Palin for a running mate - he made the worst possible choice.|`|b689f9ac8f7b4f1616c358f09467668daa	McCain had a shot at winning this upcoming election. He lost that last ray of hope by who he chose as his running mate.  If something happend to McCain do you really want that airhead attempting to run the country???  She's a good politican, don't get me wrong.  But a vice president is supposed to be somebody who can step up in crisis and take control.  Alaska,,,,,, country,,,,,.  Biden, not the best "well" spoken person either, but if something happend to Obama, I could see him leading us.  |`|NKwfOk3Eaa	Palin, I don't even have to read it. Biden never does anything but lie all the time!|`|AA11684340	Biden~because he appears to be trying to unite the country instead of pull it apart! We can either stand together or fall apart, which is what I believe Mc Cain will continue to do to this once great nation. Every candidate has problems, its just we have to decide if we want 12 years of the same bullsh!t, or see what someone under the age of 100 has to offer.    Ok the age thing was low, but it appears he is living in the past. He only choose that woman as a mate because look at the publicity that is getting!|`|hz2nFhVEaa	Biden is so awesome!!  |`|AMYXuD2Caa	Biden said it is patriotic to pay more taxes.

Yep, smart guy.|`|unLISuSaaa	biden. i swear palin is on crack or never completed high school|`|NwJK3WAZaa	biden|`|nzpg9jxpaa	I think, what palin was talking about, was separating the areas of the country where socialism does well from those where it does very poorly.    I do not want to give a dime of my hard earned money to people who have not earned a dime.    Period.    If I wish to donate to charity, I will, but it is not the governments position to redistribute the wealth-- and thats the obama biden plan.    Im not interested in it, I don't want it, and I refuse to partake in it.    And, i WOULD go so far as to call socialism unamerican, even though our country and its leaders has embraced the concept we fought against for seven decades.|`|6mwtZ20Kaa	I never said a democrat doesn't support america. Biden as well as obama are great speakers. Just cause someone isn't the greatest of a speaker does not mean they should not run our country!|`|XjcjCtxvaa	biden|`|6oZpZ3Btaa	Did Biden say that before or after they decided to cut the national anthem out of the rally program for time reasons?|`|sEQpTml2aa	I agree with Senator Obama, because he can do no wrong.  Don't you'all just love me.|`|59JS5lnhaa	Um, I think, um, Palin has contracted, um, mad moose disease.|`|ycj8NdoYaa	Biden.  This is a no brainer.  I bet Palin could get this one right.|`|UkJ4r9jwaa	That woman is a insult to good republican woman. |`|oczR2yTxaa	The problem with Palin's idea of patriotism is that it requires you to fear and hate everything non-American with a religious fervor and to shout down even the merest hint that things could be improved on. It insists on absolute obedience in it's disciples and any dissent whatsoever is considered heresy worthy of excommunication.    Like any philosophy that insists that their way is right and all others are wrong, it is inherently intolerant and will always lead to division.    Obama and Biden, along with most enlightened people, know that it's possible to love your country without necessarily believing that it is perfect or that every other country or philosophy is evil. They know that there is nothing wrong with looking at your country with an objective eye and working to make things better.    It's a concept that people like Palin just don't seem to be able to grasp. Hers is a philosophy that fosters xenophobia, fear, division and hate and, as history shows, whenever it is allowed to dominate for more than a short while, it always ends in disaster (often a war).    TV|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Biden     I didn't even have to read it.    If it said Palin, then Biden wins by default.|`|78c8fa42f10a6b4d6fa9d689c34f530daa	United We Stand, Divided We Fall    Thank God for America.      And you can sign me as being one of those damned, liberal, educated city folk who actually wish the Republicans would campaign on issues that matter instead of extremism and division.     In my view, the person who uses our precious gift of free speech and democracy to spread lies and division is the one who is un American and unPatriotic.  |`|sdvJXMRqaa	Palin is shameful !   Obama seeks to unite. McCAin and his supporters seek to divide. Those who love America support national unity.  |`|f4doqdSCaa	I think, or at least hope, that what Biden says is true, that we ALL love America. McCain supporters will, however, say that Obama supporters do not love America, which I find interesting. More contradictions.|`|Vh9CbtLUaa	They both acknowledged that the people who show up are super patriotic, the area has many patriots.  What is wrong, must every incidental be picked apart to diminish or try to diminish a candidate.  Each of them said a truth, each of them had more important things to say and be reported on.  Biden was right we are one nation under God, Palin was right we are patriotic. Amen  Vote any way you please but vote.|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	i don't even listen to what palin says anymore. it makes me laugh too hard all the while sending a shiver of disgust and horror down my spine.

She wouldn't make it past the Republican primaries.

His comments about Obama are utterly baffling.|`|fh12fkNWaa	No because if they won she'd be in the president's sooner than 2012. He's 72 year old!

GoRFRY2naa	I hope it shows that she has been covering up and lying, that she ordered that man to fire her ex brother-in-law, that he refused and that she then fired him, that she abused her power and that this has been a dirty little secret among the Alaska legislature, and that she is shown to be dangerously right wing and ultra religious to the extent that her sanity comes into question.    In short, I hope they hang her out to dry by her short skirt, one of her pointy heels stuck up her lying as s.    Lady Morgana  OBAMA IN '08|`|R8GQZCInaa	Unfortunately, it probably won't say anything after the First Thug, Todd Palin, closed everyone's mouths in Alaska. I get the feeling from the ones brave enough to talk in Alaska that this man is the arctic north's answer to Tony Soprano. Bullying and bribing his way through politics with his wife. If those in the know were honest and talking we might learn a whole lot about Boris and Natasha Palin.|`|Y2REz1LMaa	I think the truth will not be displayed |`|2459e32a987a49305280c9a12e43c44caa	I hope the truth otherwise McCain's camp wouldn't be so eager to issue their own pre-emptive report.

I am not sure if they will be punished though.|`|k4Xg3pI3aa	I think Dynaflow's a bit touched. It was not an Obama-sponsored event. It predated Palin's nom. It's also loaded with Repubs.

When everyone is listening, they don't talk about anything, then behind America's back they are lying, and smearing all over the land. None of this is going to help them. Might as well pack it up and say goodnight. Wake up the next day to Obama as the president.|`|UFE7BJHBaa	Yes, in fact, the last 3 or 4 days proved to me 2 things.  RACISM IS ALIVE & WELL IN THE USA.......and     WITH ALL THAT BOTTLED HATE IN THE McCAIN CAMPAIGN, AND IN THE GOP AS WELL,  IT ONLY STRENGTHENS MY ORIGINAL BELIEFS THAT THE GOP WERE BEHIND THE MURDERS OF JFK, RFK, AND MLK    " JOHN McCAIN IS A RACIST PIG "|`|lMKeNEKgaa	Educate yourself please. Not all republicans hate. Some of you democrats are just silly. Look, you guys are rating comments poorly just because they don't agree with you; that is ignorance and hate in itself. While I do not agree with many of the points of McCain and Palin (and how they run their campaign), I am unbiased enough to see that Obama isn't that great either.    "The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened." - Norman Thomas, U.S. Socialist Party presidential candidate 1940, 1944 and 1948    I am afraid Obama may be TOO radical, and this change crap is such a facade; it is rather impossible to go through with all his ambitious plans, and he hasn't given any thorough/thought out plans on how he can fund them either.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	The Republicans seem to be running a particularly nasty campaign which Obama reluctantly has to respond to.  I don't understand what has happened to people.  It used to be that everyone respected that people had the right to differing opinions without being vilified for it.  Calling each other names has become common.  I've come to the conclusion that people who do that aren't very intelligent; they don't seem to be able to give sane and thoughtful reasons for their beliefs but rather rant and rave.|`|0a78e11c60dc1aa5ae0fc490736a46a9aa	I don't want to be together with people that want me to give them foodstamps, a free house, and free health care.

It's an attempt to educate the people that are blinded by Barack Soetoro's vague "Change" claim.      Another thing.  You don't bring the country together.  It's not designed that way.  Read the Federalist Papers.  Read the dissents in Sawyer v. Youngstown Sheet and Tube.     If there is no opposition, no one is watching the guy with his hand in the cookie jar.

He needs to fire all his hateful and intolerant advisers telling him to play dirty.  He should praise Obama as a decent man and condemn those who are racist and propagate lies about his religion and nationality.    Then McCain should come clean and say he will work as hard, or harder than Obama, to turn around the economy.    I am not voting for him, but I do want him to at least be a honorable candidate. If he is going to lose, lose with honor and dignity.  For once in his life, he should stand tall and show the nation that a man can lose an election but not lose his dignity.

I like the way N. European countries don't think it's the government's business to dictate "morality" based on some fanatic religious beliefs.  But in the end they have as much morality as we have, and people's "immorality" that doesn't hurt others is ignored.     I wish there were an affordable option for those without health insurance to get it, and I really think it could turn out less expensive than we think. We already have to eat the bills of all the uninsured who show up at the ER.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.    However, it's easier to open a business in the USA than in many (but not all) Euro countries, and businesses usually try to please customers, whereas in Europe, if you don't like it, it doesn't help much to complain.

All of the women I worked with on her campaign here in Indiana have come together to work on Obama's campaign.  ONE of the over 100 women I worked with in the primaries is a PUMA.

Besides, Hillary sent me to the Obama camp.|`|PKqxe9Tiaa	You can randomly take two people and find many points they actually agree on no matter how different their views are overall if you look hard enough.  I'm sure David Duke and Louis Farrakhan have similar views on jews but i doubt the Nation of Islam will be supporting David if he runs for president again.    The bottom line is that Mccain/Palin (especially Palin) differ dramatically on too many key issues to persuade Hillary voters to support them.  The only reason a Hillary voter would ponder it is the gender issue and that's a pretty hard sell considering Palin is the opposite of Hillary on many women's issues.     They are drastically different on most issues concerning health care and the economy in general.  Aside from cherrypicking (like you did in this question), you are not going to convince many Hillary supporters that trickle down economics is the way to go and that is what the Mccain/ Palin ticket is trying to sell.  |`|RH8Ncf36aa	If they did this country would have a serious problem.

Sorry to tell you this but its time for the america we remember to return.

NOBAMA!|`|3DQYjddeaa	I don't think he will bring it up. McCain has too much class. As far as the Keating 5 goes.

Good luck to them both.  Mccain still has some honor and dignity afterall.

Just the same way he looked at his speech last week, when:  - He had to take the microphone off an old lady that said that Obama was an arab and Mccain had to correct her, and tell her that Obama is a decent family man in which he only disagrees on fundamental issues.  - Someone from the public asked: How can I raise my child under a terrorist president such as Obama, and MCCAIN had to say: We must take this campaign with respect, Obama is a decent family man, and is someone you should not be afraid of as a president. He was boohooed after wards by his own crowd for telling them the truth. People don't want the truth, they want to listen to terrorism lies and deceit, that's why he was boohooed.|`|0KFGVrYuaa	I don't care about Ayer. I have already made up my mind about it.

Here is the word the McCainites don't understand. TEMPORARILY. You put 30,000 extra police in New York City and violence will drop to nothing. Put 30,000 armed soldiers anywhere and the same will happen. Duh.|`|5cLZlX30aa	No progress in Iraq?  Tell the soldiers that, Ms. Hilton.

McCain&Palin '08|`|844DGAMmaa	To be honest, neither one.     Obama didn't "wow" me today, and McCain was too busy trying to undermind Obama. |`|ShhOXGuQaa	McCain did better than the other debates...obviously..he projected himself much better..he seemed sharper and firmer than the previous debates..Obama was on the ropes all night, he almost seemed to be ashamed of himself..|`|h3vkprXkaa	Clearly the answer is Senator Obama.

MCain Said his affilitation was the biggest mistake of his career, and that was in 1980's.  He has done a beautiful job since then.  And he hasn't lied about it or covered it up like Barry has.

f3531b6f54158276ac57573d3f499ebdaa	The FBI is investigating 26 companies and indicted two brokers from Bear Stearns and two from Credit Suisse. More indictments are to come.     Most of the action is happening at state level. California, Illinois, and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in particular have already extracted close to 100 billion in settlements and fines from JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Wachovia, Countrywide, and many others. I'm pretty sure most of that will go towards homeowner relief.|`|96zZlJVYaa	that should be easy, you and me and those who got over their head and the rest of the american people. |`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	Everyone, except the excessively rich|`|RQzZqrZQaa	We are.

Fuld, um.. Sullivan, and uh McImtnlet or something.  They brought them in to testify under oath as to why their companies stole all the worlds money, then failed, and then the top guys closed up shop and kept millions for themselves and left their stock holders and everyone down the line that depended on loans and other financial connections out to dry.  So they got yelled at.  One woman congresswoman said today "Shame on you, Mr Sullivan"  just like thats all she said.  HAHAAHA! that was funny.  so basically the bad guys that came to power and raped our economy under Bush are closing up all their loose ties and walking away with all the takings before Obama takes power.  They wont go to jail for the same reason Bush and Cheney weren't impeached.

For today: Go McCain/Palin 2008!  They will make a great team.     Obama is a total farce who isn't who he says he is. He works for an organization called ACORN which is as corrupt as they come.     He promises change, but the change he promises is not what his "followers" are going to like--unless of course they like socialism.  Check him out. He isn't a "Christian" like he claims. His church with Jeremiah Wright believes totally different than the Christian belief. They follow James Cone Theology. Look it up if you don't believe me. It's a black supremacist church. "If God doesn't believe that blacks are superior to whites, we should kill Him." That's just one of the off the wall statements they make on there.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	No.  In my state, if a woman has two drinks then consents to have sex with a sober man, the man can be charged with rape because the woman may not have been able to make an informed decision.  I would not support the death penalty for the man even though he committed rape.    Yet if a man got angry with a woman, he could beat her and literally rip the skin off her face yet not receive the death penalty because it wasn't murder or rape.  Yes, I had a girlfriend that this happened to.  The man got three months in prison and she was severely scarred for life.    Even some of our current laws don't make much sense to me.  The man in my first example may be identified as a sex offender and wouldn't be allowed to live within 1000 feet of a school and need to register every three months with the sheriffs department.  Yet the man in my second example doesn't have to do anything like that and can live next to a school if he wants to.  A murderer can live next to a school.  A person who chopped off a person's arm can live next to a school.  But not a man who had sex with a consenting adult who wasn't completely sober.    What is the message that we are sending?  Do we really think it's better to severely maim or even kill someone rather than to rape them?  Yes, rape is a horrible crime.  But is it really as bad as murder?  I've been raped and I've had someone try to murder me.  Had the murderer succeeded, I wouldn't have even had the chance to rebuild my life.  And I'm sure that my friend whose face was badly scarred would feel the same way as I do.  There are worse things than rape and the punishment for rape should not be as bad or worse than murder or severe disfigurement.|`|AA11566823	yes i do... i mean its such a pathetic thing to do....esp. when talking about little children.....how can anyone ever get such thoughts and the guts to do such sinful deeds..|`|pIVzPIcyaa	No.    As much as I detest the crime, execution should not be in the hands of the government.    If the family members want to kill the bastard, then that is okay.    But the government should not be involved with killing.  They have no right to take life.|`|AA10745823	hells yes!!|`|Qlhsnbn8aa	Yes they should be...Or castrated and left to live with that.

I think its sick and twisted and damn near just as evil as killing someone.  |`|saSnwtKtaa	Someone who rapes, child molests.. they should be shot with a 1$ bullet and dropped into 6 foot hole.

They have no place in our society.

Put yourself in that position. You are just about to get fried, you know you didn't do it. Now do you think the death penalty is such a good idea?|`|HY8zW1Rraa	I support this idea, because these criminals have consciously destroyed another human's life.  What is the price you can put on that?  A victim of a crime like this has been put into a mental jail from which there is no escape, ever.    Another option mentioned is castration, but I like Flashy d's suggestion too, so I suggest castration by the guillotine.|`|F2wI6NGNaa	what about the falsely accused also what about if a 20 year old has sex with a seventeen year old thats considered rape in some states|`|60bd054cc66b46db672203aa497d3f4eaa	How about castration?

AA10391664	Children, CHILDREN....PLEASE!!  Read this thread. You all sound like a bunch of 8th graders!    What you don't understand is the political machine.  Sometimes you have to loose to win.  And sometimes a win is really a loss.    Let me put on my 8th grade translator and explain:  Ya know that guy or girl that is sooooo popular, the one that everyone wants to be with?  Thats the prize.  So what happens when you win the prize ? You feel good for a couple of weeks and then the whole thing starts to go bad. You fight, you get jealous, you spend too much time worrying, You spend too much effort and money and time on a situation that has no future.    So are you better off "winning" or "loosing".    The world is in a situation that cannot be easily reversed. Throwing good money after bad gives the illusion of progress, but in the end, it just makes a bad situation worse (like a high maintenance babe).    McCain and the republicans realize this now, after the $700B bailout.  Walking away now is not possible, but laying low and letting the winner suffer the loss is a good strategy.    Ever watch "The Bachelor" ? How many of those girls who "lost" are still miserable 2 weeks later. How many of the "winners" regret the whole thing.

Enough to know that HIS ideas and policies for America are NOT GOOD FOR America !!!      The MAIN, bad idea of Obama, that I believe ALL True Americans should research and READ is ..

JUNIOR U.S. Senator Obama is NOT the Best person to be THE President of THE United States of America !!!  .    Why would WE want ANYONE that does not have ANY mangerial experience to TRY to be THE President of THE United States of America ???    Can YOU get over the FACT that JUNIOR U.S. Senator Obama IS going to turn over the sovereignty of the United States to the United Nations ???     ALL ... TRUE Americans need to READ the Global Poverty Act (S.2433) !!!  .  Governors MANAGE ENTIRE STATES !!!    JUNIOR U.S. Senators TRY to Legislate !!!    JUNIOR U. S.

JUNIOR U.S. Senator Obama, the Unions, and the Democrats are sending messages to big business to downsize in America and send more jobs to foreign countries.    Brilliant ideas from JUNIOR U.S. Senator Obama, the Democrats and the Unions (SARCASM) !!!!  .  MOST JUNIOR U.S. Senator Obama Supporters do NOT care about his ideals and policies ... they JUST WANT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN as President !!!

I don't say Palin is "unqualified" in the sense of "experrience" -- though I enjoy pointing out what a lying hypocrit McCain is for hammering Obama on this completely bogus issue, then picking someone who's "qualifications" are being "near" Russia, and having been governor for a few months.    What disqualifies Palin is that she is stupid, ignorant, arrogant, war-hungry, corrupt, and a liar. Those traits and the fact that she stands for evil and opposes good; stands for theocracy and ignorance and opposes fact, reason, and science -- to give just a partial list of reasons.    Instead of listening to liars, why not actually find out what Obama stands for? You SAY he stands for nothing, but that doesn't make a lie the truth.    Like McCain, you seem to think that saying makes things so. It doesn't. There's such a thing as objective reality, and you throwing temper-tantrums and saying it ain't so doesn't change reality.    "Simply graduating from Harvard"? Uh, he did more than simply graduating from Harvard.    And I don't need Harvard to tell me he's smart. Not being a moron myself, I can't tell the difference between someone of intelligence and someone effectively brain-dead.    When Palin tries to speak of things of substance, it's obvious to me she hasn't the first clue what she's saying. Can't you just tell that by watching her try to make policy statements?|`|yrDqtazLaa	Palin doesn't have the qualifications to be vice president! She's not professional, she doesn't know what she's doing, that's that. It's not her lack of education or lack of time in politics, it's how she acts and thinks. She's too immature to help run this country.      I can't believe any of you would be comfortable with her running the country. God forbid if they get elected and McCain dies, we'd be stuck with HER. Good grief, so many of you are naive.    Edit: Sarah Palin needs to quit acting like a little teeny-bopper teenager and start acting like she can be a successful VP. I do not respect someone in their forties who still acts like she's still wearing a training bra.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Democrats believe there are more important qualifications than experience, such as charisma, intelligence, and vision.  Palin's intelligence is questionable, and Democrats don't care for her vision for America's future.|`|fh12fkNWaa	Obama is more than qualified and has a lot of the right kind of experience ---like serving on congressional committees in foreign affairs and teaching constitutional law. But people who question his experience will not take the time to read his resume and see that.|`|AA11352641	Obama's short resume doesn't mean that she IS qualified. No matter who the opponent is she is UNQUALIFIED. She was a mayor of a podunk town, which she left in shambles. She's been a Gov for less than 2 years and has no foreign policy experience or exposure. Hell, she doesn't even have an OPINION on many issues. All she knows is if you are 15 and you are raped and get pregnant, you are having that baby! That's the only solid opinion I've heard come out of her really. |`|1edb7e285e1837d108c2caf03520c8bbaa	the latest poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans don't think she's qualified.

One was smart enough to go to harvard and columbia and the other was not.|`|AA12195052	It is all just spin. If Clinton was qualified, then Palin is. Alaska is a bigger state and more involved then Arkansas. Palin is more qualified then Obama, because he has never been the head of anything, much less the governor of a state. |`|AA10560132	Hon, They are scared, very scared. They will put anyone in OUR White House as long as they are the winners.

They don't know what they are talking about . Very uninformed.|`|FVKIscpBaa	Her unqualification is not based on how long she has held her elected position, it is based on whether or not this person is at all intelligent enough, or even understands the issues enough to take over if McCain dies or to cast a tie breaking vote in the Senate.|`|tiGpryHiaa	I agree.  I get so angry when people make fun of the way she speaks.  I take it personally.  Just because I don't live in California or New York doesn't mean I am just a ignorant hillbilly.  Palin has more executive experience than any of the other 3 candidates.  |`|ZyMHVpriaa	I just look at her education and its all over the place. When I hear he speaking on television I get slightly annoyed that she places her religion on the table as a justification for not supporting certain things (I believe in the separation of church and state) and when I look at the way that she condoned that comment about her opponent during the debate it shows me she has no character.     Bush was a Governor at one point and he was a HORRIBLE PRESIDENT! |`|60x7RSebaa	Many of them are unable to think clearly and for themselves. I have to wonder....how many of these Obama supporters are voting for him because the people in the media say he is the best candidate? Have you seen some of the questions and answers on here? Have you seen their lack of understanding of real issues? They simply put down Palin with immature rants and put down McCain with high school like opinions.......scary that these people may put Obama over the top.     I am certainly not saying all democrats. Most democrats are very intelligent and they have big hearts. However, many of them are too young to understand the issues and go with the "popular" vote.|`|zCpRlu0Daa	The Democrats only hope of hiding the fact that Obama is not qualified and experienced enough to become President is to find a scapegoat. Sarah Palin has become that scapegoat. The problem that the Democrats still have is to hide that Palin is still more experienced than Obama and furthermore she is running for Vice President not President. |`|SLfmBjkOaa	Bill Clinton was governor for 14 years; Sarah Palin has been Governor for 20 months. Here is Obama's resume:    - 3 years as a community organizer  - 12 years as a Constitutional Law professor  -  8 years as a State Senator representing a district with over 750,000 people  - Chairman of the state Senate's Health and Human Services committee  - 4 years in the Senate representing a state of 13 million people while sponsoring 131 bills and serving on the Foreign Affairs, Environment and Public Works and Veteran's Affairs committees|`|WtTFQ4aLaa	hmm, are you saying obama was a cokehead?  do you have anything to substantiate that claim?    I'm not saying that someone with an ivy league education is better than anyone without one.  But just because obama is intelligent doesn't make him a narcissist.  I don't think Palin is stupid just because she says things like, "you betcha!" but I don't really think it's fitting for a vice presidential candidate.    I want a woman in office as much as anyone else.  But just because people are miffed about Hilary Clinton's loss, doesn't mean they should support Palin on the basis of her genitalia.|`|zSeQIDxQaa	Her statements clearly show her incompetence, stupidity and raw malice, all experience and education aside.|`|JjxtWzJtaa	One good reason is that she talks much more about being a HOCKEY MOM then about being the governer of a State. I don't think being a hockey mom qualifies one to be president. That ought to sum it up.|`|qR0Sh8DZaa	MILITARY IS   VOTING FOR ADEMOCRAT!!! I'm a little confused.

Sarah "Barracuda" Palin, has the political world saying first: Who? And then: Why?    The "who" is a young, articulate, smart, tough, pro-life woman who is the governor of our northernmost state. She is conservative and a mother of five, including a son in the Army who is set to be deployed to Iraq on September 11. Her youngest child has Down syndrome.    The "Barracuda" nickname came from her aggressive basketball play on the state championship basketball team. She is a hunter, pilot and lifetime member of the NRA.    She is blunt, outspoken and charming. And don't assume she can't stand toe-to-toe with Joe Biden. She is a great debater. And she was runner-up for the Miss Alaska title, won Miss Congeniality in that contest and plays the flute.    Palin rocks!!!!!|`|GxRTomiUaa	It is easier to destroy your opponents creditability than address the fact of your own short comings.|`|h6QCFsGlaa	This is going to be a little long winded, but this is a succinct summary of the problem with Palin:    I have something important I need to tell you. I anticipate it will result in my receiving a barrage of angry e-mail from Mrs. Sarah Palin accusing me of being effete, but Sarah Palin's goals coalesce with those of xenophobic, drugged-out chuckleheads. Let me start by stressing that I am not attempting to suppress anyone's opinions, nor do I intend to demean Sarah Palin personally for her beliefs or worldviews. But I do believe that I must knock some sense into Sarah Palin.    I certainly don't know what Sarah Palin's problem is, but we should not concern ourselves with her putative virtue or vice. Rather, we should concern ourselves with our own welfare and with the fact that I have to wonder where Sarah Palin got the idea that it is my view that the world can be happy only when her flock is given full rein. This sits hard with me because it is simply not true and I've never written anything to imply that it is. She needs to stop living in denial. She needs to wake up and realize that foul storytellers (especially the shameless type) are receptive to her flighty messages and fool easily. If that fact hurts, get over it; it's called reality. And for another dose of reality, consider that Sarah Palin's convictions are based on a denial of reality, on the substitution of a deliberately falsified picture of the world in place of reality. And this dishonesty, this refusal to admit the truth, will have some very serious consequences for all of us one of these days.    I definitely avouch that frotteurism is a growing threat to society and should be outlawed. My views, of course, are not the issue here. The issue is that relative to just a few years ago, the most censorious skinheads you'll ever see are nearly ten times as likely to believe that my bitterness at her is merely the latent projection of libidinal energy stemming from self-induced anguish. This is neither a coincidence nor simply a sign of the times. Rather, it reflects a sophisticated, psychological warfare program designed by Sarah Palin to promote the squalid propositions of otiose obtuse-types.    Sarah Palin is hooked on designer victimology but fails to notice the real victims: the entire next generation. The significance of this is that her suggestions are built on lies and they depend on make-believe for their continuation. Just as when something flies in the direction of your eyes, your eyelids close instantly and of their own accord, so too does she instinctively and automatically pit people against each other. Naturally, Sarah Palin would have us believe that it's okay to drag men out of their beds in the dead of night and castrate them. Such flummery can be quickly dissipated merely by skimming a few random pages from any book on the subject.    Last summer, I attempted what I knew would be a hopeless task. I tried to convince Sarah Palin that she is a paragon of evil at its most wicked. As I expected, Sarah Palin was entirely unconvinced. She has called people like me shabby troublemakers, socially inept louts, and childish shirkers so many times that these accusations no longer have any sting. Sarah Palin unquestionably continues to employ such insults because she's run out of logical arguments. I suppose an alternate explanation is that the plethora of obfuscating, multisyllabic phrases in Sarah Palin's publications serves only to accentuate the obscurity of her prose. Her fans probably don't realize that because it's not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless, I fully intend to challenge the present and enrich the future. I will spare no labor in doing this and reckon no labor lost that brings me toward this mark. Even so, Sarah Palin's reasoning is circular and therefore invalid. In other words, she always begins an argument with her conclusion (e.g., that might makes right) and therefore -- not surprisingly -- she always arrives at that very conclusion. I, hardheaded cynic that I am, sincerely seek nothing but justice. Period, finis, and Q.E.D.|`|e0127b4e004c1977c834db9ed5e7b10caa	to sling some mud, plain and simple.

Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[14] Bush's grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a Senator from Connecticut, and his father served as U.S. President from 1989 to 1993.    During his 2000 presidential campaign, Vanity Fair magazine and The New York Times reported that Bush, as a child, was not accepted for admission by St. John's School in Houston, Texas, a prestigious private school.[15] In the two years following, Bush attended The Kinkaid School, the private school from which St. John's had broken away.[15] Ironically, Bush, then the Governor of Texas, served as the commencement speaker at St. John's Academy in 1995.[16]    Bush attended the all-boys school Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and during his senior year was the head cheerleader.[17][18] Following in his father's footsteps, Bush attended Yale University, where he received a Bachelor's degree in history in 1968.[19] As a college senior, Bush became a member of the secretive Skull and Bones society.

We should be controlling government, not government controlling us.|`|c423e64eaa411c5e826747d1303e19e8aa	Obama. I hate him, but god is McCain a fool.  McCain is 72 years old and, if elected, would be the oldest president elected in history. (Age isn't what I have a problem with, btw) There is a 1 in 6 chance that a 72 year old American (McCain) will die, thus giving the unbelievably stupid and unable Palin the official title of President of the United States of America.  Need I remind you that the President is the main honcho of the USA military, and that the military deals with foreign peoples, and that Palin has NO experience with foreign affairs outside of 'seeing Russian land from Alaska'.    YES, it's great that a woman might become vice president, and has a chance at becoming president even.    YES, it's nice that she's a "regular American" by being a hockey mom and mother of a [rather dysfunctional] family.    BUT, the Presidency is not a Reality Show where anyone can do it. If McCain used his brain, which I fear is becoming senile, and elected someone with even a little experience with the world outside of Alaska and America, then I would be swayed to his side. But, let's face it. Palin is a big mistake and giving her 2nd-in-command in case something happens to McCain is a BIG mistake, and should that happen, I'm off to Canada.    Oh, one last note: I hate Obama and think he's a pompous ***, but I prefer having a pompous *** lead the country than an ignorant 'hockey mom' in case something bad happens (Read: Murphy's Law).|`|iMaRt7Eraa	McCain because OLD is better than STUPID|`|8f02b0acab933fde792d93566efbe99baa	McCain|`|iYWHCNhCaa	Obama is my homeboy!

THEY ARE NOT LOSERS EITHER.  3)  The economic collapse is a direct result of deregulation of banks and Wall Street.  They need to be reigned in from their corrupt ways.  4)  I WANT TO SEE THE TAX CODE CHANGED TO SHOW TAX FAIRNESS TO BOTH THE SUPER-WEALTHY AND THE MIDDLE-CLASS.  5)  I like Barack Obama's energy plan to help promote e green economy.    All of my reasons are NOT in priority order.  Each item is of equal importance to me.    I know there are many people out there who are red-rock republicans.

However, he also committed acts of terrorism (bombed a state supreme court judge- Murtaugh - and his family and a police station) in NY shortly before BO arrived at Columbia University and it was all over the news during the time he lived in NY.  Michelle Obama worked with Ayers wife Bernadette Dorhn 20 years ago, she met Barack there. BO and Ayers worked on two foundations together, they wrote the bylaws of one of them together. Finally, while he denies it tonight  - Obama's political career was launched in William Ayers living room. Alice Palmer, the State Senator that he replaced attended that meeting and has discussed it publicly on several occasions. Google some of these things for yourself and discover the truth. Please think before you vote. All the best :)|`|AA10222882	Remembering the job of the LEGISLATIVE branch, if you want more of the same, then make sure you have the same majorities in the house and senate.

In general, he comes across as a man of good ethics in his book.  |`|8a3bb05fac18cc11e58899cd0251e212aa	That lady probably meant "Muslim".    Obama's father was Muslim and I've read that in the Islamic culture, if your father is Muslim, so are you.  There's no going back.    So, even if Obama claims to be a Christian, other Muslims may consider him to be Muslim.  I think the rules are different in Islam regarding apostasy, also.

Yeah, Jesse and Al. . .I know, I know. But they never had a chance because of their history on so many issues that just turned white people off, and many black people as well. No one can say that black people wont vote for a white candidate, that's all we ever had To vote for. Personally,I am voting for change, not because he's black. But I can understand why others will, because they finally have someone there that they can identify with. We as a nation at some point have to allow a true representation of this countries ethnic diversity. I don't care if it's a Mexican American, Asian American,Arab American or a Woman of any racial back ground. We have to change that same  "good ol` boy" club that has been the status quo here in our country. We do see it changing with all the white votes that has allowed Obama, to make it this far.

And no, I won't explain this historical reference. It is offered to any american who still possesses half a brain.|`|u4FGBKi4aa	Actually he has many faces. You see the size of this man's cheeks?|`|ciAAdMd2aa	I do but what do you expect... he is old and desperate.  Do you ever watch the Nature channels?|`|SU8Dv2ZAaa	Welcome to politics. Every politician, Bush, Clinton, McCain, Obama, ALL OF THEM, are two faced.|`|qhdhva5Daa	He always has been.|`|Qmgn6JHLaa	Yes.  He's having a struggle with himself--between the honorable McCain and the sleazy McCain.  Overall, sleaze is winning.|`|vWo8EPAYaa	Yes, but you can't really blame him. The poor guy is so old he doesn't remember what lies he has to stick with. Let's cut 'em some slack.    Vote for Obama, McCain will either get Alzheimer's or have a heart attack and die.|`|LgKYrup2aa	At least three of McCain's GOP colleagues have gone on record to say that they consider him temperamentally unsuited to be commander in chief.     GOP Bob Smith, the former senator from New Hampshire, has said that McCain's "temper would place this country at risk in international affairs, and the world perhaps in danger. In my mind, it should disqualify him."     Sen. Domenici of New Mexico has said he doesn't "want this guy anywhere near a trigger."     And Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi weighed in that "the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He is erratic. He is hotheaded."    |`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	He's trying to keep his current base while trying to appeal to independents. He's trying to get ahead in the numbers, although I'm sure he won't!    Obama 08'
AA12221447	Thank You !!!!    What kind of people live here in America? this is so SAD!!!    George Bush has hypnotized everyone to hate people!!!    There is nothing wrong with being Arab! Stop being Ignorant!    Talk about the Damn Issus!  |`|8d143fb05958585be5a5b56c5cbc1006aa	It was an elderly lady.  She probably is scared.  I could see my grandmother saying something like that too.  He does scare people.  A lot of people.  McCain was defending him because people would freak out if he actually agreed with the woman.|`|37qSY5smaa	McCain and Palin rallies are sounding more and more like KKK gatherings.  People yell terrible things about Obama, calling him terrorist, the anti-Christ and making racial slurs.   The woman probably meant that she thought Obama was a terrorist because she said she doesn't trust him.Then she said, He's...he's an Arab!  She was acting like, help us, we are so afraid of Obama because he's an arab and a terrorist!   You are right in pointing out that there is nothing wrong with being an Arab, but I don't think McCain thought quickly enough about what to say.  He probably just realized that he couldn't stand there and let his supporters imply that Obama is a terrorist so he thought he'd better say something to stop the hate in the crowd. He got booed for saying it. Another man stood up and berated McCain for not fighting Obama hard enough. People are getting crazy.   I'm hoping that McCain did it to be a decent guy, but I wonder if this woman and another person who made a comment about being afraid of Obama were plants so that McCain had a chance to defend Obama.  McCain was probably starting to realize that his smear campaign isn't working. It's just making him look bad and getting his most conservative supporters all stirred up.  Michele Obama was on tv. the night before being very nice about McCain.  McCain hasn't been saying many nasty things about Obama personally lately, he just let's his v.p. and wife make comments   McCain needs to settle down some of his supporters down because they are crossing the line.  One man yelled out kill him (about Obama). That is scary and dangerous. Not all of his supporters are like that, of course. Some of the people in the audience looked shocked when this woman said that about Obama.|`|uije8eDraa	Yeah, I thought that was funny.     "He's an Arab."     "No, he's a decent family man."    Like you can't be an Arab and a decent family man. |`|0LfoDLFUaa	Who cares?|`|8cee89129dada555e68d08fe2985fbd5aa	He was just being nice , so get over it and move on and vote for McCain|`|QoQsbPgvaa	Yes. I heard it on NPR this morning. He said it twice.|`|P3rGPVfZaa	yea |`|a20537f9e60f7882d8fd2800775d174caa	John McCain seems to think that he can work across the aisle and bring the Democrats and Republicans together into some sweet natured political family that will sit down, go over things and work out everything together.    Because of this he is trying to get his supporters to stop calling Obama names at his rallies.  He did tell the lady what you said in your question for that reason.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	He is a good part Arab actually, but that doesn't matter, Hopefully he is American before anything else. And yes McCain did defend him and got booed for it. MCCain needs to attack with everything we know about Obama, And he needs to attack so hard that the Liberal Media cannot ignore it.|`|7W1or9Avaa	Yep, that's what happen. I'll give McCain more credit the next time he does it when the crowd is yelling Terrorist, Arab, Muslim, etc.|`|WGdFO8OKaa	Yes the man defended Obama and the crowd booed him. What narrow minded, judgmental people. McCain does the right, decent, human and true thing and gets booed. People should be ashamed of themselves. |`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	he could have been more clear but at least he finally said something|`|ap0cJTRZaa	he sure did. he went from being a terrorist to being a decent man in like 24 hours.    More mccain logic there for ya!|`|X0wJpJ9aaa	Yes, he did.  I think he was wrong for doing it, but yes, he did.|`|MqWZn3Kjaa	yes    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YIq5Q15L...   Its becoming apparent that alot of Mccains supporters are blind racists. This kind of racism among Mccain supporters is appauling and disgraceful to us americans. What the hell is wrong with these people. They hide there racist feelings behind the hes a terrorist cover. Its racism, if Obama was white they wouldnt ask. Please as a white american Im asking end this uneducated embarrassing racism.|`|ZzyRXvvcaa	Yes, he did but Obama has no problem with his supporters saying McCain wants 100 years of war. When it has been proven McCain never said it. |`|eaec01e76ef6d749c67267800ab77f9eaa	Yes, Yes he did
tVegdpmjaa	We have just weeks to go before Election Day . . .  time is running short for us to avert a major disaster for our country. That disaster's name is President Barack Obama.    But this disaster can be averted. I'm confident about this - even though the slanted media are overstating Obama's inevitability.    But the numbers don't lie.    The latest Zogby poll had John McCain trailing Obama by two points. Just two points!    Despite the full-court press to destroy McCain and Sarah Palin, Katie Couric's antics against her, and a daily onslaught of media spin  . . . McCain is still within striking distance.    The stakes have never been higher for the future of the country.    We either patriotically turn the country over to a man who has proudly served his nation in war time and peace - or we face electing a man who has a checkered past, a man who has counted domestic terrorists among his friends, and a man who spent 15 years in a church where his pastor regularly damned and condemned the United States.    Barack Obama is not simply a risky choice as our next president -  He is a dangerous one.|`|FcZU29W6aa	He'll probably try to start wire-tapping and listen in on people's private conversations, for example soldiers in Iraq calling home, oh wait.....Bush already did that.....|`|K60FfiIfaa	Oh my god what if McCain turns out to be the antichrist!|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	If that is indeed the case, there is actually nothing we can do to stop it I guess.|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Good!  Everyday I become more convinced, there is no doubt in my mind, as many intellectuals have said, that it is necessary to transcend capitalism. But capitalism can not be transcended through capitalism itself; it must be done through socialism, true socialism, with equality and justice. Im also convinced that it is possible to do it under democracy, but not in the type of democracy being imposed by Washington. |`|lTlaNwtgaa	then we are doomed|`|hFO5coFKaa	Not everyone likes Obama so he can't be...the Anti-Christ will be trusted by EVERYONE!|`|ea5aa2ea8f93a0625b6b2aff541041c7aa	There is NO chip that can control people.

Because he has great policies?? Because he has been sitting in a christian church for 20 years he's the antichrist?? If you knew anything about the bible, the Anti-Christ will rule from a church, and discard all religions. Obama is going to direct from a government office!! Jeez, can you people think a bit before posting a stupid question?|`|3c0caaa2a4af31674ac41b5023c3c503aa	I would ask Jesus," what would he do" please, next question.|`|2P18wyECaa	People only think he's the antichrist because of the prophecy that he will "come out of nowhere to take power"    Lots of people have come out of Nowhere to become great leaders....but if you truly believe he is the antichrist and arent' fear mongering..you should be happy.   That means Jesus is coming back and we have ring side seats for the ULTIMATE cage match.    People fear that which they do not know...I can't say I blame them...but I wouldn't listen to extremists quite yet.|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	You Are Stupid|`|u8pkuBBgaa	No 'beautiful', you are retarded.  It's a very legitimate question to bring up by this person.  The timing is right, and he certainly shows all the signs of a one world leader with 'all the answers'.  Eloquent speaker, open to all faiths, to name a few... and don't forget he's left handed too.  I'm a Christian and I'm about 95 % sure that we're living in the end times and although the antichrist could be anyone, Obama is definitely on the short list.  My other top guesses would Pope Benedict (because he is supposed to come from Rome) Sarkozy (because he seems to be heading the EU these days or even Prince Charles.  I'd encourage people to research both his coat of arms (which matches the prophecy to a T) and the fact that his name title and name add up to 666.  It was a while ago that I checked this out but it's crazy.  If you research the name-letter-code thing, you'll be astonished that it adds up.  It's not one of those stupid formulas either... it's totally legit.  Actually I'll look it up quick... it's the hebrew alphabet.  All the letters in 'Prince Charles of Wales' come to 666    It's not good to speculate to much though, Jesus will reveal it in his time.    |`|be07e2fee48477531cecc4228cb1dfa9aa	You mean if he turns out to be a Republican?    Remember who came up with the Patriot Act - the most regressive piece of anti-personal-freedom legislation since World War Two.|`|Qo2V27Ehaa	I would support him just to piss people like you off. |`|mwWdGK8yaa	...  Ok, if we are doing crazy hypotheticals now...    what if McCain got elected, then he turned out to die, then Palin was in control, and by summoning the ghost of abraham lincoln decides to nuke the rest of the world.    What if that happens?|`|Feq6xkbYaa	If you truly believe he is the Antichrist than you are retarded.|`|suRNfSS8aa	    you wont be able to impeach him after he is elected|`|I6oWo1RHaa	You are silly|`|WVXkxkMeaa	Impeach him!

whBVo0tNaa	Your question is worded in a way it is making my head hurt.      But, if I got you right, I would say that I have never really been angry about that portion of our countries history.  There are a lot more parts of our history that can invoke anger in me.  I am one of those people that can embrace the strides our country has made in attempting to heal itself from it's horrible racist past.  I also will not allow myself to be blinded from seeing how far far far we have to go.    It only makes sense to me that we would not have had a president other than one who is white and male because if you look at the majority of this nations government, that is what you will see.    It means so much that Obama has come as far as he has.  People suggest this election has nothing to do with race, but that is not really the case.  Obama wakes up every day with the identity of, black man running for president.  No one can ever say they know what that feels like because it has never been done to this capacity before.  If Obama loses he won't be the Democratic candidate that lost.  He will be the black man that lost who happened to be Democrat.  If he wins he will be under a magnifying glass more than any other president has.  If he fails, he won't be just the, "worst president in history,"  he will be the poster child for not allowing another black person in that position.     The pressure this man is under can not be duplicated.  We must applaud that, and we must applaud that in respect to the fact that he is a black man.    Now if McCain wins, ask me again on the 5th how long I have been angry about our country never having a president who isn't white and male.|`|12c6cce6cfd314ae47979facba5d116aaa	Life is too short to be angry. My level of acceptance for intolerance is pretty small, though. When I first realized the realities of America, I was energized to work for change; I did very little, but change came. When I was growing up, African American baseball players had to go eat in the kitchen; they had to stay in separate hotels. That was just wrong. Later, women began to ask fo equal pay -- and people didn't like it. Change has been incremental -- but constant. So no, I was never angry, and ever hopeful. You have to believe it before you can see it.|`|12b80fdaa230e651c6110b0ce2730678aa	I have never been angry... it really is not a big concern of mine|`|YBW1uVgkaa	never.......................|`|AA11722334	I dont care what race or sex they are as long as they are not an idiot!|`|CSbSQfYHaa	I have never been angry about that fact.  What does anger me is that we've had a dishonest incompetent as president for the last eight years and that many Americans were foolish enough to vote for him twice.  I will now vote for Barack Obama because he has the character and intelligence to meet the challenges he will face.    I do acknowledge that race is an issue in this country.  What's important, though, is that a president address those issues of race in a principled, thoughful manner which Obama clearly has done.  The race of the candidate is important only for photo op's.|`|0TnEHVF6aa	I am not angry about this issue. However, I am open to changing the status quo which is that every president so far has been white and male and there's no reason why it should be only that way. Women and people of other races could clearly be president just as well as white men. It's just a matter of Americans being able to see passed the gender and the race to be able to elect someone based on their credentials.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	I'm not.    Unlike liberals I don't hate whites or males.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	Never, and if you have been be prepared to stay angry... both Presidential candidates are white men!|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	I'm not angry!  But How long have you been angry that a black man is closed to being a U.S. president?|`|gnRiLwSxaa	It will probably vote for Obama, but you should realize that this is a Democracy with majority rule, and the majority of Americans are white.
1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	And you think McCains the better choice. Or Palin?    As for what the minority segment will do, nothing. Because many of us didn't vote for Obama just because of his color but because of his policy.    And you might do well to remember he is half-white. So some of the might blame the white blood in him.|`|5c615fe0b021c3a7f40c244c8041457baa	an interesting fact, caucasians will be the minority in the US by 2030  OH NO HEAD FOR THE HILLS!!!!  haha, seriously, what are you so scared about? look back in history and look at all the screwed up The holocaust, Rwandan Genocide, Stalin gulags....etc. its the Majority you should be scared of. and Obama is hardly what you consider a minority, He is american, just like you and me.|`|MxqmRhESaa	They probably wouldn't care. as long as there is a black president they really could care less.

Personally, I think Obama needs to be careful here, because the dare seemed odd to me....it's like Obama is taking it personally, and taking things personally leads to actions you might later regret.

I cannot believe he used the term "freedom fighters" I had forgotten all about that.|`|LzSj90pbaa	I dont care whether you like obama or not, but his campaign staff is absolutely brilliant (they took a lonely unknown senator and have put him up (and are currently winning in the polls) against a man with years of american service). obama has been given enough notice that this will be brought up during the debates, so with the staff, i think mccain will regret this decision. Its best to not bring this up face to face, but continue running ads on it. This way you dont give an immediate chance for obamas to rebut it.|`|zXq4NYXvaa	He'll have second thoughts and won't bring it up.  Right now it is all the ammunition they have.  They can't bring up the economy so if they bring that up tonight and Obama addresses it in front of the millions of voters watching, that ends it all.

But who knows how far these people will go. |`|9sgfh8BUaa	A: Are we allowed to legislate women's uteri?  B: What exactly does that mean? *confusion*    C: Depends on the situation. In today's world, it would be completely unacceptable. China is overpopulated and the worldwide birth rate is already too high.    However, if there was a worldwide epidemic and fertile woman became few and far between, then it would be acceptable. Survival of the species is more important than the rights of an individual.

Doncha think?|`|d265DZbHaa	It is just what right wing bigots would believe.|`|c2f7b7e7c197d88a1a3ae7caa8ff6fc2aa	Nobody is legislating a woman's uterus. Opposition is abortions is about saving the life of innocent children, regardless of where they live.   If there is a law stating you can't commit murder in your house, that does not equate to legislating your house, that is legislating murder.    Trying to use property rights to defend murder is sick. Abortion is murder, anything you try to use to distract from that fact is irrelevant.|`|L9A1LtD2aa	Why not, one more step toward Communism.|`|PqiSHkJOaa	Excellent question.|`|taUG09rbaa	HELL NO! |`|k1jwNKbgaa	Women have the right to use BIRTH CONTROL.........control what goes on in their body.

BTW...most pro-lifers really don't care about your uterus...They just prefer that you don't kill a kid.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	Do you think we should sterilize people who are not up to your standards too?  We are not legislating a women's uterus, we are letting her decide whats right for her own body. |`|XSGgbAwgaa	No, we don't have that right, because such rights have not been taken away from women.

The trick is we have the ability to "choose" what sort of society we'll be - we can "choose" to be free.  We do outnumber the religious idiots who expecit the end of the world tomorrow morning and want Jesus ruling our lives in the meantime (through their favorite fascist preacher, of course).      We can choose freedom.

That pregnancy is their decision and just because they made a bad one doesn't mean somebody else should be executed.  this is the most ridiculous argument I have ever seen and that is saying a lot..    There were actually ywo people above that went out of their way to say "good question"?  School must be out..|`|bQLQdRBZaa	No. That's a felony. It' s called rape.    Though you may get an argument from some of the fundamentalist "Christians" on the far right. when the USSC ruled some years ago that a husband could not force his wife to have sex, they were the only group that objected.    Granted, that bunch aren't real Christians. but you have to wonder. . . .|`|AA10317675	That is like saying the government has a right to force drugs on you, or deny yoru right to take legal medication, just because of laws prohibiting meth use.|`|qtXsNipdaa	Women have the right to be responsible.  As do men.          Rape and incest account for like 1% of abortions. Nearly all abortions are done for social reasons i.e. the baby is unwanted and inconvenient.  Having unprotected sex though was very convenient for them now wasn't it.
tOtHMZQwaa	Not for this war and not for the current Administration.  You've hit upon the  1 reason that I could not vote for McCain.  Even if every other policy he had matched Obama's I couldn't vote for someone who has said that he would not hesitate to institute a draft.  I have a son who's 20 and I would go to great lengths to keep him out of something like that.      I think our troops are all heroes.  But our Administration put them in harm's way for an invalid reason.  How many have died? 5,000 or so?  I can't even imagine all the families and friends that have suffered and will continue to suffer those losses for a long time to come.  Kids who won't know their parents and parents who've lost their most precious asset - all because this war with Iraq was pushed as an agenda.  When people came back and told GWB that they didn't have the intel he wanted, he told them to look again until they found it.      If there was a war worth fighting, Americans would line up to fight it.    As you know, I don't believe that we should be going to the Middle East to fight.  Our security problems are here.  While we're fighting in Iraq, there are Mexican drug cartels who grow pot in our national parks, bringing their dangerous business onto American soil.  We must secure our country.  If it infringes on our freedom - so be it.  It's going to happen anyway - just a matter of time.  IMHO, this should be the first priority of the President.|`|R5f4MjZcaa	I would like to look to our forefathers, when a person who was drafted could pay someone to take his place.      Now that is spreading the wealth. |`|DgfEkFGLaa	We need to turn over control of Iraq to Iraqi-ans. They have surplus of money. They need to finish for themselves. No Draft is going to be "fair" since the money of the rich will always poke loop holes. |`|65755559ca83cd6ecbcfea0edf2b02bdaa	I would rather take my own life than be drafted into some nonsense war. I'm sure lots of others feel the same way as I do too.  |`|QlrIUIfOaa	Absolutely not.    First, Iraq is a quagmire Vietnam times 100.  It is not "winnable" in the traditional sense.  We had the best possible outcome BEFORE we invaded (a regime to keep the Iranians at bay).  Now, short of butting the Baathists back in power, we are really honked.    Second, Afghanistan is another quagmire.  Our best shot right now - silently support Chinese Muslims just enough to tick the Chinese off, and let the Chinese handle the problem for us.  Good luck with that.|`|zYKb2Msmaa	I would certainly hope the next President, Congress and this Country would not go down the path of reinstating a military draft just to send innocent men into hopeless Iraq.  I disagree with you that if McCain wins there will be a military draft.  I do believe that with McCain, their will be a continuance of this War in Iraq, which I agree with you is the wrong path.  I'm nor an O'Bama or McCain supporter at the moment, but if the election was today, I'd have to cast my vote for O'Bama, as I feel we have spent way too much time, money and resources into a worthless Iraq War.  Yes, I agree that our safety is not involved in Iraq. Yes, our terrorist enemies are in the mountains of the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.    Neither will I support a draft just to stay in Iraq. Your question is a valid one.  Thanks for posting it.  |`|tkX8VMDSaa	No more soldiers to Iraq. We will NEVER be able to win the conflict EVER. Not even if we hundredfold the troops.   What we need is to get out of Iraq and begin to speak with all of the leaders around the World to begin some Diplomacy.  How often have we made Friends with Countries whom we previously fought viciously ?  Why not prevent War through Diplomacy and only get involved militarily if WE get attacked.  And we need to make great efforts, to prevent War within our Country.  The horrible attacks coming from the Republicans are very disturbing.  Let us straighten out our affairs before we get involved in someon-elses.  Perhaps we can someday achieve a United States of America. And that should be our first order of Homeland Security.  |`|FvwmRtNjaa	I am against reinstating the draft. And I am too old to be drafted, so that is not a self serving statement.  If america faces a true threat, as happened in WWII, the draft won't be needed--young men will sign up in droves, just as they did back then.    And if we are talking about sillynanny wars like Iraq, then the government has no right to force our sons and daughters into service.|`|T0oCEe6Iaa	No i don't think a draft is needed for Iraq. In my opinion a draft should only be instated when theres an immediate and real threat against the nation. As of now there isn't.    |`|bC04obPkaa	We can't 'win' Iraq. You can't win an occupation which is virtually what Iraq is now.|`|9fc722eaab21e6c85711330a65f2a491aa	Enlistment is up.    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|68d5b7f672196c4474ae9e60bdf04328aa	I believe no matter who wins as long as they support any of the campaigns there will have to be a draft and I have heard that Obama supports the draft for females but McCain doesn't.  I don't know if this is an accurate quote, but I wouldn't be surprised.  I believe we are more likely to get a draft under McCain.  If there is a draft, I believe there will be a high exodus of really smart people in the U.S. and many will protest it. |`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	A draft is bad. No one wants a draft, hopefully it doesn't happen but I do think it's possible in the future|`|qwC8bliqaa	first of all i am republican and i would say that a war that you have to draft for is a war that's not going to be won. it means your outgunned and don't have what it takes to win. A person forced to fight wont really fight at all, except to save there own life. and can your blame them, my dad forced me to played football in high school. and i only gave about 25 percent cause it wasn't my thing. I do believe we can win the war with the troops we have. right now time is our worst enemy.  we need to train Iraq's to defend them self's. and move our forces to other locations,  would just take a little time. i do believe iraq also needs something worth fighting for also before the war is won.( i know i sound like a stupid neo-con, but i still think a well placed nuke would have ended the iraq war in one night,  maybe even gotten bin-laden too.  innocent people would have died, but not innocent americans).    with that said, i think your out of your mind thinking republicans would hold a draft.  history has prov-in that democrats are the ONLY ones who draft.  what i see happening is Osama winning and issuing a draft (if one were to happen , but i highly doughty it)  and then all you liberals blaming bush for it.  just remember though, bush making mistakes does not make it ok for Osama too also. i pray he is everything he claims to be , but who knows.  my grandpa told me once that if i live my life the very best i can. who is president wont matter.  even the worst congress man loves america

What matters is what he stands for and he's a flat-out socialist.  Look at his record.  Look at his associations.  Look at his tax votes.  Look at his support for partial birth abortion (if you don't know what that is, look it up).    It's a choice between someone who has a record of being bi-partisan and someone who is the most liberal person in the senate.    He's changed his position on nearly every issue over the past year.

That having been said, I have never adopted the teachings of Saul Alinsky, unlike Obama, who studied the teachings of Saul Alinsky and has used it as a tool in this election.    "My aim here is to suggest how to organize for power: how to get it and how to use it." This is not to be done with assistance to the poor, nor even by organizing the poor to demand assistance: "Even if all the low-income parts of our population were organized ... it would not be powerful enough to get significant, basic, needed changes."    Alinsky advises his followers that the poor have no power and that the real target is the middle class: "Organization for action will now and in the decade ahead center upon America's white middle class. That is where the power is. ... Our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and the way of life of the middle class. They have stigmatized it as materialistic, decadent, bourgeois, degenerate, imperialistic, war-mongering, brutalized and corrupt. They are right; but we must begin from where we are if we are to build power for change, and the power and the people are in the middle class majority."    But that didn't stop Alinsky and his followers from using the middle class for their own purposes. They counted on the guilt and shame of the white middle class to get what they wanted. In order to take over institutions and get power, the middle class had to be convinced that they were somehow lucky winners in "life's lottery."    Alinsky's radicals found a perfect vehicle for their destruction of the American system and more particularly for taking and maintaining power. That instrument was the Democratic Party.    Obama has been pandering to the middle class, just like he learned to do from studying the teachings of Saul Alinsky. Eyes wide open, America. Think before you push the button that is taking us beyond into /Marxism/Communism.    Liberals, led by their "gang of three",  Pelosi, Reid and the infamous Obama are going to be the ruination of America and bring her to her knees.  Obama isn't out for the middle class, he is out for two classes, "the have not's" and the "have's.  His intention is to eventually eliminate the middle class entirely.|`|l2kD6XQ8aa	I am accountant.  I pay taxes.  I am not addicted to anyone.    I support Obama.
8yE2sYGeaa	It's both.    Powell has always spoken his mind and is a rare politician with integrity (on either side of the aisle).    I am not surprised at the attack by the GOP. This shows, to me at least, that the GOP will do ANYTHING to get elected|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	I can hear it now.    "Dear Gawd! Now this Muslim Commie Anti-christ has not only seduced our top capitalist, Warren Buffett, but now he's seduced our top Republican general, Colin Powell!

Wright type ! I'm not shocked at the GOP turning on him. Bottom line. the GOP only seen Powell and Rice as two stooges who were used a pawns by the GOP to show that they have evolved into a party that accepts all which of course is a crock of B.S. !

That would be extremely dangerous and counter to what Powell has publicly stated on Meet the Press. The Repub-LIE-CON party would never do this in public but will probably get the undercurrents to do their dirty work.|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	it's like they stick their fingers in their ears and go LALALALALA when they start to hear something they don't like or agree with then they get mad and dangerous|`|4TT8lSgwaa	General Powell's view on McCain and its Republican Party has showed to the nation how corrupted Republican Party has become during the past 8 years. I would like to see more Republicans to stand up and to depart from their Party for the sake of  American people and their conscience. I know Obama has already more than enough vote to be the next president. Yet I would still like to see how voters is going to teach all the Republicans on 11/04/08.|`|be6c16b6926046aec5b2aad68fc92dd1aa	I know how he feels, the Republican trolls on here turn on me.|`|WC2GYINbaa	yeah, don't they support the troops for God's sake???

He has learned to jump on the bandwagon.    |`|5kNd3LpXaa	I still have the same respect I always have had for Gen Powell      What I find funny is the Obama supporters, the very people that called him a war criminal for his actions leading to the Iraq war now act like this is the best news they have ever heard.|`|AA12262697	They are shameless and pathetic. It's sad... that's why they are going to lose on many fronts come Nov.|`|381fc498aab62467cef9f64c4cd361aeaa	I find it hilarious considering that they were hoping for his endorsement...they are unsuccessfully attempting to do damage control. It's sad really...But not so much because they had this coming since 2001. |`|PEDuvV56aa	Powell can say what he wants.  Remember, he supported the Bush administration too.  The fact that I'm supporting the Republican presidential candidate does not require my support of every Republican politician.  I really don't care what anyone else thinks.  I make my own decisions.  I will vote according to MY observations and won't let others think for me.  That's one of the benefits of living in a free society.  |`|TuCKAbPTaa	I'm an Obama supporter who wishes Gen. Powell had stayed out of this.    Gen. Powell turned on the American people when he lied in front of the UN about Iraq's WMD.    He needs to go back into his tax-payer funded retirement.    As far as the Republicans turning on him, he knew the kind of people they are when he joined them.    He is bitter because he was passed over by Sen. McCain for Gov. Palin.|`|aI6QFXClaa	The Republican Party is like a Dying Snake ready to bite off its own tail. The Republicans are seeing an end to there 8 Year rule in the White House. They could have been in the White House another 4 years if they would have banded together and Curb Pres. Bush and his wild *** policies. Do I think that the Demarcates are going to do a better job Hell no, but it can't be worse that what is happening now in our Country!|`|Jwd5uIVwaa	The amount of ignorance and hypocrisy in the Republican party is truly staggering. Colin Powell was a fine man (and apparently no one noticed he was Black) until he supported Obama.    Hmmm...makes you wonder what they would say if Condi Rice supported Obama...nah, I'm pretty sure I'd know what they'd say. We ALL know what republicans would say. |`|27sSI5wxaa	Sad.    Powell has been in public service for 40 years.  Now he doesn't have a right to vote for whomever he chooses?    Ridiculous.|`|uVVzr8SZaa	It's even funnier watching the Dems embrace Powell.  Obama supposedly won the nomination based on his position on the Iraq war.  Then he chooses a VP who voted for the war.  Now he's endorsed by the man that convinced American to invade Iraq.  I think it clearly shows that Obama's win over Clinton wasn't due to his stance on Iraq but due to skin color.|`|juG7X5gyaa	I am a Republican and haven't "turned" on Colin Powell.  He has the right to vote for whomever he chooses.  |`|MeACqMGOaa	I turned on Powell when he quit and when he said he was afraid of white Americans killing him if he ran for president.  Maybe I'm ahead of the curve. |`|6hPMnEyWaa	black man endorses black. what did you expect|`|q8UshwzZaa	no, it's sad|`|Qt4DEWSOaa	no, it is sad to see Powell turn against America|`|YVr6JJNBaa	If your not part of the Repub brand, they turn on you. the right wing is gutless, and they should have exile my country    GET OFF DA HATER RADE REPUBS|`|6nBHDvhcaa	Republicans should suck a....|`|lVjJcUj0aa	Realistically I think that it is neither!Powell is not credible since he was the reason we have spent all this money in Iraq!|`|279c61f8b2894fa893eb424eb6ef74e3aa	your funny no one is turning on him...so the Dem's that support mccain and the feminist groups that support mccain...why did they get turned on by other Dem's?|`|DuDMbnAkaa	both.|`|ePhGra7Maa	It is very sad.

John McCain es muy indeciso, impulsivo, irascible y de dudosa capacidad para tomar decisiones en situaciones criticas.Su companera de boleta, es inmadura, acusada de abusar el poder en Alaska y solo tiene a su favor el carisma politico que arroba a los votantes inmaduros.|`|ku08NQ2iaa	EL GALLO ES OBAMA    LASTIMA QUE EL RASISMO NO PERMITIRA QUE EL NEGRO GANE|`|Ph35UADiaa	Obama ganara porque es un negro bello como yo...|`|07e5a034987e384a2795e9baac2e9b93aa	Para los gringos cas siempre aciertan, ahora con mas razn va 16 % arriba, a lo que se teme ahora es al voto racista de la sociedad njorteamericana, es una variante muy interesante en este proceso.|`|IUbHiJqMaa	Barack Obama|`|90RFdqkGaa	OBAMA...|`|AA10760130	Hola pues yo pienso que Barack Obama. =] saludes.

Either there are enough far-rightwing white supremacists out there wanting to do the job and THEY are talking about it, or we believe there are more far-rightwing white supremacists than there really area and WE are talking about it.

AA11132502	It can be due to several different factors.  One is time--sometimes there isn't much time to get anything done except the job.  One is availability--if computers, phones, etc aren't available or the electricity is not working, it makes it difficult to get through.  One of the biggest things, I believe, is that the two people in the relationship are experiencing such different things.  For the person away, connecting with 'home' may make them more homesick than just dealing with the daily grind.  For others in war-torn areas, connecting with 'home' may make them feel too distanced from home, and distract them from their job.  In this day and age, you actually have a lot easier time with communication.  While my dad was in Vietnam, there was only the occasional-and I'm talking maybe twice a year-phone calls, letters that sometimes came and sometimes didn't.  As kids, my sister and I would tape record things for my dad and send them to him.  It worked to help keep him as involved as he could be.|`|tD2O9xLLaa	Not want, it's more or less having the time to do so... Obviously they're very busy over there.  But it can affect relationships depending of the mindset of you both.    Best of luck|`|CRdE8vecaa	Yes...during this period of time, each partner is having vastly different experiences, and trouble communicating certain aspects of those experiences to the other partner can drive a wedge between the two.  That is why it is so important beforehand to go to marriage or couples counseling to anticipate such problems, or at least have many talks about how to deal with these issues before a partner is deployed.|`|FsBUKc1vaa	In my experience, they WANT to communicate, but CANT because they are very busy and stressed and there are limited means of communication.    Most of the time, it is the person left at home causing strain in the communication because they dont understand what their loved one is going through and why they are talking like they are talking

He may not be Bush, but he is an incredible facsimile.     McCain constantly talks about his war record and his years in the senate.  He can not and will not talk about policy because his policy is Bush's policy.  There is very little difference between the two.  McCain is no maverick - he is a yes man that slavishly supports nearly every act of the Bush administration.    The clincher?  The granddaughter of Barry Goldwater (McCain's hero) stated that her family will vote for Obama, and that he would never support the nonsense that McCain has been spouting.|`|AA11539459	Want HUCKABEE settling for McCain|`|H0iYP25Taa	They both are losing tickets anyway..!|`|ERuAlVhRaa	Sounds like you already made your decision.

The Democrats have done everything they can to make the Republicans look like the bad guys.They are just drooling at the mouth to have a puppet government,because that's what Nobama will be the puppet of Pelosi and Reid.Then they can say it's his fault if the country goes to hell.  |`|jYDqknIvaa	OBAMA = OSAMA|`|E5wQt2ECaa	All I can tell you is that as a candidate McCain is in a very difficult position and he has less freedom in what he says about his campaign. It's no mystery he is a republican and with mostly republican qualities and associations. Therefore, he is going to do his best to make sure he is not going to be like Bush, and in most people's eyes he is. Obama has more freedom in showing how different the is because he is coming from a party that has not been in office for along time. most people of the new generation don't even remember Clinton or the democrats in presidency.     Just make your decision based upon which party's issues are most coinciding with your needs and beliefs. Do not be distracted by propaganda from either side.

If they are good enough to serve in our armed forces (as was the case of the american muslim whose memory he invoked) they should be good enough to run for president as long as they believe in the constitution.|`|lVuYMOL0aa	Perhaps being involved with an American Terriorist is more of importance. Obama is chummy with Ayers - an American Terriorist. Perhaps we should be more concerned that he sat in an anti-american, anti-white, anti- jewish church for 20 plus years listening to Rev. Wright.

There's many black individuals that would make great candidates for President. It's a shame Obama isn't one of them.|`|d7Ji9xmyaa	I'm not voting for Obama just because he's black, I'm voting for CHANGE!    We need CHANGE for this evil suppressive society where whites control too much and act racist towards us blacks. Because of evil white control, black people could never reach their full potential!    We need CHANGE for the evilness of where the whites choose to date or marry people of their own race just because of skin color.    We need CHANGE from always having WHITE-ONLY presidents. Now that Obama, a real hero, is in the presidential nomination, America will rise up from its shadows as soon as Obama wins.    Anyone who disagrees with me is at least somewhat racist.    White people, if you don't want a great guy like Obama to win, why don't you just go back to europe?|`|q8UshwzZaa	no    Obama has the same education, experience, compassion & charisma as John F. Kennedy    I voted for him last Monday, the first day of early voting in Texas    Things are bad, but not as bad as they seem.  Remember the Clinton years?  Clinton didn't have to raise taxes to balance the budget, because of job growth.  The economy grew so well, it got rid of deficit spending and started paying down the debt!    Then Bush came along and undid everything good Clinton had done.  He ignored the fact that 70% of the American economy is the CONSUMER.  He gave a tax cut to the richest people and NOTHING to the people who actually NEEDED help.  We are on the verge of a second great depression and I don't want to vote for a man who voted with Bush 90+% of the time.    We just need to do what was done under Clinton again, but this time with jobs that won't have a 'bubble burst'[like the dotcoms did].  For starters, we need to maintain our infrastructure, and THAT will have to be an ongoing process from now on.  [This has been ignored on a national basis far too long]  We need to develop green technology, and green products and energy,a wide open field with incredible opportunity.  Also, paying teachers a decent wage will help stimulate the economy too, when they spend more and pay more taxes [just from the higher income]  This is just a couple of measures that will help, not the whole picture obviously, I have to save SOMETHING for when I run for president.    Obama is a true leader.  He has already said hundreds of times in his stump speech that "we need to turn off the TVs" when discussing education & child raising.  when elected, he will tell us we have to tighten our belts, not "go shopping' like his underqualified predicessor Bush did.    I am a white 51 year old veteran on disibility, a former mensa member & an Obama Delegate, but I am not asking you to take my word for it.  Go to his website, see how he wants to make the world a better place.    I have been waiting 40 years for a candidate this exciting & origional.    I have been waiting 30 years for someone as concerned about the big picture as I've been [maintaining infrastructure, decent teacher pay & universal healthcare]    I have been waiting 20 years to believe that the younger people will get off their collective butts & try to make things better.    I have been waiting 10 years [ok 8] to put COMPETENCE back in the White House!     This truly IS the most important election of your life.    VOTE FOR OBAMA/BIDEN ON NOVEMBER 4TH!

Obama has changed his mind so many time on his political views...  |`|BpiILQVzaa	I have not heard a single white person that I know make the statement that they are voting for McCain because he is white.  I have heard several black people say that they are voting for the crackhead because he's black and as racist as they are.|`|pxKUyKIsaa	No I started looking at Obama when my party picked McCain but I have grown to respect him as the campaign progressed.

When Jessie Jackson ran for office, I didn't vote for him nor did anyone in my family, but there is always this peception that blacks will only vote for blacks, as if we are not capable of looking at the facts and making a well thought out and educated decision -- only white Obama supporters seem to be able to do that. For example, when Colin Powell endorsed Obama, he was accused of a race only vote. Come on . .with his credentials, they had to go that route! He even stated that if this was all about race, he would have endorsed Obama a long time ago. I think it was easy to accuse him of the race factor because his choice was so painful for republicans. Yet, if Senator John Glenn came out and endorsed McCain, no one would accuse him of only endorsing McCain because he is white? They would say he must of mulled over the facts to come to his decision.    I must admit, there will be many blacks that will vote for Obama because he is African American, but for each person who makes this decision, there will be someone else out there who won't vote for him for the same reason. Ignorance works both ways. However, one thing you may not have considered -- there are a lot of blacks who will not vote for Obama because they afraid for his safety (already came up today with assassination attempt) or afraid of any backlash that could be created if Obama makes major mistakes or blunders (like Bush). They are afraid of the impact on black people as a whole if he is not perfect -- minorities tend to suffer for the mistakes of others in their race. Regardless, what keeps me motivated is that I know without a doubt that Obama has not gotten where he is based on the black vote alone. He has brought so many people from all backgrounds and races together to work toward something different, and despite the odds, he has risen above all the hate, propoganda, and dirty and race tinged politics to possibly become the first African-American president in history by his own accord. That says a lot for me -- progress is in motion, but we have a long way to go.     In addition, I do not think whites are racist if they vote for McCain. It cracks me up that people keep saying this. We just have different views and nothing more. You have a right to vote for whomever you see fit. I would be curious to know if any of these people have actually had someone from another race tell them this, or is it just a perception they have developed based upon the media or current events.

2AqU4SjYaa	Do Americans "want" the world to love us?      Personally, I don't give a rat's hairy backside if the loves us or hates us, but they SHOULD love us . . . . seeing how we bailed their backsides out of a jam not once, but twice.      We fought WW1, . . . and when we screwed up the peace we had to go back and do it again just a couple decades later.  That was when we realized that how we deal with the peace is just as important as how we conduct the war.    Germany and Japan were the two most feared, dangerous nations on the planet in the late 1930's.  Now they are both peaceful, democratic trading partners.  What changed?    We WON the war, we KEPT troops on site, and NURTURED their fragile democracies.     That is EXACTLY what we should do in Iraq.   Ten years ago, there was not ONE real Muslim democracy.   Now, we have two fledgling democracies.   We need to grow them into stable democratic governments.   . . . . . unless we want to let them grow into what Germany did after World War 1.       NAZI Germany was worse than Germany under the Kaiser.  An Islamic-theocracy aligned with Iran would be worse than the MONSTER, Sadam Hussein.    Dan in Miami|`|j0wloIVgaa	Because when the whole world hates us something is wrong.|`|AA10240234	Because people think we are still a world power. The same people who  have never travelled outside our borders or even talked to people visiting here from other countries. America is not loved by all and it will be a long time before they do like us again. We have to stop electing incompetent people to our highest positions. We have to think global. We have to be open minded. We have to help find better solutions to our economic crisis, fuel crisis, local poverty, health insurance problems etc...  It comes down to - people just want to be the best but wanting something doesn't make it happen you have to do something to warrant love of others!|`|TPVVuGk5aa	Nah, I'm very liberal and I don't care if Britain, France or Germany love us. The important thing is whether what we are doing is the right thing - Iraq war equals wrong thing. It just happened that the wrong thing, in this case, coincided with their hating us.|`|jftJypfMaa	Vanity..|`|DLsdhfuuaa	Unfortunately we've got a lot of insecure, gullible Americans.  More power back to the individual states.|`|72OuVcA8aa	I don't care who loves us or hates us...I do care that the countries of the middle east, Russia, and North Korea would love for a young, inexperienced man to become President so they could "test his mettle."

Like it or not your question is not a valid argument, even though you try to make it so. Sounds like propaganda to me.

Why wouldn't you want other people of the world to love us?|`|AA10284358	 It's nice to be liked and respected, That's fine as long as we don't have to compromise our freedom or our way of life to have it.

KDde1ovZaa	The term is pro-choice and that is why I stay with that stance. I hope Roe v. Wade is never overturned because that would take away a woman's right to her body. It's her choice to do what needs to be done. |`|0e0fHPuaaa	I think those who make the aggurment for abortion being "a womans body, she can do what she wants". Is ridiculous. Another person inside your body doesn't make them your body. That is still a person. An individual. Who just so happens isn't able to voice their opinion yet. I wish people were responsible and wouldn't make a mistake of getting pregnant when they didn't want to. I also wish they would own up to their mistake and at least give it up for adoption. It would be nice if people only wanted abortion if they got rapped. That I understand. I also understand that it should be the choice of the woman to abort if she might die from complications.  Unfortunately though some woman do want to just get out of the problem they got themselves in. So here we are. I think it should be set to a certain point in the pregnancy where it would be illegal to abort. That is fair. Would give them plenty of time to think about it.     I would also like to add that I am not a religious person. I am an agnostic. For some reason people think your religious if you do not like abortion. |`|AA10240234	I totally agree and I think it is archaic that people actually even talk about this. What women do with their bodies is noones business but their own. Why would I want the governement telling me or anyone else what I can/can't do! That is communism! All these nut cases out there need to find better things to do with their time. Like help all the homeless people on the streets that are unwanted by others. If these people want to help the helpless then go out on any city street and take in a homeless person and care for them and give them medication, clothes and food! After they have helped all those people then they can work on what to do with the unwanted babies they want to bring into this crazy mixed up world!!! |`|fysWsW1Yaa	I think anytime the government allows people to choose to kill an innocent life it abdicates it duty as the protector of life, as in life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.    (Read your thoughts) Government restricting ones choice is a denial of liberty.  If you believe that than it should be acceptable to kill your parents when they become a financial burden and have "outlived" their usefulness.  It is simply my choice not to be burdened.  It should also be acceptable to kill children with down syndrome or other afflictions since they serve no useful purpose, and it is simply my choice not to be burdened.    Oh yeah, I forgot, they are not breathing air yet.  I guess that makes it okay.    Why is it okay to kill unborn children so that mothers will not be burdened yet it is not okay to kill lab animals for the medical benefit of humankind?    Could it be because the poor little animals have not chosen their fate?|`|IMaJbaPqaa	Well said. |`|Rw1Cq1cLaa	Couldn't have said it better myself. |`|B35MtDX5aa	as a male you will never have to worry about making that decision but i totally agree with you about the second part|`|jftJypfMaa	Being pro-choice in no way makes you pro-abortion,though,the little minds won't think so|`|i6kgDVdPaa	if it's personal thinking it's good.Government interference in the privacy ( and hardships) must of the past.( it's better for governmets to control subprime loans& credit cards tansactions not to fall again in deep holes!)|`|VjdkaeL7aa	Yes, despite demonisation from the right- nobody is arguing here for designer babies or aborting people on the grounds of their genes, race, etc- this is just slippery slope crap. The fundamental argument is that we should not be making or enforcing 'morality' laws, governments in democracys are there to protect liberties not to enforce a particular brand of morality upon it's people thus criminalising perfectly good and productive citizens who should be free to pay their taxes and live by the tenets of their own faith/morality.|`|j4lxH23vaa	Abortion robs fathers of their children and kills an innocent life.  Sometimes government must make decisions to protect the innocent.  Such as restricting a mother from murdering her own child through an abortion.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Government can set boundaries.  They should never be involved with the small stuff.|`|AA11593971	Once upon a time, our founding fathers were faced with slavery. Many actually believed (rightfully so) that slavery was wrong... that human beings should not be treated like property. BUT, most of these men also believed that plantation owners/farmers of their era could not maintain their crops without slaves. Consequently, they felt it was not their place to condemn farmers for owning slaves. Basically, they felt it had to be the farmers' CHOICE.     Now I ask you, SCOTT, do you feel that these "pro-Choice" founders were correct... that they had no right or obligation to judge, let alone intervene, in the systematic subjugation of a people? If you cannot condone that pro-choice stance, which was basically pro-slavery, then how can you condone pro-choice today, which is basically pro-abortion? It was hypocritical then and it's hypocritical now.     Admit it, if you dare.    Edit: I notice you didn't answer my question. But to answer yours... what I want is for the government to protect the innocent... Just as the government should have protected the innocent during the birth of our nation instead of rationalizing it as being something only the individual (in this case the farmer) could make a decision about. The innocent slave had no say in the matter, just as the innocent unborn have no say now.     There is NO difference.

His health care will not work. He wants to give 845 billion to other Countries. Not ours though. And we are suppose to be in a crisis.  He wants to help fund his thug friends. He wants to sit down unconditionally with Thug Countries Like Iran, without pre conditions.  He says that we will always be friends with Israel. But, he hates Jewish people. True fact. He will make a change alright. And we won't be able to stop him.    Another one says Bush's policies.  She doesn't even look old enough to blow her nose.

Obama has banked on this desire. But what kind of change do we need? It is a sad commentary when many people are so eager for change that they do not care what kind of change. They do not even ask what kind of change Obama will bring! What if that is a change to communism, socialism, terrorism, Muslim sheria law... hey, that is change isn't it! But obviously, it is not GOOD change.     I want change, but for the better! Change back to a time when society stood on a strong foundation of family values, when America was the shining light of the world and not ashamed of it, a time when we were not afraid to speak the truth for fear of being politically incorrect. McCain has more in common with Ronald Reagan than he has with Bush. I believe that McCain-Palin will be a step in the RIGHT direction of change.    I do not want to live in a socialistic society that penalized the hardworking citizens in order to give more handouts to the slackers ("redistribution of wealth" as Obama calls it, which is socialist economics -- a system that was proven to fail by Marx, Lenin, Stalin...). McCain-Palin (much like Ronald Reagan) talk about the American dream, that anyone willing to work can build a life for themselves and their families.    Obama speaks at Planned Parenthood in support of their abortion policies. Personally, I am pro-life. I believe that every baby has the right to life. Why should we put people in jail who commit murder, but give the OK to a pregnant woman to end the life of an innocent child? Even those who are pro-choice, who believe that women should have the right to make their own decisions about such things, should acknowledge that decisions should always be made after all information is considered. Planned Parenthood is not just pro-choice, they are anti-life. They do not want a woman to have information about options such as adoption, or all of the facts about the emotional and medical risks of abortion. I cannot support a candidate who agrees with Planned Parenthood and wants my tax money to support it.    A tree with shallow roots is easily blown by the slightest storm, whereas a tree with roots that go deep into good ground will stand. America will stand with McCain-Palin. I want to live in the world that Ronald Reagan envisioned. America the strong, the proud, the moral, the just, where opportunity abounds for anyone willing to work for the American dream. I will not support someone who talks out of both sides of his mouth in order to appeal to whatever group that is listening, someone who aligns himself with terrorist and radicals but then claims ignorance. We need to trust our leaders. McCain has served our country and proven that he is a man we can trust.    A house divided against itself will fall. Obama will increase the divide. McCain wants to unite both parties with his cabinet so that is the best choice for unity.|`|fLHGIR9jaa	no no no  you see  they say that because when he's in the office, all the middle and upper class will be left with is change. he will take all ur money to give it to people not willing to work.  that's why they say he wants CHANGE  |`|3LuejgR6aa	A government that caters to big business and doesn't care a whit about the common man.

Stopping change is the difficult thing to do. In fact, it's impossible.     That said, I don't like any of our presidential candidates, but I dislike Obama less than I dislike McCain, if that makes sense. What Obama will try to change is bad rep the Democrats have. While he is held by the same corporate puppet strings all politicians must deal with, if he could move us closer to socializing health care, not interfering with other country's affairs, putting money into education and alternative energy, repairing foreign relations, stopping outsourcing and illegal immigration( invasion ), then it will be a good thing for the US. Obviously the Pres can't just make things happen, but only be a facilitator for change.  |`|t2LZIUClaa	Mr Obama wants to Change the Government.    He said that over and over again.    His recent talks about the constitution scares me.     America is the Greatest nation on Earth.    We have Freedoms and rights unlike any other nation.    To Change the Government and/or Our Constitution Our Country will be no more.    He does not say fix it, he does not say clean it up, he says Change it.  Which we can never let happen.    Every time he says I can Change the Government, I get sick to my stomach.     I know his friends want the Government changed, many of them a radical bunch.    Most of the young of this country do not realize that changing the government will destroy America.     If you have ever been to other countries, you would realize How Great America is. Most nations the people do not have rights, They can not Talk about things in public that are not allowed or they get arrested. Many you can not travel around with out your papers. China you can only have one child. Some Countries you steal, they cut off your hand.  The right you have they do not enjoy.    This is no Place like America, Home of the Free.       I have seen many politicians come and go, been through many elections.  This is by Far the most serious of them all.     Mr Obama spent a Billion dollars on Advertising, Constant Intense stimuli to peoples minds every where. Repeating all the same stuff over and over. in his speeches. Telling you how to feel, think, need and want. That he is the only one to help you and he will change the government.

7hFgMVf4aa	I am 100% in favor of same-sex marriage.  It seems disgusting to me that all the people who got married would be told that their marriages are now worthless and unlawful.    Heterosexual marriages have not suffered because gay people can now marry in California.  It is a matter of human and civil rights and even if you don't like the the idea of gay marriage for whatever reason be it personal or religious, you have to accept that it is a matter of equal rights.  It is similar to inter-racial marriage in many ways.      I always thought America prided itself on being a nation where rights and freedoms are respected and people can be treated fairly no matter their sex, ethnic background, religion or sexual orientation etc.    I say vote to keep gay marriage and allow freedom and rights to be preserved!!|`|8RflQ9DVaa	You are on the side that does NOT want to allow Gay marriage.|`|mHbx8D1Iaa	this gives two positions on prop 8 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQY6qeUxh...|`|Adf16gBYaa	Yes "  Nor Cal Native|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	A yes for prop 8 means no gay marriage  A no for prop 8 means yes for gay marriage

Certainly far more Christian than the liar G W Bush ever thought about being. |`|6d18126e711f352c62adc9c85e6d27ceaa	Today on the Archdiocese of Denver website, the following news item:        Denver bishops release letter to faithful, stress importance of accurate moral reasoning by public servants        Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap. and Auxiliary Bishop James D. Conley have released a new letter to the Catholics of northern Colorado, titled Public Servants and Moral Reasoning. In the letter, they reaffirm the importance of informed moral reasoning when discerning public action, especially in regard to Catholics who serve their country on the national stage.     The last two paragraphs sum-up Archbishop Chaput's position:        In his Meet the Press interview, Sen. Biden used a morally exhausted argument that American Catholics have been hearing for 40 years: i.e., that Catholics can't "impose" their religiously based views on the rest of the country. But resistance to abortion is a matter of human rights, not religious opinion. And the senator knows very well as a lawmaker that all law involves the imposition of some people's convictions on everyone else. That is the nature of the law. American Catholics have allowed themselves to be bullied into accepting the destruction of more than a million developing unborn children a year. Other people have imposed their "pro-choice" beliefs on American society without any remorse for decades.        If we claim to be Catholic, then American Catholics, including public officials who describe themselves as Catholic, need to act accordingly. We need to put an end to Roe and the industry of permissive abortion it enables. Otherwise all of us - from senators and members of Congress, to Catholic laypeople in the pews - fail not only as believers and disciples, but also as citizens.|`|kOvAy4t0aa	I don't see how anyone can call themselves a Christian and vote for Obama.

BTW...Jesus does not ACCEPT all nor does he NEVER ANGER at His children.  Jesus even said narrow is the gate leading into His Kingdom...meaning MANY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED into Heaven...And Jesus threw down with the money changers in the temple...you know the ones that used fake relegion to get rich while taking advantage of faithful believers....Kind of like Obama claiming Christian and being the  1 Abortion Rights politician in D.C|`|tjwMK4RNaa	Why yes, that is exactly why I am voting for him.  I believe in sharing what little I have with others in need, not casting the first stone against others as I have my share of sins, and loving my neighbor.  I also feel Obama certainly would support Christian charity  (or in Republican terms:socialism).  And I feel that in this day and age when the rich get richer (when you don't know how many houses you own, you own too many) and the poor get poorer, maybe it is time for a change.  And for those who want to call liberals, Democrats, and Obama nasty names-I believe you are forgetting the Golden Rule.  I respect your views and agree with many of them, but when you get to the ugly name calling you lose my respect. |`|STm8UQOsaa	In response to many of the false replys you have received, though Obama might consider himself a Christian, and very well might be, he is not demonstrating this very effectivly. Obama has yet to appose any abortion bill that has passed his way. Mccain is also pro-choice, but has the urge to control himself. Obama supports a thing called Partial-Birth Abortion. It is repulsive. Check it out. http://www.nrlc.org/ABORTION/pba/diagram...    extreme huh? not to mention discusting.   this is murder. Do not be fooled, abortion is murder. Any form.

Incase you hadn't noticed, the pickings were pretty slim the year he ACTUALLY won... the other time, well...|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	As if I hadn't noticed.    The answer is that I didn't, and neither did a majority the first time around and almost half the second time around. But the Bush campaign did a good job of smearing Kerry and people were still scared from 9/11, plus the press was under so much pressure it wasn't reporting the disaster in Iraq as it should have, so people didn't know how badly the war was going.    One thing, though. It isn't right to smear other nationalities. You weren't here and you didn't know what the circumstances were. It's wrong to assume that Americans, who come from all over the world, are any more stupid than any other nationality, and I think that if you look at this country's accomplishments -- richest, most powerful, oldest democracy, the unquestioned leader in science and technology -- you'll agree that "stupid" is not a word that comes to mind. All people get fooled sometimes and all countries have unsuccessful government sometimes. When Barak Obama is elected on Tuesday, I think we'll swing back into the wildly successful column.    Edit -- Kingdom Heart, and yet it was Bush who turned out to be the liar, not Gore. The dangers of smear campaigns, no? The GOP set out to convince people an honest man was a liar, and succeeded, with such lies as the claim that he said he'd invented the Internet. Now they've moved on to smearing Obama.

That we shouldn't be meddling in other countries affairs, we shouldn't be nation building.    Even though he didn't do that, that is what people heard and what they wanted. The reelection went through because it is normally not wise to change presidents during a war, even more so during one where you think it is needed (which at the time it was thought to be needed).    Also on the re-election, kerry ran on the ticket of "i'm not bush" and didn't really give us anything else. And even though obama is doing that now, back then people didn't buy it. |`|AA11534634	The same people who are Bush haters are the ignorant undereducated people who support Obama.  They only listen to media hype.    Bush was okay.  He was the least harmful of those running in the last election.  Vote for McCain because he is also the least harmful of all who are running for Pres.  He is not perfect but he has less baggage than Obama.  What do we really know about Obama anyway?  He has done nothing to help the USA.
DsEEATKSaa	Yup. It was a beautiful thing.    Why on earth was he seated in what appeared to be a messy office cubicle type setting, though? It was not a very becoming background. Just an odd choice for a setting, I thought. Kind of belies his import.    ~M~|`|saOsd6ukaa	no, I missed that|`|WOw84q5Laa	Wow..someone finally tells the blunt truth    I wonder if the Obama camp will imply that he is a racist lol|`|zoNJTKUdaa	ahhhh the truth at last,it's encouraging.|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	How exactly is he a charlatan.   Because he doesn't agree with republicans views. |`|nub4fUJLaa	No.  But I did hear him say that Palin is not qualified to be Vice President.|`|AA12045802	No,but I heard him say Palin was.|`|xUQDTEbZaa	No..but I heard him say that Palin is unqualified.....

Insulting to people with mental illness who have contemplated suicide and to people with loved ones who have committed or attempted to commit suicide. Rude to suggest that a someone who has lost a presidential race would commit suicide. Ignorant of the man and what he has accomplished and gone through ie being a Prisoner of War for years, being a respected Senator and running his campaign. Oh yeah I voted for Obama but it was a close race in my mind.|`|78DfeVSOaa	not to much, obama is going to get assassinated

1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	Yes, because America is generally sick of the Republican Party. They don't like the smear campaigning and they don't like McCains plans. Obama is the future white, black, mexican, etc, etc, etc. He is the future.|`|8JouxjL7aa	If I were of age to vote, I would have voted for him, black or white, fat or skinny, gay or straight.

EDIT: he's considered african american because of the "one drop rule" in this country. an unofficial categorization that people still follow today, it was started by Whites, not Blacks honey.|`|5a4a69bba7f9690606dbbf348a2fe160aa	of course not...      he cot 99.9% of his votes cause hes a "brotha"|`|CJiJiQ9Jaa	in your world a half is a whole so that answer is no

I feel a lot more comfortable with him being president than Sarah Palin (and McCain would have gotten assassinated by time). Palin would have been the country's worst nightmare if she got into that office.|`|FvoxgjbJaa	politicians come and go. In eight years Obama nation will be gone and the flawed american political system will be one step closer to outright socialism.|`|Mifqffguaa	I am very sad for our country|`|6mwtZ20Kaa	Not happy, you pretty much summed it up in your question|`|944b14f23dca16304ce58a5d55e2a97daa	I can't say I'm happy, but I'm glad it's over.  I hope Obama will inspire many people to take responsibility for their actions and leave the blame game behind.|`|AA10932670	 I feel very sick to my stomach & scared as hell.|`|m0lxBmPqaa	yes I am happy.. I am not American or live there.. but I can say.. the war in Iraq is not neccesary.. George Bush wanted that war years ago when his father didn't do that and the taxes.. well let we will see.. how does he act? one thing is the campaing.. and one thing is the president.. I think many americans need money and this money is going to be take from iraq because they have soldiers and many destruction in that country.. I think that money could be good instead of that war in economy and to raise that country.|`|THYJUsavaa	Not happy but resigned to the fact that he the next president of the U.S.  I don't believe he's remotely qualified to be commander in chief of the U.S.  but apparently in times of crisis (whether it be war, or economic woes) the American people simply want someone who's willing to tell them what they want to hear.  He whispered sweet nothings and people across the country became all twitter-pated.    I disagree with most of Obama's positions, but even if I agreed with some of them, he lacks the experience and qualifications for the office at hand.  Pray without ceasing for Obama and America.    Blessings|`|7f7547ce6ae07c763915978ab531d418aa	Absolutely not! I hope I am wrong but I think Obama is going to be very bad for this country....I also worry that someone will assassinate him or at least try to. That would not be good for our country either. Obama is much too liberal in his views. I do not believe in sharing the wealth. When someone has worked hard all their lives, then they deserve whatever they've earned & been able to save. They should not have to share it with those who sit on their butts & draw welfare. No, I am not even close to being rich. In fact, I fall below the poverty line but I manage so it won't do anyone any good to say I'm rich. I am rich only in blessings. I have a wonderful family, many, many friends & the privilege of good health. Not to mention the inalienable rights of all people plus I live in the greatest nation ever on Earth. I know because when I was married to an A.F. man, I lived in several different foreign countries. No I don't think Obama is the best man for the job but I can't change that so I will just pray that he won't be as bad as I'm afraid of.|`|an7eyj1caa	I'm happy we live in a country where leaders are chosen by ballot, not by force.|`|uCrL6IYjaa	Yes =D    Because If I Was Old Enough To Vote & I Lived In America, I Would Have Voted For Him|`|atoTPVdFaa	ABSOLUTLY NOT ill take GOD and my guns, you can have obama             NOBAMA!!!!!!!!!|`|9p7fUR4daa	yes because i dont believe in hearsay. nobody knows about tomorrow.|`|84d441d577f45c96575c1787b675bd4aaa	Yes I am happy. He also won the majority of the vote so most people in the country are happy too... I wouldn't pay too much attention to those people |`|Lq1M1vDIaa	A crushing defeat for America's rich get richer philosophy.|`|u8kUCFJSaa	I am so NOT happy. Obama has Islamic ties and is ssssoooo socialist. It has nothing to do with his race, (which if you don't like him people call you racist) but his ideas and beliefs.|`|qAUcN7GXaa	I am not happy with Obama being elected President. I do not agree with the direction he wants to take this country in. That being said it is a historic moment for America. I just hope in years to come when we look back at his Presidency it id not the disaster some predict it will be.|`|DbCO4ThNaa	YES Im very please. Mainly because hes a Democrat. i just hope he does make change like he says.|`|BzSB07TCaa	no cause u wanna know why..... this is the united states of america once know as a republican country and he is a fuc*ing black man named barack husain obama we might as well have just elected a terrorist.... i am so mad and surprised that he is the new president and i am disappointed in this country|`|AA12136376	President-Elect  Robin Hood sickens me. I just hope that I am wrong about the Redistributionist in Chief. The welfare of my country means more to me than being "right about Obama the socialist scumbag".    Then again - there were lots of peopl who were more concerned with "Being right about Bush being evil" than they were about the welfare of this country - that they vindictively did whatever they could to block, ruin , or otherwise supress any of the good ideas that came from the political right. They never gave GWB a fair chance from the start, so why should I give that douchbag Barry one?|`|GsVZlD1faa	yes  Because we have stayed the course it is time for a new direction.   I know it will be hard and we haven't hit rock bottom yet but at least there is hope for the future.|`|hIXUeW6qaa	I am happy that Obama will be the next president, I believe he has excellent qualities. He has that drive and the positive attitude that America needs right now. And this election just shows how far we have gotten. Barack Obama is the change we need. A change for the better and a ray of hope.|`|3GlfUtLRaa	 I am happy also... I don't think that Obama would ever do anything to hurt the people in America. I also think that people are making up things to make Obama look bad. I'm happy Obama won not only because he is black but because he had to struggle to get to the point that he is at now and McCain is really old if he was elected I don't think that he would be able to live to keep America safe. Being President is hard work and McCain was not fit for the job.|`|s18HcD9uaa	I voted McCain however I am happy Obama won now. I think when he gets in office and does nothing he says he would all the people looking to be taken care of and those wanting a free hand out will be sorry for the choices they made . These are hard times for every one but most of us have been through hard times before. No one person caused it and no one person can fix it.|`|y0rhCec2aa	there are allot of issues on who would make a good president. neither would. but I voted for Obama and hope his words speak action rather than just words, and that he represents all races not just his. its history in making for all blacks on having the first black president and they feel its been long over due,.I fear for Obama that if he favors one race that assassination might erupt which will cause a war among blacks against whites in this country. we must not forget we are one people and we all share this great nation together. there shouldn't be blacknwhite issues but in reality there will always be. change for all including all races will benefit this country and let his actions speak for himself with all those promises and we will see in the next years to come if we all voted correctly. |`|T9XbaspMaa	i'M SUPER happy     I cant even say how happy I am right now :D|`|ebjeij32aa	barrack  obama   hes kl|`|Naz6gmjOaa	Go back and read through YA today...this is the 1,000th time someone has asked this question.|`|MannYZf7aa	Very happy.I believe he will make that change that we need.|`|riAlt51Naa	   yes, and those who still chewing on o'riellys farts , obama is not socialist, |`|AA10465540	Yes, I am.  I think that we are starting off on a new path that will be good for the U.S.|`|Ftw2TN5xaa	People are stupid .   Hes gunna be amazingggg , i love him :)|`|OJxo6F2baa	Yes, We Can!   W Obama|`|bOWATFgoaa	people are stuck in their ways!!! they are afraid of progression. obama has the best and brightest surrounding him. |`|AA10648704	I'm very happy--If McCain won, my husband and I were threatening to move to Canada.  Even if he were friends with the Iraqi people, that doesn't make him a friend to terrorists.  We have a graduated tax system here in the United States--if you make under X amount, you don't pay any.  If you make X, you pay 15% on anything above X.  If you make between X and Y, you also pay 28% on the amount above Y, then you pay 36% on any amount above Y.  There used to be another level, but Bush got rid of it.  All Obama wants to do is add that tax bracket back in (39%) at $200,000 ($250,000 for families).  So unless you make over $200,000, you don't get a tax increase.    He's also in favor of letting the Iraqi government take over its own battles, like they want to do anyway, and moving troops to where they might do more good, like Afghanistan.      I hope we can change this country for the better.  There will always be bigots, but I learned a long time ago that there tends to be less racism the more people of different races get to know each other.  Maybe Obama will be a catalyst for change in that, too.       |`|RM0JTFjlaa	No I am not happy at all. I could care less what color he is but most people who voted for him only voted because just that. No one really seemed to listen to his plans such as ban fire arms.   It's in the constitution it's an ammendment the american people have the right to bear arms for our protection.   He wants to slow the progress of weapons such as nuclear and space....every other country is doing that and we'll appear vulnerable. He wants to increase taxes on wealthy and give to lower class. Sorry but I don't want my money goin to people who live on welfare and too lazy to get a job and decide to have 10 kids.   He wants our troops out of  Iraq now. Yes we do want our troops home but if we just pull out without finishing the job to the rest of the world we will look weak.  He wants to cut back on our defenses....remember 911 anyone?  And last but not least his full name is Barack Hussein Obama and he is of Muslim descent. No wonder the middle east likes him so much  Hopefully I am wrong when I say America is in for a rude awakening|`|hy3lyDuQaa	Be thankful we all live in a country where we have the freedom to vote for who we choose....or do some of you prefer Cuba, Iraq,, Iran or  China......|`|l3aIrR8saa	it aint no need to worry now im happy..  he pressident cause he democrate ..a republican never vote for any of them cause along time ago in 30 or 40 it was a depression and the president then was a republican u think about it bush is a republican u seen how thing got with gas and price of food and other stufe went up so they can faten there pocket a republican is for people got money the heck with the lower man that dont make much that strugling so and mc cain is a republican so im happy obama got it it just to many people pegudice that going to talk about him im not pregudice but u look on the othere hand if mc cain had got it in time they ***** about that cause when people go bank rupt or cant feed there kids cause of a republican |`|AA11288623	Im a Afro Canadian and I just hate hearing the media saying it is a historic moment coz an Afro American became the first Black president. First off he is only half Black and second of all what the hell does the color of a man's skin have to do with being a leader in the free world. I can guarentee you many of his voters were black americans who voted not because he was the best choice but because he is black. In Canada , Obama is bad news for us because our Canadian Troops are in Afghanistan fighting for something the Americans started decades ago and hearing Obama last night saying he will up the troops in Afghanistan and seek more help from his foregin counterparts (Canada) just makes me sick. He will be no different from any other past president and he will be no better then the Bush administration, Obama tried to be like Martin Luther King and used inspirational speeches to woo Americans but after his first 100 days he will do nothing significant for the US...Im not a Sarah Pallin fan but in 2012 im quite sure she will be the US first women President and she will make more significant changes then Obama will ever do.
1RTwcBXraa	Initially I think yes because you are of adult age. But, it seems that some adults that have been an adult for many years can't even stop with the drinking and driving. Everyone knows that many teens will do that as well. Mix that with their inexperience in driving and less mature mindsets, its a disaster waiting to happen. Also, hormones make young adults act crazy at times, add alcohol and its nuts!!|`|10818851f82ffad5915ce8b2f1c142f7aa	I'm 17. I'd only have a year until I could legally drink.    I don't think we should allow teens to buy alcohol. Waiting until 21 is acceptable; most humans don't gain their faculty for 'good decision making' until age 25.    So, no. I'm tired of kids being allowed to consume alcohol. One is still referred to as a kid if one is under 25. I'm sick of hearing about kids in rehab. Better education about drugs and alcohol consumption. Then I might support lowering the drinking age. Too many people die from these things for it to be even CONSIDERED right.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Yes, you can go to war and die for your country, why can't you drink at that age!      USMC 68 Vietnam (58)|`|7uznrLBXaa	Maybe.  If it is lowered, the penalties for DUI need to be seriously increased.   Actually, increase them either way.  The first thing I learned when I started driving was not "drive slow."  It was "this is a thousand-pound weapon."      I treat my car like the weapon it is.  I was raised around firearms, too - I treat driving with as much seriousness as I do a gun.    26.|`|AA10932670	Old marine is right.let's just lower it to sixteen & we can watch more people die because of booze.We won't have to watch them go to war & be killed.They can stay here & die in their own country & take lots of others with them.29.I don't know what makes you think they aren't already drinking at age 18 & lower.Too many teens die by car wrecks & other ways already.|`|QJqBGT0uaa	Not really. I think it's fine where it's at.  Im 14.  In fact, most 21 year olds cant even handle alcohol without abusing it. |`|d10c7fc96d98c9c741a090a216616361aa	waht next? Lower it to 16?|`|r18gdj2Baa	Yes and no!    Yes, because my argument is that if I can sign the dotted line and go die for my country, I should be mature enough to have a drink!    On the otherhand, I also remember how I was when I was 18, and I was not exactly mature when I was out having fun!|`|sQGm97USaa	Well I am 21 and I do believe it should be changed. To be honest if you can fight for your country then why not be able to drink when you want? Also it is not like it really is stopping anyone now is it?|`|gSwobfujaa	i do not think it should be changed to 18. even though, legally, an 18 year old is considered an adult....they mentally are not. i have always been more mature for my age...and even at 18 years old i was irresponsable. of course i managed to find ways to drink anyways...and i would drink n drive which is so terrible. at 22 years old i wont dare drink and drive and think how crazy i was before. in many ways i still think 21 is too young but thats not gona change. so...no it should not be lowered. children are way too irresponsable for that. they have not earned our trust by that age. :-)|`|fKyUs6eCaa	Yes I think it should be lowered to 18 because if you can go to war and die for your country then you should at least be allowed to drink also.  Another thing, there is no set age for maturity.  There are 40 year-olds that shouldn't be allowed to drink because they are too immature just as there are 18 year olds who would drink maturely and not overdo it.    I am 20 years old.|`|CeXJleChaa	18- i don't think so, most 18 year Old can be pretty irresponsible and having the drinking age would cause more chaos and complications in the world|`|RkeX5UdIaa	I think so but then again i am only 15    In Mexico you can drink at 18 (at least thats what i heard) so i think it should be allowed here too    But i do think you sould not be able to drive within like 12 from the time you drink at all until you are 21...|`|pLROPKyQaa	i've always thought that stuff like drinking, smoking and voting shouldn't depend on your age its should depend on your I.Q., because people should be smart enough to do those things responsibly. they shouldn't drink when they drive, smoke around kids or vote for someone without knowing what that candidate is for or against.|`|98o4gdhtaa	I agree fully with oldmarine08. I am 25.|`|QiwZRLf8aa	yes   and everybody done had a drink before 21(not that that matter) but yea 18 is a good age!|`|m0GxfPSgaa	I think it should stay the way it is. all of these people saying they can fight at 18 why not be able to drink at 18   UH if your in the military you can drink at 18 !!  |`|UM0V3Xn9aa	There should be no drinking age.|`|vK6GmBENaa	 i really dont think thats a good idea..not for me @18 or anyone i know.. my age 23

There he is. He's devolved into grade-school taunts. Seems fitting, somehow.    ADDENDA    Your name says it all... He has always opposed Prop 8.    "Schwarzenegger: Proposition 8 fight isn't over"    "he urged backers of gay marriage to follow the lesson he learned as a bodybuilder trying to lift weights that at first were too heavy for him. "I learned that you should never, ever give up. . . . They should never give up. They should be on it and on it until they get it done." " http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articl...

It's not like it's going to stop them from being in a relationship or having sex. And it's not like if they're allowed to get married then they'll all of the sudden show up in your bedroom doing the dirty.     Really, how does it impact your life? I'm just curious. If it's a religious matter, then do you live your life by the bible, or only when it suits you?       Anyway, I feel that he is doing the right thing. If they are life partners and want to get married then they should have similar benefits as a hetero married couple. Taxes, spousal decision when the other is incapacitated, applying for homes and loans as a couple should be available to them as a couple and it has no impact on my life. I'm glad he's standing up for them.     Also, especially for illapino83, there awas a study done to show that the more one shows hostility and intolerance for gay men the more likely it is that he's a closet homosexual. They also have shown that they tend to be ashamed because they're turned on by homosexual activity.  Fine examples of this are hate crimes aginst gay men by "straight" men... it usually turns out that the offender has either had gay sex with his victim, or another man.     Homophobia is more a cover up than a fear.|`|WalnRzfGaa	well since Prop 8 is unconstitutional i feel he is doing the people a favor.    get your narrowminded views out of here.

If you're a Cuban you can get into the country with no problems because you are "oppressed". If you are Mexican or some other Latino you are turned into some kind of monster who wants to invade our country and steal our resources. When I was working in the restaurant business years back at an Irish place we had young kids coming to work from Ireland almost on a weekly basis, no green card, no nothing and they were never bothered, never called names. In the back of the house we had the Salvadorans who were in most cases also illegal, working two and three jobs, not getting stupid drunk every night like the Irish were and just trying to get ahead. Now most of those Irish are gone of their own accord and I know of at least three of the Salvadorans who are citizens and own their own businesses. These are just human beings like all of us who want the same things as the rest of us. It's just an accident of nature that we are born here and they are born there. Where's all that famous compassionate conservatism?|`|qksvRJIyaa	As long as they work cheap and don't kill the Americans, I'm cool. But NO MORE allowed in! We're chock full.

I don't support anything that is illegal.  Illegal immigrants are knowingly breaking our laws.  People who knowingly break our laws are called criminals because they are committing a crime.  If a person has committed a crime in their past, has been caught and served their punishment for their crime, and does not commit that crime again, I am fine with that.  However, I cannot condone people who are currently breaking our laws.    We need to stop giving these people any kind of benefits, severely penalize employers who give them jobs and landlords who rent to them, arrest them and send them back to their country of origin.  Then we need to charge their country of origin for our trouble in dealing with their citizens who break our laws.    Perhaps then they'll respect our laws and try to come here legally.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I think illegals are ruining the very culture and fabric of this nation. Why must we accommodate the Spanish language when America is an ENGLISH speaking country? Why do we allow illegals to get *perks* when the Americans  are working?

Took him years, but he went through all the hoops and did it the right way. He wanted his kids to be born in America. And he eventually died a proud American citizen. Never, ever, did he take one dime out of the system. Never even unemployment. Paid his own way always.  Why do these illegals think the rules do not apply to them?  That they are special in some way?   Am I to accept that they are better than my own blood?   That their presence is a blessing to us all?   No way in hell.  Simple equation: Be legal or be gone!|`|1NO10YfPaa	It is a tough situation, but illegal is illegal; and, I see no way that the United States can just throw open the doors to everyone who wants to come here without total chaos.|`|9XqLKtpraa	The way the economy is going we are going to need those low paying jobs just to survive. I grew up in the 1950's and 60's where my dad was lucky to make $5 a day to support 5 kids and a wife. In the 1950's our home didn't have electric or indoor plumbing, same with our school (outdoor toilets in our school). My dad would have loved to have anyone of those jobs for any pay as long as he could feed us. I can remember picking weeds to eat I was so hungry. My parents are both American born and so are their parents. Let's hope times don't get so bad as to return to those days. Our nation can only do so much. The flour barrel is going dry.|`|AA10841434	Illegal Immigrants are just desperate people|`|AA12048193	i believe that it is a huge problem and i live in west virginia no national borders here and we still have a problem with illegals. as a matter of fact there is a town not too far from where i live that a sawmill was busted for hiring illegals. It takes jobs away from real Americans (including the ones who come here legally) and puts a huge strain on our governmental systems, such as welfare, social security, etc..|`|4aLq5pDnaa	I hate it!!!    I want the troops brought home and many of them deployed along our southern borders.  The rest of them should be used to round up ALL and i mean ALL the illegals load them on trucks, busses, trains whatever it takes and ship their sorry @sses back to mexico.    The troops should be shooting those invaders on site.    those bastards are coming up to the U.S. and using public welfare, healthcare bringing with them a moral decadence not welcome in America.    i want those sorry bastards and their kids and the white trash bytches that marry them removed from within the usa.|`|xz3NflVbaa	These comments are specifically about how I feel on Mexicans illegally immigrating here.  I'm torn between two beliefs. I don't think it's okay for people to illegally cross the country. I don't like the drug trafficking between the US-Mexico boarder and I always get eery when I hear about people getting robbed, hurt or murdered by illegal immigrants. I also don't like how they use false identification and stolen social security numbers. But I also understand that most of these people are not bad. They're coming to the US so they can have better opportunities. I think Mexico needs to work at becoming a more developed country so the people there don't have to feel like they can only succeed by coming to the US. I also believe it has to be easier for people to legally immigrate to the US. I also don't think the Mexicans already here should be deported. That would tear families apart and would really hurt our economies. I do think they should have some path way to a visa but not necessarily a green card. However I do worry a little about how that would affect our economy. Who will work on the farms and other jobs that Americans supposedly don't want? Without low wage workers, does that mean our consumer products are going to be more expensive? How will that flow along with the great amount of inflation our country is going to experience in the coming future? So you can see, I am torn between two sides.|`|98a5c705254e76745e000a1bd7e067edaa	"How do you feel about illegal immigration?"    It is basically a non-issue. The real issue is illegal employment.  If immigrants did not have jobs they would not be here. Untill we start arresting, prosecuting employers it does not matter, they will always find a way in if work is available. They do not come here from points south to enjoy our fine weather, American cuisine and friendly, happy natives.  |`|klkSiZlKaa	I don't believe in criminalizing human beings who are simply trying to follow the money.  If Americans can set up sweatshops all along the border just inside Mexico, then Mexicans should be allowed to come here too.    Of course, it's never been about actual justice and human rights.  It's never been about patriotism . . . even though patriotism has been an effective tool when tricking working class people out of uniting across national borders.  But hey, if the capitalists of the world are uniting, then why not us!?!?

You might open up with a fake new piece about the white house getting hit by a 747 or a college campus or church getting shot to hell by radical muslims trained in the CA sized terrorist camp that Iraq became after a hasty US withdrawl.    But in reality, the US has done a great job over there of late.  Iraqi security forces are way more capable than they were, and the violence has died down a lot.  The new agreement with the US military has us pulling out of every town and city by summer of next year.  We still need troops in Iraq but if all continues to go well, we won't for very much longer.      Personally, I don't think we should ever have been there.  But Patraeus and the men and women of the US armed services, their counterparts from other countries, and the Iraqi security forces have done outstanding work making the best of a bad situation.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	Another possible 9/11.     EDIT:    I am sorry if my answer was unclear- what I meant to say, specifically, was that if you pointed out to people that keeping our troops in Iraq could possibly prevent another 9/11 type attack, they might be persuaded that keeping the troops there is a good idea.    We haven't been attacked like the September 11th attacks since we have been in Iraq, have we?|`|oYb4yC0jaa	Because I bought the same Halliburton and Blackwell stock options that Cheney did.|`|bkkO2uw0aa	people want to talk about the troops who have died in Iraq as a way to say bring them home, the truth is this war has had very little casualties compared to previous wars. Also by cutting our losses and turning around you are making it so those soldiers died in vain.     people don't realize the strategic role it plays for us to be over there. it is a knock on Irans door, a warning saying you may want to comply with the UN.

DZP77kRUaa	You ignorant person. read a little bit of news before you make some kind of comment like you just did about oil. Research how much the U.S. has "made" off of Iraqi oil. Not much, by the way. Also take a moment to look up "yellowcake" being removed from Iraq and you will see one reason why we really went to war.|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	The US went into Afghanistan as a result of 9/11 and to strike a blow to Al Qaeda. During this time, the President committed that we would seek out terrorist organizations around the world. At that time, which most people seem to forget, many countries in the world believed that Iraq had WMD. Iraq was bluffing and we called their bluff.     The US went into Iraq for three main reasons  1) Confirm or deny the presence of WMD and remove them if found.   2) Remove Saddam Hussein from power  3) Support the installation of a democratic government, one the world could live with!!     We accomplished all of those missions. Now it is time to move on. The  1 complaint against the Bush administration, is they never left. We just keep on and on and on with no end in sight. Apparently Obama has a plan. We'll see!|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Your question shows your ignorance of the situation. There is nothing wrong with ignorance as long as you are attempting to learn of a subject. And you are asking questions! But are you asking them in good faith with a real desire to learn more about it?     What would have been accomplished by capturing/killing UBL? We would have felt better, but would we have improved the situation and made America safer. I would argue that we would not have made America safer. We would have made UBL a martyr without changing the root cause of terrorism. Liberals are always talking about root causes and that is what President Bush was addressing for the last seven years.     The Middle East is the proving ground and spawning ground for Islamic Terrorism and this stems from two main causes, neither of which are poverty. ME people are oppressed by regimes that do not allow them a voice in their society and simultaneously blame the West in general and America in particular for the conditions of the common man in the ME. The despots keep the people illiterate and tell them what they should believe and what is written in the Koran and what is going on around the world. An illiterate population is worse than an unarmed population!     President Bush recognized that to change the ME we must introduce democracy and we must do it in a big way. Iraq has been in violation of the UN cease fire agreement since 90 days after it was written and in violation of numerous UN resolutions. Every intelligence agency around the world, every democrat in government and out including President Clinton who made it American policy to remove Saddam from power believed that Saddam was developing and stockpiling WMD. Saddam believed this as well and was fooled by his yes men scientists who were too scared to tell him that the WMD programs were all fraud. And lastly Saddam was allowing thousands of Iraqis, mostly children, to die of starvation as he used the oil for food funds to build palaces. For all these reasons, President Bush with the full approval of 90% of the democrats in congress conducted Operation Iraqi Freedom. And we saw immediate results as Saudi Arabia loosened restrictions on elections and Syria and Libya gave up their WMD projects and transferred WMD products to America.     Lastly your guess is absolutely wrong and the proof is right before you. Does America control the oil industry in Iraq? I hope you take all this to heart and learn about the world.    Sorry, one more point. As far as capturing UBL, try to find a single man in California which is about the size of Afghanistan. And while you are at it, keep in mind he is probably in Nevada (Pakistan) anyway. And he is completely ineffective and living like a rat in a cave.|`|9rhmeb7raa	Over 80% of Iraqi oil production is under contract to a French firm. Go to the link below. It contains the reasons why the Congress authorized offensive military operations in October of 2002. We began those operations in March of 2003.   We began offensive military operations in Afghanistan in October of 2001 to overthrow the Taliban regime and go after Al Queda.   You assume Osama Bin Laden is in Afghanistan. It doesn't matter. He was the financier for Al Queda and the chief theorist. Others planned and carried out operations. The one who planned the attack on America of September 11, 2001 (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed) is in detention at Guantanamo Bay.|`|BuGz6eU9aa	oil?  seems to me that gas prices are up and we sure the hell used a lot of oil to get the oil.|`|6OLiuM9Gaa	Several thoughts come to mind.    We don't know if Bin Laden is still alive. I have reason to believe he is not. However both sides need him to appear alive. Naturally Al Qaeda needs him alive as a rallying point. Oddly, so does the US. He's kind of the ultimate bad guy that we've all come to hate. Were he dead, there would be no support for the troops fighting in the Middle East. With him alive, even the Democrats think we should be in Afghanistan.    The only way Al Qaeda would allow him to die is in a hail of infidel bullets. My guess is that he had some cronies with US-made weapons and US-made ammunition on hand to make sure that's the way he died. Dying in that manner, he would become a martyr... and we'd never been rid of him. There's no way they'd let him suffer the fate of Hussein.    The reason we sent troops to Iraq was because some people didn't want us to get him after Desert Storm. "We've done enough," they said. "Time to come home." The military protested. A wimpy President bowed to the will of the people. For 12 years Hussein violated the conditions of the ceasefire. For 12 years the UN passed resolutions and placed sanctions on him... he just smiled and continued business as usual. For 12 years the people of the US and the world blamed the US military for not getting the job done when they had a chance. For 12 years administrations failed to take action for fear of damaging their ratings. Then 9/11/01. People were angry. They wanted to strike back. So Congress passed a bill to use troops in Iraq -- it wasn't a unilateral, power-grabbing, oil-grabbing move on the part of President Bush.    For two or three days we were a country again. The President said that people are either with us or they're against us. Both sides of the aisle joined hands and sang hymns on the Capitol steps.    Then something terrible happened... campaigns started. Politicians running for office will say anything to get themselves elected. And we buy the bull stuff. Yesterday you were either with us, or you were against us. Today it's ok to be "just a little" against us... anything goes in a campaign. Dissent is the only reason for multiple political parties. If we worked together, we wouldn't need them at all.    Suddenly you have a divided public where once there was a united nation. One side said, "Remember Desert Storm? Remember how the public demanded the end of that conflict in spite of what the military recommended? Remember the hew and cry in the UN and in Congress? Remember the broken promises by Hussein? Let's support the troops by enabling them to finish the job this time." The other side said, "War's bad... any war. The only way to stop war is to not participate. If we eliminate our military nobody will have any reason to want to fight us. First, let's just pull our troops out of Iraq. We've been there long enough. If the military can't get the job done, well just chalk it up as another loss -- another military screw-up. At least we won't be spending any more money or losing any more lives over there."    Why are we there? One guy with whom I chatted put it this way. "My orders didn't say 'get cheap oil.' They didn't say 'get the guy who tried to hurt my daddy.' They didn't say 'find WMD.' They said "Iraqi Freedom.' That's why I'm here."|`|22tPNksKaa	Probably not oil. More that Bush wanted to punish him for standing up to us. Or more likely to put the squeeze on Iran. (look at a map to see where Iraq, Iran & Afghanistan stand next to each other.) In theory, it looked like a good strategy. But the pincer was itself caught in a bigger pincer. Like pinching a dogs tongue and getting your fingers bit off!    But yes, we should have stabilized Afghanistan/ taken Bin Laden out first. THEN go to Iraq. There is no substitute for manpower in an occupation.    Who keeps thumbing me down? Am I being stalked? I gave a good answer!|`|AA10206116	If Bush wanted to control the oil industry, it would have already been done, and we wouldn't have seen record high oil prices during the summer.    I can't give you a definitive answer as to why there was more focus on Iraq than Afghanistan, but I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that Saddam should have been taken out of power during Desert Storm. America was blamed for not taking him out even though the rest of the world also took part in the war.

The word I would use is usurper, because he is using all the key public issues as a front to gain notoriety, and pushing an agenda different to what his front initially was.  On the other hand that is the world of politics. He is a person of the socialist order and I personally don't like socialist policy. It has been so bad for its forefather nations (Russia, Germany, China). It always ends in oppression of a defenseless people who do not have even the right to carry arms to defend themselves against inhumane social doctrine.  The final thing I would add is that after speaking with a high ranking member of our government, it was confirmed that our president Obama spent 12 million to avoid providing an authentic birth certificate. The one floating around online has also been confirmed as a forgery. As practical people, I understand this must sound impractical and impossible. I would accept it as that if it were not for the political state of the world. We are certainly in a very delicate position politically.

5BOZ2ryLaa	When it comes to getting custody,  the amount of "dirt" won't matter.  What WILL matter is what is in the child's best interest.    Why is your husband slacking off?  You need to find out, just to be sure there's no real reason for him to be concerned.  A five year old child will have a person appointed by the court that looks out for the child's best interests.  This person will not be associated with either the father or the mother.    Check your phone book for custody attorneys.

But it can be very difficult in he said, she said cases.  You might have recorded what you were told but that is hearsay to the court.  And courts will typically think that joint custody is fine.  The problem is that the same qualities you need to make joint custody work, are the same ones you need to make a marriage work.  So we expect those who have a failed marriage to suddenly make joint custody successful.|`|aA2dQuiAaa	As I am going through this myself (very similar situation - except the father is very motivated) you should know that you will need a lawyer and you will spend a lot of money to make this happen.

No nutrients and too many calories.|`|6ee3feb6285fbcb7ae64e5552099eccaaa	please don't take this the wrong way because i am in a similar position and do sympathize with you. you say you make 1480 a month before taxes. ok lets take out almost a 1/3 for taxes and that leaves 1000 + 400 (food stamps) + 595 (child support) - housing that leaves 1140 a month or almost 300 a wk. do you realize how many people are much worse off in this country? i for one am.|`|IUXriZQJaa	It is not Republicans who say poor people don't pay taxes. Democrats try to imply it so that they look charitable, and that makes you look like you aren't doing all thge things you are doing to make ends meet.    I am not a financial advisor or legal counsel, but I'll try to give a few pointers based upon personal experience and layman's attempt to understand the system.    It sounds like you are trying, not being a deadbeat, and you don't deserve to get treated like one.    I know what food stamps and food share programs are. They don't give you enough unless you don't work at all. They punish you for trying to be productive. They mess with you every time you try to break out of the endless cycle of dependency upon their programs, and I think that is their original intent and purpose. Public assistance programs are supposed to help people just like you and just like those in the position I and others in my family have been in and gotten out of, but I would argue that that is not what the programs do or were actually designed to do.    Depending upon where you live, the public utility programs should have a cost-sharing program for folks in your situation.     HUD and other federal, state and county agencies should have programs to assist you with housing, since the amount you cite is well below the published federal poverty level for a family of 5.     Now don't get mad at this. It is a word to the wise.    Cell phones are a bit of a luxury -- one which most people have lived without for most of their lives -- and you could get along with just a land line, which I am sure the phone company could discount based upon your economic status. State sponsored day care is pathetic, so I wouldn't advocate sending your kids there, but in your income bracket, it should be free or close to free.    Chips and soda are horrendously bad for you. Every dollar spent on them is virtually wasted and could have been spent on something with more nutritional value and less adverse effect upon your health (and that of your developing children).    You don't have to have everything everyone else has. That is the main problem with this whole current economic crisis. People have been taught that they have a right to be fed and clothed as well as others, and they don't. Any assistance you or I get is a privilege, not an entitlement. Don't fall into that trap .    Also, if I were in your shoes, I would consult an attorney about getting more child support for a family of 5. Depending upon what the father does for a living, you may have other options.    Surely, supporting a family of 5 on less than $2,000 per month net income is a heavy challenge for anyone. Hold your head high knowing you have made it this far.      ----    Caroline -     First, it is not bias, it is fact.  Second, it is in response to the followup that she wrote under the question -- or didn't you read that far before answering?|`|eMYOiim8aa	The government calculates about $6.50 per day to feed one adult which I agree doesn't really cut it, but it has worked with families who have improvised and made it stretch.  I know some who do it by catching those sales and cutting out high cost cereals and buying oatmeal instead, eating less meat and eating more potatoes, rice and noodles. Some have turned down the heat and wear warmer sleepwear. There is help for those utility bills and since you have children you may qualify.    Edit: Bob, that was totally unnecessary to add your bias on Democrats.|`|Ulff1hcDaa	Food stamps is a supplemental program so it's not meant to pay for all the food you need.  Here is the math...    As far as the feds are concerned there are 3 types of expenses:  housing  food  everything else    The feds say that in a perfect world your housing costs (rent plus utilities) would be no more than 50% of your income.....food is 30%.....and everything else makes up the remaining 20%.    So, as a food stamp worker (assuming you meet all the income and resource tests) I would look at your income and compare that to your housing costs.  If your housing costs are less than 50% of your income then I ignore these costs and you will only be eligible for a small benefit....maybe $14.  If your housing cost are more than 50% of your income...say, $100 more....then I assume you are spending $100 of your food money on your housing so I would grant $100 in food money.      I'm not saying you only need $100 to eat for the month, I'm saying that you will....using the fed's magic formula....come up $100 short after spending 30% of your income on food.    There is some more math and other complicated junk but that's the idea.|`|AA11206135	Because according to your last post you do have a job and you do make 9 bucks an hour....And if you "only" get 400 a month give up the chips and soda and buy fruits and vegetables.

Because I don't DO those things. I ate rice, and beans, and peanut butter sandwiches till I couldn't stand it anymore. Then I sat there sobbing for a few moments, regained my composure, and made another pan of rice. I've been doing this for over 3 years now.. I hate it. I'm ready to be DONE with it. But I can make it work till the money is better. It's a struggle sometimes to get the daughter to eat it. But she does. Why can't you have those things? It's because food stamps are supposed to help you buy food so you're healthy. Junk is JUNK.    Yes, I did this while on WIC. Not once did I wonder why WIC wouldn't pay for diapers. Or chips. I did wish that it would pay for Veggies, but I didn't complain to the internet about it.    You've posted this questions THREE TIMES|`|Xv48a4Zuaa	First let me say I sympathize with you having been in that same position before and having the person who handed out the stamps acted   like it was THEIR OWN MONEY. My wife and I  were BOTH out of work and with three children and one on  the way,BUT we made due with what we had been  GIVEN.   It was a HANDOUT.  We REPAID  that debt by helping others who became as unfortunate as we were. We had the PHONE changed so we could only make  local calls. WE  did a few odd jobs for gas money AND WE TOLD our CHILDREN we WERE OUT OF WORK AND HAD TO TAKE FOOD STAMPS, therefore we would have to do with out soda pop ,candy and the like until we could find work full time and we hoped it would not be long.    And  fortunately it was only about  five months. before WE both got back to work,  .    I never had a job that paid nine dollars.     After thirty four years at my job I was let go with only one day notice and found out that my retirement fund with the company was non  existent. Fortunately during those years i put a few dollars away and i mean a few. Sometimes only two or three dollars each week.    But my  savings was enough to get by for a  while. At sixty eight i still do freelance work a few nights/days a week.   I make about a thousand plus a month.including $483.00 SS.  i pay my cell phone $ 46.00, energy bill $225,  65 degrees in the house, ceiling  fans , no AC summer , cable bill $64 ( I need  the internet for my work)  water, sewer and garbage , $ 45.00  and yes I buy a few  soda pop from time to time, don't like chips. Would rather have cream cheese and celery.       I send  birthday cards and  Christmas cards to my nieces and nephews who live to far to visit.I buy my  seven grandchildren  presents at Christmas, nothing extravagant, just a present to remind them i LOVE them and am still alive if they want to come visit.    For many of us life has been and probably always will be a struggle. But every morning  you wake up and find yourself on this side  of  the grass  look at your children and say, "At least I have them to be thankful for"  then go to work and you will have them to look forward to in the evening.  And if you are a believer ( i am agnostic) then thank God you got through another day. Do things with your children, walk, talk, share a secret thought , there-within may  be  your salvation.     And may things turn around for you in the near future. ( I have a feeling they will. It will be tough for a while.)    May the gods take care of you and yours. Our thoughts will be with you.                                      joe
3lEMNFFzaa	Yes, he could be terminated.  it depends on his type of job or work, and how willing the employer would be to hire a temp until your boyfriend can return.  He may qualify for temporary disability in the meanwhile, and if he is fired, he would be eligible for unemployment benefits.|`|G2auAv1Saa	What have they said the past 5 months?   Is his employer covered under FMLA? If so, no- but he only has 12 weeks.   It depends on the rules of the company and the laws in your state.|`|qUhntdzvaa	Yup.  It's a bad time to become a business expense.      I'll think of your boyfriend next time a crotch rocket come screaming by me on the interstate.    Still, it was your boyfriend's decision to drive a motorcycle.  Everyone with common sense knows they are dangerous.  Accidents happen and when you are on a motorcycle there's an exponentially greater chance of getting hurt.  Even if it wasn't his fault it was his decision to do something dangerous.    Kinda like having sex without a condom. Sorry he got hurt but people have to live with the decisions they make.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Your employer is not required by law to hold your job even if you were injured at work. Its sad but true.  They are running a business and have to have help.  Hopefully they will be willing to rehire him after his recovery.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Not if he can supply medical notes from his doctor saying he is unfit to do the job. It is his onus to give them letters in an appropriate time.    Depending what his job is he is not guaranteed to have the same job when returning if they always need that position filled.     The only thing they have to give him is employment, they can put him back down to the lowest position if they see fit. it sounds like he ma not be a great worker if they are talking of letting him go.|`|UQWusO1waa	sorry for your Bo, but i dont think it is the employers responsibility in any way. If he does choose to rehire him would be nice.  I rode motorcycles for years myself. Do you think since your BF rides M/C  knowing the high risk of danger, He should he have to pay his employer the extra cost to find  and train his replacement when he gets into an accident and cannot work ?|`|zHD8tnDBaa	I think it depends on the state. But maybe, that is long.|`|0plFo5A1aa	depends on where he works. i think they can, but if hes going to be out for that long and someone hit him, he will get a big settlement. if he gets fired, how much does it matter if hes not working neways.|`|2n7UgPkkaa	You need to be more specific. Depending on his condition, where he works, ECT. It varies between jobs and how bad he was hurt. I believe he could sue if he fired him, but for THAT long he most likely will be replaced|`|85jy4Mt0aa	If he is qualified, he has limited employment protection under FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act).  That only lasts 12 weeks and does not include income protection.    If an employee is unable to perform the tasks assigned, the employer has a right (and an obligation) to fire that employee.    Some employees, especially those who understand the risks of life, purchases short-term and long-term disability insurance, so that income continues when you are unable to work.
2564ebc136b77a929f696fad679511c4aa	True. And after the war broke the economy in two, the GOP house leader puts in his obligatory appearance every single day on the nightly news, voicing belated and wholly unconvincing concern about the cost of stimulus packages.

Too ludicrous.|`|a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	Bush was conciliatory with Kennedy on the education bill and look where it got him.

That is why Conservatives are screaming at them today... the Republican party capitulated much too often when they should have been sticking to their ideals.     Apparently, the Republicans are starting to listen to their constituents and are sticking to their guns.

If you think about it Republicans controlled congress for 6 of the Bush years yet when Democrats took control they found a way to make it seem like it was Democrats with the problem and also blame everything on Bush.

Look into it.    As for a bipartisan effort -- the repubs offered a plan that costs 1/2 the amount and provides twice the jobs.      If the dems provided a method for getting troops in afghanistan for 1/2 the time and 1/2 the cost, I'd be on their side.    And if I may -- if the democrats had done what Bush and the Repubs had requested both in 2001/2002 and 2004, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place b/c most of those loans were made 2004-2006 w/ fannie/freddy holding at least 60% of them.

RkfIPD7Iaa	Other way around, they will query the IRS on the facts.  People do not usually claim MORE income than they had when filing those forms, they are more likely to list LESS income, either to lower their support payments or to raise them (on the part of the recipient).      In either case, the IRS would know their true income.    Short answer is to tell the truth, you WILL be caught.    A minor aside:  the term you wanted was 'jibe', meaning to agree with.|`|Gezfmghuaa	That's an entirely possible outcome.  It depends on the nature of the statement, whether it is under oath, etc.      In all honesty, it also depends on the amount of the variance.  The court, while they have the option to notify the IRS, they will not do so if the difference is a few hundred dollars, for example.
hqnAq4iuaa	No he is not. Israel merely defended itself against the Hamas attacks.    The casualties are Hamas's fault. Take a look at this video:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk63dX8EK...|`|MqXbtvP9aa	Absolutely.    Murder|`|AA12098193	If you would judge Olmert by the legal standards applied on  citizens in your own country you might see the answer.    Israel has in general shown disregard to international law so the leader of a country that shows no respect for law would, in your country, be considered the head of a criminal organization.  If people died in a place the police has had a siege on (like Wacco) then there would be at least a police investigation because responsibility must be established. Olmert is not under investigation because he is beyond the law or else, just as Bin Laden, is beyond reach.  If a prison authority decided to stop allowing the distribution of food and water to inmates he would be found guilty of unlawful use of authority and possibly torture. Israel interrupted the flow of food into Gaza for months, an action banned by international law. Nothing happened.  If the president in your country decided to end a hostage situation in a school with missiles, he would be considered a criminal. Olmert says Hamas are terrorists hiding behind children so he gives the order to shoot the kids first so the terrorist have no where to hide!  If a person like "Matzah" said that the death of the hostages should be blamed on the terrorists that kidnapped them and not on the man who gave the order to blow the place up, he would be found mentally disabled.

A 15 minute break to answer a few questions every couple of hours or so is just what I need to get back and focused on my job.

It was pretty interesting but I imagine it was written by a bunch of out of work Star Trek writers.  By 2057 we could be back to starting fire by rubbing two sticks together and chasing down deer with spears.
4t2kd03Waa	I do not know the current navy recruitment requirements, but if you need the 15 credits, I say get them.   The Navy in general is more technical than the army and the skill you learn could be of great monetary benefit in civilian life.  Beyond that, you have a bed, a hot shower, good food and get to visit many area's.    Contrast with the army, with some sergeant yelling at you to roll out and get ready for that 20 mile march.  You get to camp out in the army also. Them snakes, spiders, and scorpins crawling around at night should not bother you. The army does have outside showers sometimes in the field.  You get to carry a rifle around with you also.  If you would rather do this than sail the seven sea's laced with unknown adventure then join the army.|`|dSbAz63baa	Go marines Excel and become Force Recon or go army, Excel and become a Ranger.

However, my experience is in a technological career, which unfortunately you would need to graduate college for. Having met many people in different branches of the navy, many enjoy what they do. On the other hand, don't even think about telling a Marine you're serving your country while in the Navy. The Navy will have a better quality of life while providing important service, but the Army will earn you respect and personal honor.|`|g8CsCKpGaa	In the Navy, my job was to fix the machines that did the killing.  In the Army, you are the machine that does the killing.    Oversimplified I know, but it all settles out in the end.
6Fsliwlhaa	1) Health care is as long as you are active unless you do 20, which in that case you can still pay for Tricare when you retire.  If you went to a combat zone the VA will cover you for life for combat-related injuries and illnesses.    2) You can take classes while on active duty using Tuition Assistance, which is $4,500 a year.  This is separate from other benefits and the only catch is that you have to pay the money back if you fail a class and it doesn't pay for books.  The Army College Fund and the GI Bill can be used right away after you ETS.    3) Yes, if it is in your contract you get it as long as YOU do your part.  If you get kicked out of the Army before your ETS date or get a bad discharge for misconduct you forfeit most, if not all of your benefits.    4) If you are single you stay on base in the barracks for the duration of your service.  If you have dependents you can either live in post housing or off-post.  Either way, you leave base when you ETS or change duty stations.|`|480393beb0bd8d738e3d33a34301d4faaa	1.)

v1dnnMQuaa	The Posse Comitatus Law forbids it, the only time the military can do something like that is during a state of emergency (like if there's a disaster or riots and the governor calls out the National Guard, but they're considered state troops when that happens). If someone witnesses something happening close to, but not on base, they should contact the local civilian authorities and report it.|`|sfCnE2O4aa	There is a law forbidding it, can't recall the name of it right now, but it exists.  Bush wrote something up to cancel the law and I'm confident Obama will do whatever he wants too.    Bear in mind that a machine gun takes precidence over your or the policeman's rights.  And the Military has plenty of machine guns and now that we're enlisting Mexican's who HATE US, it won't be long before they're pointing machine guns in our faces and pulling the triggers, more times than not.  We're done in this country.  We live in a war zone.  It is coming.  Smart people move.|`|92jr44kFaa	Absolutely not.  In police affairs, Soldiers are the same as civillians.  There is something of a comradery there sometimes.  Police Officers talk differently to me when I'm in uniform.  It's on more of a buddy level.  But Soldiers don't have the right to jump in the fight, unless the officer asks for help.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Members of the Military Police or military personnel who are performing duties are forbidden to enforce laws off of government property against civilians unless martial law has been declared.  If a military person sees a crime he could act under state law in some states to do a citizens arrest but that is something allowed civilians also; the laws from state to state differ and some might not allow that.  From the drawing a weapon statement I think you are talking about military police or security people and the answer to that is that would not be legal/Constitutional.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	yes there are laws about this.  military people do NOT walk around with their weapon on them. let alone carry their weapon OFF base. heck most do not carry a weapon at all (other than security forces, or the MP's)  our Security forces do not even leave the base.  anything that happens outside the base is for local law enforcement NOT military.  after hearing some of the stories from my husband at the range,,,there are many i would not want carrying a gun around at ALL.|`|Ro03hVb6aa	Absolutely not.  A member of the military has no authority (in a civilized country at least) over the civil populace except in very exceptional circumstances (like a state of emergency for example which is enacted by a lawful civilian authority and has pretty strict conditions).      The law which deals with this is usually called something along the lines of separation of powers, hence the reason serving members of the military are barred from holding political office or being court judges etc, and does other things like separate the courts from the government too.    Your scenario would probably be called a citizens arrest as outside a military base, the civilian police have jurisdiction.  In the country I live in, the Police need pretty good reason to draw a firearm to arrest someone, (even though we own lots of guns), but assuming it is justifiable, grounds like reasonable force could be argued in a civilian court.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	If a MP sees a crime being committed right off the Post, they can detain the suspect untill the police arrive.    Military police are allowed off Post, when in hot pursuit    But military mp's don't work the gates on most post anymore, that job has been contracted out.    Now it is mainly military retirees doing gate duty.

cBNjgxW9aa	I've held the opinion for many years now that governance is a matter of balance; the idea certainly isn't original with me since our foundding fathers designed our entire government around a system of checks and balances, but they didn't anticipate-nor could they-that economic theories such as supply side economics would become so deeply ingrained and lopsided over such a long period of time.  And lest the supply siders take offense, let's not forget the great and sweeping social welfare state envisioned in the 1960s.    However, supply side economics became so broadly and deeply entrenched in our system of economic management that Keynesian theory, at least in some quarters, was referred to as "discredited."  A good friend of mine-staunchly conservative-stated at one point that Reagan had proven that deficits 'didn't matter.'    I didn't buy either of those ideas, and never have.  Supply side theory has it's place in the economic mix, but it does rely on a constant flow of federal funds from the consumption side; in a free market, supply and demand is driven by consumption-and the fact that 2/3rds of our GDP is driven by consumers tends to bear out the free market principles to which we subscribe.  However, when the government steps in and begins tweaking the economy with various incentives and disincentives, the free market can become truncated and begin to plateau, putting too much economic weight at the top, supported by a foundation of consumption that eventually begins to crumble.    When that happens, we end up in precisely the situation we have now found ourselves; consumption is tapped out, supply is strangled, and multiple 'fixes' have to be rushed into place...government responds by cutting interest rates and taxes while cranking up the money printing presses.    So I agree with you in principle, and am very concerned about the high risk situation we are in, but I don't see a whole lot of options at the moment.  I don't think the issue at this time is so much where the President is steering the country, but the out-of-balance government where both parties are subscribing to the same economic theory exclusively for so long.  Special interests and single issue voters need to find common ground and send a clear signal to legislators; we must reconsider our defintion of debt as wealth and cease defining its creation by investment rather than innovation.    My opinion is that the crucial juncture of the economic downturn will commence in March of 2009 and conclude in the fall of this year, corresponding with agriculuture.  If credit markets and climate collude to weaken yields-with the expected results such a collusion might yield-we could find ourselves in fresh jeopardy from a new direction.    I think the ultimate outcome-if we can avoid a full-blown depression-is going to be one of very somber reconsideration of entitlement programs, government infrastructure funding, credit market regulation, and tax rates on both individuals and businesses.  I hope that the more bipartisan approach that the Obama Administration seems to be adopting will moderate extremes before the printing presses are cranked up and the money disbursed, so it is spent where it needs to be spent and heads off wallowing deflation rather than spurs runaway inflation.  Double edged sword-and a very delicate balancing act.    Great question.  A balanced budget is the only way out-but we are so deeply at risk I question when we will be able to acheive that balance and how to go about it.  I'd love to see a serious issues related conversation about what programs need to be cut and how, as well as how much inconvenience the population is willing to bear...so far, we don't seem to want to tolerate potholes, surrendering our retirement travel, cheap food and energy, or sacrificing the water polo team at our local high schools.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	How do you think we got in this mess.

The Republicans are going to end up fixing the recession, and the Democrats will get the votes for it.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Cutting taxes actually increases tax revenue.  The problem is that our federal government is not required to stick to a budget, unlike every American household.  If I don't stick to my budget, if I buy things on credit that I really can't afford, if I am greedy and stupid, I go bankrupt.  What makes them think the same rules don't apply to them?  Oh, wait, they do.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Yes, that is the most dangerous.

93M8Vccvaa	Look at this one. Seems to be pretty good. http://www.peacemakerpepperspray.com/sto...|`|5Rj2chSAaa	Most pepper sprays are going to give you the same effect on an attacker.  The delivery method is the biggest difference.      Streams will go 8 to 12 feet, sprays will widen as they go out and foggers will pretty much saturate the air, but can be affected by wind.  The difference is that the "pepper" enters the pores quicker if it is in it's smallest form.  So the fogger would work best, but it will not go as far.  The stream will go farther, but not work on the target as fast, as it is not in an arosal yet.  Gels and foams work well to stay on the target, but will take a couple of second to begin working as well.  The larger the container the more powerful the deliver method  ( think fire extingusher) .  So I recommend you get a larger unit in the home or work area where size is not an issue so you can get the better distance.

AA10578359	Trouble is it sounds a whole bunch like the Democrats are helping out the corporations and the rich people more than the regular Joe's that live here.    Isn't that what they said about the Republicans?  Didn't the Republicans in the House vote against this bill because it did not do enough for the middle-Americans?      I'm so flustered.  Hopefully there will be more clarity of action and understanding now that the Democrat's have their hand in the big cookie jar without anyone to stop them.  Maybe those with big ideas and poor concepts will begin to see that it is NOT the way it's been portrayed.      Republicans are for the American people, and Democrats are for special interests, big business and rich people.    What a way to turn the tides, though.|`|d7rOO1Zwaa	Well, first of all, a government "stimulus package" will not help the economy, period.  Second, what did you expect from those who believe in Saul Lowinky's Rules for Radicals?  Third, you gotta love it when Obama breaks almost all of his campaign promises (example: he claimed he would not sign anything with pork spending on it), but the media ignores it.    People support this stuff because the media is in bed with leftists and they can't or won't reason through this stuff for themselves. They tend to believe what the media tells them because they believe that the media keeps politicians and government honest. Ha!|`|kprKXEOSaa	You're right.

That's life.|`|AA12212403	The phrase, you get what you pay for comes to mind.  People were lied to and empty promises were made and now they are up in arms due to this stimulus?  I could have predicted something like this, but I never felt it would be this blatant and this soon in his administration.  Sadly, this man had only 17 months experience as a senator before the fact that he can give a great speech thrust him before the public eye and mass hypnosis-like hysteria and an unpopular existing president allowed this sham of an election to put him in power.  His choices of cabinet members (tax cheats!) and the attempt at this horrendous stimulus so soon show me that we should be afraid, very afraid for the next 3.97 years.  It's going to be a wild ride.  I sat there shaking my head during this election and still have to pinch myself to see if I am awake when I realize just what little experience this man has.  He is naive and lack's judgement.  Oh, for John McCain and his solid years of judgement and sacrifice for our country.  Oh for his solid military strength during a war that we need to get out of, but with honor and dignity.  No one listened to him as they were too busy hating Sarha Palin (who was victim of a media smear campaign and really a good candidate) and elevating this man to something he was not ready for.  So, you get what yo pay for and we Americans will pay dearly.|`|up40wvywaa	No, they should not, but the Dem's will defend it.    They are doing what they have always done.    The reason the Republicans voted no on the "Child Health" in 2006, was because of the pork.     Every Issue That Means Something Important To ALL People  The Dem's come up with in all kinds of Bills in the name of children, homeless,layoffs, the poor, the military families, veterans. The list is way to long. Then they fill these bills full of pork spending. So when Republicans expose what the Dem's are hiding in the Bills. The Dem's then use the mainstream media to make the Republicans look like they do not care about the people.    So why shouldn't they use the same tactics that won them both houses of congress and the White House.    They make things look and sound good, but it is not. This is called manipulating the masses.|`|f6e4526698ad112fa58d2badd73e2e1aaa	Prior to this so called " Stimulus " package, Obama's popularity was at aprox 80%.

I think that if you ask they would supply one. Have fun never been on a ride along yet, but would like too.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	It depends on the department. Most wont give you one (they cost a lot) but others might, just so you feel as though your a part of it.

Just in case the poopoo and the fan collide, you might want to wear shoes you can run in, in lieu of body armor.     Depending on the size of the dept with whom you will be riding, there is no such thing as a 'safer call.' Make sure you know where you are at all times and what your officer's unit number is in case he goes down and you have to radio in to get help. I know that sounds a little extreme, but a strong mind and a plan can help a lot, especially when lacking body armor.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	No.  We make you sign a waiver and do a quick background check on you.

Besides, Ted Kennedy owns about $1 million in Exxon stock alone.    With Obama's incredible grasp of economics and business, I give it 9 months before the US economy experiences a China Syndrome meltdown that will make the last 6 months look like a minor slowdown.

If he gets the economy back on track, he will have--and deserve-public support. That is his job. Not making a fake show of action to fool people into thinking he's doing something like the Republicans are trying to do with their childish temper tantrums in Congress.    BTW: IF you had paid any attention to the campaign, you'd know most of Obama's support came from ordinary Americans--not the big contributors. I don't know how you missed it.

If we are going to just grant amnesty to illegals - and make no mistake about it, amnesty is what was being offered - we'd just be back in this mess in 20 more years.    To fix the problem, you must first address the problem. That means sealing the borders shut. After the borders are sealed, you have to track down as many illegals as you can and ship 'em back. Now that the borders are sealed, they won't be coming back illegally.    Why would ANYONE support legislation that forgives breaking our laws, that forgives 40% of taxes owed, that forgives identity theft ... YOU would be in jail for that, and yet you support legislation that lets illegals get away with that???    It is a slap in the face to every immigrant and every would-be immigrant who is trying to get into this country legally. Worse yet, it is a slap in the face to the many thousands of immigrants serving in our armed forces to become a CITIZEN and not just be a migrant worker.    Get real.    EDIT: LizzieBeth - I wrote every single Senator and Congressman in Congress and told them they had better not support such useless legislation. If they do, they will soon find out that THIS is a subject they had better deal with in the right manner, or they will soon find themselves out of a job. There are already local officials now out of work because they support amnesty or leniancy toward illegals.

i0vcEyJtaa	People are utterly clueless and stupid. It IS government spending and intervention in the economy, like regulating companies, taxing corporations, raising the minimum wage, outsourcing jobs, and big spending that has brought us on our knees.     Spending on the Iraq war, on welfare, foreign aid, government bureaucracy, education, Medicare, and the bail-outs that has brought the Dollar exhausted, we borrow too much, and at the same time print more from the Federal Reserve that has weakened the Dollar by increasind rapid inflation, and bad financial bubbles that has destroyed the housing market, soon the banking corporations, if not the government.    We have corporations in control of America, the elected officials now ignore the Constitution for money. In order to restore a prosperous America is to cut spending overseas, bring the troops home, stop funding welfare, stop subsidizing companies, withdraw from the useless, expensive UN, NATO, IMF, stop spending on education, medicare, and quit bailing out failed industries. We can save trillions, and pay back our debt, quit printing money, reduce inflation, restore confidence on gold/silver, remove the Federal Reserve, and let capitalism work, we don't need Keynes destroying the markets, because Wall ST and other corporations turn filthy rich during the war, and economic crisis.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Government spending could help get us out of this recession fast. If it's invested in long term things that could benefit us, and our economy in the future.

This is a democrat plan that made it so banks were forced to give home loans to anyone without checking to see if they could afford it.    It's a shame cause now we have to start from scratch again only this time those same people will not be allowed a loan unless they have the means to pay for the home and have the proper documentation.    This was done so America wouldn't look racist - you know some people actually thought that the USA was racist cause they didn't want to give a loan to minority groups  that couldn't afford it.     How did that work out? And why the minority groups still cry racism is beyond me.|`|EPObVPzVaa	They didn't spend any money on it.  They pulled a con on the banks and redistributed their money.

IW3jmnKbaa	Your new here huh?  The constitution was a document that our great forefathers drafted as a way of life and liberty to prevail over an overpowering government,such as the one they broke from, in order to form a more perfect union, with liberty and justice for all.  It was a meticulously thought out blue print of how the government was supposed to work. In essence, it limited government intervention into peoples lives.  But, it got away from us, the government got a hold of it, and destroyed it.  All the "rights" it gave us, are gone forever, just a memory.  The very thing it was designed to stop,stopped it. Without provocation, or aggression on it's part. No, it was killed in the name of freedom, we were once known for our freedom, before the terrorist government took over, they were real clever too, they disguised themselves as American politicians, and with all their terrorist backing, they stole the presidential election, twice. but the second time they put their dastardly plan into full gear, and destroyed America from the inside, all the charges have been set, some have been detonated already, but the final outcome will be the total implosion of America.

5zBEU99kaa	The Arab League has adopted the Saudi Proposal:    The Saudi plan recognizes Israel and offers it permanent peace with all Arab countries in return for an Israeli withdrawal from lands captured in the 1967 war, the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and a just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees.    In the summit's concluding remarks the Arab countries underscored that "they have chosen peace since it is the only strategic option" and proceeded to condemn all forms of terror and violence, and urged all countries to desist from a nuclear arms race. Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal went so far as to say that even if Israel does not accept the initiative immediately the doors for peace and negotiations would be left open.    Israel has taken the same position as Hammas,  a three no approach: no to dividing Jerusalem, no to a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, and no to a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem.    In other words, Israel is not really interested in peace!|`|wxO3eatxaa	Whatever Israeli money wants it to be.|`|3fEiDkL3aa	they want to se israel wiped off the map|`|v1dnnMQuaa	I think, they support the Saudi plan for peace between Israel and Palestine.|`|E0dl34Y7aa	I think they support the Arab position to own all the banks in America, destroy our economy, foreclose on all our homes and whatever else they can do to destroy America in retaliation for America's support of Israel.

1a2c7977e5e8dd3ec77d37f8abf5a078aa	Very good question, but so unfortunate that most answers aren't that good (no offense, you're just not that specific). Anyway, to put it into perspective, it wasn't actually $700 billion, it was $840 billion, the final draft of the bill that was passed added on an extra $140 billion in pork spending. Instead of distributing the money to the failing banks, the government (like everything else the Bush administration did) gave the money to private contractors, in this case, it gave it to specific banks that bid on contracts that would distribute the money. So what you got were banks being the administrators that distributed money for programs that they were eligible for, which would be like giving pot heads zig-zags, black lights and 300 lbs of weed and telling them to not dip their hands in the stash to take more of their own share; it's an huge conflict of interest, especially when you consider it's because of the bank's greed and shortsightedness is what caused the crisis in the first place.    So essentially, you've got banks distributing money amongst themselves with little or no oversight from the government. On top of that, the entire bailout is insult to injury as bank's irresponsibility lead them to lend sour loans, then they got a bailout that we paid for, so they can lend us back our money with interest.

People will try and get over on businesses sometimes with returns that aren't legit (maybe stolen, or they'll come up with some stupid excuse).

Example:  Your credit limit is $200.  Your balance is $190.  Your minimum payment is $25.  They process your payment 1 day after the due date and charge you $50 for late payment and now that brings your balance to $215 which is over your credit limit, so they charge you another $25.  Now your balance is $240 - $25 payment = $215.  Even after your payment, you are still over your credit limit.      The company can post the payment any day they want.  In fact, some companies purposely do this.  You may mail your payment out in plenty of time, but you can't prove when they received it and when they processed it.

How did you give your school the change of address?  Verbally?  Not good enough!  Put it in writing.  Write a letter telling them that your mail is going to an old address.  You have advised them of your new addresss countless times.  If you remember dates, that is even better.  Maybe they made a note in your file but they have not updated their computers or databases and your mail is not getting to you.  It is causing distress and this problem should be corrected immediately.  You would like a written confirmation from someone in authority in the office that this has been taken care of.    Make at least one copy of this letter for your own records.    Next go to the post office.  Fill out a change of address card.  Although you moved a while ago, fill it out now so that any mail that is addressed to you at your old address will be forwarded to your new address.    You can't file criminal charges against your dad.  If it is such a nuisance, he can write the words "not at this address" and stick it back in the mailbox.|`|dH6lBcGlaa	It's not illegal, the ost you could do is file a complaint with the school.

For married adults from most countries it is about 9 years. For Mexico it is currently taking about 17 years, for Philippines about 19 years.      These times are approximately from the time the paperwork is approved by USCIS until a visa becomes available. It takes that long because the total number of visa's are limited, and there is also a limit for each country.|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	Unmarried Sons and Daughters of US Citizen is Family Based 1st Preference and Married Sons and Daughters of US Citizen is Family Based 3rd Preference.

Therefore, it is about 7 years (17 years for Mexican, 16 years for Philippines) of wait.     For FB 3 people who have PD either on or before August 01, 2000 (Oct 08, 1992 for Mexico Citizen and June 01, 1991 for Philippines Citizen).

And the waiting years are after you get your I-130 approval with Priory Date on the notice.

93M8Vccvaa	There are a lot of factors that are involved in bac. How long it had been since the person had eaten. All the persons body type,ie. thin, fat,etc. Everyone has different metabolism.|`|AA11494150	Yes, that is possible.     There are several factors that determine how fast you body gets rid of alcohol, but as a general rule, your body can process about .02 per hour. Therefore, it could be close to zero after four hours.    There is another possibility, also. If you take a breath test immediately after you drink, it can register something called "residual mouth alcohol". It takes about 15 minutes for your mouth tissues to absorb alcohol, anything less and the residual mouth alcohol will create a higher test result.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	no|`|a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	Probably not.  A blood test is almost always higher (more accurate) than a breath test.  Your blood would likely have been .11 or .12 in my experience.  The average adult metabolizes about .016 every hour, depending upon each individual.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Probably not.  The body eliminates alcohol at a rate of approximately 0.0165 an hour.  So at best after four hours your blood test would show a reading of about 0.024 (give or take a little).  Here is another twist for you.  If your alcohol level is increasing at the time of the breath test then it certainly won't show a 0.00 reading since the 0.09 reading would not be your peak alcohol concentration.  Blood tests also tend to read higher then breath tests.      Chemical Analyst  Standardized Field Sobriety Instructor

pcHp7Dgkaa	If you're sponsored by a state government and had lodged your visa application by about mid-January, you can probably expect an answer within the next 2 or 3 weeks. If lodged later than that, it will still be only a short time but no dates have been announced and it will depend on how many applications are in the pipeline.

tfeseeeRaa	Not really.... he was probably an attention seeker.    Democracy doesn't exist..........anywhere.  In fact the very idea  is meaningless.  Jargon. A slogan. Empty. Impossible to apply.    In authoritarian societies dissidents are imprisoned or executed  In democracies they are ignored for as long as possible and then, if the groundswell of opposition starts to become unmanageable, the authorities bend a bit.  An example?  The UK protest about Italians being employed to work on a refinery.  If that protest gets lots of support then changes may well be made.   If not things will just carry on as they are.  The important bit is that ordinary "workers" have been complaining for years that immigration at its current level disadvantages them.  They have been ignored.  Just like I said.

It severely damages our morals by blurring the lines of good and bad. Most people drink under age or smoke pot before finishing college. Since they learn to see this as OK, but illegal, they now find the law isn't right. Since what they have done is a crime, the next crime is much easier to commit. If you have never committed a crime, it's harder to start down the wrong path when things get tough. So this moralistic law, actually promotes behavior worse than the behavior it was intended to stop.

Details of the stimulus plan are still being worked out.|`|y3StvlnHaa	I can't believe some people or so narrow minded as to believe the reason you didn't vote is that you didn't care OR take the time. The truth was it was a struggle for all of us because neither one of them was a prime choice for our country. Considering neither one was even born in the US is rather a joke. But that aside, I read a lot about grants you have to apply for and I am not sure if this is connected to the stimulus plan or just something Obama started. If I actually meet someone who gets a check I will let ya know!
b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Firstly this not an Ancestral property according to Hindu Law ,to be an Ancestral or Copacenary property in a Hindu Family it has to be four generation old,in simple words it should have been purchased & owned by the Great grand father, passed down the generation to the present generation undivided or partitioned. In the present case the very fact the property was purchased by the Grandfather & that too was duly Registered in the Father's name the question this being Ancestral or Copacenary property of the Hindu Family doesn't apply.This property is the property of the father in whose name the Sale deed was duly registered & the father can dispose off the property during his life time & even after his death as he wish to do,his children including the daughter in question has no legal right to prevent him doing so, rather by all her foolish approach towards him now can make him rigid towards her & he may not even give her any share out of the proceeds of the sale of the property which as a father he may have done so not on legal compulsion but for the sake of natural love & affection towards the daughter.|`|61ZtWyqKaa	sorry land belongs to ur dad no law against selling ancestral property       ur dad can do what he likes     maybe u need to sit ur sis down and tell her to stop being selfish and make her understand ur dad needs the money     at the end of the day she can do nothing|`|Az3ZS1ksaa	your elder sister can not get a stay order as there is provision for challenging improper alienation.no question of stay against selling of property by your father.she has no right of raiding any objection.it is not an ancestral property.no body can force some one to register the property in their name.Registration if made without free consent is not valid.|`|9ZeiFzwJaa	i think its ur fathers property not ur sisters she cannot peck her nose in ur fathers property|`|AA11631748	Firstly I would suggest take a legal opinion from an advocate who is well versed with these issues.  Owise you can enter into a release deed ( i.e. if the property is in India).  And tell your sister to either take her share or give your share to you based on the market value.  For a release deed you have to pay 4% stamp duty on the property value and the same has to be registered in the city where the property is.  A Release deed is a deed entered between any 2 parties who are blood relatives or are partners in any property.  She can neither force your parents to register the same in either her name nor in her children's name.  Again I suggest you take some senior lawyer's suggestion who is well versed in property matters before taking any legal action.  Regards  Rajiv

d84d1646c1d27d369f6ba7ea2f38594eaa	It is a good idea, though the GPS should be really inconspicuous. It was used by my team in a war game played in India (Asia). Hope u know where it is!!  We won the game so easily, but in real life the PoW are stripped and searched, so using it in military is out of qustion. Only a crazy general would allow it, but I liked your idea.  Good to have such bright, intelligent questions asked.|`|AA11620807	I think by GPS device you mean a device which would give the soldier's location to friendly forces??  This would also give the location of our forces to our enemy's forces. Along with an exact number of soldiers. It'd be leading our forces into a trap. Then another for rescue forces sent to rescue any stragglers.     It's a good thought, but in reality unworkable. Our pilots and airmen have emergency radios, and radio beacons in aircraft ejection seats. (The seat being seperated from pilot upon ejection won't give away his location).     The rule of thumb: Any system to locate personnel for the U.S. will also locate personnel for the bad guys.|`|AA11491405	And what keeps the enemy from retaining the device, moving the prisoner elsewhere and setting an ambush for his rescuers?|`|0e10d922e17224416236f7fdb7ddb32eaa	yes, dont worry, be happy u r american.|`|AA12062218	Yes it is a good idea, and part 2 of your question I can not legally answer.

AA10167220	Because separation of church and state was never intended by the Framers of the Constitution. In fact, it is never even mentioned in the Constitution. Read the personal letters of the Framers. Without a doubt, they meant for Judeo-Christian ethics to guide the country. In fact, many outright said that without Christian principles guiding the country, it was doomed to ultimately fail.    The First Amendment merely guarantees that the government cannot force you to attend a particular denomination of church - or national religion, if you will. It is a direct result of the persecution of the English who did not belong to the Church of England. It does not prohibit the expression of religion ANYWHERE - public place or otherwise. Why is each session of Congress opened with prayer if there was supposed to be true separation of church and state? Why does the President attend many National Prayer Breakfasts each year? Why does almost every government agency sponsor its own National Prayer Breakfast? Because separation of church and state is not Constitutionally sanctioned.    The First Amendment was meant to protect religion from the government - NOT to protect the government from religion.|`|AA10016396	This is where the phrase comes from:      The Final Letter, as Sent  To messers. Nehemiah Dodge, Ephraim Robbins, & Stephen S. Nelson, a committee of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut.  Gentlemen  The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.  Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.  I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association, assurances of my high respect & esteem.  Th JeffersonJan. 1. 1802.|`|ab685028a5853cf8f238482322afd431aa	I believe that christianity is a huge part of our history in this country. For that reason, and that reason alone I believe that the architect in and around our government buildings should remain.  I also believe that everyone in this country has the right to pray when, where, and to whom they choose without fear of ridicule, prejudism, or persecution.   Just because something has been done one way for hundreds of years does not make it right. There are many things in this countries past that the majority of people once deemed as right or correct. But then someone with a little more intelligence came along and showed them a better way. Ever heard of slavery?   This is the land of the FREE! Noone has a right to push their views and opinions on another.|`|AA12146373	well really america was not suppossed to have an "establishment of religion" that is government can't force it citizens to have a particualer religion, can't make them tithe, can't  make them go to church or believe.    I think too many people are attacking religion in   America.If they don't want to believe fine but don't make it illegal for me to publicly declare my religion...I believe in God and i don't think He should be stripped from every dollar, or schoolbook, or statue.    Every sentence of the constitution haves biblical references because it was founded on the Bible...even though i'm not a (ultra)conservative i think the ACLU should leave religion alone...it keeps people moral(mostly).    If we didn't have the fear of God or Allah or Whatever you believe then what would keep us from robbing banks, killing people, stealing and whatnot. Certainly not your own goodness.  Laws take up what religion can't, it forces people to be accountable and responsible for their acts, Good or Bad|`|AA10915061	I suppose that you, and many like you, would have no problem if a Muslim posted quotes from the koran in the local courthouse. How about if a Hindu led a prayer at a public high school graduation?  Also, maybe you have forgotten or if like me, weren't even born, but there used to be mandated prayer every morning in many public schools. Also, girls could not wear pants. What you are talking about is a step backward, which seems to be fairly typical of conservatives.

We are at war now, and the only thing that will be news to me is when we pull out of this sensless act of violence!  No cheese needed, I don't whine, I scream at unjustified loss of life!!|`|AA10167220	WMDs were initially found in Iraq - the public and the media forgets this. Was it huge stockpiles of them? No, but they were WMDs. Which leads to the question: How many WMDs do you need to qualify to actually have WMDs? In my book, the answer is only one.    Now, we have a case of 500 WMDs found in Iraq since 2003. Were they old? Sure. They were produced before the 1991 Gulf War. Your left-leaning liberals will argue that these had degraded and posed no real danger. Does it matter? Nope. It PROVES that Saddam lied about keeping Weapons of Mass Destruction.    I I think the real question is why aren't the news media outlets - with the notable exception of Fox News - reporting this??? Here are some of the details reported by Congress:    ? Since 2003 Coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent.     ? Despite many efforts to locate and destroy Iraqs pre-Gulf War chemical munitions, filled and unfilled pre-Gulf War chemical munitions are assessed to still exist.     ? Pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons could be sold on the black market. Use of these weapons by terrorists or insurgent groups would have implications for Coalition forces in Iraq. The possibility of use outside Iraq cannot be ruled out.     ? The most likely munitions remaining are sarin and mustard-filled projectiles.     ? The purity of the agent inside the munitions depends on many factors, including the manufacturing process, potential additives, and environmental storage conditions. While agents degrade over time, chemical warfare agents remain hazardous and potentially lethal.     ? It has been reported in open press that insurgents and Iraqi groups desire to acquire and use chemical weapons.

We cannot change the world. We can only maintain what we have worked, struggled, labored and fought for. We can only protect what we have. Many third world countries are poor to our standards, yet they have been that way for millions of years, they will survive, as they always have. Their mortality rate has always been worse than ours, we can't change that. All things can never be equal. There will always be levels and classes of people. No two things are exactly alike. There will always be somebody richer, poorer, blacker, whiter, taller, shorter, prettier, stronger, weaker, healthier, smarter, dumber, wittier, sadder,  happier and braver.

So, if you are so blessed, please by all means help your fellow man, just make sure he is not conning you.  Like the criminals trying to call themselves immigrants in America.  Most immigrants that come here through the proper process, come from nations that little to no wealth, and abuse their citizens in ways like what we see in Iraq.  This is not the case for the illegals of this country that are in mass majority Mexicans.    The crimes these immigrants suffer through at the hands of their own countries is horrible, yet they still migrate here legally.  It is not money that they come for.  It is the voice they have will have in the country they choose to live in.  Mexico one of the largest offenders of illegals is the world's third richest nation.  I've been told by the illegals that just because their country is rich doesn't mean the people are.  Sounds like the same arguement Americans have been saying for about forty years now.  If you want to help a real immigrant, not some criminal trying to hide under the skirts of immigrants, then please by all means do so.  But, first you should now that out of the 20 mil illegals in our country, only 3% come from truly impoverished countries.  The rest come from Mexico, and the Mexican economy is in better shape than the American economy.  Why?  Because our country is supporting millions of their criminals..|`|AA11928637	YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

And isn't the act of ruling (with absolute power) dependent upon the ruler imposing his/her own concept of ethics on the people anyway?

Frodo has just looked into Galadriel's mirror and has come away shaken by what he has seen.  He tells Galadriel to take the ring, it is too great a matter for him to bear.  Here's what she says:    'I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my grasp.    'And now at last it comes ... In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!'    She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. She stood ... seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful.    Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose voice was soft and sad.    'I pass the test,' she said. 'I will diminish and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.'    Later on Sam asks Galadriel to go ahead and take the ring that Frodo has offered, that she would be able to "put things to rights" and that "you'd make some folk pay for their dirty work!"    "I would," she said.  "That is how it would begin.  But it would not stop with that, alas!"      I'm thinking that's how it would start for many of us.  But, like Galadriel, it would not stop with that, alas!|`|fabbcf11b50a8bd33c9209b74f2a514faa	itzfitzhere said it too well|`|AA12214996	Oh hell no.

f9cf888653ba31f81b726d18aebfa2deaa	Political science is the academic subject centering on the relations between governments and other governments, and between governments and peoples.    Political science is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of political systems and political behavior.    Fields and subfields of political science include political theory and philosophy, civics and comparative politics, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, international relations, foreign policy, international law and politics, public administration, administrative behavior, public law, judicial behavior, and politics and public policy. Political science also studies power in international relations and the theory of Great powers and Superpowers.    Political science is methodologically diverse. Approaches to the discipline include classical political philosophy, interpretivism, structuralism, and behavioralism, realism, pluralism, and institutionalism. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, and model building.

74cd317b122a7c3f20d915d1a7efa3f6aa	Unfortunately there is some news that hate groups in this country are on the rise, with all the predictable overblown rhetoric and violence that implies.      It'd be nice if a peaceful, mutually satisfactory resolution can be found to the issue of illegal immigrants already in this country, but I doubt one exists.  I don't see illegal immigrants drifting back to their countries of origin, quietly or otherwise.  But I don't see hate groups rounding them up en masse, either.      The need for cheap labor in the US?  If we can secure our borders to a reasonable degree, the guest worker program would be very welcome by many in this country (including President Bush himself) and presumably by those seeking jobs in this country.      What would REALLY be nice is if we can assist countries that are the source of most of our illegal immigrant population to prosper.  Unfortunately, I'm skeptical that those countries are able to achieve a suitable level of prosperity with or without our help.|`|AA12253571	THere are two separate issues: 1) Closing the borders, 2) deporting illegals.

No politician is going to push the issue hard because with over 10 percent of the registered voters the hispanic vote is too large, add in another 10 percent for other recent immigrants and the number becomes too significant to ignore.  The basic fact is recent immigrants vote at a rate almost 50% higher than other citizen groups.  They won't want to offend the legal citizens who can vote and do vote.  Politics is about getting re-elected, not doing what is right.    Provided however that it did happen, the borderers close and the alliens are deported, then the jobs will follow the labor force... the industry that hasn't already gone to Asia will go to Mexico.  They have the workers and the infrastructure to export all we want to buy.    Much like politicians don't care about you, they care about getting re-elected, business doesn't care about you either, they just want your money.  Since you don't care that most goods are manufactured outside of the USA they know you won't care when the last remaining items are manufactured in Mexico.    Once we have 10% unemployment people will finally be willing to do the work the illegals do, cut lawns, pump gas, work at Wal-Mart because they will be desperate for work.|`|AA10180046	There is already violence in the streets caused by illegals,most prisons are full with illegals that have committed a crime,either to their own,or to American citizens,in an illegal's view,he is better off in this country in prison,than free in their own country|`|AA11933260	Most of the best workers are the illegal immigrants.

Zionism is an extreme movement which claims that Jews deserve all of the Holy Land and will resort to any means violent or otherwise. Not all Jews are Zionists...again they are a small yet extremely vocal minority which appears to be in very influential positions of power. Unfortunately many un-informed idiots see Judaism and Zionism as the same thing.|`|AA11856941	Sounds like you have read absolutely nothing about Palestine, Judaism or the Zionist movement.

To check out what are the zionists/israelies all about. Plz. Kindly check the following link for ready reference    http://www.halturnershow.com/IsraeliAtro...    http://www.fromisraeltolebanon.org    http://www.jerusalemites.org/crimes/crim...    http://www.action-for-un-renewal.org.uk/...    ISRAEL TODAY    Christian and Muslims are seen as subhuman and are forced to use color coded license plates that easily identify them as non-Jewish. Palestinians are forced to use different roads, sidewalks and neighborhoods from their Jewish counterparts primarily to prevent terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens. In actuality it was yet another form of control and humiliation designed to wear down and demoralize the Palestinian people. 93% of Israel is off limits to non-Jewish residents...though exceptions are made for tourists.  Israel an American Value?   Torture and summary executions were not American values until we prostituted ourselves for the sake of Israel, thus adopting their policies, programs and procedures, despite the conflicts with our constitution and stated principles.  Though these actions violate every principle the United States is founded on, we support and protect these policies in Israel and engage in them in Iraq and Afghanistan making the term, "American values" the ultimate oxymoron.  Some of their most beloved Zionist leader quotes:  1. "There is a huge gap between us (Jews) and our enemies not just in ability but in morality, culture, sanctity of life, and conscience. They are our neighbors here, but it seems as if at a distance of a few hundred meters away, there are people who do not belong to our continent, to our world, but actually belong to a different galaxy." Israeli president Moshe Katsav. The Jerusalem Post, May 10, 2001   2. "The Palestinians are like crocodiles, the more you give them meat, they want more".... Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel at the time - August 28, 2000. Reported in the Jerusalem Post August 30, 2000  3. " [The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs." Menahim Begin, speech to the Knesset, quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, "Begin and the Beasts". New Statesman, 25 June 1982.  4. "The Palestinians" would be crushed like grasshoppers ... heads smashed against the boulders and walls." " Isreali Prime Minister (at the time) in a speech to Jewish settlers New York Times April 1, 1988  5. "When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle." Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983.  6. "How can we return the occupied territories? There is nobody to return them to." Golda Maier, March 8, 1969.  7. "There was no such thing as Palestinians, they never existed." Golda Maier Israeli Prime Minister June 15, 1969  8. "The thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us in June 1967 and that Israel was fighting for its physical existence is only bluff, which was born and developed after the war." Israeli General Matityahu Peled, Ha'aretz, 19 March 1972.  9. David Ben Gurion (the first Israeli Prime Minister): "If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti - Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault ? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?" Quoted by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Jewish Paradox), pp121.  10. Ben Gurion also warned in 1948 : "We must do everything to insure they ( the Palestinians) never do return." Assuring his fellow Zionists that Palestinians will never come back to their homes. "The old will die and the young will forget."  11. "We have to kill all the Palestinians unless they are resigned to live here as slaves." Chairman Heilbrun of the Committee for the Re-election of General Shlomo Lahat, the mayor of Tel Aviv, October 1983.b  12. "Every time we do something you tell me America will do this and will do that . . . I want to tell you something very clear: Don't worry about American pressure on Israel. We, the Jewish people, control America, and the Americans know it." - Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, October 3, 2001, to Shimon Peres, as reported on Kol Yisrael radio. 13. "We declare openly that the Arabs have no right to settle on even one centimeter of Eretz Israel... Force is all they do or ever will understand. We shall use the ultimate force until the Palestinians come crawling to us on all fours." Rafael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces - Gad Becker, Yediot Ahronot 13 April 1983, New York Times 14 April 1983.  14. "We must do everything to ensure they [the Palestinian refugees] never do return" David Ben-Gurion, in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar's Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 157.  15. "We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai."

AA11511988	Every single human alive (except for the 'Corkys' of the world) is biased and prejudiced and discriminatory. These are not necessarily bad things, but they can be. In actuality, these are really neutral things; to be bad, they have to be used wrongly.    We are all prejudiced and biased against or for different types of people - how they act, how they dress, how they speak, what they say. Let's not kid ourselves and pretend we are not. A little rigorous self-honesty is required.    But I truly avoid people who say they have no prejudices or biases - they are lying. Those who think prejudice or bias can be eliminated are idealists living in some fantasyland, whose actions can actually be more harmful than if they acknowledged real human nature.    But to listen to an opposite point of view, there must be a reasonable meeting ground for ideas. No name-calling or vitriol.

I'm not able to catch all of the questions right now, but I'm glad I didn't miss this one.  And not to let you down:    Sure glad your friend took advantage of the expensive education funded at the expense of our children.....    And Mexico has private schools.  If you measured our private school children against theirs you might get a different result.    I don't understand why you missed me.  You are proving my point that the LAUSD with such a huge per centage of illegal immigrant children and children of illegal immigrants really sucks as far as education is concerned.  That is why we need our schools back.    Since universal education is not given in Mexico due to its great expense, if you took our average 15 year old and measured their education against an average 15 year old from Mexico (only educated to the extent that average 15 year old would be educated) things might slant in our favor.    Look, education is an argument you lose.  Illegals speak two languages because we pay to teach them two .  As a result have no money for second languages for our own children.      If I saw the PBS study I could probably debunk it.  If a school was in an area with low population and so got no share of the funds and now gets a bigger piece of the pie, all I can say is that each slice is now much smaller.    Many schools weren't even built before the illegals, since we didn't have nearly so many children.  Those have been funded from scratch.  The fact that we have to pay so much more money than we get the benefit of for our own children is not a point in your favor.  Poor people, even if they pay all taxes, do not pay more than a tiny fraction of their education costs.  The rest of us do.    Look, you have better arguments.  Like, we don't feel bad about deporting illegals only because we don't know who they are, and once they had faces, we would feel differently.    You lose on education.  I wish you didn't  --------  Response:  No schools would have been needed without the additional people.  Also WE are the ones who pay for the schools.  I do not discount the taxes some illegal immigrants pay, those are taken into account.  Poor people who take deductions simply don't pay that much tax, and schools are expensive.  ESL is hugely expensive, as well.|`|03c3881fd24bfb93aa59a952408c38d7aa	Your post is entirely fiction.

Aung is a heroic woman who has endured years of punishments and confinements in her struggle to win freedom for her people from the brutal dictatorship in Burma.    The rest of the world should be learning a lesson in courage and humility from her.|`|3c95c0308748e61cc3ae8d7d98b38153aa	Yes , I have heard about her, an opposition leader that fights for human rights, and is always in home arrest ( at least last decade of two).  Still is in house arrest,   The country is ruled by military hunta.  These are infos, that I new without the net.   Tough litle woman.  I hope her plans and fight will sometime in the future see their fruition and success.|`|AA11593605	Yeah Aung San suu kyi is a democracy activist in burma. She has been fighting activily for restoration of democracy in burma for more than 20 years. She is currently under house arrest.    But since Myanmar is a memeber of Asean therefore the ruling junta military force is under great pressure from member nations for democracy.

I have been to Lawton and it's a nice town. If you are curious what it is like, try going to mapquest.com and looking at it. They usually have different restaurants and places to go on there too. Try a Yahoo search. Oh, and my husband's best friend has 2 children and another on the way. She says it's not so bad. It's something you get used to when you're married to a military man.

Mas, se vc n?o participa da "boquinha" do PT, se vc n?o integra o "esquema" do PT, N?O vote no Lula, vote no melhor ou , especialmente no segundo turno, no "menos pior".    O PT n?o criou a corrup??o, ela deve existir desde que o homem  homem. Mas os governos petistas a institucionalizaram, deram-lhe express?o jamais vista. O PT planejou-a, organizou-a, sistematizou-a e implantou-a em todos os escal?es da administra??o. A corrup??o do mensal?o n?o tem precedentes na histria da Humanidade. Envergonha o Brasil.    A CORRUP??O INSTITUCIONALIZADA PELO PT, mais do que desmoralizar os envolvidos perante os demais, RETIRA-LHES O PRPRIO CENSO MORAL, A CAPACIDADE DE DIFERENCIAR O HONESTO DO DESONESTO, TRANSFORMA-OS EM INDIVDUOS INDIGNOS, IMPOSSIBILITA-OS DE VIVER ENTRE PESSOAS PROBAS.    O PT roubou, deixou roubar e estimulou o roubo, como mostraram claramente vrias CPIs.    Por essas raz?es, Lula  o pior candidato. Lula, NUNCA MAIS.    A meu ver, trs candidatos renem condi??es mnimas para serem eleitos, Cristv?o Buarque, Geraldo Alckmin e Helosa Helena.    Helosa Helena tem contra si a inexperincia administrativa; Cristv?o Buarque, a baixa densidade eleitoral. Votando nele corre-se o risco de permitir a elei?ao de Lula no primeiro turno.

Lets try the straightforward answer - because it is wrong. It is an unnatural act. It is deviant behavior.    Same reasons why you cant have sex with corpses. Or masturbate in public. Or defecate on someone's car simply because you think it would be funny.    It has nothing to do with "puritans" trying to keep you from having "fun" - if something that depraved can be called fun. It has to do with acceptable behaviors in a society. Sex with animals is offensive to normal people. You might not find anything wrong with it, but the vast majority of normal people do, hence it is not tolerated by society.|`|e74edec994faf8d0880e6df4b7eaf655aa	It's just wrong and it's really gross that's why.

As we the citizens are required more and more often to change our ways to appease someone else and not the other way around as it should be, I think America is being assimilated.  Like the Borg say, "Resistance is futile!"  Something needs to be done to stop all this nonsense.|`|d3920179c0c6134de7306d62c2807d1faa	Assimilating is something that every new immigrant takes on, over time.  America is a "melting-pot," blending cultures even if ethnicities don't always mix.  We have a tsunami-size influx of Latino immigrants, sure, illegal, many are.  They don't have an agenda to "assimilate."  I don't hate them, especially not for their goals of a better life, but we need to stop this wave, not hate them or their culture.|`|6eb87855821d14d5952067cc42e0c2d8aa	Well, we all know what happens when you add too much of one ingredient into the melting pot...|`|80cfe9b92d31ebf5520e2e730f7821a1aa	Don't you know?

It is high time to dismantle UNO and create New World Organization (NWO).  The UNO is outdated as it does not have India, Japan, Germany and Brazil as Permanent Members of the Security Council.  The UNO has outlived its utility in 21st Century, it is prudent to wind it up and establish a NEW WORLD ORGANIZATION (NWO).   The world system of the 21st Century shall be Colonial world Order. Just as 25 Countries joined European Union, similarly all countries of Asia and Africa should join the Afro-Asian Union led by India and China. all countries of South America, Central America should join into a South American Union.   UNO represent the interests of Nation-states, which became outdated in the 21st Century. More than 120 countries shall lose their independence and sovereignty before 2025 AD.    The UNO has become defunct and dysfunctional. The UNO should be disbanded and a New World Organization (NWO) should be formed.   The UNO should convene an International Conference similar to the 1885 Partition of Africa Conference and the purpose of the Conference should be to Partition OPEC member states into Colonial spheres of influence of great powers, namely, USA, India, China, Europe, Japan and Russia.   The UNO should legitimize Colonial Empires and partition OPEC nations, and Third World nations into colonial spheres of influence of 8 Great Powers.  It was a mistake to allow the independence of so many countries in Asia and Africa. there should be no more than 10 independent countries in the world, rest of the nation states should become colonies of the Great Powers.  UNO should remain relevant during the outbreak of the Third World War and help usher in a New Age of Colonial Empires.

I have been reported for gaming for points when I answer their stupid racist questions. I think that they are doing more of a service to the anti illegal side when they play the race card. It proves how ignorant they are. They provide links to blogs and when a link is provided for them with actual facts, they either have it removed or say something like this."

c9914b8c83d88d6de46b41b33cc1e38eaa	Eu sempre fui e continuo sendo um admirador do FHC , talvez o melhor presidente que o Brasil j teve , por sua enorme capacidade analtica , e principalmente por implementar polticas   governamentais de longo prazo , respeitando o processo democrtico , tornando-as irreversveis .

Porm , acho que FHC , errou , ao dizer que a Sociedade Brasileira se encontra anestesiada , perdeu sua capacidade de se indignar. Seria mais conveniente, dizer que uma grande parcela da Sociedade jamais se indignou , quanto as anomalias  polticas e econ?micas que se verificaram e se verificam no Brasil.

Or you can go online to the service of your choice's webpage (they all have one) and you can ask for the real scoop. Or you can just call any recruiter and ask them.     The military does offer LASIK eye surgery once you're in, for free. Saves them the price of providing you glasses for the life of your career.    Those languages are not in real high demand right now in the milary, but once conflict starts in the former European colonies in Africa, you'll be right there where they need you.

O PT n?o criou a corrup??o, ela deve existir desde que o homem  homem. Mas os governos petistas a institucionalizaram, deram-lhe express?o jamais vista. O PT planejou-a, organizou-a, sistematizou-a e implantou-a em todos os escal?es da administra??o. A corrup??o do mensal?o n?o tem precedentes na histria da Humanidade. Envergonha o Brasil.    A CORRUP??O INSTITUCIONALIZADA PELO PT, mais do que desmoralizar os envolvidos perante os demais, RETIRA-LHES O PRPRIO CENSO MORAL, A CAPACIDADE DE DIFERENCIAR O HONESTO DO DESONESTO, TRANSFORMA-OS EM INDIVDUOS INDIGNOS, IMPOSSIBILITA-OS DE VIVER ENTRE PESSOAS PROBAS.    O PT roubou, deixou roubar e estimulou o roubo, como mostraram claramente vrias CPIs.    Por essas raz?es, Lula  o pior candidato. Lula, NUNCA MAIS.    A meu ver, trs candidatos renem condi??es mnimas para serem eleitos, Cristv?o Buarque, Geraldo Alckmin e Helosa Helena.    Helosa Helena tem contra si a inexperincia administrativa; Cristv?o Buarque, a baixa densidade eleitoral. Votando nele corre-se o risco de permitir a elei?ao de Lula no primeiro turno. Geraldo Alckmin, alm de ter feito bom governo em S?o Paulo e de ter passado limpo,  o nico que elimina o risco de Lula eleger-se no primeiro turno.

b2bc26ed18e055c1237dc7fc798d39ecaa	Sure we can be brainwashed. Teach a child from the time they are young that representatives are chosen by the people, and this becomes a self-evident truth (NEVER questioned) so long as he/she see's people going to the polls every election cycle.    Never mind the fact that the child never learns that those "representatives" are selected from the same small group of likeminded individuals who purport to represent different political views. When the child reaches maturity, he/she is convinced that each vote is important when in reality, the group in control of the process has their their candidates representing both sides, so they are gaurunteed to be the winner no matter how the voting results.    It's a form of brainwashing.    Edited to add: FYI, The US was never a Democracy and never should be one. It's a Representative Republic. Our reps are elected in a democratic fashion, but our nation is led by chosen representatives (supposedly), not by the will of the majority.|`|6f643b0d563afd823e2f88a4db1213b2aa	Freedom is an illusion. It is a state of mind, not a state of being. It is perfectly posisble for citizens of any state to be under the illusion that their lives are more free than they actually are - and it is the role of government to create and sustain that illusion, for fear of revolution and loss of power.|`|44278221d0b910f7e2de63fcd827b10eaa	You should read up about Karl Marx and Marxism.

Thjat was a scare tactic created during the cold war.  We are human beings and have the power over our own actions, especially when it comes to life and death.    I personally, and I am sure others will agree, make decisions based on reason and heart.  Not because I went to a certain school or church.  Christians, Muslims and Atheists would all unite to tell you that none of these bad things happening are down to brainwashing.|`|f96fa952c2db62fce09659104dfe86a9aa	Absolutely.  The way they do this is by limiting information, thus limiting knowledge of choice.  "abstainence only" programs are a good example.  Imbedded journalism is the best.  By controlling what the press can report, they control what information you can see, and therefore limit your very perception of choices.    Another way is the government publically saying it does one thing (like abiding by the constitution) and privately doing another (like domestic spying).|`|a5a6b301dc928e00c4b5759bcc93265caa	Education has nothing to do with brainwashing...afterall education in UK and USA have nothing to do with the emotional need of level of freedom....democracy is the best thing ever happened to mankind|`|4183baad154db046297159bca41c47e3aa	"Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time"    Winston Churchill|`|b4d8b5a9f70163970f356b9f7f42d70eaa	surely not|`|37373156ceb469ecc5edbb2ce042631caa	freedom what freedom?|`|86361828859c11415a0a24286682949baa	Yeah, I like that.

We wouldn't have to be in war if the Bush family would leave the politics to the grown ups. America, the land of the free and the home of the brave? Yeah, the troops are brave, but they wouldn't have to be overseas if Bush didn't like to start wars that are none of US business.   I don't know much about CA state government because I don't live there, but why, oh why did The Terminator get elected?
6a525a0d72bf0f0df18c005121c71ebdaa	Hopefully this will spell it out for Do You Really Care and other Bush supporters who just don't get the point.    I am a liberal (no, I am not ashamed to say that I am one) who, like many other Americans, saw the World Trade Center towers go down on TV on the morning of September 11, 2001. When President Bush officially declared the beginning of the war on terror, I said to myself, "He's in full President mode now. Nobody will be making fun of the way he talks for a long, long time. Not as long as we're at war with the people who are at war with us. He's done what any real leader would do and stepped up to the plate to defend our country."    When we invaded Afghanistan to crush the Taliban and take out Osama bin Laden, I supported the President's decision, as I'm sure many others did.    In 2003, when the run-up to the Iraq war began, Colin Powell went to the U.N. and said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and needed to be removed from power, and I believed him. Saddam Hussein is one of the villainous men ever to rule any country in the world. I'm glad we took him out.    At the same time, I saw France, Russia, Germany, and China (all of which were part of the coalition that executed Operation Desert Storm in 1991) refuse to join what has become known as the Coalition of the Willing, wondering why we didn't wait for the U.N. weapons inspectors to finish the job they were asked to do, and wondering why we were in such a hurry to go to war. Because of this, our relationships with them became strained, France and Germany much more so than others (think "Freedom Fries" and Gerhard Schroeder's re-election campaign). At home and around the world, thousands of people were protesting the decision to go to war, and the President ignored them. The Dixie Chicks, who until then had been a bestselling country group, came under fire for saying that they were ashamed that the President is from Texas. These incidents were some of the first of many which prove that this administration despises dissenting opinions. At this point in time, if you were an American and you questioned Bush's Iraq policy, you were an unpatriotic, America-hating liberal.    On May 1, 2003, when the President stood aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln wearing combat gear, in front of a banner, with the words "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" in big bold letters on it, he declared that major combat operations in Iraq were over. To anyone watching this speech, as I happened to be, it seemed to be a clear sign that the war would be coming to an end, our troops would be coming home soon with minimal casualties, and President Bush could chalk this one up as a major victory in the war on terror, and go down in history as one of our country's greatest leaders.    As I continued to watch events unfold in the weeks, months, and years ahead, it became clear to me that none of the above would truly come to pass. As a result, my opinion of the President and his administration changed, for the following reasons, both foreign and domestic.    1. Bush declared victory on May 1, 2003, yet the followers of people like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Muqtada al-Sadr, and Saddam loyalists have continued the war.    2. The weapons of mass destruction which the Bush administration used as justification for going to war have not been found. At least two Chief U.N. weapons inspectors have gone to Iraq to put this in writing. (I myself believe that Saddam did in fact have WMD's, but the evidence appears to suggest that he didn't have them where we were told he had them).    3. Bush chose to ignore tactical plans drawn up by the State Department, as well as warnings that an insurgency of the sort we see in Iraq today, would rise up. Instead, he and Dick Cheney believed Ahmed Chalabi when he said that our troops would be greeted as liberators when Baghdad fell (I believe his words were "with candy and flowers"). This has since been proven not to be true.     4. The 9/11 Comission has officially proven that Saddam Hussein's regime had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Nor was there even a single Iraqi hijacker on any of the four planes. The majority of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, which tends to beg the question of why we haven't done anything about their government. Yet the Bush administration has consistently tied Iraq and 9/11 together, in the face of so much evidence of no connection.  One of the reasons why we and our allies often disagree on this point is because Bush looks at Iraq and the War on Terror as two parts of one giant war.  Everyone else looks at Iraq and the War on Terror as two seperate wars.    5. By the time we realized that we didn't have enough troops on the ground to bring the insurgency under control, it was already too late.    6. During the 2004 campaign season, a spate of books came out which contradicted everything that we had been told about what we were going to do in Iraq and why. See, for example, "Against All Enemies", by Richard A. Clarke, or "Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them", by Al Franken.    7. Needless to say, I voted for John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election. I became 100% resolute in my decision after Vice-President Cheney gave a speech in September of that year designed to blame Kerry and anyone who voted for him for the next 9/11-type terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Bush won a second term anyway.    8. The Valerie Plame case has become a high-profile example of what the Bush Administration does to people who don't agree with everything they do.    9. In 2005, the Terri Schiavo debacle exposed the right wing of the Republican party for what it really is, and convinced me that as long as Christian conservatives are in control of the party, the country is in serious danger of becoming the theocracy that right now Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and many others like him c|`|AA10563408	I don't know how he is able to sleep - his comment today was that there is "no way" that we are going to pull out.

They are over there fighting because they chose to.  The members of the armed forces have my utmost respect.  President Bush is doing what he thinks is right, he has that right because he is our president.  He was elected into that office by our fellow Americans and he deserves to be there.  I suggest that instead of ripping on the president, try supporting him because he is the leader of the greatest nation in the world.  Like it or not, it isn't up to you to be high and mighty because it isn't you over there dying, you are here complaining.  Get a life and realize that putting down our President isn't going to change a damn thing!        P.S.  I have known a few soldiers that have been to Iraq and they say that what they were doing over there was helping the people that couldn't help themselves.  They told me that they made a huge impact on the Iraqi people and that they could definitely see a vast improvement in the lives of the Iraqi people that they helped to save!

71a103ea014c120e85206d0bd7888680aa	Meu amigo !  Se curso universitrio fosse t?o importante assim o Brasil j seria a primeira potncia mundial. At onde eu sei todos os nossos presidentes tinham curso universitrio e a maioria avassaladora dos nossos parlamentares dem.    O Slvio Santos entende de eletr?nica ?  Voce dirige ?  Se sim, entende de mecanica ?    Um presidente Preside, n?o executa.    O mecanico conserta o carro mas quem determina para onde o carro vai  o motorista.    Quem te ensinou a falar, antes de ir para a escola ?  Ningum, voce aprendeu sozinho. Quem te ensinou a andar ?  Por a vai.    Cabe ainda acrescentar que no mundo de hoje na maioria dos cursos universitrios muito do que voce aprende no primeiro ano j ficou obsoleto quando voce termina o curso. Portanto algum leigo que se mantm atualizado, com o passar do tempo sabe muito mais que um graduado que se acomodou.    O mais importante num poltico  a sua sensibilidade, sua idoneidade e sua boa inten??o. Se ele n?o tiver isso, tor?o para que seja incompetente pois, nesse caso, quanto maior for sua competncia maior ser o desastre para a na??o. Competente  o que sabe fazer algo bem feito, inclusive as coisas ruins, n?o  necessariamente um cara bom. Eu adoraria que as savas, os cupins, os ratos, etc ....   n?o fossem competentes nem trabalhadores. Penso o mesmo da maioria dos polticos.|`|a35edecf0db1bdf70071bf395d749d7eaa	Deveria ser uma obrigatoriedade..|`|4b03558decfaf6ed50599945ab9afe50aa	Eu acho que toda a pessoa que se candidatasse a um cargo poltico deveria ter no mnimo um curso superior e falar no mnimo dois idiomas e ser feita avalia??o dos seus bens e de sua conduta.ai sim o povo saberia em quem estaria votando.|`|9c2ffc469b0987526f53ad95f25135c5aa	Quando se fala de governo devemos analisar a base do sistema poltico em que vivemos, qual seja, uma democracia. Simplificando, no Brasil temos 3 poderes, sendo que dois deles possuem cargos com caraterstica de elegibilidade, quais sejam, o Executivo e o Legislativo. Diferentemente dos EUA, s pra citar um exemplo, n?o h aqui elei??es para cargos no Judicirio. Ent?o, ns temos o poder de atravs do voto constituir periodicamente os poderes responsveis pela administra??o do Estado e pela cria??o de leis. Na minha opini?o para cargos Executivos n?o deveria existir esse "curso universitrio", pois o Presidente, os Governadores e os Prefeitos s?o bem acessorados quando desejam que seja assim. O governo deles passa a ser mais de prioridades do que de mera administra??o, ou seja, basta eles determinarem algo que ser feito por uma pessoa com conhecimento na rea - Ministros, Secretrios etc. Agora para cargos no Legislativo sim, deveria haver um preparo para o bom desempenho do cargo. Como pode um deputado, Estadual ou Federal, legislar sem ao menos conhecer o bsico sobre leis? No caso do Senado o problema  menos pior, mas tambm  desolador. O Brasil est como est muito mais por culpa do Legislativo do que por culpa do Executivo, at porque  na Camara onde se concentra os maiores desperdcios de dinheiro pblico e a maior parte da corrup??o na esfera federal. Bom, est  minha opini?o...|`|abc3e5416c771658d769f3692c80f642aa	Curso universitrio para polticos... hummmm...sei n?o mas, se todo poltico tivesse mais estudo seria mais justo.

Ent?o, por que os "polticos" n?o?????|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	com certeza!!!!!!!  e de preferencia de no menos 5 anos...  com aulas de ingles e outras linguas|`|f60d4360624725ec15928d6d1dea7647aa	Back.. olhe s.

Isso pra provar a capacidade do candidato    Em vagas que exigem curso superior, alm de tudo tem que saber muito, provar que sabe e dar todos os exemplos possveis disso. Fora as matrias, que agora s?o mais cascudas ainda... Isso pra provar a capacidade do candidato    Agora pro cara ser ELEITO, as qualifica??es s?o mnimas.. nem precisa ter tido alguma experiencia na vida pblica, conta apenas alguma coisa que ele tenha feito na privada ( em duplo sentido mesmo).  Isso pra provar a INCAPACIDADE de seus eleitores....    Sou a favor do poltico profissional mesmo, de carreira, que tenha tido experiencias bem sucedidas em outros cargos abaixo daquele que ele quer ocupar.

If your MOS is small, like mine was, your more than likely not going anywhere.  Enjoy it while your there, your only going to be there for three years anyways, more than likely.  Try the other stuff, but don't make life hard for yourself either by trying to claw your way out of that unit, give it a couple months, see what happens.

Japan is the most culturally diverse country in Asia.  Take the time to know it, it's people, it's cities and towns, and it's language.

They needed someone of your specialty in Japan, and they tasked you to fill the slot.  Chin up, be a good soldier and do your tour, then come home to us!  There is always something worthwhile at every station.  It's absolutely what you make of it.  Find a group of friends and make it good.  Enjoy yourself and come home soon.    p.s., I hear there's superb scuba diving around Japan.  Maybe take this opportunity to get certified.  Enjoy the culture.

I certainly did not want to be in Japan, it was no where near any list I ever had in my entire life.  But I ended up having a great time, made lots of good friends that I even communicate with to this day and bought a kick butt stereo!  the time will fly by, and you can take hops to see other places.

9746cbf8f8062b423a5addfd7fe0240faa	Sam:    Here is the deal.  I agree with the sentiment, but there is a big factor stopping most countries from recognizing Somaliland.  If Somaliland were recognized, it would provide an incentive for other groups in Africa to secede.  In the case of Somaliland, this is not such a bad thing.  In the case of many other areas (where the drive to split is purely ethnic or religious) it can be a bad thing.    In the 1950s and 60s, when most African countries gained independence, they had to deal with the arbitrary boundaries drawn by the colonial powers (hence all the straight lines on the African map).  Instead of redrawing the map to reflect demographic reality, African leaders ultimately agreed to keep the colonial boundaries (with some limited exceptions).  The leaders recognized the chaos that would ensue if the entire map were redrawn.  Many of the resulting states would not be viable, even by regional standards.    Long story short, an independent Somaliland would set a bad precedent.  It is not a fun reality, but it could be the lesser of two evils.      Sorry that so many people doubt that Somaliland really exists.  It is sad.  Your question is a very good one.|`|AA11863637	i think you made this up...|`|AA10428762	Well for one thing, I've never heard of Somaliland. The American media is horrible about broadcasting any kind of good news, so the first thing you should do is work to bring your country's existance to light.

Get your government to send envoys to the UN and powerful nations (not just Western ones, either, send people to China, Japan, and India). Get the word out and let's see if anything happens!    Good luck!|`|c972669815604ebab8ec7008f59a9225aa	It's the first time I hear about it.

Let the Arabs with all the $$$ help their Muslim brothers they profess so much support for, better yet let all the masquerading Islamic charity groups in this country give them $$$ instead of buying cell phones for IEDs and suicide bombers in Iraq and Palestine.

abe1bed3a960ac905cbcdc4f3acb42f3aa	yes, there should be no vetos but that wouldn't really work. No one would give up that kind of power.    What they should do is give each country a certain number of 'votes' that can be applied to each issues. The votes can be awarded to countries through certain criteria: Population, GDP and average quality of life for it's citzens.    So a country with high population, GDP and quality of life would have more weight to influnce decisions. The US will a decently high population a strong GDP and high quality of life would have a lot of say (votes) in the UN compared to say North Korea. But it's still possible for the rest of the world to have it's say.

They talk a lot, but never take any action, and on the rare occasion that they do, the lousy incompetents only make things worse. If they had done their job right and enforced their resolutions, the U.S. would not be in Iraq right now!    I say the U.S. should pull out of the U.N.  We need to stop funding and supporting an organization that allows Communists and dictators to have authority over us.    I'm not sure I like your idea of a replacement though.  What you're describing there is the League of Nations, and that didn't last very long for the very reason of no veto power.  Why go backwards?

3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	I think grants are a wonderful idea. I do agree that it seems like some kids are just there to party and play with the free money. Keep in mind that those are usually the ones who drop out or don't even get ahead in life. Taking away grants and federal help for those who are honestly trying I think would be completely wrong! What about all those who didn't grow up with all of the benefits that some do? Are you supposed to just cast those people aside and say no to them? What about those trying to do what they dreamed of all their lives and finally getting that chance to go back and try it? Can you say no to them? And although I can see where you might think that the more college grads there are, the less jobs there will be, I have to disagree with you there as well. Those who go forth are usually the ones to create more jobs for people who need them. If you don't like the social life of your college, you don't have to be involved. I hope you might change your aspect on this. Grants are wonderful for the people who actually need them. Good Luck and Happy Studying!|`|e9fcc3005143d4e931a3524100e49114aa	Education is the key out of poverty.  To only allow the wealthy to become educated would only broaden the gap between rich and poor.  I am a grant student at community college.  I would not be in school if this was not available.  I am a good student, as well as a stay at home mom and wife.  I am not dancing outside at school to spanish music.  I go to class and then come home and cook dinner for my family.  Also, there is a great deal more to learn at college than is provided in the classroom.  That is why it is called the "college experience".  A person becomes exposed to things outside of their immediate sphere.  They learn independence etc, etc, etc.  Historically colleges have been the birth places of new ideas, revolutions and incredible artistic and philisophical developments.  Not just studying books, but life and experience.  That is why many employers require a college degree, but not a particular major.  If the government stayed out of education it would only benefit you.  Probably a wasp male from a wealthy family.  The rest of the country would suffer so would the experience of college.  Many of the grant students work harder than you can imagine.  Plus music and dancing certainly has nothing to do with education.|`|60c087fe04bd97f3d4aaad3f74237995aa	Hey, I know there is a lot of confusion over college grants. If you check http://www.collegefunder.org you can see what one guy did to get over $40K in college grants.    Think about it and check out that site for sure.|`|AA10515896	So, your objective to college is that some people don't study when they are there? The one social program that almost everyone can agree on is education. Just because some people waste that, doesn't mean the government should stay out.    Now, if you want to change the laws so that the money is a grant if you get certain grades, but must be paid back as a loan if you flunk out, that would make the program better and encourage education.

However, such cases are generally hard to prove and in nearly every case would require the the confession of either the payee or payor, or both.  To the point, an anonymous complaint to the authorities would likely uncover anything unless one of the two confessed.  Finally, the scope and scale of any probe would likely deal with the estimated tax evasion, given that most regulating bodies are busy trying to catch the biggest of the fish.

No s si te han EXPLICADO LO QUE ES EL COMUNISMO.   Bueno el Comunismo se cree que es algo TOPICO. NINGUN PAS, por muy COMUNISTA QUE DIGA QUE ES, ha logrado ese ltimo paso que es el siguiente al SOCIALISMO.    -Comunismo, movimiento e ideologa que tienden a crear sociedades ECONMICAMENTE IGUALITARIAS.   -El socialismo es una denominacin genrica de un conjunto de teoras socio-econmicas, ideologas y prcticas polticas que postulan la abolicin de las desigualdades econmicas, sociales y polticas entre las clases sociales    El comunismo y EL socialismo son muy parecidos. La diferencia es que en el SOCIALISMO existe todava lo que es la PROPIEDAD PRIVADA y LA LUCHA DE CLASES.    Lo que se vive en CUBA es un SOCIALISMO.    La gente se va de CUBA porque tiene la mentalidad CAPITALISTA EN LA MENTE. Quieren ser ricos (?y quien no verdad?), vivir el mal llamado SUE?O AMERICANO.Es muy pero muy dificil SER SOLIDARIO CON UN IDEAL, CUANDO EL DINERO EST EN TU MENTE.  Logicamente, no todos van a pensar de la misma forma en que PIENSA EL 90% DE PERSONAS EN CUBA.No a todos les interesa el BIENESTAR DE TODOS. No a todos les va a parecer esa LOCAS IDEAS DE FIDEL DE VIVIR EN IGUALDAD,No a todos les gusta que TODOS VIVAN CON DIGNIDAD, No a todos les gusta el bien comn.No todos se sacrificarian por otros. No todos COMPARTIRIAN SUS BIENES PARA QUE OTRO PUEDA COMER TAMBIN, ?o si? ?Lo haras vos? O todos en la mesa o todos en el suelo.    Nos han creado un ideal individualista y mezquino de pasar sobre quien sea con tal de lograr el exito (dinero)    Un buen ejemplo sera mi pas, El Salvador.  con un TLC, con una DOLARIZACIN, SIN EMBARGO ECONOMICO, con un espacio GEOGRFICO REDUCIDO... es el nmero 104 segn el PNUD. O sea... el CAPITALISMO ahoga al trabajador creando un caos en el sistema econmico de los pases; creando ms delincuencia (El Salvador el pas MS VIOLENTO DE AMERICA LATINA, 14 muertos diarios, y no hay ya guerra civil como en Colombia), Y CON UNA SUMATORIA DE POBREZA RELATIVA, MS POBREZA ABSOLUTA, dando un resultado de 73% de POBREZA EN EL SALVADOR (datos de la DIGESTYC, institucin del gobierno salvadore?o)    En cambio CUBA con un embargo econmico (pura arbitrariedad gringa) y a pesar de esto es el pas nmero 52 (ARRIBA DE MEXICO SEGN EL PNUD, Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo) de los 170 pases con ms desarrollo humano en el mundo (Mejor Salud, Mejor Educacin, Mejor Sistema Electoral, Mejor Vivienda (digna, no palacios), Mejores ATLETAS, Y UN 1% de analfabetismo.     Mi pas (Capitalista) Cuba (Socialista, no Comunista; todava)    Pero la pregunta sera ?Por qu no se ido TODA la gente de CUBA, si CUBA est tan mal?    Por qu ven mal a FDEL? ... ?Porque no cumple con los designios de los EE.UU, y la FAUNA DE CUBANOS EN MIAMI?? y porque se ha mantenido como presidente haciendo a un lado el sistema electoral tradicional y haciendo plebiscitos ms que llamando a elecciones generales? ?y porque reform la constitucin para mejorar el funcionamiento del gobierno desde su gestin?    O sea... qu tiene de malo el ?SOCIALISMO? ... ... ?Es malo acaso buscar el bien comn?, ?Es malo querer VIVIR CON DIGNIDAD? ?Es esto MALO? Ni Estados Unidos (Pas nmero 10 en desarrollo humano) tiene un plan de educacin tan bueno como el cubano... ?Cmo es esto posible?  Fcil... no les interesa el DESARROLLO HUMANO... LES INTERESA QUE LA GENTE SEA INDIVIDUAL... Y ASI MANTENER EL CAPITALISMO. (El capitalismo ha convertido el PODER SOCIAL EN PODER PRIVADO DE UNOS POCOS (el trabajo de muchos se convierte en el CAPITAL de unos pocos privilegiados.)    Cuesta digerirlo por la mentalidad capitalista que nos gobierna. Todos queremos ser ricos, tener celulares, comprarnos ropa cara, relojes de marca, MC DONALDS en cada esquina, etc, etc. Pero no es esa la mentalidad cubana.    Se ha hecho un estudio (lo vi en el TVE hace 2 das) el cual dice EL CAPITALISMO HA GENERADO TANTO DINERO QUE SE PODRA MANTENER 2 VECES A LA POBLACION MUNDIAL (alrededor de 6.000 millones de personas.) ?A donde est ese dinero? ... los ricos no comparten. En este mundo hay cada da RICOS MS RICOS y POBRES MS POBRES.El capitalismo es perverso.|`|d889a366b6aab16aece0adc4bb405cc9aa	BUENA PREGUNTA PEPITO. DOS COSAS.

LA SEGUNDA ES QUE LA GENTE SE VA DE CUBA POR LA MISMA RAZN QUE HUY NATASCHA KAMPUSCH DE SU SECUESTRADOR EN AUSTRIA, ELLA SABA LEER, TENA CASA, COMA, PERO HABRA DADO SU VIDA POR SER LIBRE.

No hay miseria extrema, pero si mucha pobreza, y un problema de prostitucin grave. Adems el sistema les da semanalmente ciertos alimentos contados como ciertos gramos de frijol, de arroz, de algo que llaman masa crnica (no se porque siendo isla no pescan), ajos (no cebollas ni tomates porque para ellos son muy costosos), y un pan diario en la tienda para el desayuno. Eso es lo que recuerdo. No pasan hambre terrible pero comer todos los dias exactamente lo mismo no debe ser agradable. Hay un ambiente tristn en la isla porque si te educan y sabes lo que te estas perdiendo, es peor. La salud es gratis pero no tienen todas las medicinas. Con lo que te cuento puedes ver las razones de la gente para irse.

ae804713cebced6f05f2f610a2f156ffaa	It is interesting that people who support gun ownership always make it very general - "I deserve to have guns!" - but what kinds of guns? Assault rifles? Yeah right. Handguns? That's not going to help you shoot a deer, my friend.     Studies have also shown that it is more likely that having a gun in the house with harm one of the residents rather than protecting them from intruders.     The constitution also says that black people are 3/5 of a person. You can't just say "The constitution says it, so it can't be changed!" because it already has been.    Also, think about Brazil. They have an incredible problem with guns. However, recently they have become more strict with guns and gun ownership in certain areas, and in those areas violent crime has gone down. It's not true that all criminals will still have guns. It will make it harder for everyone.|`|AA11352868	heres my question: how do you really think that they are going to take guns away from criminals when you have a gun ban? the police cant get to your house in a split second, the criminals arent just gonna turn in theyre guns with us, Canada says ever since they put a gun ban in thier country crime rates went up. and the animal population would skyrocket out of control and animals would lose habitat and food and eventually die of starvation, thats what happened to the dinsours along with the earth frekin out on them. they are going to have to take the criminals guns away first before they can even think of taking mine away. and those studies are shown by innacurate information that has been twisted into an impossible knot|`|b152183a660c2dbd3a470965bcb67686aa	I believe gun ownership for sport like hunting (rifles) is OK.

ed2a26ffbcbe73ef0a7e9ff4df12f078aa	There are generally two ways that a case might find its way to the United States Supreme Court:  one is by appeal from a lower court, usually one of the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal, and the other is by writ of certiorari (pronounced sir-shore-ARR-ee) from a lower Federal Court or from a state supreme court.  Acceptance of a case by writ of certiorari is entirely discretionary on the part of the Court and is governed by the so-called "Rule of Four," pursuant to which a writ of certiorari will be granted by the Court, thereby accepting the case for decision by the Court, if the grant is approved by at least four of the nine justices, which is of course less than the majority of five that would be needed to decide the case itself on the merits.  The best chance of persuading the Court to accept a case exists in situations where the case presents a question of Federal constitutional or statutory law and there are existing conflicting decisions on that question among the Circuit Courts of Appeal.  At some point, not necessarily the first time it's asked to do so, the Court generally finds it appropriate and necessary to resolve so-called "conflicts among the circuits."  As you might imagine, an opinion adopted by a unanimous vote of 9 to 0 (as was the famous case of Brown v. Board of Education of the City of Topeka, Kansas, in 1954) is more influential and carries greater moral authority and "gravitas" than an opinion adopted as the opinion of the Court by a bare majority of 5 to 4.    The Chief Justice of the United States (interesting that the official name of the position is not Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but Chief Justice of the United States) is the Court's chief administrator and assigns the task of drafting opinions to the various justices and presides over the meetings of the justices at which competing opinions are discussed and the position of the Court coalesces around a prevailing opinion.  It is possible that one or more of the justices may not concur with the opinion of the majority, and in such cases any member of the minority may write a dissenting opinion in which other justices may join, which is then appended to the majority opinion when it is published in the Supreme Court Reports.    The Supreme Court convenes for the conduct of its business and decision of cases on the first Monday in October in each year, which is the first day of each new term of the Court.  Most of the preceding summer is spent by the justices individually, some in their summer vacation retreats and others in their offices in the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., in reviewing petitions for certiorari filed in the Court to determine in each such case whether as many as four justices will vote in favor of granting the petition so that the Court in its entirety might take up the case and, after reviewing briefs filed by the counsel on both sides, hear oral arguments of counsel on both sides in open court and then meet in conference to decide the case by majority vote.      In general, it is necessary that an opinion receive the votes of at least five of the nine justices in order to become the opinion of the Court and thus the law of the land.|`|4c05963c13f909f7a2747ca9bb90005eaa	Well if it's pizza, someone has to make the call before it can be sent.|`|c9c23a7a91ba166cb81c18e48b6c9917aa	Well someone has to give some documents to a page so it can be sent to the supreme court.

How can you conservatives concentrate on terrorist and not on stereotypes? How though have conservatives been with Osama?|`|e8aba39c7e1a7fd4aa8f70ba008e2d26aa	I'm going to start out by saying I have voted Republican for most of my adult life, until the last presidential election. (Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.)    As for the liberals being tough on Terrorists. Erhmmmm. Who was propping up Saddam Hussein in the 1980's? It isn't really a big secret, even though most people are either too young to remember or too stubborn and too proud to admit they were snookered by the political party they'd been loyal to for so long. The United States conservative (read neoconservative) "anti-Communists" propped him up, and put him in a position to become the dictator he finally became. Never any evidence that Saddam was actually an international terrorist with WMD, you understand, but if you're implying that conservatives, unlike liberals, are tough on the people you call "terrorists", this proves you are mistaken. As does the fact that the same conservative "anti-Communists" supplied weapons to the freedom fighters whom we now consider "terrorists" in Afghanistan.    To be tough on terrorists, a real conservative (NOT a neoconservative) would be tough on the elements that create terrorism. A real conservative would remove American troops from all foreign conflicts, the complexities of which most Americans don't understand, or else exploit for personal gain. The US ALWAYS makes local conflicts worse by supplying deadly weaponry, matched by the deadly weaponry contributions made by the US' rival superpowers. Civil war tends to break out when America comes a-liberating, or the country goes Communist or socialist or subjected to shar'ia law soon after "liberation."    A true conservative would also eliminate the factors that create anti-American terrorists by rebuilding trust and admiration for America worldwide through diplomacy, fair and respectful economic practices and humanitarian endeavors (not tax supported, but funded by individual citizens who weren't being taxed to death), in paying equal attention to the people being oppressed in non oil producing nations such as Sudan and Uganda and North Korea as they are to those being oppressed by dictators we used to support in oil-producing nations.    In short, please don't vote Republican tomorrow (unless a REAL conservative is running). Don't vote Democratic either (not that you would), because they have their OWN set of shady dealings that have gone unchecked for too long. Vote independent  wherever possible. Libertarian, Green, Right to Life, Constitution (if the person running isn't someone the party picked up at a garage sale at the last minute)...ANYTHING but the parties we've put up with for far too long.

f775989638f4e7d87c66551509e4a831aa	We don't. Perhaps we did back when it took days travel between the states. Now that modern technology allows votes to be counted almost instantly, its a bit of an anachronism.     Electoral votes could be portioned out and assigned right as the vote comes in, without the use of Electors. Giving each state two extra votes balances out the power disparity between small and large states. This means in some ways that people who live in a small state have a greater say in national politics, however this was done because of the Federal nature of our government. Power is divided between the State governments and National government. The use of Electoral votes balances things out somewhat.|`|AA11273424	The few who have power and privilege are terrified of the people gaining even a little power.|`|063327825fa1f5bf21e56f047c951627aa	we don't. it should be eliminated, the recent close senate elections make the point that the college is not necessary at all.|`|d3920179c0c6134de7306d62c2807d1faa	We needed  a college to rival Harvard.  j/k    Yes, it's demeaning.

Some are currently winner takes all!|`|9b16f0f4e2cb28a0b42a9fb95b5a10e9aa	so all states get a voice ..the electoral college prevents big states out ruling the smaller states.|`|AA10515896	Well, it's mandated by the Constitution, so that's the first hurdle in changing it.    The main reason is obsolete, which is that 230 years ago, it took weeks to count the ballots in each state. So, that was only useful for determining the electors in each state, who then traveled to DC to cast their vote for the candidates. It was a technological and logistic problem back then that the college addressed.    However, the goal was also two-fold. The college made the smaller states have more of a vote, because they get the round-up from their population relative to number of Representatives, plus the two votes for number of Senators. That means the larger states have a little bit less overwhelming decision-making power compared to the small or less-populated states.    The easiest solution isn't getting rid of the electoral college. It's having states change the way electoral ballots are allocated, so that it is proportional to the popular vote in each state, rather than being all-or-nothing in each state.|`|77e90ab7e3eb6e316bb67e7b86e9ac5aaa	Because hair grows and sometimes you have to cut it so that you conform to the constitution, i would suggest that when hair stops growing you will have your answer.|`|e123ba186cea4e32b1880639ba3d784daa	So the small states have a chance..|`|42638f6b2b2d1985c162049f026f7075aa	we don't and its not about small states its about controlling elections|`|3116f73986408b1a641fa2020bb9279daa	Something to do with more populated states not dominating smaller states..there was wide debate about this which many  thought it was a train crash waiting to happen....Bush  is proof of that!!|`|c5c8eef50ba44dc41e92a7e4cfb769d6aa	yeah, it began as an insult too because the "amazing" framers didn't think the country would ever become politically literate.  apparently congress agrees.

Respecto a Mexico, nosotros, no tenemos opinin ni buena ni mala, la verdad, nos da igual, y conocemos poco... as que me imagino que si en el problema se col la nacionalidad, vino ms de parte de los mexicanos (que tengo entendido, que no les caemos del todo bien)    (Ojo: aclaro, que de los mexicanos que conoc, todos fueron muy buena onda conmigo.

776640e19638fb4f3eb033407e035c37aa	This is his second attempt to do so. The first one, with the war in the early stages and his being a Democrat in a Republican controlled congress, went nowhere.  I feel there are two ways of looking at it. First, you could take him at face value when he says that the poor and uneducated are the ones doing all the fighting and that it is a form of discrimination to make those kids do most of the fighting. (This was an argument also used during Vietnam.)  The second possibility is that he is trying to force attention on the fact that the war isnt going so well, and by asking for a draft he can create a critical mass of anti-war sentiment and perhaps bring down the Republicans. Which way you believe probably depends on your politics.|`|AA11370204	He was proposing a bill in the House to start the draft.|`|AA11048920	All that was in the news about it was that Rangel wants to see the draft instituted again. In my opinion, he has a good point. The poor and indigent are the ones paying the price for this war and the price in in the form of their lives. As soon as the middle class and upper class have to pay for it with the lives of their sons and daughters, their will be far more judicious decision making applied to military actions.|`|62722318232c81986840d7aa35854bc4aa	Yes. This isn't new, he has sponsored such bills before. The difference now is that his party has a majority & he will chair a very powerfull committee (Ways & Means).|`|d3920179c0c6134de7306d62c2807d1faa	Rep. Rangel is the representative from Harlem.  Many of his constituents are avidly against this war, and they are the ones losing their lives to the cause.  It's the same in any poorer urban district.  He believes that with a draft we will be less likely to go to war with a reasonable cause.    He saw the war on the Taliban in Afghanistan as just, and the war in Iraq as injust.  He did not waver in that belief, and he is a veteran of the Korean war.|`|dbed0f4bfea4d70a8459015b785ceff2aa	Why The Draft?  We have leaders in Congress that have no idea  what the military is about!  Never carried a rifle, never slept in a barracks, never dug a fox hole, never separated from family, never been shot at, never experienced errors on the battlefield and that cost, never seen officers miss use troops and that cost,     Bottom line, THEY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE!  Someone needs to be in the decision making process that have actual Hands-On-Experience.  Committees made up of no experience is not the answerer, Listing to generals with no experience to judge their issues is not the answerer.    The majority of the Masses, with position and means, do not feel that they should serve in the military of this country.  How many in either the Congress or Senate has been on active duty?    People off the Block, in  the slums, that have to fight at school, fight on the way home, and fight just to play basket ball on the corner, know more about war and how to stay alive than the ones making war decisions that effect the survivability of Americas Soldiers.    Mr. Rumsfield wanted to do away with the tank; he was never shot at on the battle field.      Our troops are being killed because the ones that never carried a weapon think there is a sweet, kind, FAIR, honorable way to fight a war!  The only kind way is to not go to war!  After that, you kill everybody in front of you, dog, cat mama, son, brother, sister and you burry hand grenades in their grandfathers grave!    The Baldest Military in the History of mankind, and no one fears going to war with us!  No one fears killing one of our soldiers!  WHY.  Because the ones that never served their country are sitting in their comfortable chair, before the TV, saying, that aint fair.   Oh we mistreated our prisoners, while the other side cuts off heads, rape, execute and all else.  We are not like them? Wrong answerer!  We should be worse than any enemy,   The world should share one idea about going to war against America, and that is, Do what ever, say what ever, but dont cause us to have to go to war against America  The last thing any country should want is to know that our troops are coming with weapons.  Dont get mad folks, its just business, or should I say WAR!|`|90a8774ea08ea42c254b9e204658b644aa	He is CONSIDERING it, but very few other democrats or republicans believe the draft is the way to go.|`|72df629ccf0db795715707f386266f20aa	Yes he does.

Make love, not war...    |`|1f0475725730d54b6d3f89e154205f08aa	He's introducing legislation - but this doesn't mean he WANTS the draft.  Sometimes, politicians introduce legislation in order to force the Congress's hand to make a statement about something.  In this case - Rangel wants to see just HOW pro-war the hawks really are.  It's easy to support a war if you know you won't have to make a personal sacrifice (i.e. seeing one of your own children go off to war)....but when all 18-25 year olds are "fair game" to be sent - it gets the citizenry a lot more involved in really THINKING about the war.      The Republicans pulled a similar stunt last November after John Murtha made comments that Republicans (incorrectly) interpreted to mean that he wanted to immediately withdraw all troops from Iraq (this ISN'T what he said - but it's how the Republicans WANTED to interpret what he said).    Following Murtha's comments, Republicans led by Duncan Hunter of California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, responded by proposing a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of all troops from Iraq.    The resolution was intended to demonstrate that those calling for immediate troop withdrawl were out of the mainstream.      Of course, the resolution went down in flames - 403-3...no Republicans - not even the ones who introduced the legislation, voted for it.    It was a political statement - not a serious attempt to pass real legislation.    Rangel's upcoming proposal is a similar political statement.  I'm sure Rangel himself will not vote for his own legislation.|`|AA12098362	It is a conservative blog site, but this is him talking about bringing back the draft.  A few dems ran on a platform of the draft during the midterms.  I think he is serious and he is doing it to pull a win out of Iraq.  Remember, our enemies are trying a war of atrition and believe they just have to wait us out, with the draft we can go a lot longer in that region.|`|AA11731779	He has been pushing it. His reason is that if more whites were killed we'd stop the war. What a joke one only has to see who are the most being kill they aren't blacks and minorities. He is just a racist!

The liberal leftist extremists regularly preach against things like bigotry, but practice them every day.  Anyone who speaks out the truth against them, they label as a bigot, and the communist media supports their claim.    Two of the biggest super-bigots in the country, sharpton and jackson, make their living by spreading hate, division, and bigotry.  Just yesterday I heard sharpton on the radio calling the 'black' officers in new york 'racist' against blacks.  This is the logic of liberalism.    These hatemongers are partly responsible for the government facilitating division and bigotry through affirmative craption.  People are labeled as to their gender, color, and religion.  They are treated differently and afforded opportunities based on the same criteria.  This is the purest form of bigotry.  Through this legislation people are awarded positions, etc. with no regard to their merits or qualifications.    Charles Barron is a criminal for inciting violence and hatred, but he is allowed to do so simlpy because he has darker skin than some people, and this is facilitated by the leftist extremist media who hates police, the USA, and the Constitution.  The Constitution is one of the biggest enemies of liberalism, so fascist judges simply sodomize it.    The day people are all treated equally and the media prints the truth will be the day that liberalism is doomed.  These hatemongering bigots will never allow that to happen.    Liberalism is, in itself, a mental disorder.

Jesus is even in the Koran as a great prophet.  I also realize that someone with a radical mindset could use the Bible for violence just as they do with the Koran.  If one reads the Bible, old and new testament, they will see that we are in a new convent with the arrival of Jesus.  Jesus is unmistakably God on earth, who died for us.

AA11807296	En mi opinin? pienso que la ejecucin fue brbara.... ese tipo de prcticas son verdaderamente arcicas... creo que la pena de muerte no`debera existir... y no por los derechos humanos y la sarta de tarugadas con las que salen algunos grupos provida... sino por que:    1. En caso de que el sentenciado o en nombre del mismo se pudiera probar la inocencia post-mortem no habra nada que hacer.  2. Se presta a revanchas y conveniencias polticas.  3. El castigo se acaba... si realmente es unc astigo por grandes crmenes como asesinatos, tortura, etc... deberan encerrarlos de por vida a trabajos forzados.. poca comida, y las peores condiciones de vida, para que realmente lo sufran y no acaben con su problema quitndoles la existencia.|`|017924e619b44c6159ff802595ee7d90aa	No a la pena de muerte! el mundo seguira igual y no cambiara nada....

39f995aaead6b9b6cf4abd92cdfbb2afaa	It doesn't matter that he didn't hit you.  Holding you to keep you from moving is called "unlawful confinement" and dragging you across a lawn is an assault.  If he is a boyfriend or husband it IS domestic violence.  Call the police to report it.|`|2c8ea14823d0b1fd95de9cb68466d222aa	Sounds like kidnapping at a minimum.

This is a regular case, most of the time a misdemeanor unless blood is drawn or serious injury is sustained; then it is felonious.    Hostage falls more under entrapment as you are holding person(s) in a domicile that they can't escape from against their will.  This is a federal charge and can get you life behind bars.|`|b68dd006a4a1ed62729e6c29fcde1845aa	In most states, YES|`|AA10016294	That is actually a little worse than domestic violence.

Trust your instincts - if you FEEL you were being assaulted - then you probably were.  And nobody - NOBODY has a right to hold you somewhere you don't want to be.|`|dfbfdcf9b2aafeca1078702e876fd283aa	You were held "against you will"  which means you did not agree to stay with him.  Depending where you live this could be a form of kidnapping.|`|2b87997e3f85173b8cc70d6964f33da9aa	YES!!!!  Unlawful imprisonment or kidnapping, depending on the state and how the district or county attorney (or whoever, depending on where you live) want to process it.  A similar thing happened to me -it was awful, but I was also assaulted. The charge then was unlawful imprisonment among others. Please, please get away from this person, especially if you have children.  There are people out there to help- you will be surprised how many people care about you, even perfect strangers reached out to me after what happened.

3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	It is possible, but not right now.    The USAF is not taking prior service recruits at this time, except combat controllers and para-rescue prior service.    About 6 months before your husband ETS's, he should contact a USAF recruiter to see if the USAF is taking prior service recruits. Things do change over time.    The reason it is hard for prior service to switch service, is that prior service take a reenlistment slot, not an enlistment slot. So it is all based on the reenlistment rate in the field they want to go to.    Another point to remember, you will probably lose any reenlistment bonus he might have received in the Marines and will more than likely take a rank cut.    Non USAF prior service entering the USAF go to a 10 day course at Lackland AFB to learn service customs, uniform wear and rank structure.    Good Luck !!!!!!|`|20ca577a27043d494c911596979845ceaa	Why would anyone in their right mind want to join the Air Force when they're already in the USMC, the most elite branch of the military there is. To answer your question: He can join any branch of the military he wants after his duty in The Marines. Also since he's already had Marine Corp. bootcamp training he doesn't have to do The Air Force bootcamp. However, if you were a flyboy, squid or soldier wanting to join The Marines you would have to complete USMC bootcamp. Tell him to remain a devildog. oohrah!|`|AA10878563	first off, of course its possible. But you need to remember, the air force is very different and you may be required to move somewhere that marines typically dont worry about going. Other than that, the airforce is a great branch. They take care of famiies so well. Oh, the other problem you might have is if they need his particular skill. They might reclassify him and he could be a bus driver or something dumb, so look out for that and good luck|`|AA11137897	I highly doubt it. From my last conversation about this at work, AF arent taking people from other branches if they are enlisted. If they are officers, it might be different, but I doubt it.     You can definately ask a recruiter so they can clarify it more for you.|`|AA10400679	sometime there is a problem with the switch because he is a marine ... US Marines are the harcore soldiers of this country. because he is a mechanic and his job is definately a need then he shouldnt have a problem.... Ever hear that " Once a Marine always a Marine" ?  That kind of somes up the problem right there ... because for the most part its true|`|207Mbe7Zaa	Yes, it's possible. The difference now from the old congressional wars, Vietnam etc. is that he could not transfer until completion of his obligation he agreed to even by re-upping. Tell him just don't re-up again and take his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps and then join the Airline Union as a mechanic for a few months only and then the absolute best way to join the Air Force would be to go to New Orleans or anywhere east as far as just past Biloxi along the beach. For two reasons. The Air Force is a DOD 1947 force, the Marine Corps first met in a tavern in 1775. In that Katrina was the worst natural disaster ever, i.e. since 1776 also the ICC "International Commercial Building Codes" are back 500 years, i.e. 1507 A.D. this year. Thus he would have fair winds beneath his wings. He might want to add that to his resume. Private pilots are the best in his profession. Then after4 in the Air Force he should join the APA, Airline Pilots Association only if he accrues at least 6 hours of his forty for any solo. Climb every mountain Marine! And reach for the skies. Take a moment maybe once a week for one only 1765 Hennesey of France at any NCO club. Only 1. And if you haven't seen Clint Eastwood's movie. . .uh. . .4 stars because he forgot the Marine pilot who flew over when they had to take a second photo as he banked left and returned again at a lower altitude to the right and banked right and landed. i.e. Marine Air is infantry. Air Force has to decide. On your retirement DD-214 his Marine service will show first then Air Force as a total years months days. Good luck Marine, good luck to you also Marine Corps Wife. Be sure to bring the Air Force a nice set of service. Be safe, be wise, be good at it too.|`|qvIZE9chaa	I attempted to switch from the navy as an electronics tech to the air force. Get onto air force.com and find a recruiter near you and talk to them. What I was told was that the Air Force generally doesn't take prior service personnel. If they do accept you you're likely to lose at least one rank in transit. They probably won't be able to give you a definitive answer until closer to the end of your current enlistment.|`|d58771092808bc9c6bedebf88231f87faa	I looked to transfer from being a Bee in the Navy to the AF for a while. There's a link on there site somewhere that I ran into for recruiting from other branches. Anything is possible, but from personal experience they usualy don't want someone from other branches for some reason. Maybe cause they're so pampered overall compared to the other branches? Honestly I think that the AF thinks once you've been in one branch you are 'stuck in that rut' of thinking.
31b5d9b921967244b6af97536d5a5463aa	You gotta call the jail. You probably have to pay through the office at the jail then they will give the inmate some kinda credit at the store. Each Jail has thier own protocol for stuff like that.|`|AA10726551	Go to the site I attached and scroll down to Trust Fund. It explains the procedures for putting money in an IM's trust fund. You cannot send money in the form of cash directly to the IM. It has to go to the trust fund.   Former TDCJ C/O.|`|eOBWOCdVaa	you`re better off sending a postal order dont know what you call this in the states anyone could steal cash|`|5kTTAJc8aa	Yes, you have to send money in the form of a money order - preferably from the US Post Office.  You also have to have "money slips" from the inmate. The inmate has to send these money slips to you or you can request them from TDJC. You fill the slip out, including inmate's number,  your name and address and then it is mailed to Huntsville (all money goes through Huntsville first).  They keep track of who sends money and how much, always looking for "pay-offs" or bribe money.  The inmate is notified when the money comes and is on his book.  The "book" is a running talley of the inmates money - coming and going.    County or City "Jail" and TX Dept of Corrections is two totally different places.
AA11464583	The "Louisiana Employment Security Law" provides for unemployment compensation. All employers who paid $1,500 in wages during any quarter in the current or preceding year or employed at least one person, full time or part time, during twenty calendar weeks are covered. Covered employers must make contributions to the Louisiana Unemployment Trust Fund, from which eligible persons' benefits are drawn.    To qualify for unemployment benefits, a claimant must not be unemployed due to his or her "misconduct." Misconduct is based on the specific facts of each case, but has been found to include:  1. Refusing to follow a supervisor's direct orders;  2. Repeated tardiness;  3. Directing profane language at a supervisor;  4. Repeated absenteeism without notice or without good reason;  5. Leaving one's area of responsibility without first obtaining permission;  6. Deliverately violating an employer's reasonable rules of employment;  7. Refusing to submit to a drug test in accordance with company policy;  8. Working while under the influence of drugs or alcohol;  9. sleeping on the job; and  10. Theft of company property.    Additionally, a claimant must be able to work, available to work, conducting an active search for work, and unemployed for a waiting period of one week. In addition to misconduct, other reasons for disqualification from receiving unemployment compensation benefits include, but are not limited to:  1. Leaving a job without "good cause";  2. Failing to apply for or accept suitable work;  3. Failing to report to work because of involvement in a labor dispute;  4. Receiving or seeking unemployment benefits in another state;  5. Receiving vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay, bonuses, wages in lieu of notice, payments under Workers' Compensation, or payment under a retirement or pension plan;  6. Fraudulently seeking or receiving benefits to which the employee is not entitled;  7. Being discharged for using illegal drugs. To use drug test results as evidence, employers must maintain a written drug testing policy, and the guidelines outlined in the section of this information dealing with drug testing must be followed.    While an employuer is not charged directly for the unemployment compensation benefits paid to its employees, the employer must contribute to the Unemployment Trust Fund at a predetermined rate based on experience. In other words, an employer with a high number of employees who are awarded unemployment benefits will finds its "experience rating" and consequently its contribution to the trust fund, increased the following year.    It is therefore in your best interest to ensure that employees who were terminated for misconduct are denied unemployment compensation benefits. This includes contesting an initial determination of benefits and appearing before an appeals referee to present the facts concerning the termination of employment.    Whoever knowingly makes a false statement to the unemployment agency in order to obtain or increase payments, or to avoid to reduce any contributions will be fined up to $1,000 or imprisoned up to ninety days, or both. Further, officers and directors having the responsibility of remitting contributions can be held personally liable for the total amount of the contributions not collected together with any interest, penalties, and fees accruing theron.|`|d5dc767bbbf7b5754fb006e2d8b4e871aa	The law is...there is no employment security in LA  *hahaha*

This would include such elements as:    1)  Personal responsibility  2)  Consequence of actions  3)  Teaching kids there ARE winners and losers  4)  Enforcing the nations laws  5)  Learning how to once again think critically  6)  Striving towards excellence and not mediocrity  7)  Making sure kids can read BEFORE they advance in school - not promoting them to the next grade because it would be detrimental to their self-esteem to hold them back    The list goes on.    We don't need a new order.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	That's a dangerous person|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Not if you have been paying attention.|`|el8yX5q3aa	similar words by Hitler.... .....and also by the white supremacy groups.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Well good luck with your Socialistic majority !!

Just plain stupid, and seemingly racist.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	People are greedy and Obama is doing the right thing.

lRmhwiYpaa	I believe you are right.    If you even had to go against a Policeman's word you would know even with proof you are not taken serious by anyone    My female lawyer said she knows of cases where men have been beaten by the police and then arrested and taken to the police station  but even a lawyer could not do anything as there was no proof and it was not worth suing the police~~as they always win    The police are not always the good guys~I know this from experience|`|roAahzkIaa	No|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	It's been that way for a while.    Try starting a business.    Everybody wants a piece of the action.    The Mafia was easier to deal with.|`|GHusBLjgaa	No the Constitution is one part of the law so is precedents, and other statutes. Police develop their traditions to work within the Constitution, and other statutory regulations placed on them. For a great example of this look at the 4th Amendment which talks about unreasonable searches and seizures.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	And of course, tradition is anything they say it is.  You will have to wait for someone to win a court case against them for violating the Constitution.  Only then will things change.    Until then, keep your head down and walk carefully or you might just get "traditioned" senseless.

TfpeYyuwaa	There is a difference, but they have been so brainwashed by talk radio and Fox into thinking they are one and the same that they really can't tell the difference. Their lower education level explains why thy don't do their own research, and allow Rush and Hannity to do it for them.|`|DBIKou8faa	When the government and industry get in bed together it's become Socialized.    It is what it is,|`|Souvww0maa	The left has been bluring that line.    Liberalism has been slowly becoming socialism, because the term "socialism" wasn't acceptable in the mainstream.  It is too reminiscent of the Soviet era.    The left is very good at "re-labeling" things to make them more acceptable to the public.  They aren't socialists, they are "liberals".  They aren't far-left, they are "centrists".  They aren't pro-abortion, they are "pro-choice".  The list goes on.    As they say - if you control the language, you control the culture.  And THAT is precisely what the left is trying to do.|`|BquqToGaaa	Yes. many are still stuck on stupid.  Socialism was a rally cry for the conservatives during the election.  it is their only way of possibly winning back seats in the house and senate during the next elections.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Interesting question. And yes, I do. But it would appear that you don't. You certainly do not demonstrate that knowledge in your question. Nor do you recognize the fact that a person can be both.     Then too there is the fact that there are many different forms of socialism. Look up the words 'democratic socialism'. Regardless, intelligent people know what he is and what they're doing.     But good try. Hope that helps.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	They call it Liberalism but it is really Socialism.    That is what people need to know and understand.    Putting the government in control of something (education, health care, banks) is not Liberalism, it's Socialism.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	Liberalism is the PC way to institute their ultimate desire, socialism.    Read Atlas Shrugged.  It is coming. (And conservatives are the ones who say "see ya.")|`|2852cfe4afec920a2a2c717b5cbf04c5aa	No, what he's doing is socialist. He wants to steal from people who earn money and give it to those who choose not to provide anything valuable to society. That is Socialism.    "From each according to his means, to each according to his needs." This is exactly what BO is trying to do. If you want more, work harder. That's what most of us do.    .|`|9npIzlHKaa	They do not know the difference and they will not take the time to find out about either.|`|c3vPZfghaa	They are deliberately mischaracterizing them both in order to misinform the people who are naive , uneducated, very suggestible, and do not know the difference.    Coincidentally, advertisers know who they are, which shows why talk-radio ends up with so much advertising dollars.    I can almsot understand Thomas Green-type liberals being called socialists, but even then they don't support government control of the economy, so it is still a mischaractarization.    It is perpetuated by anarcho-capitalists that feel they should have all power to exploit the working class, and dominate the government with their wealth, depriving the workign class of the power of their vote.|`|hdUmMuN9aa	You mean the broad class of political philosophies that considers individual liberty and equality as there main goals??    Because what I see is a massive shift of power from the private sector to the government under the guise that the "free market" (if we can even call it that) can't take care of itself and is in dire need of government intervention by people who refuse to follow the laws they write for the little people....    "Let them eat cake.." Amirite?|`|wQ5LKysaaa	Did you seriously type that question, and then comment that conservatives seem undereducated?    Puuuu-leeeeze.  I don't even need to be specific here.  Haven't you ever heard the Democrats' favorite catchphrase?     "Redistribution of wealth"    Folks, this blatant show of ignorance is the perfect example as to why the Socialist Party won the election.  Unbelievable.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Socialism - any of various social systems based on shared or government ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.    The Federal Government has already slipped into socialism. Read this definition and tell me how, now that the government owns and administrates private banks i.e. Bank of America, this does not fit that definition.
5d9pCmjyaa	Don't you think that if Advertising did not work, companies would have abandoned it long ago?    Advertising works.    And that should be proof enough for you to conclude that people's opinions really are controlled by what they see and hear.    I've said it enough times, but still people don't believe.   What you see and hear is being controlled.  And through that means, you are being controlled.  It's been scientifically proven numerous times: the individual can make conscious decisions but the masses cannot.  Today, free speech is being used on us all to corrupt the democratic process - to harness it for the benefit of those who can afford to manipulate the masses.|`|IUXriZQJaa	"it wasn't their money.."    EXACTLY!!    Superbowl had a bottom-out year. More advertisers cancelled than at any time in history.    The excessive consumption of this culture is catching up to us, and we will soon have to pare back all the waste to take care of the needs.      --------    "Because many banks were forced to take the money. Many did not need nor want the bailout, bu the government FORCED them to take it. Why should that make them change their business?"    Interesting. Care to elaborate?    --------      "Didn't hear you whining when bush gave BILLIONS to wall street.    Why the flip flop?"    That's because (as usual) you weren't paying attention to anything but your game comsole and your daily dose of MSM propaganda.  There was no flip flop.    --------    The banks give away that money because they want to perpetuate their little empires and have someone to turn to when this all gets ugly.|`|v0G9s9ktaa	Didn't hear you whining when bush gave BILLIONS to wall street.    Why the flip flop?|`|c2hfVjxgaa	"Often Imitated"  we did complain when Bush wanted to bail out.  Don't  you follow the news?|`|AA10206116	They had already budgeted in the Super Bowl long before the bailouts. Same goes for the jet Citibank bought. It was already paid for.    I'm not saying it's right, but that it wasn't like they just got money from the government and just blew it right away.|`|AA12221077	They're not "giving" money to anyone.  Advertising creates revenue, which is why you advertise in the fist place:  to MAKE money.|`|2CO7pPdoaa	it wasn't their money..|`|2852cfe4afec920a2a2c717b5cbf04c5aa	Because many banks were forced to take the money.

eUdBD4tPaa	Absolutely!  It's called legislating from the bench.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Yes, they are.    Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has said that the courts should be activist.  In many cases, the Constitution does not address relevant issues, so its difficult for the justices to interpret the Constitution on such issues.  The court must then decide what the law should be.    Congress is always eager to pass the buck to the courts rather than legislate.  That enables our elected officials to avoid taking a stand on many controversial issues.  I wonder how many of our elected representatives would faint if the Supreme Court refused to hear a case and said, This is a case that should be handled by legislators, not judges.|`|PDJ8cy68aa	I'm pretty sure courts were meant to be political. How can they get "too political"? We need courts to keep our government in check. Also, the courts don't create policies, they judge them.|`|9npIzlHKaa	Yes - in the last 8 years an attempt has been made to pack the courts with those that have right wing affiliations.  Many attorneys were fired because of their left wing affiliations.  This is wrong in so many ways and is an attempt to usurp the law in favor of a political philosophy.
Souvww0maa	Anyone with even a sliver of ability to exercise critical thought should want this bill to fail.  This bill is not good for America.

roAahzkIaa	All praises to the great and only Rush|`|kTaa8ejpaa	You goofy people, like Barack Hussein Obama, are really afraid of Rush Limbaugh, huh?    I have never listened to him before but I have seen him quite a few times recently on fox and other news shows discussing how and why Obama, the insecure one, is singling him out.    Let's single out Michael Moore instead and perhaps that greek pig, George Soros.|`|AA11593583	No. But Obama is giving Rush great press.     When will Democrats (aka Liberals) realize as long as they keep throwing money at the problems of the current economy, the problems won't go away?    Financial companies stocks started taking a beating because they had been making bad decisions for decades. It started coming back to bite them and everyone paniced. Someone came up with the oxymoron 'toxic securities'. What the heck does that mean? Toxic means it will kill you. Security means safe. So how can something that will kill you be safe? Or does it mean it will safely kill you?     Bush asked Congress to authorize $700 billion dollars for TARP. And the market and economy tanked more. Congress authorized it and the market and economy tanked some more.    Half the TARP funds went out the door and the market and economy are still tanking.    Obama asked Congress for a 'new' stimulus package and the market and economy aren't any better.     Pelosi and company wrote  'stimulus package' that has so much pork in it you can hear the squeals and the market and economy is still sinking.    And now the Senate looks like it will jump the price tag to $900 billion. HMMMM I wonder what the market wil do now? Let me check. It's down another 60 points.    President Obama. If you want to really help the economy, tell Congress to shut up and sit down. Everything they touch turns to poop!     Congress and their actions on some things, inactions on other is a major cause of the problems this country is facing. Congress authorizes the spending and makes the rules. But the spending they are authorizing isn't helping and the rules make no sense.     Who amoung you actually thinks the people who cause the problems because of complicity, stupidity, arrogance, ignornace, and incompetance is going to be the solution to the problem?    It's not Rush that is the problem. It's Congress! And OBTW I don't listen to Rush.|`|YkseyT7zaa	To think, this is their leader - sad.  a 300 pound out of control DJ|`|vpEDVEiKaa	LOL He is the religous right!

Laughable really.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	No - the Dems have.    Barry is bonkers.    He needs to wake up - he is not running anymore and does not need to engage in media banter.

Edit:  As you can see from some of the insulting answers, some Republicans like to describe us as not being able to make our own decisions or to describe us as being dependent due to some alleged inherent character flaws. These same people somehow think that Republicans will be able to appeal to African American voters. They had better think again.|`|Souvww0maa	Steele is the wrong kind of black political leader.

Current problems are all Clinton's fault, or Carter's if you want to go even further back, including 9-11, the economy, the wars, education, the environment, etc. etc.    I think history goes a little something like this:  W:  Perfect in every way, but gets blamed for all of the bad stuff left over from Clinton that he had to deal with.  Clinton:  The Devil incarnate.  Horrible, lying man, didn't do anything right.  All foreign affairs disasters can be placed squarely on his shoulders.  Bush Sr:  Perfect in every way.  He didn't lie about taxes, that was Carter's fault.  Reagan:  Some sort of demi-God sent to earth.  Did absolutely no wrong.  Eradicated drugs from America.    Carter:  Did everything wrong, can be blamed for anything that went wrong in Bush Sr and Reagan's presidencies.     At least, that's what Republicans want you to believe.  I can't believe I didn't see it before - Republicans are perfect!|`|IBFlHjsdaa	This is what happens when a leader does what he HAS to do, rather than what people WANT  him to do.

When I started  in supervision, my boss told be, there would ve times when I had to make a decision, and he would have ,more respect for me if I made a wrong decision, rather than to NOT make a decision.    You might have seen on this post, who many people saw Jimmie Carter as a weak leader? He was. When he had to make a decision, he froze.

8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	Yes, it is very sad and disgraceful to the dead. Tillman's memory was tainted by lies (again). Even Bush was warned by an aide to not say anything he would regret the day after Tillman was reported killed. What gain would it have been to use Tillman as something he wasn't? His family is very much opposed to Bush and this war, and I am hopeful that they will pursue this matter all the way up to the White House--and give a dishonorable discharge and prison time to the Battalion Commander responsible for holding back the truth on official documents and to the Tillman family. Disgraceful!|`|7d876f5df4a4f73550ae42634f24d4ecaa	u mean Tillman and the other 33 ---sure -- there is nothing morally can stop this neocons|`|cf647d3cf260dfad332272f9d52f0ba1aa	On these "televised funerals, who is physically there and what lie is told and at what part of the ceremony is it said?

AA10167220	Jimmy Carter is a lame pacifist who would only end up apologizing for the "transgressions of the US and the UK against Iran" to get the hostages freed. He needs to be left back in the 1970s where most Americans thought we left him.    And, considering that Jimmy Carter did such a WONDERFUL job with the first set of hostages Iran took, people who think it would be a wonderful idea need to read some history books. Obviously, they weren't alive during THAT crisis.    Have a GREAT Army day!! Huah!!    P.S.

Direct Democracy effects everyone but in the US a president/governor/local judge etc. may only reflect the views of the majority of people who actually vote i.e. 50% + 1.    Press releases of this kind tend to be very eloquent and center around the principles of civil liberties, checked and balanced government and natural rights (meaning the rights that people are born with regardless of the law)|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Well, first of all we would need to have a direct democracy in the United States in order for it to work.

See that is interesting because its a very simple answer to a complex problem, some might say too simple.  Maybe there were people that already thought of this as a possible outcome to an armed conflict and saw fit to expedite these conflicts in a timely and more controlled manner.|`|kM4bxcP2aa	That wouldn't work. It's unfair to suggest that Iran would nuke us anyways, seeing as they also have to worry about their own survival, and provoking america into a nuclear war would be devestating. Nuclear weapons are an impractical way of waging war, as their more like negotiating tools. If Iran got nukes it would find far more profit in brandishing them to make demands such as the release of Iranian prisoners, financial compensation for war debts, and the removal of economic blocakdes, then to actually use them. There was a similair situation in North Korea, where the North Koreans Used the nukes they allegedly had to influence the U.N. into lifting a trade embargo. Both sides lose in a nuclear war, because the cost of human lives is to great. An american nuclear attack would not be condoned by the free world, because contrary to what the American public would like to think, they are despised and resented in most countries. The attack would most likely cause the U.N. to assert its position in the world and protest against America's political bullying.     -Iran would glow in the dark    -America would become subject to intense reprisal from other nations, perhaps in the form of terrorism.    No one's happy.      I would also ask how much longer america will think it's invincible. It's destroying and torturing the nations it swore to protect, it feels its entitled to rip off whom ever it wants to sustain its massive population. It's unfair that so many countries are below the poverty line while the defenders of freedom are off goose-stepping through where ever they please so that their enormously fat and rich people can eat more cheeseburgers and drive larger SUV's. Iran dosen't hate the world, it hates America. 911 demonstrated that the U.S. bruises like a peach. America v.s. the World  would be fine for the states if it took place on forgein soil, and we all met in a field, shook hands, and then took turns shooting eachother. A few thousand americans are killed, and its plain evil. A few hundred thousand Afghans and Iraqis are killed in reprisal and its "all in a days work" for captain america. I just think America should prepare for a time when they can't win wars just by scaring their opponents into submission before a shot is fired, when it's perfect and special citizens will be put through what the Iraqi's are going through right now. They won't be able to ignore the blood on their hands forever.    hhhhh...........|`|32edf6bbc923ed62b18ed8d31e83a082aa	Only if you think like they do.|`|QdrFiviGaa	Hi, I'm from Italy. u think a nuclear war would make us better?

I don't know if we are going to get a chance to blow Iran away. The British just may do it for us. They are a gritty bunch, like ourelves, and this incident , in my view is an act of war. Iran is where a lot of the bomb making material is coming from too, along with being part of the insurgency. The sooner Iran is neutralized, the better the world will be, because the rest of the region will settle right down, not wanting to suffer the same fate.|`|PqiSHkJOaa	Yes nuke Iraq also, then Exxon Mobile can charge us $1500.00 per gallon...|`|739b5e09f8ab7f9b2896465ffdfbcf9baa	With the way our country has been I wouldn't be surprised if we did|`|c88f6f6809106495094cfec97af2d08baa	Sarcastic question or not.  Ans:  It will most likely come to that, however I don't think the powers that be in Washington have the grit to do so.  It would not be politically correct.    I also believe that Israel will ultimately do the job, that is if they want to survive.  Many nations have aided Iran in the development of Nuclear power,  France, Germany, Russia, etc.  From the intel I have seen, I believe there is evidence Iran already has three nukes.  Just don't have the means of delivering them on target.    If you look at the majority of the ans. to your question, you will see that the majority would not support this action no matter what.  That is until it is too late.    It does not take a large nuke to do terrible damage.  It can be placed in a brief case which can easily be smuggled into this nation.  Four or five in strategic locations will paralyze this nation.  And guess what, we will not be able to define the country they came from.    Israel knows how vulnerable they are  We on the other hand are invincible.  Smile.  Or is that a full belly laugh.  Most people think so.  How sad and wrong.

Unless we're writing in Arabic, we're just approximating the pronounciation of the country's name, and Iraq is actually a better phoenitic rendition than Irak.    The people who pick on your spelling or insult your language ability do so because they lack ideas and their arguments are frequently falacious.  -----------------  I've read your other question, and I'd like to say that two of the three people who corrected your spelling have themselves made mistakes, and American English is likely their first and only language.    Example 1: "Were is Irak?????" Sure, we're not writing for publication and it's easy to make a typo or two, but to leave out a letter in a three word answer is sign of true sloppiness, if not ignorance.

The difference between the United States - and a very few others, as well - is that we PROSECUTE our war criminals. We send them to prison for very long periods of time. And, in case you didn't know, they don't go to federal prison. They go to Ft. Leavenworth.    It is not fair to post ONE video from youtube.com and say, "Americans are killing civilians for fun."

Many Palestinians, including those who run Hamas, do not want peace with Israel.  They want Israel to be destroyed because it occupies their land.    A two state solution seems a far-fetched idea.  Israel would no doubt demand that if a state called Palestine is created, it should be disarmed.  The Palestinian leadership wont go for that.    I dont see a workable solution to this conflict.  I hope I am wrong.      Neither side is ever going to give up its religious beliefs.|`|MPpO4xQMaa	I believe there won't be any peace at least not in the few coming years, the problem isn't about Israel and Palestine actually there are a lot of international players in this Surviving game and those players keep changing constantly , it used to be Russia when Russia was a great power and all the Arabian countries were weak but after that we after that she left her chair for Iran, Syria and of course some other powers like Egypt and Saudi Arabia , while on the other side there was the UK who used to be Israel best friend and now we see the Us as the biggest ally of Israel, the peace depends on all of those countries intentions and benefits , it depends on the relationships between them and on their effect on the Palestinians and Israelis , sure the main two sides are Israel and the Palestinians but their like two gladiators being watched and supported by the international powers   we would be fools if we think the problem is about few people blow themselves and few extreme jews think Palestine is the land god promised them with, it's more complicated and that's what makes it the hardest political issue in the world|`|XSwS7Hoaaa	When the Palestinian National Authority reaches maturity (i.e. when there is a unified Palestinian government) they'll be much stronger on the diplomatic side and will be able to negotiate and actually forge their homeland.  Today they are perceived as weak, in my opinion, because there is no Palestinian voice, but a multitude of voices, from the most extreme to the moderate.  When they unite, they get what they want, a Palestinian state, and that will be the end of the conflict.
