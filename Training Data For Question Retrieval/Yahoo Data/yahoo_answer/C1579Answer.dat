PVzQvdWYaa	Hola coolgrensky, un saludito.!:    Pues mira, de Madrid a Amsterdam hay una distancia aproximada de 1468 kilometros o sea 912,18 millas.     Entre esos dos puntos seria una duracion de 16 a 20 horas.   Seria facil buscarte los horarios de alguna empresa pero tienes que tener en cuenta de donde sales en Espa?a y a donde vas en Holanda, los omnibus regionales, etc.     Ponle 24 horas para mas seguridad.     En cuanto a la segunda pregunta, indudablemente el "mejor medio" depende de cada uno.     Hay gente que no se aguanta el avion, y elige el omnibus, otros el tren, etc.    Si hubieras puesto el mas rapido, seria el avion... Pero te puedo garantizar que la ultima vez que viaje con renfe de Barcelona a Bilbao en un tren-cama, la pase hermosamente bien, y llegue fresquito como una lechuga...!!!     La verdad que disfrute ese viaje.     Espero haberte sido util.    Un abrazo.!|`|76UYqkugaa	En lo primero no te puedo ayudar,solo he hecho ese viaje en avin y son 2 horas, en cuanto a dentro de Espa?a lo mejor es en tren,son seguros y no tan caros,ya que los vuelo si son de oferta estn bien de lo contrario muy caros y los autobuses un poco pesado y menos seguros,suerte|`|79368b23ecf3ac82b9d22f3c202329b4aa	no tengo la menor idea xD    salu2|`|e3f7ae084ffbdd28c00f1458f20c2b5caa	unas 36 horas,y la segunda en avion
phFS7fkPaa	Barcelona es GRANDE, tiene entre la propia ciudad y sus alrededores (la RUB o Regin Urbana de Barcelona) unos 6 millones de habitantes. El ncleo central de la ciudad propiamente dicha tiene un milln y medio.     El mejor medio para moverse es sin duda el metro y hay buses descubiertos de 2 pisos para recorridos tursticos muy convenientes. Salen de la Pla?a de Catalunya (Plaza de Catalu?a) en el centro de la ciudad.     Buen viaje!!|`|fe92a230b32f152981c0791beef575d9aa	Lo mejor para disfrutar en BCN es moverse en moto, porque puedes ir por todas partes y ver los edificios preciosos que tiene (como por ejemplo, la Casa Batll, que me maravilla completamente).     Es una ciudad bastante grande, aunque por el trocito del barrio gtico y esa zona se puede ir andando. Pero los planos enga?an, porque la parte alta con sus manzanas cuadradas parece que se puede recorrer andando sin problemas... y NOOOOO!!!! Es enorrrme. Lo que pasa es que tan cuadradito y tan mono parece ms peque?o pero cada manzana de esas es gigante.

7xP8y8npaa	Ciao, anche io in un viaggio ho seguito lo stesso percorso che ti appresti a fare tu , ... e in marzo :) Il clima dovrebbe essere abbastanza simile a quello italiano: ad Atene  probabile che trovi temperature pi alte che non a Micene (che  in collina-montagna) o a Delfi (l salendo lungo il fianco della montagna per arrivare in cima e ammirare la distesa di ulivi avrai modo di sentire meno il freddo, la salita  impegnativa :) ). Per il viaggio  importante che tu abbia il documento d'identit valido per l'espatrio e la tessera sanitaria, un cellulare per comunicare con casa (se hai vodafone ti consiglio di attivare il servizio "vodafone passport",  anche gratuito), pastiglie di zenzero contro il mal d'auto (le strade in montagna non sono le migliori ...) o il mal di mare, disinfettante e cerotti da avere sempre dietro (soprattutto i cerotti), un ombrellino pieghevole (anche in Grecia a volte piove :) ), per l'abbigliamento consiglio di portarti un piumino, che potrai sempre toglierti se far caldo, e almeno un maglione di lana, spazzolino da denti e filo interdentale, un piccolo flaconcino di docciaschiuma (quelli degli alberghi finiscono subito) e una spugna, qualche pacchetto di fazzoletti. La moneta  l'Euro, quindi non dovresti avere problemi da quel punto di vista, inoltre i Greci sono generalmente persone molto gentili e disponibili, molti parlano anche italiano. Ricordati che il fuso orario  diverso, onde evitare telefonate a casa a ore inopportune (i primi giorni telefonavo che qui erano le 7:00 e tutti dormivano ancora :) ).   Spero di esserti stata utile, buona gita :)|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Sono tornata ieri da una gita in grecia..e piu' o meno il percorso era lo stesso...ti posso dire che fino a ieri faceva molto caldo di giorno(andavamo in giro in maniche corte,c'erano tipo 25 gradi...)mentre di sera era un po' freschino(io usavo il cappotto)...  Portati delle scarpe comode perch per vedere i templi c' da camminare abbastanza,le strade sono in salita e non asfaltate.Portati uno zaino per mettere dentro la roba mentre sei in giro.Portati un adattatore per le prese della corrente(nell'albergo in cui eravamo le prese erano solo quelle tedesche).poi vabbh...le cose tipiche da portare:vestiti,intimo,pigiama(ti consiglierei uno di cotone ma con le maniche lunghe),tutto ci che ti serve per lavarti...il cibo  simile al nostro quindi se non sei particolarmente schizzinoso...portati la carta d'identit e la tessera sanitaria(se hai malattie particolari o allergie a farmaci e cibi segnatele su un foglio)...il cibo non costa molto(se ti chiedono 2 euro per una bottiglietta d'acqua lasciagliela l,perch te le fanno pagare 50 cent...)...io mi ero portata dietro 200 euro e sono tornata a casa con 130....

(in primis napoli, poi roma torino e chi pi ne ha pi ne metta)  e poi basta buttare "cacca" sul piatto in cui mangiamo, io non credo che in francia ci sia questo hobby di piazzarsi sul pc e dire "ma roma  meglio di milano" " ma milano  meglio di roma" ...  basta dai....|`|2gwy9ghEaa	Io sono nato e vivo a Milano ed onestamente non  una bella citt, molte zone periferiche sono "addandonate" al degrado ed i servizi non sono poi cos efficienti come vogliono far credere visto che, per esempio, la metropolitana presenta spesso problemi tecnici e disagi per andare a lavoro, senza parlare dell'Ecopass che  una chiara invenzione del Comune per fare soldi.....questa citt offre il lavoro per ha anche tanti problemi!    E' vero che a Milano la gente un p  nervosa, con la puzza sotto al naso e se la mena (non si capisce per cosa), per ci sono anche quelli bravi, quelli leali ed onesti.    Amo l'Italia perch ha tanti bei posti sul piano paesaggistico, culturale ed anche culinario, sicuramente siamo tra i migliori al Mondo, ho visto cittadine molto carine ed ordinate mentre a Milano se vai un p fuori dal centro c' poca cura cos come ho notato nelle altre 3 grandi citt italiane come Torino ma anche Roma e Napoli che, pur essendo 2 bellissime citt, hanno anch'esse dei difetti....    Secondo me sono meglio le citt medie come Parma, Siena, Verona, Trieste, Bergamo....citt pi a misura d'uomo, ordinate e pi facili da gestire!    Milano  viva quando c' il lavoro ma quando, come ieri che era Pasquetta, non c' lavoro manca movimento e si spegne!    Ciao!|`|nuBqdvijaa	il degrado ormai c' in ogni grande citt d'italia, nn solo a milano...   magari informati meglio..|`|1tVzldl9aa	secondo me sei il solito ignorante,razzista e invidioso che non ha altro da fare che criticare Milano e i Milanesi,gente perbene realmente,e non in senso ironico/sarcastico (ammesso che tu conosca il significato di queste parole)    se poi vuoi fare una cosa gradita ed intelligente,stai a casa tua, che di gente come te a Milano non sappiamo cosa farne.....

ZO3wg0S4aa	conviene prenotare il prima possibile, anche sei mesi in anticipo.. se invece manca ormai poco alla partenza (un mese o due) allora conviene aspettare proprio gli ultimissimi giorni, ma  un rischio perch se i voli sono richiesti potresti andare a pagare anche di pi... oppure non trovare disponibilit!|`|c7BJoQBIaa	gli scali mi sfuggono cmq prima prenoti meno paghi...|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	piu' tardi prenoti piu' paghi il biglietto...a meno che non prendi un last minute(ma non sei sicura che ci sia...).Quindi prenota il prima possibile!

Tu usi la postepay come denaro contante e non come forma di garanzia.    La visa electron (cos si chiama la postepay e cos la troverai chiamata in america) ti pu servire solo per pagare al momento ristoranti, negozi o alberghi come se fosse denaro cash.    IMPORTANTE:  Non potrai usarla come forma di garanzia.     NON potrai per esempio:  Molti hotel di lusso prima dell'ingresso in stanza  Affittare un'auto, un camper o un qualsiasi mezzo  Prenotare qualcosa di cui la somma dovuta si conosce solo dopo e non prima.  ecc.    ecco a cosa ti pu servire in america:    La carta postepay ti consente di:     prelevare denaro presso gli ATM bancari che espongono il marchio VISA e VISA Electron, sia in Italia sia all'estero   pagare acquisti in Italia e all'estero negli esercizi commerciali convenzionati VISA e VISA Electron     Costi della postpay in america:    Prelievi presso gli ATM VISA/VISA Electron (paesi non Euro)     5  Pagamenti tramite POS VISA/VISA Electron           gratuiti|`|3e46158f49d6e90a9b3b8a6a17f988e8aa	si e valida|`|EY0LbGSFaa	s i accettata, ma non in tutti essendo una carta prepagata..|`|R1GAdiB8aa	La poste pay  una carta di credito un po' particolare visto che  prepagata.

Non mi fiderei molto ad utilizzarla come carta di credito normale. Ti conviene una Visa normale che  accettata ovunque.|`|tiNKy5CQaa	Cancerina180 ha dato una risposta pi che esauriente.

AA11441260	95%of the females i know who love to go dancing socializing with other males have broken homes, jumping in one relationship to another.

Their wives are with them too, with their kids =). The dance was fun and it was sort of an exercise too.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	This happened to you? And yes its ok, you promise each other love and faithfulness not being by each others side 24/7|`|iI6DJaFOaa	I 100% agree with the answer above. You don't have to be with her 24/7.

You are going to and from the place together, and then you'll each have something new to talk about over drinks afterward (or breakfast).    It would be better if the guy learned to dance, and asked the lady to dance once in awhile. Also, if she took a break and chatted with the friends, that would be a good thing too (unless it's all guy talk -- then I guess it would be hard to do).    Not ideal, but better than a lot of things.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Why don't you take up ballroom dancing instead so you can dance with your wife and not leave her to a DI?  Much more fun than to be left alone too to your drinking buddies.    Anyway, if it's okay with you and your wife to do your separate thing i.e. she to her dancing and you to your chatting and drinking then, I don't think there's a problem.  It's all about mutual understanding really.    It also happens to me in a party.  My husband to his buddies while I to my "amigas".

And they been having them for a long time.  Probably just as long as we have been having proms.  I don't think Hollywood has anything to do with this one.  And watch out - American's may not be the Imperial ones for long, China's quite close on our tails.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	It depends on the school. I had a prom at the end of secondary school (UK) in 2004, and lots of other people seemed to cos there were lots of limos going to hotels at around the same time. I think most schools in the UK do now, actually, but yeah it is quite a recent thing so I assume it's copied from american tv + films. The only thing is most schools don't let you bring anyone from a different year or school as a 'date' (only about 10 people went as couples, so the whole date thing wasn't given any importance), so schools that are all same-sex tend to just have boring sit down meals instead.|`|be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	I've never heard them called a Prom in my part of Australia, and we only called our 'proms' Formals up until year 11 (second last year of high school).

Definitely definitely do Barcelona.  Also, I've heard that Rio can be a little dangerous.  But as a single girl in Europe I felt fine in Bar?a.

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	I'm assuming this is a monthly wage. 15000kr after tax, yes. 15000kr before tax, not comfortably. It's possible, but difficult, and you wouldn't be able to afford any luxuries.    A small studio in a smaller city can cost as little as 1500kr/month, but more likely you will be paying 2500-4000kr/month.    Utilities, including phone and internet, may be 1500+, depending on your habits.    Food is at minimum 1500kr, more likely 2000-2500kr.    Transportation cards, even in rural areas, are usually at least 600kr. A car would be out of the question.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Is this as a week's pay, a month's pay, a year's salary, or your entire life's savings?  And what do you consider to be living fine?

I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to park it in a long term car park whilst you are hiring it.    Are you sure it's not cheaper de-hire at the airport and then re-hire it when you get back.  Or if the rental company have an presence at the airport you could always ask them if you can park the car there for free/reduced price.    If you are looking for other good airport parking deals, try www.purpleparkin.co.uk  They do must of the major airports in the UK at pretty much the most competative price.
zBWefnYHaa	As you have already paid the big lot, you would need money for lunch, dinner and sightseeing.  Sightseeing, if you plan on about $40 per adult per day, you should be able to make it, that is mostly entry to 2 museums and a tour or 2 of the more expensive things. The ones you name are not the cheapest ones in town, so if you feel that is too much, you can easily spend less and still fill your days.    For lunch, you can buy a loaf of bread and some nice spreads, enough to feed the three of you for about $5, or you can go to a moderate restaurant and spend $20 each.   Same for dinner, but that tend to be more expensive, up to $50 per person, more possible.  So if you are feeling the costs get out of hand, eat a nice hot dinner in a cheap place like a department store or small cafe/pub and buy bread for dinner.  If you plan on a lot of traveling within the cities, the cards that cover all your local travel costs are a good deal.    Having said that, I usually spend about 150 Euro per day, traveling along, (at the current exchange rates that is about $US 190,) including my place to sleep, as Paris and London are expensive. In Amsterdam I spend more in shopping but less in food, but it is near my home and I know all the little, cheap places for lunch and dinner, or I eat home and just spend a couple of hours in town.    I do normally not do several expensive museums per day and keep most of my meals moderate. I guess that about 80 to 100 Euro are for spending money.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Take as much money as you can muster, at least $200 per day per person.  I hear Europe is mighty expensive these days.  If you get a chance while in Paris, stop by the Palace of Versailles.

You are not allowed to use the phone unless you have an "airplane mode" which prevents any wireless transmission and phone calls.

You can (and may) use it on the plane while sitting waiting to leave the gate. They will tell you to turn everything off when they close the door.

bK9YS2kpaa	Paquetes turisticos con esas ciudades que dices es algo dificil de encontrar,pero lo que si puedo es orientarte un poco con respecto a tu viaje.    Si vas a viajar de Bs As a Santiago (que es donde esta el aeropuerto internacional y es donde llegan los buses de Bs As) tienes la opcion de hacerlo en avion, para lo cual puedes chequear las tarifas de la empresa Gol, que son muy convenientes, y puedes encontrar tarifas desde la mitad de lo que las otras aerlineas ofrecen, ahi te demorarias como 1.50,ahora si kieres venir en bus, toma toda la noche desde Bs As a Mendoza y de ahi son como 7 horas para llegar a Santiago.    Una vez en Santiago, si quieres ir a Vi?a del Mar, vas a la terminal de buses, ahi tienes para elegir entre diferentes empresas,pero la mas recomendable por su servicio es Tur Bus o Pullman Bus, ambas llegan directamente a la ciudad de Vi?a del Mar.    Con respecto a Isla de Pascua, te quiero decir algo, el boleto de avion es bastante caro, y realmente no vale la pena gastar todo ese dinero en un viaje ahi, porque la isla la conoces al reves y al derecho en dos dias, y que harias de ahi?pues nada, si quieres una recomedacion, no te pierdas el sur de Chile, que esta hermoso.    Buena suerte  Ojala te sirvan estos datos.|`|WB5roPmZaa	Hola.. en cualquier agencia de turismo te van a informar y pasarte los precios..yo fui y en 1 semana  mas o menos recorrimos todo ..suerte|`|29432eacd80ff1bf37a63b2d2288d214aa	A mi tambin me interesa el destino de Isla de Pascua.  La segunda respuesta que te dan es cierta, es costoso el viaje de Santiago a la Isla. Sin embargo, un paquete te lleva por el mismo precio, solo que buscando, y hay fechas en las cuales es ms econmico o cuando ofrecen esos precios.     Tambin es cierto que es un destino para estar unos 4 dias porque la isla es peque?a.     En octubre noviembre he visto buenos precios para este destino.    En despegar.com chile, entras y quiz te convenga el precio en avin, suelen aparecer buenos precios en vuelos. Tambin lo puedes hacer en despegar.com argentina . Esto para el tramo Bs AS a Santiago. Aunque tambin para la isla.     me han comentado que es un viaje muy lindo de Mendoza a Santiago por micro. En tiempo, unas 8 horas, aunque en estas fechas por la nieve dudo que sea buena opcin.    Con respecto a Vi?a, hay viajes de un dia, las agencias te llevan, no recuerdo si el precio es cercano a los 40 dolares. Habria que checar, puesto que por el rumbo no se si hay una casa de Pablo Neruda, habria que preguntar. Porque el viaje que hice no me incluy la casa de Pablo N.  Si gustas puedes viajar por tu cuenta y buscar un hospedaje por tu cuenta, pero no es muy barato tampoco. Si vas a la ciudad que est antes de Vi?a, no dejes de subir al mirador, por una especie de trenecito que hay ,  ascensores creo que le llaman.  Suerte.

We were living in Baguio and was able to put my brother and I through college (I even went to 1 year Medicine)! The cook/maid thing though, I think it could be a little more, but that is if you give them room and board (they stay with you in the house and you provide their food, etc.). I am now in US Air Force stationed in Florida (deployed in Qatar now)... but yes, you can live off 3700/month. But then your father is old, so if he starts to need medical help or hospitalization, etc... it might be a little tight??? But yes, it would be a lot easier in the Philippines than anywhere else.|`|eDjiOWKtaa	with $3700 a month, it's not exactly living like a king... but you can live a modest but comfortable life with a maid that can also cook.    you can afford to live in a very nice 2-bedroom, 1 -bathroom unit in Metro Manila's finest apartments at either Makati or Fort Bonifacio rolling in a nice car... but that's right smack in the middle of Metro Manila.    a lot of Americans already live in places that best describe your wants of an inexpensive lifestyle in-between rural and the city (Angeles City or Olonggapo City).    you may want to head south of Metro Manila in places like Cavite or Laguna... or live in an another island that's much better than living in Metro Manila like Cebu City.|`|OmHC6d3Jaa	If you consider a five bedroom apartment with 3 bathrooms, and a maid and cook as living like a king, then yes you can on 3700 dollars a month.    Just keep the following things in mind: make sure you allocate money for healthcare costs for your dad, which can spin out of control there; and a quality education for you, which is never free in the country. Also seek out a very safe neighborhood, and this can be a challenge while at the same time trying to keep housing costs down.|`|zcG9jBJQaa	Definitely yes.|`|AA11824372	Yes, it would be possible to live like a King at $3700 a month.

Although then 1999 it was  indeed $30 or Php1500.

The filipino people are generally much poorer. So, generally speaking, although your income won't change you will now be surrounded with people of lower income. If this makes you feel like a king then yes, you will be living like a king.    there are lots of positive things about living in the philippines. i'm sure you have found many of these things out already if you plan on moving there.    at the risk of sounding anti-filipino i think you should be warned of some of the negative things. don't get me wrong, i love the philippines but every place has good and bad.    so here's some of the bad....    law enforcement is almost non-existent. you need to pick a very secure neighborhood to live in and always be aware of your surroundings.    if you look non-filipino you will be a target of criminals. you are rich. there is no way to convince them otherwise.    if a crime happens dont expect much help, if any help at all. expect the police to have the attitude of "you are lucky you are a foreigner. you can just replace everything." i was actually told this when trying to report everything in my home was stolen. the cop couldnt be bothered to even fill out a report.    you need to have a plan for your father's health care. he is 73 and wont be around forever. he will get sick eventually. this is a third world country. if he has a heart attack or a stroke the chances of him even making to the hospital are much, much lower. if he does make it the care given to him may not be up to western standards. you also need to prove you can pay for the services given before they will help your dad. this can be a big problem for a 12 year old.    the quality of education in the philippines isnt very good. while there are very smart filipinos the chances of them having a good education are not great. you will definately want to go to a private school and some of these can be very costly.    just like any other country, there are scam artists that will prey upon vulnerable people. as a foreigner you are seen as vulnerable. as an elderly foreigner you father will extremely vulnerable. as a young foreigner you will be seen as extremely vulnerable. you will encounter scam artists on a regular basis.    its their country. no matter what happens you will be wrong. for instance, if there is a traffic accident you are at fault. it doesnt matter what the truth is.    be prepared for people to say bad things about you in a language you dont understand while smiling to your face.     again, sorry for being negative. the philippines is a nice place and i choose to live here. like anyplace, the philippines does have its negative points.

1gffG5V3aa	http://www.standbyrelocs.com is a specialist company that offers relocations which are one way trips from major cities to get vans to people who rent them at full price. If you check it out today for example they have Auckland to Christchurch - 7 days at just $5 a day!    So you check a brilliant camper with everything you need. They are usually Maui or Britz campers. Why pay full price. Most the deals seem to be running from South to North so I would try and fly into Christchurch if I were you.    Renting from Maui or Britz you are looking at about $100 a day.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	The 2 main companies are Britz/maui and apollo campervans.I love campervanning as one can pull up to the most beautiful areas and enjoy in comfort make some lunch or just laze about for a while. but if the weather is cold then its not much fun sleeping in one .

In NZ there's not always cheap accommodation available near the areas you want, and it's a bit of a pain always checking in/checking out. Don't camp unless you're hard core, since it can get pretty cold at night in the South Island. I went in summer and froze my little feet :) However, their camp sites are quite good and have shower facilities and the like.    Maui vans are nice, but a bit pricey. Avis and Budget operate in NZ-plus there are private lenders of vans and 4x4's. I'd recommend a 4 wheel drive for NZ: if you wish to get off the beaten track, plus they're great for packing in all your gear comfortably if you can't afford the van.     Try price comparisons online...and book quickly, Those things go like hotcakes.|`|o65klEwWaa	Hiring a camper works out to be about the same cost per day as staying in motels in popular tourist spots. About $200-500 per day. For motel option, you need to add on the cost of a car (?). Alternatively you need to add on the cost of the campsite, about $40/day.    Obviously staying in a hostel is a lot cheaper than a motel, so I think this is the cheaper option, even with a hire-car. Even cheaper would be to forget the car and go for a hop on/hop off bus. Don't recommend hitch-hiking.    If you feel comfortable driving it, I'd get a camper. If you stay in a motel, you are less likely to meet people, whereas you will meet people in a campground. If you can't afford it, then you'll have fun staying at hostels too,.     Hertz, Avis and Budget are the main car rentals. But there are loads of cheaper places, although they may not have pick-up points at airports. You can find companies online at www.yellow.co.nz or google it. Good luck.

If you will visit during Holy week period it won't be a problem because there will be tons of groups by the mountain who will have guides and there will also be several guides who can/will offer their services. But be warned that during Holy Week there will be tons and tons and tons of people going there. I suggest you stay/sleep over in Lucena City (the nearest City before Mt. Banahaw i think), there are several small hotels there and ask the staff. People from Lucena City are naturally friendly and accomodating, plus it is not too much of a city life in a sense that someone always knows someone else who can help you with something, which in your case is getting a guide :) while you're at it visit Kamay ni Hesus as well in Lucban Quezon, about an hour away from Lucena City. It is also very popular during Holy Week....|`|sCiuv7n3aa	Dont worry there are native people living near that area... you could hire them      I went there during my field trip during 3rd year High School.... it was a fun and full of religion topics.

That is why it costs more.  Charlotte is a hub for US Airways and since there are more airlines servicing that city and more competition among airlines on that route, the ticket price to Charlotte is lower.  US Airways may also be having a special on that route.

Here's a link that explained it all to me!  http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bluemoon1...    Hope it helps!  =]    Samantha Jo~|`|AA11828341	Explanation: How often does a full moon occur twice in a single month? Exactly once in a Blue Moon. In fact, the modern usage of the term "Blue Moon" refers to the second Full Moon in a single month. Tonight's Blue Moon will be the first since November 2001. A Blue Moon typically occurs every few years. The reason for the rarity of the Blue Moon is that the 29.53 days between full moons is just slightly shorter than the number of days in the average month. Don't, however, expect the moon to look blue tonight! The term "Blue Moon" has recently been traced to an error in a magazine article in 1946. It is possible for the Moon to appear tinged by a blue hue, sometimes caused by fine dirt circulating in the Earth's atmosphere, possibly from a volcanic explosion. The above picture was taken not during a full moon but through a morning sky that appeared dark blue (see the link below for photo). The bright crescent is the only part directly exposed to sunlight - the rest of the Moon glows from sunlight reflected from the Earth. In this dramatic photo, however, the planet Jupiter is also visible along with its four largest moons.|`|AA10976046	Rhythm, it is as most say.   When a Second full Moon occurs in the same month, the second Full Moon is a " Blue Moon" . This is an uncommon feature.   So, the adage, once in a Blue Moon.|`|4613ee081978cfca43dfec44c2b2d14caa	When you hear someone say "Once in a Blue Moon" you know what they mean: Rare. Seldom. Maybe even absurd. After all, when was the last time you saw the moon turn blue?    According to modern folklore, a Blue Moon is the second full moon in a calendar month. Usually months have only one full moon, but occasionally a second one sneaks in. Full moons are separated by 29 days, while most months are 30 or 31 days long; so it is possible to fit two full moons in a single month. This happens every two and a half years, on average.|`|7ONAv4vYaa	It is not really blue.    If the month has two full moons. The second full moon of the month is called the blue moon.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	it's not blue at all... they just call it blue... big blue moon...|`|fk8wXA3Saa	A blue moon is really just 2 full moons in the same month .|`|iTktGWWtaa	What is a "Blue Moon"?    For more than half a century, whenever two full Moons appeared in a single month (which happens on average every 2 1/2 to 3 years), the second has been christened a "Blue Moon." In our lexicon, we describe an unusual event as happening "Once in a Blue Moon." This expression was first noted back in 1821 and refers to occurrences that are uncommon, though not truly rare.     On past occasions, usually after vast forest fires or major volcanic eruptions, the Moon has reportedly taken on a bluish or lavender hue. Soot and ash particles, propelled high into the Earth's atmosphere, can sometimes make the Moon appear bluish.|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	Made of Blue Cheese.|`|8eeKI0h0aa	A "blue" moon is when you get two full moons in the one calender month. Since the lunar cycle is approx. 29 days you can see this is not a frequent event.....cheers|`|AA11494685	If you have look at a moon regularly you will notice that sometimes it looks light blue and this happens just once in a while.  That is why the phrase once in a blue moon.

Round, transparent drops of water refract and internally reflect some sunlight towards the observer. Different wavelengths of light refract (change angles) at different angles, so the white light of the sun is parsed into an orderly band of colors.      A high density of waves emerges traveling in the direction of least deviation from the entry angle, and it is these waves that create the rainbow.    As these insubstantial pageants are but light and water, dont go searching for the touchdown spot. The optical phenomenon depends upon you being situated a distance from the droplets, with the sun at your back.|`|iTktGWWtaa	Who said? I found it, lagi!

l9RDuthbaa	Most malls have a food court.  In almost all of the malls it's just all the fast-food stores in one hall.  In a typical Israeli food court you'll find McDonald's (or some other buger place), Sbarro (or some other pizza place), Fallafel/Shawarma, Thai food, and an ice-cream place.  Typical meal price-range is 30-50 sheqels.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Yes, in the lower level of any mall in Israel there exists a food court.  You can get a falafal in a pita for 10 shekels.  Make sure when you order any food tell them to put a lot of "hareef" inside.  Tasty.|`|4D7cuMZ0aa	those pics look yummy  but I don't think they do|`|zw1chGmHaa	How pleasant; someone who actually asks a question about travel.    I haven't been to Israel because I am not allowed to go.  Though I have a U.S. passport, it is invalidated for travel to Israel to protect my residence permit for Lebanon.      But my sister and husband were there and said the food - especially in the Arab quarters - is excellent.  Not sure if these constitute food courts, but in Lebanon, we have whole streets where restaurants abound and are the equivalent to the food courts in Singapore - even cleaner, too.  I'm sure you can find that in Israel.
ji7gqCWxaa	Not once, not even the UAE, where almost everyone fails the first time because of the very strict rules they have.  I learned driving at the age of 10. it was during 1982  Israeli occupation; we had a car in the house, my father was at work, and Israel started to air strike the area. I didn't know how it happened, but half an hour later, I found myself in Beirut, with my mother and sister in the car, telling me that I drove all the way from Aramoun, in the mountains.

lYQDCJgeaa	SOME Orthodox Jews believe they are not to re-enter the "Promised Land" (Palestine) until the Messiah comes.  Still waiting...    Others do not follow that.  There are as many interpretations of Judaism as there are Jews.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	That's pure bullshit.  The Torah didn't fortell the holocaust either.  There is only one sect that denies the viability of the State of Israel that live in Israel:  Neutrei Karta.  They are looked at as crazy by most other religious Israelis.  The religious Jews in the U.S. don't want to give up their comparatively easy lives in America in order to live in Israel (They would have to suffer financially greatly.) So they just rationalize their real reason away. They visit Israel all the time.  So what's up with that?  There is another reason to rationalize their inhibition to live in Israel though.  The Lubavicher Rebbe (Schneerson, G-d rest his soul), said that if you can't get to Jerusalem, make the place where you are your own Jersusalem (or something to that effect).|`|xUDPwUdIaa	most orthodox jews don't believe that. there is a very small sect in israel (the largest sect of these orthodox jews live in the new york city area). they are an extremist group and cannot be compared to the rest of the population. just as there are many sects of Christianity, there are many sects of Judaism as well!|`|RAZ7yUUQaa	All Jews believe in living in Eretz yisrael (Israel),But some, mainly Satmar Hasidim,  believe there should't be a Jewish rulership in the land until the Messiah comes. (I'm an orthodox Jew in NY who plans on living there one day). As for where being mentioned in the Torah, it is mentioned numerous times that god will give the land to the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob  (i e the Jews). Hope this answer helps : )|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	Religiously speaking, 99% of orthodox Jews believe in Israel. Satmar and NK are less than 1% of religious Jews. I don't know what you mean by modern Jews. Both are modern, religious or secular. If this is some kind of attempt to say religious jews are primitive, please refrain from doing so. In The Tanach it does say that the land of Cannan belongs to the descendents of Abraham, but it gets complicated........    'Dwell in this land [the Land of Israel]. When the promise of the hereafter [End of Days] comes to be fulfilled, We [Allah] shall assemble you [the Israelites] all together [in the Land  of Israel]."    (chapter 17:100-104)    Then you have    Moreover - and those who try to use Islam as a weapon against Israel always conveniently ignore this point - the Holy Qur'an explicitly refers to the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel before the Last Judgment - where it says: "And thereafter We [Allah] said to the Children of Israel: 'Dwell securely in the Promised Land. And when the last warning will come to pass, we will gather you together in a mingled crowd.'" [Qur'an 17:104]    This is an odd passage because from what I understand, the torah doesn't have this idea. Nor does it have any idea against this idea.  The idea of  jewish state in the torah is not the same as we have now in the middle east. This passage is basically saying jews should live in that land and before judgment the rest will return. The majority of jews do not want to live in Israel because of all its enemies.        I don't get it. I answered your question that most orthodox jews do support the state of israel therefore how is your question valid. LOOK UP NK they are less than 1% of orthodox jews.|`|8vMmUbcqaa	One has a big nose the other a very big nose|`|14BXajh0aa	Well, to being Jewish has nothing to do with a race and is more so a religion. Judaism. Orthodox Judaism is to practice the religion as it was in it's earliest forms. The are Jewish Ethiopians known as the Falasha ( Also see the Orthodox Coptic Church)that live outside of Addis Abbaba which more than likely follow the laws of the Judaism more than any other group of Jews. Also, there are more books included in the practice of Judaism beside the Torah....to sum it up the difference between the two has been lost in the shuffle of history.|`|CH62r7qXaa	As to the first part of your question: the assumption is completely false.  I am an Orthodox Jew, and I am profoundly grateful to the Creator for the fact that we have the opportunity to live in Israel today.  I do see the State of Israel as being seriously flawed, but that does not lessen my gratitude for the fact that we have it at all, and it only increases my own personal determination to make it a better place.  There are some fringe Orthodox groups who are opposed to the State of Israel, but they are a tiny minority.  You just see a lot about them because they are newsworthy - Jews against Israel!    As to the reason why we believe it's our land, the questioner is referred to the Torah (i.e. the 5 books of Moses), specifically Genesis, where G-d promises the Land to Abraham, to Isaac (*not* Ishmael), and Jacob (*not* Esau).  Follow that up with the story of the Exodus, where G-d repeatedly promises to bring the Children of Israel to the land He promised to their forefathers, and Deuteronomy, where Moses waxes lyrical in praise of the land and the obligation of Jews to live there.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, when you live in Manhattan you don't need a car or take a taxi to around the borough. In particular, you don't need a car at all to get anywhere in New York City. This city has the largest public transit system in country, which is about twice the side of LA Metro System. You have a lot of transportation option to get around Manhattan and the rest of NYC.    In regard to sports athletes, they have their on driver to take them from the apartment or suburban home to the Garden, Yankee and Shea Stadium.    I hope this information is very helpful.

AA11904002	Well, there are two sides of this issue.   First there are chauvinist bastards, which I hate for not only their extreme devotion to their own sex, but also the hypocrisy they commit. Most of these guys fool around with other girls and even their fathers encourage it. They brag about it saying "my son is a stud.." or "my little boy has now become a man..."  etc..    But when it comes to the daughter, they would never ever let them act the same. Accusing them with being unchaste. The same attitude goes for the bride to be too. They like the bride "untouched".    Than there are those "turkeyismyheart" has described above.    Personally, I have a tendency towards the second group.    And just to be clear, I don't classify women "clean" and "unclean" according to their sexual experience.|`|p1n1ViwIaa	Elena, I want s3x with you     grrrrr|`|DP3rQkrtaa	It is their culture I am pretty sure. Not only Turkey pretty much all Middle east countries and India want virgins. Family respect issues and all. But we don't think like that in America, do we?|`|NirBfNfMaa	Chauvinistic double-standards are cute? Hmmm...    "Easy is an adjective used to describe a woman who has the sexual morals of a man." ~Nancy Linn-Desmond     Lol sorry I'm not trying to be mean to you by saying that.     But it is quite a double standard that is a slippery slope which leads to forcing women to believe that their self-worth is tied solely to the condition of their hymen and nothing else.    There was actually a court case in France where a man wanted to divorce his new wife on the grounds that she had lied about a "desirable trait." The man found out that his wife had not been a virgin at marriage. This caused an uproar in France, because it violated their secular rules and it would be the beginning of a dangerous path that would compromise France's equality between men and women. France's court struck this down, underlining that a woman's virginity was not to be considered a desirable trait for a basis of divorce.    Trust me. Chauvinism isn't cute, it is dangerous to men and woman's equality.    And I tell you this in the nicest way possible. You're one of my contacts and I mean no disrespect to you.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	No.    I know at least one person who really doesn't "want a virgin". That's me.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au02p8huO...|`|2yOxIYLkaa	Arent Christians supposed to be virgins until marriage btw?    Im sure the VAST majority of the western christian population have broken this very important christian rule.    And no i wouldnt turn down a woman just because shes had sex before.|`|x79VCZsNaa	mmm why do you think just Turkish men thinks like that, did you not read the news where a american girl sold her virginity for 2 or 3 million dollars? and it was not a middle east men who pay that money was a western Australian!!! if western men do not care about that why the girl got alot of proposals and she was able to get alot of money for a alleged virginity that may be she corrected by a simply plastic surgery? and btw why there are a lot of plastic surgeries doing this kind of surgeries in western countries?|`|vbTG3a4Zaa	i think its the parents that prefer virgin for their son|`|AA10604976	There are more than 70 million people living in Turkey, nearly half of them men. Some young men do say they prefer virgins, some don't give a damn. And no, I haven't personally made a poll to find out. I just scan eksisozluk (a popular web site) from time to time.|`|AA11854330	Nope, it changes.  Being a virgin is important because they think that those girls are 'pure' or 'clean', I mean for marriage.|`|HiHQvqodaa	Not all, but a lot of them do. That's because they tend to be possessive over their women, and a woman who has slept with another man is considered "damaged/second-hand goods". So there's nothing "cute" about it, really.    The funny thing is, men's obsession with virginity doesn't stop girls from doing whatever they want. (You can do a lot of things without damaging your hymen, and even if it does get damaged, it's easy to get it "fixed" surgically.) It just forces girls into sexual hypocrisy.|`|OJWApbmbaa	Typically yes because of Islam and their culture in which women must remain virgins till married. The whole thing is stupid to me that a man won't marry a non-virgin besides so many girls in the Middle East now a days do the same stuff as men but get their hymens repaired or fake their virginity using sheeps liver. The whole thing is really sad.|`|VcIYeMcyaa	lol you are funny and it's not just turkish men... i am an Albanian man..   and i also do want that.. and of course i always get what i want.. here is my 2cents.. ok first of all if you did not know now you will.. when a woman is a virgin she will 99% of the times fall in love with you.. and want to be with you until you prove to be 1 a moron 2 a user.. and then they just move on.. my gf was a virgin and i loved her before we ever got anywhere near that subject.. i only found out that night.. so my point is most guys think this way.. if she's a virgin i get to pop that you know what.. and she will be mine.. and since i know turkish men.. from Turkey i mean.. that's the mentality over there.. as far as the north americans go well they just want to pop it.. simple (lives in Canada) so yeah i fall in that region.oh and one more thing.. they belive that a virgin is easier.. in which case they are mostly correct.. and i do speak from personal experience.. just dont hate me.. i'm only answering.|`|f5772527c1bdb988f613cb36fe20d4eaaa	It all depends.  The majority of the Turkish men could care less.  All that matters to them is the GIRL that they're marrying...not how many times they've done it.  However, there's a small minority of guys who believe that it's traditional to marry a virgin, because it's considered "clean."  As I recall *eh hem* the U.S. is very similar.

It is because they want to share their honeymoon with someone special, and be their first person. That kind of thing.

It's not a taboo but we are not comfortable as other europeans. But its changing in these days. Turkish people are much and much confortable all about sex.     willing to have a virgin, bahh this is just from old times. Altough some blockhead still want their girlfriends to be a ****, but thier wifes to be saints, much of the youth would not care in nowadays.    We all know that having sex is one of the common things in human instinct and life. So having sex with lots of girls before marriage and then wishing for a pure virgin would be so idiotic.    I'd like my wife to be a virgin of course, but i dont care too much really, because I can't blame her for what she did before me, and there is nothing to blame. Much of the Turkish youth thinks the same. We are modern dont confuse us wth other undeveloped muslim nations.    Meanwhile, moonlight, what are you a terrorist lover puritan. it seems so.    Hey pops, unfortunately we have some blockheads like this in our country, who call themselves muslim but just puritans, and because of this much of you know us turkish people very differently as we are, I hate this.    We have nothing to do with terrorist order who kill people in the name of religion.

58EydBwwaa	Cartagena is far more beautiful and well-preserved, but there isn't a lot to do other than walk around and admire the beautiful architechture. The beach is dirty, and the nightlife is absolute rubbish! Plus, to stay in the city center, you will pay an arm, a leg, and your firstborn child.     Bahia has amazing beaches, great nightlife and wonderful wonderful food.     Both have nearby islands which are lovely. Playa Blanca near Cartagena, and Morro de Sao Paulo in Bahia. I prefer Morro de Sao Paulo. The people are more friendly and the atmosphere just more joyful in general.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	been to both, cartagena is definitely better.
dpKntiZoaa	Here are the minimum salary levels for countries in Europe -> http://www.fedee.com/minwage.html    Can a 'Schengen' person work?  I don't know what you mean by this. If you are holding a Schengen visa, then you do not hold an EU passport and this means that you cannot legally work in any of the EU member states, without changing your immigration status (ie, obtaining a work permit for the applicable country).     If you do hold an EU passport (with some exceptions for Romanians/Bulgarians), then you are free to work within any of the countries in the EU    Norway is not part of the EU, but is an EEA member which has signed up to permit freedom of workers and thus allows EU members to search for work. http://www.norway.org.uk/travel/gettingt...    Switzerland has the same bilateral agreement with the EU and therefore allows EU passport holders to search for work http://www.ch.ch/private/00054/00055/005...    "Schengen" therefore has little correlation with the right to work.  It is used in relation with the right to travel on one visa within this zone, for travel only and not working.  However, to answer your question - Yes Switzerland has joined the Schengen zone on 12th Dec 2008 http://www.swissemigration.ch/aktuell/sw...    Cyprus, however is not (yet) a member of the Schengen zone.|`|qq5nceCXaa	Many European countries have a minimum wage rate, though there are significant differences in the structure of the legislation and coverage any such protection gives.    A EU or EA citizen can work in any other EU/EEA country without a work visa, though you may need to obtain a residence permit in some countries.  again there are restrictions, particularly for workers from the "new" states as some countries have restricted work permits for these.    Switzerland is in the Schengen area, Cyprus is not|`|uZEjs4FHaa	Sweden does not have a minimum salary set by legislation.   These matters are left to employers, employees and labor unions to agree upon.  The labor unions are very strong in Sweden, yet there are very few strikes compared to many other European countries.    The average salary is probably lower than in USA, and the taxes are higher, but there are other benefits, like free health care and education etc.  The difference between rich and poor is also much less than in USA.

fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	Depends on when you come here. If its in the winter, I'd go for inside stuff such as the arch, brewery tour, science center or city museum. If the weather is warmer then you could consider things like the zoo or even Grants Farm and Six Flags when both of them open for the summer season.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Do the arch, go to the zoo, Grant's Farm, tons of stuff!|`|H5JYpaQcaa	You could go to the St. Louis Arch, the Art Museum (I'm not that into art, but it was definitely interesting!), the Science Center, maybe seeing a show at the Fox Theatre, or going to a sporting event.  I don't suggest going to the Zoo, as it is all outside except for a few exhibits (like the sea animals and stuff, which they keep FREEZING!).  Also, Union Station (one of the malls downtown) is a waste unless you want to just go to some vintage-type stores, as there are little to no chain stores, which I find boring.  St. Louis is a very fun city, and if you are planning to leave St. Louis by coming through IL, there is a restaurant in Fairview Hights called Lotta Watta Creek, which is amazing!|`|BD7yd8D4aa	Brewery tour, city museum, attractions at Forest Park, Laclede's Landing (bars), Washington Ave. (clubs).

Do Lunch and dinner at an original downtownrestaurantt. I suggest Kemoll's. It's located on the 40th floor of the Metropolatin Square. Looks really great! This is that resturaunt's web site: http://www.kemolls.com/index.php Also you could go shopping at many of St. Louis's Malls: the Gallaria, West County Center, Plaza Frontenac, and Chesterfield are the ones worth going to. The Gallaria and Plaza Frontenac are closest to downtown, but my favorite is West County. Plaza Frontenac is more high-end with Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue as its department stores.    Museum people- Go to the St. Louis Science Center, the Zoo, or Grant's farm. . .  I don't know how ideal museums are for a trip with your boyfriend..    Also, you could go to six flags.. .    HOPE I'VE HELPED!|`|2HFqoUPcaa	Arch and the zoo .|`|RFK9sG6zaa	As a former airline tour agent (me) I can honestly say St. Louis has got so much stuff going on your question almost can't be answered unless you break it down.  We need to see some of your hobbies, like's and dis-like's.  Without sounding dumb I must advise you to try and work around rush-hour-traffic.  If you get caught in it you'll see what I mean.  There were times and days when I ran a  cab I could almost get out and talk for a bit with car's around me.  St. Louis city, county and surrounding area's make up approximately "800+ sq. miles."  And it's nothing for some of the locals to get up (like I've done) at 3:00 A.M. to get to work at 6:00 A.M. driving 90+ miles (back roads, freeway & some city streets).  So stay away from driving between 4:00 A.M. - 9:30 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. - 5:45 P.M. or expect sloooooooow going !!    If you have time call, as many airline tour office's and ask them to mail out as much info as possible.  This way you'll have a ballpark idea what's going on.      Sorry I could not be more help.  But I know what your about to go thru an know your "dog's are going to be barking when you get home."  (Your feet will be tired from walking so much).

8oR9HPxPaa	It means that you cannot get off the plane in the middle of the journey (connecting airport) and continue your journey at a later time. Like flying from New York to los angeles through Atlanta. getting off the plane in atlanta, and catching a random flight to LA, not your scheduled one.|`|mX27tszPaa	The person who answered the question before me is right.  It really means that you can't get off the airplane so you honestly want to avoid this.  It's much more of a hassle than a couple plane changes instead of a non stop flight.  I put a link to an eHow article below on how to get discount airline tickets that might help you.

rvTcDJ6yaa	You can get a museum pass which includes the Louvre and many others things...I found it handy as I did not have to queue ( not sure where exactly I bought the pass from but there are places scattered around Paris where you can..I think it might have been on the underpass to the arc de triumphe..not sure if that was included in it)    I went to Paris is feb when it was mainly overcast...not too cold either ( i got away with 2 thin layers of clothing, gloves and scarf and hat at times).  Less people around, but it might have been nicer to go in spring when its supposed to be great.  I didn't eat in too many resteraunts mainly because translations was hard ( no english menus)....so i had take aways...BAD!!!!  It cost me around 20euros for evening meals in resteraunts, with breakfast its included in hotels for the vast majority ( so I would eat big then to fill up)  I never got eurorail..i just took trains when I wanted as I was living in the UK and going on regular holidays ( trips) to europe every 6 weeks or so.....so can't hel you with prices there.    Italy is lovely ...lots of places to go here.  I did some guided tours in Paris to versailles which I found worthwhile as I learnt about the place more..I also did one to Pompeii from Rome which was also very good...I know that I pre booked a couple of day tours ( i usually did one per trip) thru www.viator.com....but you can sometimes book within the city at kiosks or if you stumble upon them go and check out what they have to offer. viator at least gives you some options at what you can do in each place as well and you can either do it yourself or book a tour.....up to you.'  I had decent food in Italy and again it was around 20euros for an evening meal in an average resteraunt...but that will obviously depend on where you go..and that was 4years ago now...prices may have got more.  try www.skyscanner.net for flights as you can get some cheap ones and you might find it cheaper to fly.

They are allowed only an eighth grade education, and the men are given a choice of either being a farmer or a carpenter.  The women, on the other hand, are allowed only to be wives and mothers.  They are the property of their husbands and have absolutely no rights whatsoever.  There is no indoor plumbing, no electricity, and the women are expected to use their free-time either baking bread for sale on Saturdays at a road-side stand, or weaving baskets for the same road-side stands.  All the money goes to the husband, by the way.  Sundays are a day of rest--for the men.  The women are required to do all of their normal chores on Sunday as well as see to that their husband gets his rest.    If you think that would be fun for a week or two, imagine having to do it forever.

To say that life is unfair is to say that people purposefully get an unfair hand in life. The reality is that humans are unfair and societies are unfair. Life just continues regardless of anyone.  But if by life you mean the human condition, then yes life is completely unfair. Some people never work, eat the best food, travel around the world and can buy anything they want. Other people slave away on farms, in factories, or worse brothels. There are people who have to walk for miles to get drinking water while other people pay money to buy water cause they don't want tap water.    On that note, you should read some Camus. He shows that even the most content and privileged people can be struck down by life and experience tragedy. That no human is immune to the absurdity of life.   So this brings me to my initial point. Life is neither fair or unfair. Even the most lucky can experience the worst of life. Existing is all about chance, and because of this fact thinking about fair and unfair is arbitrary.|`|v3gDnMydaa	life is def.UNFAIR.

Nearby were some Palestinians with guns and I shouted at them "shoot at the plane, shoot at the plane" - which I guess stunned them coming from an American...  But I was sad and mad, but not afraid.

But I also agree with Kate; that would eventually render the relationship a tad boring no?    Its nice to have a lot of things in common...but its even nicer when each one brings something new to the relationship; that way you could both evolve.....    Its funny...now that I think about it, I've always had 2best friends; 1 that was exactly like me...and the other 1, completely the opposite..and they would both balance me out/ bring out the best in me :)|`|XaVU965Jaa	I suppose so ... Id have to ask myself ...  just kidding ... yes, absolutely yes! A bit boring and hardheaded at times, but someone who would be there for me.|`|m1JxtSVSaa	no.. because i would like to know someone different than me|`|ie5AKYToaa	No, I think I talk too much and bore the life out of people :) looool    Actually, I like to think of myself as a good friend, but I really don't know how people see me. If you would want to be friends with me, then I think I'm good enough to be friends with myself, lol.|`|pcCUUJsnaa	LOL...I dunno...no one wants a friend exactly like them, it would be too boring...so I'd say NO  btw NICE QUESTIONS   :-D

Some things in London can be expensive but if you are buying tourist things be cafefull not to get ripped off. You can by a pint of beer for around 3 pound and a packet of crisps cost 50p so you should be fine with between 150-300!|`|TDp3H7i4aa	): I want to go to London.

Fnp2MIycaa	In this article, from the National Capital Authority, it says that the site had to be easily accessable by rail from both Sydney and Melbourne. That means it had to be inland.    The Siting and Naming of Canberra.    Both before and after Federation, there was much public bickering about what and where a federal territory and Seat of Government should be. The Constitution said that the Parliament must choose a site at least one hundred miles (160km) from Sydney and that the Parliament would sit in Melbourne until a new parliament house was built in the new capital.    More than 60 country centres in New South Wales were promoted as sites for the capital because of their bracing climate, the purity of their water supplies or an abundance of stone and timber for building. Towns along the main railway line from Sydney to Melbourne offered accessibility to both cities, but sites in the far south of the state around Albury were deemed to be too close to Melbourne. Sites in the north of the state, such as Armidale and Tamworth, were considered too far from Sydney and much too far from Melbourne.     In the winter of 1902, members of both Houses of Parliament left the comforts of Melbourne to inspect many of the nominated sites.     In October 1908, the Seat of Government Bill, confirming Yass-Canberra as the nations capital, was passed by the Parliament.    In 1913, when the Canberra area was no more than an outback sheep station divided by the Molonglo River, a ceremony was held to name the city. Canberra, as a new name for the capital, was a sentimental favourite and logical choice. The name probably derived from a local Aboriginal word for meeting place and had been in common use in the district for more than three-quarters of a century.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	At the time the location was selected, Melbourne was the largest city and New South Wales with its capital of Sydney was the most populous state. There was a lot of squabbling about which of the two cities would be the capital and it was eventually agreed that a new city would be built in a Commonwealth area somewhere between the two but more than 100 miles from Sydney. Given the relative locations of the two cities, and the size of the area required, an inland site was considered to be more practical.|`|8phHXAO7aa	:) I'm a born and bred Canberran...  Eden on the South coast was actually the preference for the Capital, however they decided against putting it on the coastline so that there was no risk of naval attacks.

OHfZFR31aa	Denmark is very strict on family reunification - that's why there are thousands of Danes with foreign partners who are living across the bridge in Sweden. But you will have the same problem in Sweden if you were illegally living in Europe. I can't imagine many countries letting you in if you had been illegal. Is there anyway your husband can move to Peru to be with you? Then after a few years, you can move back to Denmark as you will be able to prove you have been living together.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	I moved to Denmark under the reunification program, but I applied for it before my tourist visa expired.    If you lived here illegally, you've pretty much messed up BIG time.  The only thing I could recommend would be for you and your husband to appeal the decision and ask them to reconsider your case.  Otherwise you'll be left trying to find a country which will allow you to reside there.|`|99lX5uZfaa	Hi Tania,    I was also granted my visa via family reunification.    I don't know what to do in your case, but if I were you, I would ask a lawyer in Denmark who deals with that... Denmark is a country that in regards to immigration, seems to make their own laws and regulations (just recently EU said Denmark was acting illegally about some immigration procedures).    So, I really think you should seek legal help, especially because I am pretty sure your husband needs to be living in Denmark in order to apply for your visa - so, before making such decisions, legal help will be able to clarify things for you.    You can see on this page two sources I added about legal help and one of them is free.    http://www.foreignersindenmark.dk/displa...    Good luck!

pTLcvsVfaa	There is no set requirement. It will depend mainly on the agency that hires you.    I am a travel agent and started up about 7 years ago. My employer wanted me to take a night travel agent class at a local college. It was very easy and only lasted about 3 months. However these days most employers may want to you already be verified on sabre, or learn in on your own. This may mean having to shell out for another course.    At the same time, you will have to get trained on Sabre or whatever system your agency uses. Normally, someone from within the agency will teach you this. It takes about a month before you start getting comfortable, but the basics can be learned within a week or maybe less.     At some point your agency will put you on their IATA list and you will be an offical agent.     I have to agree that you want to be very careful about this business right now. Established agents can still make very good money. We have an agent in our office who make close to 1 million a year. And we have some that make hardly anything. Breaking into the business right now is not going to be easy.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	get out your phone book and start calling all the travel agencies and ask...it's probably different in every state.|`|ZGUkizjYaa	I'm not sure, but considering the state of travel agencies today, you may want to reconsider.    Today's travel agency is a lot different than it used to be.  40 years ago, everyone bought their plane tickets at an agency or at an airline ticket office.  When was the last time you did either?  There is no future in that role, so I advise you to change your mind.|`|23vKOyBraa	Study a certified travel agents course..|`|DTae8IGeaa	I'm not sure why you would WANT to be a "certified airline travel agent."    You do know that the airlines do not pay base commissions on airline tickets, right?    Also, it was unclear to me whether you want to OWN a travel agency or be an employee.    Typically, travel agencies hiring people to do airline tickets are looking for recent graduates of travel schools who have been trained in whichever GDS they use. So if you don't know which agency you'll be joining, it's sort of a crap shoot on picking GDS training.    Tip: Sabre has greater market share than any other GDS, so if you learn Sabre, you'll have the widest choice of possible employers.    Better, IMHO, is Iceman's excellent suggestion to find an agency that will either train you or pay you while you take courses.    But I have a bias against airline tickets. My expertise and experience is in the home-based travel agent sphere, where agents concentrate on selling high-ticket, high margin products. That's where the money is.    I'll bet that the agent making nearly $1 million that Iceman mentions didn't do it by selling airline tickets!    Something to think about.

Wm0mBDn1aa	Tourism, nowadays is one of the most popular way of spending free time. It is higly developed in almost all countries, mainly because of material profits it brings. But unfortunately, there is the other side of the coin too, especially if it comes about foreign tourism.  From educational point of view, travelling lets people to see world, other peoples, culture and traditions. It is said, that traveling broadens and most people consider, it does. At the same time, tourists who has not wide knowledge about World, can see the grass greener on the other side of the fence. It causes danger of discontent with country that person live in, what entail complaints and dissatisfaction.  Also economical aspect plays huge role in domestic market economy. Lot of people works in tourist branch what is often their only source of income. What is more, there are some countries - like Malta for example - where tourism is basis of all its revenue. Howewer, if all field are tourist-minded, prices are inflated what is huge drawback for natives.  Thirdly, tourism can have influence on tourist religious viewpoint. Seeing place which is some religion root, surely strengthens pilgrims faith. On the other hand, showing ones faith can meet with incomprehension or even contempt.  In my opinion, tourism is too important for my mental to be stoped, or even restricted because of mentioned below reasons. It should be still developing, and becoming easier to get for more and more people.|`|xGI9z01Maa	Depending on were you live, it might be for the work force.  I have lived in Hawaii and Alaska.  Most of the people that live in both areas get a lot of income from tourism.  The hotels get money from the tourist, the hotel pays the employees, the employees spend the money on rent, food, and everything else.  Therefore, the hotel is dependent on tourism to stay open, the local pizza place get a bit of that money from the employee who go to pizza on Friday night. Babysitter get money from the employees and spend it at the pizza place.  This is what makes the local economy for Hawaii and many Alaska towns.|`|AA12116854	Are you kidding? It supports both the local and national economies of cities, countries, continents. The local farmers, merchants, producers (jewelry, cars, clothing, etc.,) make their money from tourists who spend (hopefully) freely on souvenirs and other local products; and then the national/continental economies are supported via taxes on the those purchased souvenirs and products. Of course, it is much more complicated than that, but this is just a sketch of the concept.|`|SqE8dFGQaa	Tourism is a huge part of many countries' economies. Tourists spend in the countries they visit, therefore helping their economies, yet they don't take any money from the economy because they aren't citizens.

However it was never "required" to take two ferries.  You could go round by Kincardine or prior to that bridge, Stirling, and then on to Perth.  You'd then have had to make a slight detour of course to take in Fife but it was entirely possible.

I had to close my school cos every road has got heaps of snow on them and there's jack-knifed lorries and stuck cars in all directions. I've dug my car out - took me over 2 hours!  But we hope to be open tomorrow...

EjhJliKmaa	the price.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Because they can just select from appetizer to main dish and there's no hassle in preparing.

I keep telling you this, Location location location... MOST folks are not into formal dining since it's extremely expensive, and besides formal dining is not just for everybody there, unless there is an occasion. Yes there are fine formal dining restaurants but it's not just a Filipino mainstream thing to do =)|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	the price says it so...|`|Imqb5ueqaa	It is defined by the occasion, and the attendant dress code.    Thus, a buffet dinner at the Shang ri La Makati hosted by Forbes Park ladies in honor of some diplomat may be classified as a "formal" dinner. Occassions like these require formal wear.
Imqb5ueqaa	It is dinner because you can have candle light, which may be odd for breakfast or lunch.    The wife enjoys the dinner date for 3 reasons: she doesn't have to cook, she doesn't have to pay, and she is happy to be "paraded" by the husband - - this adds to her peace of mind that the husband is not hiding any secrets from her.    The husband enjoys the dinner date : he gets to eat better-cooked food (LOL), and is able to demonstrate to the wife that he is proud of her, enough to show her in a very public place, and that he is not hiding any secrets from her (so he brings her to an obscure place for dinner - LOL!)|`|KVlRYoidaa	they are already married so their no need to go those motels to have sex.|`|XojyuUfYaa	BECAUSE THEY LOVE              AND LOVE TO EAT LOL|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	The complacency of marriage.  Unlike when a couple is still dating, the excitement of going out has somehow diminish in fervor or intensity.  Dinner date is sometimes a routine for some couples, nothing really special except when they make an extra effort to make it super special and exciting.|`|H8bfXVChaa	Well personally i think this is just a limitation of imagination. there is so much other things that can be done.    First if you got kids you need to send them out for a while so u 2 can spend time together. Send them to a place where you know they will enjoy their time and you will not need to worry and have an ease of mind.    somethings you can try  Recreating the first date- remember the first time you guys met. A person with a good memory has no problems. :))    Renew wedding vows    Write each other love letters.  This will keep the fire burning. :)) You can do this by writing small things that you thought were sweet,cute moments to cherish and relive it. You can put these notes in heart shaped covers and stick it around the house, in the car, in a hand bag etc.    Plan a weekend  Go out some place, book a hotel well in advance and go there and spend your time with your loved one.    Having family fun  Get your children also and go for a picnic or help them make valentines day cards for their friends, teachers, mom, dad, grand parents... etc.|`|eZ2tQY53aa	I think it's the culture/lifestyle Fidel. IF you live in the metropolis then several couples are working during that day, so I think it's just the convenience and practicality. Im sure there are some other couples who choose to do something else, golf date or bowling, watch a movie, travel, skydive, scuba dive ..it depends on the couples' convenience, money, culture and tradition Fidel =)

Just a thought.|`|oqiw8Ruuaa	gambling is a game of chance.            what's with the uh-oh ladies anyway?

06cadd03487b295a4976db9f27d72074aa	Here is the best advice.  Ask this question to your favorite Pharmacist.    I used to go to the local clinic whenever I needed to see someone and then I would always take my scrips to Matt my pharmacist at CVS to have them filled. On more than one occasion I would have obvious symptoms("cold, allergy, flu") and Matt would take one look at me then at my scrips and shake his head mumbling to himself about "stupid doctors". So one visit I asked him to recommend a doctor that impressed him, he did and I haven't been happier or healthier since.    Hope this helps.      Pharmacists go through much of the same schooling as do general doctors and they also know what medication is the best for what ailment but they are not allowed to prescribe only recommend.|`|hjBANc65aa	I know an amazing doctor in Milwaukie, I will get her Address for her practice and put it up tommorow for you. :)

If you don't know the weight of the entire package (not just the item inside), then you should go to the Post Office and get it weighed to get the proper postage amount.

Munnar was the summer resort of British Government in South India. It is 1600 m (5400 ft) above sea level.  There are in  three rivers - Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru which flow through this town, but join some distance away from Munnar. Munnar in Malayalam and Tamil means three rivers.     The Neelakurinji, a blue flower which blooms only every twelve years, is found in this region. It bloomed last in December 2006. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India - Anamudi, 2695m. The tea plantations and holiday facilities make this a popular hill station.    The people of Munnar share in the culture and traditions of Kerala and Tamilnadu. Tamil immigrants have a major share of  population. During the British rule of India, Munnar was developed to cultivate tea plants. At that time, most of the people around the area were employed as laborers for the various plantations. In the early stages of development, only Tamilians and a few Malayalis inhabited Munnar.     Most of the top positions in the estates were occupied by the British "Managers". A few bungalows were built for them and these are still in use. Munnar was a Hill Station for some British who sought a cooler climate. The two educational institutes in Munnar are Govt. Arts & Science College and Govt. Engineering College. Hospitals in Munnar are Tata General Hospital, Matha Hospital and Arun Hospital.    The region in and around Munnar varies in height from 1,600 meters (5,249.3 ft) to 1,800 meters (5,905.5 ft) above mean sea level. Munnar enjoys a salubrious climate. The weather ranges between 0 C (32 F) and +10 C (50 F) in winter and +15 C (59 F) and +25 C (77 F) in summer. The tourist season is from August to May. However, even the monsoons are lovely with many streams and rivulets in the area.    The territory of Munnar is almost entirely occupied by 30) are owned by Tata Tea, one of the Tata Group of companies. The entire area is known as "high range" and rarely Kannan Devan Hills, from which the famous brand of the Tatas gets its name. In April 2005, the Tata Group decided to divest its holding in the Munnar tea plantations, after which the employees purchased the plantations and are now running the same as Kanan Devan Hills Plantations Company Private Limited.    Many residents are employed in the tourism business. In 2000, the Government of Kerala declared Munnar as a tourist spot. This has helped in attracting more tourists to this beautiful hill resort.

The action was stopped in midstream by American pressure.    Meanwhile, Hamas has been stealing medicine and food sent by international donors, distributing these supplies among its members and selling the rest for profit. This accusation, appearing in numerous eyewitness reports in Palestinian Authority newspapers since the end of the Gaza War, has now been corroborated by UNRWA.     Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida have been reporting that armed Hamas men have comandeered trucks delivering food to UNRWA and have shot at the truck drivers.    Hamas has also refused to allow charities to distribute any of the supplies. An article in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida describes how Hamas militias took control of two charity organizations in Jabaliya and in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, and made them sign an agreement not to distribute any aid or "carry out social or humanitarian actions."    The following are multiple reports of Hamas's continuing theft of donor aid.  "UNWRA reported yesterday that Hamas police confiscated supplies of humanitarian aid from one of the distribution points under its control in Gaza. Two days ago, they report, more than 3,500 blankets and 406 food parcels were confiscated by Hamas police officials."    [Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Feb. 5, 2009]    "Yesterday the Hamas militias took control of two charity organizations in Jabaliya and in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip. Sources said that the Hamas militias took control over the Association for the Disabled in Jabaliya, and  the "Our Home" association in Beit Lahiya. They forced the people in charge of the two [charity] organizations to sign that they obligate themselves not to distribute any aid or carry out social or humanitarian actions."

Hope this info helps, Enjoy the trip!|`|8a1c4efde714f3448706c28696452e2eaa	February through April is a great time to travel to Costa Rica if you want great weather. We send many students to learn Spanish in Costa rica through: http://spanishabroad.com/studyabroad.htm during the summer months as this is the time they have available. They still love it and there are less tourists so it is easier to practice your Spanish. Hotels are cheaper during this rainy season (May to November) if you are just going for tourism|`|yO2c9l2qaa	This months are OK to travel,because is summer there.Between  april 5 to april 12 is a holy week ,and all the hotels are full,and the price is expensive.Have a nice trip.
Wt398Yueaa	There is nothing undemocratic about saying that someone should or should not run in an election. If there is free speech, people must be allowed to hold and express such opinions.    Zuma has not been prevented from running and the people will vote for or against him as they see fit.    Or is there something I am missing here?|`|owZn2Y8Kaa	I would say yes  ...  everybody wants someone else as president, and they all have the right to vote  - in the end we must have one we are proud of and that we all can respect|`|G1hQZuaiaa	Maybe innocent, maybe not, but what the ANC is doing is trying to avoid a trial, and paying for the legal fees by using tax payer money. If this was you or me, we would have been to court a long time ago, and would have paid for our own lawyers. If he is innocent, why would he want to avoid a trial in the first place?|`|1AHxTBDUaa	For an innocent man he sure has gone to he helova lot of trouble to NOT have his day in court.   A TRULY innocent man would actually want to get it all over with ASAP.    Its not ILLEGAL for him to be a candidate for president - but is it right? That is an entirely different question!|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Democracy and fairness are not interchangeable concepts, do not equate them.  The judiciary is supposedly separate from the electorate and no amount of stomping feet will help that.      And by the way many people do not get the President they want because we don't all want the same thing.  All we can do is hope -or try to convince people - to want the same thing as most people to increase our chances of getting it.     Whether someone believes he should run or not is up to them.  Some people didn't think Mandela should have run because they wanted Chris Hani, but now they respect his legend and still hold the same grudge,  its called politics... Deal with it.|`|fYDX6Ugiaa	If the people want him as president, they should get what they want, and he should run. That is, assuming nothing changes, and he is not found guilty.|`|2hjMFEUyaa	I personally feel that the right thing to do, would have been to withdraw Zuma as the ANC's candidate until his name has been cleared. A person who has to deal with trails and hearings can not give all their attention to running a country effectively. If the ANC are intent on having him as their president they could have put him up for the presidency 4 years from now.    The only thing I find ironic about the whole situation is that if he was up for the presidency with charges hanging over his head in just about any other country I doubt that he'd get even 5% of the votes. I find it tragic that the majority of South Africans base their votes on popularity in stead of on fact and what would be better for this country.    The fact is that Zuma will in all probability become president, another fact is that he is currently suppose to stand trail for his crimes in August. Another fact is that based on the assumption that he will be SA's new president the ANC is already trying to get him out of his trails and hearings in August. The mere fact that they are trying to avoid the trail indicates to me that there might be incriminating evidence they would not like to surface, because let's face it - an innocent man has nothing to fear of a courtroom. Should they succeed in getting him exempted from the hearings, it would bring me to doubt our democracy and constitution as no one person should be above the law.|`|SwojYmvdaa	He may be innocent but the fact that he had sex with a girl who was HIV positive and then said he showered to make sure he wasn't infected would suggest that he has clouded judgement. The ANC should have withdrawn his candidacy for president because of this but for some reason people in South Africa want this guy to be president so badly becuase he is "supposedly" a man of the people. Had he been a man of the people he wouldn't have had Schabir Schaik paying his kids school fees and "donating" money huge sums of money to him|`|81sucrAEaa	it's impossible for everybody to get the president they want.... look at america some people hate obama some don't
3Rpwwuglaa	huh what?? the JPMD was in strike?  Thats news to me!  Youre right! When theres strikes in those profession you mention, we all know about. Now metro goes on strike and this is the first place i heard about it?!  hahaha!|`|G1hQZuaiaa	Didn't even make the papers (no headlines) where I am from. Not that the police do much in any case, I talked to this one guy who said they broke into his car the Saturday evening, and when he phoned the cops the Sunday they said he should wait till Monday because they don't take finger prints on Sundays. Not that they are ever going to catch the person who did it anyway. Like the ******* wild west in this country.
4kxg48quaa	It never snows on the M27. If there's heavy snow when it's not busy the M3 sometimes loses a lane in places, but it's fine so long as you drive carefully.    The best advice I can give is to run this before you go: http://www.traffic-england.co.uk/motorwa... (tick all the boxes)
AleT38EYaa	It's possible.  If jobs on the farms for immigrants continue to grow, and if the larger cities (Louisville and Lexington) can offer competitive jobs and raise their standards of living, it would definitely be a more attractive state in which to live.  I think Louisville has already done a great deal with their urban revitalization, and if they can attract bigger jobs, I think it's a possibility within the next century.|`|AA10527991	Anything's possible.|`|lo3T01BOaa	Kentucky with a population of over 10 million? Well yeah, I'm sure it will get there one day. I personally wouldn't want to live in Kentucky because it's not as "nice" as other states, but maybe it will improve one day.|`|cCdhHyF8aa	It depends on what the Commonwealth can offer people to get them to move there or stay there. If it can expand and offer jobs I'm sure people would move there. I lived there for almost three years and moved back to California, but that's me.
R2MsEyDOaa	I have no idea about the sponsorship thingy - does seem a tad silly though, doesn't it?  Yes I voted. For the Dinosaur Park in Alberta. Anyone who has ever been there will think it is a terrific spot and fits right in with the idea of Wonders of the World. I voted for Niagara simply because it is a pretty nice spot and it's Canadian and I have seen it.  It is a bit difficult to be totally fair - places I have seen have a personal connection, all the others a judgement is made strictly on the paragraph and picture attached. So I voted for places I have seen in Africa and Europe. Perhaps had I seen some of these other places, my vote would be different.    Interesting site though. Glad you asked about it.  :o)|`|rzVKdMXzaa	Niagara Falls, it's BEAUTIFUL!!! It is so spectacular when you go see it!
OHfZFR31aa	It depends for how long. Monaco is tiny so you can see it in a day. You can visit the royal palace, the casino, the aquarium, the gardens (jardins exotiques) then sit on the beach or eat some good food. But they do have good weather a lot of the year, and you can do day trips to places like Nice, Eze, Grasse and other places in the south of France|`|0yTM98Odaa	I think so, it looks nice there but I think if you want to see a lot then I wouldn't stay there for long, I would go there for a few days and then another country close by.|`|MRhpYS77aa	Go there on a day trip. It is very expensive and I imagine it could be quite boring unless you have a lot of money.
bnA0wUPRaa	I would stash them in backpacks and blankets just in case. I think the main thing is fruits. But you can always just buy the cereal in the US. Its going to be about the same price. I dont know about jams I would hide them just incase.|`|590e2069a84127a4b927f1c3359963bdaa	Yes. you can

Its spelt Kirkby and its not in Liverpool, its in the borough of Knowsley, you know like Man U isn't really in Manchester but Salford.    A sock burgler is what mancs call a washing line bandit.    Tell me what do they call it down south?
AA10087814	Manila is better.  Best shopping, nightlife and alot of history.|`|xThpp6e9aa	i think Honolulu is  more expensive and has warmer weather.  San Juan has better beaches but its pretty tough with the beaches i would recommend anywhere in Hawaii|`|aFUkzlLLaa	honolulu, hawaii    honolulu is much more expensive because you have to travel der.  it has the best beaches  and it has cool days and cool nights
9z5NASypaa	ahhhhhhhhhhhh good luck with that, comming from an Aucks inner city girl.  Actually Im sure there are heaps of different people out at MIT, you will make friends quick im sure. You will be ok. Just dont take your expensive labels out there with you.|`|o65klEwWaa	OMG, have you never left Howick in your life?     I really have trouble with your question and I am the most un-P.C. person you will ever meet.    I also come from the Eastern suburbs, reluctant to say which one, but suffice to say it is arguably the nicest. I also went to MIT years ago. The campus is large, you need never leave it if you are that worried, but  I am sure that before long you will be tottering around the Otara Mall (I think it is called), as happy as a pig in mud. (so to speak.)     The native-Otarians are quite used to students milling amongst them, in fact they quite possibly depend on the extra money spent in their shops. I found the shopping centre to be completely non-threatening despite the legendary machete attack. The only time I was hassled was by a couple of bible bashers.    Otara shopping centre is hardly in the centre of hard-a*s Otara anyway. It is just on the edge of the motorway near the boundary. And if you are so snobby you can't tread on their sullied soil, then you can turn right at the MIT gates wander across the motorway bridge and a short walk later you will be in Papatoetoe, which has a K-Mart and other excitements.|`|vXgF2fMoaa	You make Otara sound ghetto AZZZZZZZZZZZZZ    Its not like that.Just cause Otara is known for that sorta thing doesnt mean you will get jumped while at M.I.T,    Otara is safe,im not talking ****,it is,How do i know?because i was born and raised and i use to stay not far from M.I.T.You will just be another face added to the picture,    Bulletproof desk?hahahaha,SERIOUSLY?  Do you think they have bulletproof houses aswell?  Is someone gonna shoot you while reading a book in the library?    Just because you got jumped in Manukau shopping center,you labbelled Otara like that?they could of been from Pakuranga,Mangere,Manurewa OR mayb, mayb Howick?????????    Do you think everybody in Otara carries a gun?  No your facts before you talk about a place and nextime dont type ITS OTARA because its kinder disrespectfull to the ones that stays there.    BUT ANYWAYS....Otara is not dangerous and its an alright place,  Goodluck with your course|`|deEs2ta8aa	Don't worry about it... yeah it's Otara but it's MIT! Lots of people go there. I went to MIT once with a friend and it doesn't have bulletproof desks, it doesn't need them.    It's not the ghettos of Mexico! It's Otara, NEW ZEALAND. People don't have guns like you see on tv, and the people that do have them aren't going to be at MIT.     The majority of people there are women in their 30s redoing school. Trust me, it's perfectly fine.    But seriously you are like 18 and you don't know about Otara? You live in Howick, it's pretty close. You must have gone to Macleans or something and heard untrue rumours.|`|bWp0wMkraa	I've neva been to Otara but really it can't be as bad as you think i heard west auckland was scary but i went their once and it wasn't even scary.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Go to the markets on a Saturday morning and see the REAL Otara.    ANY place can seem like a hell-hole when the media continually portray it like that.
LDqzP2LVaa	No need to pre-order anything. You'll find plenti of taxis at the airport. They take 4 passengers (3 at the back and one at the front), just make sure that the trunk of the car will fit for a luggage of 4 people.|`|hMTL2AV7aa	you can get all the info from  http://www.dubaitaxi.ae|`|z2QYSFlvaa	if the taxi takes 3 or 4 passangers it's warranty for the journey to make more money, because the taxi driver will charge per trip to different locations|`|9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	Airport taxis are registered to differing licences from 3 - 6 passengers. As to pre ordering I cannot say other than I have never bothered.|`|xsP90gEbaa	Yes pick up at airport|`|3bc80c62eac090b136c41da84008bc69aa	4 max for a five seater|`|BV0cAa8Caa	am dubai local ..   1- there is no such a rule taxis can take 4.    2- no need to pre order  a transfer|`|e1amuRXSaa	1.they will take 4...  2. i don't know lol    EDIT: http://dtc.dubai.ae/en.portal?dtcservice...
qKdQpZ5Kaa	they have a stockpile of grit, which costs them money to store, and with scientific advisers telling us that global warming is causing milder winters I presume there has to be a common sense guess as to how large this store of grit should be.  In this winter we had a very long run of ice in December, followed by snow, so the demand for grit must have been high and they are running out of it.      I know journalists say it is bad planning, but they would say it was a mistake if the stockpile of grit was increased and we'd had continuing milder Winters.  It's a trade off between providing for every possible situation and the cost of doing that.|`|AA10310496	Well the roads have been gritted where I live but there has been so much snow come down on top of it that it makes the grit practically useless.  It's not feasible to have a gritter keep going up and down the same road all day long, which they would have to do to keep on top of the snow and to please some of the people on this board...    (not having a dig at you)
Vv7a31pmaa	Go to the website of any city you want to visit and work.  It will give you all the local paper Information and then the rest is simple.
sJ7GzZLbaa	I agree with the person above me, Mexico is not your best bet unless you go somewhere really nice like Cabo. Just stay in the US to be safe. It can be pretty dangerous and risky down there.     restaurants are good pretty much anywhere. Downtown has a ton of places you could be there for days and not eat at all of them. As for beaches I would go to Coronado. Probably the most well known and nicest. La Jolla and Del Mar are also nice. If you want to have a close beach and shopping to go Pacific Beach.    The only clubs available would be on thursday nights. Those are the only 18+ ones.     I have never been to that hotel or seen it but it seems nice    Have fun|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	SAY OUT OF MEXICO!!!  There is a drug war going on and no one is safe there. They find dozens of bodies on the streets every week. Kidnapping is a major source of income. Even the SD locals, who use to be safe in Esenada, are not going there anymore.
AA12158034	Planes, yes. Cruise, I don't think so. All the discussions about that were on planes rather than ships.|`|1LlhqADoaa	There must be a way to shanghai straightly.

Many years ago ,In order to leave to mainland, Mr.Lin yifu even hold a basket-ball to swim through taiwan strait at one night.,  ,This a a Joke :).|`|0NdBx2keaa	Why do you want to go to Shanghai?
esE0yImYaa	and maybe you could ask someone to get the marvel toys at divisoria!    Did you know that most of the toys at toy kingdom comes from Binondo? well some of those items you would see in SM are available in Divisoria.  just be extra careful when you go there.|`|59K6Dfazaa	Based on my observations, stores loer their prizes during the Christmas season up to January. You can find a Toy Kingdom store in almost every SM, so better wait for the 3-day sale of any SM near you. During that time, stores go on big discounts. Try your luck this coming summer, graduation season.|`|95c460c9bbd2609530690f8e73215021aa	abs-cbn had clips on toys  numerous ones produced in zambales.  or visit shoe mart in all branches|`|AA11828341	I observe their on sale every Payday.

c06dc4d1e227f35f0b67179987536394aa	Very nice hotel, right in the middle of downtown, close to all bars, (and a block east of Crescent street where it's lined with bars).

0QbAiQwhaa	I really reckon the campervan, its easy to get to alot of places in New zealand because its small but it is so much easier and cooler in a campervan, plus theres alot of rest areas and park ups for them and it probably will be cheaper than hostels and that. hope that helps :)
s65op1hGaa	Nope not at all me and my friends say it on the odd occasion.   It's just a word. I guess that's like asking if Americans get annoyed when we call 'friends', 'mates'.  It's really just different cultures, your friend shouldn't be so bothered.|`|AA11349530	yes it does annoy me     why use such a superlative for something that's usually rather ordinary ... what do you say when something is truly awesome, you've run out of words|`|AA10310496	It doesn't annoy me in the least when someone says awesome...unless they are saying it all the time.  The use of the word cool all the time can be quite irritating but that is just one of the "in" words that people use nowadays, rather like the use of the words "fab" and "groovy" which were used all the time many years ago!|`|AA10222010	Well, you know how awesomely crude and backward we here in the Colonies are |`|pYe3kkgNaa	a words a word. it doesn't bother me in the slightest, tell your friend to stop stressing =]|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	I quite like 'awesome'.   What annoys me is the over (mis) use of the word 'random' which is now creeping into more formal areas of speech.
JxriMNDGaa	Die billigen Hotels au?erhalb von Disneyland liegen so weit weg das du mit dem Auto fahren musst ( 15 min.). Wenn du zu Fu? gehst  wirst du wohl kaum billige Hotels finden.|`|mX27tszPaa	I'm not sure you'd have to check a travel website, but I can offer you a few important pieces of advice.  First, always book a hotel that looks nicer in the pictures than you want because if you book one that just looks ok in the pics it will probably be crappy when you get there.  And secondly, like someone else said, if you can book a hotel on disney property at least that will somewhat guarantee that your experience will be ok plus it will save you money over actual disney hotels but will still allow you some of the perks like shuttle and things that the disney hotels get without the price.  I put a link to an ehow article below that tells you how to get cheaper disney hotel packages, so I hope this info helps a bit.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4764797_discount...    Good luck, have fun, and be safe.|`|RrEESD6Paa	I would recommend checking out the website BookMe dot com. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money.

It isn't the nicest hotel in the world, but it is clean!  Plus, you get a good, free breakfast. It is also right across the street from the entrance to Disneyland.  After a long day of walking around, my feet were glad for the short walk there!      Be careful when looking on the internet for places that say they are right across from Disney.  Some are a mile or more away.  They are just trying to reel you in!
XaVU965Jaa	Yes, I can. In fact, it is sometimes a problem for me, having feelings about total strangers (not as in falling in love), like affinity or deep compassion for someone you just met ...  Thanks for these nice questions dear lady!|`|8b827ceddf32131352293b3496bb3ccdaa	Good day hayete. I know you are just waking up now :))    YES..I can have strong feelings for a stranger  What if not.........made us go across the whole planet to meet each others?????|`|xYTagSIyaa	People have feelings for people they don't know all the time.  I can remember one time I was with a very manly guy and I was driving and we got stopped by a school bus and two children got off the bus  in the country and started running to their door and the mom came to the door with a big smile, letting the dog out and the dog ran and greeted the children with wild excitement and the mom hugged and kissed the kids and my big macho man friend started wiping the tears from his eyes.  I was a wee bit choked up myself.    People often feel sorry for the homeless and oppressed.

dpKntiZoaa	I'm not clear if you are asking what this means, or asking for the data.    The mean monthly temperature is an 'average' for the month based on historical data. However, using a average for the total continent of Europe will not actually tell you anything, as the temperatures can and do vary to a large extent - e.g. the temperatures in Norway and those in Spain are very different.  Even temperatures within countries like France, Germany etc, can and are different.    Therefore I would advise you to narrow your question/search down to the countries you are interested in, and then even the cities so you can get a real idea.      Here is a nice site for which you can choose if you want to see the temperature in either Celsius or Farenheit.  http://www.weatherbase.com/index.php3?se...|`|684d937807da5838ecacca779e1a3a88aa	It all depends where you like to go or of which country you like to now it.

MJdUkar5aa	a) It depends on whether the current proposals are passed in the senate - all legislation has to be ratified by both houses of parliament  b) I understand it would be based on a last year's tax return.

EDIT:  Sorry, but more investigation reveals that it's possible that you may not get anything - it depends on your taxpayer status last financial year. The Prime Minister's media release gives more details of who is eligible and it seems that the bonus is based on whether you were a taxpayer in FY 2007-2008. If you paid tax in that Financial Year, you get the $950 bonus. There doesn't seem to be provision for people who started work after 1st July 2008.    EDIT  2:  Mel - Just saw your edit which you must have posted while I was off doing some more research. I can't see anything though that says it will be prorated. Everything I've found says that if you paid any tax, you get the whole $950|`|1Itiv0Pzaa	you don't pay tax, you don't get it.    I am appalled that the government is wasting billions of dollars on petty cash handouts that will do nothing for the economy.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	You're parents may recieve it for you as a school student if they qualify to Family Tax Benefit A.     If you're parents recieve it, I believe you do not. If you do it is based on your tax return for 2007-2008. As under 18s do not pay tax, you would of recieved any you did pay back. So you would not recieve anything.     The payment is basically any tax paid after your refund up to $950. So if you paid $1000 in tax and got a refund of $500 you can only get a max of $500.     For those earning over $30,000 it also looks at the medicare levy, but I would assume if you earnt over $30,000 you would of paid more then $950 in tax.    Not so Ozmaniac, it states it is only based on your 07-08 tax return. If you don't pay tax you don't get it - http://www.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs....    Oz - If you're under 18, YOU DON'T PAY TAX! Anything you do pay your get back as a tax refund. You can also only get back, the maximum you paid. I've explained this above, the link shows how they work it out. It is a MAXIMUM payment of $950.      Sorry I'm not having a go, just getting the point across =)|`|dUpVqoB6aa	Please don't take my word for it but technically as a student you should get it but I am not sure whether you or your parents would get it.|`|be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	high school students will get the bonus of $950-and since you obviously earn below $80,000 per year if you didn't get it for being a student you would for your income.

TL1Jkqunaa	You sound like a lovely target.  You just picked most of the areas the better class of thieves look for.  And exactly for the same reasons- touristy stuff that tends to bring in easily stolen and easily disposed electronics.    Buy cheap versions of the same things for short time use.  Do not leave them in your car.  Most tour companies will store and care for your stuff.  Leave what you can with them, or stored at your hotel.  SOme bus stations provide lockers.      On raft trips they usually can take and protect cameras on the trip.  They use well built rubbery bags built just for that purpose.    Nothing is save in a rented car.  All rentals here have special plates basically saying "Hey thief- Over Here!"  They also call to the traffic cops.      ENjoy yourselves by doing without, by doing with but cheaply, or paying for storage some place.  Keep everything within reach and within sight.|`|JcZIjpU4aa	Well it depends on where you go and where you leave the car, you obviously want to take the camera with you or else whats the point of even bringing it. So what i would advice is when parking the car you try to either leave it on a public place with people walking around, or also there are guys who are just sitting there and you can pay something like $1 and they will watch your car and make sure nothing happens. When leaving the car in the street hide your camera or whatever you are carrying hidden under the seat or somewhere where its not visible from the outside. If you are doing all those activities with a tour you can ask the tour guide if he can hold on to the things till you are done with the trip, or if there is a counter where to leave them you can also leave them there, that a safe option too.  Cars from rentals DO NOT have a different license plate like someone said before, so don't worry about that. Honestly i think you will be fine, i have lived here since i was born and really nothing has happened, no one has tried to steal anything from my car.   What i would advice is that things such as passports or other important documents, you should leave them in the hotels security box and carry copies with you.   Other than that just enjoy the trip, im sure nothing will happen. Costa Rica is a safe country if you do things right.|`|Fa3uNqwMaa	Hi Guys! Im Glad you are coming to my country...

Jm3vMKx3aa	To tell you the truth, the German weather in April is unpredictable. We have a proverb in Germany which is: the weather of April has its own will.  Well, I have been working for USAREUR more than 15 years as local national employee and have been often on TDY to HTA.  I have experienced 8 inches of overnight snow on Easter but as well temperatures of 25 C (77 F) at noon in another year.  In general you should expect spring weather with temperatures about 10-15 C (50-59 F) during the day and lots of rainy and cloudy days, but in the last years we also had early summers or late winters.

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola!  Hi hon.  I live here in Cabo and can help you.  It is really expensive here...we are the most expensive resort in all of mexico.  If money is really really a concern you can go to Vallarta or Mazatlan for way cheaper.      To be honest with you ALL mexican resort towns on the pacific side are identical.  We have the same ocean, same resorts, same shopping, same nightclubs, same beach activities.  You really aren't missing anything by picking one over the other.   Cabo is currently popular because it has become the new spring break destination, and its where all the celebrities jet down for the weekend, because its only 2 hours away from LA.       I personally love Cabo for the pacific side, only because I've been coming here for over 30 years.   If money is really your concern, then rework your holiday. The siesta suites is okay if you just want to party and pass out, but wouldn't you rather stay at a really nice resort (5 star) for the same price???    Just being honest!|`|AnQrnzxeaa	There are many other places where you can go, and it will be cheaper for sure. Maybe if you can find a charter all inclusive to places like Mazatlan, Acapulco, Manzanillo, Ixtapa, etc.    The flights are very expensive when flying Mexico-USA. Sometimes it's more expensive to fly Houston - Mexico City than to fly Houston - London (just to give you an example).Check the following page to find the best airfares and hotels.    www.kayak.com
pcHp7Dgkaa	You can legally move out at 16.    You can get Youth Allowance from 16 if you're in full time training or if you are looking for work and not a cent otherwise.  http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/in...    Now tell me why taxpayers should help support you if you only want to move out "because of different lifestyle issues". In life, we all have to do things we're not 100% happy with, but mature people know that they can't expect other people to support their whims.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	The legal age is 16. Good to hear you have a job and are willing to pay your way, I hope you aren't going to drop out of school just so you can move. While it would be better not to need centrelink, your education is still important.     I believe your parents are expected to support you until you're 21, so perhaps they would be happy to contribute a little towards your rent or pay for your schooling, etc.     I would hope you would only move out if your parents approve and not against their wishes. It is still important to keep them in your life, you never know when you may need to move back home.|`|htBHCNDtaa	I believe it's 16. I think you can move out at 15 only if you live in an abusive family and can prove you're being neglected and are better off living alone. I suggest you just save up for 1 year and then move out.    Good luck.|`|23vKOyBraa	If you are still getting along with your parents, don't destroy that - get them on side to help/assist/permit you to move out. IF you just run away they can get legal assistance to drag you screaming back home.

If you want to move out, fine, but at least make sure you have a well paying job so you don't have to leach of the people's money through centrelink. I hate you people.

I don't think I'd trust it. I also looked up some info on the web and the site I looked at says that Human Trafficking is Dubai's worst nightmare, one of the biggest crimes in the Gulf.    Also checked out another site, that lists some main questions to ask someone to determine if they are a victim of human trafficking, and some included are :    - Can you leave your job if you want to? (Which you have indicated that you have to stay there for two years with no return)    - Has your identification or documentation been taken from you? (You said that they want your passport)    Judging from this information, I would NOT do it!!!! Find a waitressing job somewhere else!    However,  If you do decide to do it, be very careful! But from what you've said, I wouldn't do it... Sounds like a lot of weird stuff that you would have to go through just for a "Waitress" job (if that's what it is)|`|TG2LrbJSaa	I am not a heavy traveler but rule of thumb in the USA is NEVER give your passport to anyone.....I would be leary of such a request.

Call your consulate in Dubai and see what they advise.|`|bc6e45a0c84a380c304815c62b269325aa	Do your research!  Contact your country's embassy in Dubai and ask about this hotel's legitimacy and you can ask about the passport issue. Go on the internet and search about it. Find out where this hotel is located.    Typically the taking of passports or identification information is a big red flag for trafficking.

MURSaNQRaa	Assuming you are a US citizen and have a valid US Passport, the chance you take of your warrant appearing in the ICE data base varies by several factors:   how long has it been in the system for it to show up inter-agency-wise, for example.  Usually, for US citizens crossing the border on foot it should be pretty stress-free and easy if you have a passport.  If not, if you are of hispanic descent, if they suspect you are hiding something, or merely if they feel like it, the border agents can be real nit-pickers.      I would suggest you check with your lawyer to see if maybe you could get a something official declaring a humanitarian need for you to cross just in case.      As you say, you have crossed before and nothing much has happened so chances are this time would be no different but you are taking a chance.

XSBsomfVaa	The best advice I can give you is to act like it doesn't bother you. People tease other people because they are insecure about themselves and they want a reaction out of you.

That should fix the problem, they might start calling you gay, then tell them 'that you understand they are confused of their own sexualities but would prefer if they did not hit on you'.|`|C3p0MazWaa	if there in the same grade as you hit him or scare him some how.  and if he's not in your grade and you really want him to stop tell that girl.|`|wFCwfo0qaa	If it is his blonde friend just tell him that he is only saying it to you because he is the one that like his orangutan nipples. Or you could just tell him to quit because he has started to annoy you. I had a somewhat the same problem at the beginning of the school year and I was at a football game and some kid just kept on saying stuff to me and then he started slapping me. I had then punched him in the jaw but not hard and i started swearing and walked away. He had tried asking me if we were cool, but i was like no mann, not until you stop becoming immature.  So you should just tell him its getting really old and its becoming annoying and immature.|`|ydpVIpsHaa	Just smile/smirk/laugh at the person who teases you and walk away. That should get him irritated enough to realize it isn't going according to how he wants it to be.    I think by ignoring, the guy might think you're too weak and con't to tease you.    All the best, hope it gets better (:

SMiklS8vaa	At the risk of being blunt (but this is not a problem as I remember you being particularly rude to people trying to help you in the past), then of course they will not hire non-nationals that don't even speak Dutch.    They are not going to re-write all the procedures, documents and ask people (general public and other members of staff) to speak English just for you.    Ask yourself, - would any of the police forces in the US hire someone that does not speak English fluently? (Yes I know Spanish is sometimes an advantage and also a 'first' language, but fluent English is required).    The same applies in the Netherlands.  So the answer is no, they will not hire without Dutch being spoken fluently.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Normally - no.

If you do have special skills like specific knowledge of fighting criminal organisations in Europe, you might have a chance. I suspect you are not, because you would already know your value.

Br3hJfDCaa	Not so long ago, I did a tour of the Government house (near the botanical gardens) and learnt some interesting facts.  Before 1846, the Governor lived in the old government house (parramatta), until they built the Government  house in the city.  The Governor's of NSW officially resided there until 1996, and it still remains in use for official functions.

Munnar was the summer resort of British Government in South India. It is 1600 m (5400 ft) above sea level. There are in three rivers - Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru which flow through this town, but join some distance away from Munnar. Munnar in Malayalam and Tamil means three rivers.     The Neelakurinji, a blue flower which blooms only every twelve years, is found in this region. It bloomed last in December 2006. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India - Anamudi, 2695m. The tea plantations and holiday facilities make this a popular hill station.    The people of Munnar share in the culture and traditions of Kerala and Tamilnadu. Tamil immigrants have a major share of population. During the British rule of India, Munnar was developed to cultivate tea plants. At that time, most of the people around the area were employed as laborers for the various plantations. In the early stages of development, only Tamilians and a few Malayalis inhabited Munnar.     Most of the top positions in the estates were occupied by the British "Managers". A few bungalows were built for them and these are still in use. Munnar was a Hill Station for some British who sought a cooler climate. The two educational institutes in Munnar are Govt. Arts & Science College and Govt. Engineering College. Hospitals in Munnar are Tata General Hospital, Matha Hospital and Arun Hospital.    The region in and around Munnar varies in height from 1,600 meters (5,249.3 ft) to 1,800 meters (5,905.5 ft) above mean sea level. Munnar enjoys a salubrious climate. The weather ranges between 0 C (32 F) and +10 C (50 F) in winter and +15 C (59 F) and +25 C (77 F) in summer. The tourist season is from August to May. However, even the monsoons are lovely with many streams and rivulets in the area.    The territory of Munnar is almost entirely occupied by 30) are owned by Tata Tea, one of the Tata Group of companies. The entire area is known as "high range" and rarely Kannan Devan Hills, from which the famous brand of the Tatas gets its name. In April 2005, the Tata Group decided to divest its holding in the Munnar tea plantations, after which the employees purchased the plantations and are now running the same as Kanan Devan Hills Plantations Company Private Limited.    Many residents are employed in the tourism business. In 2000, the Government of Kerala declared Munnar as a tourist spot. This has helped in attracting more tourists to this beautiful hill resort. Several protected wildlife areas in the area attract many tourists who support the many hotels, restaurants and transport businesses in Munnar.

I will have made up my mind as soon as I see how you are dressed and how clean your car is. If you don't look like a church deacon and if your car isn't as clean as a hospital room, polish those walking shoes.    I don't care if you drive a hooptie, but it better be spotless. Vacuumed, and toothbrush clean. Glove-box organized. Trunk too. A sloppy car is a sloppy driver. I don't pass sloppy drivers because sloppy drivers kill people.     Sagging? Your feet be dragging. Shoes polished. Hair, one color, clean and combed. Sit up straight. Adjust the seat and mirrors before putting on your seat-belt. Turn the radio off.    Remember I don't care if you have a prom next Saturday, I don't care if you have to drive your crippled grandmother to church on Sunday. My job is to keep you off the street.    Just get me a reason. ... oh yeah, and cry or threaten me when you fail. That gets you an extra black mark the next time you take the test.|`|NdnCh26Vaa	Southfield, in a neighborhood near 12 and Southfield rd.  I flunked my first test ( maybe bill was my test giver ).

But really, you'd be better off taking a taxi - there are usually some waiting near the Cohiba. Probably about CUC 5-10 into town.    It is certainly not recommended trying to catch Cuban busses in the city centre. Some foreigners have reported using the MN taxis, but I think that is against their rules.

dpKntiZoaa	Total and utter scam!    It is a site designed to draw in people who are looking to work in Europe, then offer them wonderful jobs, and it all looks great.... until they ask the person to pay money for some reason (e.g. agency fees, visa fees, legal fees etc).    They will ask you to pay via Western Union or Moneygram (which are the scammer's best friends as there is no recourse with this method).  You pay (assuming you will get this wonderful job) and once they have obtained all the money they can, then you can kiss your money and the job goodbye as it didn't exisit in the first place    This is called "Advanced Fee Fraud" and you can google it to see how common it is.  'jobineurope' is a well known scam site  http://www.consumercomplaints.in/complai...  http://www.fraudwatchers.org/forums/show...  http://balitangofw.blogspot.com/2008/10/...

Considering how expensive and time consuming it is for any company to sponsor a non EU citizen for a work permit, they wouldn't bother unless they were able to interview you in person and verify the information on your CV is correct.     And don't EVER pay money to anyone offering you a job. If a company did want to sponsor you, they would cover your visa fees and all other expenses.

LCAzlHhEaa	I would recommend the island of Oahu, drive away from Honolulu which is like any other large city and you can see beautiful Hawaii.  Oahu is the most touristy island so there is alot to do there such as Pearl Harbor, Iolani Palace, Polynesian Cultural Center, Dole Pineapple Plantation, North Shore, sunset dinner cruise, etc.    A great website to check out is www.gohawaii.com    Have a great trip!|`|BA3mGlTyaa	Coming to Hawaii and which island you come to is a hard decision.  Oahu is the most populated island with the majority of tourism/hotels/cars....  The other islands, Maui, Kauai, Big Island, Molokai are less developed but still has some nice resorts but would put you over the $300 day mark for the "to stay someplace nice".  There are plenty of local rentals on all the islands but would depend on what you call nice.    So, if this is your first visit to Hawaii I recommend (right or wrong, just an opinion) to stay on Oahu, South Shore to find the nice affordable place under $300 a day and close to swimmable beaches and surfing.  Then take a quick day trip to another island to get the feel between the islands.  This will give you endless experience on what you would like to do in the future when you come back to visit us again.    Hope this helps,    Just another local,    www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oahu.co...
u0udwkZQaa	You have two choices. You can either keep pestering different departments within BA hoping one person will slip up and give you a name or email address, or you can hire someone to find out which can be pricey and very illegal. Try getting the email address, if he made the booking online they'll have it, make up some story about him finding something you lost but you have no way of contacting him. Some story like you left your umbrella under his seat by mistake and you can identify him but never exchanged names. The proof will be that you can give your name and seat number, flight details etc, and verify the fact it was a man in the specific seat number next to you who picked up your belonging. Say the information desk called for you on the speaker but by the time you got to the counter he had gone, he had left the umbrella, but you wanted to thank him because it had sentimental value for whatever reason. Just an example. You've got to lie. If you just call up with a romantic story they'll all shoot you down about company policy and the law. Good luck!

You do this by advertising in places where you think he might see it. Even on your post here, you did not specify the date and flight.

The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is gearing to introduce mini buses in some parts of the State including the twin cities on an experimental basis as part of efforts to offset losses due to the stiff competition from seven-seater auto rickshaws.     Modalities to this effect had been worked out and the RTC management proposes to introduce 10 mini-buses, with 40-seat capacity, each in the twin cities, West and East Godavari districts, Warangal, Karimnagar, Mahabubnagar and Anantapur districts. A proposal to this effect was approved by the RTC management at a board meeting held yesterday wherein it was decided to hire 80 mini buses instead of purchasing them.     According to the outgoing RTC vice-chairman and managing director, R.P Singh, who is posted as the City Police Commissioner, the RTC Board had decided to invite tenders from interested parties and after receiving the bids, the parties who quote the lowest price per kilometre would be given the contract.     Though a study conducted by the RTC revealed that the initiative might not be successful, the corporation as a commercial body had to take the risk.     The Maharashtra Government too is going ahead with the introduction of 1,000 mini buses on all its major routes shortly, while Karnataka is also following suit.     The RTC is also contemplating introduction of two air-conditioned buses in the twin cities on an experimental basis.     "We will have to see the response from the car and other vehicle owners and if the response is good, the number of buses can be increased," he said.     Asked about his experience in the corporation, he said there was an immediate need for a change in the policies like taxation to make the organisation generate profits.     The Motor Vehicle tax on RTC buses, for instance, was higher than the tax paid by the owners of other vehicles. "Why should a car owner pay less than the poor bus passenger," he asked.|`|9lZdDU2Vaa	For your kind information 40 seat er are          not mini bus.Now regular luxury buses        will be 35 seaters|`|55f866f485af02e2201f99be99bc0ed9aa	tata 709 , asok leyland linex if u want to purs chasis or make body as u favroite

BJIo6twUaa	Polynesian cultural center all day, at night you get a dinner and show. The show is really good its called Horizons, if you are not sure you make it back to Hawaii for some reason on vacation or anything, i wouldnt miss Horizons.  http://www.polynesia.com/    If you like hiking, look up hiking on Oahu, lots of places to go hiking.    Check out the beach of north shore.  Beach is nice at Bellows, but only the marine part is open to the public on weekends (not sure if that have changed).    Of course there is Waikiki. I used to just park somewhere and go walking down the beach in the evening.    Hanauma Bay if you like to snorkel and check out the reefs. gotta watch out there, when it gets crowded, people swim over you, happen to my friends and I.    If you like clubbing, a few clubs i went to was Irish Rose and theres one across the road of it but i dont remember the name. There are a few other i been to but its been about 4 years since i have left hawaii.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	tons of hookers and tons of drugs,   you can find them anywhere, but youll have to pay more.   thats what typical business men like yourselves like away from home.  welcome aloha!!!|`|BA3mGlTyaa	The first thing that you must do is get on Hawaiian Time.  You will hear this expression on more then one occasion and basically it is just slow down and relax.  Not everybody and everything has to be on a neck break speed to get done.  What to do after that, with five weeks, you can pace yourself so you don't have to play the tourist but take your time and take your time again and then revisit the places you have enjoyed the most.  We see too many people trying to rush from place to place trying to get the check in the box.    Now just start off by jumping into your car and driving around the island.  Everybody knows the the basic routes to get to the South Shore, North Shore, East Shore.  Once you get comfortable on where you are at and getting around; then start branching out on what you want to do either surfing, snorkeling, hiking, kayaking ....      Just ask anyone and they will point you in the right direction.  You will see the Aloha Spirit is not just on the South Shore trying to get your money but everywhere on the island when you ask a friendly question.    Just another local,    www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oahu.co...    A rough start on the must-knows on the island but we are working on it.....

3K1QW7Oeaa	Why?? What's there in CALIFORNIA (we do not call it Cali!!) that would make you want to live there!?    It's expensive, it gets boring after a while, and it's just like everywhere else! The only difference is that it's in a state called California! Otherwise, California is just like North Carolina or Florida or Texas, etc. I would know because I have lived in California since I was born.    There's lot of crime? That depends on the city.    Where did you get the idea that California is this "glamorous place" with "palm trees"!?    If you got your information of CALIFORNIA from the television, then BOY, you will SOOOO BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!    It's not everyone's dream to live in California. For FOUR STRAIGHT YEARS!!!!!!!!! more people have been LEAVING California than coming in! My dream is to leave California and move to North Carolina!    Here's some helpful information for California:    As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in California is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City (soon to be), it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.    You will also need about $10,000 to start off.    Decent prices start at $800-1300 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $350 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.    Bottom Line: Look elsewhere, in 3 months you will probably be back in your hometown with no improvement whatsoever.|`|KVlRYoidaa	new york is a better place.|`|6pjmQ4d7aa	Not everyone wants to move to cali    I'd rather be in FL|`|3niZfJslaa	its like any other place|`|W0hNoMSsaa	It all depends on where you live in California. It's a very large and diverse state. Some places are very safe and others have crime problems. If you live in a small town or suburb, it's no different than anyplace else.    Unemployment is high here and housing isn't cheap, so it's best to line up a job  before you come.     And in conclusion, I'd like to say "Keep California green and gold. Bring money!" LOL|`|dhMUEYP9aa	Yes its safe, Santa Monica is nice and priced reasonably, Lots of palm trees and on the ocean.
AA10240904	The forecast is for cooler weather.  it was 69 yesterday but back to "normal" tomorrow which is 50's and wind.  Possibility of rain is small.  Since she is in business meetings, she probably won't go outside except at night when the temp drops in the desert|`|mAV5MJQnaa	You can check on the local forecast, sometimes on certain newspapers have there own forecast section.

I would pack slacks and three quarter lenght sleeves or long sleeves, depending on how hot or cold tempered she is.
2jQJipaaaa	Great question! I will try not to get to winded in my explanation.     As an American of NY Italian descent I grew up eating pizza with my hands. In fact it is the ethnically correct way to eat a slice of pizza that is thin crusted and crispy, cooked in real pizza oven. Real pizza needs no frills.      Eating pizza with a fork and knife is a crime!|`|9R8uYHcPaa	hands ... crust side first :)|`|m1JxtSVSaa	i use fork and knife..|`|hiKtjrWNaa	i heard somewhere that European eat pizza with their hands,cause they see it as bread, so no one eats bread with a fork or knife !!      well.. maybe i'm wrong :)|`|pcCUUJsnaa	it was a question from GHANNOUGE   I do like you do, take a slice with my hands fold it and eat it...no fork and no knife|`|FDjn05cNaa	I only ever use my hands....after all , it's PIZZA !   It's all about  having no washing up at the end !|`|7rdwArEMaa	HANDS|`|79nC5n4Daa	Best way is to use ur hands|`|LwqM7EHVaa	Use fork and knife to eat the first slice, because it's always hot.. then use your hands.. that's what I do..|`|XaVU965Jaa	I hate eating pizza with fork and knife and I do not care if people are staring at me! I use the fork and    Here in our city people like it with mayonnaise and catchup too (I dont) so our daughter likes to eat pizza when she visits here because in the city she lives (Sao Paulo) where there is more of an Italian tradition, they wont give you that to put on the pizza and look at you like you are an ET if you  ask for it ...|`|AA10956234	First, by eating with your hand it's much much yummy,     But for me it depends to eat with hand or fork & knife,     If I'm home then for sure my hands,   If I'm with friends then Hands,   If I'm with people I don't know well or in a 5* Restaurant , then knife and fork,     But no one can tell you that eating with fork and knife tastes better than with ur hands :)

jiOohUa0aa	It's not compulsory, and not all Singaporean know Mandarin and Malay, but each race knows how to communicate in English and their own mother tongue language (native language). Like I'm a Chinese, and I know English and Mandarin.|`|XXm2yCHiaa	Nope.  Malay is not a compulsary subject and knowledge of Mandarin and Malay is not compusary for ALL Singaporeans.      Imagine if ONE fella from India become a singaporean, then he would not know mandarin or malay right?  then your statement instantly becomes wrong coz not ALL know mandarin and malay.  aiyo...  can don't make such sweeping statements or not...|`|wfBwgAMQaa	Malay is not a compulsory subject in Singapore. Most of the Singaporeans of Chinese origin can speak Mandarin, but almost all Singaporeans of Malay origin can speak Malay.|`|8Xu0A70Saa	Malay Language is an optional subject. The main medium of instruction is English Language. The chinese or malay student can take up additional language course of their choice.    Majority of the pre-independent older generations of chinese Singaporean knows Malay and Mandarin.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	No, Malay language is not a compulsory subject for all students but only the for the Malays. No, not all Singaporean knows Mandarin and malay as Mandarin is mainly for Chinese and Malay is for the malays, although the national anthem is in Malay. There are quite a handful of Malays in Singapore do speak and understand and even write Chinese anyway, so do those Chinese who knows Malay in certain extend.|`|PDotv2Hsaa	The short answer is no.    In Singapore, all students learn English as their first language, and they have to take a second language.     Generally, if you're Chinese, you'll take Mandarin as your second language. If you're Malay, you'll study the Malay language. If you're Indian, then you've a choice of Tamil, Hindi, Punjabi and a host of other languages.    Since Singapore is a multi racial society, there are common phrases that cross over to each other's languages.|`|LBa98hVcaa	Unfortunately, no...although the national anthem is in Malay - Majulah Singapura and the National Language is Malay    But British English is a compulsory subject in schools today. Singaporeans are still being colonialised mentally - despite its independence. Just look at the Sir Stamford Raffles statue...also those places named after that Raffles guy (e.g. Raffles Junior College, Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls Secondary, Raffles Place MRT, Raffles City....)    So today's youngsters know English and their Mother Tongue. But i have read some Peranakans still taking Malay as a subject in school although they are of Chinese descent.     The older folks know Malay - anyway, there used be Malay schools - which have already been demolished.|`|yFo1GR3gaa	English is a compulsory subject.   Mother tongue or a second language is also a compulsory subject.  A third language is an optional subject, eg French, Japanese, etc.      A student's mother tongue depends of the race of the student,  eg. If the student is Chinese he/she would take Mandarin.   If the student is Malay he would take malay.   And in some cases, the student doesn't take he's own mother tongue, but a more popular language,   eg. If the student is indian, he takes malay as its more spoken.      No every one in singapore can speak malay, but all malays can, I can be sure of that. 30% of Singapore's population is malay, its not hard to find one around.|`|5c873097b4af9f2a2cc6aeb0288d4ff5aa	they do not even have enough teachers to teach that subject  so is selected basic in who get in the class  lately the PAP r trying to improve the subject in school  that is after i think they found out the volunteers they sending  to Indonesia during TSUNAMI relies could not talk with the local  LOL
jJxUCkkFaa	Ethiopian Jews are Jews!!!!!!!!!!!The great founding story of the Ethiopian nation is a tale of romance between the Queen the Sheba and King Solomon. Yes there are strong ties of blood between Ethiopia and the nations of the Middle East. Even the Ethiopian Church is noted for its strong ties to Judaism.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Yes, they are semetic.  Looks don't tell the story.  Who knows how they looked 3000 years ago.  By living in their climate and eating the local food for countless generations, they have evolved to look like Africans.|`|CH62r7qXaa	Let me rephrase your question, because Jews are a nation, not a race.  The bulk of our people are direct descendants of Jacob, but converts also become fully fledged members of the Jewish nation.    So I understand your question to be: Are Ethiopian Jews considered to be direct descendants of Jacob?    Well, they certainly think so; they claim descent from the Tribe of Dan.      So why are their skins darker than other Jews?  Because when you've been living in a certain place, you start taking on the physical characteristics of the local people after a few generations.  Jews who lived in Europe are typically paler than their cousins who come from Arab countries.  Jews from India and China look like native Indians and Chinese.      You could ask the same question about all people - since we're all descended from Adam, why do people in different countries look so different?  It's just the way Nature works; your body adapts to local conditions by developing the characteristics that best suit those conditions.|`|2MP9nYLdaa	Jews are Jews only by religion they live under the law gee I am glad I don't I would be doomed already now if I had to live under law|`|MjGgICRiaa	Wrong, Jews and being Jewish are 2 different thing. To be a Jew means you are descended from Jacob, to be Jewish you are a believer in Judaism.    http://www.cryptojews.com/Comparing_DNA....    Thank you. This proves Jews have their own DNA.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	Ethiopian Jews genetically are closer to Ethiopians than Israelis, but they are Semitic........why? Ethiopian language is a Semitic language. Oddly enough genetically they are 40% Greek and Mediterranean. This is not a surprise if you read about Greek and Egyptian cultural ties.|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	I can't answer your question except I make the following correction:  There is no such thing as "Jewish blood."  Under a microscope, Jews have the same types of blood other people do.|`|hWgWisC1aa	http://europesworld.info/|`|Ka1et1Doaa	nooo, some ethiopians are jewish some are chirstian and some are muslims. they dont have to look a certain way to have a certain religion.    the ones in isreal are there because isreal came to ethiopia and took them in a plane to isreal, they are the ones that were in the country, they are native to ethiopia. semetic is not a race nor a religion. and what is jewish blood? are you asking if they are part israli?    ethiopian jews are obviously not israli they are ethiopian. they are not native to the same land. ethiopian jews are from ethiopia israli jews are form isreal. isrealites took the ethiopian jews to isreal(they practicly stole them) at about 1991 or so

V6jFIm9faa	There are Muslims in Latin America, but they are not as visible as their European counterparts. The reason there is tension in Europe is because of certain extreme fundamentalists among the Muslim population, even though they are just a tiny portion, who want to spread the word of Islam and strike fear on the native Christian population.     Those on Latin America are pretty much docile moderates, even if there is tension, its not enough to gain regional or international attention.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Muslims causing trouble and tension in Europe? It's more likely to be the security forces targetting people who don't look European.  Hindu Indians for example - they look like Muslims - whatever that means.  There are certainly Muslims in 'Latin America'.  We already had a case when a Christian South American was unlawfully killed by the Metropolitan Police in London.  Muslim activists in Europe are really in the minority. Once people in Europe understand this, and stop putting all Muslims into one pot, then there might be hope for discussion and appeasement.  Questions like this just serve to inflame the unconsidered, ignorant prejudice against Muslims in Europe and force some disenchanted into the path of extremism.|`|VSC4PJX3aa	I'm from Brazil and here the Muslim shake hands with the jews. No problem at all. We have big numbers of Lebanese, Syrian, etc....They love Brazil, we're not worried, they usually change their culture to look more like brazilian, no burka and stuff, and we don't talk about religion in our day life, but we r one of the greatest Christian countries of the world.

YGSstaiEaa	She was popular about nearly 40 yrs ago.  Her signature movies are:  seriese which I really don't know the detail stories.  701 1972(Joshuu 701 gou Sasori)    411972(Joshuu Sasori dai 41 zakkyobou)   1973(Joshuu Sasori kemono beya)   7011973(Joshuu sasori 701gou urami bushi)  It's about a woman who was cheated on by her bf, and ended up in jail. While Sasori (nickname) was in jail, she got many harrassment and sexual abuse by other prisonors and correction officers.  She underwent those things, and finally took revenged people who hurt her mentally or physically. I think it's R rated movie seriese.  "Sasori" is her nickname in the movie.     1973(Jingi naki tatakai/ Hiroshima shitou hen)  It's completely yakuza movie, directed by Kinji Fukasaku.

ed7f41563760c6fcda66c83850dfad25aa	Hi,    It's me again (thanks for choosing my answer before).    Well, I misread the movie title before that it's actually called " Gokudo No Onna-tachi," not "Gokudo No Tsuma Tachi."  Since the Chinese character of " Onna" is "Tsuma(" which means " wife", I misread the title.    Anyway, its English title is  " Wives of the Yakuza " or " The Yakuza Wives."    http://www.brns.com/japan/pages1/japan25...    http://www.kurotokagi.com/yakuza_nz.htm    http://www.kurotokagi.com/|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Check some of the lists below.

Israelis are tough on the outside but soft on the inside. They are tough and they dont take crap. They tell you things as they see them and they dont waste time suger coating it.     In a way its kind of refreshing, with israelis you always know where you stand, they mean what they say and even though they can make doing the simplist of things look like a full blow riot sometimes they are the most genuine and honest people I have ever met and they stick together ...     Jews all over are kind of like that too... im always joking about jewish kids in shul having no manners and telling me straight when they dont like what im wearing ( one girl of about 7 yrs once  told me that i would NEVER get married if i kept dressing they way i did ! - it was hillarious ! ) but its not a lack of manners, they just express themselves differantly...     I would say that jews tend to be more expressive and vocal about their feelings. If someone is stressed believe me you will know about it. But its not looked down on.

zji1Dkruaa	a Degree IS definitely Important in getting a Job in Iran , but what plays the Key role is having relationships and knowing Mediators !  otherwise you might end up working somewhere that has no connection with what you have studied or  getting a salary lower than you deserve, which i witnessed Several Times !  Btw in Iran , a University Degree also plays a great role in finding a Decent Spouse  :p|`|kgNkuNOJaa	In Iran ??? well it really depends  :  1- u have a fellow in charge so that he fixes the job for you with the highest salary ever.(with or without degree...no difference)  2-study for the rest of ur life and work as a cab driver or a low level clerk ( with a post graduate degree or higher )|`|vtafeEIJaa	education is for all but money prevented lot of we africans having this life time experience|`|PtZSQ3D0aa	i always thought having better education means having better job  good luck!!!!!!!!|`|QWavO7Feaa	Well, for persians yes. specially in Iran. For us Iranians it is important to get the right education and that is higher than a Masters Degree. Very Important!!!|`|PbrGLvonaa	I'm gonna answer this, though I'm not really Persian. It's very interesting.    Master's Degree is a definite plus in a resume, and yeah since the world economy is collapsing due to America spending money in useless wars (the Mistake USSR made too), businesses and companies have become stingier in hiring applicants. And it gives big points when you are hitting on girls. I mean i'm 17 and I never had a girlfriend, i never even got a girl to like me, no dates too. So I think chicks dig professional money men.    Master's Degree is certainly a benefit, 2 more years of education can result to a lifetime money-making. It will be pretty hard for people who need to find pro jobs and make money as fast as possible.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Hi Mary, I think a Masters degree will definitely be a plus when you are looking for a job. I got my Masters degree in May and now going for my PhD.:)  Education is never a waste- particularly for a woman;-)    Good Luck!|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	Salam Mary,    In this day and age where finding a Job is proving more difficult than ever before where economies of the world collapsing, Employers are now looking for people with Master Degrees than just a Degree. Its important to get your Masters now than say 5 years ago if you want to find a decent job with a good earning.    Right now I`m studying Interior Design in University in the UK and I will definitely go on to study Masters.Sure, its another 2 years upon my 5 year course, but with a Masters Degree, it will be easier for me to find a good job, here and overseas.     Chakereem yes? :)|`|72aa4d0937174be512576dfccdea6b0eaa	without a degree in highlevel  fields  here in iran there is no chance of having a good  living in the future

The passport office will have to decide who knows how to spell your surname correctly. (you or your doctor)|`|hviykDAraa	im not sure if they will accept it because they may think its been tampered with.   If i were you i would take it back to you Doctors Surgery and expalin, its clearly not your fault and they should get him to alter it agin for you!! Just ring or call in and explain!!     You could ring the passprt office and ask if they would accept it if you altered it!

Maybe, that letter alone will be enough to solve your problem.  Or maybe, you need to get the assistance of the consulate together with the doctor to attest to his mistakes.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	You will have to get it changed - the passport office wont accept it.  You may have to fill in a new form but I'd insist on not having to pay for it again.  (Why did you pay your gp for it in the first place?!)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I would take it back to the doctors and ask him to correct it, and write a note to say he has corrected it, signed by him again of course!

CfjxKLHDaa	For a person who saw the buildings from construction until they collapsed, I feel very sad and know there will always be an empty space.  Future generations will not feel this loss because 11 Sept 2001 will be seen as 7 Dec 1941.  People do not read enough history in detail to at least get some idea of what was really lost.    I will feel sad because when I am a grandfather, young people will not feel the sadness and understand the reality of the loss.|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	When I see them on the older episodes of "Friends" (the television show), it's sort of nostalgic.  It reminds me of the day - I was a sophomore at Madison High School in Brooklyn and I was skipping class to go to Starbucks.  I still have this old poster that I used to have in my room from like 1992 when my family and I first moved here from Europe - it obviously has the WTC on it.  I had to take it down because it doesn't seem like the same New York ...|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	It makes me sad.  grew up with that building there. Can't see it and not think of that day.|`|q3qJIC5raa	I think of those we lost that day.    I knew the men of Rescue 1, some of the bravest around. I lost a lot of friends that day.|`|EI4v7tEHaa	Im not American but i feel a bit sad for the people involved.|`|mDDUsNG9aa	I worked at the site during the recovery efforts in the aftermath of 9-11 and when I see pictures or see the towers in old tv shows or movies I get a chill that is so numbing. I work not to far from the site now and it is a real shame what the politicians have done to hamper the efforts of rebuilding the site. The site should have been rebuilt already..|`|eDOaO4guaa	It reminds me how much we take for granted.      I had seen the towers growing up and never stopped to appreciate them.  On a field trip in high school, our class walked across the Brooklyn Bridge, and I snapped a random shot of the bridge with the WTC behind it.  Little did I know, this picture would be a testament to the fact that I'd seen them before they were destroyed.  Now when you watch Friends or the opening credits of Sex & The City where they're shown, I feel an overwhelming amount of disbelief.  It all seems so unreal, that two giant skyscrapers could fall down to the ground, almost straight down.  The people that came together that day, the people jumping out of the building because they knew there was no chance of rescue, the people who watched from the streets and the bridges, the plumes of smoke... it all pops into my mind whenever I see old clips of it.  I think of the people on the planes, and how amazing those people were on United 93.    It makes you realize life is precious and you should never hold a grudge, and you should always forgive.  You never know when it might be the last time you see someone.|`|AA10878759	Makes me very sad....|`|PdBOR3OSaa	Wow that a Deep question  !     I reflect on the events of that day & sometimes get flashbacks of the events.

It's very sad to see New York's skyline and not see the WTC. I feel for everyone who lost someone there.

I think most Chinese girls won't be interested in you.    Appearance do matter, it's what get you in the door, but it's your personality that keeps the girl.|`|AA12026078	It does not matter how big your belly is but how fat your wallet is.    I know both fat Chinese men and fat foreigner who have very lovely girlfriends.    But yes in general dropping the weight would be good for you.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	I have seen some ugly foreigners here with young beautiful Chinese women. There are many more overweight Chinese men than women also. You should try to eat healthier for your own sake. But don't delay coming to China just so you can lose weight and get a Chinese girl, that's just dumb.    I have lost weight since coming to China, but I know a lot of my friends have gained.|`|df2967ba3b98a55acb429d5198b3500daa	Really depends on how much weight you're talking about. "Morbidly obese" is a lot different than "slightly overweight".    Chinese girls do not look at appearance in such a heavy light as western girls do, but only to a certain extent. If you're a little overweight they can absolutely see you as a good catch because being a little overweight means you eat a lot - something associated with being a good provider.    You will lose weight without trying unless you eat at McDonalds every day. If you eat the local food you will find yourself losing weight even if you don't change your lifestyle habits aside from food. I came to China in September (to teach) and lost 10kgs in my first 2 months and have kept that weight off since then.|`|LZJPMl8raa	Do some exercise in your daily routine|`|nfu6LiVXaa	Yes, you should drop the weight before your go to China. It's not to attract girls there, but to ensure you have a safer and more economical flight to China. Seats on an airplane are designed for the average sized person and airlines might require you to purchase an additional seat just to make sure you can sit comfortably (which I am not sure how much more comfortable can you be). Plus, reducing your weight will lessen the health problems that plane ride/turbulence can cause - ie. blood pressure, blood circulation, etc.     Once you're in China, you'll mostly likely lose more weight because 1) you're not used to the authentic Chinese cuisine (it's not Panda Express or Manchu Wok anymore), 2) you won't have your car and you'll be walking most of the time.    In regards to the "good catch" part, it's only chubby wallets that make up the "good catch". It's ok to be chubby as some people still see chubby as cute and cuddly. But do know that their "chubby" is more 'average' here.
qUiQF8x3aa	Better to get your friend to arrange a car or motorbike. He'll know the best deal available.

First off asked your friend he should know.  My next advice is if you never been here before and know the driving habits of Thai people, your asking for trouble.|`|3P1EEZGdaa	Before I had a car in Thailand I tended to use Budget for car hire. Occasionally I used Avis; it just depended on who had the best deal going - sometimes Budget had a book 5 days get 2 free deal in the rainy season (May to October), sometimes a free upgrade, etc. etc. From Budget's .com website you can book cars worldwide, including Thailand. Price starts at about US$40-45 per day.  https://www.budget.com  Driving in Thailand, Bangkok especially, is 'interesting' and not for the faint-hearted. There was a question about the differences for a visitor from the uk driving in Thailand in this forum last week and there have been quite a few similar questions before. If you're interested I guess that you can find them by searching YA previous questions. I recommend taking a look. If you're only driving in the countryside it won't be so bad but you still have a sporting chance of encountering some driving techniques that you haven't previously seen.

If they are real cops, they will do that. The same goes with showing ID. You just never know whether they are fake or real. Some years ago, in Belgium, some guys dressed up as police officers, stopped mainly tourists asking for ID and then taking their wallets and running away. Even asking for the badge can't assure you anything. Also, some years ago I got stopped by a police officer in Indonesia who tried to frame me by asking me to pay for a fine. I insisted he take me to the police station to see his supervisor. He quickly let me go afterwards.|`|40SxN3uGaa	I don't think you have a say, unless you actually want to get them pissed off. My mother (who is a foreigner) has been living in Tokyo all of her life and even she gets stopped by the police once in a while. Just make sure to ALWAYS have your alien card with you, otherwise they might take you to the station, which did happen to my mom a couple of times, before she finally got sick of it and since then, she's always had her alien card in her purse. Its protocol and Japan is always so uptight with security, so it can't be helped.
xs2mpYjWaa	Yes you do have an accent. An American accent, a midwest one at that. There is no such thing as a 'non accent'.     Honestly, the Australian accent does sounds ridiculous being faked. Only people born here and those that have lived here for at least 20 year would have a half decent Australian accent.     In a lot of movies, you can't notice the accent, the ones you do are really bad, that's the only way you recognise them. I wouldn't worry too much, if they really want an accent, a half assed one will work.     Learn some slang, that would sound much better then a poor attempt at an accent. Even if your American friends think you sound good us Aussies will think you're a joke.     Here's a site http://www.koalanet.com.au/australian-sl... but take into account, we don't actually use all of those words, many are 'crocodile dundee' slang. But it should help you sound a more realistic Australian.|`|o65klEwWaa	The trick is to get the e's and i's right.    Take the number "six". Aussies pronounce it "seeks". So swap i's for a double e. Fish is pronounced "Feesh".     Not that you are necessarily interested, but Kiwis (New Zealand) would say "sux" because they pronounce i's like a 'u'. Fish is "fush".    Generally Australians lengthen their vowels. They go for a "sweem" in the "pierl". Yet some words become shorter, like "Year". They tend to shorten it to "yee"    All names get truncated to end in 'O' or 'E". Such as postie, ambo, Stevo, etc etc    Otherwise, watch for Americanisms which Americans never seem to realise they say, such as Mom, Vacation, attorney, drug-store, swimming-trunks (mum, holiday, lawyer/solicitor, pharmacy, cossies/bathers).    Hope that helps a bit.|`|1Itiv0Pzaa	How can you have a "non accent"? God you Americans are dumb. You have an American accent. Had to say that.

As for how to lean it, well DON'T watch any of our crappy drama TV shows that somehow get exported to the UK, they are typical Bogan accents and you don't want that. Plus they're boring as hell.

Good for you that you are an actor reaching out to Aussies via yahoo to try and get it right but just as I would have predicted, Aussies just have to put down every other nation except their own. It is in their nature, it is called " Tall Poppy Syndrome" and it means that they put down anyone who tries to better themselves. To me, it is just a total lack of self esteem to do that...Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in your acting career and I would suggest that you watch some Aussie movies such as the " Castle", and " Muriels Wedding" to be able to mimic the accent...it is not as hard as these other answers make it out to be.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Most cell phone providers have a "Go-Phone" plan - its pretty much a pre-paid cell phone plan through Verizon, Sprint, AT&T(Cingular), etc.  These are pretty good plans, but I think you pay them on a monthly basis (i.e., for Verizon, as an example, you buy a specific type of phone that is within the Go-Phone plan, and you pay for a "plan" - it's around $70 for 400 minutes).  I do believe you can also purchase a Virgin phone, as well, which has better pre-paid deals - these should be available at an outlet in JFK, or, in the worst case, the department store Target.  It's unfortunately not as easy (or cheap) to get you top of the mill Nokia on a pre-paid plan here as it is in Europe, but if you're willing to pay about $50-$100 (the phone itself will be the kicker), you have options nonetheless.

N4ZAzxdMaa	Railways were first introduced to India in 1853. By 1947, the year of India's independence, there were forty-two rail systems. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, becoming one of the largest networks in the world|`|YwdFUCQtaa	Old Indian Railway in good condition, thanks.|`|R4F05z4Faa	Indian Railways were first introduced to India in 1853.|`|kvTbCLKyaa	More than a century.

On 16 April 1853, the first passenger train service was inaugurated between Bori Bunder in Bombay and Thane. Covering a distance of 34 kilometres.|`|owjDBCc7aa	The novel plan for the introduction of a rail system, transformed the whole history of India. This innovative plan was first proposed in 1832; however no auxiliary actions were taken for over a decade. In the year 1844, private entrepreneurs were allowed to launch a rail system by Lord Hardinge, who was the Governor-General of India. By the year 1845, two companies were formed and the East India Company was requested to support them in the matter.     The credit from the UK investors led to the hasty construction of a rail system over the next few years. On 22nd Dec' 1851, the first train came on the track to carry the construction material at Roorkee in India. With a passage of one and a half years, the first passenger train service was introduced between Bori Bunder, Bombay and Thana on the providential date 16th Apr' 1853. This rail track covered a distance of 34 kms (21 miles). Ever since its origin, the rail service in India never turned back.     The British Government approached private investors and persuaded them to join the race with a system that would promise an annual return of 5% during the early years of operation. Once finished, the company would be transferred under the Government ownership, yet the operational control will be enjoyed by the original company. In 1880, the rail network acquired a route mileage of about 14,500 km (9,000 miles), mostly working through Bombay, Madras and Calcutta (three major port cities).     By 1895, India had started manufacturing its own locomotives. In no time, different kingdoms assembled their independent rail systems and the network extended to the regions including Assam, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. In 1901, a Railway Board was formed though the administrative power was reserved for the Viceroy, Lord Curzon. The Railway Board worked under the guidance of the Deptt of Commerce and Industry. It was comprised of three members - a Chairman, a Railway Manager and an Agent respectively.     For the very first time in its history, the Railways instigated to draw a neat profit. In 1907, most of the rail companies were came under the government control. Subsequently, the first electric locomotive emerged in the next year. During the First World War, the railways were exclusively used by the British. In view of the War, the condition of railways became miserable. In 1920, the Government captured the administration of the Railways and the linkage between the funding of the Railways and other governmental revenues was detached.     With the Second World War, the railways got incapacitated since the trains were diverted to the Middle East. On the occasion of India's Independence in 1947, the maximum share of the railways went under the terrain of Pakistan. On the whole, 42 independent railway systems with thirty-two lines were merged in a single unit and were acknowledged as Indian Railways. The existing rail networks were forfeited for zones in 1951 and 6 zones were formed in 1952. With 1985, the diesel and electric locomotives took the place of steam locomotives. In 1995, the whole railway reservation system was rationalized with computerization.

PSaXvIyWaa	Well are you just going for a visit and then returning? If so then why not? You said yourself you are only 24 other than your GF you don't have anything else holding you back.

If she really loves you she will wait other wise you know her true feeling.  If she is doing her Masters she needs to think about her studies anyway.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I think you have two decisions to make- do you want to stay with your girlfriend and do you want to go travelling, and I think if you take the two decisions separately you'll find it easier. Assuming that your girlfriend would not be able or willing to leave her Masters, if the answer to the second would be yes, you are left with do you want to stay with your girlfriend and travel while she stays at uni, or do you want to travel and break up with your girlfriend. If the answer to the second question was no, you'd be left with are you going to stay with your girlfriend and maybe go travelling at a later date, or are you going to stay with stay with your girlfriend and not go travelling at all?   I think you need to discuss it with her obviously, but what you need to do first is work out which is more important to you. You say what's to say you'll still be together in 3 years but what's to say this opportunity won't come up again? If you think you and her have a chance of being together then maybe you could use the next 3 years to work and save some money up so it's something you can do together when she's finished her masters? Or maybe she just wouldn't be into doing that sort of thing anyway, which could suggest that there's something fundamentally incompatible about the two of you anyway. I think you have to have a certain type of mindset to be able to leave the security of everyday life to go travelling for a long period of time like that.   If you go, there's nothing to say that you and your girlfriend would finish anyway. Is there an issue of you wanting to be single if you went away, or would you be happy to have a girlfriend at home? If you wanted to be single then that would suggest you're possibly not as committed to her as you could be anyway. Long-distance relationships are difficult, I won't say they're not, but me and my husband managed for a year and we're married now (obviously!). As long as you trust each other and are prepared to make the effort involved in a long-distance relationship then there's no reason why you shouldn't go while she stays and finishes her Masters. It's much easier now than it used to be with Facebook and Twitter and all those things.   I don't envy you having to make this decision, it's a really really hard one. It is the sort of decision that can alter where your life goes which makes it even harder. I hope you don't choose one and end up resenting the other- although I suggest looking at it as 2 separate decisions the 2 are obviously not mutually independent because each affects the other, which is why I think it's really important that you discuss this with her.  Good luck.

Fz5TLaLDaa	You can buy 2 day tickets for Universal / IOA direct from Universal. If you still have the energy then you could just buy a one day ticket for Seaworld - this would cost about the same as a pass for all 3.    Getting to Universal on public transport is a drag especially in the heat of September and taxi fares are expensive. Personally I would wait until I got there to decide what to do and then I wouldn't have paid out for a pass in advance that I didn't use.    You don't say where you are from but if from the UK or Europe you can buy a 3 day pass for Universal for 99 from the usual agents
rVUvopaLaa	if you really want to be certain seek professional help from a property valuator.  one way to get  through this is to seek help from a commercial bank. ask for a photo copy of the land title and have it valuated from a bank.  this is the same bank that will process your payment should you consummate the purchase.  do not rely the government valuation from the bureau of accessors they are useless.  however they can help you by checking if the property is clean and have no problems along with it.  you will find out from there the property history and all.    before you buy the property make sure to agree who will pay the capital gains tax.  if the price includes the capital gains or not.  in most cases the buyer pays the capital gains tax.    hire a reputable lawyer to help you out and who can represent you in case you are away.    there are many sellers in the Phils sell property having the tax declaration only or untitled property.  one reason is the property was subdivided maybe hence it's not titled yet.  or it was owned by someone else before having no title.  if that's the case make sure to check the bureau of accessors.  make sure the title records in the bureau is clean.  but to save you from too much hassle like having the untitled property to be titled under your name do not buy the property. period!     one thing worst in the Phils there's not too many real estate company that truly works for both the buyer and seller.  most of them are only after the commission for sure so be cautious about this.  so your best bet hire a reputable lawyer.      good luck|`|Imqb5ueqaa	Get yourself a lawyer.

In the north, there can be snow coverage for 4-6 months of the year. Coastal cities (especially in the west and south) often don't have much snow, just cold temperatures and rain. And in Stockholm, I consider winter to last from late November to mid March (first substantial snowfall, on average, to last). Spring would be March-early June, summer is June-August, and autumn is September-November.|`|24VQa5Ygaa	I live in Stockholm and Im my opinion, it gets colder at the end of September but  its autumn and last until mid December these days (warmer than I remember it used to be in December).

It's true that a majority of argentineans are of white european descent (mostly italian and spanish) but they are also mostly warm and welcoming towards tourists and foreigners, no matter what their race. Plus, Argentina is open towards the world, why would anyone stare at you because of your race? They might stare if you wear soemthing very unusual, have blue or green head, or lots of piercings in the face. They'd stare because this is something still very, very unusual to see. But those stares would also be in a very curious sense, not negative or disapproving.

There are about 21 different purposes for which Schengen visa are issued and we have 25 European countries which issue Schengen visa for visiting or business purposes for up to 90 days to all non-European Union member countries except Andorra, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Mariono, Vatican City and all countries outside of Europe except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), Israel, Japan, Macao (SAR), Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Singapore, South Korea, USA, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  For other purposes and stays longer than 90 days a visa is required by every country which does not belong to the European Union/EEA.    So unless you specify the country you want to go to and the purpose of travel you cannot expect a good answer.    What Anja H has correctly listed are some, but not all of the requirements for a tourist visa.

26cnysY3aa	temple is VERY expensive!!    so be prepared to spend a fortune!    here is any example i was in temple bar on wednesday..and in temple bar pub it cost....12euro for a pint and a half of Budweiser and 7.50 for a bottle of blue wicked!!!    EDIT..You'll be mad to get a taxi from the airport to the city centre! it cost you an arm and a leg!!   There are buses outside the main terminal!   go for a Dublin bus not the "city link" the city link cost you around 6euro where the Dublin bus goes to the same place for 2.20!!   Oh and the weather....bring an umbrella!!|`|AA10985791	That hotel is right in the middle of everything, Temple Bar has everything there, but its pretty small, so you'll find your way round in an hour.    the music in temple bar is very mixed, so there will be 80's, trad and modern all in the one night, so don't worry.    drink is about 6.50 a pint, but the pubs stay open late with no cover charge, so be like the Italians and sit over your drink, other wise you'll be skint    A taxi should cost between 30-35 from the airport, if you do get a taxi tell the driver you come over all the time.  Other wise you can get a bus that will leave you on O'Connell Street, so you'll need to cross O'Connell bridge, head towards Westmoreland Street, and Fleet St is a small street that runs adjacent to it, the bus is about 5.      The weather will be approx 10c, might rain, might not, you know yourself.  If you are staying in Temple bar there will be no reason for you to worry about travelling anywhere else, its all there, the only journey you'll need is the one to the airport and back.      Enjoy your stay|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Temble Bar area is the best area for everything.  Has lots of pubs and clubs and lots of things going on.  Near to the centre.

We( Meaning my family and I) have had really good prices on several hotels all around Florida.  The first one that I would recommend would have to be the La Quinta Inn or La Quinta Inn and Suites. The hospitality that they have shown us in the past has been extremely Professional. Not only is the hospitality great, the grounds are very well kept. Not to mention that the complimentary breakfast is really extensive and tasty.  The second hotel that I would recommend would be the Days Inn.  they offer complimentary shuttle service to Universal Orlando, SeaWorld and Walt Disney World.  You can also enjoy the swimming pool area, and the spacious comfortable rooms. The also have an International House of Pancakes on site for your convenience. Great shopping and dining are within walking distance. I would say that the bonus would have to be the IHOP next door. You have to try there delicious pancakes. ummm ummm     Those are the hhotel'sthat we have stayed at that have really good service, prices, and locations. Another thing to look into is getting a CAA or AAA card. this helps with really good discounts, not only at hotels, but many parks and rrestaurants    Hope that this has helped, and have a really good experience in Orlando Florida, and maybe Ill see you there.

pdbc4souaa	First, you need to learn that for say, about the last 80 years, they have been called airplanes. The employers [the companies that hire people in that job] are referred to as "airlines."

If there's one thing they hate is to be called waiters / waitresses, even though that's what they really are (besides being trained in emergency landings).

Then call up Air China and ask them to point you in the right direction.|`|FuDHZPpNaa	I wanna fly them|`|7b51f5900b9697d954b3a92103dab02caa	Airlines employ "Air Stewards" and the standards required are very high.

dpKntiZoaa	I also agree with you, having seen many questions about "Europe the country" "what is the temperature in Europe" and so on, in the last few days alone.    It is true that some (especially American) media outlets summarise things like news as being for Europe and not specifiying the individual country.    Those persons which have broadened their horizons with travel, tend not to lump all European countries into the one-fits-all kind of terminology - but I see it from those who have not (and rely on internet and tv for their "knowledge) tend to find safety in putting us all into neat little boxes - and this says more about their intellect than anything else.    There is a very clear cultural identity in each of the countries in Europe (and even regions within), but I honestly cannot say there is a 'European" culture, but of course this is subjective as I am also one.      Unforuntately, ignorance is in abudance - and just like you I see terms like 'EU", "Schengen countries" "European" etc, used as inter-changable terms which then become meaningless!      For example I have lost count of the amount of times I have explained that the "Schengen countries" are not equal to "the EU" ones, or to "EEA" ones and those are not equal to "Europe"!    I also read the above with a bit of shock "Europe arguably IS one country" - that is so remotely not true!  e.g. Bosnia - not part of the EU or EEA, not part of the Eurozone, not part of the Schengen zone" etc..... but it is an European country.  The UK is part of the EU but not part of Schengen or the Eurozone - and therefore not following the same monetary policies or immigration laws of those in e.g. Belgium.    Afterall - what makes a country - surely it's culture and history has something to do with it's identity - and not just it's alliances.  This is an integral part of a country and it's people, and long may this be the case in my opinion.    So I know where you are coming from, agree wholehearedly, and the only thing I can suggest is to just keep patiently informing and educating those that are willing to be informed, and not to be worried about those who are not.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	I do not think that anyone in america thinks europe is one country that has to be one of the stupidest thinks i ever heard.  why would you ever think that.

How can a teacher make these mistakes?!    To be honest, I really don't know whose is the fault, it's very hard for me to judge, seeing that, till now I've never been out of Europe...    But what occurs to me is that, in the case of Americans, they are used to live in a country which is the federation of 50 different states and maybe this could make them think that the same is valid for Europe, and this isn't true, it would be very beautiful in my opinion, but for now it isn't so...     More in general, I think that people usually are more interested in their personal reality and more interested to study and understand the things that are closer to them rather than the things far from their experience...    Bye|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Germany is as different from France as Mexico is from the US, I don't think it can be argued in any way that Europe/EU is a country. Language, history, ethnic groups, culture, music, food, art, customs, appearances and pretty much everything else except currency (and that's only true for some countries) differ vastly. An overhead agreement between countries (like the EU) doesn't magically blend it all together, except for easy reference.    I went to a high school that was once listed as in the top 150 public schools in the US, and was part of the gifted/talented program there. I used to grade papers for one of my history teachers. Even at this school, which you had to test into, in the gifted program which required IQ testing over 133, in an AP history class, many people couldn't place NYC on an empty map. It was put in Pennsylvania, Ohio, along the Great Lakes, even in Canada, but rarely where it actually stands.    I live in Norway now (previously UK and Sweden), and most Europeans I've met can find Texas and Florida and a few other states on a map, as well as label the general area of NYC.     I think all of the above problems you mention are a combined reason. Media definitely contributes, the education system is seriously lacking, and people just don't care if it doesn't pertain to their immediate situation.|`|aMZ7IKysaa	Considering you are European, I would expect you know that Europe is a continent, not a country.  I would guess that people thought Great Britain was a country, and not a number of countries.

OK, it's not entirely true, but it can be argued... common currency in more and more states, common laws, even in non-EU members as Norway and Iceland, most of the laws arrive per fax, from Brussels...    Also, is it even true 'so many people' truly believe Europe is just one country? Isn't this a bit - vague? ...
qxOkoSsAaa	Be agressive...polite, but agressive and don't be afraid to walk away.  This is a way of life for these people so you should respect that.  Don't insult by giving a ridiculously small offer.  Start your bidding at about the 30% mark and don't be the first to shift price, make them come down before you go up. Don't be so eager to go up, make them work for their money.  You should be looking to pay somewhere around the 60% mark as your finishing price.  Don't be afraid to accept a drink from the vendor, this is also cultural and a social event.  If there are two of you going you should go for the good cop/bad cop approach.  For example, why my wife and I barter, we have already arranged beforehand what we like and what we want to buy.  When we approach the vendor, one of us will pretend not to like or want the item and then the vendor is working against the person pretending not to like in order to get the person who is doing the bartering to buy their product.  I have found this to be particularly effective.  Remember one thing, don't feel guilty about bringing the price down and any sob stories you may here from the vendor.  If they are not going to make a profit from the sale, they won't sell.  Also if you later find you could have bought the item at a cheaper price, ask yourself this - Are you happy with the price you paid, if yes, then you have not been ripped off.    I have experience in bartering in places all over the world, Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey Mexico amongst other places... Get the hang of it an it is actually a lot of fun.  I have many a time bought a useless souvenir item I did not particularly want just for the sake of bartering.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	Ask for the price, act like walking away and say 1/4 of the price after being stopped by the seller.

RliEKzuAaa	"British" accent generally refers to Londoners, and it's mostly based on what Hollywood feeds people. Because of that, if they did run into a "Geordie" or a "Brummie" accent, they might not even realize it's British. As other replies mentioned, US has regional accents as well but when I've talked to people abroad, many believe everyone talks like they do in Cali. Others thought we all talked like we're from Arkansas (country drawl). A short flight to New Orleans, for example, would prove differently.    Opinions of what sounds exotic, sexy, or intelligent tend to vary as much as opinions on anything else. For example, Latino accents are suppose to be "sexy". I grew up near the Mexican border, have friends from various countries in South America, and I don't find the appeal. On the flip side, my husband is from Bangladesh and I've always been attracted to his accent.    Accents vary in France too. They vary in India. The short answer is, most countries have regional accents and you will be stereotyped by what is most frequently heard by foreigners.|`|aMZ7IKysaa	When we see movies with british actors, they always sound proper and dashing, like Colin Firth and Jude Law, even Hugh Grant.

Not pretty!|`|DTNlqnOEaa	Blame the "movies " for that idea.    On the other hand, there are numerous American examples of accents that are all most impossible to understand.     Jim b. Toronto.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Well it is a bit like we Aussies calling every American a Yank or Yankee. Ignorance is bliss and we seem to think that what we see on tv is the only way the other half are. I lived in Florida for 8 years and I know very many southern Americans would be very offended to be called a Yank or Yankee. That is what northerners are called and southerners do not like being lumped into the same boat as them. So it is the same with the British accent as far as they are concerned. They watch a few sitcoms such as Mr Bean or To The Manor Born or The Vicar of Dibley and assume that all Brits speak the same way. Thats like saying that all Aussies speak the same way as Crocodile Dundee...oh wait...we do...lol Not really but funny anyway.|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Aaahhh.... I don no... (tee-hee)...  Wish I was  as "smart" as YOU ?!?!|`|oSogrQvDaa	Americans think the British accent is 'posh' / upper class because that's what kind of British movies there are.. like Elizabeth and all those historical re-makes.. they're all set in old England with everyone being upper class, lol. Unless of course they watch 'This Is England' lol, they should. It'd give them a different view of us. =) They just need to watch the right films, is all.|`|N83Po9PZaa	From Texas - even having never been to England, most people I know can tell where an accent is from, even when they vary. We might not be able to get in down to a 1 mile radius, but in general we can tell what country someone is from........personally, I wonder if we all sound the same to you guys. I can't stand a yank accent and then you have Canada....don't get me started. I call them super Yankees....when we travel a bunch, I try and control my accent around Northerners, I get stared at and they can't understand me, if I don't.    Brit, Scot, Aussie, German, etc ....something different is always nice to hear.|`|uLLQovSyaa	I have to admit I think the accent is cool.Not just "british" sounding others as well. We have certain dialects over here as well. I happen to live in the south so I have a southern accent.Then you have the Cajun,Northern,and even in the south there's different dialects.If I visited anywhere in Europe I probably wouldn't want to talk much because of my southern accent.lol!
aVJyU3Tjaa	Try STA Travel. I was planning to do a round the world trip at one point and they were very helpful. Its aimed at under-26 year olds and students.    On one part of the website, it shows you are world map and you can make up your own route, and when you click on different places and stopovers, it gives you information and tips. After you've created a route, it tells you how much it is. However, the flight prices quoted don't included taxes and charges etc so they're not as cheap as they seem!    Also Google 'travel budget calculators'. Try out different ones, to give yourself an idea of your buget.    I hope you have an amazing time, I'm so jealous!! One more tip, and the most important, buy the Lonely Planet guide 'South East Asia on a Shoestring' (about 16.99). One word: indispensible! I bought the Europe on a shoestring one when I was planning my travels in Europe and it was my bible!    Good luck and take care, sorry I couldn't be of more help.|`|IIC9e3JQaa	sta travel and trailfinders are great for round the world and interesting tickets - also good for hotels, things to do....    also, if you're (i think) 26 and under, or a student, you can get some great deals on sta travel    (went travelling a few years ago - australia and south america)

0ZfZulnzaa	If you mean can you go into your Provincial Vital Statistics to purchase a birth certificate yes you can go to the Vitals Stats office in your province, but if you do not live near one you will have to apply either online if your province supports this feature, or via mail or fax, if faxing or purchasing online you will need a credit card.     Included in the link below is the list of all the vital stats offices for each province in Canada.|`|iOI2RT6maa	Yea, usually it's better that you do.|`|zO8X89hYaa	hi|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	It's probably easier if you fill out the application form and send it by mail.     If you apply in person, all that does is let you give the form to someone, pay cash instead of by credit card, and you will still have to wait probably 8-10 weeks for the information to be processed, verified, and a valid certificate to be printed and sent to you.    I don't think by showing up you can get a copy of the birth certificate that day.
AA10186411	Well you got charged for a variety of things.  The CT being the most expensive.  But, you have to think.  You paid for sitting in the bed in the ER, for the CT scan, for the diagnostic x-ray, and plus the person who reads them has a fee as well.  That all sounds about right to me.
pTLcvsVfaa	About 2 years ago.    Its not really that popular though, mainly because of their lack of involvement with most frequesnt flyer programs.|`|c5njkH5Oaa	2-3 years ago|`|2woC2m2Waa	Virgin America, Inc. is a United States-based low-cost airline that began service on August 8, 2007. The airline's stated aim is to provide low-fare, high-quality service for "long-haul point-to-point service between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards".
PCpMqpP3aa	germany and the surrounding area? do you think it is some sort of little town?|`|RrEESD6Paa	I live in Florida as well. Sounds like you are going to have a blast.     I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap travel deals, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck and check out the link below for the site.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Well, Stonehenge is is England.  London is nice to just walk around in.  See Buckingham Palace and the guards.  Everyone tries to make them smile.  Many German cities are charming because of the architecture.  Sorry I can't give you more specifics in terms of attractions to see.  A good quality pair of walking or running shoes or light hiking boots should be fine for your feet.  You will need a warm coat or jacket as it doesn't warm up much in March.  It will still feel like late winter most of the time.  I know you want to see as much as possible, but cutting out too much sleep will leave you too cranky to enjoy yourself, so be be sensible with that.  And I don't know if you plan to drink German beer, but it's bitter in comparison with American beers (think Heineken, and more), so Americans usually order a Coke with their beer so they can pour a little in and sweeten it up a bit.  Try googling "London tourism,"  "Germany tourism," "Paris tourism," etc., and you should find some interesting things to see.  Hope you have fun!
soUGSKJFaa	Philippine Postal Service is a government run corporation to deliver posts, every town and city in the Philippines have an office or two.

Use the local post office (Philippine Postal Service) if you don't mid the letters arriving late.    A word of caution, PPS has a history of loosing letters.
