20090205083932AAmFlQP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When the Intelligent Designer makes a new species what transpires next?	Does the Designer tinker with the genetic information in utero, causing one species to give birth to another?  Does the Designer just make the new species appear out of thin air?  How many of the new species must be created to enable enough genetic diversity for mating and reproduction?  Do these creations take place simultaneously, or is there an extended trial and error phase?

Ok, the full quote was ""There is no God who condones taking the life of an innocent human being", but still.       That was lame, I admit.    Serious question though: In the same national prayer breakfast, Obama also said this:      “I was not raised in a particularly religious household," the president said. "I had a father who was born a Muslim but became an atheist, grandparents who were non-practicing Methodists and Baptists, and a mother who was skeptical of organized religion.”      Did that make you smile as much as I did when I read it?

20090205085052AASvcpR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this what regular Christians believe too?	Kk,      Is this what Christians believe?      -----      God knows everything that will happen, he created mankind ONLY to worship him... he knows what sins a person will commit, and what good things a person will do...    He could have already punished us in Hell for all the sins we are about to commit, but that way, we would not know why we are being punished...   Therefore, we have no free will, everything is already planned...    E.g. It had been planned for me to ask this question...,       Better example: I punch a random old man BECAUSE he stole my Big Mac BECAUSE he was suddenly hungry...   1) It had been planned for him to be hungry   2) It had been PLANNED for him to steal a burger, thus committing a sin   3) It had been planned for me to react by punching him...      -------   *No FREE will*      This is pretty much what Muslims believe (I am one too) (correct me if I am wrong):    http://www.godallah.com/future.php       Is this what most Christians believe, if not, why not? I think you believe God knows everything... why not what sins a person will do? Thus, no human having free will! Everything is planned...      If you out of "free will" donate a million dollars to charity to prove free will to me... You DID NOT do it out of free will, (do you believe) God knew : that I was going to ask this question, and to prove to me (free will) you were going to donate... GOD KNEW (do you believe) you did NOT have choice, it was going to happen...

If those religions are inspired by God, then doesn't that reflect poorly on God? Usually when a parent has not one, but many unruly and violent children, doesn't that reflect poorly on the parent(s)? Doesn't the parent share some of the blame for raising so many bad children?      All three of those religions have quite a long track record of murder and genocide. Can the amount of blood spilled in the name of those religions ever be justified?

20090205085041AARwsbC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: Why some people reject Christ?	Is it b/c WE brag too much about who God is, instead of letting God do the work through you. God knows He's good, and doesnt need anyone for ALL ETERNITY to stand up for Him, the spirit He puts inside you is HIS SPIRIT, and we show it through our talk and actions. And He chooses the right vessel, to use, and if you let your flesh (pride) get in the way, it wont be a good result. Because when you hang around people, or look up to people, you begin to pattern after t heir ways AUTOMATICALLY, and  same with God when we spend time with Him, if you dont believe in God, try Him b/c if you know that God is good (by examining yourself) and He is fire and holy, you pattern after those ways, and who can stop you? CHRISTIANS JUST YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS!

20090205085824AAspxEd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it Christian-like to tell people that God 'doesn't want them'?	Whenever I resist a Christian person's attempt to convert me, often times they will follow it up with "Maybe God doesn't want you."  They claim that God only wants 'certain people' and some people are destined to forsake God and abandon him (with the result being they will eventually go to hell, of course).  Isn't it a bit snobbish to think that God has a special place in his heart for some and not for others?   And if I choose not to believe, it's only because I have free will and a logical mind, which are god-given gifts.  Wouldn't God want me to use my brain and my free will?  Wouldn't God want me to ask questions and challenge old beliefs?  If I truly disagree with something (like bashing homosexuals), don't I have a right to do what I think is right?  Or must I obey unquestioningly like a slave?  God gave birds wings.  God gave bears strength and deer swiftness so they can survive.  Don't I have a right to use my gift (my brain)?

20090205085539AAku8Z1	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is this normal or anti-social?	I don't know if anyone else feels this way sometimes, or if I just have issues. Sometimes when people think they're being polite and courteous to me, really they're just making me angry. Like when someone holds a door open for me. Often that just irritates the hell out of me. I take that as unwelcome; I didn't ask for it, why should I thank you? I can open the damn door myself! In some cases when I'm really having a bad day and someone's pulling that on me, I have ignored them and gone up to a different door and opened it myself.    Also when people greet you with "how are you?" It is practically required that you say "fine, how are you?" back to them. First of all, maybe I'm NOT fine, but if I tell you how I really feel, then I'm "wierd." Second, I don't really care how you are today, so why am I required to ask you?   I must really sound like a jerk.. I don't go out of my way to be an ****** to people, just some of the "common courtesy" rituals that we are obligated to go through really tick me off sometimes, and I want to know if others feel the same way.

The Quranic revelations too ended with the Last Prophet, s.a.w., thus clearly shows that Muhammad s.a.w. was the last teacher and a guide for mankind, who loves everyone and forgives everyone.

Someone said in an answer that you should tip a to-go waiter that just takes a to-go order because they are not having regular tables to wait. It's not our fault as a customer. Then what happens if we feel that McDonald's pays too little even as minimum wage, should we all start tipping to make up for the salary? McDonald workers work hard and deal with a lot of BS from the managers and customers.

20090205092840AAjQ41m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fundies: Why wasnt God more clear about abortion when he inspired the Bible?	I lean more towards universalist beliefs myself, but anyways, I'll ask this question in terms of fundamentalist beliefs. Let's assume that God is above time, so he knew before the Earth began that Roe V Wade was going to happen. Let's also assume that the Bible is the inspired word of God.      Abortions have been going on since the dawn of time, going all the way back to before the days of Moses, through Roman times, and on in to modern times. When those 10 commandments were written on those rocks God gave to moses, couldn't he have been a little more clear in explaining exactly what a human life is? Why leave it up to people to make a GUESS as to what he meant by "thou shalt not kill"?  Given that there are 3/4 of a million words in the Bible, wouldn't there be room in there somewhere to clarify this issue? It would only take another 20 or so words on top of the  788,258  words that are already in there.  Why not outright say abortion is wrong and not leave any room for debate among present and future Christians and Jews? How many Christian women have had abortions, who wouldn't have had them if the Bible  were a little more clear about the issue?  I know you feel that that any born again Christian is just supposed to know what God meant, and interpreting the Bible in a way other than "God intended it" is just people making up excuses for their wickedness, but let's not avoid the issue of why leave any room for debate at all? What was God thinking?

He was inspired to create FSU when he was beaten by Skinheads and was sent to the hospital with brain damage; ruining his plan of becomming a lawyer. The "gang" FSU (in the beginning) was a Straight Edge group that went to hardcore shows, but more famously beat up Skinheads and other like-minded groups. What they didn't have in numbers that made up in energy and ruthlessness. Now a large group with thousands of memebers residing in America, the once small group of friends has expanded into a countrywide "gang".

Well, in a period of rapid change, the old assumptions sometimes just don’t work anymore because they’re out of date. New knowledge, new understandings are much more widely available, sometimes to young people who are in school who aren’t weighed down with the old flawed assumptions of the past.”

20090205044758AACN4le	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is having forgiveness in my heart enough?	I think I am ready to forgive my family for all the hurt they caused me. However, I can never forget all that they did to me. I haven't seen or talked to them in almost four years. This question is for true Christian who know about what gets us into Heaven. I have accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. I want to forgive so that I can move forward. I believe that just as God forgives us he wants us to forgive. My family did unspeakable things to me so I want to forgive but I don't know how. How do I know if I am ready? I don't want to see them in person. I can't. I have come so far without them in my life. My mother was verbally and physically abusive to me my whole life and my brother molested me. Does God expect us to forgive all things or does he understand that some things are not forgivable? Is having forgiveness in our hearts enough or do we have to let the person know that we forgive them? I feel like I want to forgive because God wants me to and not because I am ready to forgive. What if I'm never ready? So can I just have forgiveness in my heart? Does God accept that as forgiveness. The problem is that my family thinks they are all right and that I am wrong. They would think that I have nothing to forgive them for. My new Christian friend thinks that I should see them in person (that will never happen) or at least write a letter. I would appreciate your opinions. Thanks in advance.

20090205095129AAfmI78	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah Witness Question About Jesus & God?	Hello all. I am a non-denominational Christian (not a J.W.). I study the bible independently and I am not affiliated with any churches or organizations at all, etc.       Anyways, I agree with most JW teachings regarding Jesus as God's son, and not 100% God as some Christians do. This topic has fascinated me recently & I have been studying it quite a bit and looking at both sides. I feel that by viewing Jesus as God's son, and leaving it at that, it makes the scriptures flow easier, and they make more logical sense. The trinity concept is confusing, and I think the reason is because it isn't really 100% accurate. I think it is clear they are 2 separate entities.      One thing I was wondering though, when God says, "I am Alpha and Omega/First and Last" in the OT, and Jesus says the same thing in Revelation, How do you view this?? Why does Jesus say Alpha and Omega too?      Also, in Isaiah says that of God that, "Isaiah 44:24 “…I, Jehovah, am doing everything, stretching out the heavens, by myself…”      But then the bible also says Jesus is the "Firstborn of creation and all things were made through him and for him."      I would like your interpretation of the above verses. Thanks so much in advance, and have a great day!

I'm just curious how anyone could explain to me...that if God has a "Divine Plan"...      someone explain to me what is the point of praying?...praying seems useless to me, because what if what you're hoping for doesnt fall under his plan? is he going to change it? just for you? what makes you special from the next fellow? having this Divine Plan seems useless if anyone who prays can screw up your plan...      && what is the point of trying?...if the big guy upstairs has it all figured out, and everything is set in stone...that means anything you do was just part of the plan...if i was in a third world country, and i was dying of starvation...that was part of the plan? for an omnibenevolent guy that seems harsh. with all the harsh realities of the world we live in...how can any of this happen under an omnibenevolent god? how can people be aware of these horrific acts and still believe god is so kind? if he created us (which he did not, technically my parents did), why would he insist on having individuals suffer from birth till death? the only logical explanation to me is that god is not omnibenevolent...      but realistically, not challenging the "god" concept is illogical...simply accepting it unquestioningly proves that having religion thrust upon individuals before they are capable of critical thinking is brainwashing. as a child, you aspire to please those above you. if religion is thrust upon you, you convince yourself that it is factual in order to please your superiors. by the time you reach adulthood, you are convinced that there is no alternative. individuals should not be presented with religion until they develop the capacity of critical thinking...      i have other thoughts...but i'm going to sleep...

I think this sort of proves how the bible was written by people and not god breathed. God would not be so different he would be the exact same if he was all knowing. Especially having the millions of years it took for us to be created. You would of thought he decided murdering every creature on earth was a good or bad thing by our arrival.

Acredito que a maioria das pessoas nem sabem que podem duvidar... nem sabem que os seus pensamentos s?o livres para isso... O filósofo DAVID HUME descreveu esse fato com as seguintes palavras:       "Os homens n?o ousam confessar, nem mesmo a seus cora??es, as DúVIDAS que tem a respeito desses ASSUNTOS. Eles valorizam a Fé IMPLíCITA; e disfar?am para si mesmos a REAL DESCREN?A, por meio de afirma??es mais convictas e do FANATISMO mais positivo."      Lembro-me de meus 15 anos, onde sempre fazia afirma??es positivas a respeito e repetindo pra mim mesmo: "ALELUIA, ISSO é PORQUE DEUS EXISTE"... porque essa AUTO-AFIRMA??O ocorria sempre na minha cabe?a? ela ocorre com os CRENTES? Eles sempre criam FATOS e associam a existência de DEUS para MITIGAR sua DESCREN?A?

"Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?  (The Noble Quran, 21:30)"       "It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things).  (The Noble Quran, 25:54)"       "And God has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. God creates what He wills for verily God has power over all things.   (The Noble Quran, 24:45)"       Thank You

20090204214359AA98WI9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Let Me Get This Straight (About god)?	Okay. Something I do not quite understand. The universe and the beings within it are complex. The eye, for example, is very complex. So people say "no way this all got here without a creator. It's impossible that it all "just happened." So, it must have been created.       Question: If the eye (for example) is so complicated that it is impossible that it "just happened" and needs a creator to explain it, how is it that the creator (who can create UNIVERSES and LIFE) itself isn't too complex to not have been created? The answer I always see is "god exists outside of time/space" or "god is infinte, he always existed." Shouldn't that make believeing in the creator more difficult?      Think about it. The god, by its very definition, is more complex than its creations. Therefore, wouldn't it be more probable that something like they eye would NOT need a creator, since invoking a creator would then logically lead to further incredulity, which was the basis for invoking the god in the first place? You can be so incredulous as to think that life and the universe must need a creator, yet this incredulity does not encompass the creator itself?      And yes, I know this is not an entirely new argument/question. But I sincerely do not understand the logic and have yet to have seen an answer that was satisfying one way or another.      Also, as a small aside, if you must presume there is a god, why not just be a deist then? Why choose a specific religion with things like redemption and divine intervention tacked on? Why must the creator be an intervenor?

When someone gets beaten in the street, nobody speaks up about it, let alone defend that person. They expect someone else to take care of it.They say they would, but when outside of a computer monitor, nothing happens for fear of consequences.

My argument was that this doesn't make sense, because Jesus was a hippie, liberal, pot-smoking socialist and people thought that I was insulting Him and decided to report my question. I don't get it!         "Jesus taught his disciples by the example of his life. His faith consisted of depending totally on God to provide all needs, food and shelter for the body, grace for the soul. He got by with a little help from his friends. He went into the wilderness, followed by thousands of people, and took no food with him, yet no one went hungry (Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14). When he was hungry, he looked to what was at hand (Mark 2:23), and he didn't worry about social conventions in eating it, such as not preparing food on the Sabbath (Mark 2:24) or washing up before eating (Matthew 15:1-2). He would dine with people thought to be sinners, taking no worry about his reputation or resume (Mark 2:15-17). He went where he felt called, when he felt called. He wasn't tied down by daily concerns."      "When Jesus sat down on the mountain to teach and explain his faith, he taught against the crushing anxiety that gives people cause to compete with one another for the resources of the earth. He taught against the fear for our lives that makes us hate one another. He taught against the striving and  the ambition which prevent us from seeing what is truly present here among us already. He taught us to forget about tomorrow, to let today's trouble's alone concern us. The same applies to the moment you live in, every moment. He teaches us to be concerned about our lives NOW, about our relationships NOW. That is the true meaning of his teachings about the kingdom of God and it's righteousness. When we seek it, we find that it is close at hand indeed."      "Your garden-variety complaint against hippies is that they are "dirty". People complain that they don't wash, shave, or pay attention to their appearance. However, Jesus certainly wasn't known for his cleanliness. He was criticized for not observing purity laws. He was criticized because his disciples did not observe the common religious fasting for the sake of purity. In the presence of Christ (and remember, wherever two or three are gathered in His name, He is there) there is no need for such fasting and concern for purity. As Jesus said, in response to the shocked Pharisee:      "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? So give for alms those things that are within; and see, everything will be clean for you. -- Luke 11:39-40"      It is the gift of God, present in the giving of thanks, in the sharing of love, in the fellowship of resources shared, that cleanses. Neither washing, nor rituals of purity, nor abstaining from certain foods or drink, nor wearing of special clothing, can bring godliness. People who are so concerned about "looking right", about dressing "properly", about "decorum" and the like, have not understood that God's presence is not known or seen in such things, but that the inward love of the soul makes all things clean for us.

N'oublions pas que Napoléon était corse et qu'à quelques mois près il n'aurait pas été Fran?ais mais Italien. Le président actuel est d'origine Hongroise, petit-fils d'immigré. Notre pays se compose dès l'origine des gallo-romains et des francs germaniques. Tout ?a pour dire que la France a toujours été un mélange.      Selon moi il y a trois 'critères' pour être Fran?ais :      1) être administrativement Fran?ais, c'est à dire avoir la citoyenneté Fran?aise      2) Parler le Fran?ais      3) Se 'sentir' Fran?ais. C'est à dire aimer la France, partager les valeurs communes au pays, et s'affirmer d'abord et avant-tout Fran?ais avant de parler de couleur de peau ou de religion.      C'est sur ce dernier point que notre pays conna?t actuellement beaucoup de difficultés. Je pense qu'il est urgent de redéfinir les valeurs communes qui nous rassemblent et de refaire de l'identité Fran?aise une 'fierté'.      Qu'en pensez-vous ?

If atheists truly believe that there's absolutely nothing beyond the physical realm why do so many of them get bent out of shape when someone tells them they will go to hell? Afterall, they truly believe "there is no God", right?

20090205102333AAAMJwi	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Concerning Restaurant Tips. Get A Different Job?	Ok so I've noticed a couple questions asking to you tip for to-go orders in a full service restaurant like Olive Garden, Red Robin, TGI Friday's, Applebee's, etc. I tip, and not just because I'm a server. A lot of people assume that these people make well above minimum wage but that is not the case. At some restuarants I would handle to-go orders, yep still making my $2.13 an hour. At another place I made minimum wage which was $5.15. Ooo big bucks there. I have read that us servers should quit complaining about no tips or find a different job. Well if we found a different job, there wouldn't be anybody to serve you your food. Why is that people have no problem paying $25 for a DVD starring an actor that makes tens of millions of dollars a year, yet when it comes to tipping on a to-go order can't even cough up a dollar or two?

20090205100947AAB86QB	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	2nd time I ask this...Why would a God fearing Muslim fight another God fearing Muslim?	If Mu'awiyah (La3een) was such a pious God fearing Muslim, why would he wage a war on Ameer Al Mumineen Imam Ali (as)? Did he not read the verses in the Quran about when a Muslim fights another Muslim? Did he not follow the Sunnah of the Prophet and listened to him when he said anyone who fights Ali (as) is a hypocrite? Did Mu'awiyah (La3een) even read or touch the Quran?         I ask this again since most just ran away and thumbed up any anti-Shia remark.      And dont get smart and bring Aiesha(ra) int his cause her story was way too defferent than Mu'awiyah (La3een)

20090205102617AAVU0Za	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is the word "Neg ro" bad?	I'm not racist at all or anything, but I can't perceive why the word neg ro is a bad word? As a Jew, if I'm called a jew, it's as if someone is calling me simply Jew or an Israelite. It's what I am. I understand that it was a word used commonly to refer to blacks in the Jim Crowe days, but Negr o in spanish means black. In fact, the first recorded use of the word in its context was when the Spanish and Portuguese captured slaves, essentially they just called them blacks in Spanish.       *But, even if that is the case of you all trying to disassociate yourself with the Jim Crowe days, people could just as easily use the word blacks or colored people in a derogatory way or otherwise less than complimentary manner to get the point across of their skin color.*      What do they call blacks in Spain? Africano Espanolas or something? What different would it really be to any of you black folks if someone were to say, "I hate black people" verses "I hate neg ros?" All said and done, I think that the word is a more historically accurate and descriptive word. The same way Caucasian fits white people of descent from the Caucus mountains.  And I think that the black community as a whole has set a horrible double standard for the rest of the world in it's use of otherwise self proclaimed right to use words like "*******" and "Ne gro." What's the deal on all this? I'm hoping perhaps some fellow... African Americans, can give me their opinion on this.

20090205100111AAwXDvI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where in the bible does it say that we can't have a boyfriend/girlfriend?	I asked someone this a couple sundays ago, and his answer didn't satisfy the question, so to speak, because it only left me with more questions. Here's the question: How can we find a husband/wife if we don't first know them as a boyfriend/girlfriend first?    He told me that the people in the bible days( i know, bible days?) didn't really know each other then and i said yeah that's because they were set up by their families and we don't do that anymore.   He then told me that our goal wasn't to find a boyfriend, it was to find a husband and the father of my children. He said that you love your husband, and you have feelings for your boyfriend. He said that love wasn't a feeling, it's an action, but love is a feeling. Love is a feeling that causes you to do things. The definition of love is to express affectionate feelings for a certain person. I then asked him: Well, if we never have a boyfriend, how are we supposed to find your husband, and how do you know if you will like him in the sort of... romantic sense. He also told me that you could have like, 10 boyfriends, but you could only have one husband. That's true, but marriage has never stopped some people from cheating on their spouse. So, is it more of a premarital sex thing? And from that we made up our own rule where we can't have boyfriends or girlfriends, or does the bible actually say something on it?

The ones asked by honest inquirers, that is.      As embarassed as I am to admit this, many of you may remember when I first started on R&S nearly two years ago, and yes, I asked that question.  I had only started to question my own beliefs about god, and the idea of consciously not believing in god was a foreign concept to me.  I had never thought about the detrimental effects of religion, or why it might be beneficial for atheists to engage in discussion with theists.  I cannot tell you how much I appreciated the few honest and polite answers from atheists when I asked that seemingly stupid question.

All my life I've enjoyed giving presentations and speeches and I especially love debating. However in the last few years this really annoying thing has stared happening whenever I give a speech.

It gets even more irritating when my notes start to shake, so I've had to start making up speeches as I go along instead of having cards to refer to. I know its good practise but I don't like it as much. I realise shaking hands are a natural reaction but it's so embarrassing! Any tips would be really appreciated as I've got a huge debate coming up soon, and I don't want to go up there with quivering hands!

So lately, Ive finally accepted that I can not be with the guy in my school whom Ive been thinking about for almsot two years. He got me real good and the worse is that I cant sleep. I told myself that there is no future between us and I can not provide him what he wants coz he's straight. But why do I still feel so sad?      I am finding it difficult everyday to just even go to school now and its affecting my studies badly. I dont know if I'm in love. How can I move if Im still in love? It really hurts me that I can not be with him but it hurts me even more coz every time we see each other he doesnt even care. We were friends last year but when I think he found out about my little thing for him things got really awkward and we stopped communication. i can't even approach him and it really hurts not to be loved back.      We're both 18yrs old. Euch its horrible for me at the moment and all my friends are saying that I should be having the time of my life. I was enjoying it until it hit me this thing. When you get ignored by someone you really care for, you just know that it feels like its the end of the world... I want to get out of this pain.. I can't go any longer, please help:(

20090205102914AAwoQ65	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the origin of Evolution?	Water and Earth, are the origins of Evolution:      Genesis 1: 11    And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.      Genesis 1: 20    And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.      Genesis 1: 24    And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after his kind: and it was so.      Take note that creation took six days, whereas evolution took thousands of years and generations (though not documented in the scriptures). An intelligent mind will not misread the scriptures as saying that evolution was complete in six days. And an intelligent mind will not conclude that the scriptures exclude evolution in respect to creation.

I have never been big in the religion thing, I just had faith and prayed only in times of dispare. I am trying to make a major change in my life and find God and have true faith and bring him into my life. I honestly don't have time to go to church, so I am just going to watch seminars on the internet. After searching seminars, I found that baptist seminars are the most moving, uplifting and inspirational. I feel like that is what I need catholic seminars are soooooooooooo boring. I have a question though, is baptist a big change in religion from catholic and is it wrong to change my religion, but then again...what do baptists' believe in in the first place. I just need some guidance. Thank you

In some translations, the heroine is called "Yeh-hsien", and in others, "Yeh-shen".      Are these just two different ways to anglocize the same name, or are they different names?      I'm also wondering if there is a meaning attached to either or both names.

Than the big bang theory came along. It’s a genetic fact that one species of animal can not magically become another species of animal. The naturalistic viewpoint clearly has determined that some species within the same class have different socio-developmental traits which implies racism not as an accepted practice but as a scientific reality. It takes a lot more faith to believe that gibberish than it does to believe that God did it. Furthermore, creationism can not, has not, and will not ever be disproven.

20090219110259AAOM3jv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do Mormons feel about taking anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs?	The reason I ask is because I used to have a Mormon friend who told me Mormons generally don't want to take anything mind-altering, which is why they don't drink any alcohol or even caffeine.  But what if a Mormon had a serious case of bi-polar disorder or a serious problem with anxiety?  Anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs are EXPLICITLY mind-altering drugs.  They wouldn't work if they didn't alter the mind.  Are there exceptions in these cases in the LDS church?

So atoms didn't exist, and the non-existence exploded (or had a rapid expansion of space/time (which didn't exist)) and happened to hang our galaxy in a perfect orbit, with a perfect planet to support life exactly?

How did a solid turn into a life form?   How & why did that first life form further evolve and turn into millions of other life forms?   Can a solid -a rock turn into a life form?   Let's do an experiment:   Place some things outside such as a solid iron bar, a solid steel bar, a solid plank of wood, a living flower with some grass around it, and a solid rock and leave them totally alone. Don't move them. Don't disrupt the setting they are in. Don't care for them in any manner.Leave them totally alone in the elements.Let nature take it from there.   Now wait a year (or more if you can) and go back and inspect them. What has happened? Did the iron get more advanced or did it start to deteriorate? Did it get rust and decay on it? Will it evolve and get better/stronger or worse?   Would it be about the same way with the raw steel? Was the flower still there? Did lesser foliage like dandelions, weeds, clover, spring up? Was the flower even alive? Was mold, mildue, insects, and rust present?  So-did it further evolve and get better/stronger or worse?  The wood. Better or show wear & deterioration?   If you are in a climate such as the northern, eastern, or mid western USA, the climate changes a great deal season to season. Very cold in the winter, snow, etc. Very hot & humid in the summer-rain, storms, windy, etc.  From these vast changes could the rock splinter, crack have mold on and under it? Is that evolving or dis-evolving?

From the Crusades where Christian knights massacred 40,000 in Jerusalem and then worshiped Jesus (A.S.) to today's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) which has kidnapped and raped tens of thousands of children who are then made to become their fighters, the Christians seem guilty of the very worst abuses against all mankind.      What are the roots of this appalling Christian violence? Is it in the treatment of their women who according to Paul's scriptures are to be submissive to their men? Is it to be found in the teachings of Paul, an acknolwedged murderer of Stephen who was the true founder of what is misnamed Christianity?

20090205115823AAPpaBw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do creationists not know the difference between a theory, and a scientific theory?	Theory (just a theory)- an idea.        Scientific Theory- a FACTUALLY COHERENT body of scientific knowledge that is understood to be a testable model capable of predicting future occurrences or observations, and capable of being tested through experiment or otherwise verified through empirical observation.      Hence, the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection isn't a "theory" as in "i just thought of something" (i.e. Intelligent Design), it is a scientific theory.      In a scientific theory there are FACTS.  The theory that there is gravity is now referred to as the "law of gravity"; no doubt, it was just a "theory" when Newton proposed it, and today, it is technically still referred to in the sophisticated sense as a scientific theory by scientists.  In Evolution Theory, that we evolved is a fact; Natural Selection is the theory (in other words "why are we evolving?").  The debate is between people who believe natural selection is the sole factor, vs those who believe it to be the primary factor acting in concert with random mutations and other things, and those who consider it to be a  partial factor.      Is this so difficult to understand?  I mean, at least come up with arguments that take longer than a second to dismantle.
20090203042306AAW0k5q	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Lesbians, ftm, other opinions please?	i am 22 years old i came out at age 15 as bi 17 as a lesbian and just a few months back i shared w/ a few of my close friends(that have kept my secret that i trust w all my heart) that i think i am transgendered. i have always thought myself as a "boy" my whole life but didnt really think about it till i was 20 and most people that barely know or know me well say things like "wow ur so much like a guy" or "your like the best of both worlds" for the most part i dress in guy cloths but sometimes i wear girly clothes. i always have had my hair long i just pull it back i wear make up and straighten my hair most days but i can not get out of my mind that i want nothing but to wake up and b a guy and its constantly on my mind. i know i only like women and have only been w/ women since i was 16 but i sometimes check guys out not sexually but in a jelous way like i want to b like them or look like them. i have known many trans people but i feel i dont fully fit in. i feel i dont fit in w/ other lesbians and i dont fit in fully w/ my girl friends (like when they go shoping etc) or my guy friends (when im w/ a group of them) but most my guy friends treat me like one of the guys(b/c im a butch lesbian not b/c i really feel my brain is that of a male) im just me, i am an amazing person who truly is one of a kind..im rather popular and have a lot of cool accepting people in my life, but i am too scared to fully come out b/c i think that transitioning would not make me happy b/c i would still feel like a "fake guy" w/ a crappy penis..and i get a lot of cute girls now and feel i wouldnt if i went any butcher and came out as trans and wanted the pro-nouns changed. its hard enough being accepted as gay by strangers but trans? i really wish the ftm surgery n such were as advanced as the mtf =( i guess i am asking are there trans people that do not want surgery? if so would being called he/him and going by a different name and coming out trans and trying to look like a guy but never fully transition help make u feel more whole? my question is for some advice from ftm's or from lesbians who may feel somewhat like me or anyone that has any helpful advice at all. i just feel alone and confused. thanks a lot 4 reading and responding!

20090203031542AAkYfdZ	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Muslims, I need your absolute honest answers again?	Let's say you meet someone in person and then end up in an online forum with the person and end up falling in love with the person. No doubt about it, you love this person and this person loves you with a deepness you didn't know existed. The two of you were made for one another, no doubt about it.      You set your heart and mind on marrying the person, but your parents find some reasons to not accept the person on some criteria that Qur'an does not suggest you use in choosing a marriage partner but no matter, if you obey your parents, you cannot marry the person. This will mean for you a lifetime of dread and loneliness along with severe immediate heartbreak that will take months of suffering through intense pain from the loss. Eventually you will marry someone else you don't love and you will ache for years on end for the person your parents said you could not marry. You are 24 or older. You will ache for 50 years from this loss.      Your most honest answers please, this is your heart and your life we are talking about, your pain that you will have to suffer through day after day while your parents nod their heads and say, "there, there dear, it's not that bad."      Would you at the age of 24 or older obey your parents or would you tell them you are going to marry the person anyway and that you don't understand what is Islamic in them trying to deny you happiness in life or choosing your lover and then follow through and marry the person?      Or would you break your heart and the heart of the person who loves you so deeply and truly, and who will also linger in pain for months from the heartbreak of losing you -- the person will be devastated as you will be -- and obey your parents at the age of 24 or older?      Remember, you will never find another love like this, nothing comparable to it or to this person. It's a once in a lifetime chance for a dream love that some people search for decades without finding. You will be completely fulfilled in this love. Your parents won't be living in the marriage, not in the household you and your spouse will try to build together as you spend each day and night there, and it is not their lover we are talking about, but the person you will be making love with.      I understand we are supposed to obey our parents, but if they told us to rob a bank would they not be exceeding proper parental authority? Why is it considered Islamic for them to choose our spouse -- our best friend, confidant, closest companion, and sex partner -- for us? It seems an intimatey personal decision to me. My parents won't stand in my place on judgement day and answer for me if I am asked, "did you love your spouse?" I don't want to have to say I tried but I couldn't because I was broken hearted and still in love with the one I lost, but I would say the truth just as I would risk rejection of my fiancee's parents by not telling them lies about myself or what I believe but what if that honesty puts her in the position I just described?      Honest answers, what would you do in that case? It's your happiness for decades on the line. Don't just blurt out you would obey your parents, try to think of some time you actually hurt from something or felt sad, then imagine that being magnified 100 times and going on for days, then weeks, then years. It's like volunteering for hell to go along with them in such a scenario, isn't it? How is it justified by Qur'an?

And since all life originates from females, for us mammals anyway, isn't the notion of a male god a reference to a time when women were thought to be nothing but a man's property?  Isn't it the females who give birth to and nurture the young?  Or, taking it even further, why would God need sexual organs if he or she can create life out of inanimate material?  Yes, the bible says HE created man in his own image, but do you believe everything in the bible?  Did Moses really write about his own death?  I think not.

20090205113729AAm1UJK	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Those of you who are generation Y, are you aware that the term "Asian" wasn't invented till the 1980s?	Generation Y YA users, how much do YOU know about the history of "Asians"? But you don't know about it much. If you are interested, read below and share your thoughts.      "The 1960 census racial categories included American Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Japanese, Negro, part Hawaiian, White, Eskimo and Aleut"      "The 1970 census racial categories included: Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Indian American, Japanese, Negro or Black, other, White, Hispanic origin of any race, and White, not of Hispanic origin. Mexicans were counted as white from 1930 until 1970, when they re-entered the census as Hispanic origin. It was a deliberate effort to count Hispanics without treating them as a race. They were to be considered a cultural/linguistic group. Using this reasoning, Hispanics can have a racial identification separate from their ethnicity. At the time, the census expected Hispanics to also select from the primary racial categories. Historically, the census counted and classified by race and national origin. Now the taxonomy included ethnicity."      Also, it was very close for the Japanese to have counted as White, and it is still a mystery as to why Indians are Asian, not Caucasian.       "In 1922, a Japanese businessman named Takao Ozawa filed for U.S. citizenship under the act; he did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions, but argued that people of Japanese descent should be classified as white. Associate Justice George Sutherland however, ruled that only Caucasians were white, and therefore the Japanese could not be considered white but rather were of an "unassimilable race," not covered by any Naturalization Act. Sutherland issued a similar ruling three months later in another Supreme Court case. This one, known as United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, concerned another alien seeking U.S. citizenship. The decision classified South Asian Indians as Asian for the first time, and not only affected immigrants seeking naturalization, but allowed previously naturalized Asian Indians to be stripped of their American citizenship, since it could be claimed that they had gained citizenship illegally—a claim often upheld. Once they had been stripped of their citizenship, Indian land owners became subject to the California Alien Land Law and similar laws against Asian immigrants. With the Asiatic Barred Zone Act of 1917 preventing new immigration to the U.S. to strengthen the Indian community, most Asian Indians left the U.S., so that by 1940 their population was reduced by half to 2,405."       http://www.understandingrace.org/history...

20090205114955AAt9bHI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: Why is being evil wrong if it makes that person happy?	If your answer is:    Because being evil ruins the happiness of another, and happiness at another persons expense is wrong. Then why is that wrong?    Is it wrong because it puts a burden on evolving the human race? That is our purpose isn't it? To be happy, and to evolve the human race? If i'm mistaken please give your insight. Since our purpose is the only reason why we're alive in the first place, why have we put restrictions on polygamy and drugs? If its social factors that deter polygamy and drugs, then do you believe morals can/should change? Morals are directed by society (Common sense), we learn from family, friends, any kind of social interaction to do actions that will unify us in creating a stronger preservation of our race - because it is our purpose. Do you believe that human moral values changing could possibly be a bad thing, since it only must follow one rule: to preserve the human race? If you kill 4 weak humans to save 3 strong humans, could that be considered moral someday? Now we would consider that an act of evil, but why, especially if we were only living the way we were intended too?

The quran talks about the lust story.      The problem is I can’t stop being gay. For example I can’t stop being the way I am. I can’t stop looking at men instead of women. This is a sin of mine. I have never carried out the crime or act of homosexuality. I have never had sex with a man or women. But being sexually abused at a young age is also a crime I have committed, my brother abused me but i never told anyone, because i felt it was not neccsary      I never hope to marry a women or a man. I am traditional and old fashioned. I will not marry women because I do not want to deceive the relationship. I will not marry a man because it is haram in Islam.       If i told my parents i was gay then this would make things much better, but would it kill them if they found out      My parents want me to marry a women      So I always think that if I was to die early then all my problems would go away. I will go to Allah and if I am a sinner then I will be sinned. I am not bothered if I am in heaven or hell, but most likely for me it will be hell. But I do not want to kill myself being by doing this I am not accepting life. Allah states that every human should have aright to a life and I decide when he is going to die.   I have read that there is a greater reward if you can control your sexuality. For example if you marry women if you are gay and Muslim then you are given a larger reward.       In my situation i hope to tell them the truth and be unhappy all my life.   I will never marry a women, or carry out the homosexual act.      Telling may parents will create problems, but they will find out some day. I will tell them that i will not marry a women, and not a man. Will ask for forgivness.      I am a sinner and will be sinned. I hate life and every minute of it. I hate myself. I dont even know how i am gay, was i born that way or did i turn that way         I have had many counselling sessions, and therapy seesions, they all say that i should accept my sexuality. But in my case i will not.      I am not a practasing homosexual. Read namaz and the quran                              So I can not stop being gay but I will not marry a man or a women. Am I carrying out the rights steps in life? And how should I continue life?   I have been to many counseling sessions, therapy and still believe that I am taking the right steps towards life. I have only some years to life but I believe that if Allah was to take me early then it would be better.

And how do I resolve my feelings of anger and resentment towards a society that uses secrecy to put barriers between a husband and wife?

20090219111314AA8IBcH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do we separate God into 3 parts the father, Son and Holy Spirit ?	Example for the trinity is Matt 3:16 is Jesus (the son) is baptized by John then the heavens open up and the spirit of God (holy spirit) descends upon Jesus like a Dove and the Father (God) speaks saying "this is my son whom I am well pleased." now I'm not doubting the trinity because its clearly stated in Matt 28:19, but more so the view in which we take. General view upon The trinity is three persons in one, but what if in actuallity it is God in all three ?         The example of God can not be at the same time the father, the son & the holy spirit sees weird to me. God is God. He is all powerful, creator of time and space and of all things. What is it that makes us think that God who is all this an more is incapable of being in more than one location at once, speaking in more than one location at once and be doing his work in more than one location at once. I think by saying God cannot be the son, spirit and God the father at the same time like the Matt 3:16 example seems to be placing God into this box. This logical reasoning our minds work.          Example, when Jesus prayed to the Father he cannot be both the son & the Father because he will be just prayin to himself. But if the trinity is three persons in one than in actuality He is praying to himself. So in that regard who's to say that God cannot be both the Son & the Father at the same time, and if he is praying to himself, who are we to say He cannot, He is God. He has the freedom to do as he sees fit.

I know this for a fact cause I have to wear glasses to see but during sleep paralysis I can see everything clearly so I must be making it up.   Well is it the same for an OBE?

Si una persona por ejemplo: Narra una experiencia que le sucedió, Y nosostros damos nuestra opinion, debemos tener cuidado en ′como decimos las cosas, porque ya ven que es facil que cualquier persona se ofenda  por haber malinterpretado.   Si alguien dice, por ejemplo, que vió un fantasma claramente y está seguro de eso.entonces si alguien reponde diciendo que "es sugestion la suya", es obvio que eso lo va a tomar como ofensa..porque?..simplemente porque queriendo o no, se ha ofendido la inteligencia de la persona, que es casi igual a decirle que es un tonto.Entonces la manera mas apropiada de responder seria, por ejemplo en caso de que responda un esceptico:" No podria haber sido sugestion?"..eso ya se sentiria diferente..no creen?..eso ya no ofende tanto. Lo que me encabrona a mi es que el esceptico que responde eso  lo dice estando tan seguro y ni siquiera tuvo el la experiencia y tampo es un investigador de esos fenomenos.

I just noticed that someone who answered one of my questions said that "faith is when you believe something that your brain tells you is incorrect".  I've always believed that reason is a necessary part of my faith.  I believe that without reasons to back up our faith, we risk being like the seed that grows and has no root in Jesus' parable.  I also think that reason helps us explain our beliefs to other people and to convince them of the truth.  What do you guys think?  Are reason and faith compatable?  Do we need to have reasons for what we believe?  If not, then what kinds of things should we believe by faith alone?

Im currently working and employed in my younger brother's business as an office secretary. He is married, have wife and kids living in another province. My brother and I the rest of the siblings and with our mother have a common woman friend who is married and have kids too whom we treated her like a family as well. When i started the job and during my early days in the company i noticed that woman friend is always visible and taking charge of the business, but more than that she seems very extra nice to my brother until i found out that they have an affair of which really shocked me and made me wonder and angry and mad and everything. But the thing is my brother tolerated it of which makes it more shocking. Pretending that its all about them being business partners. My sis-in-law knew the affair because the woman's husband informed her about how and when his wife and my brod been doing. And woman too asked her husband to leave their house and that they better separate. Because the husband believed the affair, husband filed for annulment of their marriage and the case is still in court no order yet. My problem is the woman is so paranoid that she wants me to leave the  job and she does things that would drive me away she took some of my duties and responsibilities and claim it her own now because my brother told her so, of which it is not true. My brother tolerated it just to pacify woman.  It seems like she owned the business and my brother has no say anymore. I see them always argue and both of them do violent acts throwing things. I heard my brother told her to leave for good but still she still came back in the morning and begging for my brod, but still he forgave her and their friends again. This situation happens almost everyday at work. Until one day in the workplace woman and i fought i could not stand it anymore in the presence of everyone at work including my brother who was listening and watching our altercation. She took a broken glass decor  and hit me, i picked a plastic stool to shield me from her attack but then she went inside the office towards the pantry and brought with her a kitchen knife and then she picked the phone and called the police and told the police that i attacked her although the police came but did not went inside the compound instead she went to the police station and made her report. I asked my brother if i will report it too, but my brother said no. The third day after the incident i went to  the police myself without my brod knowing it and gave my statement and version. The police read to me the woman's complain and version and as expected the woman reverse it. Claiming it was self-defense and that i attacked her. Right now i still report to work and i see her in the workplace as if nothing happened. I need some advise since the woman has no plan of leaving and she and my brother are still together. What kind of a woman is she, she's so horrible! What shall i do? Shall I stay or leave and if i leave the woman will have all the upper hand in the business and my brother will be at a loss. My brother never told me to leave and resign or look for another job and she never sided with the woman . In fact my brother and I care for each other and respect each other too.

I just observed this the other day.

I dont have much of an imagination, but my school booklet provides many things of which i have to choose six different characteristics that i will describe in the travel guide. I have chosen the following six:      1-average climate   2-education   3-sightseeing   4-arts and entertainment   5-crime rate and punishment for crimes   6-available ways of transportation      for number 5-crime rate and punishment for crimes, i would say that crime rates are low, due to good police patrolling, and well lit, clean streets.      for number 6-available ways of transportation, there could be cars, but everyone had the same exact car, or you could ride on the subway.      Any other ideas i could choose from that go along with the other 4 things on the list?

What I notice is that Indian people use a credit card for the majority of their purchases. Why? Even for the smallest amount, $3, they still use credit card. For every 10 Indian customer I have, 1 use cash or debit card.      I am not being racist, but this is what I notice from working.      We Americans are in a credit card crises.      It's a CREDIT CARD. It shows up on the screen to which button to press at the register, a credit button or a debit or a cash button, and there's many other tender button to press. I am 100% positive it's a credit card. Because you always have to sign it. Debit, you only put in your pin number or cancel it out to be use as a credit.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Jonas Brothers do not qualify as rock, am I right?       And if you're all dressing the same, how in the world is that unique?

Why do we believe in the concept of a human 'soul'?   the concept of *soul* is a figment of the imagination and only arose through the nonsense of religion      there is not a jot of evidence that we have a 'soul'      it's fiction      People will be outraged by the fact that I dare say we have no soul but there is no evidence - zilch - that a soul exists aside from what people want to believe.      Watch the insults fly.      America is like the days of Galileo when he was nearly burnt at the stake for saying/proving the world was round and travelled around the sun .... and wasn't the center of the universe      Souls do not exist ... Discuss      I come from Europe where less than 30% believe in any kind of higher power. Moving to the USA ten years ago I just can't believe the blind faith of 80% of the population.   It staggers me that people can blindly believe in something so obviously fictitious.   Oprah Winfrey stands on her pulpit every day and preaches to us about the Universe (God) and Spirit and everyone nods knowingly lapping it up and there is not ONE jot of evidence to back any of this tripe up.   I just find it incredible that people can be so accepting without critical judgment      *shakes head in disbelief*      "SOULS DO NOT EXIST. DISCUSS"

20090219112711AAICrYG	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is looking at child porn worse than adult porn?	In class today, my psych teacher was talking about child offenders and how looking at naked children on the internet turns them on. In our society this is completely morally wrong and I agree, but if you replace it with a woman/man that is just a little bit older, it is now morally correct because it's only natural for guys? What if it was natural for some men to look at children in this manner, would the argument still stand? What I'm trying to get at is what's the difference, is it the maturity (so if the child had developed features, it be okay) or is it the child's innocent mind (so if the child was aware of sex and what is was, wasn't forced into anything against their will, it would be okay) then it'd be exactly the same right? I don't mean to offend anyone here, I'm just trying to figure out why some people think looking at naked 13 year olds is disgusting and morally wrong but 5 years later it is completely fine.

20090219115013AAWkG9L	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is alcohol legal but marijuana is not?	For years i've been saying that marijuana is better off being legal than alcohol. In fact, I did a little research and found that some 75,000 deaths are linked to alcohol each year, and zero, yes zero deaths were caused each year by marijuana and its' short term effects. Sure people die everyday from smoke related problems such as lung cancer and emphysema, but cigarettes are legal, right?    Alcohol also has a history of making people do things they wouldn't normally do, sometimes to the extreme like murders, sexual assaults and robbery. The only thing i've ever seen or heard marijuana do to a person is make move a little bit slower and get a little confused and even then, most of the time i can't tell at all if someone has been smoking.   The only crime that comes from marijuana are the people who are getting shot on the street selling it and the arrests because it is illegal. If we legalize, we take away those two problems. I'm not trying to say we should ban alcohol, but why isn't marijuana legal if it virtually causes no deaths and can prevent more crime if it is legalized?

20090219120734AAG6aXR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ok, a question from an agnostic: why do so many non-religious people fail to place any value on human life?	I'm serious. On several of the message boards I frequent, there have been questions that are very similar to the one just asked about whether the crying baby should be killed.  Now, I understand the argument for early term abortion, but doesn't it seem a little bit disturbing that so many people think that a full-term infant's life isn't valuable? What's next? Old people? The mentally handicapped? Toddlers? People with views that make us uncomfortable?      Essentially I'm really wondering why so many people who don't have a religious foundation don't uphold the value of human life. Do we really want to live in a society that doesn't protect the intrinsic value of the individual?       Oh, and please spare me the examples of the religiously motivated carnage committed during the crusades. I'm asking non-religious people what their logic is.

20090219122104AAB9b0S	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Yahoo Answers: Can it REALLY change peoples opinions on Religion and help enlighten people?	Can this ACTUALLY be used as a tool to help enlighten people about such issues as the second coming of Christ, the End Times, Bible/Ancient/Nostradamus prophecies, and the Bible in general?      I've had my account for some months now. I thought this would be a great way to enlighten other people about the Word of God, and help save souls.      After multiple attempts to try to prove the End Times, Prophecies, provoke beliefs on these topics, and get people thinking, I began to come to the assumption that I am really helping no one. Its either people agree, or disagree.    "Oh yea thats true"   or   "You crazy lunatic thats all hogwash"      People here seem to have very sturdy opinions on any aspect of religious beliefs and I don't think trying to lead anyone to salvation through this could work?      The real way to lead people to salvation is through EXAMPLE, like Jesus did. But is it possible to help someone see the light by just writing down your testimony?      Has anyone on Y!A ever had any religious epiphanies, came to shocking (religious) truths, or been saved by someone trying to get through to them on this?      I am going to be a missionary soon, but until then I promised myself I would try my best to get through to people and awaken them from their long sleep. So I try all kinds of tactics and tried to take advantage of technology. I have debates on Y!A, broadcasted youtube videos, and even advertise my Christian beliefs on a myspace page.      Is any of this really helping anyone? Or do I have to wait until I'm old enough to start my mission before I can really save people?

According to the bible, on the 6th day, god created man and woman. And the man named all of the animals, and that is why they are called what they are.      According to science, humans weren't around for a loooong time.   Also, we (presently) have named all of the animals.         So which do I believe?

Ok, so I have been studying and reading about the Wiccan religion for about two years now. I understand what the beliefs are and all of that. The only thing that I can't remember off the top of my head are when and what the holidays are and what for. All I can remember is Samhain. But that's not my question, I want to know if based on how long I have been studying it and everything, if I am ready to perform the self dedication ritual. I will be a solitary witch for now at least unless I find a group somewhere when I'm older. But am I ready? Thanks!

20090219123002AA4ZhNq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, what do you have to say about these CONTRADICTIONS in the Bible?	The Bible is RIDDLED with contradictions.       I DECLARE THAT THE BIBLE IS 100% NOT THE WORD OF GOD AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS COMPLETELY FALSE.      Here are some examples of contradictions. No Christian has the stomach to challenge these as these are SO SO SERIOUS. I would seriously question my faith if i were Christian. These are soul destroying contradictions. I quote only 3:      II Kings 8:26   Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.      II Chronicles 22:2   Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.       CONTRADICTION!!!      II Kings 24:8   Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became King and he reigned three months in Jerusalem      II Chronicles 36:9   Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem.       CONTRADICTION!!!      II Samuel 24:9   And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people of the King: in Israel there were eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand.      I Chronicles 21:5   And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and in Judah four hundred and seventy thousand who drew the sword.       CONTRADICTION!!!      These are only THREE contradictions. There are many many many many many many MANY more in the Bible. What do you Christians have to say about that????? The Bible is NOT and I mean NOT the word of God. It is the word of man, and Christians will enter hell for their stupidity in still believing when it is blatantly obvious that the religion is a forgery. No flamings posts please. Thanks in advance.
