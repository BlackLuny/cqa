20090219205104AAi84jC	Pets;Dogs	In your Opinion: Are all "designer dogs" bad?	Read me out before you raise hell about irresponsible breeders and such. If a designer breeder breeds to the same standards i.e. not every cycle, properly vets, even breeds pups to parents/grandparents, etc. I do acknowledge their maybe more issues of genetic health issues or temperment problems, but that can also happen in purebreds lines. As I see it... Some pet lovers are allergic to dogs because of dander, so why not let them have the chance of a pet as well? Now poodles are known for not shedding and being well tempered for the most part, which is why most people choose them to breed to other breeds. So why go on a rant raving bashing on designer dogs if not ALL cases are bad? (NO LECTURING BULLSHIT ANSWERS)

20090219205156AAc0yR3	Pets;Dogs	Dogs stomach NOT abdomen bloated.  Whats wrong?	Her stomach is bloated right under her ribs, she seems a little more distended then normal.   There is no discoloration, so no internal bleeding.   She is acting normally.   She went to the vet last week, he told me that the bacteria already in her stomach was acting up and they were all together creating this belly bulge.  So I don't know what is causing it now.   She has taken all of her medication, and was doing well.  Then tonight I noticed it again.  Her belly is bulging in the same place.      She is farting and SUPER burpy, and is eating and drinking normally.  She is acting normally.   She does not get much exercise, she stays in most of the time.  I admit I don't walk my dogs as much as I should, and I noticed this more when I started feeding her dog chow again... I assume though it is not PURELY the dog chow causing it...   She is about 1 year old   Any suggestions?

20090219210221AAQrXFP	Pets;Horses	Pregnant mare! PLEASE HELP =)?	Hi i need a little help to relax me. My mare is 9 1/2- 10 months pregnant. she has good weight and eats good but i dont think she is big enough for as far as she is. she is 15.2 and so is the dad. she is appendix and he is a paint. you can see her belly on both sides if you stand in front of her but not if you stand behind her. I know she is that far along because i own both mare and stud. she was checked in the very beginning and she wasnt but she really was it was just to early at the time to tell. i had bred her before and put her on pasture and feed 1 time a day, and she lost weight so i brought her home. To put weight back on her.and i  put her back in with him. then moved them to a new barn and had her checked vet said no she wasn't. the date was 4-28-08 was the last time they were together and she was tested on may 12. the is a 18 day grace period they cant tell. So when i got her health cert done when i was moving out of state i thought she had been getting bigger so i had her checked and sure enough she was that was 12/15/08. So they say she is due 3/28--4/4. Its her first as far as i know of her teats are still small.      i have owned horses but never had a pregnant mare till her due date so this is new.   I have looked up pictures and she is small compared to most mares.    She is still pregnant because i can feel the baby moving

I have one male cockatiel which I have had for 7 years ( he is 7 years old ) and he loves humans (especially me ) . A few years back, I tried to intruduce him to another cockatiel. I had later found out that the new cockatiel was a girl ( which I didn't plan on ) and she was very dominent and bit people. I had to return her. ( Don't worry she got a good home later on. ) It was sad for me to do but I know it was the right thing to do considering my male 'tiel didn't like her very much. It has been a year since he has seen another cockatiel, but I am interested in getting another male. Do you think this is a good idea? How can I intruduce them properly and have them get along with each other? WILL THIS EFFECT THE WAY THE COCKATIEL I CURRENTLY OWN LOVES ME??????
20090219213458AAUhsYZ	Pets;Cats	Neighbors are threatening to call Animal Control on my cat?	We just moved here a few months ago. The neighbors are all about 10 years older than us and really snotty. Every one of them is super nosy, and they really don't like us. I've made friends with one person, who lives in a different building. Since the others in our building, and their building, have noticed him coming over, they make smart comments to him about it... I know, how mature, right? Anyways--we have a 2 year old, spayed female, declawed friendly cat. Lately she has been getting out of the house. She comes back so I've just been letting her go. I know that sometimes she cries at our door but it's never for too long before I let her back in. She is in no way neglected or abused.. inside she has a litter box, food dish and toys. I even brush her for God's sake. Anyways, today my friend told me the neighbors next to us were threatening to call animal control on our "poor cat" who keeps getting left outside. The cat runs outside.. she likes to be outside. She's declawed and I'm pretty sure as a cat usually does she just minds her own business. So why are they doing this? I didn't call animal control when their two huge loud dogs dug such a huge hole underneath the fence inbetween our backyards they could fit underneath it. They didn't even fill it in--my husband waited a week before he just put cinder blocks in the hole.    So what is the deal? I feel like this is ridiculous and frankly I want to approach both of them tomorrow. Say they call animal control, what will they do? I mean the cat is obviously well taken care of and does not climb on cars or tear up things. They just see her outside the door and apparently it really bothers them...

I really wanna find out because they seem like a good bird, but I want to be sure of their personality before I commit to anything.

I may get a bigger one someday, but for now this is all I can get.    I've been doing some reading, but I'd like to know of what I should be careful of, look out for, etc. when cycling the tank.      I have three fish right now. Two fantail goldfish, (Toshiba and Se?or Pescado) and one feeder goldfish (Samsung).    When I get the new tank, should I put them all in to go through the cycle all at once? Or would this result in one of them dying? Because I dearly love these goldfish even though Se?or Pescado is only a month old, and the other two are only about a week.   Would putting them all in at once be dangerous for them?   What can I do to prevent as much danger and stress to them as I possibly can?   Are there any other tips that I should know about cycling a tank?

20090219221630AACK2if	Pets;Dogs	My dog likes to pee on furniture!!?	Ok, so.....here's the deal we have a almost 2 year old English Bulldog who is fixed. For about 2 years now he seems that he thinks he can just jump up on the bed or couch and pee...it's not marking his territory cuz he pee's a big puddle. No new baby we had a baby and got him around the same time so it's not that, got a new puppy a year ago that's not it. I personally think he's just LAZY! Recently let's say earlier this week he just looked at my husband and I and squated right on our bed and peed! Then tonight I happen to fall asleep on the couch with him on my lap only to wake up fricken sweatin..so I thought! I noticed he peed right on the blankets that were on me and it went right onto the couch!! So, again not a marking issue...(I don't think) what is his problem? I am at a loss here our other dog does not pee on furniture! He sleeps in a kennel at night (due to this reason) We would like our dogs to not sleep in kennels at night but at this point he doesn't have a choice! I don't think it's cuz he has to go outside, I put both dogs out often throughout the day right away in the morning, right away after they eat (they stay out there for about a half hour) even when they come in and drink water they go back out after a few minutes of drinking water. If anyone can give me any ideas that would be helpful!

Now, I will probably have to have another surgey done. He did say the vet will take care of the charges . meand my wife where very clear on what to do. I get home and 3 hours later he starts going nuts scratching his eyes and running around like crazy, the eye looks worse now than before. Now I have to have another surgery done. Should I get a lawyer?

20071112180027AASYRWW	Pets;Dogs	I rescued a new puppy from the pound today..?	And was wondering about it's breed. It was simply registered as a "Pit Bull Mix" However, most often the breed on paper is just a guess.      So.. i believe it is pitbull, because it definately looks like one, however it's fluffier, and very large (It's 6 weeks old).      As far as coloring it's Tan with a small black saddle on its back. Because of this I was thinking it might be a Shepherd, of some kind.. Hmmm. Unfortunately, no pictures of it atm.

20080504083253AAKLjP9	Pets;Dogs	Parvo Puppies!!!?	I have some American Bulldog puppies who have parvo. They had already had their shots before they got it but they still managed to get it. We took them to the vet to get treated but the vet said that it would be a waste of money because it really depends on them. He said if we get them to eat and they fight back, then they will live. The only problem is that we cant get them to eat. We've tried dry dog food, can dog food, we've put puppy weaning milk in a syreige (without the neddle) and squirt in their mouths but they just throwed it back up. We've even tried small pieces of bacon, bologna, and turkey. How can we get them to eat and drink before its too late for the ones that are left????? HELP PLEASE

I bought him about 3 years ago, i tried him out before i bought him at the previous owners house, he would turn very easily, and stop. But now, he often fights his bit in certain places in our pasture. I don't do anything but western pleasure, usually just riding in our pasture or the neighbors arena. I decided to try out another bit on him, which is a Tom Thumb. Is this the right choice or should i go and buy a different type of bit?

I have a 1 1/2 yr Quarter Horse buckskin filly, I am wondering if anyone knows what I can feed her that will make her coat healthy and help her mane and tail grow. I am mainly conserned about getting her mane to grow more so then her tail because her mane was roached (well the man tried and did a horrible job) the day before I got her. I wish the man would have left it long but I think it was tangled and matted by the looks of her forelock and tail when I got her. Thank you so much in advance!!

20081019163238AAJDR8G	Pets;Dogs	Our five week old pup isn't eating.?	We, just yesterday, went to look at a litter of 1/2 Siberian Husky pups. They are only five weeks old, but they were quite large, active, chubby, and we were told they were weaned and started on solid food already. The mom was there at the farm.   Convinced, we take one home. Soon after, we realised that she doesn't accept food, except small pieces of bacon and a small amount of our cat's food. Worried, we called a help line, and they told us to make a formula and feed it to her. She has a hard time eating that as well, and she even has thrown up a couple of times. We know this pup has worms and fleas (she's going to the vet tomorrow). What can we do to convince her to eat? I have gotten some wet food and treats as well. No luck.

20081019163755AAUQe1W	Pets;Dogs	What should i use on my puppy for fleas? ?	I just turned 16 and I need to know what i can use for my 8 month lab/retriever puppy. i've had her since she was 4 months old and i love her so much. i'm using the rest of my birthday money to try and get her fleas (which we recently discovered) under control again. i used the hartz flea shampoo in the meanwhile and used the hair drier to dry her. people say they don't work but i think it has helped her a little. i read that company is bad for animals though. i won't use their flea drops again but should i not use the flea shampoo then? can i use water with dish soap (which i read helps drown the fleas?)      also should i use revolution, frontline plus, interceptor, or heartguard? she was going to the vet for them every month but she hasn't been in for like 2 months now. since she was a puppy she didn't need to be tested. does she have to now since she didn't have those 2 months of treatment? also what can i do to help with the flea problem in the house and the yard? be specific if you can please. i can't get a job because my parents want me to focus on school. i want to get the fleas under control now so i don't have to spend this much all the time.      helpful answers please! :]

20090219163650AAnWDPI	Pets;Horses	This is what I have added!:)?	Please help me perfect it:)      Ears perked up vertically, ready for anything, the ears covered in a golden chestnut. Her flaxen forelock extends near her eyes, soft and as smooth as silk, hanging freely." White off balances her face. One side of the white curves around her eye like it’s a perfect fit. The other side expands out to the end of the face. The outside of the face is sorrel, continuing the ongoing color of her body. The white on her face is stained with dirt and manure. Next to her muzzle is a small chestnut mark. Nostrils are light pink and gray/brown underneath. Her muzzle is covered in unneeded whiskers. Eyes relaxed and calm with a soft gentle feeling. One eye is filled with fog while the other is perfectly clear. Her dark chocolate brown eyes produce innocence in her face. Sticking my fingers in her mouth feeling the bumpy texture of her teeth with my thumbs. Her teeth are big and raised high.     Her neck is long and wide, chestnut all around except for a splash of dirty white like pond in the middle of a desert. The white shaped like a painter spilled a bucket of paint over a ledge and it splattered aimlessly that makes her unique. Abbi’s flaxen mane hanging about half way down from the crest. The middle of her mane for about four inches across hangs short stubs of new hair trying to grow. Her mane is soft and tangle free. Abbi’s mane feels like a baby blanket. Mane is in big loose braids with dark brown rubber bands to keep them from falling out.    Stomach and back raided by sorrel except on the bottom of the barrel. A big white splatter storms over the chestnut and extends under her belly. The blob looks like a cloud in a clear blue sky, no clouds day. Moving down the front legs sorrel has covered. Hooves a dirty black with pink/gray vertical lines extending downwards. Glancing at the back legs you see that they are more colored. One leg has a long dirty white stocking while the other has a short filthy white sock.      The back and butt are chestnut. Back like a valley, butt like a hill. Moving down to the dock, a gleaming flaxen tail is French braided and wrapped in a royal purple tail bag with two neat small stretchy purple strings tied into the braid near the top to keep it from falling out.

He goes to doggy daycare while we are at  work and always seems to enjoy playing with the other dogs. He does suffer from separation anxiety if we leave him home alone. Today I picked him up after work and we had to run errands so my husband tried to pick him up to gate him in the kitchen and he growled and really snarled and nearly bit his hand! He never has the behavior so I am not sure if it is the separation anxiety since he saw me putting my coat on or if something happened at the daycare today. Any suggestions?

20090219165635AAVldOp	Pets;Dogs	My dog needs to go on a diet?	My dog is about 15-20 pounds overweight... I was in shock. I just got home, last time i saw her she was about 10 pounds over weight (i was away at college). My mom agreed that she needs to go on a diet. I am on a diet right now. And plan to go on runs with her though out the day. But she really does not want to run. She goes on long walks already, but i figure i bring her on my runs with me. But what are some other ways to get her on this diet. My brothers won't follow it to much. They will still give her food. And no matter what i say, i can't control them (my brothers are 17, and 18) and think its ok, and cute to give her human food. So i figured if we start to give her less human food (about half then what she is having now, maybe it will help. She is 5 years old. And i don't want to see her go early, because she is my best friend, my hero (she literary saved my life once). And a awesome Girl=) What can i do for her?

20090219180159AAIkeKX	Pets;Dogs	Introducing a puppy to an Older Family Dog?	I've just introduced a six week old puppy to my 10 year old dog.  They seemed to be getting on great, and in hindsight I've probably made a few mistakes, like they sleep in the same room (in different beds) and share the back yard during the day (could be that the pup is pestering the older dog).  My older dog this week has started urinating inside during the night.  I'm thinking its an attention seeking measure, but I'm unsure as to how to stop her doing it?  Any help would be appreciated.

20090203112539AAoWstW	Pets;Rodents	What should I do about my boss?	I am a volunteer on a children's farm. The farm has 14 rabbits which I am often asked to feed and clean out. I do not mind at all feeding them and cleaning them out, as the boss tells my I am the or one of the best people on that job, and he says he knows they are going to get done properly with me.     He often explains to me that other workers do not other volunteers and other works leave the pooh corners in. That means by Friday when I go in I have a lot of work to do which is fine because it keeps my busy. But last week I was not given the rabbits on Friday. I was of Saturday. They where in a bad state on Sunday. They also had no hay. I was asked to put in some hay. I was also asked to sweep the staffroom and clean the cat bowls. That meant that I did not have time to do the rabbits properly or as well as I would have liked.    Two of the rabbits needed a full clean out and I did not get time to do that.    Also I would have been early on a friday if I did not have to go the dentist for a check up.    What can I do to make sure the boss does not give me too much to do so that I can give these rabbits the care they need?

I recently got 2 dwarf hamsters that im 99% sure are both female. as it turns out one of them was already pregnant when i got her from the pet store so now we have babies !!!! there are only 2 babies and the two adult hams seem to both be taking care of them (i dont know for sure which hamster is the mother). The babies both seem to be healthy, they are growing very quickly ,and are at least 2 weeks old .    1. is there a need to separate any of the hams for their safety? (i'm not worried about more breeding just yet room and care are not an issue)    2.Given the age of the babies do i still need to worry about the adults eating them?    3.recently the adults have been taking the babies out of the nest and running around while carrying them. Is this normal? if so what are they doing? if not should i be concerned?     4.when exactly can i hold the babies?     5.Is it not recomended for me to take the adults out of the cage for short periods of time? i just got them recently and this whole baby thing is kind of a set back in getting the adults used to me.

I asked a question a day or two ago asking how I can get my very reluctant dog to eat dry food and most of the answers I got back were very helpful. Anyway, I finally did it, mixing the biscuits in with wet food, a bit of gravy, a few leftover pieces of black pudding, a tiny tiny bit bit of grated cheese (won't be given every time) and a small scraping of dairy-free sunflower spread. I heard him gulping away at if for about 10 minutes. :D      Anyway, just to make this a question, do you agree with what I have just given him?

20090203110318AAr6Tzr	Pets;Dogs	Why is my dog limping?	i have a two year old blue heeler/rhodesian ridgeback mix.    she is 52 pounds of solid muscle.     we noticed that she would start to limp on her back leg when she was about one year old and had been playing at the dog park for an especially long time. she didn't act like she was in pain and kept on playing so i just thought she had to poop and it was making her run funny (she does that sometimes).   she only starts to limp when she has worked or played for a very long time.   i recently started walking her with a weighted backpack. i only had four pounds total in the pack, and after 2 miles on the walk (well she was running the whole time) she would resist bending her back leg, but still was running, jumping, and having a good old time. it made me realize that all these times she was running funny at the dog park she was actually limping!   she recently got hit by 2 cars at the same time. she had x-rays and was examined several times. the vets found absolutely nothing wrong with her, including nothing wrong with her limping leg.     the limp started before she got hit and i never mentioned it to the vet because i didn't realize she had been limping this whole time until recently on these walks!      what could cause my dog to limp that a vet would not notice in a thorough inspection of my dog?

20090203105802AAZVBxW	Pets;Dogs	Dog fight at my Home residence?	a yellow lab and about a month ago the dog got out and got into a fight with a neighbors dog in the middle of the street. This fight sprawled over into the neighbors yard where the fight was then broken up. The neighbors dog had a small cut in its chest and they took the dog to the most expensive "surgeon" in northern nevada. We offered to pay a part of the bill. The bill we received was an unconceivable $800 dollars. The vet reduced the bill to $390, which we paid half of or $189.00. The neighbor became irate that we had not paid the whole bill, after berating me and my wife on the phone, which ended up with me telling her that was all we were going to pay and if she wanted to discuss this anymore to contact our attorney or take us to small claims court, she hung up. Then I was notified she filed a police report, and subsequently sent me an letter saying she had consulted an attorney and would be taking me to small claims court if we did not pay the remaining balance. My question is, why should I have to pay the whole balance on a dog fight that started in the middle of street and with both dogs off their leashes and off their respective properties? Should I just let her take me to court? Do I have a good case?

20090219205842AACXIfZ	Pets;Cats	What is the best way to discipline cats?	I have a wonderful, playful kitty. However, she definitely occasionally indulges in a little mischief. Examples would be her knocking over the trash can and playing with it until it is all over the floor while I am away, chewing on plants, jumping onto the kitchen counters and knocking things over, etc. Now I do realize that cats have minds of their own. So my question is: should I just do a better job of kitty-proofing my house, or is there any method of discipline (spray bottle and shouting "Hey" work at the time, but doesn't keep her from doing those things again)? Of course, I would never do anything that hurts my kitty and I don't want anyone to think that I don't love her, just wanted your wisdom :)
20090203111048AAahybM	Pets;Dogs	What will happen to my dog?	I have a one year old Lab/German shephard mix.  I took him to the vet this morning because he has been constipated and hasn't been able to go #2 for almost 2 days now.  They did x-rays and said that can't see what is blocking his colon because his colon is so full.  They said they are pretty sure there is something in there blocking it becasue he would be passing stool by now.  So what happens is he needs these procedures and we don't have the money to pay for them.  They already said they do not offer payment plans either, payments need to be made up front.  So i am just wondering what happens if the owner can not afford the procedures.

I have a 6month old cat that I fell in love from the shelter (not neutered) he is very cuddly when he is sleeping, but when he goes into hyper-mode he will come sneak up on me attack my arm, legs, feet, hands, until to the point I bleed. I have over 10 cuts from him. Also he does not do this to any one else except me, and i am the one that feed him and take care of him. I punish him by putting him in his cage or spraying water on him. HELP because I have to give him back to the shelter if it does not stop.

20090219203053AAYBT8q	Pets;Other - Pets	How does one properly pick up a gerbil? And other random gerbil questions... 5 points for the best answer?	Okay.. so I've had my little guy for... well.. I can't exactly remember... Definitely over a year. Not more than two years I think.      When I got him, he was already old. I felt so bad when I looked at him all sad looking in the corner. At the pet store he was all alone because he was older than all the other ones. And no one wanted him cuz you know how everyone just goes crazy over the babies! hahaha. I don't know how old a gerbil has to be in order to be considered an adult. When the pet store lady took him out of him cage, she picked him up by his tail only after chasing him around and put him in a cardboard box. I took him home. (:      Since I saw the lady at the pet store pick up my gerbil this way, I always assumed it's the right way. I was mortified, absolutely mortified to discover just recently that this is not the proper way! How does one properly pick up a gerbil?      Because I got my gerbil when he was an adult.. he doesn't really enjoy human contact. He will occassionally let me pet his head for a few seconds then the little ball of energy just runs away. Is it neccessary for gerbils to have human contact like guinea pigs and rabbits? Will putting him in his little play-rolling-ball type thing outside his cage help him become more social?      My mom used to breed gerbils when she was in her 20s, and our family is full of pet-lovers so he's properly cared for. He has about.. hmm.. I want to say a 15 gallon.. possibly even 20 gallon tank to run around in. I got the cage from a woman who had previously had some hamsters. The wheel is attached and hangs from the cover if that makes sense.. so he can go under the wheel as well. He has a small food dish, and a small wooden house about 4in. by 4in. Does he have enough room to run around? I put lots of bedding for him to burrow in, he always throws it to one side of the cage and makes little tunnels. hahaha.      Thank you so much for taking your time to read and answer my question!!!

Her normal weight is 35lbs, she is very petite.  As a puppy we had to start cooking up ground beef and rice to mix with her kibble to entice her to eat.  It worked well for the last 3 1/2 years, but about 2 months ago she pretty well stopped eating all together.  Just picks here and there.  I took her to the vet and as of a week ago she is weighing in at 28lbs.  They did blood work and took a urine sample and have ruled out liver or kidney problems.  Today we go back because she seems to be getting worse.  Next they will look into stomach and intestinal issues.  I'm starting to get very worried.  I just want her to eat!  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

20090219223018AAHQOKm	Pets;Cats	My cat has been sneezing all day, does she have a cold?	I think I will take her to the vet tomorrow if she is still sneezing.  She doesn't seem herself and I think she is sick.
20090219223801AAOoWws	Pets;Cats	What could these symptoms mean for a cat?	My sister-in-law has a two year old female cat. A few days ago I noticed that the cat was looking very thin, was hiding away from where my nieces could get to her (very unusual since she loves the children), and was curled in a very protective position. When I looked at her she had blood and orange mucus dripping from her mouth and she smelled awful (like infection and blood).       I've worked in animal clinics before but I've never seen anything like this. I asked my sister-in-law about it and she said that the cat had been acting strange for a few days. I asked her if she'd taken her to the vet and she said she couldn't afford it since she's being laid off from work at the end of the month and they've already started cutting back hours. I talked it over with my boyfriend and we agreed that when he gets paid tomorrow I'd take the cat in to the vet (we got my sister-in-law's permission as well).      Tonight she called to say the cat was getting worse and hasn't eaten. She tries to eat, but seems too weak to chew even soft food. She also said that when the cat tries to scratch her face it seems to hurt her. I have to wait for my boyfriend to pick his check up tomorrow and deposit it before I can take the cat to the vet. Any ideas as to what this could be? I've never seen anything like it.
