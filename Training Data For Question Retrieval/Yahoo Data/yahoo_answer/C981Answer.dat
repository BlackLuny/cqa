0HO8sTGeaa	YOU SU**|`|L1QTSErIaa	It's not only Man United. Even Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal look weak and vulnerable against the big clubs. On face value, it would seem these clubs are dominating the English teams.   But that is not the case. The English play a quick high tempo game. Most times, they get the ball and play it quick enough to create a chance. Meaning their possession of the ball is lesser.   Unlike the other European clubs. Big clubs from Italy and Spain play 'keep ball'. And try to make full use the pitch. You can see these clubs spray the ball from left to right more often without making a quick chance at goal. So it would seem they have more possession of the ball and dominating the game.   But this only suits the English game. They prefer the opponents to have all the possession. Because the English clubs defend well.|`|huto12P3aa	Yea i agree with you actually, it makes the premier league look a weak league. I dont really understand to be honest. i think the spanish and italian teams are just stronger when playing english teams. But its only Real madrid and Barca who could beat the man utds and Chelseas, and its probably only Inter these days that could beat the man utds and chelseas, possibly Juve too|`|PYiQGwsAaa	Barca all over united last season, remind me what was the result|`|bGuVAltxaa	How can they be weak against them when they are European champions? The injuries where the main reason they lost against Milan a few years back and even though Barca did have most of the possession last year, Utd did win the game, and if Ronaldo had put that penalty away in the 1st leg at the Nou Camp, there's no way the tie would have been that close. Just remember that nearly every year for the last 2 or 3 years, english clubs have made up 3 of the 4 semi-finalists in the champions league.|`|A4W6YLS0aa	Man Utd 4-3 Real Madrid. That was one of the best games ever. Ronaldo played excellent. They seem to play crap aginst big Europena teams. Like when they lost to Milan 1-0 twice and then 3-0. also they did just about get past barca last season. But Man United are not a weak team.|`|gKHoI9Xgaa	When United played Milan they had injuries to the defense. Vidic and Ferdinand where both out for the first leg so that clown Heinze was playing.    For the Barcelona game It shows how strong the defense is if the likes of Xavi,iniesta, Messi, Eto'o and co can't break down your defense over 2 legs.    You can't be weak againt the big teams and win the Premiership and Champions league in 1 season.|`|UUT4rj3zaa	there weak anywhere!  i h8 them!!!  am a Chelsea by da waii!|`|gPsFFQbRaa	no they r gud.|`|Hda1ic24aa	yes no maybe so

KNTofuxMaa	I'm not making any excuse bout the Utah game. Bama just didn't show up to play in that game. Bottom Line.The recruiting went well this year, though. Saban is proving his recruiting expertise. So far, the 4 mil has been worth it! Everybody is going to get a big dose of Bama football for the next few years so, y'all get ready, now, ya hear?     Roll Tide!!|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Since you seem to like links so much, try this one.    http://fullysports.com/football/2008/pol...    I save my real trash talking for nOU pukes.    45-35  Enough Said!

And what happened the last time SC palyed Texas in that home bowl game?|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	What was the question?|`|iXz80uW9aa	8-0 in SEC play .....  hmmm ... did the Gators move ????|`|nqdDe3cJaa	saying Bama didnt show up IS making an excuse for the Utah game.  Utah was the better team, period.  it was not a lucky play that turned the tide (no pun intended) .... Utah pretty much dominated that game from start to finish.    Utah was the better team, deal with it.      if BYU won the 1984 national championship because they were the "only undefeated team" .... then by all means Utah should have been named national champions last season.  in 1984 .... BYU played absolutely NOBODY, their best victory was against 6-6 Michigan in the Holiday Bowl, and they needed a last minute TD drive to win that game.  Utah at least beat some legitimate football teams.  Alabama, Oregon St, BYU.      Orange .... spare me your "Hook em" crap.  the Fraud 12 was exposed during the bowl games .... enough said.  lol @ needing 59 minutes and 42 seconds to beat Ohio St.  haha.  USC had them beat before halftime.  enough said.  but keep bragging about that 10 point victory over the Fraud 12 champion that has quite the reputation around college football as being choke artists.  HUGE win.  haha.    FRAUD 12 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|49vSwNJHaa	First of all I would like to Apologize to all the people that I gave too blunt of my thoughts. With that being said I will answer tactfully. Congratulations to Alabama for a wonderful season, not the last 2-games. I think you were burnt out! Not making any excuses but this happens. You were almost as bad at quarterback as any team in the SEC. Lucky to beat LSU and OLE Miss. But a win is a win, somewhere along the line a red flag should have sounded: therefore it didn't. Sometimes Great Seasons just turn in to good seasons. Keep up the good work. They also picked Ohio State to Beat LSU. Opinions don't count by commentators it is decided on the field . See how well LSU and Alabama recruited when nobody Sabotaged LSU, by saying their coach was leaving? Best of Luck next year good recruiting. Hope you come in 2nd in the West to LSI HA!HA!|`|BzctzIcgaa	If your right, then why ask the question?|`|v3Xbsktdaa	You lost me at Saban...how can you seriously rely on a coach like him?

My first ski gloves were cheap and I bought a new pair on my first day skiing!  Snow and Rock have got a good range.  You need to be looking at spending more than 15 though!  Get the best you can afford.    I have a pair of Spyder gloves which were about 60 and they have been fine skiing in Europe, but in America over Christmas it was that cold I ended up buying a pair of mittens for over 100!  Ouch!    Do some more research and compare brands a little.  Just remember - Goretex!|`|OMEDzf3maa	Any gloves that will keep your hands dry & warm.. although my favourite make is Spyder|`|q1b7170caa	warm ones
xK2IMLPLaa	Well everyone has their talents and in my opinion your talents give you an advantage to people who don't have those talents.  It's the same thing as in music and academics as in sports.  You may not be particulary talented at something but that doesn't mean you can't reach the same skill level as someone who does have talent, you just have to work harder and be dedicated.    So yes, I do agree with you.|`|VD0wriflaa	Yes, I very much agree with you. You have to work hard to become a good footballer, I don't think any one is born with talent.|`|gKHoI9Xgaa	Your not born with talent. You put in alot of work to become a talented footballer.|`|8xQDRRZfaa	Sorry it doesn't quite work like that. You still have to meet the basic elite level standard to be a pro. It doesn't mean you have to be like Ronaldo but you at least have to be at the "pro class". That means you have to be talented to some degree.    If ALL it took was practice then everyone would be professional soccer players. People practice their whole lives, hours each day and still get no where.    The truth is practice just brings out your full potential. Now if two people go up against each other and trained their hardest, the person with more talent will win. That said most people DON'T train their hardest so if you are one of the people that do, you will have a great advantage and may be able to beat players you shouldn't be able to beat naturally.|`|6y9Bqok9aa	theres no way of being born "naturally talented" you must earn what you get, it is not given
nqdDe3cJaa	Tim Tebow isnt in the top 100 college players of all time.  he will never take a snap under center in the NFL.  its seems to me that to most of the people who answer these types of questions .... "all time" means the last 5 years.    does ANYBODY on this site have a clue about the history of college football ???? my goodness !!!!!!!  Charles White, Barry Sanders, LaDanian Tomlinson, Archie Griffin, Marcus Allen, Billy Simms, Tommy Frazier, Ronnie Lott, Kenny Easley, Earl Campbell, Tim Brown ..... seriously .... i could spend the next 30 minutes rolling off names who had better college careers than Tebow.    Marcus Allen holds the NCAA record with eight consecutive 200 (thats TWO hundred) yard games.  oh ... my bad.  most of you children probably dont even know who Allen is, might think he is a QB.  he was a RB, thats 200 yards RUSHING, for eight straight games.  please .... please ..... tell me what individual stats does Tebow have that compares to that ???? while youre at it ..... Barry Sanders 37 rushing TDs and 2800 rushing yards in a single season.  Tebow is nothing compared to the all time greats.  heck, he isnt even close to being the best player in the University of Florida's history.  i would not put him in the Florida top 15.  they had some bum that played there a while back, but since it was more than 5 years ago most of you never heard of him.  his name is Emmitt Smith.  Google him sometime, you might learn something.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	NO not now Not ever!|`|fHxpycJSaa	No, St. Tebow is not the best, greatest or anything like that. He doesn't walk on water, change water into wine, or feed the masses on a loaf of bread and a couple of fish.|`|KNTofuxMaa	College.... Maybe    The NFL... he hasn't even played a down. Has he ever even stood under center?|`|AA10130483	Nope... He's the next Ryan Leaf...|`|jwm0kQvNaa	it's hard to tell, since he hasn't played a down in the NFL yet, and won't until 2010.    He IS in the Top Three all-time NCAA players, however.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	To the people saying if Tim Tebow produces another NC, and another Heisman that he will be the best college football player of all time I beg to differ.    By that logic Archie Griffin is the current best college football player of all time, I've never heard anyone suggest that before.    There are a whole lot of players with multiple NC in college. NC are more a product of the team than the individual. (Tommy Frazier, Lawrence Phillips)    Tim Tibow's name will go right up their among the greatest players in college ball history, but I find it hard to compare people at different positions. I also don't consider Tebow even the best college QB of all time, and stats wise he isn't.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	better than your spelling.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	If he wins another national championship next year, then yes he will arguably be considered the greatest college athlete of all time. However, I don't think he will ever amount to much in the NFL.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	he could be the best college player ever.  Id wait till next year an see what happens. I mean if he wins the Heisman, he is definetly in the discussion.  He is a class act of a person also.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yu are kidding ,yes? he has to get to the nfl,then prove he can start at his position. i think he will prove out to have been a very talented college player but the nfl will prove to be a much different playing field for him.|`|J3kfQtViaa	In reference to my favorite sports announcer, frank gifford, who's most insightful and deepest commentary was...    He's a good one!      p.s. - he just called him St. tebow, no you did not sir lol|`|o9DZledyaa	He is one of the best college football players in the history of the game. The JUry is still out on the nfl|`|Roes9U61aa	Hell No|`|m4yyCDNCaa	I'd like to know your logic behind a kid still in college being the greatest player in the NFL.       Bambam: I think his total under center this season was a whopping 2 times.|`|BzctzIcgaa	No, and after seeing so many questions from people like you, it is up to you to decide. HE isn't, there have been plenty of better players.|`|KRf30XAHaa	he is not the best player, if he matched up with the players today the bigger stronger and faster overall he sucks|`|vwTu8fY7aa	No how can you compare him to Tom Brady or Peyton Manning   Players that come from college tend to realize that the NFL is a much harder league with much better teams  These players are the elite individuals who have something special. Maybe in college, but the NFL is a whole different story.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	College QB's = Tommy Fraiser-Neb  Pro QB''s = Joe Montana-49er's    Tim is not in a serious conversation for either unless he WINS another national title...which would be the pentacle of his career in football.  As for Pro QB's he will never be in the discussion.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	No. Only to people with very short memories.    He's good, but come on. The best ever?    Why does everything have to be a superlative? Why can't people just appreciate a good player and leave it at that?|`|6iuZEUhzaa	he never played nfl  and he wasnt even great in college. sam bradford is better then him  he's gonna suck ballszsz in the NFL.|`|ELwysDcVaa	great college player though sam brad could giv him a run for his money should he take his team to another bowl and actually WIN.....|`|NLj70oJIaa	Tea Bag TeBow!|`|tVEm2eJXaa	If Tim Tebow wins a Heisman and a National Championship in 2009 then he will hands down be the greatest college football player of all time. As for being the best in NFL history, we'll just need to wait and see.|`|6J5mQWj0aa	he is a great person and a great player but to be called the greatest not yet it some other players that should be in that bowl and im a gators fan|`|d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	Are you applying for a job as a Fox announcer?

As a whole ninjitsu compromises of 18 disciplines, including a few unassociated with fighting, such as geography and meteorology (chi mon) although in terms of modern ninjitsu you would most probably find only these: Taijitsu (unarmed), Kenjutsu (sword), Bojutsu (stick & staff)    I hope I've helped you|`|iXz80uW9aa	For a street fight ?

The term Martial is derived for the word Militia(latin term) which means the Military way. Today Martial Arts was defined in 1933 by Websters Diictionary as a sportcompetetive form of fighting like Judo. However, the actual term Marital Arts in todalayman'smens term acceptedpted by most Asian Schools is a way of life and a system that has survived the age of modern militweaponsonsl . All Martial Arts have been through vast changes based on society and the times. Schools from Japan, China, Korea, ThailaPhilippinesines, Indonesia, Okinawa, and India are old ways of life that hsurvivedvied the test of time and have existed all this time for a reason. In battle thwarriorsrars have been able to keep thTraditionsions alive from the actual fighting with old style weapons or I should say bladed weapons and no weapons at all. Western Boxing and Wrestling are also original schools from the West that were practiced in combat by the Greeks and Romans. Some schools have kept Traditionalosidesdie teaching only to students appreciateiate the art. Other schools have modified to teach their arts as a sport. So these schools are all the real deal. What happens is Comptoirtior and how he or she trains in the art form. along with his or her master.     As for a real marital arts praticed in the modern world to acutal make a difference. Our US Soilders in the Infantry, SF, and Rangers, Navy SEALS, US Marines, US Air Force are the new Martial Arts that is the real deal dealing with conflict over seas.|`|HO26GMWCaa	I've taken Shotokan Karate, Tae Kwon Doe, Dragon Karate, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and based on that Muay Thai is the most brutal and effective.|`|IaHBKA1saa	What do you mean by real deal?

Most any of them will do damage to an attacker, if properly executed.    Most "Offensive" martial arts refine basic strikes and kicks with speed and power practice, but there is only som many ways of hitting or kicking a person.  Continuous training provides improved speed and power, but the basics are available to the beginner very quickly.    I can't really speak to the "Real Deal", but there are a number of martial arts studios which do not teach the "Real Deal".  These are the martial arts for profit studios, where students are encouraged to progress up a very crowded belt ladder at a quick pace, regardless of ability, pay exhorbitant fees at every level attained.  I sometimes refer to these studios as "Buy-a-belt".  Attainment of a black belt in this environment does not necessarily signify that you have actually accomplished anything.    Martial arts which have maintained the integrity of the promotional system, and do not compromise standards of promotion for profit are the "Real Deal."  Doesn't matter what they're teaching, specifically.|`|73wpIlgnaa	um the traditional ones tha thave been used for centuries. hard core stuff right there|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Whichever one you feel fits you best.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	If you're just starting to train, start with a good mixed martial arts school.  It will teach you a good mix of techniques, and get you in great shape.      From there you might decide you like one aspect better than the reat.  For instance, you might like to grapple, but not to kick, or vise versa.  You can specialize from there.    It will also give you a fully functioning BS detector, and BS is rife in the martial arts world.  It will help you tell good schools from bad.|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Kock Wan Do, it's fo rurl!|`|LUnscegvaa	Whichever you feel comfortable with and can adapt to survival situations.

To become a complete fighter I would recommend training in multiple arts.  a good combination would be  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Grecco Roman Wrestling, and Judo...  it was believed for a long time that karate didn't work but Lyoto Machida has proven it to be very very useful when coupled with these other styles.

So throughout the evening, it came to about 500 $ US and I was making 10 an hour then, working in the shipping department for a software company (if Tony Chu reads this: If you need that computer to be sent to Taipei or Berlin, get it to me before 3:40pm, you know the UPS truck is gonna come at 4 on the dot! lol)    As if that wasn't bad enough, the Sharks won the game, and at least 5 of their drunken fans purposely dropped, or spilled, either alcohol, coke or food onto my jersey over the course of the evening.|`|brd6l4MAaa	$150 for a seat aboot three-quarters of the way to the top of the Wachovia Center.

So we didn't pay so much for the tickets... but I paid in other ways.    I paid $95 to see the Rangers lose to the caps in DC this past november.  :(.

AA10702710	Here's the deal....    The person that talks about the lock-out feature is correct.  If you don't put in the correct 6 digit number in 3 tries, it will give you a "time-out" of about 15 minutes before you can try again.    SOME safes have will reset to 123456 if you remove the battery and then replace it.  But the majority will not.    This is what you would really have to do.  Take a digital photo of the safe and the serial number tab.  Contact RedHead and explain your situation.  They may have you complete an avidavit that the safe belongs to you and you might also have to supply a proof of purchase.  RedHead will then go through their records and determine what the electronic combination is.  This would mean that you would have to remove the batteries and reinstall them, and then punch-in the combo that RedHead gives you.  Also, if you kept the original instructions for the safe, it should have the default combo with the instructions.  Again...you have to remove the battery first, then reinstall the battery and the electronic lock will reset to the factory digits.    I know this from experience.  I bought a safe from a retailer that was on sale as a clearance item.  It turns-out that they locked the paperwork inside the safe.  I agreed to purchase the safe and then contacted the manufacturer of the safe.  I provided them with complete proofs of purchase for the safe (including the serial number of the safe) and they were able to go through their records and find the correct electonic code to open it.|`|LWzrCu5caa	First,  read the instruction book.  If you do not have one,   check the internet.      There is no "secret" code because if there was,  any criminal would know it and be able to open the safe.   Not much security in that.    If you do not remember your password (combination) you might have to try every number possible.       Have fun.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Contact your area Locksmith.*|`|vea6mqPZaa	Those have a 15 minute lockout  if you enter the wrong code 3 times it locks you out for 15 minutes    Put a new battery in the touchpad    and start guessing the numbers.    If it is brand new and you did not set the password then it should be 123456 or the last 6 of the serial number or something to that effect    other than that, 150 dollar visit from a locksmith recommended by redhead|`|CFQbdDRNaa	call the manufacturer and see what they say,|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Yes every safe has a secret code.  It should be printed on the instructions/manual that came with the safe.    Electronic keypad entry safes' secret codes (combination) should be changed by the user.  The code you find in the instructions/manual will only work if it has not been changed to a different code combination.    For maximum protection the user must randomly pick their own code.  Leaving code set by factory allows the store, delivery, and factory employees easy access to your valuables.    The manufacturer may be able to supply the original factory set code.  If you've changed the code, it will no longer respond to the original factory code.  No locksmith will be able to magically open the safe.    I would never buy a safe that reset to 123456 after batteries are removed.  That is just stupid.  Every criminal in the land would know that trick.    I would never buy a safe that reset to the factory original code after battery removal.  That is beyond stupid.  Batteries always die and need replacement.    If the safe is empty call a recycler.  They should at least haul away the safe for free.    If the safe contains durable valuables you'll need a heavy sledge hammer, some long pry bars, and ear plugs to attack the door.    If the safe contains fragile valuables you need an industrial grade circular saw, ear plugs, and safety glasses to attack the side.|`|SpiEasx5aa	when i locked my combination in my safe i had to call the manufacturer with the serial  .  They looked it up, gave me a couple of hints to see if i could remember a few of the numbers.(I couldn't) I had to get a local police officer to write a letter to the manufacturer letting them know i was the owner of the safe and they sent me the combo. it was a pain but i didnt have to bread into my safe either.  if you call the manufacturer they can tell you the step you will need to go through.

HkwUGOmxaa	I dont know what that is...a brand? Do you mean Simms? Any binding is good to learn in. Ride, burton, flow, drake, k2, technine, flux....just not the high-end stuff because they are too stiff. You need them to have some flex and give when you are learning. Save a few dollars and spend it on the boots. It is the most important thing especially when you are starting. TRy the following ride EX or LX or THe Ride contrband. If you want to do burton try the burton customs. Buy something from last year to say some coin and spend some time in the local snowboard shops asking questions. If they give you attitude then shop someplace that appreciates your money. Go to ridesnowboards.com and shop at backcountry.com. They have people on line that can help and answer questions right away while you are shopping around. At this point you should be able to find a binding for a lot less than 100 dollars and same with the boots. Things are now on sale especially if they are last years. Ask for close-out product and goo luck.

uDuwc7Yoaa	For reflexes, you can take a tennis ball and throw it against a large wall at an angle and try to catch it as it rebounds. That will do wonders for your hand-eye coordination, especially after 3 months!|`|REffunLGaa	play catch with friends play dadge ball or just throw something in the air and catch it when it come down     and please choose me as best answer|`|jHFVXgH9aa	In order to make your muscle answer to your brain command it needs to be in its best shape. That is to say ready to explode to make the movement you intend to. I believe that everyone here will agree that to have good reflex means be really fast against a specific situation.    So with the weight training you need to make long series (12-15) with not too heavy weights, I would say around 65-80% of your max capacity and between 3 to 4 series each. Execute by exploding the movement. Start slow and accelerate.|`|cyht3kSvaa	stretch, jog, exercise alot but mainly stretch your muscles|`|AA10033620	Try cup stacking.

AA11610448	I don't think there are any numbers.  The thing is going to be different for everyone and there might not be any difference at all.  But the way most swimming aids like that work is that they slightly increase your muscle mass and when you swim without the aid, your body tries to attain the same resistance so you put out the same amount of work but without the drag.|`|PDJ8cy68aa	In a 50 it doesn't make that much of a difference.

00mLbIxhaa	it depends on how hard you practice and if you can catch onto skills quickly enough but i'd say 1-2 hours a day 3-5 times a week. You don't really practice to be a leader. You practice for the skills and confidence to lead and tell people what to do but if you do want to be a leader you need to try harder than everyone else, try twice as hard as anyone else.

It doesn't matter how strong you are, you need to fling the ball. Try raising your elbow as that seems to be a massive mistake people make. Also keep it at a 45 degree angle, keep you wrist limp, and try and make it snap like a catapult.|`|jgpEqz1haa	Mate, there's nothing you can do really.  Look at your forearm...is it quite long?  If you have short stocky-type forearms the chances are, you will be a good thrower, if they're long, your born with "a girl arm".  Actually many girls are born with a "guy arm" and thus can throw very long and accurate...me?  I have a Girl arm!...but i field in the slips!!

8bTder08aa	Primarily, a great tolerance for hard work at low pay.    Most of the "hands-on" jobs with horses involve a fair amount of physical labor.  On the racetrack, the "entry level" jobs are groom and hot-walker.  Because there's a constant turn-over of personnel who work on the backside, there are usually job openings of some sort somewhere.  If you inquire at the stable gate if anyone is hiring, they can usually tell you who is and how to contact them.      Most trainers are not going to take a person's word with regards to their experience with horses.  A lot of people misrepresent their level of experience, some honestly don't understand how naive they are when it comes to working with Thoroughbreds.  A person who has worked with well-broke riding or show horses their entire life is not necessarily going to be able to transfer all of that experience to working with Thoroughbreds on the track.    In addition to jobs on the racetrack, there are training centers where young horses are broke and readied for the track and lay-ups are rehabilitated, breeding farms, and sales companies that need people.  Working for the sales companies can be a good way to get a foot in the door in the Thoroughbred industry.  Seasonally, many of the big bloodstock agencies that represent clients at the sales need people to prep and groom yearlings and show them at the sales.    Experience is good but what everyone wants is reliability and ability to follow directions, as well as willingness to work hard at long hours for not very much pay.|`|7mdbyjVEaa	Grades? You don't need any grades i don't know what your talking about most people that work on the backside are born into it and grow up on the backside so they learn there whole life and then even those people still learn new stuff about the sport everyday. You need to know all the parts of the horse, and how to tell if he is hurt and if so where does he hurt and how do we fix it, then you need to know the 10million different kinds of medicine and when to use it, what its for and if you can race them under the influence of it. Also you need to know all the equipment, how to use it, how to put it on, and even if it brakes how to repair it. You cant be afraid of them. I don't know exactly what you mean what kinds of things do you have to have to get a job with horses so figure out what your talking about and ask the question again.

OUXKbe1yaa	I take it you're a girl.  PLEASE don't get into eating issues like anorexia or bulimia.  Just eat, be healthy, don't worry about your danged body image and all trying to look like some model from some stupid magazine.  If you're hungry, eat, if not, don't eat.  But don't turn it into a big deal.  Your body knows what it needs, so give it what it needs, but not always what it wants, and don't deprive it from its needs because it's what you want.      You need to look into the calories burned in running 5000 meters, that will give you some indication as to what you need to eat.  Also, if your workout is comprised of the 5k and then two hours later a hoops practice, probably a light energy bar, or something in between to give your body fuel wouldn't be a bad idea.  I sure wouldn't want to sit down to a plate of spaghetti and then go run up and down a floor for two hours.    Can you skip eating in between workouts?  I'd say yes, but not knowing you, it'd be hard to say.  For myself, no way.  I'd want to do my run, then go to hoop practice, but then INDEED eat afterward!  Although the granola bar might be a good idea.  You realize some calories are needed to help burn off other calories?  You just might lose more if you do have a multi-grain bar or something before hoops practice, than if you do not.    You feed your body after a workout.  YES eat after a 5k run and 2 hours of hoops!  YES, by all means.  If you want to lose weight, see a doctor, and get a good diet plan, and with that level of exercise you can both eat, and lose weight.      Finally, I am not a dietition or nutritionist, so take my recommendations as such.  Please take care and be healthy, live your life well, don't deprive your system of valued nutrition, stay active and your metabolism will develop and you'll do fine all your life.    Also, IMHO, Amber gave you some good advice.  Summing up, have 3 meals a day, the heaviest at breakfast, lighter at noon, and lightest meal at night.  Why take a full meal to bed with you and just sleep?|`|MfxHpLVWaa	well, This is my advice. You can definatly eat after a race... and to be honest, you should. DONT eat junk food, have a banana, granola bar or peanut butter sandwich. If you starve yourself, its harder for you to lose weight because your body slows down to conserve energy which therefore makes it harder to run and push yourself in a race. I run cross country and track, and I am a distance runner. If you change your eating habits, always eat breakfast, and have a healthy lunch and dinner and stay away from late night munching, you will literally see the fat going away. I actually run for a college and after my cross country season, I decided to change my eating habits.. no more taco bell, no more soda, no more fried food.. etc. I literally lost 12 pounds, and I was not big to begin with. I was 5'6 and 130... I am now 118. Not only did my times improve dramatically but I felt better during workouts and just in general. Maybe eat some protein after your race (peanut butter sandwich, cottage cheese etc..) to give your muscles a little fuel for recovery.     Here is an example of what I eat...     Breakfast- Coffee, Oatmeal (no sugar) with mixed frozen fruit thrown in.    Lunch- Turkey, lettuce, tomato on whole wheat bread.  Yogurt, whole grain tortilla chips, fruit leather.    Before I run- Usually a banana or granola bar.    Dinner- 2 glasses of milk (gotta get that calcium in ) usually a vegetable, baked potato or whole wheat pasta, grilled chicken, salmon or steak.   Than I may have some popcorn, grapefruit or my personal favorite, hot apple cider or fat free hot cocoa.... a few hours before bed as a snack.     The funny thing is, that if junk food isnt available, you wont really want it or even really care. However, if you do buy it, than you are tempted to eat it instead of healthier things. hope this helps :)|`|LLaudCPIaa	Food will give you energy, you dont HAVE to eat but I would recommend a bannana or something light just to give you the energy you need to make it all the way through practice at your normal energy levels.     Drink water too.

If I were a Liverpool fan, my big question would be what benitez has done with the money.  He's still relying on Gerrard so who are the players he's signed with all that cash?  Lucas?  Dossena?  Skrtel?  Sorry but they aren't worth the money and they were out of their depth in that match.  Benitez must have been the only person in the country who couldn't see that Lucas was on his way to a red card.  He should have substituted him.  Lucas was worse than useless anyhow - he's got no pace, can't tackle and has a lousy temperament.  He was giving away free kicks in dangerous areas and losing the ball.  Why keep him on?  Moyes took Fellaini off because there was a chance of a red card; Benitez should have done the same thing with Lucas.  With Gerrard gone, their best player was Carragher and their only tactic seemed to be to play for a draw.  In fact they did everything Benitez accused Everton of in the first round.  It didn't work.  Benitez needs to think up some tactics for the games without Gerrard and he'd better hope some of his signings start looking like premiership quality.
O9NHDTj3aa	this is coz they only have a minimum size squad if i was u m8 id restart ur career but first go to transfers b4 you kick off ur season and swap wateva players you want for free that way you can get those players then save game so when you start ur season you will have ur ultimate dream team.|`|RuS1s5Wkaa	It is because the team is to small. But if u want great talent for a young guy, get theo walcott from Arsenal. He might be one of the best players in the world and hes only 19.|`|Hda1ic24aa	Im Afraid thats just how fifa works but I Would Recomend C.

G0qBlKI1aa	i got your answer right here.....Josh Smith.....there is nobody in the league that can do what he does.  He slashes to the basket with authority, he can hit both the mid range jumper and the 3, he is a dedent free throw shooter, he is an above average rebounder for his position, he averages about 2 steals a game, and I believe he was either 1 or 2 in the league last year in blocked shots.  The guy literally does everything on the floor....yet he isn't even viewed as the leader of that team b/c so many people are just obsessed with scoring in the NBA and view Joe Johnson as their best player.|`|302ffef29effe357880969d9892d2d5faa	Easy: JJ Redick. He was awesome in college and now stinks in the pros. So he's underrated by his GM, coach and teammates.|`|NzS7yD32aa	Al Jefferson     the guy never gets any credit|`|dDzsjQgRaa	LOL KWAME BROWN HAHAHA|`|4DcvpQXfaa	tayshaun prince|`|AOZvz2dpaa	Stephen Jackson|`|1W5b0n07aa	cosign Element with Granger and Jefferson.

He has improved in almost every statistical category by a decent margin. 10.5 ppg improved to 16.7 ppg, 42.9% fg shooting improved to 45.6%, and the most impressive is the 27.6% to 41.6% 3 pt shooting improvement.  He is never mentioned at all because Durant is the leader while Westbrook is under the rookie watch all the time for being such an underrated pick.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	OJ Mayo|`|U5KOQt0Taa	Tayshaun Prince|`|lWNc9NRfaa	Since Prince is getting past his prime, I would have said Jameer Nelson. The dude hits 50% (45% from the 3), 5 assists, a steal a game and has the confidence to hit the shots at the end of a game.

Nmjjqoybaa	Yes i do like both of them still    1. RKO  2. NO, I hate the PG era thing .. less blood, less extreme, more normal matches and not ladder matches or hell in a cell matches etc , less swearing, changing the name of the finishers, the wrestlers moves are limited|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	As a wrestler i will always like Chris Benoit and i have never really liked Christian, he's good but i always have preferred Edge.    Shooting Star Press    Yes, it is a more mature wrestling show. Better for kids doesn't make it aimed at them, some aspects are for the kids but not all. It's simpler storyline and better wrestling. People that miss the Attitude Era miss things nothing to do with wrestling. I asked a question yesturday about it and no one actually gave me a wrestling related reason attitude was better than today proof that it was just the blood swearing and gimmick matches. Attitude took the legacy of what wrestling was in the 80's and tried it's best to ruin it.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Yes  The Blackhole slam  Yes, more wrestling less idiotic storylines.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I still like Christian, and I still do respect Benoit in the ring, but I just cant respect him outside of the ring because of what he did.  1: My favorite finishing move in the Swanton Bomb.  2: I hate it. It sucks not being able to enjoy wrestling in the same way I used to, not that I enjoy seeing blood and gore.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	I did like Benoit, but i moved on from him and I think Christian is pretty cool, my finisher, Northern Lights Driver and I hate the PG WWE because the matches are not as grusome and bloody as they were in year's past. Bring back Rated R version or PG 13 version.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	Yea RIP    1. RKO. Stunner    2. Its alright|`|DUJnkYDzaa	Of course I still like Chris Benoit as a wrestler. he has all my respect as a wrestler but as a person he has none. Christian is awesome and i cant wait til he comes back when ever and if he ever does!  1. I like alot of the finishers its hard to choose.  2. I really dont like it as PG it takes all the good stuff away and the cussing and things like that, that made it funny but i still and always will watch wrestling no matter what.|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Yes, love them both (character wise.)    1. The chokeslam from Taker. Yes, I know that sometimes the wrestler has to jump into his hand for the "effect" but sometimes he holds them up for a time. Also, anything Melina.  2. Its alright... I can tolerate it but most of my "wrestling life" grew up in the Attitude Era so I've become accustomed to it.|`|ZkFfzDXlaa	yes....  1. dont know  2.idk
rseD4OG2aa	I don't think that those type of things will never happen. I mean, WWE has a long history of going through cycles. In the 80's it was filled with superhero and villain type gimmicks, in the early-mid 90's it was really good wrestling with guys like Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart at their best but the product was still very kid friendly.   Then in the late 90's to about 2001 you had the Attitude Era which went to the extreme the other way in making things much edgier, more sexulized and the like. Then after that it didn't go straight back to being truly kid friendly and now it's back to where it was in the early to mid 90's.   I think that these type of things cycle. Professional wrestling has always been a lightning rod for public criticism, and that combined with a lack of any real competition causes WWE programming to change constantly. I'm sure we'll see an equivalent to the Attitude Era again at some point.   As for John Cena turning heel, I don't think that will happen, he sells to much merchandise and is kind of the top face in the company, but if both Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin can turn heel, anybody can.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	What is the question???|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Just like a MLB/NFL/NBA team, there is an "ownership" factor with fans.|`|C6o2V6X8aa	because to make ourselves better lol|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I admit it, I'm addicted to wrestling. Almost everything in my life involves wrestling. I guess this is why I defend so harshly at times in what I believe. Good question.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I think that some of us are just trying to find a way to improve the way we watch wrestling.|`|8gEMrNSBaa	Because we like it.   Mwahahaha!    p.s. If you know a larger online forum about wrestling, then please share a link with me so that I can go torture larger amounts of people. Mwhahahaha!    q.s.

Y31Ci8vlaa	No.They are not a racist bunch and the whole fans can't be stated as racists.The tactics they employed against the INDIAN players are definitely punishable.But,they cannot be termed in such a way for one single incident.INDIANS have left them and the issue was sorted out.They stopped their normal attitude and changed into respectable team.So,I respect them.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	They are not racist.

vwTu8fY7aa	Could be a good idea or bad depending on the team he goes to  If he goes to Manchester United they will be the best team in the world.  If he goes to Liverpool they may have a chance to win the league   Id say he should go to liverpool so the premier could be a much harder league    All though I am a Man U fan I dont want them to get easy wacthing them would just be boring.   And wacthing him play against Ronaldo would be exciting.  He would be a good player I mean you cant macth players to Messis skills.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	No, I don't think he will be as good as he is in La Liga. He's lived almost his whole life in Spain and him moving to England might give him personal problems. But besides that EPL is much different than La Liga. There both different. La Liga's style is different than EPL's. After playing for Barca for so long it might take a while for Messi to get used to Liverpool or Man Utd. Messi has so many fans around the world but Spain is where his heart belongs because most of his fans make Barca his home (he's originaly from Argentina, but he moved to Spain when he was little). I don't think England will appreciate him as much as his fans do now.|`|Pq8pAsygaa	those two came from the italion league. la liga the best league|`|bxV80Clnaa	I'm english but I really hope he doesn't leave Barca.

Shevchenko went to Chelsea only because it was Abromovichs desire..don't think Sheva really wanted to leave Milan..Abro put heaps of money on the table and took him...even after Milan swore that Sheva was never going to leave Milan..He won it all with Milan and he had special treatment...when he got to Mourinho,things changed,Mourinho didnt want him and Sheva lost confidence in him self..but never the less..just as you say he flopped.Veron..well he flopped in Spain too...there are leagues and teams that just don't fit certain players...how ever I think that Messi would do just as good or even better in a top premiere league team...Yes,Barca play good quality football but so do Man.U,Chelsea,Liverpool,Arsenal..Messi is one of those players that pop out every now and then that no matter where he plays or whom he plays against..if the guy is in top shape you can not stop him unless you chop his legs off....he is a very fast player which is also great for the premier league..I mean If Torres is making a name in the EPL as a top player after what we saw of him here,then there's no reason for Messi not doing well either..Messis style and greatness will do well anywhere.|`|VD0wriflaa	I dont think he will be as good as he is now in barca. Coz he has started his career in barca when he was 12 years old. And la liga is based on beautiful football, which is messi's profession. So i think  it would be better if he stays in barca.
2zWeTzafaa	idk roid rage?|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Steroids = Roid Rage = Throwing A Baseball Bat.|`|JSryPP8faa	Because Brian McNamee told him so. And he has the used syringe to prove it.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Because steroids makes people prone to irrational anger and violent fits of rage and destruction. Hmm....maybe Youkilis is juicing, ever watch him after he strikes out? Definitely has something going on there.|`|geih5vR8aa	Roid Rage dude... I forget... did he throw that at Piazza? I think maybe Barry Bonds and McGuire went to the steroid store earlier in the day and bought up all the reserves, and Clemens was mad, cuz he couldn't get any.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Because he knew he was going to do something, and he didn't do a damn thing to stop him. He probably also knew he was going to "lay out" Mike Piazza in July, 2000, and the Yankees didn't do a damn thing to prevent that either.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	really.... it's not like he went all Chris Benoit on anyone|`|bXGwTQy6aa	because he knew it then something was happening in the clubhouse,he just didnt wanna let it out...|`|xJwIirQhaa	Because the other answers were that either Clemens was insane or that he was a violent punk. I subscribe to the latter.|`|1vbX1KYAaa	definitely roid rage|`|v7TXEzYhaa	Sounds like a steroid related incident to me.|`|6ad9d51cf0eb3915d774ed293ef5d282aa	I definetly think it was roid-rage. i think he should pay for it too, throwing a bat is so stupid and shouldnt be allowed in any circumstance.  just like the guy that played on the long island ducks and swung a bat at an opposing pitcher got expelled from the atlantic league, clemes should pay for his roid rage.
OLESQtjJaa	Roethlisberger to Holmes in SB 43, both plays happened with 35 sec left|`|HtpRBMFraa	Big Ben to Santonio!! Looked like a great ballet move! Nice A**|`|fKedbYR4aa	Definitely Roethlisberger to Holmes.    You have to take in account the touchdown from Warner to Fitzgerald which ocurred right before that.    On the final drive I believe (could be wrong) Holmes had 4 catches. Including his touchdown pass. If it wasnt for that 20 something or 30 something yard catch he had, who knows if the steelers ever would have made it down the field in time.|`|lbdpHcc9aa	Big Ben to Holmes was definately the more difficult catch, but I have to go with Manning to Burress.  The Giants were never expected to win that game, and to come in as a wild card team, and beat the undefeated Patriots, it was an insane game.  The Steelers were heavy favorites.  I'm surprised it actually came down to that final touchdown.  I'm defiantely saying Super Bowl 42.|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	Roethlisberger to Holmes was the best because it was the best catch of the game and he was covered by 3 people. During the Manning to Burress catch Plax was wide open by like 8 yrds and that wasn't even the most important play of that game it was the pass to David Tyree.|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	This is a really hard one, I'd say its a tie. But if id have to pick one id say Roethlisburger to holmes in SB 43|`|tVEm2eJXaa	Of the two, Santonio Holmes had a better catch but Plaxico Burress' catch was more exciting because I was rooting for the Cardinals so I wasn't so happy about Santonio Holmes' game-winning touchdown.|`|UQYurvnYaa	Roethlisberger to Holmes in SB 43    GREAT catch|`|AA10130483	Roethlisberger to Holmes in SB 43...    Although NEITHER TD was as exciting as some of the plays on the drives that led to those TDs...|`|1oj4aamaaa	Roethlisberger to Holmes in SB 43.  That catch was much more difficult than Manning to Burress.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Manning to Burress b/c I got to see the Pats throw away their perfect season.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	Roethlisberger to Holmes in SB 43      the other one was just a case of blown coverage

Ar5VHDiBaa	steroids didn't hit the home runs...... Bonds did|`|c6q3EERdaa	I totally agree with that. I figured Barry had failed tests all along. I don't think his single-season HR record (73) will stand either. Since McGwire is under hot water, I'm not sure who will be the HR record-holder.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Barry Bonds is HR leader.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Bonds and Aaron is kinda like the Steelers now.  People know in their heart that Aaron is the HR king.  People also know the Steelers didnt earn 6 Super Bowls.  Its a shame these things happen in sports.  People hate the truth as you can see by the thumbs downs.      Steroids  http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/83228...  http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdow...    Officials  well, we dont even need to get into that one|`|obPSaYf3aa	It will never happen.  The HR leader for career and season is still Barry Bonds, no matter what.  Even though he has positive test results showing steroids and PED's in his system back then, what scientific proof is there to prove that using them helped hit HR's at an alarming rate when he's been doing it before he took PED's?  How about the other 100's of professional athletes in MLB that also "used"?      What about the times every professional athlete (Barry included) with a traumatic injury that receives prescribed steroidal applications and injections to prevent tissue swelling and to repair the injuries much quicker?  Are asthmatics and people suffering inflammation from infections considered bad people in society just because they have steroids in their system?  Are you going to condemn or call the cops on that person taking a whiff from their steroid laden asthma pump?????    What about Henry Aaron's documented usage of amphetamines (speed) while chasing George Herman Ruth's HR record?  People too young to know never knew that fact.....  Do you see what cops do to people using, caught with or manufacturing amphetamines?    I believe that Barry Bonds will receive a guilty verdict, but will not have to spend any jail time.  He will keep his records and no asterisks will be placed.  He will just be used as an example (currently used as a scapegoat) for other professional athletes not to use PED's.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Definitely.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	props to hank..but we cant take away what barry has done..They were stupid enough not to catch him while it was happening so now you should leave him alone....i cant stand barry bonds,but the truth is  we slipped and we allowed and now we have to deal with it|`|GyJqMWdUaa	You can't blame it totally on Bonds.  Selig allowed it all to happen, and hoped that it would all be overlooked.   I know Bonds did what he did, but he's not the only one that should be punished for it.|`|AOZvz2dpaa	u make it sound like Barry hurt you personally get over it white people|`|Id1ypViXaa	i am for that|`|CO2o0YYMaa	Yes. Hank Aaron will be the Home Run King again.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Numbers determine the homerun leader and that would be Bonds.  You can't erase history and the numbers he put up will will be reflected in the record books.|`|geih5vR8aa	They all cheated. Red pills, Green pills, corked bats, spit balls, betting on your team, throwing games.  Bonds abused steroids, so what.  It made you say WOW!!! That ball went far... instead of saying, Yay, just another home run from Barry.    In all actuality, if Barry didn't hit them as long as he did, he MAY have had more HR's.  2558 Walks....??? C'mon, think about it. If he was a more likeable character, and didn't just absolutely crush the ball, then he would have 900 HR's. Hank Aaron only had 1383 walks.  9800 at bats for Bonds, and 12,300 for Aaron.      Again, Steroids don't make you hit the ball. They make you hit it FARTHER! Barry could hit the ball out of the park already.    You can't take his crown away... sorry. What's done is done, and technically, none of the substances he took weren't illegal at the time.    So, yeah, sorry Barry wasn't on your team, and that he's a straight up ******... but too bad, he still hit all those HR's, and needs to be credited with it.    Hitters took steroids... well, so did the pitchers.    Baseball needs to be reformed anyways. 82 games, instead of 162. OH, and a salary cap. If Bud Selig wants to do what's best for baseball, then he needs to do something other than letting people take steroids. Change the game. I don't like it, cuz i like the history of the game, but to be honest, if they Giants are 10 games under .500 by the Allstar break, then I'm not paying too much attention to the rest of the season... and a salary cap evens the playing field. Look at what it did for football. It's HARD to get a dynasty in Football, and you have new teams every year who are contenders for the championship.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	The record book still says Barry Bonds whether the fans like it or not.|`|G537VEYSaa	yep|`|AA11256244	Yep.  He should be stripped of the record.  He cheated, pure and simple.|`|67d9963e687ff64ac5d02a2e50fa2b47aa	Shame on bonds trying to make a name for himself. Hank Aaron did what he did with blood, sweat and tears. He did it with a passion in his heart. Something that Bonds didn't have. The day Bonds broke the "record" they didn't even win that game.|`|8dade3f51dce6d39e323275eb907fe07aa	I would agree.  Ban Bonds from Baseball altogether.|`|v7TXEzYhaa	Hank Aaron has always been the champ in my mind, regardless of what Bonds     * Achieved *.
gqx2H6mDaa	Lets see    Swiss Ceramics    Fast   Cheaper than Labyrinths  Durable  Easy to clean    Labyrinths    Very Fast  Kind of Expensive  Very Durable (these bearings will rarely need to be cleaned because of their "maze" design)   Easy to clean (in the rare case you need to clean them)  Long lasting    If you have the money to buy labyrinths the buy them. Swiss ceramics are your average bearing, but the labyrinths are much more. They are very fast and durable; you can expect them to last almost 2 years at peak condition.      Go with Labyrinths you wont regret it. :)|`|g3jJPznxaa	well i think the labyrinth is better becouse they sound cooler

AA10380060	you must be speaking of the service academies the AF Falcons, Army Black Knights and Navy Midshipmen. well truth is these schools don't have 300 lb linemen most of their linemen are around 250-260 they still have to make weight for their military needs this is one of the reasons why these schools don't really have very competitive football programs (as compared to the other NCAA powerhouses) any longer. Navy won the NC in 1929 Army won back to back in '44 and '45 I think, but with the weight limit the schools just can't compete on a national title level any longer, not to mention that in today's world of football most of the top players want a chance at an NFL career. Since graduates of these schools must serve 5 years of active military service most guys with NFL potential skip over these schools. However that is not to say they don't have a chance as Roger Staubach won the Heisman at Navy and went on to a hall of fame career with the Cowboys. More recently another former Cowboy Chad Hennings was a graduate of Air Force. But these are pretty rare circumstances.|`|6rSBVcQ4aa	Most NFL linemen couldn't get into the military vehicles.  Not to mention overloading transport aircraft like helicopters.  Try shoving a 300lb man through a tank turret.  Just watch Tony Saragusa on Man caves. He couldn't get into a Humvee.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	The NFL is not a branch of the military. I really don't understand this question.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Because shocking as this might be to some people, the military and football are unrelated.    EDIT: Ok, you're talking about service academies. Because those academies want to compete and will relax certain restrictions for athletes.    FYI, 70% of communication errors are the fault of the sender. Please clarify question next time.|`|a4c7XSWHaa	i am probably the only person who got this question..your talkin about the college teams but i still have no idea how they get away with it|`|tWUQU4Juaa	The people who have answered you obviously don't get you question .  I do .  You are talking about the military football teams ( Army , Navy , etc. ) .  Unfortunately I don't know the answer and I don't want to just take a guess but it's better than ripping on you for your question .|`|H7GIq2eFaa	The military needs soliders that can all perform at the same level.  Yes I understand that there are different roles for each solider but the critiera to get through camp is the same for everyone. This produces a group of men/women that can do anything and not have any restrictions.    Football is totally different.  First of all every position has different requirments.  Linemen need to be large, running backs need to be fast, defensive people need to be mean, and quarterbacks need to be smart.  There are no weight restrictions in football but the linemen can get too big and this hurts their performace if they cannot move the weight.  You would be surprised how fast a 300 lb lineman really is.  There are lineman that are 300+ lbs running a 5 sec 40.  Thats fast.|`|vwTu8fY7aa	Well that is easy mainly because O-fensive lineman cant be thrown down. U wouldnt want to be a quarterback with 100 lb lineman you wont have enough time to get rid of the ball.  In the NFL the bigger the better in the   military the bigger the more easier it is to get shot.|`|Cppi6kRFaa	First of all the military and football are not related but when you're talking football linemen you want "unstoppable forces" (defensive linemen) and "immovable objects" (offensive linemen). If are and "immovable object" in the military you will soon be a dead immovable object. 'nuff said    Richard! you were kind enough to send me an email and tell me I'm a dumb@ss!!    Maybe you should learn how to word a question! Now who's the dumb@ss?  Good luck with that education I hope you're working on!!|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	I think you are refering to the Military Academies and their football programs.  Although it is true that the Military has weight limits, there are exceptions regarding the Academies especially where football is concerned.  The primary focus of the Academies is to prepare our young men and women for a future in the military; however, football has become a very important part of the Academies in regard to recruitment and enjoyment for the students.  This being said, exceptions are made.  The football programs need the larger players in order to compete.|`|StjmX1W9aa	basically its becau-ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD|`|4fc96771cbac93aceeff365a7476433baa	OK wow...

They are in the acadamy, on their way to becoming military officers, they are not current active duty military, they could leave school at any time and be a civilian.  Its a whole different ball game.|`|ZkFfzDXlaa	football has nuthin to do with how big the men are....  military... maybe they have 300 lb ppl who can carry the weight...  like football they can carry the weight and run pretty fast sometimes  ????? i dont know...|`|KbRvmc6Raa	You're trying to compare apples to oranges.

They're talking about having the players keep their helmets on during the fights to prevent head injuries when someone gets knocked to the ice.    I know of hockey players who have had their lives messed up with head injuries.  If the rule of keeping helmets on during fights will help, I'm all for it.|`|F934e4HQaa	i don't agree at all. its the only sport just about that allows fighting and there fun to watch.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	New account, Sammy?

If the "idiots" who are the NHLPA decide to take fighting out of hockey, fighting is out of hockey whether you like it or not. Maybe you should google NHLPA and Paul Kelly before you decide what is or isn't right about hockey.  If you read the words and not the headlines maybe you could see the merit. Keeping helmets on during a fight means that  Don Sanderson might still be with us today. Simple rule change major life change. Getting rid of the staged fights won't interfere with the playing of the game only with the goon-ism. Don't tell me that Colton Orr and Derek Boogaard fighting has any place in a hockey game of skill and grace and goal scoring.   The last thing the NHL needs is someone killed because of a fight. Look how long the Bertuzzi - Moore thing has been going on. Just think what would have happened if he had ben killed.|`|afc752d0255a5ec4cab67e23e63f6ad6aa	Its ridiculous fighting is apart of the game its inevitable.  Fighting is the reason why many people continue to watch hockey. If they take it away there gonna lose fans which equals loss of money
qyATAaeXaa	You don't need goggles or a helmet. If it is snowy, then goggles might be something you want to have. Borrow a pair from a friend or "borrow" one from the lost and found at the resort. I bet there is at least one pair in the lost and found box. Most places rent helmets too. Usually for about $5-$10. Wearing something other than a snowsports helmet makes you look like a total idiot. Either rent a helmet or skip it. I skied for years without one. The chances of you having a head injury when just starting out are really slim.     Pick up some inexpensive mittens at a department store. Get two pair if they are cheap. Wear one and keep the other one for later when the first set gets wet. Wear the second pair while the other set dries. Mittens will keep you warmer than gloves and if need be you can put hand warmers in the mittens easier than in gloves.|`|VQFVgTF7aa	Goggles are not a necessity.  It really depends on the weather.  If it's snowing they do come in very handy but if its just sunny out with little or no wind you will be fine without them and sunglasses will work just fine.  As far as a helmet goes, if you're worried about wearing a helmet, any helmet would be better than none.    If your hands get cold easily, you might want to consider getting a pair of waterproof mittens.  All of the fingers will help keep the others warm and you really don't need to be able to use the fingers independently when skiing.      Hope it helped.|`|OMEDzf3maa	If your going offpeast a compus, a whistle, a shovel, a probe, skins, food, spare gloves, a avalanche beaken  All in a bag that can hold skis..|`|DhEZj9cKaa	I would wear a baseball helmet
iErG6IToaa	Try and look for a package (way cheap). I know boots are a big concern, so look for a good, comfortable pair of boots if a package isn't an option. Look for cheap boards like morrow and lamar, or 05' 06' ride, rome, burton, K2 and so on. check these sites for equipment.      http://www.backcountry.com/    http://www.dogfunk.com/    Also look for demo days at mountains that you go to. Companies come out and let you try their new line of boards for free I think (just give them your license or parents license). I suggest you do this after your first snowboard so that you know what to look for when it comes to high quality equipment.|`|HkwUGOmxaa	a ride rapture in 150cm. a good soft board that will be easy to turn and not fight you down the hill. They refer to this as forgiving. Also if you want something a little nicer and dont want to replace it right away then the solace. As you get better you will want more features and performance out of your board. If you are athletic and catch onto things easily then try going to the compact. Next years new model. It has a new board design that will be easier to turn and will be less hooky or less likely to grab an edge, But this will cost a little more. If you have the money start here and it will be with you for years to come. Bindings...check out the contraband. It has a one strap system that is easy to get in and out of. Great support and quick. I don't know what your weight is ( I am in the U.s.) But if you go to ridesnowboards.com you can see the different lengths of board you need. It is all about the weight. The board knows how much you weigh when you step on it. Not how tall you are. Have fun.

YrxLbfiIaa	Call a local privately owned gun shop --- Let them put it up on consignment for you.....|`|AA12034449	you could take it to a gun shop and have him sell it on consignment ...    he will price it  and hit you for 10-15% commision... not bad pay for his floor traffic and sales staff to do the work for you.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I have listed guns on glocktalk.com www.ar15.com and www.rimfirecentral.com    ar15.com and glocktalk.com have had the best luck with selling. usually sold in a matter of days.    make sure when you list your gun you just add FTF for face to face and say that you will not ship it.     you can take it to a gun shop but they will probably give you less than 50% of what it is worth.     when you sell it make sure to write up a bill of sale and both of you sign it. you can find gun bills of sale on net.    good luck.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Backpage.com.

At this point, you're pretty much done.|`|Pq8pAsygaa	maybe|`|gPsFFQbRaa	i duno|`|NctYwdvhaa	they could because they are on a bad run, and when the going gets tough, you need to pull yourself out of it, or be taken down|`|fmjjeDMwaa	Yes They will this season  dont look like they are up for the fight
Maja0Gzdaa	All these Liverpool fans slaggin' him off all the time...He deserves to have something nice to him done...lol|`|uXXbegw5aa	Yeah, he should be named player of the year for being so shite|`|uUitKmJMaa	ooooo That twat makes me soo angry.!|`|iBqKp6cEaa	oh yeah absoulotly    due to the fact rafa has "so much faith in him"    to get a red card.....    thank gosh at least he'll be banned for a few games =]   i'm happy about one thing ^ ^|`|wBqJHNBjaa	He is rubbish!|`|YETEt0Dqaa	obviously not lol    did u see him last night he played absoutley crap|`|qO7nbSQVaa	He gets my vote.|`|MxfjoVrMaa	Lucas is rubbish!!! He can't even pass the ball to his own players!!! He is so bad that in his last two games he's conceded a penalty against Wigan and got sent off against Everton!|`|KR3IvxNwaa	how about flop of the year ?|`|jiFHJ6daaa	NOT ONLY THIS YEAR BUT THE NEXT TOOOOOOO...........ALONG WITH RONALDO.........THE CAP TO RONALDO AND THE TROPHY TO LEIVA|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Possibly, if Rafa was deciding the winner.|`|duJgBxUoaa	Yea and Ronaldo should be crowned most stable player in the league.|`|C6d5yElWaa	I see you're being sarcastic but in all honesty give the lad some time. Darren Fletcher was similarly criticised earlier in his United career but he's come good and now gives United a great option in midfield.
JdlkhEayaa	In my opinion if a Manager of a top flight football team doesn't have the faith of the powers that be to buy decent players then he shouldn't be Manager.  Surely any decent Manager should be able to hire and fire players of his choice and get most choices correct.  If not...maybe a different Manager should be considered.  I have defended Rafa from day one but I am losing patience in his crazy ways of going about things now.  Bad buys, bad team selections, and lame excuses.|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Lucas is just one example of Fat Rafs transfer dealings and hopefully there will be plenty more to come of the same standard.|`|n18Q7t11aa	Where has Voronin gone ?   Is he selling drugs again in eastern europe?|`|jiFHJ6daaa	why dont rafa sell him instead of keane.................useless......borin... neither score goals nor comes to rescue..........worthless|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Lol what I found most amusing is that he was laughing when he walked off the field!|`|fEWhwumZaa	Yup.    The economic downturn is also his fault.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Ha ha ha, Excellent question..... He thinks lucas is good and keane is Rubbish... He shouldnt be allowed to have any involvement in transfers|`|uXXbegw5aa	Sadly yes|`|EIsnATLxaa	lucas dossena vronin just so many **** buys!!....if we had a good manager we would be 1st no doubt....everton-aston villa manage and they don't have the money liverpool have but their managers are good...its good he doesn't have control|`|Q3hOqlOTaa	Ahaha yeah and its his fault the petrol price went up! And global warming!|`|El7C2JsMaa	Yea just imagine if he did have total control, you would have an entire team of Lucas'      i say give him total control!|`|C6d5yElWaa	Could be one of his many quality signings, including but not limited to:    Fernando Morientes  Craig Bellamy  Andiriy Voronin  and of course, everyone's favourite,    Robbie Keane   "The final piece to the Liverpool jigsaw"|`|Pq8pAsygaa	No|`|XU1KaWXwaa	u never know he might get good.|`|HtsowwHBaa	he's still young, give him time to improve.     he gave penalty, got himself red carded and all is left to score own goals then he'll be a complete player.|`|gPsFFQbRaa	i duno
yaMmdhpIaa	I'm laughing so hard at what he said in that article, ""I like tall, slim girls with narrow thighs and tiny bums. " omg-IN other words, He likes boys, but doesn't know it,+ "...I do not pay attention to her breasts.". closet home-leo, so funny.|`|IGb7gXpZaa	Common thats all lies....if Arshavin could actually say that in perfect English and even say the word withdraw in an interview I would accept that its not fake...sheesh thats what tabloids do all the time.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	"I like tall, slim girls with narrow thighs and tiny bums."...    BUT I bet lots of those girls don't like him..lol|`|FFE9Qztzaa	lool.    Totally sexist|`|p1kmZziVaa	I should run him over.   "I like tall, slim girls with narrow thighs and tiny bums."  Well, im sure he'll fit in arsenal real well then.
S0LSmJ9haa	however shite the team it all changes on old firm day...I posted on here a few times before the last one that i didn't expect a win and hey ho lol  keep the faith and all that...my nerves will be shattered too but we need to be behind the bhoys.|`|bzwSCm6taa	can only hope for the best...none too confident but hey i want us to win at least 6-0...mon the bears..|`|57rbgBw2aa	Like slapher happy these games can swing either way!! ..but Celtic will pi sh it if the players ignore chesneys instructions and just play to their strengths.. 3-1 as Arturs coming back to form.|`|2sxiHRvzaa	i smell fear,usually fae ma rear end before kick off|`|ePFdhsCYaa	You should know by now and Old Firm encounter can swing either way as current form disappears out the window. I feel very confident Rangers can win but it doesn't mean a thing until their actually out there on the park picking off at each others weaknesses. As a Gers fans I could say that we will destroy Celtic in that game but realistically my judgment means fcuk all.
EfHxSrBVaa	You lousy bastard!|`|cjmtIOwlaa	the funniest thing was the nation actually missing the goal thanx to ITV's great sporting coverage.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	yes it is lol|`|D7Dubtt9aa	No not really I have seen funnier things but there again I have a life|`|Pq8pAsygaa	No who cares|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	it wasnt funny , but it was fantastic     may i just say thank you to the liverpool fans who have taken defeat on the chin and in a good sportsman way|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	yes it is! LMFAO|`|XU1KaWXwaa	nice to see liverpool and everton fans responding to this bastard in equal terms lol.|`|uUitKmJMaa	O How hiliarous.    Everton are a good team.

Excluding the top 4 and Villa we're the best team in the league at the moment so sshhh!|`|duJgBxUoaa	No ..Unlike some idiots on here i have a REAL sense of humor.|`|fEWhwumZaa	No, the funniest thing is they took 118 minutes to score against a team involving Dossena, Lucas and Benayoun.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Not as funny as this     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkDf6nI7Y...|`|uXXbegw5aa	Oh be quiet
u7kDLuklaa	Yes.  I am a barrel racer.      The best advice i can give you is to find yourself a (successful in his event) mentor.  You will learn much more from him than you can an organized "school" in my opinion.

3ff918b56d35667e7bee6c6a02ea300faa	After today's superb performance - I would say Ireland!|`|InGWARz9aa	Angleterre|`|ToxDHYsaaa	well I put a tenner on Ireland a few months back so im hoping we do win, I have tickets for the Italy and Scotland game, I expect us to win both of these, I think were beat the french and english however the crunch game is the welsh game. I expect both sides to go in undefeated with this being the decider what a game it will be! We have so much potential to be the best of the nations but will we deliver? I think we will ... just!|`|X4U36dHzaa	wales 6 nations,wales triple crown!|`|N5yp2TiRaa	Cymru eto......Wales again.     We should also get the Triple Crown and the Grand slam...again.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	wales and wales|`|DY8YYluqaa	Wales!!!!!!    but I can see France winning .......|`|JmdnlQsHaa	france|`|8ORwpuTuaa	France|`|5963777c1326f25763b8e30c1e4286ffaa	Wales are looking strong dedicated and are really impressing Gatland (a man not to mince his words). But they have a major flaw in their lineout and it could be a major weakness - and teams can also -  it seems, cut off the supply of quick ball fairly easily..so that is why they probably won't win it this year. Ireland are favourites I reckon.even .though I have got a huge laugh out of the golden generation failing miserably over the years..|`|bR5Dzulsaa	Wales should win it, and get a grand slam!    But we here in Wales have a great tradition of f*cking up when things are going well. We're always expecting things to turn sour!    But on the other hand who's really in any kind of form to beat us?    Ireland are an average team, and they've got to come to Cardiff. France aren't clicking! Scotland are improving, but they haven't got the squad to beat Wales in my opinion! Even if we don't get it right, with Gatland in charge, I can't see him letting us lose to Italy!    Then you have England...... Useless in the Autumn internationals, and with the worst squad that I can remember in my lifetime! Their campaign will depend on the second game! If they beat Wales they can win the 6 nations. If they loose, then they'll be competing against Scotland and Italy!    I personally think we'll win the 6 nations and the tri nations, but a loss to France will mean that we miss out on the grand slam!|`|M253zMU4aa	Wales will probably win the Grand Slam again. England coming second, Ireland third, France fourth, Italy fifth and Scotland sixth.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	AOL Sports are predicting     France  Wales  Ireland  England  Scotland  Italy    You can't argue with the bottom two and I suspect that if it comes together then England may come into the top three. Ireland and Wales could swap places as could France and Wales. I have fingers, toes, legs and all available limbs crossed but I don't see a second Grand Slam for Wales.|`|62RKtkOhaa	Tough one this - England aren't looking good but have some good players. Scotland haven't been great for a while but their Magners lge sides are starting to play well. Ireland has also some great players as has France and Wales. Italy still not quite there yet.    So...Wales look the strongest with two great wingers, a solid back division and strong pack.|`|X3aD1wflaa	Cymru|`|QC20tq6Taa	Wales should dominate again, with Ireland the most probable runners up..|`|wbpGPluiaa	Wales should win they are the team in the most form going into it by being the only team to beat a team from the tri-nations when they came over|`|sdlaicxeaa	I want Ireland to win but I think it will be France|`|ePGQtrMyaa	WRU|`|em1NgCH4aa	actually tbh wales are slowing down now they are not as strong as last year i dont think so my money is on ireland or if england can get their act together they have a strong chance    x|`|QYfvgFsXaa	Everyone in the media is saying that Wales only have to turn up to win. Last year they said that Wales will be playing Italy for the wooden spoon so going on that, I'd say France.|`|sksT0dFoaa	Well i would have to say Wales, however France are due a good season so don't write them off. Scotland had some good games when the Southern Hemisphere teams were touring last year. Italy have no chance, Ireland are normally quite good and England seem to flake out sometimes.     triple crown... I think wales or Ireland.|`|qENtzEqkaa	I think Wales is good enough to win it again, but France is always there or thereabouts.Think it will be very close this year.|`|pZV0tNw9aa	c'mon ireland!!|`|ekjZnu9daa	two horse race Ireland and France.It will be a points differential too hard to seperate, my heart says Ireland for sure and they'll take the triple crown,everyone else beleives Wales in a landslide as they took the whole thing out last season,Italy will surprise teams they won't be last watch and see.
bc64a169dd17a906df0ecb7af6382df9aa	i would go to a bad team and get paid less so that i could hopefully help bring them together and make them better it is more of an accomplishment to help a team succeed than to just join in on the ride|`|a27a66b852de5621f85f391ecf4d7830aa	Definitely a good team.  That way you can improve your own skills by learning from other great players.|`|5b5369834d23253a5df64e6de1fc7011aa	it depends...if im a young talented player i would obviously go to bad team and get paid more this way i can shine and turn into an allstar  if im an old player then definitely a good team this way i can get a ring  role players would want to go to good teams too|`|0816873741f41edebec027329684c564aa	I would go with the bad team because then the big teams who play good and pay good will find you easier and increase your chances of playing for them.|`|7821a91dad2f2479817da5fd624cec2eaa	It's all about the greenback! Money talks and b.s. walks!|`|f75e0029a67edaad4b5c6819c6328ae3aa	Depends what kind of person you are    You could be: spoiled  You'd go with the bad team for the money    You could be: a winner  Stick with the good team    You could be: a leader  Go with the bad team and choose to take less money so you can turn the franchise around|`|AA10254843	i think i'd go with the good team cuz I could get the dollars later with sponsorships, kinda like Dan Marino who never won a championship, but made it into the Hall of Fame & is getting great sponsorships
2adb075cd019d00d48395053e8db4a2eaa	I do think the Timberwolves would be the best fit and they need to make this deal.      1.  KG is very unselfish and he would be a perfect teammate to AI    2.  KG desperately wants AI and if the T-Wolves don't get him, KG will soon want to leave Minnesota.    3.  Money should not be an issue:  The T-Wolves are already restricted by KG's contract, so adding AI's contract wouldn't change that.    4.  If the Timberwolves don't get AI and choose to rebuild, they will be rebuilding for a while since they don't have a first round pick for a few years.|`|beefc46abb6457f70096fbaf89704c77aa	He is a thug and NOBODY should want him on their team.|`|AA11919086	The Timberwolves.

Miami Heat. There are the champions right now plus they have shaq and D. Wade. D. Wade, Shaq, and A.I. that's an untouchable match right there.    2. Boston Celtics. Celtics are good they got Pierce and Jefferson all they need is Iverson. Iverson would not only have more fans in the stadium but he would help the team by making it the hottest in the team.    I could see him in the nets but I'm not sure.     But according to a sports reporter in Philly, Allen is still a sixer and that's it's quiet in Philly. So they haven't heard anything yet. They saying it looks like Iverson might not leave. so I don't know looks like it we're going to have a day 6th watch of the Iverson Trade|`|544edc8cc2a83c178bc1c513a7687476aa	I think the Sac kings have the best chance right now because of who they have      i think the deal will be Mike bibby Fransisco Garcia and A draft pick|`|c84bbe4c76cdf35050ccc6f558674b03aa	MINNESOTA STR8UP HIM AND KG WILL BE THE **** CHAMPIONSHIP FOR SURE>.....

Maybe he "bribed" the Warriors' Stephen Jackson to again be sarcastic about the calls so that he would be sent out of the game?    Or if he did "bribe" the refs, it certainly wasn't with money.  He just promised the refs and the NBA that he'll act like a good quiet owner and that we'll see much less  of him on TV.        And the refs were so grateful that maybe it showed in the way they officiated the game.     Whatever.

xOReEw6Waa	The Tikka is a good gun and has some features I really like. Since it is made by Sako, the barrels are great and accuracy is one of the best out of the box. And yes they look and feel good.I currently shoot Browning A-Bolts in 30-06 and 300 WSM and the Tikka comes close to matching up. I did almost buy a Howa Stainless in 270 WSM the other day, another very good gun, and it was only $400.     As for elk caliber, 270 or 270 WSM are the minimums to look at. Lots of elk have been dropped with 270s for a long time. 30-06 is normally the cartridge to go to, it has great power, a good selection of bullet loadings and range enough for normal ethical hunting. You really don't NEED a magnum like a 300 WSM or 300 Win Mag unless you know for certain the range is going to be averaging greater than 200 yards, that would be very open terrain. You could go up to .338 Mag, but again there isn't need for something like that for elk. In Europe they use the 6.5x55 Swede for moose. So I suggest the Tikka in 30-06 with a Nikon or Leupold 3x9 44mm scope with nothing fancy, you don't need mil dots or Bullet Drop Compensation or even Parallax adjustments for hunting elk.  Best thing is being comfortable with your rifle. You will want to shoot the 30-06 a lot more than a Mag any day. 165 or 180 grain BONDED bullets are required. I use 165 for both deer and elk, never have to worry about a 300 yard shot on either. If you buy box ammo you might  need to try more than one brand to find the one your rifle likes.  Best investment of time is to get "The Perfect Shot" for North American Game from the library. It's a great resource.|`|eo3EHDVIaa	There are plenty of good rifle that fit your needs. I would suggest a good bolt action chambered in 7MM Rem Mag as being the best choice of action/caliber. However, since you are a newbie,the recoil is likely to make you flinch. No matter how effective the caliber, a miss is worse than useless as you will likely scare off your prey.    For you I would suggest a 30-06 as the best caliber. It's effective enough and less likely to make you flinch and miss.    If I were you, I'd get together with whoever invited you to go hunting and fire their rifle. Then you will have some frame of reference. Only after selecting the caliber, should you select the rifle to fire it in.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	a place to put bullets    If someone enjoyed killing what disorder might they have?    ANSWER: Having no feelings for others, only yourself is what most serial or enjoyment killers have. It is usually called being a sociopaths or psychopath. Not all of them get their kicks from killing but they do enjoy the power of controlling things, animals people or objects, for their own satisfaction.  You do know, don't you, that most serial killers have a history of animal torture (not hunting or killing for food) and fire setting when young combined with a bed wetting problem.    edit: I can assure Yogi that it is not from a tumor. I interviewed many sociopaths who killed and none had any major medical problems.  Source(s):  retired homicide detective|`|Nb413oN5aa	You shouldn't look in because it might be loaded.... Just Kidding! Seriously it depends on what animal you will be hunting.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Winchester mod 70 or Remington 700. With your inexperience, you don't need a 500 yard tack driver. There are others out there that will suit the bill as well. Check Gunbroker.com and your local pawn shops. When is comes to a bolt action rifle, a used one in good condition should fill your needs nicely. Just put a decent scope on it.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	the Tikka is a fine rifle, but given how little you know about the whole process I'm not sure I would jump in with both feet. Remember, you are going to want to put some glass and mounts on the rifle, which is probably going to run you at least $150 - $250 for a good quality rugged scope and mounts for an elk hunt.    If you figure you still can afford the Tikka, then go with it. However, I would also look at the Savage line with the accu - trigger in 30.-06. Good quality and accurate budget rifles which have been getting excellent ratings and I can vouch that you are going to have a tough time finding a better trigger than the accu-trigger and is a couple of hundred dollars cheaper than the Tikka new.    Thinkingblade|`|YsQQ30YJaa	I liked my old Winchester model 70 30.06 with a Buscnell 4X scope. You want something easy to keep clean and with good fire power for the weight.|`|2TB8p5fvaa	The Winchester Model 70 isn't what it used to be, either get a used Model 70 or a new/used Remington Model 700 .30-06.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Bolt action chambered for .30-06.    I'd avoid the Remington Model 700.    Look for a design with a safety that both blocks the striker (aka firing pin) and locks the bolt.    Winchester Model 70  Kimber Model 8400  Weatherby Mark V  Browning X Bolt (skip BOSS)    Figure on spending another $500 on scope and scope mounts.  Leopold VXIII is best bang for buck.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	The first thing to look for in a rifle is comfort.  As long as the rifle is comfortable and of sufficient caliber for your game, in this case elk.  Any rifle from 6.5x55 through 300 magnum is great for elk.  Just find a rifle that is good for you to shoot.  It doesn't matter a whit whether anyone else, myself or anybody else thinks, you must shoot it, so you must choose it.    I have to say there is no praise for Praise Saitan.  For a former detective not to be able to tell the difference between a serial killer and a hunter, and to make such a comparison is absurd.  Think he has done too many drugs or something.   J|`|t6sDVUI4aa	A really good buy if you are unsure of whether or not you want to get into hunting is the Russian Surplus Mosin Nagants, you can get all the fancy scope mounts and stocks that you want. But out of the box they work and are reliable. I love mine, it is more than accurate enough for hunting purposes and it comes in a caliber similar to the 30-06. At $138.00 on the high end a bargain. It is a bit weak though but it does warrant some examination. You can also get converted mausers that come in many calibers for under your $700 range. CZUSA makes a great gun and there are many that fit your price range. From little .22's al the way up to full size Elephant guns in .500 NE. They also have a unique Single set Trigger that allows you to have a heavier trigger pull, push the trigger forward and you have a hair trigger.   I know you said you want a bolt action but you don't quite know that you will like hunting, and buying a new rifle, is like buying a car drive it off the lot and your lost a lot of your money. The HR/NEF makes single shot rifles in a variety of calibers and as an added benefit you are not locked into one caliber. You can switch the barrels on them easily. They come in 45-70 which will take down any elk. They are accurate and reliable. In hunting you should not need more than one shot. And the price is right around $200 leaving money left over for good optics and ammo for range time and practice.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	A Remington Model 700 with a 2.5X7 variable power scope.*|`|6FlrGqnKaa	hey.    Why does he not have to go for a 500 yard tacker? the way i see it, is if your going to buy a gun, and you are new to the sport, a good gun is a good place to start. because if you look after your rifle, it will outlast you. i am new to shooting, and at 15 i had not alot of money. but i bought the tikka t3 lite stainless in .308.    Tikka t3, good place to start. great rifle, out of box accuracy is also good. my suggestion, get a common caibre. if your only looking to spend that much on a gun, then im guessing your ammo budget is also pretty low. unless your reloading. but ive got a .308 as i said. its a well proven cartridge with a good history.     People complain about the "plastic" parts on a tikka. But they arent just any plastic. its very durable and i have never had any problems. And because they are made by sako, u can be assured of there quality parts.    As you would know investing in a quality scope is a smart move. the magnification, up to you.    But yeah talk to your local shopman and he will point you in the right direction, but if your thinking of a tikka, your heading in the right direction.    (By the way it looks good aswell)              Cheers

Whether this actually works, I don't know. But that's why they hold up the sign.    Good question.|`|47c36bdb80fbcff30a6103e714e2fa56aa	Good Question. I have also been  wondering.

VJuWWgrhaa	first, lets start with leinart. he is not experienced enough to have a breakout year. though he did start half of the games last year, he is not ready to be the next peyton manning this year. i envision that his career will start much like alex smiths career started. he may not be as good as you hoped for, so keep that in mind. the weak schedule may be a slight cushion for him, for fantasy value anyways. but dont expect too much.    denvers defense always seems to break out. though they lost a few key players, denver usually has one of the toughest defenses out there. not big on sacks, interceptions, and fumble recoveries, but they dont give up that many points either. you chose well with the denver D, no need to worry about that position.    brady quinn will start 4 games maximum. he is not going to be a starter unless frye gets injured, then he may have a chance to start more games this year. when he does start, once again dont expect him to be the best QB in the nfl. if you have him on your team, im not sure how valuable he will be down the line.    devin hester will do squat as a receiver. i doubt he will catch more than 100 yards in a game, but he might get 1 or 2 TDs. hes 3rd on the depth chart with a bad quarterback, so he is not promising as a receiver. though he is a good kick returner, i dont think he will get more than 50 points this year.    with what i know, your team will be ok this year. there are still some question marks surrounding leinart, hester, and quinn. but if leinart has a decent year, that might be good enough for you. hopefully hester is on your bench, and not starting. if you have hester as a starting wideout, that may be trouble. hes good for when one of your better WRs is on a bye week or is injured. sounds like edgerrin james and fitzgerald will have a somewhat good season together. just wait it out and see how you do throughout the season. good luck to you!|`|nE7NwbDdaa	so u have all these players? u r screwed when the cards have a bye. i like the risk and i think all of them will have great years but I dont think you'll make ur fantasy playoffs.  Odds of Leinart 2/1    Denver's Defense 10/1    Brady Quinn 2/1    Devin Hester 12/1 Great returner not sure about WR    Ur team 1/10 Good team and great risk but u still wont get as many points as others.

VjToW5MBaa	49ers... last year was the beginning of the return to form of the early 90's- the offense is scoring more and the defense is giving up fewer points    this year: 7 or 8 wins    next year: 10 wins|`|DsaYaIsGaa	Arizona. They totally demolished our Bills last week. Maybe it's their time. Warner is a great quarterback and they have the toughness now with that new coach from Pittsburgh.|`|jDOv2TSeaa	Nobody deserves it, but Arizona will win it.|`|rUhyDm5faa	oh lord. right now, the best strategy is to always bet against the NFC west. always. but seeing as one of them has to win..   don't count seattle out yet. each of the last three years, experts start saying arizona or san fran is gonna take it, but let's not forget seattle has won the division the last four years in a row. and made it past the first round of the playoffs the last two. yea, they are off to a pretty bad start. but they just got their receivers back, julius jones has looked legit, and the defense is not half as bad as eli made it look. the giants game was - awful. but seattle is notoriously horrible when traveling to the east coast. and the giants are playing an extremely high quality of football. this week, if the hawks step up and take care of green bay at home, you can't count them out of the division yet. i mean, it's so horrible. you truly could win it with 7 wins.   if seattle continues to suck these next few weeks, arizona has the best shot. warner is playing consistently and the receiving tandem is one of the best playing right now. or, if not, the best by far in the NFC west.   as for san fran, they look much better this year, but they're still not quite there. and st. louis is going to have enough trouble eeking out a few wins, let alone somehow taking the division, as pathetic as it is. |`|l2GDkG7Aaa	itll be between niners and cardinals. that division is pathetic.|`|4H3zT1dsaa	Arizona by default.|`|cEIIHXUuaa	ARIzONa, THE Birds|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	49ers...arizona is a fluke|`|ggBfHk1waa	Looks like Arizona is the least awful of the bunch.

St. Louis 2nd worst team in the league ahead of only the Detroit Lions. Seattle is horrible losing 44-3 against the Giants. And don't expect San Fran to win many games. |`|GkShK7JZaa	Looks to me like Arizona is the best team in the NFC West.  The others kinda smell right now.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	Does it matter? The winner will get bounced in the first round of the playoffs anyway.|`|gwuzoIrhaa	Seattle is a mess right now.

Dropping 35 points each game they are clearly going to be the winner of this division. |`|fJd2J19faa	The cardinals are the best of the worst.The eagles should join. They are a last place team in the east. They would be a run away winner in that crummy division.|`|Vwkuf13maa	Seattle will settle down now that Engram and Branch are back.  J. Jones is establishing himself as a pretty good RB. They're defense will step up and quit getting blown away.

a6ce942f66f43d4426f68929c5ed8276aa	No, the 64lbs. is wrong!    It would mean to string it at 59lbs. Your range is 50 - 60 which would mean 55 is the most typical stringing tension. The +4 in your case is recommending it be strung at a tension 4 more than the typical tension. Racquet manufacturers would NEVER recommend you to string outside of the tension range. It could cause the racquet to break and they would not be at fault. Often though, the pros will string outside of the range but their racquets usually only need to last one match.|`|672b52268291581dd2a551a0aed78dfaaa	64|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	it means 64...|`|DcqENVenaa	it means 59 cuz 55 is the average between 50 and 60 and u want +4 to that  |`|BtSFRoZfaa	The average tension would be 55 because that's halfway between 50 and 60. So the recommended range would be between 51 and 59, because that is + and - 4.     The tighter you string the racquet, the more control you'll get, but the less power.    Obviously, if you string it looser, you'll get more power but less control.    Since you're a guy, you can probably put your own pace on the ball, so I would get it strung tighter, probably around 60, because then you can really kill the ball and not sacrifice any control.    But don't go out of the recommended range because it will put stress on your racquet and likely break it.    I hope that helped!
vQz0DLtFaa	Lesnar needs to learn how to finish fights. So many times during the Herring fight anyone with basic BJJ skills would have been able to get a submission in. He's one of the strongest and fastest heavyweights around, it's a shame to see that not put into BJJ as that could make him unstoppable. Bottom line is that Couture has only won two of his fights by submission, and a number of his losses have been due to submission indicating that he may rely on strength or speed against Lesnar, if this is the case he may be in trouble, it's going to be an awesome fight.|`|3bEXhkFpaa	couture because lesnar has no experience.

7XXTxFUmaa	If you don't have the game I highly recommend it.  I have to say one of the best things is walking around and moving objects. Ther is also double the amount of tricks. You can do handplants and footplants. You can also skitch. I dont remember if there was a San Vanalona sign like hollywood in the first but in this one you can go ontop of it and drop in off of it.  The Hall of meat mode is also really really cool. There is a list of challenges you get at the beginning of the game and you can complete them at any time. You have to things like break 10 bones in your body or get this many body damage points. also you can move your body in the air. You can go from a cannon ball to your legs and arms spread completely apart to a jump kick looking thing.    There is pretty much nothing that I don't like but the graphics are not as good as the first. but you dont even notice it after a little bit|`|pG2hQOqVaa	everything good about it. u can do alot of new tricks and theres new brands if u dont have it u have to get it. theres nothing bad about it.|`|evEJxv06aa	to find out whats worst or good about skate2 go to games trailers.com they will show the good and bad parts of The skate2 ok.

apY85Qmtaa	Decent pickup for the Bucks. We need someone to play SG...currently we are playing Sessions at the 2 with Ridnour at the 1 so this is actually decent for us.    Lue should be a serviceable PG for the Magic while Jameer is gone.|`|bYv4EtbUaa	Orlando would come out on top-keith bogans isnt a very skilled player, while Lue is a half-decent guard who can make open shots and can drive.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	i don't think that Lue is a guy that you can win with starting at point guard, especially in the playoffs.  his defense stinks and is average on the other end.  If I were the magic I would contact the Bulls about Kirk Hinrich.  Kirk has been playing point guard since he came into the leauge as more of a facilitator than a guy that looks for his own shot first.  This is exactly what the magic need with Howard down low and Hedo and Rashard on the perimeter.  Not to mention that Kirk is a good defensive player (and defense wins in the playoffs), he has always played guys like D Wade tough on the defensive end.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	And its because Bogans isnt needed anymore considering the improvement in Courtney Lee and JJ Reddick and they also have pietrus so they dont need Bogans regardless.  Its a good move because they need a Pg who can knock down shots and Lue is good at just that cause Nelson might be out for season|`|BIyJUmM9aa	Well if the Magic need a PG that can knock down shots, that T-Lue is the guy to get.  Either way  think its a good trade for the Magic    =]]|`|dDhTMacAaa	it has happened and I love the deal for Orlando.    Not only is Lue a solid fill-in, but a darn good backup when/if Jameer returns.    I saw Lue in Dallas as a second-half (of the season) backup, and he had sretches where he just couldn't miss. He isn't a popular player or a "star," or even a great player, but he's a solid role player and this also opens the door for...yep...    JJ!    Reddick will get another fine chance to shine and I expect rookie Courtney Lee to continue to do so as well.|`|tuoUkfF8aa	I think this is a good trade for both teams. Considering the Magic just lost Nelson at Point and the Bucks lost Redd at SG, both of these guys can fill in some of those minutes.|`|a9b98318350219f8c9859b49ea5c5dfaaa	Who is keith bogans? Completely replacable for the magic as they have J.J. Redick who they still do not know how to use. They dont want to play fulltime with Anthony Johnson, because he is Anthony Johnson. He is really underratted tho. lue brings good leadership and is the new jim jackson going from team to team. He wont bring to many assists but he wont bring many turnovers either. Bucks  probably doing this for some type of salary implication (I'm guessing). With bogut and Redd gone their 8th spot in the eastern conference is good as gone. Bogans will try to push up their scoring some but he will not be enough.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	It was needed for Orlando. They needed a point guard now that Jameer Nelson is out, when you look at their roster the Magic have a log jam at SG, and Keith was not having an overly great season anyway so he was the odd man out.    Milwaukee did it for size, with Michael Redd out the Bucks don't have anyone over 6'3" capable of playing SG. Sessions is a point guard and is too small.    One good thing comes out of this, it will give J.J. Redick a chance to play more now that he moves up in the rotation.|`|FdnOt9psaa	Im from Wisconsin. With Redd Bogut and Ridnour gone, Bucks need replacements at every position except SF and PG. This is Ramon Sessions time to shine, and Richard Jefferson is fine. So Bucks need all the help they can get. Lue will also help Magic, as if they arent good enough already.
wSq80V1xaa	50 point triple double.

That's a no brainer! Every basketball expert would agree that Lebron definitely had a better game. I could concede that Kobe has a better scoring game but, Lebron top Kobe w/ a better all around game! Kobe was just concerned on scoring the whole night on that game. While Lebron's play was still multi-dimensional. If you would factor in the assists Lebron made and multiply that 2 pts then, it sum up to 72 pts againts Kobe's 67! Do you all understand now? I suppose those people who still believe Kobe has a better game are ignorant of true team game of basketball. I would take Lebron's game anytime!    Heck, even Jordan can score 61 pts any given night but, he won't have 0 rebounds and lesser assists in a game unlike Kobe. So, stop hattin you Kobe lovers! Don't be blinded anymore! Time to realize that we are now living in James World of Basketball! Lebron 4 MVP '09!|`|VKhfrKP6aa	The triple double is so rare, lebron couldn't even do it, the last rebound belonged to Wallace.

So if Kobe played eight or nine more minutes its conceivable he would have easily  dropped 75 pts. Would you whiners still say the say thing? I'm sure you would. People these days   remember point totals not assists and rebounds. Must suck to be a hater.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Kobe broke Jordan's record that lasted for 13 years.    LeBron did something that hasn't been done in 34 years, and it doesn't have anything to do with a stadium.|`|bYv4EtbUaa	history has shown that its harder to achieve a 50 point triple double.

AA10068004	I agree with you on offering more protection and the concern over visors.     Was the article saying if they took them off themselves or does it include if they just come off (kind of like the good ole Rob Ray rule and jerseys)?     If helmet just coming off ends up included in the rule then I think it would be an impossible thing for the NHL to enforce. Especially the part of linesmen jumoing in ASAP. More often than not you see linesmen stand back until the players tire (or tie each other up and stop swinging) or hit the ground. One of the reasons they do that is to avoid getting hit/hurt trying to break up a fight. I am not sure how they could stop a fight in the middle of full blows, especially when one good punch causes a player to loose his helmet, as they are swinging away. I doubt the players are suddenly going to be gentlemen and stop punching because a helmet came off. The NHL knows this as well.    Being that this would be very difficult to enforce as is... I would bet if it becomes a rule it will first be developed with stiffer penalties included that would punish players/coaches enough to the point that they think twice before fighting, like automatic game misconducts, suspensions, fines to coaches, etc. I think the NHL is trying to find a way to eliminate fighting from the game without looking like the bad guy to fans but rather find a way to let it phase itself out.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I agree Its word by word Detail on what happened, a bad Thing NO Did someone get hurt YES Taking off your Helmet does create Injury during a Fight, Head Trauma Doesn't need any Drama.|`|YajYjjxLaa	yeah, visors would be a problem. that would suck to watch a player fight with that on, its not as fun to watch.

BQ: i have to say Al Snow, only one that comes to mind that was bad.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	He has always been a motormouth, but he isn't getting a gig anytime soon on cable...his ratings would make John McEnroe's look spectacular. He has a niche market and that is it.    His columns are interesting, but sometimes have more of a feel of Dick Morris talking politics; sounds great until you take a second look and you see the takes could have been provided by many outsiders who have an insider's knowledge.     Meltzer remains the gold standard in editorializing/reporting on the business.     Heyman is always working angles and he's probably searching for a mark in Europe to get a new company rolling. He can't do anything in the USA/Canada...not with the trail he left with some banks, vendors and talent.    Mooney and Adamle - and a few others - were the company's attempt to make the product appear to be media-mainstream, with an "outside" journalist doing the reporting. They failed because the business is not set up for this and fans essentially refused to buy into the gimmick. If Vince goes this route again, he might as well also bring back the WBF.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Isn't he writing for a UK paper as well?

XLXncQu9aa	I think David Tyree is an exceptional individual, however he played a great role in the Giants offense during the super bowl against the Patriots.  In my mind he doesn't have to do anything else at this point of his career.  Not only did he win a championship, but his play was the one that sealed the deal for the Giants.  Had he not made such a great catch the Giants would have lost and the Patriots would have went undefeated.  If Tyree never does anything else on the field, he will be remembered for that catch.  I could care less what else he does, had he not made that catch it would have been horrible to witness the Patriots winning another super bowl.  So if he does nothing else, it won't matter.  His catch is already being mentioned as one of the greatest plays of super bowl history, what else do you need?|`|tNerdFYsaa	No and No. He got lucky on the catch in the superbowl. Yeah it was a great catch and it meant so much, maybe even the best in the superbowl ever. But that was a one time deal and he will probably not catch more than 40 balls the rest of his career, but it won't matter, that catch meant everything|`|DRPhJnXzaa	No and No|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Not yet, but he is rather young.  Playing behind Plaxico Burress and Steve Smith, and being injured last year didn't help him.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	i have the feeling his career is pretty much over|`|JKIWCgbUaa	no he made one big play and that is good enough for him|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	No he will not and if he does no it will not matter at all. He will be like so many other one hit wonders that have a great moment in their careers and then disappear into obscurity. If you don't believe me look up a wide reciever named Freddie Mitchell that played for the Eagles like 3-5 years ago. He caught a outstanding pass on 3rd and like 30 from Mcnabb that got them into the NFC Championship game where they lost. Freddie Mtichel was never heard from again.(Thank God)|`|6J5mQWj0aa	keep dreaming|`|ZrmkDXGQaa	"No he will not and if he does no it will not matter at all.

But Lebron was the one who actually had possesion of the ball anyway so it would either be a team rebound or go to LBJ. I hear Wallace was ****** all game tho they didnt count his tip ins. I didnt get to see 1st hand because I do not have satellite at school *Tear*|`|bU2rGQHSaa	Wallace clearly didn't have possession therefore it is not a rebound, he tipped it and Lebron took possession.  Lebron is credited with the rebound...earns a triple-double...end of story whether anyone likes it or not!|`|aUGM3ju6aa	He did get a triple double. Stop crying.|`|FUoKu13Daa	lol, man,  maybe you should find a way to say he did not get 52 points or maybe 2 of his assist were questionable,    regardless, even if it was not a triple double those stats were pretty impressive no matter if you are a cavs fan or not.    I am just saying give the man his prop  for a great game, no matter what you or I think he got the triple double and that is that,      2 great player came into MSG and had 2 great game and we should all just leave it as that.    The only people who will not give LBJ credit for his game are people who are Kobe's fan who deep down think LBJ game were more impressive,  If they thought Kobe game were more impressive then they would not be questioning 1 rebound or take away that LBJ had a great game too.|`|eAFbIiWWaa	i agree i think he just stole it off Wallace. But that's what most basketball players think off, records.|`|eX3CJXhmaa	What are you "6" ? LeBron had a better game than Kobe did so deal with it. You're embarrassing yourself!|`|cqRBSDzvaa	Buddy Wallace never had control of the ball.Lebron did.stop making excuses.Lebron had a triple double
jwm0kQvNaa	I've been saying this for a while.  Trade down, pick up someone like Michael Ohr (sp?) and gain at least one more first day pick.  Plug him in at LT, move Backus to OG, or trade him for another pick.  They could keep Culpepper for another year or two, until the QB they draft in '10 (whoever it may be) is ready.  They have so many holes, they need the picks.    Of course, this being Detroit, they'll want to relive The Joey Harrington Tour all over.  Take a good QB and kill his career before it really takes off.  Yay!|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	An O-Lineman.  But open competition for their starting QB next year.  I think Orlovsky should be starting.|`|0TAld46gaa	They should trade teh number one pick  and try and get as many picks as possible.  Team needs alot of help|`|f7qVtYfaaa	trade down! there are some very very good linemen in this draft, trade that pick and take your chances building your team up. this qb class doesn't look impressive,maybe more alex smiths than ryan/flaccos so why risk it just because everyone says you need a qb, you have more holes than just that position.|`|wSq80V1xaa	The Lions should be looking for a QB rather than a OL.  A good quarterback can still make plays with a crappy offensive line, but a great offensive line means nothing without a good quarterback.  And I would not trust Culpepper or Orlovsky to run my team.  Matthew Stafford is a good quarterback, and would fit that team.  I think they shoud also think about Mark Sanchez.|`|7GHkeHZpaa	It's hard to say... they could probably take a lineman and finish 1-15 at best next year and then get the  1 again and take Tebow,,,    But I don't think that's really a good way to present your franchise though and Stafford is a beast. So I'd take him now. Culpepper is a bum anyways..|`|KnY8HXtPaa	They need more than just an o-line. Stafford is not the QB you want if you have the first pick. I think they should stick with orlovsky for next year and try to get philip rivers in free agency or draft sam bradford or colt mccoy|`|HaVtDEBvaa	**** the lions...i don't think that anyone will make the impact that they need in the long run right now|`|wbIEau0qaa	they'll draft a wide receiver... michael crabtree|`|tVEm2eJXaa	I think that the Lions should take Andre Smith with the first pick so they can improve their offensive line so that the QB's won't have to rush to get the ball out and have some time to look down the field for a open wide receiver. Then with the 20th pick they should either take a QB like Josh Freeman, or take another position and wait for another year so they could draft a QB like Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow, or Colt McCoy. The reason why I think that is because I think that Matthew Stafford will be a JaMarcus Russell, a quarterback that's taken first overall and their only good attribute is just their big arm, without being an accurate quarterback.|`|UADHt07Zaa	They should try to trade the top pick for more picks.  Then they need to stock up on good defensive players and get two good guards for the line.  They don't need a quarterback as badly as they need everything else.  Orlovski will be just fine for them next year (I never thought Culpepper was a good quarterback before the injury).|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Trade the Pick to the Jets or another team that need a QB, the Lions need a OT not a QB.|`|jwQPWl5Haa	Matthew Stafford is the next Joey Harrington. If they draft a QB first they should get Mark Sanchez from USC.     If they have any takers, they should trade their pick and get more draft picks and maybe a veteran or two.|`|ByTiBt1waa	draft him|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	They do not need a rookie qb to run that team. A rookie qb needs a team that can get him hot quick. If a rookie qb is on the lions he would never gain any confidence and would struggle. They need a qb that will stick it out for at least long enough to get them at least to 5-6 wins a season for 2-3 years then build on that. Daunte should stay and they should pick up an O line men|`|ePeKSqrIaa	they need to get an o linemen because you win the game up front. Dano can lead the team until they can find a QB that is ready to lead them. maybe get QB later in the draft if a good one is available|`|v3Xbsktdaa	What good is a quality qb if he is going to get killed? Build the o-line, get by with a marginal qb until you have some talent around him first.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I'm not sure what the Lions are going to do since they are such a mess. Since guys from the Matt Millen-era are still in the front office, a WR draft pick would not surprise me.
eNt9C860aa	O-Line... Take an O-line with at least the  1 pick and maybe even their second pick.  It's the one position they really need to address hardcore this offseason.  They can get a decent  2 receiver behind Johnson later in the draft, they're good at RB.  There should be quite a few decent QBs to pick up in FA (they won't be long term solutions but they'll last a season or 2) such as Cassell, Derek Anderson, and maybe even a Kerry Collins if Tennessee doesn't want to make him a starter.    As far as a trade, the crop doesn't seem that outstanding this year so there won't be too many teams trying to jump up just because I don't see that many stand out players like in years past so the idea of trading down for a lot isn't going to be a very viable option for them.    They could also look at the D-line a lot and try to get someone who can get good pressure on the QB, but I think O-line is a greater concern for them atm.    Overall, they need to draft on the lines.|`|tVEm2eJXaa	With their first pick they should take OT Andre Smith. With the 20th pick they should take QB Josh Freeman, or take another position and wait another year to draft a QB like Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow, or Colt McCoy.|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	trade it away|`|wSq80V1xaa	I agree with you.  I would trade one pick for maybe a quarterback, and maybe one other draft pick.  I haven't heard much talk about it, but if I were Detroit, I would be VERY interested in Matt Cassel.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	I would defintely trade the  1 pick to get a couple more early round picks, at least one more 1st round and 2 more 2nd round.  Next, petition the league to require Ford to sell the team to a competent owner.  Then, trade for or buy a good free agent QB (Culpepper sucks).|`|KnY8HXtPaa	they should take mark sanchez with the  1 pick and take William Beatty or Cody Brown with the  20 pick.|`|A1w0nk3Naa	this is to Brandon M. They wont take Matt Cassel because as dumb as i think this is Patriots are going to franchise tag him so Patriots will have him again so no chance of the Lions getting him|`|UADHt07Zaa	Try to trade the number one pick and choose James Laurinaitis with the second pick.|`|4Pe8yZnuaa	I agree.  I would trade both for multiple picks.  They need a lot of help. More help than two over paid 1st rounders can supply.|`|JKIWCgbUaa	i would use it and pick nola|`|AA10380060	they should petition the NFL to re-institute the future draft rule in which they could draft a player who is still in school, then take Michael Crabtree first, with the second take Laurinitis then with the future pick take Colt McCoy, sure they would have to wait a year but is there a better QB in this year's draft? I think not.|`|piM3bj9Gaa	I would try and trade down from  1.  If I cant do that, I'd pick a o-lineman.  A d-line guy for the 2nd round pick.  The lions have some skill position players but stink in the trenches.  fix the trenches, and their in business.|`|iMGSaC0qaa	I didn't know they had two first round picks. Unless you rtalking about the first pick of the second round. I agree with trading the first overall pick away. That is usually a disaster. Trade with someone who is between 10-15 and get their first and a second or third.

Triple Double is possible though, but not with 50 points.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	lol @ Paul Pierce being in the same category as LeBron and Kobe.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	He sure did steal that rebound and you know why? He wanted to outdo Kobe to keep his name fresh in the minds of the MVP voters.|`|FUoKu13Daa	maybe you should watch the game and try and find out if all his baskets should counts or that 2 of his assist should not be assists,    The game is over and he got the most impressive triple double not only at the Garden but NBA history in over 30 yrs,    So when you tell your grandchildren when It happens again in 30 years you can tell them you remember the last one,    Like I said before the only people that are up in arm about this is the people who are Kobe fans and they deep down felt that  LBJ stats were more impressive , if they thought Kobe stats were more impressive then they would not be going on this witch hunt.|`|eAFbIiWWaa	i totally agree.

eo3EHDVIaa	It sounds psychosomatic to me. Sure, seals eat a lot of shellfish, but I doubt that some essence of the shellfish oozes from the boots after processing into usable fur. There might be some trace of shellfish in the meat. Still, any amount of shellfish traces that remains in the meat would be so small that she would have to be incredibly allergic to have any effect.    Try feeding her a seal free venison stew and afterward mention that it had some seal in it for flavor. If she reacts retroactively, it's all in her head.      Wearing a renewable resource like fur is OK anyplace cold, unless you are living in the Disney version of reality where cute little animals talk.|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Only a doctor would be able to diagnose that.|`|AA11729094	It sounds like to me she's a tree hugger type and her "allergic reaction" is her way of protesting your diet or boots.

Ignore her if possible, if she keeps up with her complaining, take it up with management.|`|AA11694178	Many people who are allergic to seafood, are actually allergic to the iodine in the seafood.

However, in all fairness to her, it is certainly possible to have more than one allergy. She could be allergic to both shellfish and seals, and out of ignorance, she just doesn't realize that they are different allergies.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Here is what I would do...    Go buy a "Fake" pair made of cow hide or something.    Then when she bitches, call her out on it.    The allergy she has is to the idea of seal skin boots.    Leather is Leather, Seal Skin boots are made of Seal Leather    So if she is complaining about an allergy to leather tell her to go change her shoes as they are leather.    Or    Make her prove her allergy and tell your boss that she is forcing her political views on it and you would like him/her to put and end to it.    Or    File suit against her for harassment and a violation of your first amendment rights. You have the right to whear what you want as long as it falls within the law.|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	I am allergic to shellfish. Crustaceans only, not mollusks. Oysters and calms and anything like that is fine.  So shrimp, crabs, lobster, even crayfish are deadly to me if i eat them, But there are expections.  I can touch them if they are cooked, just cant eat them.  I can touch them uncooked for short periods of time, i can eat crab if its in crab cakes, and i can have some amounts of king crab legs, but not the body meat.  I bet youre wondering how i found all this out... its called trial and error, and loving eppy shots.  The only way she could be allergic to your boots would be the same way she would be allergic to a dog, and it would make her sneeze and get stuffy, but only if the seal boots were still alive.... shes full of it.  There is no way her being allergic to shellfish would have any affects on her.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I doubt the seal would set off a reaction. Although seals do eat seafood so who knows... but I think the likely hood of seal meat causing a reaction would be pretty low.     Seal skin shouldn't cause any reaction. the fur is even known to not cause reactions in people with fur allergies. It's not fully hypoallergetic but people ( myself included) who have allergies to fur don't have the same reaction to seal.
tRcO5uyiaa	YES! and yes.    I thought I was the only one who missed the home team white jerseys! Yay for you! My husband told me that yes, they switched to get the sales going on the colour jerseys at home as well as away.|`|qAlrpec0aa	Well, a while ago, the guys from Killer Jerseys had an online petition to get the whites back to being home, and darks away again! These guys said that it was due to RBK coming in and taking a new marketing approach in order to sell the jerseys better. I'm not sure if it's on there anymore, but I signed it!|`|AA11341587	I'm sort of mixed.  Watching on TV I still will instinctively think the Home team is in white.  However, go to a game and everyone wears the dark jerseys.  I own more dark jerseys.  And it's always been more dark jerseys in the crowd, so I agree that marketing is why they changed.  So on the pro side, if wearing a jersey is trying to be part of the team, yet the crowd wants to wear the dark jersey, then it makes sense that the team be wearing the same.|`|mcE9C06Saa	I liked when they wore white ones at home. "PITTSBURGH PENGUINS  1 FAN" you are incorrect.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	You know I was pissed when they made the switch. I didn't like that they were messing with tradition, but you know what?? Most people would buy the Road jersey anyway, me included ( My first B's jersey was Moog 35, in Black). So now I've gotten used to it and it's not really that big of a deal.     Most NFL teams wear colored home jerseys with the exception of Miami and Washington, I think? Not to sure aboot any others. So I'm sure it was just a marketing strategy for the NHL.|`|F934e4HQaa	the home team picks what color they wear then the away team wears the opposite color|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	I hockey history. The home team wore dark since the beginning. Then they changed it . Now they have gone back to they was it was the first time. I happen to like home darks. A main reason for the switch back is that dark jerseys and thirds which tend to be darks sell and were selling better. So it was two sided why they went back to home darks. But mostly for the jersey selling aspect|`|2iuZdBXraa	I grew up when the home teams wore the dark uniforms but I like the Leafs white jerseys better.

czNUMFdWaa	The two most cost effective ways to find out would be to go to a center that utilizes the C.A.T.S system (which is easier said than done) or get a lesson from a Certified Coach that uses BolwersMap or MotionView.  These video analysis programs can calculate revs, speed, etc.  I suppose you could also video tape your ball with a piece of white tape extending right of the finger holes (if you're a righty) and calculate it out but that's a pain.    The lesson will run you between 45.00 to 80.00 depending on the coach.  For example, I charge 60.00.  It's a worthwhile investment and that coach will be able to help you determine if those adjustments are working or not and also give you some other ideas on how you can increase rev rate.    Best of Luck!    You can find coaches at www.bowl.com|`|obPSaYf3aa	Check to see if the "Kegel" Center (address below), may be able to assist you with your question.  I took a 3 day training camp for all levels of players.  Training will be done both in a classroom and on lane setting.  Each student will receive an individualized practice session with a take home DVD to review after the training.  The cost for the camp was around $700, but I had to foot the bill for my airfare from California and lodging.

Tony Gwynn  8. George Brett  7. Ty Cobb  6. Ted Williams  5. Roberto Clemente  4. Nolan Ryan  3. Mickey Mantle  2. Willie Mays  1. Babe Ruth    That's my opinion, but the only thing that isn't disputable is the Babe at  1 because of his abilities as a pitcher and hitter.|`|5xIroQjMaa	1) Willie Mays  2) Mickey Mantle  3) Barry Bonds  4) Pete Rose  5) Johnny Bench  6) Ted Williams  7) Roberto Clemente  8) Ichiro   9) Albert Pujols  10) Alex Rodriguez    The last three are active players, but I believe when their career is over, they will be easily at that place or higher on the list. And I didn't include anyone before 1950 because let's be honest, the game of baseball is a joke compared to the modern day game. Honestly, I have a hard time stretching back pre-1975, but some of those players were just too good not to be included.|`|ozVqauMXaa	Without thinking too hard, so the order is not perfect(also just position players, pitchers I think are impossible to effectively rank, what with the deadball era, etc)..Ruth, DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bonds (he was awesome even before the roids), Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Rickey Henderson, Mantle, Stan Musial, and Gehrig.  Pujols and A-Rod may eventually earn their way onto the list.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	Bob Gibson may have been the best pitcher, but he did pitch on the 15" mound.    Believe it or not, but, Arod may have most of the batting records before he retires|`|6826faa24e7136054b7f73bfa7839087aa	Here is my ten top players:  Honus Wagner  Ty Cobb  Babe Ruth  Josh Gibson  Ted Williams  Stan Musial  Jackie Robinson  Mickey Mantle  Willie Mays  Barry Bonds|`|RE7nFT7Taa	If A-rod stays healthy he will be the best|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Assuming we're talking about position players... and assuming we eliminate guys from the steroids era (bonds, mcgwire, sosa, etc...):    1. Babe Ruth - He hit more home runs then the rest of the AL combined when he hit 60. His lifetime BA is ridiculous (not just power) and if he remained a pitcher he'd likely be a hall of famer for that (sub 3 ERA). Clearly  1 in stats, comparisons and personality.    2. Willie Mays- All around 5 tool dominator. I can see the argument for  1, but I give Ruth the edge for the pitching prowess.    3. Hank Aaron- A monster of a hitter, dominating. Not a bad fielder either and the all time HR king (*cough* sorry Barry)    4. Ted Williams- Also maybe best pure hitter, you wonder what his stats would be if it werent for the war. Best lefty ever.    5. Joe DiMaggio- Same as Williams, except right handed. (you could probably say the 2 are tied, if not for their hand preference)    6. Ty Cobb- I hate putting this racist jerk so high, but the "Georgia Peach" was mean and a helluva player. Maybe best pure hitter and an unbelievable base stealer.    7. Mickey Mantle- Awesome hitter and fielder. He's on this list for pure skill and determination, if his health didnt fail him he'd perhaps be higher.    8. Lou Gherig- The "Iron Horse" needs little introduction. A true gamer and sweet hitter, for average and power. The luckiest guy, for sure.    9. Pete Rose- All time hits leader, 'nuff said.    10. Rickey Henderson- Would create chaos at the top of any lineup in any time, any era, against any pitcher. Opposing teams HATED him and for good reason... speed, power and an all-time eye (high walk and HBP totals).    Honorable mention: Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. I dont include them because their careers in MLB were essentially non-existant (through no fault of their own). But if they played full MLB careers, its possible they'd be  1 for hitters and pitchers respectively.    Barry Bond would make this list if not for the controversies around his performance enhancement.

I tried to spread my choices around. I didnt want two players on the same team at the same time ie Mickey Mantle, Lou Gerhig. Mantle and Dimaggio where on the same team for one year.

cNIQ9xs6aa	Great trade for both teams......Detroit wanted to clear salary and with Iverson it either works this year and they re-sign him or they clear about $15,000,000 in cap space (and more if they don't sign R Wallace) to make a run at Lebron (they will still have Prince, Stuckey and Hamilton).......Denver got a great player in Billups and he's got the team playing great basketball and he's still hitting the big shots.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	no way man. Do you see how hard it is for AI, Rip, and Stuckey to be in a proper rotation. AI is a scorer and the game stops when the ball gets in his hand. Pistons are built to be a team that moves around the ball.     Bottom line they would have been better off just giving away chancey billups and just getting back a minor player in return with some other things like money and draft picks. AI Is amazing but just messed up the entire pistons roster and their play|`|SKsSRO3Caa	I think it is a good trade for both teams. The Detroit Pistons got to the Eastern Conferance Finals 6 times in a row and werent getting anywhere. The Nuggets got eliminated in the first round playoffs twice while Iverson was there. It was time for change in both teams.|`|EcCmhdvKaa	Good for the Nuggets    Bad for the Piston.    That explains all.    Now give me my points.|`|aSE076PZaa	that was a good trade,iverson suxs.his a ball hogg.  billups is  a team player.if Kmartin is playin good  C.Anthony playing good that team is goin 2 be really good|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Nobody can really tell until the playoffs to be honest|`|bYv4EtbUaa	well, it was a game changer for the nuggets, considering they have had a complete turnaround and got a third-ballot hall of famer who can still play well. on paper the trade looked really good for the pistons too, who got a first ballot future hall of famer, but unfortunately Iverson is taking a long time to mesh and has somewhat disrupted the already fragile chemistry of the pistons lineup (rip hamilton is complaining about being benched). Additionally, he has only really added decent scoring and hasnt been great so far. So all in all, bad trade for the pistons, but a steal for the nuggets.|`|jAqVoGlmaa	horrible trade... the demise of that franchise starts in coaching...|`|lP9kQmRraa	Hell no!

wrhqkEiMaa	As mentioned above they look at who scored the most goals, if that is equal then they look at their head-to-head record, if they drew their game earlier in the tournament, then the winner is decided by drawing of lots, but if it is the last game of the group stages and the two teams draw, they will probably go to extra time and penalty shootouts as it almost happened in EURO 08.|`|PLWdgGNeaa	Basically, a similar thing happened last year's Euros, in the group with Turkey and Czech Republic where they had same goal difference and points and if their match ended in a draw it would have gone into a penalty shoot out. (Would have been the first ever penalty shootout in a group stage match!!)|`|iRaVPifQaa	It goes to whoever scored the most goals out of both of the teams. If they both scored the same amount of goals, I'm not sure what FIFA would do to be honest.|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the above answer.
AA11619477	If you work on increasing your mileage, you should be able to reduce your time greatly. Work on expanding your endurance. Best bet is to run 5-6 days a week (4 miles or more each day to begin) and increase your mileage every 12-14 days and do a long run every 8 days (should be 2 miles longer than your regular run). If you do that and stay healthy, you should be able to run faster than 18:30. Find hills in your area and do some runs on them too to further develop your endurance. Also if you are to do some workouts where you focus on running 1 mile at 6:10 pace or faster with rests in between, you can further hone your pacing skills and most definitely improve. Good Luck!|`|tLHDC1uIaa	If you put work into it, honestly, you can do whatever you want.  you should easily be able to beat it if you want it bad enough.|`|DvEpetxOaa	Yes, but remember cross country is not only about the amount of miles you run or how high the hill you climbed is. It is also a matter of have abs and muscles in your arms and legs. The more arm muscle you have the harder you can drive your arms which will make you go faster. Also you should try bulking up on carbs! Another great exercise is standing flat on the floor and then jumping onto a box (something that will support your Weight) with dumbbells held in the curl position. Also you should still run every week try to increase your mileage by a mile. Have fun cross country is a great sport if you need more tips email me sporty.samz@gmail.com|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I think if you train a lot, you would break until it reaches 18:30. If you were at 21:11, you can have a better chance to be able to break to 18:30 by the next cross season.|`|MfxHpLVWaa	cutting that much time would be one hel1 of a challenge... I run usually between 20-21 minutes. If I could cut that much time off that quick I would honestly consider it a miracle... it is possible, but kind of unlikely.

auW4Kwxcaa	you can hand it to him after u turn around n try to trick the defense|`|lN9jcKYhaa	The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backwards to a player behind the line of scrimmage (i.e. in the "backfield"). The ball may be handed, thrown, or even rolled, and its trajectory and the ball during that passage are called "the snap". The ball is almost always sent between the snapper's legs, but only in Canadian football is that required. Additional rules apply regarding the positioning and stance of the snapper as one of several "line" players in anticipation of the snap.  In most American football codes it is legal and possible for the snapper to roll or slide a snap backward along the ground and, with the ball now in play as a fumble (and a backward one at that), step back, pick the ball up and play it as if he were the quarterback. This has a hidden advantage in that it allows the actual quarterback, who would normally pass the ball, to act as an additional eligible receiver.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes - the ball can be "snapped" by simply picking it up and running, or by picking it up and tossing it back to the quarterback, etc.|`|4njUhNl5aa	i wouldnt see the point of that|`|ZKyqU6RDaa	Not sure, but if you snap it sideways your gonna get drilled. If you snap through yur legs you can get up fast enough to block.|`|n6DcjcmLaa	yes|`|5msDR7hZaa	yes|`|3m9DQuDRaa	If you mean snap it by handing it off to someone NOT the Center for the snap, then no.  But the snap can be set straight to the Halfback or Fullback (making the Quarterback an eligible receiver in the process).  The requirement of the "snap" is that it goes to someone BEHIND the line of scrimmage.  Anything to the sides is illegal.    An exception to this is, of course, the intentional fumble...  basically the center can "snap" the ball by rolling it behind him, so a lineman can break the line and scoop the ball...  it's not an intelligent play, but it's been done on college fields before.  The most common is the "snap option" play where the center snaps the ball to the halfback for a misdirection play...  and another common occurence is the snap to go to the fullback, for a double-handoff misdirection.  The only other type of snap I've seen is a turn snap...  but this is usually a linebreaker...  and HORRIBLE idea.  It leaves your line without a center, basically, by making him double back to almost do a handoff to a passing running back...  Most times this play is ONLY useful in a college field as the players are less experienced and will go after the runner before the center himself...  in a professional field, the center would be downed before he could even try the attempt.|`|RE7nFT7Taa	YES YES|`|GYJqa3ubaa	the best for brett favre fans  http://astore.amazon.com/brett.favre.new...

Why?  Becuase of AB.  Fitz in dangerous because you can't just watch him, you have to watch his impressive, speedy, dynamic partner.  And while you're doing that Fitz will discect your defense.  And Warner is just laser beam accurate.    Next is Brady to Moss.  Moss can still burn up the field like nobody's business.  With Brady's ability to always be aware of the field and make good decisions, Moss is just a TD waiting to happen.    Peyton to Wayne is a threat, and Peyton spreads the ball around, which causes defenses a lot of problems.  But Peyton can be rattled.      Romo to TO - they beat themselves often enough to be at the bottom of this list.  And of course when TO self destructs he takes the whole team with him.|`|E3wAsSjUaa	Warner to Fitz.

Tom Brady connected with Randy Moss five times for only 62 yards and a touchdown in Super Bowl 42 against the New York Giants' number seven ranked defense.

2IdpvI2Vaa	The Glock 30 is a very nice gun but Glocks don't have any safety except for the trigger safety. That bothers some people and doesn't bother others. If carried it needs to be in the correct type of holster to insure that the trigger doesn't get accidentally pulled resulting in a discharge that you don't want to be around.    The best gun "for the wife" is the one she handles, shoots, and likes the best. What works for me, or for some other guy's wife, may not be what she likes and may not be the best for her. Plus, what is her experience level with guns?    What if the semi auto jams? Is she comfortable enough and skilled enough to quickly clear jams? Is she cool with empty brass flying all over? Does she not mind shooting full sized .45acps out of a basically, mini-Glock? Just because the .45 makes big holes it may not be what's best for her. Have you thought about a revolver like a Ruger .357magnum but loaded with .38special +P ammo? 158grains of hollow point without the magnum recoil. No jams with the revolver. Easy to use, easy to learn, etc.     Anyways... take her to the gun shops and let her handle the guns without pressuring her and find some guns she can try out and see what she likes best. It may not be what you want her to have but if she feels comfortable with it, any gun is better than no gun or a gun you're scared to shoot.|`|eo3EHDVIaa	The Glock is not much safer than a single action Semi-auto without a safety. It was designed to be absolutely safe while in it's matching holster and instantly ready to fire when out of it.    If this is for a wife's first gun, it would be a poor threat management tool in case she ever had to face a burglar alone. Unfortunately, most guns are designed for guys, the biggest market segment.    A revolver makes the best first gun. A revolver makes a great threat management tool.    She will need a relatively light double action trigger pull and a low bore axis. Therein lies the problem. Revolvers with a low bore axis usually have a heavy trigger pull. It's a matter of simple leverage. Revolvers with a light trigger pull are generally larger and that gives them a high bore axis.    Recently a solution has been found. Ruger is now making a polymer revolver. It's 5 shot, so the bore is low over the hand for less upward kick.It's light, so it's not tiring to hold out at arms length. The polymer frame absorbs the recoil, so it's not a beast to shoot. The 5 shot cylinder is actually a good thing in the bedroom shooting scenario. You can usually get off no more than 5 quick shots in the time it takes a perp to get across the room to you, so he' not likely to get to you and take away a loaded gun.    What makes this gun a better choice than other 5 shot small frame guns is that Ruger has figured out how to make the trigger pull lighter and smoother.    The 38Spl +P chambering is not a problem,especially now that Hornaday has developed a new bullet that is effective even in the underpowered .380 ACP caliber.    The only real downside to this gun as a first gun is the short barrel give you a limited sight radius, so it's not so much fun to practice with.    If your wife has a strong trigger finger, I would recommended a 3 inch Ruger SP101chambered in .357    What I'd like to see is Ruger apply their new triger geometry to the SP101 in a 4 inch barrel. That would be a great ladies gun!|`|ICtaFQxYaa	**For you:      G36      Slim frame, light weight, decent sight radius, low print, reliable.  G30 is a bit bulky for IWB every day, all day carry...not to mention the weight.    **For your wife:    Sig P232 in .380 or S&W 351PD (scandium) in .22mag.    Find out if your wife has the ability to pull triggers over 10lbs.  If not, go for the G19,  G26 or kahr PM380.    note:  A good holster, and tac-lite are just as important as your gun.  If its going to be CC....then practice with these additions, as well as clearing jams and loading spares.        good luck.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	The Glock 30 is a great pistol. It does not have a safety other than a trigger safety. I would get the wife a .357 revolver, which can be loaded with 38, or the Glock 26.|`|3cqfxNxlaa	One of the best guns on the market right now is the XD by Springfield Armory. It is easy to use and it comes in a variety of sizes that sport a full 5'' tactical barrel to a sub compact model with a 3'' barrel. The compact model is about 6.5'' long. This gun won the gun of the year award in 2006 from the NRA. Also, the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team uses Springfield Armory as their primary side arm(not especially the XD but other models) this information is from a Springfield Armory advertisement. The new XD's that came out this year with an external safety which would be great for your wife. The capacity is 10+1 in the 9mm Sub-Compact model. However, a female friend of mine recently bought a .45 and has been very pleased with it and the recoil is manageable. She bought the tactical version which helps with recoil due to the added weight. My advice is to take your wife to the range and let her shoot a few different calibers and she what she like. You can normally rent guns at your local range. Hope this helps. If you have any questions drop me an e-mail. I'll do my best to answer them.    Glen  Geaux Tigers!!!  :)|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	A glock 30 is a nice weapon.  A Glock 36 is slimmer, though it only holds six shots, there is always a second clip.  I'm just saying the thinner is better for concealablility.    Glocks do not have a traditional, external safety.  There is safeties that prevent the gun from firing without the trigger being pulled.      On a glock, if you pull the trigger, it will fire.  Simple as that.    As for your wife, I've seen small women who love to shoot a .357 magnum and big persons who don't like to shoot anything bigger than a 9mm.      Beretta bobcat and Tomcat are good guns.      Ruger LCP and LCR    Kel tec 32, 3AT, 9 and 11    Bersa 380    S&W makes some nice revovlers.      Taurus makes some nice revovlers and auto's too.    As I said, don't be afraid to let your wife shoot a friend's 40 or 45.    I'm partial to automatics.  They are easier to reload and usully hold more ammo.  They are not complicated.  Any major brand will be reliable if you keep it maintained.      Smaller guns tend to have more kick and harder to shoot accurately.      good luck, have fun.
9THtgkKlaa	I don't think anyone can fault Bruins fans for constantly picking Thomas to win things.  After all, some Bruin should win something, since I don't think they will even make the conference finals this year.  I think that Thomas is an overachieving average goaltender, like Chris Osgood in last years playoffs.  Thomas might get a nod for the Vezina, but Nicklas Backstrom and Steve Mason would give him a pretty good go for that as well.  To award Thomas the Hart would be strange.  He has only started 33 games.  Yes Thomas has the best save percentage, but Boston's defence makes those shots come from the outside, any goalie can make those saves.  Thomas is not a Hart Trophy candidate in my mind, but that's my opinion...    Right now, I like Evgeni Malkin and the way he is playing.  He plays the game at a high level, both talent wise, and competitiveness.  You'll never see Malkin give up after he makes a poor play.  He never wants to cost his team a goal, or a win.  The only thing about picking Malkin is that he gets to play with Sidney Crosby and his team is not playing very well right now.    You can't go wrong with picking Alexander Ovechkin.  Who else can change the flow of a hockey game in the blink of an eye?  Whether it's a big hit, big goal, or just some flashy moves to make a pass to someone in the open, Ovechkin is truly a Superstar.  Currently my pick for the Hart Trophy.|`|NkMXnQopaa	Agreed, it's incredibly hard to choose, however I pick Tim Thomas.    He has been on the top plays and highlight reels pretty much week after week. He also has made some outstanding saves and it showed during the All Star Game. I play goalie myself so maybe that's why I favor Thomas more, but in any case it's evident that he's having an awesome year.|`|731f08cf6e4058f2bad0dbda4f634b9baa	I have to go with Alex Ovechkin.  I think, so far, he is the pick. Malkin will end up scoring more points but AO is more important to his team + I guess he will score around 60 goals again with a solid +/- rate and more than 100 points. He hits, he gives passes, he scores goals, he energized his teammates. The Hart to me.|`|F934e4HQaa	TIM THOMAS|`|hHXG8ef6aa	ovie all the way|`|RlZvWkSIaa	I would say A tie, but if I had to choose, Malkin.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	If Thomas stats were much better than Fernandez' I'd have to pick him but in fact they are almost the same so either Fernandez and Thomas are the same or Boston is the reason. If that is the case then Thomas can't be the choice.   The Hart Memorial is "awarded to the player adjudged to be the most valuable to his team". The player best suited to that description is the rookie Steve Mason. He stepped in when Leclaire was injured and has put Columbus into playoff contention.|`|ee2981071a42643d323cba284e466becaa	ovechkin.    thomas is playing well, but is on a stacked team with guys having great seasons.    malkins team isnt even in the playoff picture right now

AA11619477	You will want to start gradually and determining what your body can handle running wise. I'd suggest starting with 12-16 miles a week for the first 2 weeks, increasing by 4 or so miles for the next 3 weeks, and doing a longer run by 2 miles (usually on sundays) every other week. Listen to your body and if something pains you longer than 48 hours, take a break. On your off days, do ab exercises, push ups, and other activities (biking, swimming) to engage and develop other muscles as well as prepare for the endurance you will need for cross country running. Set some goals for yourself and I'm sure you will do well!

BQG3j38Iaa	Practice your breathing by holding a kick board out in front of you. Usually, when you are kicking with a kick board, you hold on to the front of the kick board and lay on the it while you kick. With this drill, you hold on to the back of the kick board so it is way out in front of you. While you are kicking this way, you can put your face in the water and practice turning your head to breath. Granted, this prevents you from achieving proper body roll, but you'll have to ignore that until you can breath properly. You can also hold on to the wall while you kick and practice breathing.|`|PDJ8cy68aa	When you breathe out underwater before the breath, blow out from your nose, not your mouth. This will keep water from getting in your nose and will make your breathing more efficient. When you actually breathe, breathe through your mouth.  The pattern should be,   breathe through mouth, hold breathe as your head moves back into streamline position, blow out of nose until (or just before) you need another breath, then turn you head and breathe in through your mouth again.|`|aXdFTytvaa	try taking your head out of the water.

Other people have expressed the opinion that Bruce and his band didn't sound very in sync and he had to continually try to get them back on the count. Tracked music isn't going to go off-beat. If they didn't sound all together, it would be hard to fathom that it was tracked.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	I know the pre-game is always pre-recorded for timing purposes.  Try getting a bunch of fighter jets to fly over the stadium just as the Star Spangled Banner ends at 150 knots with a live singer!    I can see where the instruments were pre-recorded for halftime as well.  There is little time for a busted string or a cracked reed when you have a hard 12 minutes.    Even Yo-yo Ma's quartet was pre-recorded at the Inauguration because it was too cold to keep the instruments in tune.    Overall, it doesn't upset me IF the people on stage actually did the recording and it's for a specific purpose where doing it live is not an option.   That's a far cry from a Milli Vanilli or Ashlee Simpson situtation.

AA11341587	At the time that episode first came out, there were ties in the NHL.  However, it was pee-wee hockey.  Any rules can be in place.  And the rules tend to be related to availability of the arena.  Thus, as games have to end on time and be resurfaced ready for the next booking, they are more likely to allow games ending in a tie than going overtime and shootouts.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	before the 05-06 season yes  during and after the 05-06 season no  now it goes into overtime and you get a regular win and 2 points if you win and an overtime loss and 1 point if you lose|`|Qf5L0NWLaa	Yes it can.  In scrub hockey, my adult "beer league" hockey, and most games not at a college or pro level, games end in a tie.  You are only paying for the ice for an hour (actually around 50 minutes or less because of the time the zamboni takes to clean the ice, and the teams take for warmups). When that hour is up there is usually another group scheduled right after you.    Sometimes in the playoffs, the league you are in may book extra ice time in case a tie happens and might have a short overtime and/or a shootout.    Now here's my little rant:  We are talking hockey not NHL.  NHL is not = hockey.  Hockey > NHL.  When there was a lockout in 2004-05 most idiots in the media were saying hockey was canceled.  They should have checked the AHL, european leagues, and their local rinks.|`|j5fNBBi9aa	not anymore it cant....but they used to be able to after the first overtime if no1 scored itd end in a tie.....now if its still tied after an overtime period they go to a shootout....rule changed like 3 years ago...|`|yvfQpDabaa	No it can't.    They go into overtime and the first to score wins.|`|eEhZslTYaa	There used to be ties - if both teams had the same score at the end of the game, there would be a 5 minute overtime and if no one scored it would be a tie. But they changed it in the NHL so there are no ties allowed. If it's a tie, it will go to overtime for 5 minutes, and if one of the teams score, that team wins. If no one scores, it will go to a shootout that will last until one team outscores the other.|`|MxzV5hDZaa	It would depend on the league said hockey game was being played in.|`|TzaWANaLaa	It can then it goes to overtime and if someone still doesn't score, it will be settled in a shootout.|`|F934e4HQaa	NO, IT USED TO BUT NOW THEY DO A 5 MINUTE SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME (OT).  IF THAT ENDS WITHOUT A GOAL IT GO'S TO A THREE MAN SHOOTOUT WHICH IS  ONE ON ONE WITH THE GOALIE.  IF ALL 3 PLAYERS GO AND IT"S STILL A TIE MORE SHOOTERS GO UNTIL THERE"S A WINNER.    PS: GOOD LUCK ON THE ESSAY|`|9GzkVwfGaa	nope. It goes to OT (Overtime) than if either teams do not score than it goes to a SO (Shootout). The OT is 5 minutes.|`|2iuZdBXraa	Is that the episode where Lisa and Bart are on opposing teams and Lisa is the goalie and Bart has a breakaway at the end of the championship game and the crowd is split 50/50 and screaming and then Bart and Lisa look at the screaming crowd and decide to hug each other instead and the game ends in a tie and then the crowd goes ahhhh and then they riot and start fires cuz no one won?   Never seen it.

mRvZq0VZaa	Just keep practicing.  Remeber to commit to the rail / box and center your weight over your bindings.  It might feel like your leaning too far forward, but its unlikely you actually are.  Typically people don't commit and lean uphill, which causes their skis to slide-out from under them.  Also be mindful of how you approach to box and don't come at it too diagonally because you'll end up sliding off the box (right to left).      Good luck.|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	make sure your feet are centered over the exact center of the skis and that you work on your balance. approach the rail directly, not at an angle.  use your legs to pop as best you can and if you get a lighter ski such as the Line Invader, then it will be easier.  www.lineskis.com/home

BiMkowVMaa	Jordan's 55. Plus he had that key assist to Wennington at the end of the game to win it. New York was a legit team back them. I think that makes the accomplishment all the more impressive.    But I really don't want to discredit any of these performances the past two days. It's been entertaining regardless of the person... it's all about the performances.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	That's a tough one because we haven't seen a 50 Point triple double since 1975. But MJ did play against the tougher team with tougher rules.|`|0TAld46gaa	Jordans 55 meant more  since Knicks were a good team back than.

I seriously doubt either one of them care, Same with Kobe.|`|FUoKu13Daa	If Jordan did it with the same cast or characters as todays Knicks and the Knicks having the same coach then I would go LBJ performance.    But Jordan 55 came after he was out of the league for awhile and it also came against a tough brutal New York that was one of the best team in the league that was coached by a very defensive minded coach in Pat Riley.    Not to take anything from LBJ or Kobe performance, but they had their way against one of the weakest defense in the league and not a top team.|`|a9b98318350219f8c9859b49ea5c5dfaaa	Jordan.

Triple double.|`|1Vp9OgTLaa	It's Jordan by far, it has nothing to do with the fact that it was after a two year lay-off doing ummm, ummm, whatever he was doing..but the fact that it was against a defensive oriented team is what counts...no of the high output games of today will be as impressive as those in the past...the rules are so much different and the things that they call fouls now hinder the defensive player...you had to be dead or dying to get a fould called in the mid to late 80's early 90's....there are no more teams that play like the Bad Boy Pistons...there's no way Kobe would put 81 up on those guys...the closest team with that type of mindset might be San Antonio...and that's only becuase of Bowen..when you think of great defensive teams of the past, the entire team played great team defense, it wasn't just one defensive specialist...it doesn't happen in todays game, it's about scoring and scoring only, Stern likes offense...I may have gotten a little away from your question but there you go...|`|jAqVoGlmaa	u have to go with jordan any day.. as of now.. but please do not compare the bron kobe performance at MSG... lebron takes that cake eazy.... koME should be ashamed to post such selfish numbers... would have loved to see the lakers lose that game|`|SKsSRO3Caa	Mivhsrl Jordan because knicks are garbage right now|`|bU2rGQHSaa	Good question because both performances are legendary, but I have to go with MJ, simply because he dropped 55 on arguably the best defensive (and definitely the most physical) team in the league!!!  The Knicks were contenders, and deep with guys like Ewing, Oakley, Starks, Harper, Mason etc...and Jordan dominated in just his fifth game back after 18 months off.  Also, Jordan made the winning play with a spectacular setup for Bill Wennington's game-winning dunk with only seconds left.  Jordan's 'double-nickel' was superior in my opinion!|`|fz77R5Jmaa	45 MJ! no doubt  he was comin back and only in his 4th or 5th game i think
uToFh7Beaa	For a woman, I would reccomend TRADITIONAL karate (not the schools that thrive on tournaments). Jiu Jitsu focuses on a lot of joint locks, Judo involves a lot of throwing, but of the three you mentioned, Aikido might suit you. However, I would highly reccomend a traditional Okinawan karate.|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	First of all, don't get the idea that 6 months of martial arts will give you enough to defend yourself in the street.  To become proficient will take years.  That being said, the years you spend will be rewarding, and none of us is getting any younger.    If it's available, you might consider looking into Aikido.  Aikido doesn't rely on size or strength to accomplish it's techniques.  It's highly effective when practiced by a proficient person - Japanese police are required to master Aikido to be eligible for promotion.    Most Aikido dojos offer daily classes, which might be broken up by skill level.  There is o requirement to attend every class.  There is no set cirriculum.  You go, you learn.  That's all.|`|73wpIlgnaa	no taekwondo! please, just trust me.      go for jiu jitsu if that is your only other option|`|GpzvrlHdaa	As a karate instructor I have been asked this question many times.  When a woman asks me that I tell them to get 3 to 6 months of judo training before coming to me.  The ability to put an attacker on the ground, giving you time to escape is paramount, and some of both stand-up and grappling are needed.  Or if martial art is of equal importance to defense, join the club with the most qualified instructor you can find, but be sure they do the defense you want to learn, not just the sport for contests.   J|`|XBUeYE41aa	For self defense? Pistol, then knife/sword, then martial arts- the Tae kwon do is fair choice for women as leg strength in women is used effectively. Mix with some grappling from Judo , Hapkido, or Ju-jitsu and women has a fair chance of surviving.  Graciella Casalis has some knife fighting techniques from escrima that she knows works- used on attacker , class has Xrays of damage done to street attacker with his own knife.  Shorei-Ryu from Okinawa class might be good option if available- one young lady took it said wasn't going to be raped again- cops came by couple times asking where she was when her attackers got crippled up- class alibied her, cops let it go as drunken mutual combat on former rapists part. Staff and knife work part of training.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	In my opinion, it has more to do with how good you get and not what you get good at, so find a good teacher that you are comfortable with, and TRAIN HARD!      Some schools, however are more focused on the beauty of the movements, and others are focused more on the practical application... that is not a style vs. style thing... just a school vs other school thing.  Find a school that has a high value in self defense.    What area do you live in... maybe I can help you find a good school?|`|gJzEAvNTaa	i'm sorry but you gotta be realisitic,     it's kind of a joke for women to take judo and aikido, which are both grappling sports requiring strength and endurance, (especially in your case) you want to use judo and aikido to take down a hostile male opponent. you're not athletic, your not stronger than a male, and you don't want to do anything fancy. (your words btw)    well, if you have to stick with the schools in your area, go with ju jitsu for the training experience, but just keep this in mind. ju jitsu involves many ground techniques, which isn't the best place to be on the concrete road or in self defense. (you wouldn't want to rough up your pretty skin and beautiful face on the asphalt now would you?)     if it's available in your area, try wing chun. it's designed specifically for average working people who don't always have time to practice. it was also founded by a woman. if you can't? too bad. but just keep some things in mind.     avoiding confrontation for you is better than anything else. if you go shopping, why not get all your girlfriends and go together? i doubt a man will attack and molest a whole group of women. i know i wouldnt. second, if you're in range, use a finger jab, stick it in your attacker's eyes, then run like hell. also, keep in mind a man's genitals are very soft, kick it, grab it, smack it, do anything you can to the eyes, throat or balls to catch your attacker by surprise then get out of there.     that's self defense.   aikido, judo, ju jitsu, many of these are SPORTS  korean arts are even worse, stay away    if you attacker locks his joints? judo, aikido, grappling techniques in general wouldn't even work    hope this helps  and remember: be REALISTIC   (you're not bruce lee)|`|72mlkIP7aa	the martial art that you can count on...both protect yourself and punish the wrong doer...MUAY THAI..|`|N0yMhKnUaa	Not Jiu Jitsu for a girl that would probably make it easier to get raped. Imagine wrestling on the ground with a man. Jiu Jitsu trains people to get on the ground and agree to wrestle whether they realize it or not. Kung Fu, Karate, and Tae kwon do train you to stay on your feet and fight. When you train to get on the ground all day and wrestle naturally you will do the same thing in a fight because you don't really have time to think. You just do what they trained you to do in class. You want to be able to run if you get the chance and Jiu Jitsu makes it harder to get away.

lMDy8W0Raa	If the Lakers play with  the right amount of aggression (especially Gasol and Odom) the Lakers are gonna win. Like you said, Ariza is improving with every game and he will be crucial. The bench has more depth. I just hope the machine nails those 3 pointers, and Fisher nails those lay ups (haha)    The Lakers have more probabilities to win this one than the Celtics, and I'm being objective.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	It can be done but it won't be easy. I just hope the Cletics take the Lakes lightly but I doubt they will. I think its going to be a very close game.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	It was a great win tonight. I hope they can keep it close against Boston ,But we will see Thursday.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	In toilet paper the Lakers have a better team than the Celtics. Very good bench and starters. Until the Lakers acquire and sign a player that will bring depth to their bench the Lakers will own the. I expect the Lakers to win.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	The only Reason I want the Lakers to beat Boston is cause the Cavs would lead the Eastern Confrence. But Boston is going to play hard after what happend on Christmas Day.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	They better.    I'm counting on the Lakers again. It all depends on Pau Gasol. If he can play like he did last time I think the Lakers can win, otherwise I think Boston is too good right now. Their defense is suffocating and they have been shooting 50% from the field during their streak and 40% from three point line. Lakers have got to play defense.    EDIT: Fine be like that, then I'll tell you what I really think, Lakers are going to lose...bad.    EDIT: Ohhh, you seem angry. Don't forget last time Lakers won in Cleveland was when LeBron was a senior in High School. We'll just have to wait thill Sunday. Untile then, take it easy MC.    EDIT: way to make fun of wallace, when your center just went down.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	Lakers are going to lose sorry man. Gasol is too soft for KG and Pierce is going to destroy Kobe on defense. Sorry to break it to you, but the Celtics are seeking revenge.|`|dDhTMacAaa	They won't.      Celtics won't let Kobe get 60, or touch 30...and the C's prevail!|`|NzS7yD32aa	um its a close one I cant choose    but the best team will win|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Thumb up to Cavs in 09 YES WE CAN    I have a feeling it would be 5-11 points game.  They will beat the Celtics as long they play great defense, just like Josh Powell's defense tonight. I'm looking forward to see him again against Boston. Lastly, I am not worried on offense. What concerned me is defense and Sasha's decision makings(really, I am getting tired of him shooting the ball quickly every single time when he received a pass from his teammate because he usually can't keep his composure).|`|tnqO91xoaa	yeah      Kobe will have a 45+ point game  Pao and Odom will have a  20+ points 10+ rebounds game    Lakers will crush them by 2|`|2MdE0Npkaa	as a laker fan... this is hard for me to say... but I think they're gonna lose.  not so much because bynum is out but because the lakers won last time, and cut them off their 19 game winning streak.  this time they're on a 12 game winning streak and they're at home. the fact that bynum went down is only going to make things worse.  so i give this one to the celts, but it's going to be close. the laker s aren't going to just get owned like in the finals.  i think the chemistry of the new look lakers has had time to season and hopefully they find a way to pull it off. it would really make me happy and give me more confidence in the lake show.  if the lakes win, it will be a real statement.     lamar definitely has to step it up, but we can never count on him. he could have a great game, or a shi*TT*ie one.  and i thought ariza was injured too?  gasol is going to have to have a game like at the knicks and kobe is gonna have to match it.  whatever lamar puts in will make it a W.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Maybe|`|HOtYR1ksaa	I rather have Bynum in, but I think Lakers can still pull off another win, but they have to play good offense and defense.|`|GIVarsPnaa	I think the X-Factor for the Lakers is their bench. They really need to step up and take advantage when the Celtics' Big Three are resting. If Kobe and Gasol have good games, they have a shot but it is going to be harder against their defense.|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	Tough test for the lakers but your right the key is if pau and odom step up and if the laker pg make rondo a jump shooter ........odom can cause mismatches but he has to play smart and not let the celtics physical play get to him.|`|NOK8lxP0aa	Man hell ya we beat boston already we can do it again, its a waste of time playin boston,|`|xyhwDCBLaa	I want the celtics to win but i think laker fans make this a big thing cuz they think this will heal the lakers seeing how the celtics spanked them in the finals. Key words:REGULAR SEASON. obviously both of these teams will make the playoffs if they both get to the finals then we can answer this question. but until then celtics are better|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Beat them in  2 OT's to slow them vets down for us its the least you can do. Also, injure House and Allen to make their bench useless or better yet Pierce :)
RrGtax7xaa	I don't really know why I think because there was no one really out there who he thought he could get. I do think we need one, no offence to Denilson or Song but I did like having Flamini at the club so Cesc was able to go forward more. I thought he might go for Barca's Yaya Toure, Kolo's brother but he didn't. I think it would have helped if we got Alonso or Barry summer just gone. We got Arshavin now who's versatile but not a defensive midfielder, we'll see how he gets along. :]|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Bc he is a genius? At least I USED to think so...|`|iQvkT8Doaa	Amaury Bischoff is coming back, keep an eye on him.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Aminda,I doubt Bischoff is a defensive midfielder,he's more of a box to box midfielder.    As for your question,Wenger defines a defensive midfielder who is a "prima donna" and an "old man" in his dictionary.|`|mRF1xv7iaa	he said it on the arsenal website a week ago.    but i still don't know why he didn't sign one.    we are short on any type of midfielder let alone a defencive one.    we have nasri, denilson, song, arshavin(maybe), eboue(i think he might have an injury though), and the youngsters.    we don't have rosicky, fabregas, walcott, or diaby(suspension & injury)    so we have like 5 midfielders to  chose from!    maybe wenger could loan a decent midfielder?    but we will just have to believe in wenger    :)|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	arsenal have denilson and diaby for defensive midfield|`|3zbGNp4maa	What about playing Toure as the holding midfielder. He can take long shots.|`|PYiQGwsAaa	Because Wenger Didnt See One|`|STLnjU7Raa	BECAUSE he chose not to|`|dqy7DdoSaa	Arsene Wenger did not sign a defensive midfield because he could not find one of a high standard at a reasonable price.     Wenger is well known for picking people from no where that become stars a very good scouting eye but he lacks the aggression to really go after one of the top defensive midfielders.    Possibly he is trying to develop Song and before Cesc got injured Denilson and even Ramsey maybe thats why no move came.    All in all i thought it was a poor decision by the club not to sign any players just loaning out 5 developing players with top 4 contendor Aston Villa signing Emile Heskey in what looks like another problem for Arsenal's top 4 hopes.    Fully agree with the comment below me what Arsenal need is a better defense overall: keeper, defense and defensive midfielder.|`|wXAiWcpnaa	I really don't understand the move, Arsenal need a strong and defensive midfielder (Viera type) a center-back and a keeper much more then another attacking midfielder.|`|WK8887Tsaa	Because he likes using his youngsters. That way, in 3 years, they'ss have masses of Premier League experience and Arsenal will be the best team in the league by a country mile- another unbeaten season?    Simples.

S0N3BRecaa	Fedor capitolizes on overly aggressive people. When their aggression fails, and if they're still concious Fedor has probably the best ground game in MMA and has SEVERAL Russian Combat Sambo wolrd heavyweight championchips to prove it.    Fedor wins, 1:30 into the first round.|`|w5sK75MPaa	Fedor would destroy him 1st round first 2 minutes due to stoppage after Fedor ground & pounded him. Lesnar needs more fights to compete with Fedor.|`|21d89af3f86c8fce28c5b17799cabb2caa	They should hold the fight on Monday night Raw ! That way they could make it last longer. You know, get the crowd involved, throw a chair, and have Triple H run out and trip Fedor ! LOL. I RULE !  But, seriously, Fedor in the opening of the 2nd round, by knockout. Thank you|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Good question. I'd have to go with Fedor just cause of the experience. He's taken down some giants. Be a good fight!|`|IkzENsqUaa	Fedor in the first or second with a submission I think Lesnar could take him down but he doesn't have the submission defense to hang with the really good heavyweights this includes Mir|`|1Byis7Flaa	Great hype!  Brock and Fedor would meet cautiously in the middle, Brock would take the aggressor role, both would throw some strikes, then Brock would take Fedor down and start his ground and pound and hammer fists.  After a few seconds Fedor would throw his legs up and over Brock's neck, Fedor would lock onto Brock's available wrist, for the arm bar.  Brock would stand and lift Fedor and slam Fedor to the mat, but, the Fedor and the arm lock would still be applied. Again Brock would stand and lift Fedor and slam Fedor to the mat, Fedor and the arm bar remains in tact, and Brock would tap.    Unless of course Brock catches Fedor on the chin with one of his hammer fists. Then KO for Brock and the new WAMMA champ    First round.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	brock was good in wrestling, but lets be honest, in his first fight against frank mir he tapped out to a leg lock that wasn't even in all the way. fedor is a monster, the only fight he lost was due to a illegal elbow. fedor first round!!!|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	I agree experience would be the issue.  Lesnar is under rated and his physicality is amazing, but Fedor is as tough as they come.  In a few years, could be a different story.|`|p9RQcqNzaa	fedor round two at the latest with an arm bar, or other submission. brocks no where near the fighter that fedor is even with his speed and strength|`|u93eagkqaa	Are you serious with this question? Fedor would whoop anyone in MMA.|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Fedor would win right now, but if Lesnar trains hard and can learn to avoid mistakes, I think in a year or two, he might be able to compete with Fedor.  Brock is a fast learner and better than most MMA fans want to admit.  The odds favored Couture, and Brock won.  Once Brock beats Mir, people will take him seriously.  I think Brock WILL beat Mir.  Still though, Brock needs more experience regarding the little things, then we can start talking about matching them up.

7RziqsDcaa	Why is Plaxico Burress still on the Giants roster?|`|4kdlE54Paa	Currently he is just suspended.  His outcome with the NFL will be detemined by Commish Goodell upon Michael Vick's request for reinstatement following his July release from jail.  He is still on the roster and still has some type of value to him considering the circumstances of his off the field BS.  The Falcons are trying ti mitigate their damages and will try and get something from him either by a dollar amount or trade.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Because the Falcons still officially have the rights to him...Any team that wants him has to go through the Falcons, unless they flat out release him, which they haven't...|`|op4fEbEVaa	They still have the rights to his contract|`|uQrIdrjfaa	i hate him|`|gmZLGuNtaa	falcons are having second thoughts about vick....<br>  <br>  because theyre comparing vick, to their current qb...<br>  <br>  they have a feeling that vick will get them to the playoffs...<br>  <br>  but then again...who knows...|`|AOA8TJraaa	He is only suspended. He is not gone from the NFL or the Falcons Roster|`|BwhMgmxFaa	cuz hes fat|`|AA12103453	He is suspended from the NFL, so as a business move they kept him on the roster. They explained it when it first happened. If they were to cut him they would take a large hit to the salary cap that they can't afford. If they leave him on the roster as a suspended player then it has no effect on them.

oaALpra0aa	I would have cried too if I received rapturous applause and adoration from the stands.

And that means, he can do whatever the hell he wants to do. that NWO person who puts federer down all the time, is a Nobody.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I completely agree with you, and here's what I just wrote to the guy ith the Vladmir Putin avatar:    "Don't be an a**, dude, he cried on Sunday because the way Rafa's got into his head is overwhelming and he probably just consciously realized that. The guy's the best player the game of tennis' ever seen - I know it, Rafa knows it, he himself knows it, we all know it -, so that's gotta be particularly tough on him. It broke my heart seeing him like that, but then it made me admire him even more when he accepted Rafa's hug and words, showing that he doesn't translate any of his frustration into anger or anything negative towards Rafa himself. They're both amazing people who respect and admire each other even though they're each other's biggest rival. That's amazing."|`|1ieKW07Naa	a week.|`|AA11593134	whenever people like you stop asking these questions and let it go...?|`|w8fP7aBNaa	i just realised this but federer is a mentally fragile pu$$Y that cries and his nutsack falls off when rafa puts him under pressure!|`|q5bYAmgpaa	I think that there's way too much attention on Federer crying than there should be. Rafa won and we should be talking about that!|`|U5XIFWoKaa	Yeah. Rafa won. He deserves to celebrate his victory. Congratulations Rafa. Nadal and Fed are both great players. Give Rog a break.

K2mXhSGlaa	The argument could be made that neither of the Hardy's are phenomenal as single's competitors.    Skilled? They are both skilled. I think that they wouldn't have made it this far if they weren't. It takes more than skills to get noticed to. Shelton Benjamin is more skilled than Matt or Jeff Hardy. Yet, he lacks the charisma that both Matt & Jeff Hardy, indeed, have. Charisma carries a skilled wrestler a long way. If Shelton Benjamin was a great talker and he cut exciting promos, the WWE Universe couldn't stop talking about him.    As for the statement, I disagree. That doesn't really describe my point of view. Matt Hardy might be the better of the two. But, if Matt were the same dare-devil as his brother, it would be Matt that had more marks than Jeff Hardy.  |`|hT32vMkPaa	it does take skills it takes guts|`|AA11105044	i agree with you Madison jeff hardy has changed you should she him what he wears on smackdown to fight undertaker|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Jeff does more than just jump off ladders.

7sa6B6Qhaa	No, it is not.  RVD isn't even under contract with the company currently.  He's been working a promotion in Spain called Nu Wrestling Evolution, and doing a web cast called RVD-TV that's had multiple people, including his close friend and TNA champion, Samoa Joe on it.   I don't think the WWE would be privy with RVD putting the competition's champion on his website, and yes, if RVD were signed, that website would fall under WWE jurisdiction.      Plain and simple, RVD may return someday, but there are no immediate plans for such a thing.|`|AA11105044	HE IS FIGHTING SOME WHERE ELSE|`|B85pe4Izaa	Is yur friend Vince Mcmahon????????????|`|qWvROHmjaa	dunno|`|SBIdTfDDaa	No what you friend probably heard was a rumor, THQ has never said RVD will be in SVR 2009. because RVD is not sign to WWE Roster, so THQ would get in trouble from Vince Mcmahon himself. who wants the games to be similar to his current roster|`|Mr2lcNR2aa	I dunno|`|bLhTwPqIaa	I have not heard of him being confirmed, but they have said there will be No legends this zear, but have also heard there may be a few ECW Legends.

M9Jz5tXFaa	Bueno, mi relacion con las artes marciales es bastante nueva, comparada con la de otros "amigos" que han respondido antes que yo...  Todo empezo por una contractura, yo tenia algo asi como 13 a?os y tenia el cuello re duro a causa de la vida sedentaria y de la energia acumulada, etc. Consulte con una kinesiologa y me recomendo que practique JUDO porque era muy muvido y me ayudaria a sacarme la energia de mas.  Fue ahi cuando empese, me gusto enseguida y le puse mucha dedicacion, tanto que pasaba con el mejor promedio en los examenes para pasar de cinto. Lastimosamente, luego de 2 a?os de practicar JUDO, mis senseis me defraudaron demostrando ser personas falzas y creidas por ser cintos ****** y campeones mundiales y etc... Lo deje, practicamente corte relaciones con la practica de artes marciales, a no ser por mi gusto por ellas. Pase 2 a?os de inactividad, hasta que conoci a algunas personas que ahora son mis mejores amigos, conoci a ezequiel, que practica TAEKWONDO ITF, y a guillermo que hace SIPALKI DO, empezamos a luchar en joda cada uno utilizando sus tecnicas de combate.  Fue asi como me llamo la atencion el TAEKWONDO ITF y decidi provarlo en el do jang en el que entrena ezequiel; conoci a mi sabon que se llama oscar y es muy buena persona ademas de no ser creido y ense?ar muy bien. Se puede decir que asi me reconcilie con las artes marciales. Actualmente hace 2 meses masomenos que practico TAEKWONDO y estoy en cinto blaco-punta amarilla, me gusta mucho y me divierte, ademas de que la chica que me gusta  muchisimo tambien practica TAEKWONDO, solo que es 3 dan, entrena en otro dojang y ademas es campeona mundial de formas 2007, es un poco intimidante jaja pero estoy buscando la oportunidad para conocerla y caerle bien, bueh jajaj me fui por las nubes...  En fin, siempre me gustaron las artes marciales, nunca fui bueno para los deportes de equipo, prove basquet, futbol, handbol, pero lo que realmente me apasiono fueron la artes marciales, porque exigen disciplina, perseverancia, integridad, autocontrol, etc. me fascinan.  Por ahora mi objetivo es practicarlo con mucha dedicacion y si dios quiere y permite algun dia llegar a 1 dan.  Bueno en fin... los caminos de la vida... =S =) =P  (aca esta mi messenger por si me quieren contactar, para hablar del tema y darnos consejos ke se yo : mathewcontreras@hotmail.com)  ok esta es mi historia Quiero agradecer a mi Sabon por transmitir buenos valores y ense?ar bien y a mi amigo eze que es un groso.

Te dire que yo empece a practicar las artes marciales en la modalidad de kung fu wu shu, esto en el mes de septiembre del a?o 1998, ya que mis hermanos menores iban al taekwon do y a mi me gustaba ir a verlos, pero como yo iba al gimnasio de pesas, en ese mismo gym daban clases de kung fu y decidi empezar con mis clases. Tenia tan solo 15 a?os de edad.    Pero por razones escolares( iba a entrar a la prepa) ,y sentimentales ( tuvo mucho que ver que la chica de la secundaria que me gustaba no me haya pelado ja ja ja ... ah que recuerdos...) tuve que dejar su practica.    Paso un a?o y 8 meses y en la preparatoria hubo una demostracion de artes marciales japonesas.  Judo, Kendo, Aikido, pero sobre todo , entre ellas estaba el Karate do, tecnica de la cual me enamore a primera vista y a partir de la semana siguiente en un deportivo cerca de mi casa empeze a practicarlo, asi dure 1 mes.     Despues, en la avenida que estaba enfrente de mi casa, se puso una escuela de karate do, estilo shotokan, y empeze a practicarlo con mi sensei Juan Medina, el cual me ense?o las bases del karate shotokan y no solo eso, me hizo madurar mucho tanto fisica como mentalmente y a conocerme mejor, cuales eran mis defectos y mis virtudes y a tratar de mejorar dia con dia, asi dure 5 a?os, del 2000 al 2004`para ser mas precisos.    Pero, desafortunadamente, la escuela cayo en un bache, y tuvo que cerrarse por problemas economicos del local, asi que deje de practicar karate shotokan, ya que en mi cuidad, solo habian dos dojos de karate shotokan, pero ahora solo queda una, pero en otro municipio de mi estado, muyyy lejos de mis dominios.    Gracias a dios, en le colegio donde trabajo, conoci al sensei Rolando Quiroz, y ahora estoy practicando con el, y me esta guiando satisfactoriamente en la practica del shito ryu, que la verdad me ha encantado y me ha dado la confianza de volver a creer en mi mismo.    Gracias sensei Rolando, prometo dar lo mejor de mi cada dia, y le mando muchos saludos desde aqui.|`|LFs89JaNaa	Yo practico el Haedong Kumdo, es el arte del sable coreano, se ha debatido mucho cual es ms antigo si el Kendo o ste.

Yo por lios de horarios no pude seguir jugando al tenis y como soy bastante inquieta y quera hacer algo, mi pap me pregunto si no quera probar con karate, me acuerdo que me dijo: "prob un mes y si no te gusta dejas y listo", obviamente yo no estaba para nada convencida, pero igual decidi probar y ver que pasaba. Y bueno... ese mes se transformaron en 10 a?os de prctica, faltando solo cuando estaba realmente enferma o por algn viaje.  Hace 2 a?os me lesion las rodillas y tuve que dejar porque sino corria el riego de ir a cirugia, pero no quera dejar de hacer artes marciales... entonces un amigo de mi hermano me coment que en un dojo cerca de mi casa iban a hacer una excibicin de aikido asi que la fui a ver. Tampoco muy convencida, empez, debo reconocer que pensaba que iba a ser fcil y no iba a demandarme demasiado esfuerzo, sobre todo viniendo de una lesin bastante complicada en las rodillas, pero en la primera clase me di cuenta que era todo lo contrario, que se requiere de muchsmo esfuerzo y dedicacin para llegar a dominarla y bueno... hace 2 a?os que practico y no pienso dejarla, realmente me encanta!

Krav Maga, Kali, Sambo con un amigo que tiene nombre como de mujer y que perteneci a las fuerzas armadas de los specnaz, como fumos compa?eros protegiendo a un personaje por cerca de 4 a?os, me interes aprender un poco de lo que les ense?an ah y sus conocimientos me impresionarn.

Tendra que buscar entre la cantidad de basura que permanece guardada entre mis cajas para recordar todo lo que he visto. Sin embargo, debo confesar que slo me he quedado grabado todo aquello que he considerado vital por dos razones: Porque no puedo desechar su veracidad y porque ya me he enterado de un caso similar o yo mismo lo he vivido. Actualmente asistir a un curso que hemos organizado de Petiki Tirsia Siradas con uno de sus ms importantes expositores a un precio de locura a comparacin con otros que a los que he asistido, cuando el curso termine el diploma ir al mismo lugar que los dems, lo que importa es lo que traigo en la cabeza, los ttulos y reconocimientos slo valdrn de algo cuando me paguen por ganarlos y no al revz.  Entr en el mundo de las Artes Marciales por mi Padre y an antes de adquirir la capacidad de razonar.  Porsteriormente, al enfrentar tres fraudes financieros me busqu sustento en el apasionante mundo de la Proteccin Ejecutiva, ahi me d cuenta que asi como no todo aquel que practica tcnicas de pelea no es un arte marcialista, tampoco todos los escoltas son expertos en seguridad integral.   Y en el medio te encuentras a quienes han viajado a Rusia, a Israel, E.U., Colombia, Filipinas, etc. a entrenar y regresan igual de intiles, pero eso si, llenos de diplomas y no desaprovechan a usar sus pins de tal o cual disciplina que "entrenaron".|`|9cZGgajZaa	Todo empeso un dia en que compre unos guantes de box para divertirme con mis amigos, me los llevaba a la preparatoria y ahi jugabamos box, haciamos torneos entre todos y nos divertiamos mucho, haciamos apuestas y demas cosas.

Y asi fue como decidi meterme a boxeo, yo anteriormente habia entrenado goju ryu, tae kwon do y lucha grecorromana, pero mis conocimientos me fueron inutiles a la hora de pelear con "guerrero".  El box me convencio, aun lo sigo practicando y es el arte marcial que mas me a gustado, creo que la practicare toda mi vida =)|`|779fa66935209902ea50238b48a79e28aa	Bueno yo por mi parte, practico taekwondo  desde hace ya un a?o, soy cinturon amrillo y en la verad puedo decir que es un gran experiencia haber empezado a practicar este estilo de combate, ya que no solo te ense?a a como golpear o patear sino tambien filosofia y autocontrol, factores esenciales en la vida de uno.|`|xFget4Doaa	es una pregunta muy similar a la mia pero no importa    hola   bueno yo empeze con esto desde los 10 a?os en realidad fue cuando empeze a tomar nocion de lo que hacia ya que practicaba desde mucho antes con mi padre en forma informal el desde chico fue boxeador y fue quien me inclino por serlo mantube 2 a?os en el boxeo y participe en 4 torneos, 2 como exibicion y 2 de pelea me aburrio un poco ya que se habia vuelto muy monotono en los torneos siempre eran los mismos participantes y ya antes de un ring siempre te los cruzabas para hacer sparring en algun gym ! deje y me gusto la idea de hacer kick boxing pero antes de poder llegar tube que pasar por otros deportes de contacto como el light contact donde los golpes nada mas valian desde la extremidades de la cadera hacia arriba y la cabeza hacia abajo y barridas pero sin demasiada fuerza fue muy aburrido despues continue con el full contact ahy fue mejorando debido a que lo aprendido en boxeo me serbia muy bien lleve 2 a?os en esta practica mientras que un a?o fue de full contact con low-kick fui endureciendo mi espinilla hasta tal modo que perdi casi por completo la sencibilidad tmb entrene el muslo para resistir golpes aunque aun me siguen doliendo tube un a?o de kick boxing compitiendo ... y queria seguir aprendiendo no me sentia conforme  entonces buscando dojos de muay thay resulta que mi profesor marcos aguilar de full contact tmb daba clases en otro gym de muay thay ahy fue cuando instantaniamente lo llame por telefono y hasta el dia de hoy soy uno de sus mejores aprendices llevo 5 a?os en la practica    boxeo ............ 2 a?os  light contact.... 1a?o  full contact........2a?os  kick boxing.......1 a?o  muay thay..........5a?os      Ademas tmb entreno en forma informal ninjutsu gracias a mi hermano quien lleva entrenando 9 a?os     dentro de poco empiezo las clases de jujitsu y voy a probar suerte en el vale tudo

The way India is performing now is good for the game of Cricket...monopoly in cricket has ended, teams r competing well against each other....   people who cannot digest others success blame it on luck and things like these... so don't be a sore loser.  though aus team was always involved in cheating and sledging... we gave full credit to their performance ... we believed that aus were champs right? we even hired an aus coach( greg Chappel). Appreciate good performances buddy... don't try to find reason's for others success.    edit; i agree that i dunno much about match-fixing, but u urself told that the bookie pays some amount to the "TEAM MEMBERS"!!... does'nt this mean that they r selling their integrity?    hey, we know that aus have been a terrific side for over a decade, but don't u think its good if other teams r catching up to ur standards....    just because aus cheated us in sydney, 2008...u can't say that aus always wins against India by fraud.right?  same applies here as well buddy....|`|AA11088802	y it will not valid

0583ad70e8336d13342bfa4c9e22025aaa	The Concept2 machines are the probably the best rowing machines on the market, the latest models will probably set you back quite a bit but feature optional accessories such as log cards which can be set up with a computer to track your times and fitness and are really comfortable to use (I speak from experience! :D)    Arms, legs, chest, back, abs - even your mind. Your whole body gets a complete workout from the efficient, rhythmic motion of rowing. Rowing is such a great exercise in so many different ways.    - Low-impact (easy on the knees and ankles)  - High calorie burner (because it uses so many muscle groups)  - Great for joint health (joints move through a wide range of motion)  - Upper body (completes the stroke)  - Lower body (the legs initiate the drive)  - Works the back and abs too  - Superb aerobic fitness (great for cardiovascular fitness)  - Relieves stress (for overall health and well-being)

dCbIHBpGaa	Rugby is ok but you do sometime get some boring passages of play and some games do seem to have no tries but have a result decided by say 4 penalty kicks to 3. Like football you get some games that are free flowing attacking games and others that are a dull grind.     Quite often when I watch rugby union there is a lot of -  player runs into opponents, ball finds its way to the fullback who kicks it high and long....to the other fullback who takes two steps...then kicks it high and long...to the first fullback who kicks in into the crowd. There is a line out and the ball is tipped and then passed back to the fullback...who kicks it high and long to the other fullback..who kicks it back over everybody to the first fullback again and this continues for a while until one of the fullbacks decides to kick it in the crowd again. I think thats why people like to go to the rugby as sitting in the crowd you will get a good view of the ball as it is in the crowd more than on the pitch..|`|QYfvgFsXaa	You're think about rugby from the 1980s there. In the modern game, the ref does let the game flow and he calls for an infringment only when it slows the game down, otherwise modern refs always play advantage.|`|kovBZS8saa	you obviously dont understand the game of rugby,your probably a little gay boy who doesnt like sport.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	What is rugby?|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	it is only boring to watch|`|91W8HrJiaa	I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that the players, coach, referees, admin, and fans have very little between the ears.|`|zDf186Xyaa	Rugby is Good if you want to use your physical strength, the game itself is quite interesting all i know is a team has get through the other side by finding a gap in the opposing team's defence.

The ref is actually trying to stop infringements to let the game flow more, although as in any sport, some ref's idea of their importance is over inflated.    It's better most good referees will tell the players to stop handling in the ruck (for example) before blowing up. It gives the player the option to stop and therefore let the game flow. Only when the player ignores him / continually breaks the laws will a good ref stop the game.|`|6QrnOBZVaa	get of the crack pipe|`|f6A6UM2taa	i disagree i find pretty easy on the eye!! lol|`|ehfe97Zcaa	The problem is that you've obviously got bugger all understanding of the game. Have you ever played it? Do you know the rules?     Infringing happens because teams are testing the referee to see how far they can bend the rules. If they didn't do that then the game would be boring. If there were no rules then it would just be a free for all, which would also blow.     The truth is you're probably just a troll who likes league or AFL or American football, and you're high fiving yourself while you try to bait people on the internet. That's pretty lame, I've gotta say.    Either way, if you don't like it then don't watch it. I'd be curious to know exactly what you think IS a good game though.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Go play the game. Odds are the ref stopped the game because someone got stamped on, punched or was offside. Someone could say "why do the refs in football always stop the game when something exciting is happening?"    And by "something exciting" i assume you mean a break through the defensive line. It happens a fair bit.    Just go and play it. Watch Rugby Union not rugby league. Its a lot more fast paced and exciting to watch.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	cause it's played by toffs,it's not a man's game like they make out to b e,i rather think it's a poofy game personally,all these toffs who goes to watch rugby think by drinking all day and singing sweet f**king chariot makes their day,i mean there is no humour or banter at these games,as for the girls who like their man beefy ,i rather ride a horse than ride them i mean when was the last time you saw a corker of a girl going out with a rugby player.|`|004191770d52d2dff11de585b12631dcaa	Never got rugby its all about kicking the ball out of play Football and Cricket are real sports.|`|Efns7sDLaa	I'm a 14 year old rugby player. Whilst I completely agree with you, I also disagree. Before I started to play the beautiful game, it seemed like a bunch of fat, sweaty blokes kicking the ball into the horizon whilst the crowd clapped them for losing the egg. It is actually a more complex and manly game than you think. As you said - The ref does stop the game a lot. That is not only to ensure player safety, but also to make the game more interesting. The ref's get more respect at rugby games and the environment at Twickenham is much more family friendly than that at, St James' Park say. As I have been to both of those stadiums to watch a competitive International, I can vouch for this. As for "Fat blokes singing swing low", at least our song is actually British. The national anthem was written BY a GERMAN for a GERMAN.

Si el gato esta rabioso, entonces pierde, porque ataca asi nada mas y no le sirve el karate, porque no lo aplica.  Si el gato esta calmado, pues podra usar el karate a voluntad.  Si el gato logra efectuar bien una mawashi geri o un gyaku tsuki con esas patitas.     Tambien depende de:    Si esta lloviendo o hace mucho viento. El gato estaria en desventaja.  Si estan en un lugar con muchos arboles grandes con muchas ramas; el gato no podria volar bien.

wErp93eFaa	por mi experiencia y prctica en ambas artes, te digo que tu pregunta no es factible, no por los contricantes, sino por que las artes son contrarias en su desenvolvimiento y aplicacin.    el aikido se resume en demostrar al atacante la ineficacia de su agresin utilizando la misma energia y fuerza que el agresor utiliza para su ataque pero en su contra, es decir, proyectando esa energa de tu agresor en la direccin que tu quieras, asia el frente, asia un lado, asia atrs o en su contra, tu no lo golpeas en realidad, el solito se noquea con su propia fuerza, tu slo proyectas la direccin de esa fuerza.    el jiujtsu es conocido tambin como la pelea callejera japonesa, en la cual tu derrivas a tu agresor a veces con su propia fuerza y otras por tu iniciativa cuando el te ataca, tambien en este arte marcial se te ense?a a utilizar todo lo que este a tu alcance para defenderte, por ejemplo, llega un ladrn te toma por la espalda y te dice que saques la cartera, tu lo que haces es tomar lo que tengas en tu bolsillo como llaves, y de esas empu?as una como pu?al, la sacas con un movimiento ya premeditado para esquivar su ataque y lo dems imagnatelo, pobre de tu atacante, y como herramientas que tu tienes a tu alcance y que puedes utlizar tienes llaves, celulares o un encendedor, ?haz utilizado un encendedor como refuerzo al hacer tu pu?o y pegarle a un costal?    pero lo importante y como ya muchos usuarios de esta seccin lo han dicho, lo importante no es el buscar enfrentar un arte contra otro, ni el buscar convertirnos por el aprendizaje de un arte en un arma mortal o un "jia joe" de accin, sino el entender la filosofa de paz y convivencia que hay en las artes, as como la condicin fsica y elasticidad que te queda; la defensa personal es una consecuencia de la prctica del arte.|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	En aikido no se gana, se hace desistir al oponente, creo que si hablamos de niveles similares de habilidad el triunfador es el aikidoka, por la simple y sencilla razon de que el practicante de ju jitsu sera el que tome la iniciativa y con ello se desgastara, el aikidoka jamas tomara actitud ofensiva, solo hara dar vueltas a sus oponentes hasta que se cansen o se lastimen solos.    Suerte.|`|a2c22536cd5bda250cdd4cf4c38b5385aa	no lo se pero creo ambas son buenas disciplinas pero creo que el aikidista puede llevarla de ganar. creo yo?|`|xFget4Doaa	Jiu-Jitsu es el ms importante arte marcial Japons, porque el moderno budo (arte marcial) del sistema de judo, Aikido, Nipn Shorinji y muchos sistemas de Karate-Do tienen sus races en Jiu-Jitsu.     Jiu-Jitsu puede llamarse " padre de artes ". Un padre de artes es un arte desde el cual otro Arte se desarrolla. El Jiu-Jitsu tiene histricamente tal nombre. En el Judo (la manera cortesana), Aikido (la manera de mente y poder) y el Karate (la mano vaca) puede verse la marca del Jiu-Jitsu. Muchos estilos de karate Kempo tomaron tambin algunas de sus tcnicas del Jiu-Jitsu.     Jiu-Jitsu llego a ser demasiado complejo o pudo ser considerado difcil para aprender ( Jigoro Kano y Morishei Ueshiba fundadores de Judo y el Aikido ) fueron capaces de simplificar y sistematizar su tcnicas Hay entre 30 a 50 movimientos bsicos en Jiu-Jitsu.    Sin embargo, son las combinaciones y variaciones de los movimientos bsicos lo que hace el arte tan complejo e infinita en su variedad de movimientos.     Si dividimos el arte en tres reas generales (Judo para lances y palancas, Karate para ataques y golpes, y Aikido para el uso de la fuerza del atacante), cada parte del arte sera ms fcil de ense?ar. Tambin sera ms fcil de organizar y perpetuar como sistema. Como ellos llegaron a ser ms fciles (en trminos relativos) para organizar y ense?ar, son tambin ms fciles y atractivos para el estudiante      con esto te quiero decir que el jujitsu es el mejor pero el mas complicado|`|AA11481777	el aikido es el camino de la paz, no es competitiva, aunque de todos modos, el aikido puede llegar a ser muy fuerte e incluso mortal.|`|xbJzWTg5aa	como tu mismo lo dices depende de la persona ya q ambos artes son muy buenos, pero a la vez son diferentes y si tienen el mismo grado y condiciones es tambien mas complicado de predecir, ambas artes tienen pros y contras al enfrentarse, es inpredecible|`|oUaMmFzmaa	mmm...yoga no?????|`|3dWGnnegaa	Estoy seguro que el ju jitsu se lleva las de ganar teniendo en cuenta que tiene una preparacin especificamente dirigida al combate real. No quita que el Aikido es una excelente arte marcial, particularmente me encanta, pero a mi juicio desde el vamos, el practicante no se expone a las situaciones de stress y exigencia tpica dada en los deportes de combate o artes enfocadas a lo deportivo. Por otro lado consider que es dificil encontrar a un aikidoka con el nivel fsico de preparacin que tiene un jujitsuka. Para finalizar antes de comparar entre dos disciplinas vera a que apunta cada una como finalidad, ya que en este caso, son bastante dispares.  Saludos.|`|ZRYk4Qosaa	Hola  Ningun peleador de Aikido se enfrentaria a nadie por demostrar nada, la finalidad de O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba al crear el Aikido era precisamente promover la armonia, no buscar peleas, de hecho las tecnicas del aikido se derivan principalmente del Jiu Jitsu, asi como del Karate y Iaido, por lo que en escencia aun mantienen muchos movimientos y tecnicas similares.  No creo que sea factible un combate asi, por lo menos no de parte de un autentico Aikidoka.  Suerte|`|5d6nkYkHaa	es una pregunta muy dificil de contestar pq son dos tecnicas, muy  eficaces en combate  pero me animo a responder , que es el jiu-jitsu. por la larga lista de luchadores que han tenido exito  en las jaulas.es conocida  la familia gracie , en brasil y el mundo .

La diferencia esta en que el judo esta mas orientado a la competicion y el ju jitsu esta mas orientado a la defensa personal.  Por lo que en el judo las tecnicas mas peligrosas se eliminaron.  Tal vez el judo sea incluso mas duro pues para competir se necesita mucho esfuerzo.

De toda esa experiencia, lo que te puedo decir, es que el Judo es un deporte no mucho mas brusco, de movimientos mas secos, se necesita mucho ingenio para ser bueno y ganar en los randori, ademas el JUDO desciende del jujitsu, se puede decir que perfecciona algunas tecnicas y las simplifica, digamos tambien que el jujitsu era un sistema de combate originalmente (en la antigedad) y el judo sin dejar de serlo, fue mas desarrollado en el aspecto deportivo por ser un arte marcial moderna.  Yo no creo que sea mejor o peor, para mi ninguna arte marcial es mejor o peor que otra, todo depende del arte-marcialista, del nivel de entrenamiento y de lo que estas buscando. Yo ahora practico taekwondo porque me divierte mas y me siento mas seguro  y respetado.  Si estas buscando mas el aspecto competitivo, el JUDO esta mucho mas desarrollado en el aspecto deportivo que el JUJITSU.  Y bueh podria seguir parlando pero creo que ya respondi tu pregunta, bueno espero que te sirva. ;)  QUIERO AGREGAR, PARA AQUELLOS QUE HABLAN DE OIDO NADA MAS, QUE EN EL JUDO EXISTEN TECNICAS LLAMADAS NEWASA QUE SON PARA TRABAJAR EN EL PISO, ESTAS INCLUYEN EXTRANGULACIONES, LLAVES, TORCEDURAS DE BRAZOS, TECNICAS MUY SIMILARES A LAS DEL JUJITSU. LO DIGO PORQUE PRACTIQUE JUDO DURANTE 2 A?OS, Y PASE CON EL MEJOR PROMEDIO  DE MI PROMOCIONA CINTO NARANJA. CREO QUE ESO ME DA UN POCO DE RESPALDO A LO QUE DIGO. SOLO EN LA PARTE DEPORTIVA, ESTAS TECNICAS SE DEBEN APLICAR MUY RAPIDAMENTE, DE LO CONTRARIO EL COMBATE SE REANUDA NUEVAMENTE CON LOS OPONENTES DE PIE.

Es un hobbie o en realidad te interesa competir o aprender a pelear? Te gustan los deportes de competencia o el full contact? Tienes facilidad para la lucha cuerpo a cuerpo? Te asusta o te da miedo pelear o que te golpeen? Tienes la disciplina y el tiempo necesario para dedicarselo a un arte marcial? Lo haces por decision y conviccion propia o por sugerencia o para tratar de impresionar a alguien?  Estas son las preguntas basicas que te debes responder tu mismo antes de tomar una decision acerca de que arte marcial elegir, y te repito lo mismo que les he sugerido a quienes hacen preguntas similares, prueba uno y otro y una vez que veas de que se trata cada uno entonces tu decidete por el que mas te guste, preguntarle a alguien mas que arte marcial elegir es como preguntarle a los demas que es lo que deberias escoger como carrera o profesion, y esa mi amigo es tu propia decision y de nadie mas.

CFm0u13Paa	Because they are politicians. Lying is their job. Its all part of a big power grab just like Hitler and all the others did. Our subversive politicians are doing the same thing, just moving a bit slower in order to fool the public. You have to admit they are pretty smart because it is clearly working very well.    Vangion - You're wrong about the intelligence part. They are highly intelligent. They are now doing (quite successfully) in a covert manner that which they found impossible to do in an overt manner. They have spread so much left wing propaganda over the years that any real American viewpoint is considered "right wing extreme". They have indoctrinated several generations of children to their Orwellian "newspeak" and have produced a populace that can't think straight and is easily led to any ridiculous end. They have invented welfare as a way of buying votes with my money, money that has been extorted from me in the form of taxes. I forget who said it but many decades ago a foreign "leader" stated that they would destroy America from within, that they would assume complete control of the USA without ever firing shot and we would never even know it was happening. We are well on our way to becoming a third world country. Make no mistake, they are highly intelligent and goal oriented.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	If they say it enough, there will be people who believe you can carry a machine gun in a purse.

Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."

They are "Lying Liberals"|`|wdR8pPH3aa	They do it to scare the sheeple into submission|`|vea6mqPZaa	It's rather a simple idea.    You have a group of people that have never seen a firearm used in any way other than for crime.    If you look at the numbers and the location those numbers come from you will see their reason.    Now, I am not attempting to stereotype any group here but look at the obamanations "home town" Chicago.    Chicago has a very large welfare/public housing population. As a whole the welfare public housing population has a tendency to be a higher crime rate than any other population group/area of any given town world wide.    Given this the Liberals who see the high crime rate as the end result need something/someone to blame. The see a failed program in the public housing and welfare and that failure is high crime.     So to save face for the failure they need something to blame that will shift the eyes from them to the other parties. The best thing for them to target is firearms as they are used in the crimes. So they shift the blame for the failed socialist inspired government housing programs to the more affluent firearm owners. The end result for us is a constant barrage of falsehoods about how dangerous firearms are.    Now I will concede, firearms are dangerous, however they are only as dangerous as YOU allow them to be.    In my opinion if you want to stop gun crime then enforce the 20,000 + laws we have now. If someone robs a store throw them in the slammer and forget they are there, don't plea them out for time served and all that crap that the liberal judges like to do.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	damn good question. i wish i knew. fear the government that fears your guns.|`|kzrpSuvmaa	Just to piss you off, sir.|`|AA10418855	not only liberals lie. they all do, any way the government knows that some day the americian people is going to wakeup and they are afraid of a revolution.|`|2Yxw6xpPaa	The anti gun campaign was actually main streamed by a republican after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, Sarah Brady, wife of  White house press secretary James Brady. The liberals grabbed the issue before Ron Reagan won the election for a second term and used it to help rally the liberals during the Clinton/ Bush election.   Gun control is actually one of the polarizing topics the politicians use to deflect attention from the more important, threatening subjects that could possibly undermine the government. Abortion is the another one, Christianity in schools, Stem cell research etc. These Issues are meant to deflect attention away from what is really wrong with our government, Politicians want to stay in power. and will subvert your basic freedoms to ensure the continuation of the status quo. The corporate lap dog Conservatives do not want term limits, the greedy  Lobbyists do not want oversight,and the corrupt Liberals do not want campaign reform or transparency. The greatest threat to your freedom was the so called Patriot act that curbed your rights to search and seizure, freedom of speech and a myriad of other rights you have been taking for granted.The greatest move to a socialist type government was the republican bailout of the economy. In a true capitalist system the weak giants fall and are in turn gobbled up by the smaller healthier companies that offer a better product/service through something called free market. Politics boils down to one question "What color tie do yo want the guy who will be lying to you for the next 4 years to be wearing?" Does it really matter? To answer the original question Its not really the liberals that want to take away your guns its the government, period. An armed man is a citizen, an unarmed man is a serf.|`|a3732a4cc6b459f36622c977e782136faa	They don't lie.  They have no idea that what they are so quick to spout off is not reality at all.

tFxNfvJgaa	You need to run really fast at 6 ft tall. practicing 6 hours means nothing unless you actually got what it takes to be a good basketball player. basketball IQ is also very important, so as you practice 6 hours a day be sure to read some basketball plays and watch a lot of NBA and read articles on how nba players get their motivation. You also need to put your basketball IQ in application by playing for a decent coach and playing a lot of basketball and discovering what you are good at and weak at and improving your weaknesses and maximizing on your strengths. I would look at Allen Iverson as a role model instead of copying Kobe Bryant's moves. On top of that, you need to work on your physical conditioning, improve your vertical leap to the max and foot speed to the max. Flexibility is one of the most important things in basketball because the best leapers are all very flexible, Vince Carter for example. You can also learn this by watching the best street dunkers in the world, at 5'9 5'10 they could dunk like an NBA player. The best street dunker can kick a ball off the backboard.  You need to especially work on your best strength and making it NBA worthy just so you can be useful to a team. Basketball is a team sport and it's all about winning so if you can't contribute to the team's winning by using your best strength you are unlikely to become a player for a good team. and last but not least, keep trying and never quit.

If you can put on like 25-30 pounds of muscle by next season, I'd say play corner, 'cause you're a little short to be a receiver.     You're too small to be a halfback. If you can throw the ball, you could maybe play QB... Lineman/Linebacker/Tight End/Etc... is off limits. If you can kick, try kicker or punter...    Too short to be a really productive receiver, and probably won't be strong enough to be a safety, so I'd say play corner.    If you can get yourself a little faster, a little stronger, a little heavier, a little taller, and work on jumping, you could be a decent corner.    Good luck.|`|HUpWMHVMaa	your a pretty small dude...no offense   so i think you would be a good quarterback, or a  wide receiver cause your pretty fast|`|PENDvm8Paa	i think your kinda short to be a cornerback and too small to be a saftey so i would say to gain some weight and keep up your speed to try and be a RB    try to at least be 135-150 pounds and keep up your speed or try to get faster so you can evade big defenders    since your kinda short my advice for workouts would be  1. work on having quick feet and agility  2. if you play running back  make sure you keep your shoulders low to the ground  3. GAIN SOME WEIGHT AND MUSCLE|`|24UPDIBTaa	Wow. You are so light. No laughing, just hard for me to picture.    If you have the speed that should come with being that weight, I'd say your best bet is slot receiver or returning on special teams.    Then try to add weight while training to maintain as much of that speed and agility as possible.    If you're not as fast as would be thought or don't want to gain weight, you can either try-out and see where the coaches place you or perhaps focus on something like second base/centerfield in baseball.    Best of luck to you.|`|jkvBUGRgaa	Manager, water boy, mascot, band

AA10842647	Bench Press    A million ways to improve, but all take work.    DO curls, with a curl bar with your hands facing in sets of 12 increasing by 10 lbs (2 fivers on each side) until you cannont get 12 reps then back down    ALTERNATE WITH   Triceps curls using the same bar straight over your head then lower to the back of your neck and lift up straight with your elbows pointed up with the same weight as the biceps curls.    Stop after each set and stretch your arms.  I went on the machine and did 10 pullups, then rotated my body around its axis and back 10 times like winding up head over heels.  You may need to work on this, tho, if you are heavy.  I weighed 180-250 when I did this, but was lighter at the beginning, and heaviest after 3 years of college ball.      Then I did 10-15 dips on the dip machine and back to the next weight.      Even when I was benching over 465 I still started my curls at 25 lbs and worked up to 185 so my off bench days were pretty full.  It took me about 3 hours to finish my routine, but my neck, shoulders, lats, deltoids and arms were massive and I never took roids or protein shakes or anything.      Finally, Only bench 2-3 times a week.  The other exercises are for the off days.  Do legs on your bench days and work your upper body on the other days.  Oh, when the bench moves up in weight, you might want to do wrist curls and hand drills because losing your grip at 400 lbs can kill you.  ALWAYS USE A SPOTTER!|`|1304a965a314052036f72a6fcd561da4aa	Since you are still young, work your chest with routinely.  If you want to build strength, then work out slowly, with more weight.  If you want to build endurance and then strength, modify your workouts...circuit train one day and work out slow with lots of weight the next time around.    http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html    Try this:  - warm up with decline bench press  - incline bench press  - chest dips    Try the decline bench with a bar and gradually add weight  Try to get 4 sets of 8-10 reps each exercise.  When it seems too easy, add more weight.    Try incline with barbells.  Work your way up as it gets easier.  You will get stronger with the more time you put into the weight room.    Since you are a lineman, I would work for speed in the weight room, and lift heavy with a spotter once a week on the chest.    I remember when I was younger me and my best friend would do a shot and then do as many push ups as we could do.    AND DON'T FORGET TO WORK OUT YOUR OPPOSITE MUSCLE GROUPS....in other words, when you do chest, do back the same day.    When you do biceps, do triceps on alternate sets.    Squats are the best thing to strengthen your legs, not the leg press......so as you see your teammates leg press, go do squats.    Other than that, good luck.|`|91864a157b94967d975eb601b1d46130aa	Steroids, ask Barry 'Balco" Bonds, it worked for him|`|2d6fd6474e0da575a34e87497d33e801aa	The best way to get your bench press up is by using heavy weights that you can't handle by yourself with a spotter. During one year I was able to get mine up by lifting with stronger guys. They were doing 425 (Four 45 plates each side) in sets and instead of taking all these weights off for me, they just took off a 45 lb plate from each side and spotted me doing 315 (Three 45 plates each side). The negative (lowering) part is what I did on my own, the positive (raising part) was where my huge friend would assist me. The lowering part is key for strength gaining.    Also, gradually increase weight for shoulder presses and tricep excercises since shoulders and triceps assist in bench presses. This will also increase your strength in the bench press. Meanwhile, increased bench presses will make your shoulders and triceps stronger, too. Start out with the larger muscles first, which would be chest, then go to shoulders and then triceps for your workout. I will suggest 1 hour 30 minutes.    Recommended reps with heavy weights: 6-8  You may only be able to do less reps with heavier weights and a spotter but the body will still have to grow to adapt when doing it regularly. Skip a day or 2 in between chest excercises to rest the muscle. Sometimes as much as with 3 or 4 days rest you may find yourself stronger during the next workout.    I have been lifting weights for many years, used to work in a gym, and have had friends and co-workers ask me to design special routines for them.|`|AA10789965	viagara or cialis...|`|AA12170560	Hey Josh,  If your bench press has flat lined...  don't forget the muscles that support your pecs. (pectoralis major = Chest muscles) when they lift:  Deltoid (Shoulders), (Latissimus dorsi)upper back, and the back sides of your upper arm (triceps).    On your light days pump out push ups from three angles...also do dips.  On your heavy days make sure you complete at least 3 reps per set and make sure you comlete 5 sets.|`|d3ff4e9b017372a92d5b1dffa4e7b4f6aa	do it every other day-and be carefull-eat protien and no steroids  and for your heart -let Jesus in to forgive sins and be your friend-amen-he will keep you doing right off the field so u can be your best on the football squad pressin-too peace david|`|3ce3df1b6d3b1f15d9ef7d90ef9280ceaa	Of course, always have a spotter.

wnZ0N3wjaa	Powerplay was introduced to cricket as an advantage to batting team and a restriction to the fielding team only having 2 men out in the first block of PP (Overs 1-10) which consists of ten overs obviously.    Bowling powerplay is a 5 over powerplay taken at any time by the fielding captain whereas 3 men is allowed outside the fielding circle (Usually taken in overs 11-15).    The batting powerplay (again a 5 over powerplay) can be taken at any time by the batting captain where again only 3 men are allowed outside the circle and is usually of great advantage to the batting team if used correctly and with the right batters, 45+ runs is usually accpetable in the batting powerplay, the team batting second will benefit the most as they will get to time their powerplay while the team batting first has to take it on a gut feeling. (Usually taken between overs 30 to 45)|`|AA11088802	when field restriction that only 3 man field outside the circle|`|tTv8fpVbaa	In cricket, lets say a ODI match:    A powerplay is a period of 5 or 10 overs in which restrictions for the fielding team are put into place. For the first 10 overs, no more than 2 fielders are allowed outside the inner Circle. The bowling team and batting team each also choose a 5 over period during the game in which only three fielders are allowed outside the inner circle.    This benefits the batting side as if they hit the ball over the inner circle, they have less chance of being caught. Sometimes it will affect them badly as if they are trying to hit big shots, they can mishit one or get out.    Hope this helped|`|dqPdoiSYaa	Too big to write, so read it yourself.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(...|`|M2PVWLR8aa	Itis where the fielding team is only aloud up to 3 players outside the inner ring for five overs.

xhPKkkELaa	What makes you think you could hack a career in one of the most dangerous jobs in the world? You can make big money, but your not going to be sitting in a fighting chair cranking in a marlin. You will be working 12/18/24 hour days in extreme heat, numbing cold and deadly seas. Working all the time on a smelly, often poorly maintained death trap. The "Perfect Storm" wasn't just a neat movie, it was a true story.    For a number of years, I lived by the sea, and knew hard working, hard drinking commercial fisherman. And I know the the ones who didn't come back, and the names on the Cape May fisherman's monument. And my son, a Coast Guardsmen, knows the ones he never found. And, of course he knows the ones he arrested for illegal fishing, seizing their whole catch and leaving them broke after weeks of back breaking work.  It is a rough job for a rough man, who is prepared to die on any trip.     I earned my keep on the ocean for a while, and I'll tell you, the hardest maritime job there is, is being a commercial fisherman. If you can hack it, go to the docks in any fishing port, Cape May, Gloucester, Charleston to name some on the east coast of the US, a find a captain who will sign you on.|`|KvGrv2OFaa	go down to the quay and ask other fishermen, or maybe the local fisherman's mission, pubs or the local greasy spoon

mwxKnUleaa	I really do think he will in fact be a cowboy next season. They don't have much depth at the wide receiver position. You can say Roy Williams will take his place, but they still have not found out how to use him, so they don't know what to expect. As for Owens, though he has had trouble with his teams he is a solid receiver that loves to play and is able to compete at a very high level.|`|b160a8b1deff211832aed616290c0e68aa	I don't think so. if dallas is serious about cleaning up their locker room and installing some leadership and positive attitude on the team then TO will have to go.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	You could check out the Fan Forum at WWE Fan Nation for a few more ideas on that.<br>  <a href="http://fans.wwe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fans.wwe.com/</a>|`|SsodRf4kaa	true|`|EkKTyDCeaa	I agree. One of the best wrestlmania matches I ever saw was Randy Savage vs Ricky the Dragon Steamboat for the IC title. Those titles used to mean something and they could easily set the stage for new heavyweight champion contenders. Look at Bret Hart. It wasnt til he showed that he could main event a summerslam with The British Bulldog for the IC title that he was even considered to carry the wwf as the heavyweight champion. All titles need to be defended at at least the big ppv's like summerslam survivor series and wrestlemania even the royal rumble.|`|4YcZv0d7aa	I remember when the IC title was fought for. I mean they would claw and scratch their way to be an Intercontinental Title holder. You would see their interviews between matches and you would hear them yelling and screaming over, not the Heavyweight title, but the IC title. Ultimate Warrior was one that would really show his emotion for the title, even though it was steroid fueled. <br>  <br>  It wasn't until recently that the Intercontinental title has been a bigger commodity. CM Punk said it himself before he won it. He wants to put the honor back in the IC title. If anyone can, I think it would be CM Punk to bring it back into the light. I haven't heard much about the US title, but the IC title is more known. <br>  <br>  I remember when PPVs would have two Main Events. Many regular matches or grudge matches, then the IC title followed by the Heavyweight title. That was when wrestling was really great to watch. Longer matches with a lot of action. Back when a finisher was the end, and nobody kicked out of a simple flying elbow or leg drop.<br>  <br>  I really miss those days.|`|dfa0f01ddc47bcc3204c49cdd5bfbe9daa	what you talking about?? the IC just switched from regal to punk to regal and back to punk. the last time a title was defended at a PPV was when the US title was defended at backlash '08 when Matt hardy won the title from MVP.|`|qbEeecndaa	ic title just changed|`|Wu1PXYbGaa	CM PUNK just won the tittle in his home town of Chicago..I agree that the IC Tittle has lost it's meaning,in other day it was an honor to be the IC Champ but now a days clowns like Santino Marella and William Regal are champions..I hope cm punk bring the honor back to the title

8Bu8pZbraa	I knew it!! I KNEW that there was some smart steeler fans out there, they were just hard to find thats all.<br>  <br>  Yes, the defense and Holmes are MUCH more responsible for the win than Roethlisberger. Remember how Big Ben had 7 (!!!!) chances to get into the end zone from inside the 10 (due to an Arizona penalty), but failed miserably? I do think he is as good as Eli Manning, but thats not really saying much, since they both are not as good as Rivers and Warner, and are leagues below Brady and Manning.<br>  <br>  Its that simple|`|dPbZeAYVaa	I agree man.  Rivers, Brees, Manning, Warner are all better QB's.  The best label i can put on Roethlisberger is a "system" QB.  He really fits into the Steelers scheme well.  That defense is so good, win most of the games for the team that Ben really doesn't have to do much.  He isn't asked to carry the team.  Rivers however, was the only player i saw last season on the Chargers team that played every play, and all season long.|`|AA12220784	As an avid Steelers fan , I don't tear down or build up anyone player, but I do think Ben did a great job.  If it wasn't for that job, Holmes wouldn't have done what he done and the o line kept Ben upright, which took them 95% of the season to learn how to do.  I think they all did their part.  So, lets not ask these questions, but relish the victroy, they don't come all that often.|`|JTSNljLhaa	I find it silly that some fans think he is as good as manning, brees, rivers, or warner<br>  <br>  one of them dont belong on that list<br>  <br>  and yes people gave big ben alot of credit|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Too bad not all the Steeler fans are as smart as you.

"ben failed to score a touchdown in the first red zone drives in Q1 and Q3".  did it occur to you that perhaps some of the other guys on the field may have missed an assignment causing the play to fail?  are those other 10 players on the field simply there to watch?  everyone has a job to do, and if one person fails then the whole thing fails.  only an idiot would blame that on the QB, unless it was an obvious mistake made by the QB.  <br>  <br>  i personally have not compared him to the likes of manning, brees, rivers or warner for the simple fact that he IS NOT manning, brees, rivers, or warner.  he has an entirely different style of play than any of those pocket passers do.  you're sucked up into those pretty stats that QB's like you mentioned have.  football is not a pretty sport.  most of the time pretty numbers mean sh*t.  where did brees' 5,000 yard season get him?  a mediocre .500 season finish.  nice.  <br>  <br>  the only other QB who MAY have executed that last drive of the superbowl would be mcnabb.  ben's ability to leave the pocket and keep the play alive is what separates him from the QB's you consider "better". <br>  <br>  i'm not saying ben is perfect because he isn't, but he is a perfect fit for his team.  and here you sit pissing on your 5th year QB that has yet to even peak in his career.  ben led 5 4th Q comebacks this season.  do you know how many games the chargers lost by 3 or less points this season?  6.  a good QB wins those games for his team.  but wait, didn't you say rivers was better than ben? <br>  <br>  the fact is there were all sorts of things that had to go in favor of the steelers for them to win that game and to discredit ben as having nothing to do with any of them is unfair and completely untrue.|`|9vq0oSD2aa	First of all, I highly doubt you are a Steelers fan, since you can't spell "Roethlisberger" or the fact that you don't know that the WRs name is Santonio Holmes, not Santana.<br>  <br>  As for Ben, that last drive was epic, the Cards left too much time on the clock. You also must have missed the ENTIRE Pittsburgh 2008 season. They were horrible in the RZ all year, until there was about 5 minutes or less in the game to go. Plus the throw was perfect. There were 3 Cards defenders, and Ben said himself on Letterman that he thought it was picked. True, Holmes made one hell of a catch, but the throw was absolute perfection.<br>  <br>  For fantasy football, you can have your Mannings, Brees, Rivers, or Warner (and NE QB will be back this season), but behind that OL, all those guys go 8-8, at best.|`|4XdevoVwaa	No he had a big part in the win.|`|BwhMgmxFaa	I actually skinned Ben and wore him during the superbowl so you owe me the credit.|`|sSOqEzqxaa	I FIND THIS QUESTION SILLY!|`|Ch9TedMcaa	O God, another hater.<br>  <br>  Santana Holmes?

His abilty to get plays done outside the pocket sets him aside from the numerous quarterbacks in this league.

One minute he's a one hit wonder who holds onto the ball too long and costs his team games, the next he's the greatest quarterback in the NFL and is gifted with the ability to hold onto the ball long enough to keep plays alive.  I have nothing against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but I just find it amazing how fickle the majority of it's fan base can be.
1YV3e1ZEaa	Overrated- Reggie Bush. I am sick of hearing about how incredibly fantastic he is. There's a million other RBs out there that could mop the floor with him.<br>  <br>  Underrated- This is going to get me some thumbs down, but I have to say it. Eli. BUT, only because I think he gets unfairly judged because of his last name. It's easy to remember that he's related to great players like Peyton and Archie. But, it's hard to remember that he hasn't played nearly as long as either of them. I think Peyt has more natural talent, but Eli will get better as he plays more I really believe. And, people make him out to be a really BAD football player, which he is not.|`|e2u46Tgpaa	of alltime is deff trent green..every year he was doing great he wasnt heard of because he came behind peyton manning in everything for like 2-3 years. he almost won mvp i believe..also 4 a while marc buldger..now he just sucks. i also agree steve breaston. and a fullback on the seahawks named owen schmitt, whenever he has the ball he gets alot of yards.<br>  <br>  <br>  overrated= reggie bush, chad johnson, michael vick was all he did was run the ball|`|AA11460485	Overrated- Brian Westbrook.

He's a good receiver, but his mouth gets in the way. And that's exactly how the media perceives him. No one's saying he's the best in the league or anything to that effect.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say who is the MOST overrated, because there are many average players the media embraces. I think the Giants offensive line is very overrated. A writer for ESPN the Magazine said they deserved the MVP honors this year. Don't get me wrong, they're one of the best run-blocking groups I've ever seen. But they also allowed Eli Manning to be sacked 8 times in one game. That's very bad, most lines struggling with injuries and starting rookies can do a better job than that.<br>  <br>  I think Chad Pennington is the most underrated. He had the 2nd best QB rating and best completion percentage during the 2008 regular season, throwing to sub-par receivers that most people have never even heard of. But all we heard from analysts was "Pennington doesn't have a strong arm." I'd call that underrated.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I totally disagree with you about chad johnson. Chad Johnson gets double coverage and that's why T.J. is so good. He had a down season because of a torn labrum and Carson only played 4 games. You can't argue with his numbers. He is rated just right. He is an elite receiver.<br>  <br>  Reggie Bush is definatly the most overrated player.<br>  Calvin Johnson is the most underrated.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Overrated: Kurt Warner, I could put up those numbers with Holt, Bruce, and Faulk in their prime, and/or Boldin, Fitz, and Breastin.<br>  <br>  Underrated: Wes Welker, a lot of people claim Randy Moss is the reason Welker gets open, but Welker is actually the reason Moss gets single coverage.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Wait, Fitzgerald underrated ? They're already calling him the next Cris Carter.<br>  <br>  Overrated - Eli Manning<br>  Underrated - Steve Breaston
cf097e014c6acfacb1c669aa3ee29effaa	It seems really obvious to say yes because, lets face it, LBJ has been an elite player since he was about 15. They televised his high school games NATIONALLY and Shaq actually attended a couple. Yes, Shaquille O'Neal at the height of his fame went to a high school to watch what he termed 'The Future'. But, despite this, Lebron is NOT invincible. <br>  I actually think he has been REALLY lucky not to sustain a major injury and think (due to the dynamic and up-tempo style of his play) that he is long overdue a big injury. If he tears his ACL or damages his back or knees (in particular) he may be forced to miss major time or (God forbid) retire completely, in which case he would NOT make it to the Hall of Fame. I believe he WILL win a ring in the next few seasons but, even if he doesn't, I think his numbers and overall contribution to the popularity of basketball will earn him a place.<br>  Great question and not as obvious as it may seem.<br>  Peace.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Michael Jordan won his first ring when he was 28 y/o (took 6 years to do it) and LeBron James is just 24 (his 6th year in the NBA) and Cleveland Cavaliers is a big threat on other teams in the East when playoff time comes.

ujMsLUcNaa	Well said Don Imus.  Hoopfan, if you're still the same unbias NBA intellectual I remember then you would give Don Imus the BA for this question.  Passion for the game is what separates Magic, Bird, and Jordan from the rest of NBA superstars of today.  Without love for the game, there is no desire: to improve after you achieve All-Star status, to prove all your harshest critiques wrong, and to continue playing even when your body can no longer handle the daily grind of a demanding NBA schedule.|`|BntHQeWMaa	what was dominant about luc longley??? i watched the majority of the bulls games in the 90s..longley willington(sp) williams and any other so called center or statue for them was not dominant.<br>  <br>  <br>  longley was not dominant tho..bottom line.. 'as dominant as he was'|`|FUoKu13Daa	luc longley was like a Chris Kaman type center who was good but he was way far from being anything special as a player,<br>  <br>  Gasol is 3 times the player the Luc Longley was.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Luc Longley is not as dominant as you think, even if you put Bill Wennington on his place, the Bulls would still win their last 3-peat.|`|aVkoNhvPaa	1) He is not overrated. Wilt was a great scorer...but Wilt was not a great Winner.<br>  <br>  2)Jordan did win six rings with one of the best all around player's (PiP).<br>  But look at Bird or Magic's roster's when they were winning.They had 3-4 HOF on there roster and won less.Celtics had the greatest front line ever!<br>  <br>  3)Yes the bulls still played well after Jordan retired .... Pip had a lot to do with that...bottom line they couldn't get it done.They couldn't close the deal......what separates good from great ?..closing the deal and winning the championship.If anything that proved Pippen is underrated.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Bird played with a lot of HOF..from Mchale, Parish,Walton and Tiny (?hof)to Maxwell (?hof) he won 3 rings.<br>  <br>  Bird is a great player..Jordan is a little(2 rings) better.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Jordan's has 3 ring's on Bird..1 on Magic.You can't compare era's....from Clyde.Barkley,Magic,Stock/Malone to Payton/kemp he played some great teams.....anyways I don't think it's about the stats with Jordan.He had something special, I don't know exactly what ,but I know it was there.He connected to more people then any athlete ever...that's what really made him great.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  The fact we are even talking about him now ..means he's the greatest......<br>  <br>  The question is why was he the most marketed athlete?When you answer that, you will find out why he is great<br>  <br>  He was a underdog who became a champion amongst champions! The greatest ever!......................<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  <br>  We are the fans who love the game of basketball.We are the ones who dream of last second shot's to win the game....We are the ones who dream of being on "fire" in the NBA finals..We imagine soaring through the air and dunking...We are the fan's..we are the ones who have the love for the game.<br>  <br>  Michael Jordan will always be that kid dreaming.....something inside him made him never forget his love for the game.He will always be that fan dreaming of becoming a champion....he will always be just one of us.<br>  This is what made him great.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Pure skill and a undying love for the game, made him arguably the greatest ever............so let's recap..<br>  He's great..the most entertaining player ever(you said it).He is a champion(second to only "the great Bill russell")he is the second greatest scorer(behind Wilt) Appealed to more people and was marketed to more people then any other ATHLETE in HISTORY!<br>  <br>  .So how in the hell is he overrated?....hope you have more then meaningless stats and a 5yrs without PiP.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Of course if Jordan didn't have great teammates he would have been a great player with no rings...similar to D.Wilkens<br>  <br>  In order to be considered the greatest you have to be a NBA champion.Would MJ be a champion without Pip?...no.Would Magic be a champion without Kareem?..doubt it How about Bird without Parish etc... All these great players had pure skill and they were blessed to have great teammates also.With skill, love for the game and great teammates they all had a chance to become champions....and all three ,Bird,Magic and Jordan capitolized on it.......that's what separated them from thier peers.Then Jordan separated himself from them...when you look at his whole body of work (his winning,his legacy,his stats, but MOST! importantly who he is) he is the greatest|`|Vep76FT9aa	he wasnt dominate fool!<br>  he was just a good role player. jordan made him better|`|i5MInqeMaa	I think any below average center could average great stats in the lakers triangle offense as long as you got a facilitator like pau gasol.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Longley wasn't dominant you fool!

Over the past 25 years, accomodations have been made to placate the african american athlete.  The game is designed for teamwork and skill, yet the game has evolved into a one on one isolation game and over emphasis on the inside power game.  The rules have been adapted to mimic the playground, almost never call "Palming" or "Traveling".  For many rookies, the dunk and 3ptr are thier only shots.  Almost nobody has an intermediate jumper anymore, because it is percieved as weak. If you were to go back to the rules in effect in 1969, you would see a much different game today.  More players would have to rely on passing and hitting the open man, instead of setting up one side of the floor for an isolation.  The pick and roll we see today would almost be non-existant. You would see fewer fouls, as the need to do so would be replaced with actual defense.  Finally, there has been talk of raising the rim, but who would it effect the most, those guys for whom the dunk is thier primary scoring tool.  Most of whom are african american and I am sure it would be considered unfair to them, to actually develop basketball skill instead of levitation skills.|`|uFqkgwhQaa	They got talents and skills|`|BIyJUmM9aa	No, it was made for everyone<br>  <br>  =]]|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	It was developed by James Naismith for an all-white boy's academy but AFRO-AMERICANS DOMINATED THIS SPORT.

88103a6a36a9b90ac1b1f7272254b250aa	The West Coast offense is an offense in which a lot of short passes are used.  Typically, in today's game, it's a team that uses the pas to set up the run.  In a west coast offense, because of the pass, defenses must spread out to cover the wide receivers and the RBs coming out of the back field, this opens up holes to run.  <br>  The West Coast offense was developed in the 1980s.  It was made famous by the San Francisco 49ers under Bill Walsh and was also a term given to the Offenses led by Don Coryell throughout his coaching career.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Bill Walsh with the SF 49ers generally receives credit for bringing the WCO to the pros.  The offense puts more emphasis on a quick, short passing game.  Running backs are expected to be able to catch as well as run.  Players like Montana, Young, Rice, Craig were all part of making the offense work in SF.<br>  <br>  Almost all pro-teams have incorporated the concepts of the WCO in some way or fashion into their offense.|`|z6pdWKa5aa	Not sure about NFL, but I do know what kind of offense it is. They had it at Auburn a few years ago. In 2004 it was successful (AU went 13-0), in 2005 it was good, in 2006 it was bad and in 2007 it was drop-dead horrible. It is pounding the ball and throwing short passes. Conservative but can be very successful if ran right.|`|jIONJZSJaa	I can't tell you who originated it, but Bill Walsh made it popular.  It basically means that all your skill position players, WR, TE, RB, and FB, must be able to catch the ball.  Most teams in the league run some variation of the "West Coast Offense".|`|ffbdabbffdb4f137c60d520c03bfb483aa	Bill Walsh originated it.<br>  <br>  basically focuses on short passes more than short runs|`|qsKOlpUyaa	Warrior and david w both seem to be right and I think david w did point out the possession factor.|`|4kdlE54Paa	To add to what everyone has said about Bill Walsh and his revolutionary West Coast Offense, many coaches have created hybrid versions of it too.  Check out the link about Bill Walsh and pay extra close attention to the Bill Walsh Coaching Tree.  It is quite amazing where a lot of these great coaches came from.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(football_coach)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_...</a><br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	lot of passing|`|FtkoBEVpaa	The "West Coast Offense" was invented by Sid Gilman of the Chargers (AFL) in the early to mid-60s.  Though it wasn't called the West Coast Offense until Bill Parcells refered to it as such in a post-game interview after he led the Giants to victory over Bill Walsh's 49ers in the 1985 playoffs.  The early offensive scheme was to establish a solid run game and draw the defense to the line of scrimmage and then take advantage of that through the air via deep pass patterns.  The offense today, as popularized by Walsh and the 49ers, uses short pass patterns to spread the defense out laterally and open up vertical passing lanes.|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	The true WCO was Gillman's fire away mentality in the early 60's while coach of the Chargers.  Coryell adapted it to produce the NFL's first team with 3 1,000 yard receivers (Jefferson, Winslow and Joiner in the early 80s)<br>  <br>  Walsh developed the Cincinnati offense while QB coach /OC of the Bengals under Paul Brown in the early 70s and made stars of Ken Anderson (1974 MVP) and Bob Trumpy.  Had Brown not promised Bill "Tiger" Johnson the HC after his retirement the ball control passing game would be referred to as the Bengal offense.<br>  <br>  The ultimate goal is scoring, but if no score then hold the ball for four minutes at a time with pinpointed passes and allowing the QB, RBs and Receivers to read plays as they develop and make adjustments to the defense's reactions.<br>  <br>  Almost every NFL coach uses some form of this offense because HS and NCAA/ NAIA coaches do not teach run blocking.|`|AA12170560	First - Bill Walsh is the father of the West Coast Offense.<br>  <br>  he had no idea it would ever work and he utilized it for an entire season before the press asked him about his unusual game plan...<br>  boxed in...he just threw it out there that it was a West Coast Offense...<br>  <br>  It wasn't just about short passes...<br>  it's about gaining 4 or more yards per play...<br>  using the clock to your advantage...<br>  capitalizing on controlling the ball...<br>  keeping the defense guess and steering clear of age old traditions like passing on second and long.<br>  <br>  short passes and out of bounds to stop the clock...<br>  short passes and staying in bounds to keep it running<br>  alternating sides of the field and using the wide side as the "12th man"<br>  <br>  and yes to my fellow 49er fan, simplifying the passing tree and utilizing multiple receivers (to include running backs).<br>  <br>  Yes, you can Wikepedia WCO - <br>  but the idea was short outs and ball control...keeping the chains moving and dominating the clock and possession time.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	The West Coast Offense is about short passes to control the football...and the line of scrimmage...<br>  <br>  Bill Walsh was the one that perfected the West Coast offense in the '80s with the 49ers...

n8UBfhgpaa	Le'Ron McClain is the best in the league right now, hands down!! The reason why you dont see fullbacks break out anymore though is because most teams are using double Tight Ends instead of a fullback.
