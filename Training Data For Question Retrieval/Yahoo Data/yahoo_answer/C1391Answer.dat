I am a bit shy. Some people get very shy because they might have been abused or laughed at in some point of their life's, when they were trying to speak up. Some people are shy because they have less self-confidence than others.|`|MLSAWWbRaa	People can be shy if they have low self esteem or low confidence.|`|WdomchnPaa	people are shy because they are very self conscious and don't want show their real selves because of humility and what makes a person like that is low self esteem, being made fun of, or abuse|`|DbuDaEqnaa	I don't think shy people are necessarily born that way. It would mostly be down to their childhood experiences, what environment they were in, what their parents were like. Most shy people have shy parents. I think shy people have a fear of rejection. Maybe they were rejected for being outgoing early on or maybe they just learnt the 'shy' behaviour.

bjqjkDMHaa	Talk to a therapist about this, it sounds like you are really obsessing over it, which is not normal.  It's normal for people to be greedy and selfish, humankind had to be self-centered for centuries way back when we were cave people, and that still comes out a lot, unfortunately, even though our survival doesn't depend on every tiny piece of food or everything we have.  But it isn't normal for people to obsess over that. People are all cynics, I'm a cynic, you're a cynic, now humankind has developed the self-awareness and morals to realize it's better to be nice and giving, but obsessing over morals isn't normal, it hurts you because you're overthinking it, although by no fault of your own.  You might have a sort of OCD or anxiety disorder, maybe a phobia or two, so it would be best if you talked to an expert about this. Like, a shrink.|`|0uDuXHtcaa	Don't be afraid to give people things if they deserve it, but its not like anyones asking you to throw money all over the road.

IrCgBfSqaa	Jada Pinkens famous Actress and also known as Will Smith's Wife said at a Donation Meeting at a House for the Homeless Church in Los Angeles "Your most powerful weapon, is your mind, because you can kill every thought that controls your life" Dave Pelzer author of the book "A Child Call It" and five best selling books and an Activist said "We all have problem right well guess what Nothing can conquer or dominant the human spirit period" This are the words of a child who was the victim of the worse case of child abuse of ALL TIMES in the state of California. Christopher Gardner autobiography by Will Smith in the movie "The Pursuit of Happyness" was taken out of his house, naked, in the middle of the snow, at gunpoint by his stepfather on Chistmas Eve becuase her mother only bought one gift for his son and not for her dunk, good for nothing husband, despite the fact that her mother was also an acoloholic/child abuser. If you saw the movie you the how his story continues. Ophra Winfrey raped for many years starting from the age of 9 by her cousin, uncle, and family FRIENDS, and I think we all know how she turn out. With all do respect to your question, but these cases of these people are not just spanking with the belt. I'm talking about Dave Pelzer for those of you who know him, this 7 year old boy was stabbed by her own mother, put in room with amonia "The Gas Chamber", at the age of 12 he weight 62 pounds, and he was abused near death every single day for the first 12 years of his life. <br>  <br>  And yet these people made the choice to become NOTHING like their parents. The key word here is CHOICE, you can either choose to become an abuser, rapist, alcoholic, murderer, or you can choose, to Thank God because you are still alive, and made the best of it. I know is hard, very hard to go on with your life after been abuse by your parents, but realistically speaking a parent can only teach what they know, but you can make the choice of not going through your life not knowing. From a lot of points of views is justify to become a child abuser (because your parents were, then you are going to become one), and I'm a strong believer that more than your parents abuse, society has labeled you as an abuser from the moment society knew, you were abuse as a child. As a matter of fact, society expects you to become a child abuser, so they can make a story about you. No people this is wrong!! We as people need to encourage our young kids in our societies that no matter what they go through in life, they SHOULD NOT LET THOUGHTS, MEMORIES, AND PEOPLE CONTROL THEIR LIVES. And that there is only one way to achieved this and is Through God.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I think you are right to some degree, people come from generations of abuse.  There is a new generation that has decided to stop having children so that the abuse stops with them.  I think you have to make a stand to stop the madness.  Many kids in abusive homes make pacts to not have kids, so the abuse ends.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	It happens more often this way, but it doesn't mean they always will.|`|uojR7vmEaa	i think it could go both ways.Parents are our mentors so sometimes we think its ok to do the stuff they do so sometimes it may go bad and  the child was abused they may think that is how it is supose to be so therefore they abuse their children.I also think it could go the other way because they may think to themself i never want to be like my parents and i never want to do that stuff to my children and they learn that their parents were in the wrong.There are three forms of abuse in my opinion.<br>  1. phisical <br>  2.mental ruining the childs mind<br>  example "You will never amount to nothing<br>  3.emotional<br>  which could also connect to mental <br>  4.sexual which in my opinion is so sick<br>  <br>  and i love children and babys and i feel so bad for the ones who ae abused and it could cause sevie stuff such as suicide and depression.I know i would never event think of hitting a child or a baby or saying anything to hurt them.|`|TlU3zj61aa	I think that this is unlikely.

AA10584077	Hey, I don't blame you, I would have laughed, too. Not out of shared camaraderie or genuine humor, but out of pity and "I can't believe you just said that, tool" disbelief.<br>  <br>  I couldn't really give two squirts of piss about Women's History month or Black History month as a political correctness exercise, but it's the spirit of the celebrations that should count. And I'm willing to bet that any guy who says that women "should get over it" is not strictly referring to Women's History month; he's actually referring to modern womens' audacity to complain that things that are still unequal.<br>  <br>  I'd keep an eye on Captain Bootstraps if I were you.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Things like Women's month and Women's day are just feel-good tactics used by politicians to get the vote of women and minorities, and to victimize these people in the pretence of giving 'attention' to their problems.<br>  <br>  Everyone should be demanding that women be respected and treated equally all the 365 days. As far as many people are concerned, today is meant to give mock sympathy to women and buy women gifts, and forget about women's problems the next day.<br>  <br>  The idea of women's day is also sexist because it implies that women should be celebrated, while men need not be. It goes against the idea of equality, implying that women are better than men.<br>  <br>  All in all, your supervisor is spot on.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I think women have come a long way and deserve to be acknowledged for their great strides and successes. I guess it's just that everyone wants to have a special week or month devoted to their cause. Things like cancer awareness, black history month, etc. are viable reasons to stop and reflect on those areas. It seems that people are getting tired of everyone wanting to have a holiday or special time set aside for their cause. Women have played a huge part in the history of our country and are almost 1/2 of the workforce today, so I think they deserve to be honored and historical women remembered for their part.|`|p6gDNa3laa	Actually, I don't see a whole lot of people complaining about past oppression.  Only a few die-hard fanatics that seem that seem to get a lot of publicity, older individuals who grew up in a different time or people who just want to identify with a group for acceptance.  It's funny how a lot of people who have never never faced oppression behave as if they do because of things that happened long before they we're born.<br>  <br>  It still happens in other places, but still people who have never faced it, act as if they are the ones dealing with it.|`|1suTgWGoaa	It was, it is and still for short time will be a “good” business for many.<br>  <br>  The whole their "story" is a business, from feminists waves to vagina day.<br>  <br>  From “women study” to “women history”.<br>  <br>  Now there is almost nothing  left from women, which has not been soled in markets.<br>  <br>  Nice job feminists. <br>  now they feel that it is over, sure what else do you want to sell?|`|U1fToGvZaa	Yes. It's just a month... Besides, why do we need the approval of everyone to celebrate who we are? <br>  <br>  I really do not understand why we -- women, blacks, whites, whatever -- continue emphasizing our differences if we want to be seen and treated as equal. Seems counterproductive to me.|`|NnG8PxMzaa	I don't believe things like that should be necessary.  Rather than going on and on about the past of individual groups we should be trying to make the future better for all people.|`|3862H0WVaa	Well if there was a man's history month I would find it embarrassing and I think many women find this a bit over the top for modern tastes.<br>  so yes I would say many women need to get over it as it is becoming very silly now.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I think women can get over the things we've accomplished and celebrate them, but obviously sexism and sexual harassment aren't gone, or we wouldn't continue to have 1,000's of EEOC gender discrimination law suits filed every year. If the ppl sexually and racially discriminating against others would grow up and "get over it" there'd be a lot more to celebrate and a lot less to "get over". Maybe we can just fire these cretins and we could all "get over it". I think your boss is a prime candidate for firing if he isn't on the look out for both appropriate and inappropriate behavior by both his female and male staff. EEOC and Sex based discrimination: <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/types/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eeoc.gov/types/sex.html</a><br>  <br>   I celebrate the advances that have been made by the lgbt community, too, but in the US you can still be fired for being lgbt in most states, so I'd say quite a few ppl need to get over discriminating.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I wouldn't have found it offensive either, since the things that morons say seldom offend me.  I think that we should learn from our history and work towards changing the future.<br>  <br>  In other words, instead of a woman saying, "I didn't get the promotion because I"m a female, oh well", she should fight and get what she wants.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Can anyone explain how having a Women's History month helps business?  It's not like they have cards or anything.  Hell, most people don't even know when it is.|`|AA11589988	There is still plenty of oppression of women but it's happening in the middle east and in Africa and not in America or Europe.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Just like the blacks should get over slavery and move on.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Yes, call it a day and move on.|`|qVmIokXPaa	There's no such thing ; what they need to get over is this false " oppression theory " which is as exhausted as them african people's oppression theory & their false claim to a month that isn't recognized.. Furthermore, rather than laughing at any man who is undoubtedly your superior, you should be whole heartedly in support of his wise summation of such a foolish concept. He clearly controls your future at this point..|`|4F8b4D6Laa	As far as I knew, march 8 was women's day and that was it. Why should we eliminate women's month? Business people wouldn't like it, imagine how much money is made from each celebration like that?<br>  <br>  Getting over the oppression would be nice, that's what women have been trying to do since hundreds of years ago, if he thinks we're going slow, see what he can do about it to help.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm sure many women take it seriously and would want their boyfriends to "acknowledge" it, to demonstrate they're taking it seriously by buying something special for them. There are more women that like to make excuses for receiving gifts than you suspect. What about radical feminists? They too must make some deal out of it.Either way, why should anyone bother to eliminate women's month at all? It's vain effort, it wouldn't make any good.<br>  <br>  I know if I'm ever supposed to work on bussines, women's month is not an opportunity I'd miss, I'd make a big point on how women have advanced in terms of equality and having value, and how they deserve the best gifts from it. Just like they do with march 8. Lots of shameless propaganda to make money.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	I agree. I'm Mexican and I could care less about hispanic heritage month.

You could introduce him as how everyone views him, and the typical 'lying down on a sofa, tell me your problems' type thing. The oedipus and elektra (boys fall in love with their mums, girls with their dads) is also funny to talk about. His work on the unconscious mind and defense mechanisms are still very much relevant today too. The unconscious mind has been likened to that of an iceberg, termed iceberg analogy, as only a bit of the mind is visible/above sea level/conscious such as thoughts and feelings, and the rest is unconscious/below sea level such as wants, passions, fears, traumas etc. Defense mechanisms are used to protect oneself from trauma and anxiety. e.g. repression (pushing the memory into the unconsious).

I suggest you depend on your intelligence to gain your balance and knowledge, not us yahoos on yahoo.<br>  but if you want to hear my story....I am turning 50 this year.  I embrace the depth of my feelings Instead of "knowing what my boundaries "are I in realize they are endless.  I listen to my mind when it gives me that little "tickle" I call it.  For example: I was driving past a girl who was standing up against a building.  I didn't know her and it wasn't that cold.  But that "tickle" in my brain gave me a message to   pulled over, I didn't say anything to her, just took off my coat and handed it to her.  When our eyes met it was deep.

I think you might have experienced a contentness about how your life is now, and appreciating it and your worries have been cleared.

I'm very methodical about keeping things on a tight schedule, so the children (grandkids) have their meals on time, diaper changes on time, baths on time, and get to bed on time.  That means that I have to make every effort to keep things organized and running smoothly.  In the back of my mind, I work on finances, and plans for tomorrow...whether there's appointments to get to, shopping to do, or whatever.  But my basic priority is the kids.

12VQ4ETcaa	It sounds like you get overwhelmed when you are angry.  That can't be fun.  Anger management issues are pretty hard to deal with.<br>  <br>  The thing is that when you demonstrate you are upset, it scares people.  People will get upset by raised voices, angry facial expressions, gestures, and rough language, much less throwing or striking things.  They can't tell what you'll do next and they don't feel safe.  Employers and schools also feel like they have a legal liability if they allow you to do things like this on their premises.<br>  <br>  Now, if you did things like this, but you also hurt people on purpose and thought it was a good idea, well, you'd be a loser.  Since you realize you are causing problems for yourself, you're on the right track.|`|jzazkrAQaa	You're not a looser, but perhaps you need some help with your anger.

It seems like you cannot handle other peoples criticism, which is bad because your going to have to deal with that  your whole life! especially more when  your out of high school. It may sound like a ridiculous suggestion but really it will work. Other than that get involved with your religion and see if your faith can help control your anger. Your not a loser, you just have a hard time coping with any type of criticism directed towards you. You need to learn to let things go. Once you learn how to do  that you will  find yourself being happier and more relaxed.

iJzlRCkOaa	You may want to consider the book and movie "A Clockwork Orange."  But in complete honesty, if you're any younger than 16 or are disturbed easily, do NOT expose yourself to it.  It's easily one of the most disturbing books/films in existence.  But you can still use the idea behind it.  It's a story in which teenagers pretty much run the world.  But they do so with violence.  They beat up, rape and murder people all the time.  And ironically, the leader's favorite musician is Beethoven.  Beethovan is pretty much all he listens to, actually.  This idea demonstrates that it is not the specific type of music that generates violence.  Rather, it is the mental state of the individual listening to the music along with the surrounding society.  But bear in mind that this is a fictional work.  It cannot be used as fact, but can put a very interesting perspective on things.|`|trMsK86jaa	Not sure, i always found that when people play music often, and loudly, they turn into assholes.<br>  <br>  Probably because they see their music as a state of defiance or some bs like that and don't realise they're driving everyone nuts.<br>  <br>  That kind of kid is the kind of kid that people affectionately term "Special".

Join a book club at your local library, or take an art class at a community college. Channel all of your negative energy into something positive.

In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[70]<br>  <br>  Nigeria has one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and has the theoretical capacity to produce about 3.2 million barrels <br>  <br>  Some countries, notably Botswana and South Africa, have experienced economic success. The latter has a wealth of natural resources, being the world's leading producer of both gold and diamonds, and having a well-established legal system. South Africa also has access to financial capital, numerous markets, skilled labor, and first world infrastructure in much of the country and has one of the major stock exchanges of the continent, the JSE Securities Exchange.<br>  <br>  Over a quarter of the budget of Botswana (also a major diamond producer) currently goes toward improving the infrastructure of Gaborone, the nation's capital and largest city. Other African countries are making comparable progress, such as Ghana, Cameroon and Egypt.|`|9F6hdc3waa	i'm guessing yes . . . they have a lot of resources dat they import abroad

T3d4iXGFaa	Little one I agree, I think people like negativity because it makes them feel better about themselves that they are living a better life than so and so.  <br>  <br>  Stay clear of the anger dear and help your fellow man. MEOW!!|`|etdZZZLhaa	That's because people are afraid. Afraid of a lot of things in the world.<br>  <br>  It's like, when people see that others are more miserable than them, it makes them feel better because they're better than other people. With this attitude, the fear in them lessens.<br>  <br>  When people complain, even about good things, it might be that they're bragging or that they're fishing for information IF someone is better than them. And if they get answers, they complain more because they feel miserable, or envious or whatever.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to digest the negativity that's happening or the negativity that your witnessing in your everyday life, then DON'T focus on the things that these people say but focus on their character or on what they're implying to say.<br>  <br>  And you know what? you'll find yourself laughin inside on how shallow people can be..haha|`|w4V0jOpbaa	I quickly avoid people who constantly gripe.

gHxmYuGmaa	Being an amateur and recreational athlete for much of my life, I found this question of interest.<br>  <br>  It is not typical at the professional, Olympic or Collegiate levels for women to serve as referees if it is a male sport and vice-versa.  There is no rule that states that mandates this either way.  However, as a referee of said sport that would require you to run, skate, & move along with the play in order to make calls you would obviously need to be able to keep up.<br>  <br>  The abusive behavior towards officials that you mention should not be tolerated period.  If this is taking place it is a failure of the league governing organization and players union.  <br>  <br>  In some sports, the team designates captains and alternates and the rules are very strict that they are the only ones that are allowed to speak to an official when questioning a call.  Even then, you have to do so with respect or risk a misconduct call.<br>  <br>  I think in European Professional Soccer the abuse of the officials is somewhat equivalent to the fans enjoyment of fighting in Hockey, which is considered to be a strategic and even important part of the game.<br>  <br>  Your third point: "Can I also assume that you would want female players next mixing with men?"<br>  At the pro level this would be rare that you'd have a woman athlete that could compete at pro mens level, but there are some that already do.  Usually this is considered a novelty or publicity stunt.<br>  <br>  And hello but, a player sticking his studs into another player is not right whether or not it's a woman or man.|`|JqqyDd5Uaa	When the NBA added female refs, they also added a zero tolerance policy for back talking the referees.  Coincidence?  Doubtful.|`|AA10712251	forget the verbal abuse. What will they do when one of those 200 + lb men running full speed runs into one of the ladies on the field?|`|ftbIWNydaa	Its a great idea.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	What's wrong with that?  Don't the NBA players shout at the women refs?  You are assuming that women can't take care of themselves.  I am more than capable of holding my own in the presence of any man.    And honestly, I'd love to be an NFL ref.  Just to be in the middle of all those fine, strong, young men.  Whoo!  <br>  <br>  I got the ball!  I got the ball!!  Chase me, chase me!<br>  <br>  EDIT - I played football (American) in elementary school.  I wasn't too bad either.  I think if a woman can take care of herself on the field and can take those hits "like a man" then no, I wouldn't have a problem with that and I wouldn't mind my children seeing that either.  To me it would send a positive message instead of the negative one that you are suggesting.|`|BMIW36XFaa	Why not?  Woman can handle being yelled at in other sports, why not one that's a "male dominated sport"?<br>  <br>  Are you afraid they'll hurt our virgin ears?  Have you heard the way some women talk these days...?  They probably can cuss louder and more colorful than half the men on both teams!<br>  <br>  I don't agree with that language, I think it's a sign of lack of vocabulary skills...no matter what gender is using that type of language.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"Do you agree with allowing women to partake in a male dominated game?"<br>  <br>  If the game isn't based on upper-body strength, why not?<br>  <br>  "Do you think it would be appropriate to have male players berate a female official?"<br>  <br>  Of course.  She's an official first, woman second.  Gender has nothing to do with it.  Believe it or not, women can handle profanity.<br>  <br>  "Would it be wise to show children images of men shouting at a female referee?"<br>  <br>  Again, why not?  Men are allowed to yell at women and women are allowed to yell at men.  There's nothing wrong with that.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	The mentality might be that the players would never yell at a woman. I've heard statements to that effect in different fields.

They can usually talk very informed about a lot of issues.

I just feel sexy in them.|`|xiYjI33Qaa	An Italian urologist and self-professed lover of the sexy shoe set out to prove that high heels were not as bad for women's health as some suggest.<br>  <br>  The shoe has been linked to a range of problems - from corns to schizophrenia.<br>  <br>  But in a letter to European Urology, Dr Maria Cerruto said her research showed it was time to stand up for the heel.<br>  <br>  She said her study of 66 women under 50 found that those who held their foot at a 15 degree angle to the ground - the equivalent of a two inch heel - had as good posture as those who wore flat shoes, and crucially showed less electrical activity in their pelvic muscles.<br>  <br>  This suggested the muscles were at an optimum position, which could well improve their strength and ability to contract.<br>  <br>  The pelvic floor muscles are an essential component of the female body. As well as assisting sexual performance and satisfaction, they provide vital support to the pelvic organs, which include the bladder, bowels and uterus.<br>  <br>  But they often weaken after pregnancy and childbirth, and as the woman gets older. There are exercises to strengthen them, but Dr Cerruto hopes her findings may eliminate the need for these.<br>  <br>  "Women often have difficulty in carrying out the right exercises for the pelvic zone and wearing heels could be the solution," she said.<br>  <br>  "Like many women, I like high-heeled shoes," she added. "It's good to know they have potential health benefits."<br>  <br>  Gill Brook, a women's health physiotherapist in Bradford, stressed the findings did not suggest that stilettos were a good thing for those keen on improving their pelvic floor function.<br>  <br>  "But for women who like a slightly higher heel, these are reassuring findings - although we haven't yet done away with the need for regular exercises to maintain what is such an important part of the female body."|`|Rvs1mVqwaa	They can be pretty uncomfortable, but they help make the leg look longer and therefore slimmer....and they help the calf muscles look more toned.

Face it, life is not great for everyone.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Some people are more prone to depression than others. It's to do with the production of chemicals in our brains; some people produce an excess of 'sad' hormones. That's why two people can go through the same experience, but react very differently. Two women can have a miscarriage; one can become severely depressed, the other can find a way to deal with it then try for another baby. <br>  <br>  Other people are beset by problems, and that's the only reason they're unhappy. When the problems get ressolved, they're happy. That's like i am.|`|A9NBtUy6aa	Yes. <br>  I am a very positive person, and nearly always happy and smiling- when i am not its usually because i am very stressed and tired and it's making me ill, i've got 5 essays due, choir rehearsals and the like, and no time to do what i need to do...and then maybe ill be sad until i step outside and i see the sun, and hear the birds, and remember that I'm seeing a friend tonight.<br>  <br>  But then, there are some people that are so involved in their lives, they fail to see the beauty of nature and feel grateful for what they have got...I know people who stress and cry because of a piece of homework...who cannot smile ever, because there is no reason to smile. They are constantly finding something new to be unhappy about... <br>  <br>  I think people as a whole should learn to be grateful for what they have. If they don't have a cold, be grateful they can breathe through their noses... if they don't have a boyfriend, be grateful they're free to look, and no one is telling them what to do... if they broke a nail at the party last night... be grateful they had a good party, and be grateful they didn't break a neck... If they take a day off ill, be grateful its not a year off with cancer.

You cannot call it to will. It is something that comes to you almost instantly. It would be wise to always follow your gut instinct. When you feel it, it will stay with you and nag you until you do what is right. In my opinion, the gut feeling is like the Holy Spirit coming in to save you or your family from some terrible tragedy. Remember that we were born with the ability to only use part of our brain. This gut instinct could be something from the areas we don't readily use.<br>  <br>  At least it seem that you know you have a gut instinct. That is good. Listen to it. Save you and your loved ones from what could be something very bad.<br>  <br>  And know this too. When you are driving at night, on your way home, and you go one or two specific routes every time, be prepared for your instinct to kick in and tell you to take a different route.

If you are still waiting on an answer, you need to stand back and "let her choose", and this may be causing you anxiety. In this context, I don't think your friend being in the dream really means anything to do with his future intentions, but is appearing here as a symbol for single life, while you of course stand as a symbol for married life.  Best wishes...|`|zGkqGZzYaa	Sigmund Freud made a study of  interpreting dreams.<br>  From what I remember of the classes I took it tells one of a couple of things.<br>  1st There may be some insecurity on your part, in that you may be a little worried about her truthfulness, and that she may be living a double life that you may not be aware of.<br>  2nd You don't mention if she accepted or rejected your proposal.<br>  There can be underlying message in the fact that you may be worried about her sincerity about 2 things, the engagement, and if in fact if she is truthful.<br>  This is not to say that she is or isn't but, we as humans have the ability of premonition, so if things are not right we sense it.|`|nrTDOs6aaa	Nope dreams dont have meanings.<br>  They are collections of thoughts being process by the brain at night.<br>  Its most likely that deep down, you are worried you might lose this girl (Orkideh?) in your waking life, and your brain has just put together images and a story of you losing her to your best friend.

Once I talked to him about it, I never had another dream like that. Maybe you should try talking to her about what you dreamed about. <br>  <br>  Also, yes dreams can have meaning. You just have to know what your looking for in your dream. Most of the time your dreaming about thoughts that have went through your head during the day. I hope that helps.

429093af889ade4be8f7e7ce8b917485aa	Hi !<br>  I'm glad you discovered and got "in touch" with what really matters in life, life itself, and people.  Its too bad our society is generally distant, and cold (I'm not talking about weather or climate, I'm talking about human society and our English-based "western culture").  In other cultures, they are more warm in interpersonal-relations like its no big deal, but unfortunately our society generally favours the cool and cold-hearted over the warm and friendly.  There are health and social benefits to hugging regardless if our society does not consider it commonplace.  I think we all need to loosen up a bit, and be like those huggers you talk about. <br>  <br>  If you really want to know WHY we need hugs etc, I strongly recommend a certain book written about that, written by <br>  Ashley Montagu -- the book is called "Touching"  <br>  Ashley Montagu was an Anthropologist and Educator who specialized in human bio-social evolution.  Its very interesting and informative reading.  <br>  <br>  I'd also recommend listening to taped presentations by Leo Buscaglia on the various facets on the topic of "Love".  Go visit your library or book store or book selling website (maybe even ebay) and get full copies, and you might find some preliminary samples of Leo on youtube too.  For health and sanity's sake, honour life and people and enjoy a hug now and then.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Everyone needs intimacy.  Everyone.

nNbE4WwVaa	Dear person,<br>  <br>  I'm taking this statement as saying that you feel like committing suicide, an action which God does not condone. I say this to you in hopes that you are a believer and can attest to the grace of God and love of Christ. <br>  If you are not, then here's another angle that may suit you better. Suicide is a very selfish act. It is an act that shows that you did not trust the people around you enough to help you or intervene, that you could not seek out the help you needed to make life better. But, I want you to know that life does get better. I know that times get hard and you feel like just giving up, but once you give this up, there is no coming back. There is so much that you can contribute to this world. You have so much to give to our community of humanity. Do not ever doubt your worth as a human being. You can make it through this sadness that you have. You have the inner strength to make it. You are seeking help from Yahoo! but I feel as though you should be seeking counsel from those who love you and care about you because even when you think no cares, there is ALWAYS someone who does. <br>  <br>  I will pray for you and hope that you do not take your life tonight. I will hope that you see the great contribution that you can make in this world and recognize the ones that you have alreadyy made in this world. By serving as a veteran, you have showed your dedication to your country and your belief of justice and freedom. <br>  <br>  There is nothing more that I can say if you have already made up your mind, but I pray that you realize that your life is so very valuable and that you should give yourself the time to really appreciate it. <br>  <br>  Please do call:<br>  1-800-SUICIDE     1-800-273-TALK<br>  1-800-784-2433   1-800-273-8255|`|K2AXqpMJaa	Please don't hurt yourself.|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	what does snuffing mean?

AA10835554	There are low level lucid dreams and high level lucid dreams. In the lower levels you can't think clearly and so your decisions in the dream world are that of a drunken person. To reach a higher level of dream clarity you might try the sleep back to bed method. Most dreams start after about 5 or 6 hours of sleep when you enter REM. If you will wake up at that time, stay awake as long as you can, at least an hour, and then return to bed, you'll then be more clear minded or "lucid" in the dream world. <br>  <br>  This is why everyone isn't lucid in every dream, because we are too drunk to notice. The sleep back to bed method is designed to make the dream world like your real world, and so you can then realize you are dreaming because you have clear and logical thought patterns. Using this method you will probably find yourself getting out of bed in the dream and going about your normal day, until something really strange happens and then you can notice you're still in bed dreaming.<br>  <br>  Dreams do reflect how you feel during the day, or what you watch on tv. You may have a deep fear of being raped like allot of woman do, so if you could learn a method to help you deal with those thoughts during the day, that would be a huge help to you.<br>  <br>  So don't think you wanted to be raped just because you did something in the dream. We all do illogical things in low level dreams. Once I realized I was dreaming and flew through the air yelling "Flying Pizza Man!" ha I have no idea why I said that, but I do like pizza :)|`|AA12360662	The dream you have about deciding to stay and surrender may reflect some helplessness in you.<br>  <br>  Projecting be raped by guys or being hurt by them signifies lack of control in you.  You may be in lucid dreaming, however, that lucid dreaming reflects heavy helplessness in you.<br>  <br>  In translation, you may be having some conflict in your life.  Realizing in dream stage that you are dreaming and not willing to wake yourself up could imply that you are feeling vulnerable in some aspect of your life. <br>  <br>  That is a sign of defeat and helplessness.  In other words, you are looking for ways to escape your unhappiness in reality.  So, even though you know it is a dream, and you were willing to stay, that also suggests that there is some attention seeking in you.  Projecting being raped in this case may reflect some attention seeking in you.<br>  <br>  Of course, dreamer knows about her/his dream, you probably know better than anyone else.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	To dream of a parking lot means: Side tracked. Off the beaten path. Non conformity.<br>  Alone in a dream means: Nothing lasts forever. Learn to appreciate what you have. Perhaps you need to let go of something. You may be feeling that something is missing from your life. Fear of losing control.<br>  Seeing a bunch of guys means: Your masculine self, the part of your personality that is assertive, takes action and makes decisions.<br>  Car means: Shows how you are traveling through life or through a particular situation. A speeding car is a good indication you need to slow down and take it easy in waking life.<br>  Not hiding from them indicates that you are not avoiding any issues or afraid of confrontation.<br>  Running for a short time means that your probably avoiding something or someone in your waking life.<br>  Part of your personality you are unfamiliar with. Time to become familiar with this aspect of yourself.<br>  Hope that helped, happy dreaming :)|`|8c4b3eb4750ebdad6b8f1012977f2f9baa	Maybe you feel a subconscious need to do something unpleasant you have been avoiding?

tRAHfYEbaa	Did it feel like your body was paralized? could you talk or move. There are also O.B.E 's ( out of body experiences) ( spirit leaves or meats up in another place). I have had many now; but the X won't dare confirm it, cause then it will nto be able to label me anymore; therefore admitting I am right. Nut I asked my best friend yesterday about the ones he did have and he did confirm it with the girl he met up with, so I know it is real...By the way; the body also feels tingly and you are only slightly asleep...Look up OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES in a search engine, they say it is immagination but don't explain how the spirit got the right information...So they pretty well think they can explain out GOD and the spirit, but just can't do it honestly...

AA10277958	i'm not saying you have this but it could be Trichotillomania. Trichotillomania is a type of mental illness in which people have an irresistible urge to pull out their hair, whether it's from their scalp, their eyebrows or other areas of their body. Hair pulling from the scalp often leaves them with patchy bald spots on their head, which they may go to great lengths to disguise. My friend has it and she just goes to a docter and stuff it's not like she's crazy out of her mind.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Sounds like trichotillomania. It's not a habit, it's an impulse control disorder (not OCD like many people will tell you). If you're not noticing you're doing it, you need to see a doctor in order to help you stop! You will need to identify triggers as well as come up with ways to prevent yourself from pulling. I was on antianxiety meds and met weekly with a therapist and bi-weekly with a psychologist. I learned behavioural techniques to stop myself from pulling as well as determining why I was pulling in the first place.|`|HA3wlq2Taa	you need to ask yourself how this makes you feel? why do you do it?<br>  it seems to be a symptom of something, not the problem itself.|`|H4dswqRlaa	Shave everywhere.|`|AA12111193	you need to go to a doctor <br>  there was an episode on true life about a girl who used to do what u do it was really bad she pulled her hair out everywhere there was hair on her body

They only love women & homosexual men.  Many of them are lesbians, remember.<br>  Male feminists are either homosexual, deluded, or deliberately seeking female approval.  Such men can take my word for it: it won't get you anywhere.  <br>  Feminists love people who watch porn?  I've not seen any data to support this but since feminists are always stupid, I wouldn't be surprised if it were true.  In my experience they always think that a woman in porn is 'strong', 'liberated', freed from the chains of male oppression, and all that crap; they never see that it dehumanizes all involved, or that it's the epitome of exploitation.<br>  Your third question doesn't make sense.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Why shouldn't feminists love some people-seems like a pretty basic thing to do.

ibMK6nPeaa	No my memory is very reliable. Especially the long term one.<br>  mfG gw38|`|agpCn6Kaaa	Sure is....when you write things down, they stay the way they were written.  Your memory is fallible and can be easily altered (even when you don't intend to), also memory can't be trusted to hold onto the facts forever...we forget over time.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Well, it depends on who is doing the writing. When we write things out at the time of events, we may think that we're getting all the facts, but we're only putting them down from our own perspective. Emotions are involved and people often think things may have been said or done that were not. So if you remember the event later, after all the facts came out then your memory would be more reliable than the pencil. However if an objective third party wrote it down or you rewrote it after you have learned all the facts (and can correct any mistakes) that is going to be more reliable than your memory years later because over time we forget details of what happened as new memories are added.|`|c1qLIB4Eaa	Dear Tirofijo,<br>  <br>  A Big Yes. You are very much correct. But why you want the answer to be vatted by others. Anyway let me explain:<br>  <br>  1. The main reason of putting everything down the paper is to releasing stress from the MIND. Whenever a task, situation, any call, or anything is needed to be done we actually engage our RAM memory for keeping remember and alarming. Rather as and when we write it down we release that much amount of memory and thus our speed increase.<br>  <br>  2. Some people are always thinking and thinking that if they should not forget anything because they believe in their memory and they seldom forgets the goals. <br>  <br>  3. If the memory gets free we may think the unthinkable part of the life which is still need a deep thought. Like a action plan to the unfulfilled goals in LIFE.<br>  <br>  4. After using the pencil, FOCUS and CONCENTRATION can be increased to an extent to reach the dreams ASAP.<br>  <br>  I hope that others will also take advantage of yours such a nice question. <br>  <br>  Hope it is too much and this much is okay.<br>  <br>  All the best and God Bless.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  www.dwincorporation.com|`|rMUHL62uaa	depends how long the memory and how short the pencil...|`|u8slDDkLaa	uh i dont WHAT ???<br>  :^Y

You might want to explain a dream maybe a little more clearly. People could have dreams about someone they like. They could have a dream about them, because it could show that you still want them. Dreams sometimes can relate to your mood or what's happening in your life. I used to be mad at this girl, because she was being rude lately, and I used to have dreams about me getting mad at her. I had dreams of me getting mad at her like 3 times in a row on three different nights., and when I told her she apologized and the same night I had a dream of her and I being best friends lolz!|`|n6deQ4n4aa	why do i keep thinking about a really hot girl i got with once and never saw again? its a guess thats just what women do to you|`|Ug7Om1qyaa	because you think about her a lot.<br>  when you are sleep your unconscious<br>  mind does the same through dreams.

AA12360662	being pushed = being taken control<br>  in a wheel chair = low self esteem<br>  other people and dogs falling = social pressure<br>  <br>  You don't need to be disabled to project that you are in a wheel chair.  In your subconscious mind, that may be a symbol of low self confidence in life.  Being pushed in this case may reflect losing control in you.  You may be feeling some peer pressure in life.  That is why you project other people and dogs (as in friendship) falling.  <br>  <br>  This unknown pusher may be some force or something or someone that has said something to you to hurt in your reality.  Or this could signifies something you can't take control over.  Whatever it is examine your life, you will know exactly what it is.|`|YvjPePdIaa	To see or dream that you are in a wheelchair, suggests that you need to stand on your own two feet and stop depending on others.  Perhaps you are feeling helpless. Alternatively, it indicates that you are literally letting others push you around.

They may be afraid to ask you directly and have been dropping hints which your unconscious may have picked up on.
WQlNNHuXaa	This type of thing is not a new phenomenon, disgusting as it is.The Expressionist painters of the 1930's such as Otto Dix, often created images of lustmorde or sex death. It was a rabid misogyny then and it is a rabid misogyny now. It is highly unethical and sick!|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	That is not misogyny.<br>  <br>  It's perversion.|`|f0a3d59262cb942ba6463d8c525a1cd8aa	You have huge gaps in your general knowledge which must be filled before you can begin to understand the answers to these questions.<br>  You first need to understand how political systems work, specifically democracy and the laws of your own land. Then you would know where the line is drawn between what is illegal and what is not, and who draws the lines.<br>  In short, in a democracy, 'the people' (who vote) draw the lines. Also it is 'the people' who decide what should be illegal and what should be allowed. <br>  Now examine your question: looking at something is not illegal; nor is thinking about something.  Whether talking about something should be illegal has come under much debate - the free speech question.  Whether depicting a thing should be illegal has equally come under scrutiny - the censorship debate.<br>  One immediate and obvious line - and one which eluded you - is the distinction between that which is illegal and that which is offensive.<br>  Sex with children has been ruled illegal: therefore child pornography must also be illegal.  Race, sexual identity, and gender are immaterial to this and other such questions.  A child - black, white, Hispanic, Caucasian, homosexual or heterosexual, et al. - is still a child (according to the age of majority (which varies by country & possibly even by State in America. The age of majority is, in a democracy, determined by 'the people' again)).  The offensiveness of child pornography is also immaterial (clearly some people are not offended by it but that doesn't alter the law).<br>  <br>  Enjoying a thing is never illegal no matter how offensive one may find it.  The option to seek to get something banned is always open to a member of a democracy.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	It would be no more offensive that if we took any feminist literature and swapped references of "men" for "blacks" (or "jews", etc.) and "women" for "nazis".<br>  <br>  You're using the very same logic MRA's have been trying to impress upon you for the last few decades.<br>  <br>  It's incredible that the only time you can follow this logic - is to suite yourself - but utterly refuse to acknowledge this logic when men address it in reference to feminist hate speech directed at men.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I can't imagine any feminist having the 'strength' to say "all blacks are rapists" or for Harriet Harman to write a book in which she states "black fathers cannot be seen as remotely advantageous to th family unit"... because that would be racist. But it's fine slamming men, isn't it.
agpCn6Kaaa	You can't blame yourself for your dad's drinking.  This is a choice he's making on his own...he's an adult and free to make his own decisions.  If he's getting drunk every day, then he may be an alcoholic.  If you feel bad about giving him a hard time, well then maybe you might try to not do that so much anymore...you are free to choose how you want to behave, too.  Anyway, if he has a drinking problem, then there is nothing you can do, he has to want help and seek out help and make those changes for himself.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	There are two types of alcoholics.  Functional and non-functional.  Functional alcoholics can go to work, raise their kids but be a drunk.<br>  Non-functioning, of course, are the ones that can't hold a job, is abusinve and usually are living on the streets.<br>  <br>  Your father, just because he drinks, doesn't have to be an alcoholic.  It usually runs in families.  Anyone else in your family a drunk?<br>  <br>  I don't know why you think your father has aproblem but you can't confront him unless he starts being abusive, loses his job because of his drinking. etc.|`|AA11952133	YOU are NOT the cause of your father's drinking.  We all have to take responsibility for our actions, even drinkers.  You are just a normal kid so relax.  <br>  There is something that you can do though, just like they have AA, they have Narcotics Anonymous for people with loved ones that are alcoholics.  These people have the same issues you have and will be better suited to understand your pain.  Check them out online or your local newspaper.  You can probably find a meeting close to your home.

Much like love, we know it exists, and can feel it in our hearts. When people realize the existance of God, and most importantly think of God in all their daily acitivites, its brings a natural control to society.

I don't really look at the weight that much but, I'm unique in this. Your eyes are the things that need help! Cool thing is that makeup will fix the problem and maybe even a pair of glasses.

I don't like to get involved so much into deciding whats good in a person and what's not, both physically and mentally.

If you were a Christian, I would tell you which verses to look up in the Bible that could aid you in this area. However, I will say this, HONEY you are NOT fat. There are some people who may fit that criteria who would upset and even more offended that you choose to call yourself such. Stop letting people who aren't you tell you how to feel about yourself. That's something that you have to do. If you think that you are pretty, then you need to walk around believing it, and others will too. And if they don't, who cares? What they have to say shouldn't affect what you wake up and do every morning. Hold your head up and confront the fact that you are letting other people shape how you feel about yourself.|`|kW0OZknRaa	when we,re young we tend to really concentrate and put all our focus on outside appearance.

It is as vast as space. Beauty isn,t outside appearance, it is inner energy that we expose when we speak, act, and love. Everything on our outside is accessible to imperfection from zits to hurt feelings. What we have inside is truly our given to us to share with ones we love. Just as a mother or father thinks their babies are the most beautiful in the world, it comes from within not without. You should be thankful and happy with what your Creator has given you.

However, if you are deemed a threat you can be further detained.|`|XAKEMdisaa	I'm not sure exactly the laws in your state, but I do know that if you actually attempt suicide you will be forcefully put in. <br>  <br>  Changes in your emotional stability - it would depend on how unstable you became.

By definition, if you think you have low self esteem that means that you really think you are better than you perceive yourself to be.  So isn't that high self esteem?  Perhaps your perception is really correct and that you are no better than you think you are.|`|r8VvBxM6aa	I know it's not easy, but once you can block out everyone else's negativity you can focus on your own positivity.

At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|05d05342b340961643a18c3d866ab89baa	Sweetheart, I know you're beautiful because God made you and he don't make junk.

agpCn6Kaaa	Sounds like an intense fear.  My kids were like that when they were young, they walked in on their Dad watching this movie called "Killer Clowns from Outer Space" and it scared the daylights out of them!  It's okay, just avoid them when you can...you are aware of your fear, and it may even seem silly to you, but eventually you will be able to get over it.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	This definitely sounds like being more than a "bit scared". So yes, you probably do have coulrophobia.|`|rMUHL62uaa	i think you have coulrophobia. but since that isn't a real term in physiology you are extremely afraid of clowns.|`|kAceP1pzaa	You must not eat at McDonald's

Hope this helped somehow.
BMxNOJ39aa	The 2012 date is simply the end of the long count. The Mayan calendar has the Long count, Katun and Baktun cycles in it.<br>  <br>  "The length of the Long Count is exactly 1,872,000 days, or 5,125.37 years. We know this to be so because we know the lengths of the fundamental units of Mayan time. ...the katun is a Mayan time period of 7,200 days. A katun of 7,200 days was considered a major time period, a generation marker of sorts. We know that there are 260 katuns in the Long Count,which, when multiplied by the number of days in a katun, gives us 1,872,000 days again. We also know about the baktun, a period of 144,000 days, and we know that there are 13 baktuns in the Long Count."<br>  <a href="http://www.onereed.com/articles/mayan_calendar_explained.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.onereed.com/articles/mayan_ca...</a><br>  <br>  Where we have New Years and recently the mellinium, the Mayan had their Long Count, Katun and Bakun.

If the Mayans were still doing their calendar thing, it would simply reset, much like the 20th century became the 21st.  I have no idea why the woo-woo set has attached themselves to 2012, but it's really not much different from our cycles of millenia.|`|PcozPpA4aa	the mayans never said the world would end. just some thing that hollywood made up.

DoHaUEziaa	I think it's more difficult to communicate via the internet. Words can be misconstrued without facial input and body language. For instance, you might be joking about something and it may be taken the wrong way out of context. I don't feel like I'm hiding but then, I'm not going out of my way to piss people off either. I have unintentionally ticked someone off. I felt they were being WAY too sensitive and I apologized. Just goes to show. No matter what you do you'll never please everyone so you might as well please yourself. Ok, now I'm hiding.....and I'm going to go please myself. lmao.|`|WYuK1OUnaa	Mmm quite a thought provoking question..<br>  On reflection I have just decided I do not really consider to be 'talking' via computer...communicating yes but not talking.<br>  <br>  I like to think I am just myself in either situation but I suppose there is the annonimity factor to consider!<br>  <br>  I suppose some people think they can be more critical/flamboyant when they would not do that in a personal setting? Me I try to just be me!|`|SSlz82Djaa	Yes. I am always just me, whether on the internet or in person. I would hate people to think badly of me or what I say on my computer just as I would in life.

OUbNSXjJaa	Jealousy arises when the other man is having more material or mental possessions more than us.<br>  <br>  Hatred is a dislike for no reason. It comes from hate.|`|AUargJTaaa	I guess jealousy is when you want or desire something that that particular person has, yet you hate them for having it. When you think about you having that trait and NOT them, then you feel happy.<br>  <br>  Hatred is when you dislike a person for some reason, and you do not want to have this trait.<br>  <br>  I hate it when I genuinely dislike a person and tell someone, and then they tell me, "Oh, you're just jealous". NO, NO I AM NOT. Here's a good example of hatred: I hate people who think they can pinpoint my thoughts. lol|`|2b1a007863fa10f21afc21a0bfc10306aa	i have no idea its kind of a personal type of feeling its nothing that can be cmpared  i have jealousy but very little its common becuase u want to get on that persons level like im jeaslous of my bro and cousins they all went to college universitys and me imma fuckin sailor =( and umm hatred i hate no i dont hate just dislike its hard to find a diffrence|`|kjP8S7WIaa	jealousy is when you want to have something the other person has or be the other person. hatred is just hating their guts.! well my opinion..|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Jealousy=Want what they have.<br>  Hatred=Can't stand who they are.<br>  Btw 2 very bad qualities.
