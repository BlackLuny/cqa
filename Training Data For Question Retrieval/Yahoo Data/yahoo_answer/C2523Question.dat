20090202194005AAJwNsF	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	1996 Honda Accord automatic transmission lay-out?	1996 Honda Accord with automatic transmission      When I put my car into the drive position and press on the gas the car will not move.   Users of this portal suggested that the problem may be caused by a low level of fluid.   I found HEAVY leak below radiator, so one coolant line has a leak.      My question is:   Will the transmission work if I tow the car, fix a leak and change transmission fluid? Or it’s too late and transmission died already? Any similar experience?      Additional information:   I don’t know when leak began,  I use my car every day, yesterday  I stopped on red light and had a problem to move ahead on green. I drove ~1 mile with 3000 rpm and 10 mph to nearest parking space. I didn’t hear any noises before the car broke down.      If transmission works without a fluid will it work until it dies or will it just simply stop working (turn off) and remain in working condition?

That was when he said the vibration started.  He claims to have had the axles and the tires checked which came out fine.   What else could cause this?  It isn't as noticeable once you hit 50+ mph.  Also I should add that the steering wheel is a bit hard to turn at times.  I'm going to have it checked out in a few days but thought I would see if anyone had any ideas.

Every morning when I start the engine and drive, the speedometer and milage display completely turn off...    Then after 10-15 minutes of drive they come back on.... and this thing just happens in the morning when its cold.

Therefore I suspect that something happens to the sensor or possibly electronic device of my car in the morning when its cold.

In a fit of true genius I put a tank of E-85 into my non-flexfuel 2003 Honda Civic roughly 2-3 months ago.

If there is a reason to be concerned, is there a cost-efficient solution?  Thanks.

Car.com rates the hybrid at 20/21 MPG CTY/HWY and the other one at 12/19.  The hybrid invoices at $65,737, the other one is $56,975.  When driving mostly highway miles, it would take a REALLY long time to make back the extra money spent to get the hybrid version of it, plus the repair expenses on the hybrid would most likely cost much more.  Could somebody do the math and tell me how many miles you would have to drive to realize the gas savings?  I doubt you would meet that mileage in the lifetime of the vehicle.

Ive seen many countries which train stations have automatic ticket machines, which you just have to put ur wallet (with the ticket inside of course) on top of the scanner, and you can go through. In australia i still see machines where u have to put ur ticket in. I think that upgrading those would not be dat difficult, and it would save a lot of time, encourage ppl to buy weekly tickets. Being a student, I also find losing those tickets is a disaster as well. The upgrade improves everything. What do you think??

20090202214027AAgdOWi	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Truck not starting all the time, not even trying to?	Ok so it has been doing this for a couple weeks now, only every now and then. Its a 1991 S-10 blazer 4.3l. I think the motor isnt getting spark. I have no idea how to track it down though. Here is what it has been doing.      I left the bank drive though, and right as soon as I got to the stop sign the truck just dies, right before I stopped. It didnt bog down and die it just completely died. Then I went to start it and it fired back up and ran fine.   Then   Today I went to a person house to pick up valve covers, truck ran fine all the way there, after I got back in my truck and try to start it, it would not start at all. It wouldnt even try. I could smell fuel, but got NOT A THING from the motor. I played with a coil wire and still nothing.... I sat in my truck for about 5 minutes thinking about what it could be then I tried starting it again and it fired right up.   Then   I went to my girls house and hung out wit her for 2 hours, I went to go leave and started the truck....ran fine, put it in reverse and it moved 5 feet then just completely died out and wouldnt start. I tried cranking it for a while and nothing. I messed with the coil wire again looking inside to to see rust...and there is none. I am also thinking maybe the white wire to the coil (that I hooked a tach wire too), thinking that might be it but idk if that wire would cause these problems. Finaly after 10 minutes had passed, I tried starting it and it fired right up.   When I pulled in my driveway tonight the truck lost power completely for about .25 of a second then ran fine. Like it lost all spark then got it back.      I NEED HELP WITH THIS!!! How can I figure out what the problem is or try and track this down???
