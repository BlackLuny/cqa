You should be able to get fabric well within your budget in Australia, but I'm in the States, so I can't recommend a seller.  Here's a link to a page that might be able to help you, though:  <a href="http://www.designerstitch.com.au/fabric-shops/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerstitch.com.au/fabric-...</a><br>  <br>  The last bridesmaid dress I made was a combination of crepe-backed satin and (soft) velvet, and it was for an early spring wedding (equivalent to what your weather will be like in September).  Both fabrics were easy to work with, and I could recommend both fabrics.  If you're getting married in high summer, you may want to go with a lighter-weight dressy fabric.  A wedding I've attended with absolutely gorgeous bridesmaid dresses used a single jersey fabric for all the dresses, and each one of which was unique--but the designs were chosen by the guy who made the dresses, so they coordinated.  <br>  <br>  Here's my suggestion:  Select two or three patterns with changeable elements (see suggestions in the links below) that coordinate with each other.  Ask your bridesmaids to select the pattern and the elements that are most flattering to each individual--that way you don't end up with one who looks like Little BoPeep, one who looks like Jennifer Lopez, and four who look like Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada.   The patterns selected will pretty much dictate the type of fabric you'll need.  <br>  <br>  Also, if your mother and sister-in-law will be doing the cutting and sewing, you'll need less fabric overall than if you were cutting dress lengths and handing them out to multiple seamstresses.  Just a thought.|`|miowW3Muaa	The amount of fabric you will need depends on a number of factors. <br>  <br>  1. How wide is the fabric you want to buy? You many need more fabric if it is 115cm [45in] as opposed to 150cm [59in] or wider. You will have to work this out as you look at fabrics or decide before hand on a width and stick to it.<br>  2. How tall are the girls? This will dictate the length that you buy. If you are using a pattern the back will tell you how much to buy based on the girl's individual bust and waist measurements. If there is a discrepancy, always go for the bigger size measurement. A rule of thumb that has served me well but leads inevitably to a little too much fabric is take a measurement from ankle to shoulder, double it and that is the amount for that person, provided the fabric is wider than 115cm [45in]. <br>  3. What is the dress pattern? The more elaborate your pattern, the more fabric you will need.<br>  4. How wide will the bottom be? The wider it is, the more fabric you will need.<br>  5. Is there going to be a print? This has a great bearing on whether or not you can have printed fabric. You will have to match the design which can mean you have to buy up to double the amount f fabric.<br>  6. Are you using a prebought pattern from McCall’s or the like? It will have measurements for you to take on the back and you will get a length when you put them together.<br>  All of this has a part to play. Once you work out what the general dress pattern will be, go shopping and have a look around. <br>  <br>  The best type of fabric to use for a wedding is a satin or peachskin in my opinion but it depends entirely on your taste. You may want an airy wedding with cotton dresses; it’s your choice most of the time. However, I would consult with the dressmakers before buying something like prewash silk which tends to slide all over or any other such fabric eg. Voile, taffeta, etc as they are a b*&ch to work with if you have a time limit and many to do as a lot of tacking takes place. <br>  <br>  I live in South Africa so I cant help you with the last bit but I recommend large stores as they tend to be cheaper than boutique stores and they can order bolts of fabric for you, usually at a cheaper price of you take the whole roll. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, congratulations on the wedding and I hope it is blessed. <br>  Let me know if you have more questions...

52UlKHKqaa	To get Heatran on Pokemon Pearl (and Pokemon Diamond), you first have to gain access to the Battle Zone (The Large Northern Island on the map)<br>  <br>  To gain access to the Battle Zone you have to go to Snowpoint Mountain after you win the game and talk to the person in front of the boat.<br>  <br>  After arriving at Fight Area (Battle Zone's main port) you have to around the island to reach Stark Mountain, at the very north of the island, (you may need a Pokemon that knows surf to continue to the the top of the mountain) once you go all the way up the path and into the mountain you will meet up with Buck (I'm a bit unsure about this characters gender to be honest...). And you will venture together into the heart of the mountain.<br>  <br>  Once in the furthest cave Buck will take the magma stone there and go back to the Survival Zone where Buck Lives. Visit Buck at the Survival Zone and talk about the gem, Buck becomes uneasy as the volcano has started exhibiting strange signs and goes back to the mountain to put it back.<br>  <br>  Go back to the mountain and into the cave, once you get to the end Heatran will be waiting in place of the Magma Stone, be warned Heatran is powerful, take plenty of water and ground pokemon to take him on, and plenty of Dusk Balls.<br>  <br>  ~D

miowW3Muaa	That particular file is probably corrupted. It happened to me when I installed it. Just find the directory it is installed in, find someone else who's copy works, copy the file and insert it before reinstalling. The other thing that could happen is that either your computer or your graphics card can't handle the game. I have an old computer at home and a new gaming one and I regularly have that problem between them. Just make sure its not a hardware problem before playing with the software.

AA10726404	The link I've posted may help you understand here.<br>  <br>  Clearly you understand to some extent that the more people in the pot, the less powerful your hand is.  In this example if FIVE players ahead of you go all in, you are going to win just 28% of the time against random hands.<br>  <br>  But what are the odds that one of those all in players before you has an ace or king?  Pretty high unless they are morons.  At the very least you'd expect a pocket pair, which has you beat.<br>  <br>  However, if you are playing in a game where five people push all in before you, you are not playing real poker.  That's the kind of nonsense you might see on Facebook or MySpace poker for play money.<br>  <br>  In real poker it is rare to see three or more people getting all in on any given hand.<br>  <br>  I suggest you find some better quality games, because playing in crappy games like the one you just described will do nothing to improve your play.|`|440d4a17aefc552ef492e82a97f3ffefaa	laymens terms- If u really think your ace king is the best hnd play it everytime. If u lose you lose your stack when u win you get 5 of your stacks plus your origional you will lose a lot of money throwing your hand away.<br>  but with 5 all ins in front of you its doubtfull you have the best hand|`|LItIiiHKaa	Well if you're 95% sure you have the best hand in this situation then you're truly playing with idiots :)  You would figure with 5 all ins there would be at least one pocket pair out there for instance.<br>  <br>  Let's say though that your chance of winning were only 25%.  You will win 1 time out of 4 and win 5 stacks, and the other 3 times you'll lose your stack which adds up to 3 stacks.  So you net 2 stacks every 5 times you do this, which works out to an average expected gain of 2/5 of a stack each time you do this.  So it's a no brainer if you're right about your chance of winning.<br>  <br>  Folding the best hand is rarely a good move although there are exceptions but this isn't one of them ;)|`|YqHL52H5aa	The general strategy is to tighten up your opening hand range when going from 6max to full ring.  For example, playing only top 10% of hands versus top 20%.  This is all very dependent on the games you play... if at a home game like I believe you are referring to then calling with AK may be the right play if you think these guys are playing garbage.<br>  <br>  Conversely, you must first assess if you are willing to take the risk and slight edge to win all that money.  AK versus 5 players may win say 27% of the time for example, and even though you clearly have positive expectation it may be more worthwhile to wait until you expect to win at a higher percentage rate.  It is all related to your game dynamics my friend.|`|FWdv8A0eaa	You need to be very careful with multiple all ins, because as I say regularly in live games "Someone has something"<br>  <br>  The important thing to note here is that AK is not a made hand, that is, you need to hit a Ace or King or a straight to have a good hand. If many people go "all in" then there is a good chance that one or more of them have low or any pockets (a pair in the hand), if they have pockets it means that they actually have a better hand than you pre flop that is, you have no pair. <br>  <br>  The other factor is that at least one player will have an Ace with presumably a 10 or higher when there are this many callers, this means that you only have 2 Aces and 3 kings that you can hit. You need to be able to fold, as difficult as it is AK is not AA or KK. <br>  <br>  They call it Anna Kournikova (Looks good never wins).<br>  <br>  In general be careful to play in this situation (multiple all ins) unless you have AA KK QQ or JJ don't call. It really comes down to discipline. Yes there may be alot of money in the pot but other people are risking everything and most people don't go all in with AQ and this all you can really beat.<br>  <br>  Be mindful of how each player plays and if they over value their cards, look at calling but when the bet is smaller, you may think that this is tight play but it is smart play, as you will get AK again and be able to hit your Ace or King first before being pot committed.<br>  <br>  I have a poker blog where you can read some further advice if you want it. Link below.|`|eNHGiEvGaa	This sounds like maniac poker.  FIVE all-ins in front of you?  Well, as King Cobra pointed out, you clearly can't expect to have the best hand here unless your opponents pushed their chips in with their eyes closed.  At the same time, pot odds versus your actual chance of winning is the only consideration here.  Having less than a 50% chance of winning has nothing to do with it.  If you think you've got a hand that will win often enough, say 1/4 of the time, you should of course shove your chips in too.<br>  <br>  However, if there were any reasonable players involved in this pot, then I'd be pitching AK in the muck for sure.  Unless you're playing in a zoo or a mental institution, you're likely crushed.  Most of the time one of the players will have AA or KK, or else your in against a couple of lower pairs like JJ and QQ and the other players in the pot also hold at least an ace or a king or both, so that all your outs are dead.  I don't mind at all being all-in with AK versus QQ heads up with some dead money in the pot, but AK versus a field like QQ, JJ, AK, ATs, and KJs is really hellish... you're looking at two outs to maybe split the pot if no one else improves to trips or better!<br>  <br>  Another point, I'd just like to differ from the answer that refers to AK as "not a made hand."  Whether or not that's technically true, it's an overworn cliche.  The distinction of "made hand" versus "drawing hand" is of no real relevance when compared to the question "what are my chances of taking down the pot once the cards are out?"  We may, however, reach the same conclusion.  <br>  <br>  I'd say here that the presence of lower pairs alone is nothing to fear, but the probability of having your outs dead, and/or running into one of the two hands that can dominate you, are the real deciding factors.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Play slow
8hbm4uiPaa	In order to get any serious offers, you're going to have to provide a list of the 300 rares.  In order for them to be of any value, they must be in NM / MINT condition.  Any noticable play will reduce their value considerably.<br>  <br>  If you want to provide a list, I can give you an accurate assessment of their value.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Just saying that you have 300 rares doesn't make the value $500.00.  Some dealers sell rares at pre-releases 3 for $1.  You need to list what rares you have so that people can put the value on them.  Black Lotus, don't get only $500 for that, the value is $1,500 in mint condition, even played, it would go for $500, if it's in decent condition.  Any Moxes, Force of Will, Force Spike, Wrath of God, Foil Rares, would be worth decent or better cash.  Lich's Tomb, One with Nothing, and Un-rares are probably worth next to nothing.  Out of your 8000 cards, let people know how many are common and uncommon.  Look for good commons/uncommons to go with the rares.  Remand is a good uncommon, Swords to Plowshares, Oblivion Ring, Oblivion Stone, and such are good cards for people to go after and make great starter cards as well.  If that don't work, try to pile them into groups with a chase card/rare in each group and sell of the group for a decent amount of cash.  You might get $500 if you have good stuff, you might not, but the overall theme of the answers I'm seeing is that you have to let people know just which rares you have (and other good cards for that matter, and from which edition/set they would be in so we know if it's white border or black border cards, things like that actually make a difference).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|l6lh6fT8aa	I highly doubt you'll make anything close to $500. Unless the rares are chase Vintage rares (Force of Will, Time Vault, any of the Power Nine, Library of Alexandria, etc) or misprints (especially from Summer Magic), most old rares (especially those with wear) are worth very little. Commons and uncommons are similar, except there are no "chase" commons and uncommons (well, not any with any large value).

AA11606154	Ghost was canceled.  It got pushed back a lot, became dated, and Blizzard decided to suspend production in preperation for "Next gen consoles"  Now the X-Box 360 is out and no mention of continued development.

Canceling games it doesn't think will meet its quality standards.. ever seen a bad blizzard game?<br>  <br>  As for Starcraft 2, if you got the bonus ending for Warcraft 3 they had art for starcraft units was already done.  My guess is that they planned to do Starcraft 2 with the Warcraft 3 engine...<br>  <br>  Then world of Warcraft came out.. and Blizzard discovered they could print money.  WIth the mad profits of WoW Blizzard looks like they've thrown full efforts into expanding that money maker.  If they have any other projects going on they're keeping them deeply under wraps.<br>  <br>  But I'd be shocked if there wasn't some version of Starcraft 2 in some stage of development.|`|AA11180731	destroy him|`|AA12337204	i hope so
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Actually...there are no MMOGs based around WWII that I am aware of. <br>  <br>  That being said, The various Call of Duty games and possibly some of the Medal of Honour games have on-line play. They can be Deathmatch and non-deathmatch style servers, where you simply go in, and kill. They are not classifiable as MMOGs, because the largest maps can only support about 64 players. <br>  <br>  A WWII MMOG would be a game where there could literally be hundreds if not thousands of people playing simultaneously and able to communicate/interact playing the same maps simultaneously.<br>  <br>  However, it might actually be interesting were they to do so.<br>  Closest thing I can think of is the Star Wars MMOG that has be around, well, almost forever...it is a series of interlinked servers, where some servers are Rebel held, and some are Empire held. They actually had the Rebels capture an Empire server!<br>  <br>  Outside that, I have seen a few flight combat sims for WWII which were capable of on-line play. ILS(?) was one of them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dundJLgEaa	Call of duty is good,<br>  Red Alert 3 isn't ww2 but is along kinda the same<br>  command and conquer

XrGFZ2LJaa	What you've heard is unreliable rumours. Empire: Total War hasn't been delayed for 5 weeks because of "technical difficulties". In fact, it is still scheduled for release in very early March. If you want to confirm this or need any clarification, simply visit the official website of Creative Assembly and Sega: <br>  <a href="http://www.totalwar.com/empire/" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalwar.com/empire/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sega.com/games/?g=238" rel="nofollow">http://www.sega.com/games/?g=238</a><br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, I believe your NVIDIA GEFORCE 6800 GT will not work efficiently when running Empire: Total War. There will be massive lag, crashes and reboots, along with possible software conflictions. This model is ancient and an obsolete brand of video card that fails to meet the standards. Most current high-end games require at least a 6800 GT MINIMUM, so you can definitely be assured Empire: Total War will struggle.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	There there...<br>  <br>  Just play a game or two of Medevil II Total War in the meantime (as a faction you have never played) and you'll be okay.

TdROahUnaa	Heya<br>  <br>  Basically you run around the beginner area until there are not more quests and it sends you out into the big wide world. From then on you can go to a trainer ever 2 lvls or so to learn new spells. These trainers are found in all the major cities. These would be Undercity (UC) Orgrimmar  and Silvermoon cities if you are horde and Stormwind (SW) Darnassus and Ironforge (IF) if you are ally.<br>  <br>  From lvl 10 on you start getting skill points for your talent tree which you allecoate wherever you want depending on what you want to be. For mage your talent trees are frost fire and arcane I think. <br>  <br>  If you need help with quests you can go to www.wowhead.com<br>  It'll tell you about quests and items and npcs<br>  <br>  If you are above lvl 10 you can find yourself on the wow armory<br>  <br>  google wow armory and find your character which you can then check to look for gear upgrades.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun playing!!<br>  Ignore negative people there are some awesome people on wow!<br>  <br>  ^.^v|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Just keep questing. You can get a copy of Zygors guides if your really lost. Cartagraphor and questhelper are a must. Questhelper will help you manage all your quests and where to turn them in at. <br>  <br>  As for professions, start them now! It's harder to powerlevel them later.<br>  <br>  I would do either mining - skinning - herbalism <br>  pick one or two. there gathering skills so you do nothing but gather - sell<br>  Its a good way to get profit and if you start now you'll be able to get your mounts easy. <br>  <br>  Then if you want to get a crafting prof get one. I would suggest either enchanting or tailoring. Or you can use your gathering profession with your crafting profession, but you won;t make money for a long time. Crafting professions are money pits until your a high level. If you just want money do gathering, however, crafting professions make you more money at a high level if you do them right. <br>  <br>  As for leveling, just quest. WoW makes it easy for you. When you log out make sure your in an inn or a major city. (Orgrimmar, undercity, or silvermoon) because you gather rested xp which allows you to get 2x xp until it runs out. <br>  <br>  Look up some mage skill guides to help you out. Depending on what spec you want will depend on where you put your points. Just buy all the skills unless your saving money. Remember duel spec is coming out soon so don;t try to be a hybrid. Stick to one tree then you can duel spec next week.<br>  <br>  Addons make your life easier on WoW<br>  <br>  Get this <br>  <a href="http://www.wowmatrix.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowmatrix.com/</a><br>  It helps you manage your addons<br>  Then type in cartagraphor and questhelper <br>  Download and patch those. <br>  Put addons in your wow folder. <br>  When you log on in the bottom left there will be a addon botton, turn them on.<br>  Later on when you get more experienced you should get auctioneer. It tells you how much things sell for and whats a good profit or not so you wont get screwed over when you make money.<br>  <br>  Queshelper is a must for you right now though. It tells you where to go to complete quests, the fastest route to get there, and where to turn them in at, and what youve completed. <br>  <br>  Later on Omen is a good one too for later on. It helps you determine how much aggro your getting so later you can learn which spells to use when to not draw aggro<br>  <br>  Soon you can do RFC its a instance in oggrimar. Itll give you lots of xp and good gear.

Apparently this is a bit of a common problem, i looked it up around the internet on gaming forums (if ever you have another problem search in gaming forums, you won't be the only person affected by this problem). It seems that while US PS3 is region free the games you have may be encoded in a different way, which might explain why some and not all are working. <br>  <br>  try these websites and any links that they mention as there doesn't seem to be one definite solution to the problem<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/archive/index.php/t-2055285712.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/archive/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gtagaming.com/forums/showthread.php?t=105786" rel="nofollow">http://www.gtagaming.com/forums/showthre...</a><br>  <br>  it can get confsing and technical ( especially for me) some of them say you may have to purchase a hdtv (because your games don't work in standard definition), others say that if you have a hdtv and it still doesn't work a hdmi cable maybe needed OR: you might just need to buy a canadian version and see if that works but i'd advise you to explore all options buying any puchase is made because it could end up a bit costly, good luck|`|MDf0BoiNaa	while the ps3 is technically region free, not all games are. the resolution of a ntsc tv (and therefore, its games) is 480p, and the resolution of a PAL tv is 576p, and games made for one video output cant display on the other one. <br>  <br>  so the problem is not with your playstation not being able to play those games, its just an incompatible resolution, and thus, it wont display.<br>  <br>  the solution, however, is very simple, albeit expensive. while there exists a difference between the resolution standards of pal and ntsc video, that only exists in the realm of standard definition tvs. the resolution of hdtvs (720 or 1080) are a global standard. <br>  <br>  SO, as long as your ps3 knows that it's being displayed through an hdtv, itll play any game without any trouble.<br>  <br>  that said, it may be possible to try and change the A/V settings of the ps3 and try to fool it into thinking its hdtv, but it may be a whole different thing, and not work. worth a try though

AA11299045	You can't. Sorry, the soundtrack customization was only on the Xbox Vice City and PC version. You have to have a HDD to store the music you're using and (for the most part) PS2's don't. Even if you did get one the game wasn't programed to allow a customizable soundtrack. So unless you can hack it the only way you'll get a custom soundtrack is to turn the music volume all the way down and play your cd's while playing with the sound effects/voices on. Sorry.

159bcae5a808af6318c8d759a43b4073aa	Yes--I had it and it is quite usefull and now once i have gotten my 360 it has made the transtition mcuh easier Here is a description of a Pelican with Black and white on top<br>  <br>  Pelican Eclipse II Wireless 2.4:Every hardware company has been coming out with wireless controllers lately, if you don't have one yet, and are worried about reception quality. stop! Pelican's Eclipse 2 for the Microsoft Xbox is at the top of the hill in wireless controllers.<br>  <br>  The first thing you will notice about the PE2 W2.4 is the great looking deign with sleek lines incased in a metallic clear coat finish. The design is the same size as the Microsoft S Controller so it fits perfectly into most hands. The Eclipse 2 has two sets of black & white buttons, one set underneath the other buttons like the S controller, and the other set is placed on the top of the controller above the right & left trigger. I'm sure they kept the original set intact for S controller die-hard's, but once you have a few games under your belt I'm sure you will be switching up to the top set of buttons. I found the placement and increased size of the black and white buttons to be great use of space and an excellent design decision. I immediately stopped using the small, hard to hit regular buttons and switched up top. I found the buttons extremely useful especially in Activision's new release, X-Men Legends.<br>  <br>  The other buttons that are changed around from the standard S Controller is the back and start button. On the Eclipse 2 the buttons are put in the middle in-between the D-Pad and Left Analog stick. They also added another button in that area which is the power button for the controller. I agree with the power button being needed, but it's really to close to the 'back' button. If you're like my friend Jive when you play a game you're all over the controller hitting buttons like a madman. You wouldn't want to accidentally hit the 'power' button instead of the 'back' button in a crucial part of a game. In future designs I would stick with the way of the S Controller, the back buttons are under the right analog stick adjacent to the 'black' and 'white' buttons on the other side.<br>  <br>  The most important section about wireless controllers is the battery life. Since wireless controllers need outside power you will want them to last as long as possible. Like the Eclipse PL-2006, the Eclipse 2 has amazing battery life which has to be one of the best on the market. Compared to the new Mad Catz Wireless Xbox Controller you get twice the juice! Check this comparison out. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps

But you could try SIMS Online.|`|AA11299045	Not really, this Sims is probobly as close as you're going to get to something like that. Most RPG's involving teens are placed in a fantasy setting and they journey out to save the world. Sorry but what you're descibing is more of a sim game. Try googling Earthbound, for SNES, that may be closer to what you're looking for.

c1c80148a2eaebcbf034c55261e6e729aa	They're commercial games, so the only way to get them completely free is to break the law and pirate them.

aylIst18aa	Prior to the November 7 midterm elections, many political analysts wondered how President Bush would handle the last two <br>  <br>  years of his presidency if the Democrats seized control of the Congress. Nearly all agreed it would be a lonely time for a <br>  <br>  President accustomed to being surrounded by friends in Congress. None of the analyst's observations included the possibility <br>  <br>  that President Bush would retreat from the world stage to the world of online gaming. It appears, however, that that is just <br>  <br>  what President Bush has done as he has been using the "Internets" to do more than to just use "the Google" to look at images <br>  <br>  of his ranch in Crawford, Texas, but is a passionate player of the online game Runescape. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://rs2-gold.com" rel="nofollow">http://rs2-gold.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.buy-rs-gold.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buy-rs-gold.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ro-ragnarok-online.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ro-ragnarok-online.com</a>         <br>  <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft2.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft2.co.uk</a>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buy-kamas.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buy-kamas.com</a>           <br>  <a href="http://www.ragnarokonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ragnarokonline.com</a>        <br>  <a href="http://www.buy-gil.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buy-gil.com</a>|`|AA11698714	if it is anti dragon shield then i dont need because i have many if it mis something else then i am interested my name is shyam3|`|84861a1299b7676766a5a91f65c95093aa	Is that an Anti-Dragon Shields?

But if you are doing the Pink viola's one, it should be quite simple. You will have to try and try and try. Here's a tip from me, try partying a thief that has mastered haste and once they use haste, u will be effected which will make you jump further and faster and more accurate. After trying thos jumping quest, there is one more ahead, when you reach lvl 20, at Kerning, a quest call Shumi's Lost Coins, is more difficult then this as there are JR neckis, Stirge and bubbling which will affect u!!!
ThLyYkmJaa	I think you're talking about Rocket Knight Adventures. <br>  <br>  Here's the write up I found of it (and here i thought it was a Rat all these years).<br>  <br>  Now this Konami game for the Sega Genesis is kind of messed up. A game about some possum in armor with a sword and a jet pack going to save a princess from a big evil pig guy. He has all these armored pig dudes sent out to attack the hero, Sparkster. It is funny the fact that you get to see them running around in their underwear after you take them out...with the sound wave of your sword! If you listen carefully to the music, some of it sounds very similar to the music from "Buster's Hidden Treasure". I gotta say, while the game is frustrating, it's still a cool game. The fifth boss is probably the most frustrating part of the game. The best boss in the game is the giant pig pirate robot who does the Boogie Dance!<br>  <br>  Check out the link because they have a screen shot on there just so you are sure if its the right one.|`|PCVVTiStaa	I think i know what your talking about just cant think of the name of it. <br>  I see if i can find out
6oXEE8ywaa	Mesprerit u have to go to verity lake and surf out to the middle of the lake. Enter the cave on the island in the middle of the  lake.  Mespirit will run away from u but u can track it using the Tracker poke'app.  Uxie and Azlef are at Valor Lake and Acuity Lake (not sure which ones where). Uxie and Azlef dont run unless u kill them, so its a once shot deal.|`|6amLvYBXaa	Define "how" as in where to find them...? <br>  Or how we CAUGHT them?|`|CbF6ytXGaa	Okay, this is the way I caught all of them, for Uxie I used a quick ball. It worked first turn. For the next two I used the same strategy, here it is: First, come at night, next I weakened it to where it was red on HP, then I put it to sleep, I used 2 Dusk Balls, and I caught them.

fbBBWIF6aa	Do you own the actual game or is this a burned copy? If it's a burned copy then its because the CD is named incorrectly.  If it's the actual thing then your CD2 might be defective, or you might be doing something wrong.  Make sure that you take out CD1 and replace it with CD2 (so it's in the same cd drive.)|`|YiEfCySCaa	ther may be a error in the second cd.or it may not have the correct speed of running it.|`|e48f5abd364ee96aeac696fe4a9926edaa	Dude, sorry to say but you seem to have a bad copy of the second disc. See if there's any scratches or dirt that may be blocking the laser from reading it. Or you could get a cd repair kit or you could just get a replacement for it.

dQBAqXCPaa	First I'm going to tell you about the browser based MMORPGs, then I'll mention somewhere you can see the downloadable.<br>  To play games in flash, there are Dragon Fable and Adventure Quest (In both you have to pay to have full access to the game, and notice that Dragon Fable is still under construction and that it's hard for non-members to login into AQ). There are also those community based flash games (that some people consider to be MMORPGs) that are becoming really popular: Gaia Online (that I already played and that is really cool), ClubPenguin, PuzzlePirates, and i think that Habbo goes the same way; in all of this games you create an avatar and play games like fishing to get money and personalize those avatars.<br>  There’s also the pure browser based ones: Tibia is a fairly popular game, BiteFight and Knightfight are OK. Travian is a strategy MMOG, also pretty good. There’s also pokemon crater (but it has a lots of publicity) and, my personal favorite, FallenSword (it’s much like pokemoncrater, only that it doesn’t have lots of publicity, and has a guild system that stimulate interaction, not to mention the lottery and the auction system).<br>  The downloadable... well, i think it's harder to speak about them. I'll also give you a link for the "List of free MMORPGs" on wikipedia, where you can see the downloadable games out there (in this list you can read about other browser based MMORPGs as well). Take a look at the websites and check the screenshots, maybe you'll find some that interest you. My favorites are MapleStory, Anarchy Online, Monsters and Me, Flyff and Silk Road. Seems like Rappelz is also pretty good.<br>  There are also some really good free downloadable MMORPGs coming out: Sword of the new world (where you can control up to three characters at once - but you'll have to pay so that you can get over a certain level) and the global version of Lunia (it's still on closed beta, but will soon come out - keep an eye on it).<br>  See you.|`|2sV3TJdSaa	There is the spider riders game or dragon fable or adventure quest. I've also found one called ogame where you create a planet.<br>  <br>  Sites:<br>  -spider riders: www.spiderriders.com<br>  -dragon fable: www.dragonfable.com<br>  -adventure quest: www.battelon.com<br>  -ogame:www.ogame.com<br>  <br>  *all four you have to resiter for though|`|Q76bsNp2aa	LoL.. the post above me is a script bot..(posts that same post to lots of people asking a similiar question) and nobody even likes those games!  haha.<br>  <br>  Try rubies of eventide.  (www.rubiesofeventide.com)<br>  <br>  It's got like 140 character classes you can choose from and several races you can be.  It's true 3-d graphics and is FREE to play!<br>  <br>  Not like FLYFF or rapplez where if you want to progress you have to buy things out of their store with real money.. there's no hidden agenda, it's actually free.<br>  <br>  And the graphics are much better than the other games I've tried like runescape and maplestory.  Some people are easy to please I guess.. they play those :)<br>  <br>  Anyway.. there is also several different types of crafting and mining, etc.  Lots to do and places to explore.  It's a reall fun game.<br>  <br>  There aren't a bunch of idiots on it either .. well, depending on the server you choose anyway (the "anything goes" servers are just that) since there are constantly GMs online that moderate the chat, etc.<br>  <br>  It's free, give it a try and have fun!

3D0FOthdaa	Slather honey on any tree and wait for about 12 hours. If its shaking then check it and it might be a Burmy. If its a girl, it will evolve into Wormadam at level 20, Mothim if it's a boy.<br>  <br>  For Finneon, you can catch it with a good rod at these places:<br>  Canalve City, Valley Iron works, Fuego Works, Route 205, Route 218, Route 219, Route 220, ad Route 221. You can catch them at levels 10-25, and they evolve at level 31.<br>  <br>  For Lumineon, they're at the same places, but you need a super rod. They both have a 35 chance of being found, so go for Lumineon. And Route 220 has a five percent chance, so don't go there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|EyutewXUaa	to get a burmy slather honey on a brown tree like one near the valley windworks, and check back about 5-10 hours later and the tree will be shaking, but put more honey and the longer the pokemon wil stay. If you put honey on lots of trees it will increase your chances of getting that pokemon. and remember burmys are rare abit, or find a trainer with that pokemon and bam its on your pokedex. and burmy evolves at lvl 20 boy it will be mothim and girl wormadam. And fineon evolves into luminion and you can catch it at route 205-south,218, 219, 220, 221, fuego ironworks, iron mt, canaclave city, valley windworks. (fish wih super rod). or catch fineon in those same places but with good rod, it evolves at lvl 31.|`|g0SLq7XHaa	near a tree that you slathered with honey i dont know why but i still cant find lucario|`|jN1DqObraa	In any Honey Tree.

9QB658mZaa	Well I mainly play with Germans so I will help you there.When you start make another unit of pioneers and start building barracks.Make 2 units of volksgrenadiers and an MG-42.Then make another unit of volksgrenadiers.Send all units to capture points.Before all that start upgrading your HQ (u do that right after your pioneers are made).I suggest you chose defensive doctrine and chose the first line (one with 88's and far sight).When your upgrade is ready build the second german building (the one that gives you halftracks and grenadiers).When that building is ready make 2 paks.Defend your captured ground and get more points.Buy all powers your doctrine allows.Meanwhile make lots of tanks and then storm the enemy.Watch to turn your tank's front towards the enemy because he has best armour there and on the flanks.If you don't have resources for tanks,go slowly with paks they are awesome against tanks but need to be guarded by infantry.Mortars are also good.When it comes to tanks i suggest full upgrade at kempfcraft centre.Than make 2 PZ IV and one panther.make sure you have pioneers in a halftrack following them,so u can repair if needed.Use walkin stuka upgrade for making enemies flee or storming the hard points.<br>  <br>  Those are some tips I use,but every battle is a story for itself.War is unpredictable but I always start the way I wrote here.Happy playing and I hope I helped :)<br>  <br>  P.S.Americans are good with infantry company,just build 2 or 3 howitzers and start pounding.Or choose armoured company,pershings are almost indestructable.<br>  <br>  P.P.S.If you have multiple bridges on a map,destroy all but one if you are defending yourself,than concentrate all defense on one remaining bridge.Also watch with snipers the destroyed ones,so the enemy can't repair them.<br>  <br>  Oh yes,I forgot to tell that it is always smart to wait for the opponent to pick a doctrine first,than see what u need and pick later.|`|746ee4ea75ef353f287fa78d858d84b4aa	Now with the opposing fronts, the best doctrine to pick for the old warmachet is the terror doctrine. If you are up against a British, pick the V1 branch first, if you are facing the American pick the king tiger branch. V1 is specially useful when the British has bunkered down and holding important strategical locations. While the King tiger will form the backbone of your offensive against the American. While the king tiger is difficult to destroy, you shall never send it out alone into deep enemy territory, where it can be easily out maneuvered and get shot in the back.

JM0gw2qDaa	after you buy the showroom near your safehouse. then you have a series of missions where you steal differtent cars for the showroom, and once you have them all, you can collect money from your showroom, and most importantly go to the wheel archangels in ocean flats. another solution may b that youre just bringing the wrong cars. wheel archangels only modifies sports cars. hope i helped!

boV9s0fsaa	Had a person in my dorm that lived across the hall from us.... for some inane reason he wanted everyone to call him P-love (of which i have no idea).<br>  <br>  We got the idea from watching Jerry Springer, when they asked "Are you a teenage prostitute? Do you want to tell us your story?"  So we called the show, i disguised my voice to match his, and told them my name is P-Love, I'm a teenage pimp, and i have 30 ho's in my stable from 16-50, and left the number.<br>  <br>  The show's producers called him within 5 minutes and wanted to fly him and the ho's to chicago.  Needlesstosay he was not happy.|`|wP4c5bbYaa	#1.  GF's mother on disability b/c of  job-related injury-I faked some web pages, and convinced her I had hacked the government.

AA11299045	You have to beat the last stage of the game to unlock multiplayer. Since multiplayer uses all the baton techs it kind of makes sense. It's not that long of a game so it shouldn't take you too long. The only bad thing about it is that you can only use one wiimote, so you have to keep passing it back and fourth, gets annoying when you've got four people playing. But still a great game, have fun with it.|`|f4c02f363e4e2b7f618597bea33617b6aa	Yeah what Icarus said.  you can get like..12 people playing at the same time, but only one wiimote.  this is actually an advantage to have only one controller cuz imagine 12!  Plus, the system can't handle 12 goin at the same time.  Talk about batteries and money.  So really beat the game and then you can do multiplayer.  From my point of view, it isn't hard at all.  It should actually be fun.  Besides, the multiplayer pass it alon gthing makes it funnier to play cuz you start freakin out "OMG WHO"S TURN IS IT!?"  and ur just AAAH!  yeah...have fun with the game and GL!

AA11299045	Naruto: Rise of a Ninja- October '07- Xbox 360 and it looks great. Check it out here. <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/naruto/index.html?tag=result;title;0" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/n...</a>|`|AA12201694	Not sure, but I know it will be for the Ps3 or Ps2.
AA11299045	Well a lot of games are. But that's beside the point. here are a few good ones to check out. <br>  Advance Wars<br>  Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin<br>  Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow<br>  Mario 64 is of course great. <br>  Elite Beat Agents, <br>  Hotel Dusk: Room 215<br>  Brain age and Tetris for cool puzzle games. <br>  Final Fantasy 3 is a decent RPG. <br>  Megaman ZX is a great platformer but may look too kiddy for you. <br>  Everyone raves about Metroid Prime: Hunters but I personally didn't like it, I think everyone liked it more for multiplayer than single campaign. <br>  Anyways, that should get you started, the DS in general has more bright cartoony games, if you're looking for the dark adult games the PSP has more of those to offer. Have fun.|`|750743897d2379028db2363c44f9f2adaa	Try Animal Crossing: Wild World, Metroid Prime Hunters (only if your'e into shooting and guns, though), Tetris (it may be nerdy), or Meteos. These are all my favorite games, but I bet you would find them fun also.|`|AA10210291	i like brain age, and to be fair, most of there best game seem like there made for 12 year olds, but most nintendo games on the ds are a lot of fun. Don't look at it like its "kiddy" but look at how fun thy are, i can't even count the "kiddy" nintendo ds games i have played. I played pokemon about a hour ago!|`|QKFbBEBgaa	if your in to rpgs try " children of mana "<br>  for first person i heard "metroid" is good<br>  try "brain age" to test how smart you are maybe you should be playing 12 year old games aahhh <br>  <br>  just joking|`|fffdacb95231c06c170621e811739692aa	I had a whole list of answers ready in mind, and then I read the 12 year old part. They're all (in a way) like that, but it's not a bad thing. It's not like the games are immature or easy. That being said, have fun trying these games:<br>  <br>  Cooking Mama-you cook, basically, using the stylus. It does sound 12-year-oldish, but give it a try.<br>  Final Fantasy III-not really a 12-year-old game, but it is an RPG that requires battling monsters and whatnot, and you don't seem like that type.<br>  New Super Mario Bros-basically a good platformer. Nothing 12-year-old about it besides graphics.<br>  Animal Crossing: Wild World-great if you like Harvest Moon or the Sims. Graphics are a bit cartoony, but that doesn't mean the game is easy or childish.<br>  Mario Kart DS-the best racing game on the DS. Again, graphics are cartoony, but that says nothing about the gameplay.<br>  Opera DS Browser-if all of these games sound too immature for you, just try buying this. It basically lets you access the internet with your DS. However, it can't download plugins, so no flash ads or animations or games. Great if you're always on the move, don't carry a laptop, and go to a lot of sites without tons of images (like chat forums or yahoo answers).|`|uw2HUGYeaa	Here're a few DS games being pitched to the adult demographic.  I created a slideshow with some video samples too:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.koollage.com/user/user.shtml?fName=d10c5e6b-09c8-497b-8726-aa49dbea169a" rel="nofollow">http://www.koollage.com/user/user.shtml?...</a>

xabCEpTOaa	I doubt one will come out for quite awhile, if ever. The game currently out for the Wii, "Bleach Wii: Hakujin Kirameku Rondo", is a fighting game, so you don't really need to know Japanese to play it.  Importing it may be a good idea.|`|545790cab9de168243c4435268855ac0aa	No, sorry. Do not expect one for quite a while. There isn't a large Bleach Fan base in america, for them to spend taht money. As for importing, both Wii and gamecube are region locked, so you'd have to buy a japanese gamecube or Wii to just play it.|`|0437a3e72c41a133ce2f04b95f8e4c7eaa	when Clorox buys the rights !!!!

9fcYhVxGaa	I think I get what you are trying to ask. You are asking how to use DaemonTools so that you do not have to use the original CD into the CD drive all the time, right?<br>  <br>  Firstly, you have make a CD image of the game. In this case Age of Empires. You can use Nero's image recorder or WinISO or any other CD image making program.<br>  <br>  Then all you gotta do is mount the image onto DaemonTools and it'll be as if a Age of Empires CD is in the CD drive. DaemonTools is like having a virtual CD drive. Just load up the CD image and that's all it takes. You should be able to play Age of Empires without the real CD.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are cracks that allows no CD to be used also, but it's kinda dangerous to look and test them.
V2Uo9ENpaa	Halo 2 for Windows Vista, fast and fun gameplay, sniper matches are just unbelievable. Lots of cool weapons, vehicles, and some pretty awesome maps. Graphics are  good, better than CounterStrike. I give this game a 9.2 out of 10. I suggest you try it out. Here are the requirements:<br>  <br>  OS: Windows Vista<br>  Processor: 2GHz<br>  Memory: 1 GB RAM - 7 GB hard drive space.<br>  Video Card: NVIDIA 6100, ATI X700, or above.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go through all the trouble of getting all the requirements right, then get Halo: Combat Evolved for PC. Its VERY fast gameplay, VERY fun, addicting. This game is very simple, fun, dynamic. Graphics are okay.Here are the requirements:<br>  <br>  OS: WIndows 2000, XP, or Vista.<br>  Processor: 733 MHz<br>  Hard Drive: 1.2 GB - 128 MB RAM<br>  Video Card: 32 MB/3D T&L capable.<br>  <br>  The video card you get with your Windows XP, Vista, should be good enough.

If you are into moderate infantry fighting with some vehicle fighting thrown in then i would suggest the Battlefield Series.  And yes that's a nice list, for PC games.  Your still missing Halo, the best FPS in the history of the world, and come September 25, the best in the universe...email me if you have any questions about game-related topics..sk8rboi89907@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Hope I could help, have a nice night. :)

With MGS4 most people will end up playing it till they beat it and probably be it. With Halo 3, the game has more longevity, being able to go online through Xbox Live and versing other people gives you more options and you'll probably play Halo 3 more since MGS4 is a single player offline game.

b44bfe862fdfa24dc2637363590f46bfaa	GTA Vice City has no cheats for money like San Andreas or GTA3 do. Sorry. =[ But there are some other good helpful cheats in case you don't have them:<br>  <br>  LEAVEMEALONE = Reduces wanted level to 0 stars<br>  YOUWONTTAKEMEALIVE = Increases wanted level by 2 stars<br>  ASPIRINE = Restores full health<br>  PRECIOUSPROTECTION = Restores full armour<br>  THUGTOOLS (or THUGSTOOLS, I can never remember which) = Basic set of weapons<br>  PROFESSIONALTOOLS = Better set of weapons<br>  NUTTERTOOLS  = Crazy set of weapons<br>  BIGBANG = Makes all nearby vehicles explode (Including any you happen to be in, so be careful)<br>  <br>  The full health, ASPIRINE cheat, can also repair a vehicle if you're inside one. It will still appear trashed, but its damage will be reset to 0. This is particularly helpful if your vehicle catches on fire while in a hot pursuit by police. If your vehicle catches fire, just pause, type the code, return to the game and resume playing. Same principle applies to flat tires.<br>  <br>  The weapons cheat can be entered more than once to add up your ammunition.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You have to find a save point to save your game progress.  The save point looks like pedestal that shines yellow light.  You usually find it right before a minor or major boss battle.
iE9sMHlFaa	This is usually a decently long process, after you blow up the tie fighters (i used force lightning) force grip the destroyer, as you do you'll see 2 analog icons show up on the bottom of the screen that'll show you which direction you need to hit to angle the destroyer,after you get it straight pointing at you you'll hear kota tell you to take it down, when he says that pull down on the analog sticks until the tie fighters attack again, at that point its just repeat process|`|H9ozSQCnaa	Here is how to do it on the XBOX360.<br>  <br>  Here's what you do: hide behind a pillar, and wait for an engine core to float by.  Then, Force grip it and use lightning to fire it off at a TIE fighter. When all TIE fighters are gone, move out from behind the pillar, press Force Grip, and then control the Star Destroyer so that it's nose is facing you.  When you see the little analogue sticks on the screen with 'down' arrows, move both of your analogue sticks down.  <br>  Eventually, more TIE fighters will come, and you'll have to repeat the whole possess over again.  It's going to take many, many cycles of this, but you'll eventually bring it down.  I will tell you that the Star Destroyer goes through three 'phases.'  Pointing to the right, to the left, and down and slightly right.  Eventually, you'll trigger a <br>  cutscene. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Alternate Strategy:<br>  <br>  Apparently you CAN Force Grip and Force Lightning the TIE fighters, which makes this level much quicker.  I'm not very good at pulling it off, but try your luck at it.  Apparently this shaves mucho time off of the fight.

37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	Dark Link is a mini boss in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. He also shows up in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, though only as part of the story by the spirit of the Lanaryu region.|`|uctxzjIIaa	I believe Dark Link's first appearance was in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. I never played the game, but I think he's the final boss.|`|1K8NPRUOaa	I know he is in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.|`|58clyxbLaa	in super smash bros you get to fight dark link. also in brawl you can change the color to black and he has red eyes!|`|HpOfzo9Eaa	Dark Link is in Ocarina Of Time, Four Swords adventure, Twilight Princess, and Brawl|`|8SyYiwQKaa	He's also in both Four Swords adventures games. |`|ak3hmsZhaa	Ocarina of time.
f0ZZqykwaa	MGA the makers of the Bratz dolls did a doll/toy in 2003 called Sugar Planet. I think it's what you're looking for. They don't make them any more, but you might could look at stores like Big Lots, Ross and even KB toys. Hope this helps.

0PT1CiGBaa	the key to this would actually be purchasing a decent antivirus and firewall. if you already have all that, check the sight and see how it looks to you, although ive learnt u can pick up viruses now from just browsing myspace! its more a "download at your own risk" but if you choose to, try scanning it before it downloads completely and if you can preview some files in it. if it looks "too small" to be what u want, it may very well be a virus. <br>  <br>  sorry i cant give better advice than that :(

MAP5qJKnaa	When you re recovered your account onto your xbox 360 he will not be able to log on again as you on  his xbox 360. It will ask him to recover the account again if he tries and that requires your email and password. So you will both not be able to have the account available on both your xbox's without having to re recover every time.|`|E0KtKLr6aa	You can have it as a gold account on on console and have it as a silver account on the other, but you cannot play online with both consoles under the same name. Sorry.|`|xOnQM9EKaa	You can only have it on one console so it depends which Xbox you last recovered it on.|`|gAKUFk1Qaa	yes he should be able to but you both cant play at the same time
mKpVnrTVaa	If he is an adult make him go to the computer/newspaper and then click the option that says find own place.<br>  This will make him go to the family bin when your in the neighborhood and then he will be able to buy a house.<br>  I think he has $20 000 to spend on a house unless you cheat :P|`|6TxINNMVaa	Have him Find Own Place on the computer or the newspaper.|`|2eTMstmSaa	Look on the coputer or newspaper for a house.|`|2vWWqbAfaa	Can't move out.<br>  Just kill him.<br>  Then you have a nifty grave!|`|PJuiO6i6aa	if its for the pc you can use the phone or the computer and it should say like move out or something like that.|`|ed4ddbc05d14a3d7bd3939423abb8abaaa	Either click on that sims picture then click on the newspaper and click find own place or click on a computer in the house and click find own place. Then a window will pop up saying who do you want to move out with. Move out whoever you want and then you should be good to go. A taxi will come and take him and then he will be in the neighborhood bin where you can move him into a house.|`|qLepodYmaa	You can go on the computer or phone and look for a new place

KFohCJ8haa	Well, the wire is not a bad idea.  At first I used an adapter, but the connection was really bad and half the time I could not get on.  The wire is also a lot cheaper.  All i would do is run the wire where you cannot see it like the line between your ceiling and wall and plug it directly into the PS2.  I have done something similar to that 6 months ago and it works every time.|`|9tmxkDiPaa	your computer has nothing with getting online if you want to get online if you have cable internet then buy a cable modem plug in your cable in the back of the cable modem then get cat-5 ethernet cable and plug it in the back of your ps2 and the other end to the modem.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Which version of the PS2 do you have?  If you have the fat original PS2, then you need to get the network adapter.  If you have the slim PS2, then the network adapter is included.<br>  <br>  You just connect it to your cable modem or router.  If it's too far away, you can get the gaming network adapter.  Just go to Best Buy and look in the router/modem section.  <br>  <br>  Just insert the disk and follow the directions.  It's pretty simple if you have a router.  A little bit more complicated if you connect it to a cable modem.|`|04d175f4fe3bf0494d5a4da33dae7b5baa	you can't. its not physcially possible.|`|81CHQgDNaa	ther is a whorelss adapotr that you can buy for 18$ at the local game shaft|`|YUyQL7c4aa	I myself haven't heard of a wireless router and I don't think you can get one now because they dont really sell those anymore.|`|iik6ln6Uaa	WTF is PS2 Live???<br>  xbox live man<br>  <br>  xbox=way better.|`|xtm17xIFaa	Most servers are closed by now.

PXWVGQyAaa	You cast off the stitches in the same pattern that you are knitting.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0plhuwVF4...|`|154dzJ1Faa	To knit a scarf, you cast-on, knit according to the pattern, and when it is long enough, you cast-off.  There are many different metods to cast-off, and you need to use the one that works best in your situation. I do have to admit that I like EZ (Elizabeth Zimmermann's) sewn cast-off the best for the way it looks like the cast-on edge.  It can be found on many sites, and in her books (at the library).|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Go to youtube and look for how to bind off knitting.|`|nazmgDW1aa	depending on yarn used you can just cast off the stitches.or you could put fringes on the ends if you feel it needs it|`|vmjztZ1oaa	you just bind off. you bind off by knitting two stitches then take the lower stitch and pull it over the top one. you knit another stitch and pull that over the top one and repeat.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	you simply bind or cast off, it both means the same thing.    http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/casti...  click on the first one at the top of the page.
ReJdZnKPaa	Lol, I don't blame you I play Runescape my self. Well anybody can tell you a whip is better, but an Obby Maul hit's two times in a row, it just depends what you want to use it for. I would use the whip but the whip you can 'share-xp', 'attack-xp' or 'defence-xp' depends what you want to get xp on. Apart from the obby maul, I don't use it at all. Well just when I used to be a pure Pk'er it used to own :)|`|kYyn1ctZaa	Hes all wrong the best weapon in the gaame is the bronze dagger.

ag6RXjJ3aa	One is called the install disc.  Use this one.  It will walk you through the rest.<br>  <br>  If I remember correctly, you run the install disc, then it ask you to put in the play disc and copies stuff, then asks for the cinematics disc if you chose to install that, and then back to the install disc.<br>  <br>  Then you pop in the play disc to play.|`|tMt5qBURaa	I have the game manual:<br>  <br>  put diablo install disc in(disk 1 i think)<br>  if computer is autoplay capable the menu will start automaticly and press install<br>  if not open my computer then select the drive thst represents the cd rom (may have a picture of diablo)|`|x2pJZvhCaa	I can't find my CD's right now, but the disk should have a label on them saying "installation disk" or "cinematics disk"<br>  <br>  put the installation disk in and it should tell your when to change the CD and what CD to put in. |`|ax87mteHaa	Daisy, first put in the"install" disc. follow instructions until is says to install 'cinematics' disc...follow instructions up until it says install play disc. then you should be ready. have you heard of Diablo 2 Expansion Set? 2 more warriors 2 choose from. an Assassin, and a Druid. also..if you can find one, there is a CD out there called '' Shadowmaster" that brings you're powers, speed, agility's to the max level if you want to. it allows you to set them at the power you want to play at. i can't open responses i get for some reason so good luck if this helped. Shadowmaster is for the Expansion Set only. you might need to install the cinematics disc. last i'm ot sure, just follow instructions and you'll get there.
Le7UehSyaa	It takes a lot of strategy to not get killed. The puzzles aren't very difficult at all but you have to know how to conserve your ammo, make head shots, take up positions where the mobs of enemies can only come at you from one direction, and you have to know how to be thrifty until you get to the later levels. It's really fun though and totally worth the aggravation when you die. |`|ttYZ2Vwuaa	Yes it is very difficult. You'll probably find yourself trying to kill the same army of zombies running at you 100 times. The only good thing is that you'll find you're having fun the whole time.|`|rcbeBKDyaa	yea its challenging |`|0kJ4apHraa	Yes. From what I've seen It's the best of all.|`|6xrgDl9paa	yeah it is. you don't even get a break during cut scenes and if you fail at those its game over. very challenging game |`|IpGtRBh1aa	Yeah it is. Also a very good one at that.|`|uctxzjIIaa	For the first hour or two. Once you get used to the controls, it becomes pretty easy.|`|YiFl2em2aa	The version on gamecube was rightly judged one of its best games, so i would say it is a challenging game.

ajomjCepaa	Hi Usman,<br>  That is a broad question and you do not provide a lot of detail, so I will keep this general.<br>  The best model airplane depends on several things.<br>  Where do you want to fly?<br>  What is your budget (under 250)<br>  What is your experience level?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are a beginner.  As such, hard-to-fly gadgets like the hydro boats are not a good idea.  Instead, go over to the beginner forums on the dedicated RC pages that I linked to below.  Read up a bunch there before you post.  There are a zillion question just like this, and there are a bunch of people there that will help out newbies with good advice, tailored to their needs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rcgroups.com/beginner-training-area-electric-8/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcgroups.com/beginner-trainin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/forumid_85/tt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/forumid_...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RjUhISEIaa	My choice for this one would be the hydro plane. Why? Glad you asked!<br>  <br>  This plane can fly. That's a plus.<br>  <br>  Next you can run it on the water as a hydro boat! That's plus number two.<br>  <br>  Lastly you can run it across the ground and that would be plus number three.<br>  <br>  Imagine starting it up...running across the ground...taking off...flying...and then landing on the water and running it as a boat!<br>  <br>  And the price? The link below will show you it's about $110.00 plus shipping!
MTRtqDJCaa	Yes you can, you have to "share" your laptop's internet connection. <br>  <br>  This should be under "Wireless Network Properties". <br>  <br>  Under the "Advanced" tab, check the box that says "Allow other network users to connect through this computers Internet connection."<br>  <br>  After that, connect an ethernet cable from the 360 to the laptop.<br>  <br>  That should do it.
