20090223160221AAsI30e	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How do i charge a heat pump when it is cold out (30 degrees)?	i am trying to charge a heat pump but due to the cold temps (30 degrees today) i can not get refrigerant into the system.  I assume i will have to heat the tank (using the right tool) but im looking for advice as to gauge readings, etc, etc.  I am comfortable with the cooling mode and know how to troubleshoot and charge using superheat, subcooling, etc.  I am not really experienced with heat pumps.  I understand the theory and how it works with reversing valve, etc.  I just have never set one up and have had to change the compressor on my own personal unit so I am trying to learn the basics.  If someone can walk me through the set-up i would greatly apprciate it.  Thank You.

20090223162008AAQgGHA	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Are these colors okay for my townhouse?	I am redecorating after 16 years of the same old color scheme - peach and hunter green.  I am changing to plum.  I have hunter green chairs that I don't want to part with because they are expensive.  The area rug is trimmed in hunter and the center can easily be used with plum accents.        I bought kitchen curtains with blue, cranberry and greenish colored grapes.  They have a vintage look.  I plan to do grape stencils in the kitchen along with place mats of light blue, beige and light green.  I will use grapevines trimmed in light blue and light plum sprigs (flowers).   I will also use a picture depicting the entrance of Italy via water.      The landings will be Paris and New York.  The one with Paris will have the Eiffel Tower and the big-wheeled bikes that were supposedly created by the French first.  A New York mural on the upper landing will introduce the upper level and I will dedicate the whole stairway to New York.  I plan to use Italian red flowers and candles in sconces.      The bedroom will be plum and sage.  The theme of this room I am not certain but I will find something.  Maybe music.        Well, what do you think?

20090223164553AAJUstZ	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Leaky faucet.......please read?	There is a leaky faucet in the house. My mom took apart the faucet and found the spring and washer needed to be replaced. We found the exact same spring and rubber washer in Home Depot and replaced the old one but when we turn on the water (the main water line) the water comes out of the faucet but the knob is in the off position. We can turn the knob and increase the water flow, but when we turn the knob in the off position, water is still pouring. We've tried readjusting the parts of the faucet and turning some pieces 90 degrees, 180 degrees and 270 degrees to no avail. It still pours water in the off position. Any suggestions?? The instruction manual that came with the washer and spring does not mention what to do in this situation and the website for the faucet (the brand name is Delta) does not help either.
