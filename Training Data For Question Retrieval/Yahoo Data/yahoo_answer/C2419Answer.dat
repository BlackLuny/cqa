pVkHzL5oaa	LE 7 MERAVIGLIE DEL MONDO (ANTICO)  Le Sette meraviglie del mondo sono le strutture architettoniche, sculture ed edifici che i Greci ed i Romani ritennero essere le pi belle e straordinarie opere dell'intera umanit.    I Giardini pensili di Babilonia, probabilmente la pi antica  fra le sette meraviglie. Si racconta che la regina Semiramide vi raccogliesse rose fresche in ogni stagione.    Il Colosso di Rodi, una enorme statua bronzea situata nell'omonima isola greca.    Il Mausoleo di Alicarnasso, una monumentale tomba dove riposa il satrapo Mausolo, situata ad Alicarnasso, citt greca.    Il Tempio di Artemide ad Efeso, nell'odierna Turchia.    Il Faro di Alessandria in Egitto, che una volta rischiarava la via ai mercanti che si approssimavano al porto.    La statua di Zeus ad Olimpia, grandiosa testimonianza di arte religiosa, oggi ridotta in rovina.    La Piramide di Cheope a Giza, immensa dimora di riposo eterno del faraone, glorificazione delle sue imprese in vita.

T7Lkmylkaa	I've got two words for you: S.E. Hinton    Then again, technically that's one word and two initials.    Anyway, she started writing in high school, I think her first book was published when she was around 19.    Still, I'm sure hypothetically a teenager could be published. Then again, I doubt it's very likely, considering that publishing is, after all, a business investment.    I really don't think it would be easy, considering that being published as an adult isn't exactly easy. Still, I'm sure it's possible. I'm sure it's even more possible to be published in a magazine, or similar publication, than to get a full blown novel.    If you are indeed a teenager you could possibly pursue that path. Or you could practice, and if you come up with anything good, keep it under your belt until a later time in your life (although that's rather depressing-sounding, and not very fun at all).|`|nYce1Zg2aa	Sure they could.   Theres Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. She wrote her first book when she was 14, i believe, and had it published around that time.     Its just harder for teenage writers. Ive written a book myself, and its like no one wants to read it because they expect it to be crap.|`|NAlKiF0maa	Well, I live in Australia, and there is a teenage girl from Melbourne (I think!) who wrote her first book at thirteen, and was published at fourteen! Just the other day when I was in the bookshop, I saw her sequel out! Her name escapes me, but I guess you could google it. Sorry I don't have more details.   Hope this helps!|`|AA11827424	The only ones I know of are Vera Nazarian and Christopher Paolini.|`|NwpGhT31aa	I hope so because when my book is finished I want mine to.|`|zuZntfiwaa	Just the ones I can think of off the top o' me noggin:    Most recently, Christopher Paolini, author of Eragon, was only 19 when Eragon was published by Knopf.    Samuel R. Delany published his first novel, The Jewels of Aptor, at 20.    Carson McCullers published The Heart is a Lonely Hunter when she was 20.    Thomas Chatterton, at the age of 16-17, published a number of poems that he claimed were medieval. They were highly praised. He later committed suicide before reaching his 18th birthday.    Arthur Rimbaud, the poetic prodigy, was a groundbreaking published poet by the age of 16 and finished writing by the age of 21.    And yes, S. E. Hinton got The Outsiders published at the age of 19, but her publisher suggested that she use her initials to be taken more seriously. Maybe you'll decide to do the same.    Aaron Fricke had his autobiography (but mostly the tale of how he sued to get his high school to allow him to bring his boyfriend to the prom), Reflections of a Rock Lobster, published when he was 19.    I think it would be easier to get taken seriously as a writer of short fiction or poetry when still a teenager, but that doesn't mean you should switch to that. It seems to me it's a matter of talent and/or timing and/or available market and/or the author's own background.

Infatti, costoro che incolpano di tutto il cristianesimo (*) dovrebbero spiegarci perch anche nell'Antichit le donne intellettuali difettavano, per non parlare delle culture asiatiche ed extra-europee in generale.  La ragione della pochezza di donne 'intelettuali' (nel senso moderno, perch di donne che usavano l'intelletto in senso compiuto  pieno il "buio" medioevo, per esempio : basti pensare a sante come Santa Caterina, che ha scritto libri su cui meditano quotidianamente fedeli, vescovi e papi!)  culturale :   con la polemica sociale moderna contro il tipo di societ patriarcale che si sente l'esigenza di una donna che venga allo scoperto e imiti l'uomo anche nelle modalit che erano state a lui proprie fino ad allora. Il quesito  perci da ribaltare : Perch la cultura occidentale moderna sente l'esigenza di avere una donna che agisca come l'uomo? La risposta sta - credo - nella natura parodistica dei 'tempi ultimi'.

1YV3e1ZEaa	For a fiction book, since it is almost Halloween, I would reccomend something by either Stephen King or Richard Matheson.  My favorites by Stephen King are The Shining [so much better and more detailed than the movie. Filled with truly scary things. Ahhh!] and Cell [it's about zombies, which I am terrified of, so it really frightened me. But, it's not the typical zombie story. Much more clever.] I Am Legend by Richard Matheson is a great one. If you have seen the movie, don't let it keep you away from the book. The book is COMPLETELY different and a lot better. There's also other scary short stories in that book.    And as for a bio on someone: I don't know if you like Red Hot Chili Peppers, but their lead singer, Anthony Kiedis, has a bio named Scar Tissue that is pretty interesting.     Good luck. Hope I helped. :]|`|PXa3IUWHaa	wilber smith does really good fiction about the old days in africa, great story teller,  he has other books also on other subjects but most are about africa, some of his books are sagas and have a few which run in series|`|fWNyX201aa	If you are looking for fiction i have a great book. its called Twilight. Its amazing i read the whole series already its pretty good.|`|AA11827424	Combine both with 'The Lives and Times of the Great Composers', by Michael Steen. Get savvy about classical music and history in one go.
eKw0oqvpaa	It might hurt you, actually.  A lot of people refer to author's by their last name.  But on the other hand, it's not really anything to stress over.  The quality of your writing is what really matters, and if you can really write effectively then it won't matter what your name is or who else has it =]|`|eOZ205cxaa	i think it would do both. good because people who like that authors books will look for that same last name, and might stumble upon yours. it could be bad because people might get you mixed up, and people who don't like that author...well that's just bad. i suggest using a pen name. a name that you wright under, but isn't really your own name. |`|tjGN242Yaa	if the other auther is an accomplished author I can't see how that would be a dissadvantage.     For example... if you published a book, and I searched for a book by last name of the author I would then find your book.     I can't think of a negative, its not as if people would think you were trying to scam anyone since it is your real name. |`|cHxaWW0taa	I doubt it, a lot of authors have the same last name, but now you got me curious...    what is your last name?|`|AA11827424	That would depend on how you handle your own act, in fact. It certainly didn't hurt Bernard and Patricia Cornwell.
1ml3HJj2aa	Meh...Yeah he's controlling a bit...but it's only to protect her.  As for him stalking and watching her sleep...well sure it was a little creepy *before* they were together...but afterward, I thought it was sweet...the watching her sleep part...I mean, what else was he supposed to do? And it's not like she didn't know (after she found out). So if Bella was okay with it, I was okay with it.    I love Edward. I wouldn't say I'm obsessed like some other people seem to be. But I love him, one of my best friends who I got to read Twilight was furious with him after New Moon. I told her when she was reading Eclipse "Yeah, I know it's easy to be upset...but it won't be long before you love him again." It took her longer for her to forgive him than it took me lol.    I can see why some people might not like him...but I am not one of those. I agree, Robert Pattinson is pretty gorgeous...but he's a weird good looking...like sometimes he is...and sometimes he isn't....but I guess it can be that way with anybody.     I really hope he lives up to expectations (for me at least...obviously he won't for everybody) In the movie.     Emmett's hair isn't curly in the movie because the actor they chose didn't have time to regrow his hair for this role after his last. That's why.    I keep re-editing my post...but I read something I want to comment on...as far as the whole "He breaks her car to keep her from seeing a friend" Okay...in the *real* world...that'd be a bit extreme...but in the *Twilight* world...he was stopping her from going to see her friend the *werewolf*...a creature who can have a bit of a temper...and obviously that doesn't always turn out well *ex. Sam and Emily*|`|209myqlSaa	YU,MMMMMMMMMMYYYY|`|rycRSTVmaa	the reason is because edward has lived for eternety so clearly edwards going to protect what he truley loves in his really long life.  he can live forever,  and he only wants to live for bella.|`|SozQuXjHaa	OMG!!!!!   I love Edward Cullon!!!!!!!!! i mean he can be a little controlive   but its just because he cares so much about bella.  i dont see how any1 can hate him  |`|uGVca7VWaa	I think he does everything in Bella's best nature to keep her safe... controlling? Slightly. Loving? most definately. Amazingly hot? YEAH  but I love Jasper more.|`|5uZs9HbJaa	POORLY WRITTEN?!?  oh pleasee.  this series is t he most amazing and powerful series I have read yet.  they let niothing get in the way of TRUE LOVE.  stephenie meyer did an amazing job writing it & this book will go down in history.  EVERYONE knows about it.  its the first vampire story that is world wide known.  people say edwards bad because of the things he does.   some think hes bad because he left bella in the second [or third?] book.  But he had to. he had to protect her. & really, I think it made t he book better!  Team edward. hes so gorgeous in the movie! AHH I CANT WAIT!|`|cHxaWW0taa	I think he's poorly written and developed.|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Edward is NOT horrible one bit. I love him to death. I practically admire his personality. He's just trying to protect Bella and he loves her. I adore him for that. |`|Zybe5e4baa	I love Edward, he is what most guys are not. Romantic, polite, sweet, generous, kind, a gentleman, and everything that you would want in a guy.  I love him.  But if i had to choose between him and Jasper, i would so choose Jasper!  GO TEAM JASPER!  Oh yeah, i forgot to say that Edward is beyond hot! Bella is so luckyyy!!!|`|Ez9BouJMaa	NO!!! i love edward, i would love to have a guy like him, yes he is retty controlling but like you said he was thinking of the best for bella, one thing that im gonna love about the upcoming movie is that when i was reading the books i literally pictured robert pattenson, i didnt know he existed, but i think that they did a great job cating him and bella too. the onlything i dont like is that robert patesons voice is very rough, and in the books it was allways described as being velvety smooth... that's gonna bug me|`|AA12181796	Google "characteristics of abuse". You'll find that Edward fulfils a lot of them. The jealousy and possessiveness. The extreme measures he takes to stop Bella seeing her friends. Keeping an eye on her past the point of stalking. Constantly belittling her. Forcing her to do things she doesn't want to do. Taking away items that are precious to her. The fact that Bella is constantly worrying about what he will think of her actions. Abusive, abusive, abusive. Do you know what abusive people often say as an excuse for their actions? That they're acting in the best interests of whoever they're abusing. So nice try, but no.      ETA: mt_everest37 - So Bella shouldn't be around any creatures that might end up hurting her? Oh, wait, that includes Edward and every single member of his family other than Carlisle. Is he insecure or hypocritical or both? I'm going for both. Whatever, sabotaging someone's car and kidnapping them so they can't go to see someone they really want to see is abusive no matter what the case.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	The answers to this question prove how ignorant the average Twilight fan is. One person said "its the first vampire story that is world wide known". Errr, what about Dracula, for a start?    Anyway, to answer your question - people dislike him because he does show a lot of the traits of an abuser. He is controlling. True love allows people to be themselves and make their own decisions.    Also, he's like a thirteen-year-old girl's approximation of the perfect boy. He has no real personality, he's just a caricature of what some people want in a man. He's an empty, vapid character, like the rest of the characters in these books. None of them are interesting, or flawed. The only thing about these characters which stands out is their utter inanity.     Forget how his appearance is described. Forget the fact that Bella is obsessed with him. Look at the facts, look at how he truly is - if any self-respecting woman knew him in real life, she would be swiftly running in the opposite direction.|`|NEHmsq0Paa	i think he is greatly qritten and i wish he was really i mean hes sort of perfect in a way so why do so many people not like him ?!?!?!!? i have no  idea|`|LVK40RKtaa	I read the first one and stopped, but I think he's a good character and I agree, he's just there for Bella and to help.|`|AA11827424	He definitely appeals to emo girls with abusive boyfriends. Somehow justifies the losers.|`|KtS7SUDWaa	because he stalks, sniffs, and does control Bella. He makes all of her decisions for her like when she wanted to go visit Jacob, Edward said no and even made Alice hold her hostage. He sniffs Bella and tells her she smells good which is disturbing. He watches her in her sleep which is also disturbing. He likes stalking her. What girl wants to be sniffed, stalked and controlled? Too bad Bella's stupid to do anything about that.|`|7cpwp1hTaa	SERIOUSLY! YOU WANNA' COME TO OUR SCHOOL!    Ok. 800 Girls (all girl school)   I'd say atleast 700 LOVE Edward Cullen  Then about 99 like Jacob Black    And then there's me - I LOVE JASPER :)    Can't wait for the film    xx|`|9iCaHEilaa	i think he's really sweet and they don't understand how deep his feelings are for bella. He only has her best interests at heart (no pun intended)|`|EHHczlKPaa	Plenty of abusers also have their girlfriend's 'best interests' at heart.    But when a man:  - Sneaks into a girl's house to watch her sleep  - Breaks his girlfriend's car so she can't drive anywhere  - Forbids her to see her friends (or forbids her to do anything)  - Tries to force his wife to have an abortion    I draw the line. Yes, he did it for her safety. Does that make it right?    Forget that he's gorgeous, forget he's a vampire. What if he was just a normal guy, and he purposely broke his girlfriend's car? He can say it's for her good, but that still makes it wrong.    I've heard all the excuses. He loves her. He's a vampire. He really cares for her. You know what? Women in abusive relationships say the same things to themselves everyday. But when you get down to it, Edward's behavior is wrong and controlling.    EDIT: Vampire or not, he's bordering abuse. I don't give a damn what sort of mythical creature he is. It doesn't excuse him from having morals and respect for his girlfriend.

cBltTxPyaa	sure, it's all about the content.  if your writing sounds intelligent and IS intelligent, then you've got something there. However, if it needs serious grammar work and spelling attention, you have to relook that. As far as your idea goes, omigosh yes! you can totally write something like that because you've BEEN THERE... and it's always to the writers best advantage to write about what he or she knows, because then they can expand the most on that topic better than anyone else.  I have a feeling you'll do fine. And as far as getting it on the shelves goes, because you're young, a literary agent might be in your best interest because he or she could look out for any offers that you might not have known about otherwise. You have to get a good novel though first. But yes! You can do it!      GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  |`|yJdhhzypaa	Any fourteen-year-old can write a novel.

There have been (and are) lots of struggles in life, with some moments of really dark periods.  But no where in there would I say I was unhappy with life.      Yes, I try and live each day - but I rather like to look at each day as an opportunity for what it can lead to in tomorrow, next week, next year.  As I said, I am 46 and really glad to be that age.  I enjoyed being 6 or 16 or 26, but I have no interest in going back (been there, done that).     So, yes, I am happy in life.    But, Aristotle said it is impossible to judge if a man is happy until he has lived his life.  There is more to his quote than that, but the concept is, LIVE today, enjoy today.  Don't let life pass you by.  And if you DO live life, you'll get to the end feeling happy about what you've done.    Not everything in my life has been perfect (or easy), but I have no regrets.   Yes, very definitely, I am happy.|`|f4jBeEUTaa	day by day...

But generals are warriors, and they started as soldiers.  Now, for Alexander the Great, for instance, he was so much of a soldier that once he attacked a city by himself because his men were tired.  He fought alone on top of a rampart.  He got wounded and found just a tree to sustain him.  Finally three of his men found the guts to climb and they saw him fainting and full of blood.  They protected him the way they could.  I think one died doing so.  Alexander remained in critical condition for a long time and people thought he was dead.  That much of a soldier he was.    Napoleon was from a poor Corsican family.  And he started as a soldier.  And he remained a soldier, even as a general he had the attitude of a soldier and that is why his soldiers adored him (so did Alexander's soldiers, they adored him). As for Caesar, he was a rich aristocrat, yes.  But he understood right away that to be followed by his soldiers he had to be one of them.  And they adored him too!    Finally, Cyrus the Great.  Yes, he became the great king of Persia, which he founded.  But he started as a helper!    He had no horses!  No soldiers, no nothing.  He had to borrow a little army from his uncle, and he had to borrow horses and then he had to get horses  ... with a soldier's work.  Cyrus, Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon were fighting as soldiers in the forefront, with their soldiers.  I think personally that the greatest soldier in history was Alexander the Great.  He died age 33, with a body full of wounds and marks.      Yet I agree with you that there might be some great soldiers history does not mention.  In fact, so much so that Alexander the Great acknowledged the power and the courage of his soldiers, telling them they will be part of history.  And they are. Even if we do not know their names, they were pretty galant and courageous.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Perhaps the 11th century Viking,Harald Hadrada.He served for many years in the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Emperors,gaining great fame and wealth for his bravery and success in battle.

wsUXFeH2aa	Im not sure I really understand the question, but I'll give it my best...  If your looking for a theme to write a skit about:  You can say that every decision affects how your life will turn out.  Or that decision making is practically blind, and one never knows where that choice will end up. An example is that in Romeo and Juliet, Friar Lawrence agrees to marry Romeo and Juliet, only because he thinks it will resolve the feud between the two families (the Montagues--Romeo's family, and the Capulets--Juliet's family). The conflict is resolved in the end, but both Romeo and Juliet died before a peace was able to happen.  If you are looking for the theme in "A Road Not Taken":  It is that both paths look the same, and that no one can really know where a decision will lead them.  That's the best I can do, sorry! Good luck!

When two come together as one you gain something but is what you give up or lose worth that which you have gained?    You simply will never have it all, If you look at things this way.  It is impossible to survive without mutual give and take.    Now I am hungry.|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I like the money/bank metaphor.

As the poem stands, I've got some issues:     (1) The structure of the poem is OK, but when you're imposing a rigid structure (which is totally fine), you need to count the syllables in each line and also check where the emphasis/stress points are. Here are two first lines from 2 different stanzas:    SHARing yourself means BORrowing - 8 syllables/stress 1 and 6  and  There's NO such thing as freedom - 7 syllables/stress 2    The second example sort of trails off, you see?   (2) The theme is a bit muddy. Overall, it feels like you've strung together some opinions and aphorisms without really backing them up. You've got too many potential themes and not enough development. (My opinion). The best thing you can do is to pick one of the issues you care about and stick with it. (Opinion, again)  (3) The verb "to be" is one of my bugbears. This IS this and that IS that can get to be very tedious for the reader.   (4) Which leads to the last problem, which is emotion or feeling. Since the poem becomes a series of pronouncements, even though it's about caring or forgiveness or romance or self-love (whatever), I'm left unconvinced because the tone is flat.     I very much liked these two lines:   "...forgiveness brings the change,  which is cleansing for the soul."     You could build an epic around those two lines. Anyway, I hope this helps. Keep writing, and good things will come.     All the best.

Searching for a ledge to climb, a ridge to scale, make this rhyme with line 1  All I come up with is dirt beneath my nails, and a mind overflowing with doubt.  While despair floods into my heart, my skin begins to pale. try to get rid of the 5th line    Crouching like a helpless animal; dazed and confused,  I sit against the dark cold wall looking up at the stars.  Do stars ever feel anguish, do they ever feel used?  I wait there in silence for them to answer my plea. make this rhyme with the 2nd line    Ive spent three days lying in this hollow,  Responding to my own questions.  I let out a small sigh, and try to swallow.  Unable to escapeunwilling to. make this rhyme with the second    Feeling a bit desperate, I try something fresh,  I feel the ground that has cushioned me,  That has longed to take me in its flesh.  And I start to dig. make this rhyme with 2nd line    Halfway down I have a realization,  My hands seize, and my eyes close,  How far down must I go must I tunnel?make this rhyme with the 1st line  To realize that Ive gone to farmake this rhyme with the 2nd line    these are just some suggestions.

Only the small child didn't know he was 'not allowed' in the presence of what the others would think to be royalty.    The prestige of the photographer would be an allegory since the girl is only 15 years old and is the only one in the poem who would see and feel what the others around her are thinking.  Only when the girls turns to take the final picture do the onlookers realize the true character of the girl who had been in their presence.|`|OIRgiu1raa	its pretty good for your first time. your poems will get better as you keep writing. the only thing i would suggest is that you would use better word choice.

That said, perhaps the field you'd rather try is graphic design, which enables you to create a visual message by assembling other art components in creative new ways.|`|538ab5ecdacab6b5aa127afe86626733aa	You can still be a graphic designer, but you will be limited.  I believe in today's society you will be worth more to a business if you can draw as well.  An example in today's world would be an animator who can also design 3-D models.  It simply just goes together and in my college at least, drawing classes are required for a graphic design major.      I've taken three graphic design classes, two drawing classes, and 2 illustration classes.  I'm very into being original, so I like to make sure everything I design is 100% original and by me, not borrowing photos and such.  I never took a class, but I also do photography, which I have applied to projects.  (A normal digital camera is all you need, no special equipment.  Any gain in quality is lost unless you are going to print an advertisement 100 meters long.)    I wasn't very good at drawing before taking classes, but now i'm in the top of my class.|`|5Eb8Zlqmaa	I have known several people who have gone into Graphic Design without a great amount of drawing skill.  Today you can create most of your graphics and designs on the computer and with use of technology.    However, you might want to try and brush up on some drawing techniques as well. Just to be safe.|`|hTRJFA4Jaa	If you take courses in Graphic Design they will vastly improve your drawing capabilities.    Drawing is a learned talent, not some sort of gift.    Whether you turn out to be a great artist is when it is a gift.    I would say go for it, I took some graphic design classes and was SUPER happy with the results!|`|3u6iJ9vhaa	No! A graphic art course will make you more skilled in the area of drawing. Look at Weta Digital, the guys who did the effects for 'The Lord of The Rings' films and 'King Kong' - sure, Weta Workshop can draw, but Weta Digital can't. They just do the computer stuff.    Physical drawing and computer design are quite different. But in turn, when you are good at graphic design, you will learn to see the whole wide world as art, so you will therefore develop those desired skills.    Good luck with your course and your career!|`|871f96b408c518577f7be3cd5e409361aa	Drawing is an art that is a little different from Graphic Arts.  But the drawing skill helps in the development of the graphic art.drawing is a basic art  but the graphic art is not.  So i dont find any reason why a graphic artist must be a drawer.  You can very well go for the graphic art & succeed. Go ahead.

I do not look at the age when I am criticizing so.. I am sorry about that.     Anyway, here's my analysis:     Human minds like symmetry... your poem lacked that proper symmetry both in words and in phrase structure. Remember that written words should be good to hear too! And the shifting between long phrases and short phrases is quite... well.. not good for the ears.     It also tires the reader to read a poem like this.     I am sorry but there has been a lot of people offering their writing for me to criticize, both positive and negative. Some are as young as 16 years old (I am in the industry by the way) and of course, I should be fare when judging the work of a 16 and 32 years old. This is the reason why age and their work doesn't affect my judgement.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	that is pretty damn good for an 8 year old
h3gMzNS3aa	"Why isn't 'mineral water' itself an ultimate truth?" > Because 'mineral water' is only a conventional truth and not an ultimate truth. Ultimate truths cannot be broken down further. The essential quality of water is H2O because H2O can no longer be broken down because you'll still be stuck with helium & oxygen. H2O can also be in the form of ice or steam, and we don't refer to these as water. Mineral water is a certain type of water. The problem with essentialism is that it's difficult to state when something has lost or retained its essential 'essense' that makes 'it' what it 'truly' is.    "A table's leg falls off and it's now a broken table. How much damage is required before what we called a table ceases to be a table?"

Keep it up, never stop writing or developing your style, you'll go somewhere one day if this is what you really love.    I liked the poem, but I think with the:  "You get butterflies when he laughs. You feel ecstatic when he waits for you at your locker. You feel like your in heaven when he helps you with math. You feel like you can't stop smiling when he flirts."   part, you should build it up more, like have her emotions when he laughs and waits at her locker as small things and build it up so that when he flirts she's ecstatic and hopeful etc. The question afterwards would have more power that way.    Hope I helped and I don't sound like a know-it-all by giving you a suggestion lol.|`|NK1g8fIiaa	You said you wanted the truth & and an opinion.  So, try to refrain from thumbing me down.    Personally, I don't think it's good.   It needs more emotion. It doesn't seem like a good poem.  Sorry.  It has a good foundation, though.    Keep trying, you'll get better!|`|MBa3xMcWaa	nice !! you can become a good poet if you work hard!!
2KWz3Feuaa	How to read a poem: Read a poem in order to enjoy and savor it. Don't let any rules or conventions hold you back or inhibit your pleasure. Plunge into it with spontaneity, letting your instincts and sensuality guide you. Enjoy it the way you would a sumptuous meal, one that you can eat without worrying about table manners or choking on seeds.  Every morsel can be enjoyed.

Once you have that new car, outfit, or significant other - does your life remain in that perpetual state of happiness? Of course not - either the joy wears away and you need something else to make you happy or what you wanted doesn't turn out to be what you'd hoped for.     it's called life.    The reason why we can't find the end of the rainbow is because we're not actually looking for it. We think we see it, we think we're running towards it because we're searching for that 'one true happiness', but we're looking in all the wrong places and the rainbow isn't it. It's an old wives tale. Stop looking, you already have it.|`|RzbRRUOdaa	Because a rainbow is something optical.      Check Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow    It says a rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that causes a spectrum of light to appear in the sky when the Sun shines onto droplets of moisture in the Earth's atmosphere. They take the form of a multicoloured arc, with red on the outer part of the arch and violet on the inner section of the arch.

Ow3O7h4caa	To silence the note, learn to raise the fingers from the fret quickly enough to shorten the duration of the note. If you lift it quickly, it will have a staccato effect and if you raise it slowly, the note will sound longer but more fluent.

You will distort the sound and secondly, it will interefere with the other notes on the other strings.|`|SdppjUgBaa	learn how to "neck mute"....this is done by lightly touching the strings with the fingers of your left hand.  a good easy song to practice is brainstew by green day...especially during the chorus part of the song.
lL3QQW56aa	I love it. The rhyme makes it more fun to read and makes me love it more!|`|mTkv4MWKaa	I love the idea and your use of imagery, but it could still use a little bit more work.    At times it feels as though you're trying to maintain a common syllable count from line to line, but then something goes a bit longer than the reader is expecting and, for me at least, it can throw off the reader.    Also, ending each line with a period is unnecessary in poetry.  You've already got some good enjambment going on (having a sentence continue from the end of one line onto the next line), but the period at the end of each line tells the reader to stop or pause.  In many instances a comma could do what you're making your periods do, and in a few cases, punctuation at the end of the line is entirely unnecessary.    The rhyme scheme you have is good, but be careful that it doesn't get too sing-song.  When you have a long series of rhyming couplets in can become sing-song and literary people don't like sing-song stuff (though I kind of like it myself ;D).|`|QmWNwHb5aa	It's decent for the most part you keep the general pentameter down (or rhythm rather) it flows and you have some nice rhymes and generally you don't repeat word usage.

D9x1QSgiaa	The Canon EOS 5D Mark II is one of Canon's  BEST and top of the line models. It's a 21 MP camera selling for around $2,500. The Canon EOS 40D is a GREAT camera, but definately NOT in the same class as the 5D Mark II. The 40D has 10 MP and sells for around $1,100.     The Newer Canon EOS 50D falls somewhere in between these two cameras. It's a 15 MP camera selling for around $1,500.     As for the lens,  I would definately suggest the 24-105mm zoom. It's an awesome lens. I believe it sells for around $1,300. but you'll get it for LESS if you buy the camera and the lens at the same time.    As the Canon website reports: This easy-to-use standard zoom lens can cover a large zoom area ranging from 24mm wide-angle to 105mm portrait-length telephoto, and its Image Stabilizer Technology steadies camera shake up to three stops. Constructed with one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses, this lens minimizes chromatic aberration and distortion. The result is excellent picture quality, even at wide apertures. Canon's ring-type USM gives silent but quick AF, along with full-time manual focus. Moreover, with dust- and moisture-resistant construction, this is a durable yet sophisticated lens that meets the demands of advanced amateur photographers and professional photographers alike.|`|7Srd7Pliaa	Outside of a tripod, the glass is the best place to invest your money. If you get a pair of fast f2.8 lenses for two different zoom ranges you will be able to take all kinds of pictures.    I assume that you are coming from film by the "if I decide to go digital" lead in.  The nice glass will still help you with your film Canons (I have my feet firmly in both film and digital).    The bottom line is this: what are you shooting and how much will you shoot?  The 40D has a faster burst mode than either of the 5D cameras.  That helps with high speed action pictures.  The 5D has a full frame so it helps by not forcing you to change how you think about the suitability of a particular focal length.  If you plan on making very large enlargements, the 5D mark II will give you the best results.  However, if your pictures only end up online or no bigger than 8x10 I'd stick with a 40D.    You can always build up your lens arsenal and make another switch later.  By that time they may have a newer and more capable full frame camera for the same or less money.  It's hard to recommend equipment when we don't know what it will be used for.|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	That lens is f 4, not f 2.8. You're referring to 24-70 mm f 2.8.    It will work fine with that lens. Even their least expensive dSLR will work fine with that lens. (You realize that you will get wider coverage with a full frame dSLR.)|`|erf6Dw3saa	The 40D is higher resolution than the 5D Mark II, the 5D Mark II is the same resolution as the 30D, just over a larger sensor.    To use a lens on the 5D or 5D Mark II, it must be Canon EF (not EF-S), Sigma DG (not DC), or Tamron Di (not Di-II), these are full frame lenses you can use on it.    Of course you can also adapt M42, Olympus OM, Pentax K, Nikkor F mount, Tamron T-mount, Tamron Adaptall 1/2, and others to Canon, for any Canon dSLR (or any Canon EOS film SLR for that matter).    I bought my 50mm f/1.4 for $50, an Olympus G.Zuiko adapted for my 30D, its very nice.    I suggest using mflenses.com as a resource for adapting lenses.    in any case, 24mm wont be that wide angle on a 40D, but it will be wide angle on a 5D, depends on what you want to shoot as to what you should get.    And to answer the question, yes the 40D is a good enough camera for a fast lens.    Sometimes its the other way around - the lens isn't good enough for the camera's dense resolution.

Before I give my opinion let me ask you something.  If a person continues their life in routine, always acting the same way, believing the same lessons they have been taught does that give them a sense of self?  If a person suddenly changed their routine, was forced to change the way they acted and learnt new life lessons, is it still the same sense of self?    I believe a person can know themselves to the degree that they allow themselves to. Ignorance or denial can be used as a wall or shield to mask aspects of a persons character that have always been dormant. If those aspects were never uncovered then I don't believe they would ever truly be a part of a person's character, it's not necessary to include that as a part of the self as it has never been given the opportunity to be incorporated in the self.  Now if those shields and walls were suddenly removed then those aspects would be Incorporated into the self, making them known to the individual.    I believe that a person can know themselves so long as they accept all aspects of their personality when and if they are discovered. If a certain trait is never allowed to show itself then I don't believe that it can truly be considered part of the self.  That also means that if a certain personality aspect is discovered and ignored or shunned by denial then the individual does not truly know themselves, or rather, they choose to ignore that part of the self.|`|kqXQA2ILaa	the subconscious is more powerful than selfawareness.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	I do not think that it is truly possible to know yourself.

Wf6UwzCsaa	Their has been much debate in philosophy concerning the issue of free will within a deterministic universe.  Some argue that it is not possible if your actions are simply the result of causal forces at work.  As far as knowledge goes it has not yet been fully established if the universe we experience is indeed deterministic.  One of the main problems lies in the role of the observer also known as the measurement problem in Q.M.  It maybe that our universe is deterministic but thus far this conclusion has not been empirically established.    The term destiny is necessarily intertwined with the concepts of space and time which is proving to be quite the riddle in terms of expressing it accurately enough to satisfy human curiosity.|`|8msce8KPaa	way to state something completely obvious is such an over-mystified manner|`|hHyduuRnaa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1783303 6dzz5z5...|`|e4tvh1d2aa	if you kill someone  will they still get home?  no  if you dont kill someone  will you still go to prison for murder  you change your destiny  with every action  brush your teeth save yourself from dentures  eat right and dont get an ulcer.  dont drink and you avoid liver cancer  kill someone go to prison  easy  no one has the remote to destiny  no one can change ultimate facts  that are founded on events prior  you cant say"poof, now that guy killed someone" and send him to prison  yes i did mention muirder alot in this post.  whats on my mind huh!?

kfOpbbCyaa	I haven't read any Nicholas Sparks books, but I do love both Pride and Prejudice (my favorite of Jane Austen's novels) and Jane Eyre (my favorite out of any of the Bronte sisters' books).    Wuthering Heights is very dark (darker than Jane Eyre) and very passionate and romantic, however there are a couple of the characters who made my palms itch, I wanted to slap them so much. Still it's an excellent book.    Sense and Sensibility, though heavier (not as light and witty) as Pride and Prejudice, is another excellent story. Compared to Wuthering Heights, it is a far easier read and much lighter. I confess to sometimes getting that itchy hand where Marianne was concerned, but not as often as with Heathcliff and Catherine. :) As far as I'm concerned, Sense and Sensibility was a more enjoyable read than Wuthering Heights.    When all is said and done, I'd recommend you read both at some point, but start with Sense and Sensibility.|`|qEh84eqNaa	I prefer Wuthering Heights, but that's because I prefer dark and tragic stories to lighter and happier ones. Wuthering Heights is a book about the two most deplorable characters in all of history (maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get the point) who are head over heels in love but inflict heartbreak and pain on one other (and themselves!) because of their own stupid decisions and selfishness. It's one of the most passionate books I've ever read. It's definitely unique; you'll never read another like it. When it comes down to it, it's really a book about what happens when two people who should be together aren't. It's about two people who break their own hearts. It's my favorite novel.    Sense and Sensibility is easier to read and understand. It's witty like Pride and Prejudice, and as is true with all of Jane Austen's novels, the good characters end up content in the end and the bad ones get their dues. It's not dark, it's not gloomy, and most of the characters are bearable. It still does a great job of exploring relationships, though. The movie is pretty good, too :).|`|11034de0d130c6ac4418af83607e0faeaa	I haven't read sense and sensibility but I loved Wuthering Heights :)|`|14SHluVyaa	Wuthering Heights.

There is a scientific theory that explains why a lot of people go through this phase as a teenager - it's because of the way our brain develops during this time. I remember feeling like this too. What changed it all was that I finished school, went to college/university (where meeting new groups of people helped a great deal), then I started work (it was very busy, too busy to think about boredom). Through time, things will change (I know you will find this hard to believe because the "present time" seems to last forever) but it will.    Meanwhile, joining an interest group at school (what are you interested in?) will give you more opportunity to chat with people with similar interests and who knows, you may see a different side to these people (they may also see another side of you), you may become good friends with some of them.    Good luck!|`|JIwKRZADaa	Join a Speech and Debate club if your school offers it. It's been whats kept me going in high school so far.

0dU50gc9aa	ok breathe. always remember to breathe. in order to sing you need oxygen. heck to live you need oxygen. so...let's check the realities of the situation first. apparently you've never sung in public (or at least in front of your peer group) EVER and you've decided that the ONE SINGLE shot you're going to give yourself is for a pre-collegiate, over glorified talent show at your school and if you dont get in your life is over? really? did i mention breathing. stop freaking out! you've put yourself in this position, which is a dead end, and you've gotten yourself in a panic. this one shot or nothing stuff is limiting and insulting to any natural ability that you may have. if you enjoy singing, then you should be singing...not waiting for the ONE moment to do it. truth is, you may not get it. end of the world....NO! disappointing...YES. but that doesn't mean you can't ever sing again. it doesn't mean your life is over. this should instigate you to get your voice out there. you telling yourself you're a "good" singer means nothing especially if you only give yourself an amateur arena in which to showcase it. and if your friend gets in, you better support her. she didn't put you into this position so you shouldn't rob her of any credit she may receive.     that negative crap outta the way, pick a song that you enjoy and you're comfortable with. don't pick something that you think they may enjoy or your friends want you to sing. sing something that makes you happy. this will help you stay comfy while performing it. i'm assuming that you've done your best work in complete privacy...correct? have you not sung in public ever? pick your song...maybe even ask the music teacher to help. ask someone else to listen to your song when you reherse it. you have to get use to singing in front of people. nervousness is not something that just dissappears...it never goes away. i've been performing professionally since '99 and i've never gotten rid of my nerves...i've just learned to live with 'em. use them. not let my nerves screw up my performance but that comes with experience and a building up of confidence and you can't expect that all to magically show up when you need it. practice. practice in front of people. figure out how to use your nerves to your advantage. but most importantly, do not let this one shot be the make or break for you. if it doesn't happen, move on but keep a look out for other avenues to do what you love to do. don't let a glorified talent show dictate what you love to do! break a leg on your audition!|`|S01zIagOaa	Stop putting so much  pressure on yourself. At the end of the day this should be something you try because you enjoy it, not because you'll torture yourself over it. Go out, give it your best and then lay it to rest. If you're best friend gets it and you don't, be mature and be gracious to her. Your life will go on, as will hers should the situation occur in reverse.|`|ig0miCndaa	Nothing ventured, nothing gained|`|BNPMxfeDaa	OMG!!!!! I'm sooo glad you shared your question and fears!!! I have actually been in your position!! I too had never sung in public but secretly have worshipped the play, "Little Shop of Horrors" and told myself if I ever got the chance to try out for the lead, Audrey, I would. I have all the songs memorized. Well, it happened, the production came to our town, and I actually hired a vocal coach who was affiliated with the production company to help me. I took several lessons, and she thought I had talent! BUT she told me NOT to sing one of the songs from the play, but something else in my range that would showcase me better. SOOO, she picked out a song I had never heard and I practiced night and day and learned it. Well, I was SOOO nervous, I forgot the words in one part, and my knees were shaking soo hard. I didn't sound too badly, but I didn't get the part I had dreamed of. If I could do it over, I'd have sung one of the songs from the play cuz I knew it sooo much better, I could've sung it in my sleep. I found out later that the girl who got the lead sang one of the songs from the play!!!! AAAGGGHHHH!!!!!! Sooo, good luck, stay true to your heart and sing a song you know inside and out!!! And write me and let me know how it turns out!!!!!|`|osjaxa0Taa	hey there...don't worry about what is going to happen...just give it your best shot. there will be others who will are nervous too. You just need to act as if you are not and eventually you'll get to know that you really are not nervous.   i would suggest you try practicing your song in front of the mirror and assume that there are all the judges sitting in front of you and you are confident enough to amaze them.   All the best!|`|blfxu48Maa	First and foremost remember not ever gets ever part they want. In the world of acting getting cast is 80% right place right time and 20% talent. The best thing you can do is go in there and SHINE!     Find a way to stand out, smile the whole time and have a great time with it! If you stress about not being good enough, that will show up in your audition. The stage has a way of revealing everything about what your feeling. so feel great! Go in there knowing that you can sing! Go in there knowing you can act! Even if you can't, confidence is key!    Remember that if this role doesn't work out for you, another one will! Don't quit if it doesn't work out. If you don't get cast, help out behind the scenes! This shows you have a positive attitude and will increase your chances of getting cast in something next time! Directors and Teachers love people with positive attitudes! I actually got a part because I did not get cast, but help by building sets, about a month till the play opened someone dropped out, since I had been hanging around and being positive, I got the part :D    Break a leg and have fun!

2qbLrHBKaa	Because the poem is entitled "suicide," I would say that the "she" the poem refers to the spirit of suicide. The poem uses personification to demonstrate how suicide can strike without any warning- without others around being able to see it coming "invisible," and suicide can strike anywhere "wandering over the earth immense." It can happen to those you love, where you think there is peace (in your family, neighborhood). She waits until people are at their weakest "for sorrow's heaviest and most burning sigh), she promises the sweet relief of death and what comes after (heaven), gives hope to those who are really down. She is insidious because she seems harmless but really is not. The people who commit suicide, or plan to, think it will be a relief, a good thing, better than their sad life. She is both wonderful and terrible in this regard because the relief she offers is really an awful thing. She promises happiness in death    alliteration examples- (there are more you can figure that out)  the repetition of the s sound in the phrases:  She loatheS and ShunS and huntS where peaCe may lie  same for W:  proWels and Waits With Wary and avid sense    You can identify a simile by the word like or as-  "Invisible as a wind" is all I caught in first glance    Sorry I love poetry so I got a little carried away good luck with your homework dude|`|S9bEtVCSaa	it's about suicide.  She can't find beauty in life. She hates life, etc. Then she runs to him "death."
W8F9PboZaa	Nothing is as bad as Twilight.    I haven't read it in ages but it's about some alien bug things that take over earth by invading our bodies. They don't really have personalities but in one body the mind of the human (melanie) won't die and the bug host (Wanderer) listens to her and goes to try and find melanie's family that's hiding in the mountains. She's tracked by another bug called "The Seeker".   Anyway that's not giving away more then the first few chapters. It's not as bad a Twilight. Writing is still shizen though the characters are less irritating|`|ThdFMIFUaa	It was ALMOST better than Twilight.    But hello? Nothing can be better than Twilight. NOTHING.    Read it, I highly recommend it! Read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins too, the three books are similar.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I liked it more because it wasn't about some girl who was obsessed with a vampire and was hopelessly in love with sparkles just because.    The Host is about an alien race that come to earth. The aliens (called Souls) have to inhabit other species bodies. So they come to earth and implant themselves into human bodies. There is one human named Melanie who gets implanted with a Soul but Melanie is too strong for the Soul to completely control.     There's romance in the story as well as the struggle the Soul has trying to live with her rebellious Host body.    I've made it sound lamer than it is. It's an enjoyable read. A bit hard to get into but after the first few chapters I really liked it.    It has some parts of the book that drag on for a few hundred pages when only a few were necessary but I felt it was a good read that occupied a good few hours.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Oh yeah! WAY better than Twilight.  It is hard to explain so I suggest you read it yoursalf.  Basically, these 'souls' invade Earth, implant themselves into all  host human beings they can find.  A soul called Wanderer is living in her human host Melanie, but Melanie starts to come back, so she is stuck in her own body.  Anyway, Melanie finds her lover Jared, meanwile, Wanderer falls in love with a human, Ian, and they all live happily ever after!    Great book ! Loved it!|`|MMmv06Ynaa	i heard that twilight's better|`|YWSGLxPqaa	Twilight was soooooooooooooo much better!  The host is basically about these "aliens" ,if thats what you would call them, that take over peoples bodys. Not that creative. Although i love stephenie meyer she could have been more creative. Twilight was original and different.

YEfW3vI0aa	Yes, all the facts are true, but the plotline and characters are completly fictional.  Take what you can from the book, I say, and believe as much as you want to, but the facts are laid out on the table.|`|XZBJNwi1aa	It's just a story pure and simple.  Brown is an amazing story teller but just because some things are rooted in fact doesn't make them fact.  Okay I'm not going on my soap box on this, (trust me I could).  Look into stuff debunking the da vinci code; it might help you reconcile what you read (like this link http://www.catholic.com/library/cracking... )    God bless,  bb blue|`|HBrIHYrMaa	I red a some parts and it also shocked me a little bit.... I stop reading it coz I can't take it any longer.....I'm also a catholic and I think the story is false...some say they're only trying to accuse the church but If you're a devoted catholic then try not beleive it.....    .....xoxoxo.....|`|r68xD4JFaa	No the facts aren't all "true".  Basically Dan Brown cribbed a lot of it from a book called Holy Blood+Holy Grail.  This book was filled with a lot of conjecture, most of which had no supporting evidence.  Much of which ignores substantiated historical theories.   So it'd say things like "what if jesus had a son?" give some evidence, none of which actually proved anything, and then would go on from there to "what if that son moved to France?"      The books have a lot of interesting information, but they also contain a lot of amateur history. The type of stuff you dig up on the internet, but if you look into it you find there aren't any actual historical documents supporting the idea, other than "wouldn't it be cool if..." ,"well if nothing disproves it...", or "isn't it strange that we have no firm evidence contradicting this..."       You also find a lot of nonsense, since manufacturing historical documents about various secret societies has long been a cottage industry in Europe.  Just as some people have made money off faking evidence to support wild theories about JFK's assassination, people have made money by faking up detailed histories of supposed ancient secret societies.  So you find a lot of facts to be muddled and a lot of unsubstantiated claims.|`|usvPMtMtaa	didn't phase me|`|de0e13b53b8247e94598d0825137ca7baa	Many parts of the book are rooted in fact; Dan Brown was sued by two historians whose non-fiction book "The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail" was used by Brown as the basis for the Da Vinci Code without citation.  I have not studied it as I found the Da Vinci Code poorly written, and frankly I thought the "shocking facts" were pretty much common knowledge.  For your own peace of mind, I would try reading the non-fiction book the novel was based on; I would avoid the many books that tried to cash in on Brown's success by claiming to either explain or debunk the Da Vinci Code AFTER it was popular.

QmWNwHb5aa	Well it all depends on how much to the story their is.    For example if i had a story about a girl who gets a brand new bike and thats really the whole story, it would probably only take a few pages. If its a story of how her bike was stolen and all the misadventures she goes on to get it back, that could span far longer.    In no way am i telling you to change your story (as i dont know what it is) however you need to write with what you have, this is key. If you can't make a novel out of a short story, its not a bad thing - its because you're not suppose to. And in that same context some novels cannot be made short stories, imagine if harry potter spanned 10 pages...    Also however much of a writing cliche it is - show don't tell. Don't say 'she smiled as though she had never smiled before' say 'an explosion of joy overtook her face and she was never the same again'  Well don't exactly do that, but do you understand? Although be sure to manage detail because more detail is not always better, actually depending on how much you put in you can give certain feelings to certain sections.    For example if your character is waiting for bad news, she's on edge - every little sound she hears and all movement is intensified because she's nervous and trying to distract herself - so here a lot of detail is good. But if someones in a hurry, they don't have time to stop and smell the roses so a lack of detail is good here.    it's hard to give generic writing advice, good luck.|`|XXc15qzzaa	1 Write an outline for your plot. I know you probably have it in your head but showing yourself the structure visually will keep your story more tightly reigned in as far as wandering goes.   2 Don't write ANYTHING that doesn't move the story plot, or character development forward. This is so much harder than it sounds but you'll appreciate it later (after a long time of tears and gnashing of teeth when you feel like the story's soul is being torn out). After you've finished you can go back and add a little fluff here and there, but not too much. Humor really (for comic relief purposes) and other forms of wit are really the only extra's your story should need.|`|wxQKwBXNaa	Somethig suspencful, entertain vocabulary.

9UvkRIdraa	I think your poems are good :) Keep it up!  Every poem doesn't necessarily need rhythm, but I think they flow much better if they do.  Sometimes, though, when people make a poem rhyme, it seems too forced and it's not as well written as it would be if they didn't make it rhmye. A free poem means that it doesn't rhyme, there's not really a structure to it, and it's really just thoughts or things that someone wrote down on paper and called it a poem.  But I think that you are doing great with your poems, and I can tell that they come from your heart, and that you are passionate about writing. Good job, and keep writing!! :D|`|LoXvNBEmaa	poems don't need rhythm, poems can be formatted however you'd like  i think what matters in poems is the meaning and feeling behind it, and energy should be spent on that. when there is passion behind a writing, you can feel it and you don't need to try to make it sound a certain way.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	Rhythm not necessarily, but it does add beauty to the poem.

lPxVt2XYaa	The three main problems with Lenin's leadership style, which is not addressed in this rather sketchy passage, are firstly that the party was formed in exile, by the leader of an illegal party - Lenin.  The party, the Bolsheviks, had a cell structure, like modern terrorist organisations - so that if one is captured, they only know the names of a few members, not anyone in the leadership.  This structure carried on even when they became the ruling party.  The structure meant that the party was easy to manipulate by a clever administrator - and it was, by the person in charge of party membership, the General Secretary - Stalin.  The other main problem, one never addressed by the Soviet Union, was that Lenin never put in place a mechanism for removing the party leader - mostly because he was intellectually arrogant, assuming that no-one was clever enough to replace him.  This meant that when a tyrant - Stalin - took power, there was no legal, procedural way of removing him, other than waiting until he died.  The final problem with Lenin's idea of leadership is that, because he was unchallenged as leader, and because the whole party looked to him for ideological guidance.  In opposition he ruled the party in an authoritarian manner, and this became a dictatorship on gaining power.  See:  Lenin, A Biography by Robert Service  http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?p...

QskxXcKhaa	You should call the school and ask if you need dancewear for the first class.  Many times the first class is just an explanation of what the rest of the semester will hold.  They might also have dress code regulations that will be explained then.    Ballet depends on precise alignment, so practicing things from books or DVDs before you learn them in class might actually teach you bad technique you'll have to unlearn, so don't try doing ballet at home to get ready.    Once the class actually gets going, you can expect to start very slowly, learning isolated positions and movements (like plie's) at the barre.  After everyone is warmed up, a traditional class moves to the center to do stuff across the floor.
ZntkO9ffaa	It's terrible.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	I think everyone can relate and understand your message in this poem. We've all been there before. Good job.|`|lKof1n0Xaa	It's two-dimensional, not enough description, not enough similes/metaphors etc.   I think good poems are poems that sort of leave the reader guessing, so that they're open to interpretation. Try focusing on a feeling, but then describing it as something else, like an ocean for example. You could also try to have more morals/issues/themes in your poems, instead of focusing on just feelings. Try to make the reader think.|`|1o3OqSioaa	I can see that you began to struggle with the rhythm of the poem at about the third line from the end. Am I right?  I really like it until then, and then it sounds like some of my poems when I can't figure out an ending, so I fake it. I have some poems that I wrote years ago and still can't get them the way that I want them to be.  It's very frustrating, but I found that if I write it and then wait a day or so, then work on it again, sometimes I find just the right words to make the poem turn out just as I had intended it to be. Good luck with it and never let anyone stomp on your dreams.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	How about changing the last line as "Better to move on to break the resistence",|`|2qbLrHBKaa	I think it's great. I like it a whole lot. The ending could be tweaked a little bit, but it has a very nice cadence|`|G5JpK5Puaa	You definitely need to work on the rhythm. Poems need to be read out loud and needs to sound good. Work on making each line roughly the same length. THEN it'll be excellent.
WATlJNKvaa	yeah i loved it but i don't know the plot. anwyas you should go on http://www.webook.com/home its a place where you can post your book and have people give you feedback so you'll know what you need to improve and what you don't. it's really a great place to start writing. and no one there is able to steal your idea. =)|`|XXc15qzzaa	This excerpt tells me nothing about the plot line and very little about the character.

I would totally beleive you are in 8th grade.|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	I think it's very good.  I like where you started.  A point where you don't really know what's happening and then you built up.    I believe you're in eighth grade.   I used to have a passion for writing then.  So, yeah :D!

HgeBc8IPaa	The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks    A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever.     Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again.     Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape.     Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.     "I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."     And so begins one of the most poignant and compelling love stories you will ever read...The Notebook|`|XXc15qzzaa	Wuthering Heights  The Giver (though it's not romantic, but it is about intense, deep, endless love)  Ella Enchanted (sorry if your a little old for it, i don't think i'll ever be)  PS  I Love You (amazing book)  Tuck Everlasting  Narnia Series (though once again, not romantic, but still fits the criteria)  Tuesday's With Morrie (ditto)  Rebecca (kinda romantic, more of a creepy one though)  Frankenstien (not at all romantic, but about love of life)    To the person below:  yeah, that's the one. Love that story!|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Person above: Was that Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier? Cause I have to agree with you if it is.    And I agree with the other person who said the Notebook. I found it to be incredibly romantic. I cried whilst reading it...

VvtukmvDaa	idk they are young.... they will learn the hard way|`|FoIxsunVaa	Somewhere between you and them there is a happy medium. Me, I prefer economy sized caution.|`|fj78wRV5aa	They'll learn. Maybe the hard way, but if that's all that might teach them skepticism, then I suppose that's what needed.|`|OikNR8Ufaa	because everyone wants to have friends and be popular I guess. Young people dont think, they are too busy trying to keep up with the crowd.|`|ik8Y15FCaa	well its not bad as you think  all these people tell you dont add strangers  or else you'll get raped  if you look at my profile  there are no signs whatsoever about my personal info about where i live  or anything else  and not EVERYONE is a sex crazed adult looking for some kids to   f u c k  there billions of users and only hundreds of "actual" stalkers and preadators      sorry if this dosent make sense|`|H90Qh5Hzaa	Because that's how teens our, naive. And they just wanna see who can have the most friends on Myspace and believes everything they see on Myspace, especially those stupid chain reposting bulletins. I have a Myspace but I just have it to keep in contact with friends and family. These days it's a popularity thing.|`|AA11488628	because they still have lessons to learn. sometimes you pay for these life lessons in ways that are unfair. life is unfair. people should help their children be internet smart. they would not get into a car with a person they first met why would they talk to people online who they also don't know? children and teens most of the time have it wrong and think they are invincible. bad things happen to other people not them. this is faulty and people need to be preparing their children for the world. not protecting them to the point that it makes them setting ducks. it is still a battle to survive but the players have changed. we no longer have to fear lions and bears but our own species.|`|v7fsd02Naa	kuz there all dum nerds, but theyll learn, the hard way|`|jDsoVZK9aa	Because they are also naive and gullible in real life.    If they were not, why do so many believe in miracles?|`|nBkHjCFQaa	i think it fits somwhere in networking and its the IN thing to do right now, to compete over myspace friends. its not so much naivety or gulliblity as it is desire to belong.  i dont have any social networking site membership anymore.|`|iQXVkB8qaa	I DONT BELIEVE YOU! jk

Try to broaden your mind and think outside that box! =D nice attempt though. i want to hear another one soon.|`|pe4uGaZbaa	sounds like an about me section of a facebook page. Has potential but its boring|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Any poem that is creative is art and is great. I think in your next one you could try to be less literal and be more figurative-- try to paint a picture with your words, use exciting, colorful and provocative verbs|`|G5JpK5Puaa	UHHHHH....You're a hyper, ditzy kinda girl aren't you? Sorry if you're actually a boy. It's not so much a poem as a collection of New Year Resolutions. No offense but I don't think poetry is your game...Good Luck anyways!|`|QmWNwHb5aa	I'm being honest, it really doesn't sound like poetry. I'm well aware that 'poetry can be anything' just like 'art can be anything'. like when somebody dents a trashcan lid and they sell it for 1000$, no believe me i've seen it happen.    I'm not saying this is bad but its not exactly poetry its more a description of who you are and its very static, it doesn't flow or have rhythm. Its just like a series of sentences. Also the only common thing is that they're all about you, which in poetry there needs to be more of a common thread or at least a circling back around.    My poetry teacher once told me that what makes poetry - real poetry and seperates it from fiction is that while fiction tells a story poetry tells several, and this barely tells one.    I'm sure you're a nice person and its not like this is bad, but i don't consider it poetry, sorry.

draNVjbkaa	Here are some things to consider:  1. Male pornstars don't get paid as well as female stars do. So going into it for the money isn't a good excuse.  2. Despite all of the required testing and precautions, it's still a very risky business.  3. Do you mind having a bunch of other guys in the same room holding cameras and boom mics close to your crotch?    Ways on how to get into porn:  Your best bet is to go to those adult conventions such as Eroticon and AVN and network like hell.    Some famous pornstars also offer escorting services. If you pay for their companionship and you're a great partner, then maybe she might recommend you for her next project|`|lKof1n0Xaa	hahaha, I love how this question is in the theatre and acting category.   I'm not too sure actually. Try newspapers, lol.|`|osjaxa0Taa	i think you can start off with submitting your videos in youporn and that can serve as your online resume. Forward that to some related person. i think you can have the chances to get close to someone who can really help.|`|S01zIagOaa	Male porn starts in heterosexual porn do not make "The big bucks". Male porn stars in gay porn hardly do any better. In fact, the vast majority of porn stars, male or female, do not make big bucks at all. They barely survive from job to job. The porn industry will suck your soul dry.|`|6mZJSqBgaa	I guess submit pictures and videos to various porn companies.  But with any acting job, porn or other wise, it's a highly coveted gig and probably takes lots of luck or ambition or both.    Try to have a schtick of some kind, something that will make you stand out.  Like a clever porn name or a tattoo on your penis or something.|`|HzV1LeIvaa	Hmm, size, girth and acting.  (yes even if she is as loose as an old cow you have to pretend its enjoyable.)    search up Mandingo and Lex steele videos.    Oh oh oh... and you might need an agent.    (:|`|2cc2L7STaa	well, you have to look great, and have a huge penis|`|hwvQy100aa	Somebody has to do it.  You need to be considered relatively good looking.  A large penis that has staying power, going again and again.  This is an 'inside' industry, so the more you network and get to know people, the more contacts you will make leading to work.  Big bucks is a myth in porn unless you are some kind of freak like John Holmes.  You will eventually be used so much that you will become boring to the audiences, and your appeal drops like a lead balloon.  You are then subjected to the humilating task of virtually begging for work in sub-standard, cheesy productions.  Not much of anyone will see you as anything more than a piece of meat.  Your self-respect erodes and you are left burned out.  But if it's your thing, go for it.
iZZlhbrJaa	when I did mine with in my drama class there was a guy and me and we had gotten drunk the night before and "slept together" he was kind of nerdy and I was your average cheerleader preppy girl, he woke up and saw me then took a pic with his camera phone and then went to take a shower and look presentable. I woke up and was like wtf? then he came back into the room and we stared at each other then i ran out. I don't know if you could make that last 5 mins. Ours was about 3, but my class really liked it and we get to go to the district competition.

WshwHtk9aa	And what "talent" did she scout in your merely walking down the street?     I would tend to think that it was someone looking to make some money in a slow economy off the dreams and hopes of someone who doesn't know what they are getting into. Go if you want, but if they ask you to buy ANYTHING, walk away. They'll fill your head with images of glory and fame, but if they try to push acting or modeling classes or something on you, just get up and go.|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	i think its worth trying  it sounds like its real  but if you decide to go  you should definitely have someone go with you   and if they ask for any money up front  it is a scam.  agents get paid by commission  that means when you get a job  they get a piece of the money  depending on the agency's depends the percentage|`|AA10729271	Good question, there are a lot of bogus talent agencies out there, but if you are seriously interested there is one simple way to tell if it's a scam or if it's for real. A real scout who thinks you have talent would be willing to invest in you, simply put she is going to offer you some type of job and you should start getting compensated for you efforts fairly quickly.    A scammer on the other hand makes their money by appealing to your vanity and dreams of fame, they will recommend all sorts of things you should do to 'improve' yourself out of your own pocket. I know a girl who got taken (or her mother got taken) for about $800 for a professional portrait sitting, they paid up front and then on the day of their photo shoot the photographer cancelled, after a couple of weeks when the didn't hear back they tried to get hold of the scout, except their cell account had closed. So basically, if they are expecting you to pay anything other than perhaps travel costs you are probably being scammed.|`|HpqGnCFAaa	If you dont know them and they dont know you how can they know who you are. I wouldn't!! If you did take some friends, a cell phone, and, a knife|`|nBkHjCFQaa	it's most likely fake  a lot of fake companies can go to extremes as faking company websites.  Scouts in general have to be notified of talent, the only time when a scout doesn't need to be told of a certain person and their talent is when the person is extremely talented and well known.|`|Lf4jMeSjaa	Hm. It seems like it could be real, but the fact that this person stopped you on the street is kinda weird. (no offense) I would talk to your parent about it, and then have them come with you if you do decide to go... that way they cant take advantage of you. :)|`|Q4uRndK0aa	Dont go alone, bring your parents.  Then if they ask for money up front its a scam.   Remember...  THEY work for YOU!
cR8UZdi1aa	Woe... to vague. Do you have a photo of it you can post?  Have you tried googling the "A.00COMBO"?  Do you know where it was originally purchased & when?  Do you know what it's made out of (i.e. Ceramic, bronze, plaster, plastic....)  This would help figuring out a price to put on it.
30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Plato's dialogue "Gorgias" deals with a discussion between Plato's teacher Socrates and the sophist Gorgias on the nature of rhetoric.  In it we find two principles that are associated with much of Plato's philosophy, that it is better to suffer evil than to commit it, and that when a person commits evil it is better that he should be punished than not.  It also addresses the question of whether something is good because the Gods approve of it or if the Gods approve of it because it's good.  That one is still being argued since Plato left the question open.

280dd58dd120cca55b24aed29c6b90beaa	Colonialism.   It began around 1492.  European countries, USA, and Russia (earlier still) thought it their right to conquer territories inhabited by a population not  advanced as their own.  While europen countries were busy in Africa, South America and Asia, the USA after their independence, began conquering parts of Mexico, Hawaii, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Panama.    This was the ussual thing at the time.    "Do not  judge the past with the priciples of the present".|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The major powers still believed that they had the right to have "colonies" where they would control the government and the natural resources. It was a continuation of the 1400's when the Pope divided the world into 2 parts controlled by 2 European nations. France saw Vietnam as a source of rice and spices and rubber..|`|05anyV31aa	you mean the 1880s during the Sino-French war of 1885.

It was WW2 that helped the USA out of the depression.|`|AA10303012	We had to enter the war, the world would have been completely different if we hadnt.    The Germans would have eventually conquered and defeated Great Britain, the last hold out of freedom and democracy in Europe.  All of Europe and Russia would have been under control of the Nazis.    The Nazis did have plans on developing a long range bomber air craft too, one that would have been capable of crossing the Atlantic to bomb the eastern seaboard of the US (New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Baltimore, Atlanta, Miami)  In addition, their scientists were working on the development of the atom bomb, and were only a few months behind the bombs creation in the US.    If the Nazis did win the war, they would have conquered the entire world.  The extermination of the Jewish population was only first on their list, they also wanted to eliminate Catholics, homosexuals, intellectuals, blacks, gypsies, the mentally retarded....essentially anyone who wasnt aryan by birth eventually.    So, you want to play devils advocate?  You probably wouldnt have been here to even pose this question, neither would your parents or even grandparents|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	No reason not too.

Then its bad. but if the US didn't interfew than more jews would have died. more that six million. And US was against killing jews anyway so they would have attacked us eventually.

SdppjUgBaa	the best answer I can give is....WHATEVER SOUNDS BEST TO YOU!!!!  the standard and most common starting point...will put your *tuner first, the *wah (envelope type effects), next put the *acoustic simulator, then personally I would try the *tremolo after that, followed by the *chorus, last, *delay.  now in the future you may get a distortion/overdrive pedal, people will generally put that before the chorus/phase type pedals. personally I would run the guitar straight to the tuner, simulator, wah (in that order) to the amp, effects loop output to the trem, chorus, and delay, back to the loop input on the amp (in that order).
Q7EN2Zqbaa	Yeah they're very good,I especially love the third one. I'm not a photographer but I say do what you want with the special effects.  That may be of no help, me saying that, but art's subjective. Noone can tell you your work's incorrect.|`|7fJeEwGFaa	It's average.  I like the first one the best but it's on a bit of an angle and leaning to the right. If you shot it straight on I think it would look better.  But it's still just a snapshot, try doing a long exposure or change the composition to make it more interesting.  The blurring in the 3rd one could work but I think it's a bit over done.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	It is wonderful to experiment with your camera and tackling different types of lighting is wonderful for the learning process. When you do images like this, your main subject needs to be in focus for it to be successful. In this case, nothing is in focus. In such low light you need a tripod or a table top and a timer to create a sharp image. That said, even if tack sharp, there is no main focal point, no statement to make it a great image. As you have fun and get used to the new camera, search out information on composition so that you will not only improve technically, but aesthetically.    PS, the dog is beautiful!|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	good for me but expect well written comments
BjBkO0CSaa	Women were definitely not treated well in the Crucible - if you know what the play is about (or have read it) you know it's set in the Salem Witch Trials period.  Not only were women persecuted during this time because of superstition, but it was colonial times (1600-1700s) so women weren't exactly equals with the men.  You will notice, though, how Abigail (the villain) is able to gain lots of power (being just a girl) by manipulating the society's fear of witchcraft.  So basically, women are kind of pushed around and blamed for being witches (without good reason) - if you've studied the Salem Witch Trials in history, you'll know that it wasn't based on rational claim {obviously, they weren't really witches} but people were just scared.  [ie - one of the punishments was having rocks tied to your feet and drowning you - if you survived, you were a witch - which meant being burnt at the stake, and if you died it mean you were innocent] That kind of sucks, doesn't it.  Hope that helps, good luck (:|`|NYU37jfGaa	While it is true that the majority of people accused of being witches wee women, so, as you will notice from 'The Crucible', were the majority of the accusers.  Women accused other women (and men) of witchcraft.    Moreover, people convicted of witchcraft were not burnt in England or the USA, they were hanged.

Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	I feel like everything we do in our lives can be seen as a spiritual experience, a step on our ongoing life journey.  Whether we experience the spiritual impact of the moment might be another matter entirely.  I don't know if "focus" is the right word, but I do the best I can to remember that there is nothing more important, powerful, wonderful or exciting than love.  If I can get my head into that kind of headspace, it is much easier to feel connected to the spiritual realm.  Best wishes!|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	God

XMXlXu0xaa	Normally werewolves imprint on humans, and when the human ages they age with them. They actually get to choose when to age, because all they have to do is stop morphing. Since Renesmee will live forever, jake can just keep on phasing adn he will also live forever. Great question though, at first I was like confused, but then I worked it out (:    EDIT: They can't turn Jacob into a vampire because he is a werewolf, and vampire venom is poisonous to them.|`|lKof1n0Xaa	Well the whole reason for Jacob being a werewolf, and in that case for a werewolf's existence is because vampires exist-Jacob's ancestors are protectors against the cold ones. Seeing as Jacob will always be around Renesmee, therefore always around vampires he will stay a werewolf as long as there are vampires around him-making him (technically) immortal too.  Jacob's actually not a werewolf, but a shapeshifter. Anyway, my point still stands.|`|vpvir0f1aa	yeah.... at first I didn't like it but hey, if Jacob gets a happy ending too, it's happy for everyone..... he will start aging sometime but Nessie couldn't turn him into a vamp because she's not venomnous..... too bad..... maybe Bella would because I kinda doubt Edward will.... that is if it's possible for a werewolf to become a vamp...|`|In6t9yiRaa	jacob's gonna keep phasing cuz Nessie's half-vampire, and since he's always with/around her, he'll never age     omg it's sooo perfect!!

jGgOVd5Zaa	Poets don't tend to make a lot of money.  That said, making money at poetry depends on how you market yourself.  You can try to write a complete book of poems and sell it to a publisher or you can try to sell your poems individually.  The best way to get started is to find publications that publish poems and look at what kind of poems they publish.      I had a teacher once who was a  poet.  He liked cats, so he wrote poems about cats for cat magazines.  He'd get $25 or so per poem (this was years ago.)  It wasn't high art, but it made some pocket money.  An important step once you find a publication that you want to be published in is to find out what their publishing guidelines are.  This same teacher used to submit poems to a major magazine and they never published him.  He looked into it and found out that all the poems they published were short little ones  that they stuck in to fill up page space after articles.  He started sending them shorter poems and immediately started getting paid.  Pick up a copy of Writer's Market if you want to find a good source of places to publish or just look around the internet or local library.  You are probably more likely to get an O.K. poem published in a magazine that has a lot to do with what the poem is about (like a cat poem in a cat magazine) than a good poem published in a magazine that has nothing to do with what your poem is about (like a poem about dogs in a cat magazine, or a poem about love in a car magazine.)  Keep track of where you get published and use that marketing yourself.  If you get published in Rolling Stone, let other places you are trying to get published know when you submit stuff.    You should also read up on copyrights.  There are different ways to sell your poems.  You can sell none of your rights or all of your rights or some of your rights.  For instance, you can sell the rights to be the first publication to publish your poem, or you can sell the rights to be the only publication to ever publish your poem (essentially making it their poem.)  Some publications will only buy under certain conditions.   It can get complicated, but don't let that stop you.    Of course, the other way you can go about it is to publish them yourself, either physically or on the web.  Sometimes publishing on the web is a good way to get some buzz going, but it's a hard way to make money.  There are ad companies that you can make deals with that will place ads on your web page and pay you based on how many visitors visit your page.  They key is you really have to market yourself.|`|ZntkO9ffaa	It can't.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	poetry made about 5 people a buck ever.  What are your friends, literary critics?  What do they know?|`|pe4uGaZbaa	If you really think you can be successful check out writers collectives in your area. Unfortunately, it isn't something you can support yourself or a family on. I just finished a project designing a book for the latino writers collective in my area and they all have full time jobs outside of their poetry. Maybe you could look into teaching as well.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	It can ony be a side business or a hobby. However, you can go along submitting your poems to publishers of repute and may be in the long run, you can emerge as a famous  and excellent poet winning laurels and good income. You can always devote your spare time  to. compose, edit and send your poems to publishers, especially if you can get into a job in newspapers, magazines, publishers etc.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	First what you need to do is enter your poetry in some writing contests, take some poetry classes and speak to the teachers about putting some of your work in school publications. Building a base of work will help you to get your foot in the door and will hopefully get you recognized by publishers. Most poets don't make all that much money but there are occupations in which it will be very helpful. An advertising copywriter, for example, needs to be creative and be able to use explosive, provocative words in order to create an image, a mood, and a picture using only a few words. You may consider writing short stories that can be published in magazines, online, etc. The main thing to do is to develop your skill and create a portfolio of you work, and possibly get a degree or just take some classes so you can have a professional opinion on this matter. Good luck :-)
1o3OqSioaa	I like the first three lines, but it almost seems as if the last word in the last line (boil) was used just to rhyme with toil, because it really doesn't quite fit the stanza. Did you use the word toil just so that it would rhyme with boil?  Be careful of using words just so that they rhyme while losing the true meaning of your poem.  I hope you don't think that I'm being too harsh, I write poetry too, and I know that it is a very personal thing and I certainly don't want to discourage another poet. Like I said, I do really like the first three lines, just not fond of the "to boil" part.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	Sure sounds good poetically!

While opening a present, she accidentally paper cuts her finger, which causes Jasper (the newest 'vegetarian' with the least self-control) to snap and attempt to attack Bella because the scent of her blood is overwhelmingly yummy to him. This action finalized Edward's decision to keep Bella out of trouble (he did this out of love, but convinced Bella that he didn't love her anymore in order to let her let him go); by moving to Denali.

ARL4RYEaaa	You could write about how the Ingalls' faith guided their daily lives.|`|onkUcy19aa	Little House on the Prairie is a children's book by Laura Ingalls Wilder that was published in 1935. It is part of a series of books known collectively as the Little House series. The Little House series (also known as "Laura Years") is based on decades-old memories of Laura Ingalls Wilder's childhood in the Midwest region of the United States during the late 19th century. The best-known of the books is Little House on the Prairie. The books are told in the third person, with Laura Ingalls acting as the central character and protagonist, and are generally classified as historical fiction rather than as autobiography, although several of the later books are almost purely autobiographical. Wilder's daughter, author and political theorist Rose Wilder Lane, assisted her mother with the editing of the books. The depth of her involvement, and the extent of her influence on the theme and content of the books, has been the subject of some debate in recent years, but almost all Laura scholars and her biographers consider that the writing of the books was a tense but ultimately effective continuing collaboration between mother and daughter  Laura writing the books, Rose editing them. The books have remained continuously in print since their initial publication by Harper & Brothers, and are considered classics of American children's literature. Several of them were named Newbery Honor books. They remain widely read. The edition of the series currently in print contains illustrations by Garth Williams. The books were also adapted into a long running, popular American television series, Little House on the Prairie.|`|XMXlXu0xaa	What on Earth do you mean?

BjBkO0CSaa	Well he set a number of precedents during his time.    - Whiskey Rebellion: some people revolted against the tax placed on whiskey, Washington sent troops to break up the revolt, and set the precedent that anyone who wanted to change public policy (govt. laws) had to do saw lawfully [by amending/changing the law]    - Farewell Address: Washington's farewell address is one of the most famous of all farewell addresses; he made 2 major points: avoid political parties (it will break up the nation) - which wasn't followed, since Jefferson and Hamilton established opposing parties; and the other big thing was avoid international affairs all together - this one was pretty important [britain/france were in conflict during this time - napoleonic wars] and america stayed out of it as much as possible ] this was a policy that went on for several years until 1812 when british aggression brought on the War of 1812    -- 2 terms > as trivial as it may be, Washington set a HUGE precedent by leaving after 2 terms; when chosen, he was afraid that if he died in office, future presidents would think the job was for life (and it wasn't!) so when he left after serving 2 terms, that set a major precedent in future precedents > most early presidents served 2 terms (John Adams / John Quincy Adams did not) this legacy continued for over 150 years until FDR served for over 3 terms (which can be justified in its own right, due to World War II) but anyway, the 22nd amendment now limits presidents to 2 terms / 10 years in office [if the president dies, a VP can take his place, and still serve 2 terms]

EI4fmPnoaa	Start with your parents and work backward, by going up each generation until you get back to where ever they came from.    Starting with a family name and attempting to skip steps often can be misleading. In many cases, especially with folks of Slavic or Jewish ancestry, names were changed upon entry. I have a friend whose Jewish ancestors changed the family name from "Friedman" to "Franklin" at Ellis Island, because it sounded more "American." Another friend once told me that her Swedish ancestors did the same thing, but asked someone at the port of entry what would be a good "American-sounding" name, and was told "Israel," so now this entire family of tall, blonde-haired and blue-eyed kids has the last name of "Israel."    Many names were changed. On my mother's side, the last name can be spelled Stansfield, Standfield, Stanfield, Stanfill, and Stanphill. Literacy rates were fairly low in the U.S. until the 1840s, especially in the South and West. People who couldn't read and write were probably not terribly concerned with spelling their last names correctly.    Also, beware of false connections. Many European peasants took the last name of the estate where they had lived. Referring to the above, "Stansfield" is the name of a manor in Yorkshire. For one thing, a number of people over the centuries have held the title, "Earl of Stansfield," and without other information, it's hard to know which earl I'm related to. For another, the odds are much better that I'm related to one of the Stansfield peasants or villagers than that I'm related to one of the earls. There were a lot more commoners than earls.    The same goes for many Hispanic family names, as some converted their Nahuatl (the original Aztec language) to Spanish surnames, while more took the name of a prominent local figure.    All that being said, though, here's the Answers.com article on last names:|`|xncJ1uFmaa	Surely from your father and his ancestors. If you have any doubt, see your birth certificate.  If you just want to know the origin of the word rascoe as a name, go to web sites like wikipedia.

W8F9PboZaa	MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE    With a burning passion.  I'll post my generic anti-twilight post if you like :)      Ok Twilight is, I can honestly say the worst book I have ever read  Bella: I love you Edward  Edward: I love you too you are so beautiful  Bella: No YOU are so beautiful. I love you. You're all sparkly  Edward: You are the most perfect creature ever  1000 pages and 3 books later  Bella: I love you Edward  Edward: I love you you are so beautiful  Bella: No YOU are so beautiful. I love you. You're all sparkly and now we have a mutant child together HORRAY!  OMFG it's just them proliferating their love for each other for 1000+ pages. And right at the end Smeyer is like JESUS CHRIST I NEED PLOT and throws some crap in.    Ok Edward is not hot. He is a creepy stalker. he watches her sleep. He won't let her see her friends. He follows her around. He won't let her drive. He beats her up while they're having sex. He gives her a c-section with his teeth. Come on that's gross. Bella is disgusting, falling apart as soon as Edward leaves and only getting some semblance of togetherness back when she finds another guy to take Edward's place. PATHETIC.    It seems only tween girls with half a brain enjoy twilight. Every single one of my friends hates Twilight. Thinks it's absolutely ridiculous, the writing is terrible, the characters one dimensional and the plot cliche. We're 18. My sister, who is 13 is in love with Twilight. So are all her friends. They get together and talk about it and how 'awesome' it is and 'how much they love Edward' and how they 'just wish Jacob would die'. Basically Twilight is aimed for girls 12-16.     Smeyer writes likes she's swallowed a thesaurus and apparently doesn't know the meaning of Purple Prose. And she repeats the same phrases over and over and over again. Chagrin chagrin chagrin. STFU. Her books are riddled with plot holes and discrepancies. How can Edward, who has been dead for nearly 100 years, have sperm, which is alive, and has the capability to father a child. Yeah makes awesome sense.  And how can that child even exist. It's not scientifically possible for someone to have 23 chromosomes. It results in down syndrome. Obviously the stupid mormon doesn't believe in proven scientific fact. Or just doesn't research her books    Ok and every single character in Twilight is one dimensional.   Bella: Pathetic Mary Sue  Edward: I love you Bella. And the oldest virgin ever  Jacob: annoying.  And that's it. That's all the major characters. If you include like Emmett and Jasper and Alice. They don't even have personalities. Alice is just constantly jumping around "horray i just had a vision that we'll all live happily ever after".The best one, in my opinion is Rosalie. Or Jasper. In that movie he looked constipated the entire time. Did he even say anything?    I hate the way Bella is supposed to be an average girl, with faults. As far as I can tell her only fault is being "clumsy" which everyone seems to find endearing so isn't really a fault at all. And what's with her supposed to be average looking? yeah ok coz it's not like every guy in the school wants to be in her pants apparently. At my high school all the guys went for the average girl, definitely. She looks basically the same as Stephenie meyer would look. Except 50kg lighter. Lol at her photoshopping her fatness away.  But this girl is supposed to be a role model. She completely falls apart when Edward leaves her and only pulls herself back together when she's found another man to replace him. It's pathetic. She has no independence or goals. She just wants to be with Edward forever, regardless of the consequences to herself and everyone around her.     And EDWARD. Apparently the man of every girls dreams? Why because he's pretty. Hey maybe it's just me but I'd be a bit freaked out if my boyfriend started to sparkle. I love the fact that he hasn't got chisseled abs. I've grown up learning that you love a person for who they are, not what they look like. Yet in relation to love, the only thing that Bella ever describes is Edward's looks. Great example for all the kids out there. You look at his personality and you realise he's a stalker. He follows her around, watches her sleep, won't let her see her friends, won't let her drive. He controls her completely and people find this romantic! During sex he beats her black and blue and again, his regret is seen as romantic. He gives her a c-section with his teeth and again, oh so romantic, I would swoon if this happened to me.    Stephen King, best selling author for decades said on Twilight and its comparison to Harry Potter:   "The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn," he said. "She's not very good."|`|usvPMtMtaa	i hate it so much i made an account solely to rip into these stupid twilight b*tches|`|XMXlXu0xaa	Is this question even worth typing, like seriously ? Go find some sort of a life so real questions can be asked on Yahoo Answers. Thanks !|`|phH2dVYZaa	Y-heh!!!    Edward: Listen to your heart fly; it's fluttering like a hummingbird's wings.  Bella: I love you Edward, as I am so perfect but have a contrived sense of humility. Edward your beauty is god-like, your voice is like an angel's, and it doesn't matter if I'm blaspheming since I have the characteristics of a 30-year-old mormon mother; I love you.  Edward: I love you more, Bella, more than you know! But I am dangerous; you should stay away from me  Bella: No, I love you!  Edward: I'm dangerous. Stay away.  Bella: You're so hot. Sex me.  Edward: I'm too dangerous...I'd rather string you along so I can pash you for a while to satisfy my 108-year-old virgin needs...then I can do you when we're married so as not to upset no one, and cover you in bruises which you think is so romantic  Jacob: [sexually harasses]  Bella: Oh...I love you Jacob, too!  Edward: Whatever makes you happy.  Jacob: Oh, I'm in love you with your 2 year old, though I'll wait till she's 7 before I shag her.  Edward, Bella, Jacob, fangirls: YAYY!!!      >End scene|`|wCjjBdzUaa	don't drink the hate-or-ade    just because you dislike something,  It doesn't mean you should go and post negative things about it.|`|MMmv06Ynaa	just let people who love twilight, love twilight. how does it affect your personal life anyway. honestly u are acting like a 5 year old.|`|XFb80uFLaa	I actually happen to like the books.

I hate them, and as a result, I've ended up hating the book.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Maybe I lack passion but I don't feel that strongly one way or another towards it.

Feel free to send me hatemail.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Yeah exactly! I'm so embarrassed by myself. I used to have a picture of Robert Pattinson in my room. I read the books numerous times. Which actually comes in handy in my hating as I know the books well enough to give good examples and actually know what I'm talking about.    But yeah one day it was like I had a revelation. I leant it to my boyfriend to read and he was like... wtf that was crap. And I was like... omg it was. It was amazing for me. And since i have been a Twilight hater. I reread and couldn't see what I saw in it. The writing is crap, the characters are crap, the plot is crap. Basically it's just crap    However now i have to deal with some of my friends who think I still like it and make references to it. It's embarrassing for me|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Yeah.    Once upon a time, an innocent girl saw the weirdish cover, and with recommendations from friends, read it. She adored it and wished for such *love* with Edward. [Side note: this is a painful memory. I'm so ashamed, lol]    Then, she read the next book. She was enthralled and was annoyed at Jacob, but wasn't quite so idiotic as to cry when Edward left. Bella had begun to annoy her.    She read the next book. This was when the doubt began. All the characters became annoying. The plot was frazzled and un-centered. The word chioce was horrid and the grammar was depressing. However, the girl believed that the author had probably hit a snag and was under too much pressure. She still had faith.    She then read the last book to the series. She grew increasingly horrified as she turned the pages, wondering how SM managed to so thoroughly rape the characters and then run over them with cars. And then.....              BAM!!!!! A REVELATION!!!    They'd always been this way, but it took truly horrific writing to really see the light! These books were horrible. Horrible, horrible.     The girl, saddened, tried to convince herself that it was only the last book that sucked. That the others were still epic awesome literature!!    She was wrong. She tried to read the first one, but became increasingly disgusted with the writing, the characters, and the idiotic obsession with a dead person.     And here she is now, ragging on Twilight with a fiery passion.    [She believes she has increased in intelligence.]    lol, that was kinda fun. =]|`|AA12095466	omg i wat to throw things that the fangirls too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but i loove the books, everyone is just soo obssessed with it becuz of robert patterson i mean personally he isnt that hot.|`|ASwTNY89aa	YES YES YES! me too. I feel like "did i look that stupid?" haha|`|DMjxbn3Jaa	I still like it...|`|AyWaKdtmaa	I used to love it passionately, then all the fangirls annoyed me, so I hated it. Except then my friend begged me to read the series AGAIN but I said no, but she wouldn't leave me alone so I did and now I love it again, and keep reading the books so I wont start hating it again. Its confusing.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yep.  I used to be obsessed with it, but now realise why!?    Seriously, though, the fangirls stuffed it up.|`|N0YH5RRuaa	No.|`|AA11271703	Hahaha. Yeah!    When I read the book I was pretty much fine with it (except that I never did like Edward). But then after that it got so hyped up and everything I got sick of it and found it WAY overrated.

usvPMtMtaa	lol you missed some    1. Twenty three chromosomes and twenty five chromosomes DO NOT make twenty four. It is completely impossible for Bella to have conceived Nessie. Protein is a component of DNA, which is obviously in sperm; Edward has no need for proteins, and his body should not contain any. So what function does his having DNA serve? And why would vampires need to keep the ability to create sperm anyways? Sperm are LIVING CELLS. They have to be replaced. Edward is DEAD. Dead guys cannot reproduce, especially when their partner has a different amount of chromosomes. Not to mention that it is completely impossible for a human to carry a baby to term in one month. A human body must go through MONTHS of change to support the baby; hormones, anyone? Bella's body would have rejected the fetus. I'm also having a really hard time believing changing into a vamp can actually change your chromosome count, but that's just me.    2. Twenty three chromosomes and twenty four sure as hell does not create a viable baby. Wolves have 24 chromosomes, right? And the purpose of imprinting is to pass on the gene, right? Claire, Kim, and Emily are all *human* women. They have *human* bodies. If you mix 23 chromosomes with 24, you are NOT going to get a viable offspring, which completely negates the purpose of imprinting ("passing on the gene"). Just look at Downs Syndrome-- that's a disease caused if the chromosomes are off. If an organism has parents with differing amounts of chromosomes, 999/1000 times, it's not going to be viable (which means Nessie should probably be sterile). If you mix 23 and 24, the offspring would end up deformed, sterile, or dead. Chromosome issues can cause severe physical problems.    3. Jake's "best genetic match" to "pass along the werewolf gene" is a half vampire hybrid? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. So his MORTAL ENEMY is going to pass along the gene? Uh huh. Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. I can totally believe that one. *Rolls eyes*    4. Let me get this straight-- Carlisle is so insatiable curious that he's taken the time to check out Jake's DNA, without Jake's permission, yet he's never taken the time to check out his own sperm? This is CARLISLE we are talking about here. Don't you think he would have done EVERYTHING he could have done to find out a vampire's body, especially since Esme wants children so badly?    5. Alice saw the Volturi clash, even though Jake was involved? What happened to not being able to "see" the werewolves (excuse me, shapeshifters, since Smeyer decided to change the name of the wolves for no apparent reason other than plot filler and to confuse her fans in the last book).    6. Edward is careful about kissing Bella so that the venom won't get in her mouth... yet she got impregnated by venom? What the hell? Don't you think the sperm would have caused a bit of... well... damage to the Land Down Under if KISSING would have transformed her?! How can she get pregnant from VENOM?!    7. Jasper has a hard time being around humans... so he goes to high school? Why? He could hide easily enough and get out of temptation's way; what's the point of having them go to High School?|`|REfldr5Iaa	people probably thought that it was the car that made that dent instead of Edward.     It's a question that i have wondered about too|`|TDp3H7i4aa	They thought that it was Bella's head, or the truck that made the dent.  Honestly, don't be stupid, and hate on the book, if you actually haven't read it good.|`|sfnRrAAmaa	(I love your name)    He tries to flatten it out, and emmett mentally thinks something like ' ill clear up anything you missed'    so no one would see the dent.    unless you are talking bout the movie|`|CeKNuNliaa	Pointing out random plotholes, while entertaining to find ill do nothing.    Twilight haters will use it to justify why Twilight sucks.    Twilight lovers might go, "Yeah, but the book is entertaining."    Twihards will scream, "OMG! STEPAHIE IS AN AWESOME WRITER! I LOVE EDWARD CULLEN! SHUT UP!"|`|qIqelPE3aa	no one noticed Edward stopped the van, they dont see the dent as it is an old van, so it could have been from an accident by billy black|`|sekPmSIqaa	In the book, no one noticed Edward stopping the car becuase he moved so fast, then he flattened out the dent before people came over.He also stayed there. The kid that hit Bella might have noticed something was odd, but in the rush of adrenaline he probably dismissed it.     The movie kind of did a poopy job of he scene because not only did he not fix the dent as he did in the book, he left leaving the huge dent. I remember seeings that and laughing really loud at the ridiculousness of it.|`|phH2dVYZaa	And, if everyone started converging on them after the crash, wouldn't the people SEE EDWARD? Especially in the movie since he jumped off the car or whatever.    Twilight has SO many plotholes, but if you point one out you automatically have no life, are too obsessed with HP or you are totally gay/lame/need to get a social life.|`|dHjjLozcaa	I can understand why you would consider this a plothole.  In Midnight Sun (Twilight in Edward's point of view, also written by Stephenie Meyer) it says that when the no on was looking and the EMTs were taking care of Bella, putting the neck brace on her, Edward was able to quietly rearrange the shape of the dent in the car with his foot, and Emmett promised him to take care of anything else that Edward may have missed. That's one of the reasons why I loved reading Midnight Sun, its like you get to know every detail possible about Twilight. I just hope Stephenie Meyer decides to finish and publish it.    Stephenie Meyer was finished with 12 chapters of Midnight Sun when it was illegally leaked on to the internet. It's currently "on hold indefinitely". She has posted the first 264 pages on her website for her fans to read.    If you'd like to read it, here's the link: http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/pdf/midnig... And if you'd just like to read the part about the dent in the car, it's on page 63.    Hope this helped. And yes, the insults were completely uncalled for.    megan|`|pAih5juAaa	There's a line in Buffy, where something bad has gone done like a vampire attack, and everyone blocks it out.

From memory things like he wasn't seen, people didn't take notice and the family hid it well enough.  Well enough they were more worried about Bella spilling rather than people seeing...|`|0gVuMgeMaa	well it hit the truck at the back as well  and he smoothed out the dent with his hand afterwards before anyone could notice  so the people around just figure the truck hit the back of her truck and stopped before it hit her as well|`|XZBJNwi1aa	Most of the people in Twilight are pretty dense, so its believable that they would miss it.

I think why people didn't notice, is because they where so shocked, and by the time they could have maybe the Cullen family did something with the car. They also could have though the car just stooped when Edward put his hand out, maybe they didn't even notice his hand. And plus right after he left, and you do have to remember he is super fast, like the flash, so maybe they didn't see him.|`|AyWaKdtmaa	Well no one saw Edward stop the van cuz it was in the way of their view. But I always have wondered subcontiously until now how people could not notice the dent. But for people who are throwing a fit over the sperm and chromosomes crap, for goodness sake, its fiction!!!|`|vzU7uuvRaa	I agree entirely with ALEX.    EDIT: and Idiot on Yahoo hates Twilight|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I thought nobody saw him because he's so fast. I thought that was even mentioned in the book itself. I also thought, that people thought Bella got hit. That's why she was on the floor. They didn't know she was feeling faint from what had just happened. They were suprised she didn't have marks on her too. I don't know what happened in the movie, but in the book the dent wasn't the major deal. The fact she didn't die was the major deal. The major deal to her, was that Edward was so fast, it was one of the first times she noticed he was different.|`|MZagCrTSaa	What really gets me going is the fact that Edward has to skip bio over a few measly finger pricks, but when Bella is almost smushed by that van, he's sitting in the hospital with her and Tyler is in the bed next to them bleeding all over the place.     So a finger prick is deadly...  A paper cut is deadly, but a guy sitting right near you covered in blood...  It's all sweet!|`|W8F9PboZaa	The entire book is just one gaping plot hole. Add this into it, it's like a black hole, just keeps getting bigger and bigger.    And yeah I agree with you. But no one would notice of course, because in Twilight everything goes exactly how Smeyer wants it even if it means massacring logic and reason on the way|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I thought of that when I read it and then again when I saw the movie.    I just couldn't believe that noone noticed that Bella was there and there was a human shaped dent in his car but no one questioned it.    Maybe everyone in Forks is really stupid and that's why noone said anything.
ceBTTCPwaa	Pride and Prejudice, first published on 28 January 1813, is one of Jane Austen's novels, and is her second published novel.

Not to mention it is people who gave such events the title of "History". In conclusion, people "make" history.|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	today is history tomorrow

Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|1Z13L9h2aa	Our pupils.

Even if there is no physical proof of such a being, as long as people have the belief and imagination to create one then a god will exhist.  What shape this divinity appears in I think is dependent on the one doing the believing.    Edit: fubarboarder I can see what you're saying but I think you're missing the point i'm making. I was raised in a christian household with my grandmother who strongly believes that there is one God and that he is the alpha and omega. No argument I could present to her would change her mind, therefore no-matter what I said, God would always exist for her whether or not she is actually correct. That is a view that many christians have.  My mother personally believes that there is one God as well, however she believes that God takes a female form, that's what she firmly believes in her mind and she won't be persuaded otherwise either.  Now me, i'm not a religious person, deities from different cultures around the world fasinate me, but I have no firm belief that any one deity or group of deities are real.  I could say there is no god, but does that make me right?    I'm not saying whether or not a belief is right or wrong but at the end of the day if a person truly believes something then at least in their own minds it is real. Therefore a god will always be real so long as a person has the belief and imagination to make the god real. Don't take my words at a literal sense, the difference between imagination and reality is quite vast. Maybe there is an all powerful God watching his creations from heaven. Maybe there are a group of gods and goddesses sitting on Mt Olympus somewhere. Who knows right? What i'm discussing merely refers to the spiritual belief that each person has as an individual.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Yes, God is real.  God comes in every shape and form...especially the ones you don't want to recognize.  What people think God is, mainly is what they have been taught by others who are equally ignorant.  Don't be expecting because only rarely does God do that one - for that which you pursue flees from you, you cannot have what you "want," and demanding God in only certain narrow ways leaves you without any experience of God at all.    How many shapes does God take?  How many grains of sand are there on every beach and desert in the world?  How many forms does God take?  How many forms are there in the clouds you see in the sky every day?  In order to witness God, you have to open your mind WIDE OPEN and look everywhere, including inside YOURSELF.  Especially, inside yourself!    If you want to "see" God, all you have to do is look.  If you want to hear God, then all you have to do is use your ears.  And if you want to taste God, all you have to do is use your tongue.  And if you want to feel God, all you have to do is use your hands.    For what would you think if I told you - God is ALL OF IT?  I mean, God is everywhere, in all things, and IS all things?      The fact is, you have been experiencing God all along and did not know it - having thought mistakenly as so many do, that God is only some VERY NARROW thing when God is much bigger than that - much MUCH bigger.    So while you are waiting around in order to have the experience that God is being something in particular, you are totally ignoring God being everywhere that you are not recognizing as God.      The answer is to see God everywhere, in all things, in every person, animal, rock, stone, mountain, cloud, star, planet, sun, galaxy - its all God.  And I am reminding you of it now because you wanted to be reminded - you would not be asking the question if you were not ready to receive the answer.    Yes, God is intellect and spirit, and Being - but God is being something much more than just those things - God is the Process of Life and that is what is going on all around you, isn't it?  And in you, and me and everyone else too.    That is why the golden rule says, "Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself."  For when you do it to another, you do it to YOU.  When I give you this knowledge, I am giving knowledge to myself.  When I give you knowledge of God, then I open the door to giving myself even more knowledge about God than I have now.  So of course I want to help you to understand and see the truth - simply because I want to help myself understand and see.      It sort of works like this - if you start the snowball rolling, things come back to you.  Always remember that.      And don't make the mistake that you think this was somehow flippant or maybe just chance encounter - nothing in God's universe ever happens without a purpose or reason.|`|suTye2m2aa	He just Is.       :)|`|9z5NASypaa	My god comes in the form and shape of David Beckham, he is david Beckham! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|`|Pq48dNPUaa	I think think there is a god, who knows what form or shape he may be in, but I believe if it weren't for god, then my life wouldn't be in as good shape as it is.|`|4maV4O1aaa	Nope, not really.|`|XXc15qzzaa	The Bible says God made man in His image.

Once a person visit him for a hair cut, and the Barber started to have a debate with him as there is no God. If god is there why there is so much pain, poverty and wars in the world. why don't he stop it all. The man started to get angry and leave the place after getting his hair cut without saying anything. After comes out he saw a beggar on the road with a long beard and untidy hair full of dust. The man go back to the Barber and tell him "you know what Barber doesn't exist". The Barber with a strange expression ask him how you can say this. I do exist, i am in front of you and just now gave you a hair cut. To this the man reply, if Barber exist why there are people with untidy hair and long beard in the world. The Barber reply: it not my fault they don't come to me for a hair cut. To this again the man reply" Exactly the people don't go to god with their problems, but this doesn't mean he does not exist".    I hope this will satisfy your question.

Or "Repatriare" would be cool since it's latin for repatriation which would generally has a negative connotation but if you think of it like he was being 'repatrioted' (not a real word :) ) to a NEW homeland it's really beautiful|`|nE9BaUWIaa	The Boat of Life.|`|QmWNwHb5aa	Well thing is if its meaningful it shouldnt be something generic like 'boat people' or 'vietnam' for this type of story, if there is any specific story he told you that means more than any other - quote it as the title. If theres something in it more inspirational than anything else - use that. Do something thats meaningful and powerful.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Memoirs of a Vietnamese Sailor

AA12342921	As a former dancer and the mom of a dancer who just started on pointe, I think I would strongly advise talking to a sports therapist - a physical therapist that specializes in athletes.    You are going to be in a cast for six long weeks, and your body will lose mucsle tone. As a dancer, you know which excercises will demand the most from your leg.  Grand Plies, and doing toe stretching while hanging on the bar may actually be too much for a month or so.    Again, Ballet is one of the most intense full body work outs known, and the body needs to be in good shape for upper level Ballet, which is what it sounds like you are in.   Ask your doctor for a ref to a good sports therapist - they understand the stress that full time workouts demand and what your leg can and can't handle. Also, work out a modified bar routine - your teacher should be able to help with that, so that you can gain back balance and muscle tone.    Sorry to hear about your injury Twinkletoes - but next time, don't really BREAK a Leg !

Piggy wants to go to Jack and the others and insist that they give his glasses back, because it's the right and reasonable thing to do.    ? Ralph, doubtful, agrees to give it a try.    ? They pair decides to bring the conch shell with them to give an impression of authority. (Yes, that will work, too.)    ? Ralph thinks they should clean up ahead of time, too, by taking a bath and combing their hair.    ? Ralph starts yelling about smoke and, anticipating his confusion, Piggy gently tells him that the smoke is so they can be rescued.    ? Ralph flips out - he says he knew that and doesn't need to be told. Piggy nods, patronizing his poor friend.    ?

6yZ7uABzaa	you can't legally get music for free online. However, you could look in your local music library for "Clarinet Jazz Studies" by James Rae. They're all really good, esp Windy Ridge :)  There's also a good book if you're more of an advanced player. It's 80 studies for clarinet, and it's by a variety of composers. It's in 2 halves though... i did 3 of these for grade 6-8 on my clarinet - they're lovely!|`|AA11075358	No such thing sorry! there is lots of bucks in sheet music publishing. I would ask clarinet teacher for advice. They know your playing and your abilities, strengths weaknesses. They usually have pretty good music libraries that you can raid too!|`|nSXos2tIaa	I don't think you can get "free" clarinet solos, but I would recommend some good solos.     1. Carl Stamitz Konzert Nr. 3   2. Concerto In Eb by Franz Krommer  3. Clarinet Concerito in A major k.622 by Mozart    I played all of these solos, and they we were good solos :)

vJfcepDOaa	I think it's good, although there are a couple of things you can tighten up here and there. Unlike the previous answerer, I thought the Antiques Roadshow (note: it's not Antique Roadshows, as you've written) part was funny. Australian humour is typically self-deprecating, after all.    Some edits I'd make are these:  Paragraph One:  * Unless you have to say so, cut 'Good afternoon...Mrs Buick' down to just 'Good afternoon' or even 'Hello'. I'd also cut out the next sentence, 'I'm here today...about myself' because I'm assuming everyone already knows why you're there and what you're doing.    * I'd follow with something like, "I found choosing a funny story really hard/difficult because my life can be about as entertaining as an Antiques Roadshow marathon, but I hope you enjoy this tale of my humiliation."    Paragraph Two:  * I'd say something like "Four years ago, I lived in New South Wales and attended Grafton Public School. Every month the school would host a huge disco, and this particular incident happened at the last disco I went to before we moved. I asked my dad to pick me up at the end, then thought nothing more of him as I went to the disco and had a great time.    Paragraph Three:  * "At the end of the night, we lined up along the fence waiting for our parents as usual. I searched the crowd for my dad - and there he was! I groaned inwardly at the...um...interesting outfit he'd chosen to wear. In public. In front of all my friends. He was wearing ugg boots teamed with his daggiest pyjamas - the ones covered with pictures of dogs - and was obviously channelling Grandpa Highpants, because they were pulled up past his bellybutton. I looked away as Dad came closer, hoping that if I didn't draw attention to him, then maybe no-one else would notice the escapee from the lunatic asylum. When the teacher asked if I could see my dad yet, I pointed vaguely at a group of more suitably attired parents.    Paragraph Four:  * "I might have gotten away with it, if Dad hadn't suddenly yelled my name loudly enough for the whole school to hear. I ignored him, hoping he'd get the psychic messages I was sending him, pleading with him to have mercy or else I'd be the first person I'd ever heard of to die of embarrassment. Unfortunately, Dad wasn't psychically attuned, and instead of piping down he actually came closer, and started waving his arms around to get my attention! By now, the whole school was eyeing the strangely dressed crazy man who was yelling my name and gesticulating wildly. I gave up, and admitted to the teacher that yes, THAT man was my father.    In the car, when I accused him of being the most embarrassing father in the world, he just looked at me, smiled, and shook his head.    "Dads like me don't grow on trees, you know."    And he was probably right. They usually swing beneath them!    Thanks for listening."    Of course, these are just my suggestions, and you're free to adopt them or not as you see fit. I find hyperbole (exaggeration) quite effective in humourous stories, and performance will also help, too. Practice it beforehand, putting feeling and emphasis into your presentation. Try some actions: roll your eyes, sigh dramatically, cringe, wave your arms around like your dad at the appropriate points.    Good luck :-)|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Psh... I like Antiques Roadshow and a marathon would be awesome... :-P  But that line in your speech kind of makes you seem like you're trying to feel sorry for you for having a boring life.    I'm not saying you have a boring life. You probably have a really exciting one. I've been to Grafton. I ate in their McDonalds. It was awesome.|`|W8F9PboZaa	oral is never good if it's short.    lol. umm yeah I like it. I didn't laugh. Because someone has to do something pretty darn funny for me to laugh.  I had to do an assignment similar to this in year 11. I wrote about getting sunburnt so bad my face swelled up over my eyes and I had to go to hospital. I had the class rolling and i had no idea how, I was hoping for a chuckle.     But yeah nice speech, I especially like the end, with fathers swinging beneath the tree. Your teacher will love that.    And horray for Grafton! We used to drive through there on the way to see our family. I know hardcore relation there. And antique roadshow is so awesome. omg i'm such a noob|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	Though it's not bad, instead of saying 'I have chosen the following because my life stories are about as entertaining as an Antique Roadshows marathon so I found choosing a funny story really hard!' you can say something in sarcasm. For example 'Because of all of my wondrous stories I have stacked up, it was pretty tough to choose one.' This way, you're not really saying 'I don't have entertaining stories' but it's implied.    I think the story itself is good!  But I didn't laugh as much as you probably wanted. I feel bad when people are embarrassed by their parents. They're usually the ones who love you most and you should  stick up for them and never be ashamed.    I'm sure barely anyone feels how I do, so they'll probably think it's real funny!    If you're reading this off of noted cards, make sure you look up a lot. Also, make sure you use appropriate facial expressions that go well with the different parts.    Good luck :D
AA11526235	It wasn't so much that he wanted to get rid of indulgences, but that he objected to selling them.  He also objected to the tactics used in the selling of them.  He noted that the money was going from poor people who could ill-afford the cost to the pope's treasury which was paying for a cathedral which would glorify the pope.  It would not benefit anyone else.  After all, how many cathedrals were needed and at what price to the poor?  The tactics of the salespeople were rather shoddy--laying guilt on them for the fate of their relatives' souls if they didn't buy indulgences.
VlcMlYGwaa	i say movement because back in the 60s people wanted more diversity in what they were listening, so they created rock and roll!!!|`|QXQWDw1qaa	It was BOTH a development AND a movement.  When I first started playing the piano, it was 1946 and the music was all the melodic, story telling music of the War times... By the time I took up the guitar and started my first band, the music had developed into a faster, rhythm based music with a 'dance' beat.. but it was still simple and told stories..     In the 1950's Rock and Roll and Folk Music were BOTH Movements... and sometimes the same musicians played both genres.    Music has ALWAYS been a DEVELOPMENT.. from 40,000 years ago when a caveman blew into the hollow tibia of an animal leg all the way to that abomination called "Hip-Hop" or (C)RAP.|`|WoEsehoRaa	A genre.|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	I'd say a development or a movement because it happened over time and was an adaptation of other styles, and because it's not a physical thing. But by definition it could be called an invention too.|`|LoKJBLF1aa	yes, it developed from rhythm and blues.

jpTl3o5naa	Yes it is still a mans world and the public made it that way. We are coming along with women appointments to government and high positions, but still have a long way to go. Most times women are not respected enough and are looked at differently than men. I have seen it many times where women in car dealerships, stores, mechanics, etc, are catered to better. The pay needs to be adjusted and go according to the persons skills and background, not their gender. I  don't sit back and take it but many have to, especially in bad economic times. It is assumed that the man is always the bread winner and not the woman, when some are. I. for one, won't tolerate sexual advances that are unwanted and still it goes on. I tell them like it is and handle that one. When I had a car repair, they always assume that a man knows more than a woman and take advantage of that. Many men don't know about cars either but are treated better and more fairly. We have a long way to go.|`|cuIX13BKaa	It is just a world and we live in it.

7VpDEkC6aa	That was a good one ,Bert   LOL    Anyway to answer your question....  (BTW,   CBGB's  WAS a club in New York where a lot of punk Rock band got their start.  The Ramones and Blondie are two big names that started out there.)    There hasn't been anyone who played with poop onstage. However, I believe the artist you are thinking off was Iggy Pop and the Stooges.   What he was actually doing was playing with peanut butter. I can't remember exactly how he got the peanut butter....maybe someone threw the jar of it at him......In any case what he was doing was scooping up big gobs of it and throwing it into the crowd and smearing it all over his body.       The brown color and consistency made observers think that he was using doo-doo.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD_XCECbA...  Here is the video the incident.    I had also heard "tales" about Frank Zappa doing something like rolling little balls of poop onstage, before I really knew who he was, but I'm pretty sure that is untrue, as I'm a big Zappa fan and don't recall ever seeing anything about it.    But Iggy is definitely the one you were thinking of.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I've heard Marilyn Manson used to,  among other things...

Only the fey magic which runs through his veins has enabled Colin to find what others cannot; the Tanglewood, the 'wood within the woods.     Full of odd characters and creatures of the fey, the Tanglewood is a world of magnificent folklore come to life. As Colin begins to explore the Tanglewood, he will find friendship with the ferrish Ailfrid, the elfin girl Deidre, and Doc Muffingrow, a wise druid.     Colin will also find that there is much magic in himself, as well as dangerous enemies who will not let him find solace in the wood so easily. Ailil, King of the Sprites and ruler of The Below, has laid claim to his spirit, and Colin will need the help of his friends and quite a bit of magic to save himself.     The Tanglewood is a place like no other, and Colin is a boy like no other.

But I totally adore her Science Fiction, too. Absolutely great stuff for when you graduate from Mercedes Lackey (who I used to love to bits).    Then there's Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series -- especially the ones that feature the witches. Just a hoot! It's fantasy, but it's mostly pointed social commentary on our times. Too funny!    On the milder side of things, there's the Betsy, Queen of the Vampire series, by Mary Janice Davidson. The queen of the vampires has a shoe fetish . . . starts with Undead and Unwed, I think.    Shanna Swendson also has a great series about a Texan girl who goes to New York, falls in love with a wizard, and finds her own specialness in the secret world of magic (starts with Enchanted, Inc).     Ursula Le Guin is good. Howl's Moving Castle by Dianna Wynne Jones is fantastic! (both book and movie -- although these are two separate works of art).     There's Narnia. A Wrinkle in Time. The Hobbit. The Once and Future King.     If you like humor, the Late Robert Aspirin had the very great Myth series.

I know that they aren't new and everyone knows about them but for me, they're pretty tough to top. I read the first one when I was ten years old and I've grown up with them, you know what I mean? They were a pretty big part of my childhood. I always got really wrapped up in each one and I've read them all at least ten times.   They only get better as they go, and 3-7 are all spectacular.

W8F9PboZaa	Ok right so at the moment there are more haters then lovers. You came here a month ago and you would be inundated with questions of "EDWARD OR JACOB?!!" and "Do u reali think i culd marry edward cullen?" Do you have any idea how irritating that is. The only reason us haters exist is to combat the crazies    If you look at the series from a literary standpoint you realise just how poorly written it is. I cannot believe that such an appallingly written book is so popular. I initially liked the series and it was from looking at the critical analysis of others HERE that i realized just how bad it was. I'm hoping to enlighten others :)    Also I think they're a terrible example for younger kids, particularly girls. Bella is supposed to be a role model. She's shallow, one dimensional and her life revolves entirely around her boyfriend. When he leaves she falls apart and only pulls herself together when she finds another guy to take his place. She has no goals and her aim in life is to be with Edward forever. Not exactly the best role model huh?    And Edward. This guy is supposed to be the 'perfect guy'. I grew up learning to love a person for who they are, not what they look like. Edward and Bella's relationship is based solely on looks. All they do is describe how beautiful the other is. This is how girls are growing up to see how relationships are supposed to be. No. I think that's terrible.      And I never ask questions bashing Twilight. I answer them. And I answer pro-Twilight questions too. Simply because i like discussing my hate with other haters, and I like expressing my opinion. That's it. But I'm definitely not against the anti-Twilighters asking the questions. Most of them are really witty. And because we actually are literate and can use the searchbar most of them are original and hilarious. The others I just post my generic anti-twilight post to lol|`|FF9mMlgKaa	I do it to create an equal mass of Twilight troll questions as there are Twilight fan questions to create an annoyance that parallels that of my own when I can't find some actual interesting questions in the Books and Authors section. I also hate to see people all doing the same thing.|`|phH2dVYZaa	Category: Hater  Reply: Because it's hilarious to listen to the crazy fans and twilightsucks.com is hilarious also. Also I obsess about something I don't like in phases; I research them and then debate. I like debates. I am an avid reader and Harry Potter is responsible for the literacy of our generation, and Twilight is responsible for destroying.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Disliker.    Most of the haters are anti-fan, not anti book, simply because the fans are so annoying. I myself think the books are poorly written and the fans are overboard, but I try not to attack people, just the book.   Why is it a waste of time? If someone said "I think you should die because The Purple Egg Creature said so" would it then be a waste of time trying to correct them? Why do atheists and Christians keep debating? Same principle.|`|REfldr5Iaa	I really don't know why i've gotten so obsessed over the books... I think for most people, it's because they wish they were in love like Bella and Edward... Even though Bella's true love is a vampire, at least she's in love someone... I think when someone reads these books, they imagine themselves as Bella, so of course they fall in love with the books. Many people are in a rush to fall in love, and when you find a book that gives you that feeling, you start to obsess over it...    It's talked about a lot because it's been so successful. These books got generations actually reading!!|`|kHR47Vjyaa	I agree with you both ways :)  I am a TwiHard but some girls can get stalker-like.  Why are the obsessed with hating: b/c they want to be against the flow of the world. Because they think rebelling is "cool"  Why are they obsessed with the books? Because Bella and Edward's love is one of the ONLY true love stories out there in a world full of body image and perfection. Everyone is Bella in their own way, we're clumsy, plain, uninteresting and boring (well, at least we think we are) and doesn't everyone want to know that the most perfect guy can fall in love with plain, little ol' you? It's just a play on one of the most common fantasies :)  Bonus question: for the reasons above :) And b/c of how amazing the movie was :D|`|MBjgsoPwaa	I am completley obsessed with this book, so I guess I answer the lover question.     Um...I am obsessed with it because its has an amazing storyline and it is such a page turner. (well to me at least). It recreates a more modern version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Its' a beautiful love story. The best part of it, is that you fee like you are Bella. You feel like you are excperiencing the her life while you read the book. And lastly, of course, Edward. Every girl wishes for the perfect man. and Edward is just that.     The reason why I think so manny people hate the book, some people think that people are making such a big deal out of just a book. Others think that Stephanie Meyer is not a good writer (too repetitive or whatever). Or they just hate the actors that play their parts.     I can't understand why they hate it so much, but that is just what I have heard.     Hope it helps!|`|WATlJNKvaa	ok we're not obsessed if you wanna see obssesed look at twilight lovers they are obsessed. well i don't know about other haters but part of my hate for twilight comes from the people reading it where i live. they treat it like tha bible (not literally). i mean isn't that takeing it a bit far? they always carry the books in their hands as if parading and also some online have even made joke that the twilight series is the bible in 5 volumes. a joke right? but not a very good one. to finish it all off there alot of better books that never had so much fame and why? because most people don't read twilight for the book but for edward.    ok i got carried away. lols. byes. =)|`|Jnv47zQgaa	one reason why people are so obsessed with the story is because it is a romance, every girl wants to find her 'perfect'-in her eyes- guy. They are impatient to fall in love and when you read these books you feel like you are living in the life of Bella. its like your in her shoes.    the haters, the haters are mainly so harsh because of the extreme fan base and how obsessive they are. if there weren't so many EDWARD V'S JACOB or WHAT DO U THINK OF TWILIGHT things floating around there wouldn't be so much criticism. or for the fact that no one is perfect and so many people are obsessed with edward and not twilight its self and when you ask them why they say 'BECAUSE HE IS PERFECT' and no person is or ever will be perfect    and the bonus question well i guess because people love it and people love to hate it, either way people are talking about it because they are saying its great or horrible.     things get criticism,    i am a fan but i also see why haters are so fed up with everything about twilight. yes i would say im obsessed but i am not showing it and frustrating everyone else off in the process.     and it is a book and one that has gotten many people reading, and i think that people should see that, but also keep their opinions to them self and this includes fans and haters|`|r68xD4JFaa	Because we hate you, not the books  You fangirls have ruined Books & Authors by reporting anyone who disagrees with you, till yahoo's software bounces the account. Your crowd and the Harry Potter crowd shouldn't be here.  You should be at the equivalent of the yahoo kiddie table.   You rarely ask worthwhile questions, because you're looking for a fan club, not actual answers or even opinions.     I can point to a half dozen regular posters that have been bounced, without even trying hard.  Soon, only the cut-n-pasters and the Twilight fans will be left.  Then who'll bother telling people their fan fiction sucks?                    Report Twilight Question askers for a better tomorrow.      Simply do what the Twits have been doing, report every criticism till yahoo's arbitrary software system bounces their account. Otherwise the books and authors section will soon only have twilight appeasers as top answerers.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	As a writer, I find it useful to consider why some books don't work for me. It helps me to write better. It's much more difficult to try to take a book where everything _does_ work - because I end up copying. But with Twilight, I can think "I don't like this because..." and make an effort not to do it.    Why is this book so talked about? Because its target audience (teen girls) is probably the most active on internet forums.
1OjZoHlkaa	Another Stephen King fan here too!    I also like John Saul who writes great books usually horror type involving teens.    Have you tried Joe Hill (SK's son) Heart shapped Box and 20th Century Ghosts - both great reads.    B & A can be horrid, just skip the twilight type questions!  You can find some great questions if you keep going!|`|REfldr5Iaa	Stephenie Meyer   She wrote the Twilight Saga, which i'm pretty much obsessed with... She's an amazing writer!!!    About the hate Q's:   It's mainly made by people who hate the Twilight books, because they have no life, and want to get Twilight fans annoyed when they and other people say "Twilight is the worst book ever!!"|`|wxQKwBXNaa	The books and author selection is like this at night usally when the normal people come out, during the day it changes, I like stephen king, he is a bestseller and started out young.|`|U2wkJRrMaa	I love Chuck Palahniuk. He has a unique style of writing and an interesting point of view that (most times) I agree with. He makes valid points and spins an very interesting thread.    ---Yeah, everyone is most mean here at this time of night. They are all very opinionated about what they like and what they don't like. You wanna see some real angry people, go to Religion and Spirituality. Even when you are incredibly polite people there would love to rip you to shreds if they had the chance.|`|AyWaKdtmaa	Um, personally, I like James Patterson. But the one person I don't like is Stephen King. I don't know, but he's just so messed up, and always critisizing someone. Like Stephenie, and Patterson, who's my fav. writer. And like wasn't he on drugs? or something?|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Well that would have to be JK Rowling. She wrote the most magical and amazing book series I have ever read. My children's children will read those books!    Yes B&A is usually like this, it is mostly the Twi-Hards versus the Tw-Haters. I say if you are going to spend time on B&A you should get used to it!|`|w2rUIrH2aa	Stephanie Meyer  love the characters that she carried and the sweetness of her love story created in the twilight saga    Jk Rowling  was the first author to write a series which i read over and over again  she actually got me into reading    and     Jane Austen  to writer of the best book ever Pride and prejudice with superior originality that is being copied again and again         as for this section today is the first time i actually made it here LOL|`|XXc15qzzaa	ONE of many would be Jane Austen or the Bronte who wrote Wuthering Heights   BECAUSE they both depict truth in their works, about humanity. More so in Bronte's but more areas covered/nuanced in Austen's.|`|7iV0dIpGaa	I dnt hv jst one fav author... thr r mny.. Stephenie Meyer(fantasy, romance) and meg cabot(chick lit romance) ROCK!

I like books books by andy griffiths..they r vry funny n also goosebumps(horror) bi rl stine..|`|yY9KZiheaa	I say JKR. Basically the first author that wrote a long thick series of books. Apart from Odo Hirsch (well he didn't write thick books I don't think).     JKR is basically ONE of the best authors in history. She basically made a whole generation of kids into reading and after her series, fans read other books which sparks other fans.      One of the worst is Steph Meyer. Poor story, poor characters, poor everything. If her books were original and her style of writing was different and if the plot hadn't been done before, then yes I will be possibly a fn.|`|AA11271703	I like Roald Dahl.    Now, as I'm older and read his children books, I realise that there's so much more to it I never saw when I read it as a kid. It's a lot deeper and meaningful.    his books written for adults are also very interesting. Roald Dahl has a very strange, twisted sense of humour that you just can't help but love. :)|`|RzbRRUOdaa	I love Jane Austen.  Her writing style is elegant and satirical.  Her books carry stories and lessons beyond her time.  They are still very relevant today.    I also love JD Salinger.  His writing style is very radical especially The Catcher in the Rye.    You can see a lot of love-hate relationships in this 'books and authors' section in YA.  You'll even be surprised why really good and legitimate answers are given a thumbs down and sometimes deleted.    People give their opinions here.  And we can always respect people's opinion by agreeing to disagree.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Agatha Christie.  Nobody else writes mysteries like her.    Some books seem to inspire strong passions, like the Twilight series for instance.  Don't let it worry you.  It doesn't do to take the Internet too seriously.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I don't have a favourite author.     But I do have a favourite book. The Princess Bride by William Goldman. It's just a satirical fairy tale. But it's funny and I like the characters and the nonsensical things that happen.    Who's your favourite author? You didn't say.    I've been around here for about a year or so and it's always been very Twilightish. But lately there are more haters around than fangirls. It does seem very negative but I think that's just a phase.|`|XgejRqWsaa	All time favorite is Lewis Carroll. I have his complete works and I'm LOVING it.|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	In the writing form, right now I'd have to say JKR. She wrote the most amazing book series ever, and it appeals to all ages! [I sound like an advertiser].    I would've said Orson Scott Card [his books are amazing], but he's a raving lunatic when it comes to his ideas. I think he's crazy.     Well, actually, it's usually like this. Twilight takes over 1/2 the archives and the rest go to homework questions, book recommendations, is my story good, and every once in awhile, genuine literature questions.    I've never read Stephen King. I tried to, but I absoulutely can't read horror. I can watch it in a movie theater with a bajillion other people, but I'm too much of a wimp to read alone in my room..........      As a side note, I find it interesting that some of Stephenie Meyer's 'biggest fans' can't even spell her name correctly.    Edit: HEY HEY!! Watch where you're going with this one! I'm an agnostic [practically atheist, I usually just say atheist so people don't come along and try to convert me, but I really have that little seed of doubt in me] and I'm a not a jerk on R&S! I'd like to think that I'm quite polite, except when it comes to superreligious people who are telling everyone that they're going to hell for being heretics.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Hm....there are just too many. From Sci-Fi/Fantasy I'll have to go with Marion Zimmer Bradley. Her writing is both sophisticated and magical. It was the first time I had read a book (Mists of Avalon) that I just couldn't put down, once I'd started reading. J.K. Rowling seconds that list. From the classics I'd have to go with Jane Austen & William Shakespeare. I would have put Charles Dickens in that category as well but I'm currently reading Bleak House and I'm so frustrated with it that if the poor bloke was alive I'd feel the urge to throw the book at him.|`|phH2dVYZaa	My favourite author is MEG CABOT, for the following reasons:  -I love her genre. It's romance, with a bit of something else, of course. She has romance and a wide wide variety of different genres...sci-fi, mystery, supernatural, paranormal romances, historical, etc  -She writes in a captivating way. She's not boring, but she is clever in her writing, and you just can't put the book down. And have to read things over and over again...  -I learnt a lot from her books, if you believe that!  -There's something for everyone; humour, mystery, supernatural, whatever you like. Name it.  -She's nice - she replies to ALL her fanmail! She has like 7000 messages a day or something but she always replies to my fanmail no matter how long/annoying it is ;D    And in short, she is just kick ***.|`|GRoOEkNeaa	Stephen King, He has very good books, that I enjoy. He's like an inspiration to all, in the writing books field or even in general. (Yes I do love the horror stories)     BQ: I don't know, I'm not a regular in the Books & Authors section. But every section does have it's hates/haters to some degree. & I do agree and I do notice that. (The agreements/disagreements on people's opinions/suggestions)|`|a796jDdlaa	Stephenie Meyer.   She's my favorite author because I love her books, and I want to be a writer. I can relate to how she writes, because her work looks like something I might write..though not as good as her. lol.|`|6PSFH4eKaa	I LOVE LOVE LOVE Richelle Mead. Her books are soooooo much better than Twilight. They actually have sex and we get more details. I like that aspect of them  I still am a big fan of Twilight but these are way way way better|`|YpmcXaNJaa	I have a few... Melina Marchetta, Louise Renninson, Stephanie Meyer, J.K Rowling.. To name a few... I like them becaus they are good writers. For example, Louise Renninson is extreamly funny They write what i like to read.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	Scott Sigler is my favorite because I can listen to all his books on his website or as podcasts. He has a fun evil persona but is really a very nice guy. Since you can get the books for free but still buy them he jokes about being like a drug dealer only with books not drugs.  He tells outrageous lies that are obviously false when it persona that can be quite humorous and give fun to hear rants.  He writes Sci fi/horror/thrillers. I like cross genre fiction.
LutYGBpRaa	I'm glad your almost stepping into the threshold of stephen king's world. yes, he's a great writer.     just to share my experience...    i've just had a fever yesterday, but luckily, it receded last night, until it finally faded and i'm back to my healthy self again. but just this morning, i decided to finish Misery by mr. king, and honestly, i was like nauseous. i thought i was gonna be sick again! it was gross! THAT COCKADOODIE ANNIE WILKES WILL MAKE YOUR STOMACH CHURN. so if you want to be grossed out once in awhile, then read stephen king, especially misery.     salem's lot, however, is an excellent scary read. it's not necessarily yucky--there were some staking of vampires that took place, though--but f you have a pretty good imagination, you'll be scared more than a bit (i remember, i couldn't sleep for nights because of the hubby-marsten-hung-on-the-wall scene).     gerald's game was so sexual--not intended for kids (uhmm..like me?). a shade or two worse than his other works.|`|uoEfoI7aaa	rated best on top.

8asG4WCwaa	it was already published by Over The Wall, Inc. and appears to possibly be out of print.  I found it listed for sale on several sites not among your list, so I'm not sure what you mean by the publisher didn't follow through.    1 - you need to review the contract with Over The Wall (since you are unfamiliar with publishing, you should have a literary lawyer do this, which you should be able to find under the Association of Author Representatives website).      2 - if rights have reverted to you, and Over The Wall is not interested in reprinting it, you can attempt to interest another publisher or agent in it.  You will need to do some research on who might be interested (I do not suggest you do any kind of self publishing).    3 - Do not offer anyone here a share in the profits, you will either end up with relatively useless information or get scammed into a vanity press.  The only person who you should share with is an agent.    4 - consider joining absolutewrite.com/forum (the watercooler) where there is a large group of authors and several agents and editors who frequent the forum, and likely someone there can help point you in the right direction.  They will know if Over The Wall is a traditional or vanity press, what agent or publishers might be interested in second rights, and other useful information.|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	why dont you try www.lulu.com
wJ45gsyZaa	Hamlet thinks polonius deserves to die. All throughout the play polonius weaves his webs and hamlet despises it. Even the fact that he was the one hiding behind the curtain (?) proves that polonius isn't a solid guy.    Rozencrantz and Guildenstern were hamlets closest friends, when they betray him, he gets driven deeper into madness or anger and deppression because even the people closest to him have turned against him.    Hamlet desperately wants to kill his uncle and send him to hell, but he wants to kill him so badly that he doesn't think he can wait until he has sinned again or whatever (he just did confession I think...) so that the uncle will actually go to hell. (I'm doing this all from memory of the play, sorry if it's not the right part I'm talking about)    I hated Claudius. I think he has a miniscule concience, but, he still killed his brother and married his wife!! low blow...    Hope that helps, I read the play like two years ago....|`|DIEih5asaa	That Shakespear has a lot to answer for.
AA10744471	The fastest way to be published is what is called "vanity-publishing" or "self-publishing". This is the fastest way and you have control, but this is also the most expensive way. Yet many better writers started on vanity publishing, consider Umberto Eco or James Redfield, and succeded in becoming best selling authors. There is really nothing wrong with self-publishing and the stigma once attached to it are now s thing of the past. Go for it!|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	try www.lulu.com they help you to self-publish|`|DW7J8huQaa	First, get them critiqued by people who don't know you personally.  That way you get an unbiased opinion.  Then, you need to query agents.  Check the writer's marketplace for agents who sell children's books (and don't query people who don't...it's a waste of time).  Research agent's submission guidelines and follow them exactly or they won't even consider representing you.  Then, if an agent likes your work, they will send it to editors and help you to get it published.    And I hate to say this, but vanity publishing is not the best way to go.  What that says to the publishing world is that you couldn't find an agent/editor who liked your stuff so why should anyone like it?  Plus, it's expensive, you have to work to get it on the shelves of bookstores, and it often costs way more money than you make.  Very few popular authors have started this way.  I repeat: very few.

XvO4iLk0aa	G Half a minute ago I gave the LDK for the eighth time this morning.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|AA10729675	Too often.  I do not think of myself enough.  It is terrible.  It should not be that way.  Last week, I gave good advice to someone who did nothing to help me. I should have refrained from being so good.  But it is compulsory and it does not help me at all.|`|31fDBuLjaa	I'm not that self-righteous.    No seriously. I pick up litter as I walk. Anywhere I am. I see a discarded empty bottle of Gatorade, I pick it up and carry it till I find a garbage can.|`|AA11550519	Never. I do nice things-to people I love, or to the really destitute strangers. I come off the experience feeling better about myself, and with people i know, I can request a favor later without feeling like a leech.    I support charitable causes-in my area, or that i agree with. Everything I do has at least a touch of personal interest. It can be material or intellectual interest, but personal none the less.     Nothing wrong there!|`|h3gMzNS3aa	Even altruism is a form narcissism. It's part of the hero-complex inate in human nature. It can be institutionalised into after-death rewards too. I meditated somewhere on Saturday and gave some money in appreciation of using the room.|`|PtoieF7Caa	There's always the argument about whether an action is truly selfless or not.  People argue that such actions give people a sense of self satisfaction or gratification and therefore it isn't truly selfless because they got something out of it.    My previous comment aside, i'd say I do little things most everyday. I think a lot of people do, whether or not they realize it at the time.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	I am uncertain that it is possible for anybody to give you the correct answer based on their knowledge. How are you able to prove whether a deed you performed was altruistic? Your actions are driven by your unconscious mind which is a highly complex mechanism. It is difficult to reach deep into your unconscious mind and find out exactly every single reason why you performed a good deed. For an example, a person may perform a good deed not out of best interest for the party in need of help but just to make himself/herself feel good. Make sense?  ---------  Edit:     My reply above is the same as Sisyphus' response, it is the presentation/expression that is different. He/She is right, this is called deep cynicism, every altruistic deed is a form of narcissism. Way to go!|`|4maV4O1aaa	Every second - by gracing the world with my presence.    Just a joke - I try to keep others in mind all the time by being polite and considerate, but I don't think there's actually any such thing as a truly altruistic act.  It feels good to do good, so we get when we give, too.|`|AA10985416	Not often enough.  Seriously.  I should do more.    My activities revolve around serving young women and their families, as I am a mother of 5 grown children.  The family I  am actively involved with has 3 kids, one who is non-verbal at 10 years old, and severely challenged.  The Dad travels out of town once or twice a week so I go over and lend a hand.  I just try to be an extra set of eyes, ears and hands for the Mom and a cheerful motivator for the rest.      The honest truth is this family gives me more than I give them.  They praise me, seem to LOVE my jokes and games, and when I hug one of those kids, I feel GOOD.  This family routinely calls me their "angel" and I leave taller than when I walked in.  So maybe I am doing it all for me...but I do try to find people or circumstances where one woman, a little bitty one at that, can do SOMETHING...even if it is a small thing, and usually every week provides an opportunity to serve, if I accept the challenge.  Honestly, sometimes I walk away when I should do something else.    I should do that more, but giving your heart away takes a great deal of energy I don't have due to health problems.  And getting involved sometimes hurts, because you can't change people or the "way things are."|`|2Ko12Elfaa	Every day, I guess.  For reasons I'm not going to go into, I'm overly aware of my surroundings.  And it just doesn't make any sense to see something wrong and not do anything about it.  I gave a homeless man money today... not a lot, but it was like 50% of my current net worth.    Edit:  I don't understand why psychological egoism is so trendy.  If your stance is that people perform altruistic acts to feel good about themselves, here's a question for you: WHY DOES IT MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD?
8KBYpo7Eaa	Its a lot easier to save a spider then it is to save an army of ants. If it is a common house spider, I usually scoop it onto a piece of paper and put a cup over it and place it back outside. Ants and spiders are both key elements to our ecosystem, but, if I could pick a spider up insuring it would not crawl on my persons, I would save it. I could not do the same with an army of ants. If I did the same thing with ants(paper and cup technique), in about 2 seconds, I would have ants crawling all over me. Same thing with a spider, if it crawls on me, i kill it. If it were one ant, it would probably go unnoticed, therefore, I wouldn't have to save it. I only save a spider to save myself from having it crawl on me. Selfish huh?|`|MlG1YnqCaa	Ignore it you if you not OCD, kill it if you are.|`|5RZ4R3Rnaa	Vaccum cleaner.

Put the jar/container over the spider. If the spider is hanging around the rim, start to slide it down the wall and hopefully it'll move to a lower part of the jar/container. Gently and slowly slide the lid to capture the spider. Let it free outside.     Goodluck!|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	leave it     It has as much right as life as you do.|`|b453xLGiaa	I stare at it and it goes away. haha!

Don't worry about swallowing it on accident because your breathe with scare the spider away as soon as it gets anywhere close to your nose or mouth.
HLcs0epWaa	It would be better if you use other words when trying to find a rhyme for down or up etc, try using other words instead of picking the easy way out.  try this site for words--  www.rhymezone.com  (:  try focusing more on the topic of the poem rather than wandering away from the subject..

Best of luck.|`|ccgcJ9PKaa	For starters stop the dot dot dots.    Its not bad: could improve on focusing on what the poem is about.

Not even all the treasures and the silly things we've possessed.

r68xD4JFaa	No, he was a mediocre, at best, author.    The passage that sticks in my mind of bad sci-fi is from Battlefield Earth and would be a page long description of how a base ten mathematical system is somehow innately "better" than a base 12 mathematical system.  Now, you might be able to make a argument for a binary or even a base 16 system being better, but 10 over 12?      Then you add in the rest, it's just sub-par.  Sure he isn't as bad as say Newt Gingrich's attempts at sci-fi, but the guy was never first rank or even second rank in my opinion.  If he hadn't founded a religion, he wouldn't be remembered at all.  There are simply to many great and good authors from that period to waste your time with a third rate one like Hubbard.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	It's a bit, well, rambling. Not really my flavour of sci-fi.|`|AA10242125	L. Ron Hubbard, made a bet with Robert Heinlein that he could start a religion. Fred Pohl was there and I heard it from Fred.    He wrote adventure novels, pirate novels, and science fiction in addition to Dianetics.    I got a free copy of one of his pirate novels at last years American Library Association. Not too bad.    I just dislike the salesmanship of the Scientology people.|`|u23sua9daa	Yes he was a good author.|`|Lg5hW4GWaa	read some of his books when i was a kid, only heard about scientology later in life. His books are rubbish, can't understand why he's based a "religion" on them.
JZCbAR4Yaa	Meg Cabot's books are better than Stephanie Meyer's.  At least that's my opinion. I just think that they are better written and it feels like more thought has been put into the story. And something actually happens and it doesn't take for ever for anything to happen.  And plus, Jesse is awesome. He's more real than Sparkles the Vamp will ever be.    I love Anne Rice too. Lestat is the best fictional vampire ever, in my opinion.|`|bM9Y79wHaa	Stephenie Meyer is a better writer than Meg Cabot. Her relationships between characters aren't that sexual. Only in the last book. And it IS a romance series.|`|35JIECGRaa	You know why people are "ungrateful" about this list? Because you're insulting them by putting down their favorite book, and you're telling them what they should and shouldn't read!    You know why everyone is on your case about being a Twilighter-hater? I don't care if you are or not, I'm a Harry Potter/Twilight lover ... but I hate your god damn attitude! It's "Twilight Sucks" this and "These Books are Better" that and "Stephenie Meyer can't write" ... GIVE IT A REST ALREADY!!! We get it, you hate twilight ... can you please ask better yahoo questions and stop wasting my time? Do you know how many emails I get saying Rafal H asked a question, all because you added me into your contacts!?|`|k3l9pJTjaa	let me give you a better question: if you don't like twilight you will like 100% of all the good books out there, but if you do like twilight, you're doomed! lol|`|AA11271703	I agree.    Meg Cabot's a really good writer. Her character's have so much more personalities (as they aren't Mary Sues) and the books have more entertainment value.    Plus there is actually a plot.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	To be perfectly honest?    All you're doing is make me never want to read anything by "MEG CABOT", ever. You give the impression that you're just trying to sell one author's books.|`|JEP4CmyUaa	I like Meg Cabot but not as much as I like Stephenie Meyer. I read Pants on Fire by Meg Cabot, it was kind of sexual. House of Night, Uglies, Vampire Kisses series. I would also recommend Vampire Academy series. Dont be so harsh on us Twilighters!|`|7iV0dIpGaa	Yeah Meg is Definitely good!! I love Mediator, especially, jesse more than anything! But I cant say she's bettre then Steph cz I think both of em r pretty much equal n cn create awesom characters like jesse n edward! Also those u like twilight may also like vampire diaries although i havnt read it bt hv heard a lot abt it...
aFVzMM5laa	I have to agree.  It's the worst bestseller I've ever read.  SMeyer's writing is clunky, adverb-heavy, and amateurish.  As the great Stephen King said "Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn."|`|pQBjqMkoaa	lol you cant give yourself 10 points silly =P|`|usvPMtMtaa	aahahahahahahahahaha i laughed  smeyer murdered literature    mmmm breaking dawn was worse than twilight.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I find a lot of books that are best sellers are annoying. They are often predictable and have enormous plot holes.    Like in The Da Vinci Code. Who cares if Sophie's DNA matches Mary Magdalene's? That doesn't prove that she's related to Jesus.    I also HATE the Stephanie Plum bounty hunter series. They actually anger me. Silly being angered by a book I know, but I just don't like the writing style or any of the characters in it.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Sorry but you've named the impossible    There is nothing worse than Twilight|`|XUQaRpgxaa	twilight is not the worst bestseller and its a good book you know some   people just want different genre|`|XXc15qzzaa	The Amber Spyglass from the Dark Materials trilogy.   The other two were fine. But the 3rd was worse than the first couple twilight books. The last twilight book should not have even been published the way it was    EDIT:  anything written by Tamora Pearce  EDIT:  ENDRAGON!!!! worst books ever|`|FF9mMlgKaa	yeah it even tops My Dad's names Flute was a Fiddle.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Fearless Fourteen by Janet Evanovich  I've read all the Stephanie Plum novels, and for the most part have liked them a lot.  I think Evanovich has a great voice and Plum's antics are pretty hilarious.  My only problem with the novels in the series is that they are progressively getting worse.  I don't know if it is because Evanovich is running out of ideas or if she is just being pushed to write them so quickly that the content is compromised.  And would Stephane please choose between Joe and Ranger already?  The sexual tension is killing me.    Also the Davinci Code by Dan Brown. The Da Vinci Code may well be the only novel ever written that begins with the word renowned.I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to spend a number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in the history of literature was this. Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalistic stories about deaths; you just don't do it in describing an event in a narrative. Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with alternatives.     Honestly, I think these two are torture in book form.|`|phH2dVYZaa	My reading materials are basically...MEG CABOT  So the worst MEG CABOT bestseller [most of them are bestsellers in fact] was Queen of Babble 3    WHO DOES THAT!    I mean, it's bad to those who followed the series before. It was so annoying.

8asG4WCwaa	The publishing industry runs on word counts, not pages, since formatting and font size affect the number of words on a page.    A short story is less than 8000 words  a novelette is less than 18,000 words  a novela is less than 40,000 words  a novel is more than 40,000 (although many genres do not consider a novel under 60,000 and some 80,000)    Collections by unknown authors do not sell.  The best way to publish them is to sell them individually to magazines and anthologies that accept stories.    You really need to learn more aout writing and publishing.  Not knowing enough about the industry is likely to get you scammed (and there are a lot of scams out there).|`|AjqO1aJgaa	A novel is normally between 60,000 and 110,000 words.    30 pages is barely a novella - personally I'd call it a short story. Having written several short stories does not make them a novel.|`|Bh6Bgzhoaa	Novella is what we call stories that length and it is very common for an author to combine several unrelated novellas into a single volume, which then be simply called a collection.    If the stories are related and tell one continuous story the normal strategy would be to combine them in a novel and call each section a separate "Book" containing between five and 15 chapters but the exact numbers are up to the author and the publisher.  Generally anything longer than 20 or so pages but less than 100 could be called a novella.  maybe as high as 200 but around 200 you are pretty much in novel territory.  Publishers may have stricter guidelines for what they consider novels but if you shoot for 200 pages you should be plenty safe.
RzbRRUOdaa	You are now talking of the form or layout of your book.  I presume that you are done writing and editing its contents.    You don't need to indent every paragraph.  This is called block layout.  But as a writer, you must concentrate on your material.  Meaning, your story.  The publisher can take care of the form and do copyediting for you as part of the publishing package.    You may want to check this site on publishing:  http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	Typing 101 you indent five spaces at the start of every paragraph.  (or tab 5)  --    Grammar 101 a paragraph typically consists of a unifying main point, thought, or idea accompanied by supporting details.    --  When dialogue is being quoted in fiction, a new paragraph is used each time the person being quoted changed.  (I was taught many years ago that you indent three spaces for dialogue quotes.  But that seems to be up for debate.)    ---   Leaving simple stuff like that to your editor is not ideal.  One it makes reading the passage more difficult and that means more work for them, you want to put your best foot forward since you are trying to get them to take a chance on signing you.  You want to give them every reason to believe you are better, more professional and more agreeable than the next guy.  Leave as little extra work for them to do.    ---  Your sample above is good.  As for chapters when a full 'concept' is drawing to a close you end the chapter or rather a main division.  Chapter one is introducing your characters as they have a conversation in the car, chapter two could be them arriving at the destination or you could extend chapter one.  The next chapter is usually the next day.  Days and time are usually a good chapter break so that you don't have to write out every hour.  Meals are also a good break.  Location, travel from one point to another leave one place end chapter arrive at another start next chapter.       ---   If a character is left alone good place to end a chapter, next chapter when he arrives at his next destination or wakes the next morning.  End of a phone call, good place to end a chapter.  These are all pretty obvious but they are a good way to start until you get a better feel for your characters.    ---  I have yet to read a book with no chapters.  Chapters are a necessary evil.  Publishers will expect them even if they are long or short.  Using the above example you could have Jake shake his head as the man disappeared behind a corner, mumble something to himself and end the chapter.  Next chapter may open with the man being seen on the news dead with a broken neck after having fallen 40 feet to his death.

1243f4e8337cd349f01721fab2d47a02aa	I don't know Plantinga's work but...     I read in the Oxford Handbook on rationality an essay about practical rationality where it said that in theoretical rationality, not choosing an option when not having enough evidence is the rational thing, but in practical rationality it might be irrational to make no choice if both are indifferent. I think from that framework we could take belief in God to be an issue of practical rationality.
W8F9PboZaa	Just... don't go into a book shop unless absolutely necessary. I've been employing this tactic for the last year and has halved my book buying. I had a relapse at christmas though. Impulse bought Obernewtyn by Isobelle Carmody and then convinced myself that if I bought the first one I had to buy the next 5, each at $50. And i don't have a job anymore. And have to pay for this years uni. And use a tank of petrol a week. Oh jesus.  The fact I'm practically broke is helping too.

But everything there is just so tempting. And it's often on special too. Alas, if I bought everything that I thought was a good idea, I wouldn't be able to afford to eat.

As long as I don't already have it, I'd appreciate it.  But then again I guess it depends who you're giving it too. Some people are book snobs. I am not.

4vLt3SqFaa	go -go dancers are still around in some states like NJ that don't allow nudity where adult beverages are served.  Generally they will strip down to a g-string  but whether they need coverage of the breasts depend upon the state. In truth breast coverage means nipple coverage and usually that is all that gets covered - not with pasties but with a dancer's finger.   In most cases dancers manage to work around laws because the more nudity shown the better the tips.  So she will adjust her g-string allowing everyone a good view while not intentionally exposing herself.  HA HA    It is a little odd in that it is generally perceived as exploitative of women, but I always though it really exploited men.  Men are visually turned-on and will gladly waste money to simply get a glimpse of a unclad woman.       I mean would you rather  see some stranger show herself off for money leaving you as lonely as you were before, of find a woman and not only see her body, but make love to it?   It seems to me to be the resort of men too lazy to invest in a real male.female relationship or of men too socially inept to be able to get a woman.

Of course there was no "deep dialoge" as we humans understand it and want it to be. Meaning there was basic, real communication but there were no bells and whistles and fireworks or spoons bending or anything to make it "deep" in the way we want it to be.

American Farmers had borrowed a lot of money, secured by their land, to ramp up production...    But as our supply was peaking, Europe was recovering, which sent demand & consequently prices plumting.    Farmers defaulted on their loans, but when banks forclosed, they discovered the price of land was BASED on the price of grain, so the loans were effectively unsecured.   The banks started collapsing, this sent the stock market into convulsions.    Bottom line, the Great Depression was caused by bad loans.    Now our little recession was caused by bad loans too.   But in this case it was Washington Liberals forcing banks to make bad subprime loans to the poor.    Now it make some sense to bailout the institutions forced into stupidity by the Government BUT...    The people who caused the crisis, used it to get elected, and are now utilizing economic panic to turn what should be VERY conservative & targeted spending into a GIANT vote & pork buying extravaganza.      See, there are a few banks that have been victimized - but the only reason to bailout automakers driven to bankruptcy by inane union contracts, is because the unions vote liberal.    See learning form the past would be keeping a watchful eye to help American business avoid running afoul world ecomomic trends.    What we have here is a bunch of self serving morons CREATING problems for the American & World ecomomy.          Your bad feeling is justified.

Pumping more money isn't the solution its weakening whatever worth we have of the dollar away which is basically nothing.

It was modernized by French people who installed the rail-road, electricity, phones, airports etc.  Algeria was a French territory.  Life in Morocco and Tunisia seems to be sweet.  I've read books written by women from Morocco and Tunisia.  They always mention good food and sweet drinks (mint tea, etc..) I have read books written by women from Algeria, and it is completely different.  Maybe because of the desert (Sahara) and the harsh life of the desert.  I don't know.  I wish I could visit those countries, especially Morocco and Tunisia.
uDEmwTfjaa	personification is when an inanimate object or something inhuman have human characteristics.... so it creates an imaginative and philosophical effect on poetry making it seem more interesting, dramatic, and create a certain mood or tone.|`|MQNz7Yrtaa	everything, from the sceme, to the stanza to the subject and right through to the reading of the text and the interpretation.|`|NXLWiDvOaa	Personification also helps with metaphor- used quite a bit in poetry.    A Metaphor is a figure of speech in which a term or phrase is applied to something to which it is not literally applicable in order to suggest a resemblance, as in A mighty fortress is our God.     There are times when you need to personify the inanimate object so that the metaphor makes sense, and the reader can relate to the metaphor easier.

Did I mention happened to mention he was a "heterosexual".    Only a "Real" man could have choreographed "Big Spender" from the musical Chicago. Laughing out loud and all that jazz.    "All That Jazz" is a movie inspired by "Bob Fosse's" life story hollywood's "Artistic Liberty accounted for" it is one hell of a story.    He inspired "Ann Rakin's" starring role in the movie and You just know she really must have shown her appreciation in a hundered ane one ways!  OoooH Ann Rankin!    Ok! I digress:  Now I won't choose a tune for you however; I will give you my process for choosing a piece of music that may work for you, present you with a challenge and most importantly be "current and maybe even on the airwaves"    Check out the movie sound tracks that recieved "Golden Globe" awards, nothing I can think of however; follow up and see if there are any sound tracks from movies being nominated for the "Oscar's".     Check This out!  http://www.screenhead.com/reviews/catego...    The sound track from "Soul Men" would be worth down loading for a listen; Black music is more than simply the flavour of the month and If you go "Black Music" that isn't "authentic jazz music" then you can not go wrong with classic Ryhtm and Blues. Great feel go music for an audition piece.    "Soul Men" movie soundtrack    Track  7. Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) - Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings (2:59)    Track 12. Do Your Thing - Bernie Mac, Samuel L. Jackson & Sharon Leal (13:54)  Thirteen minutes of music to edit out\ This could well be it pr do I here a medely coming on!! Could be!    Go  Blues Brother look of the 1950's ; dancing a sole music medely from "Soul Men" (now re popularized by an oscar nomination the music will be in the air during the oscar wards, tune into the awards show and you might get some idea's)    Have fun in the studio and you may consider some backup dancing  brothers!

You can't hand over freedom when you had the slave system for so long.  You had blacks going hungry.  You had blacks that had their complete lifestyles taken away from them not that it was a great lifestyle.      For those that were young and healthly, they had a chance to live life.  But for those that were older, they no longer had the masters to take care of them.  I'm not saying that slavery was a good thing but you can't change the world over night.  When you have not been educated in how to use money, the cost of things, no roof over your head, and other items like this: then you have a lot of suffering.  And not fast suffering but years and years of suffering without a way out and they are still suffering today because of the effects of the slavery times.      I believe that is one of the reasons that we still have issues with racism.  When you have a large group of people that can not take care of themselves, not because they are stupid but that they are ingorant and untrained and not give the tools to help themselve, then they can't train the next generation to take care of themselves.  Each generation of blacks have had the same issues from the time of the civil war.  Living on the edge of society.  Issues with money and finding good jobs.  Education level and even if you do get the education not being able to find a job because of bias.  Today we have the gangs which are training the next generation on how to get money.      The Jews were killed more quickly but they also had the hope and the chance to change their lives if they made it out of the camps or avoid them in some cases.  The blacks had very little chance of changing thier lifestyles, if anything they got freedom and then they had harder lives in may ways.  They were told that they had to make it on their owns with no jobs, no homes, no education, and little or no help to get out of under the proverty which was back in slavory but at least they know that they would get food and shelter, if nothing else.  Even if the old master wanted to help, most of them losed everything in the war and could not help if they wanted too.      The Jews had lived free and had something of a life before the war and they had a life after the war.  The slaves were throw out on the streets with less then we give the foster children today.    Therefore, both situations were not great but the slaves had it better.  The Jews have over come WWII but the american black has not over come slavery.

You can either look it as - no two people are the same, even if you agree about one thing theres always something else you'll disagree about so each individual is unique - or originality is dead and its all been done before so there is no 'rebelling' 'not being like anyone else'.    the rhymes you use are too easy, if you're so bold like you say you are try something harder.
7f7aa0ea5dc924471fffd54e742f67ddaa	Hopefully, you will not have to wander too far to find the answers to your questions about the wars in Vietnam.    The First Indochina War - this took place between December, 1946 and August, 1944.  The Second Indochina War - November, 1955 - April, 1975    Both wars happened gradually, in increments, first between the Vietnamese and the French, Then between the Vietnamese people of the DRV and the RVN, and the United States.    Both wars occurred for many reasons: The First Indochina War was fought by the people of Vietnam to gain their independence from France. The Second Indochina War was fought by the Vietnamese people, against the Vietnamese people with the United States (and several other nations as allies) to unify their country under one government as a socialist republic.    What happened in Vietnam (as well as the neighboring countries of Laos, and Cambodia) was nearly 30 years of war, millions of deaths, and the eventual victory of the Vietnamese people in 1975.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Tomorrow's homework?
o16Z34u6aa	The depression that began in the United States in 1929 went around the world in the years that followed.    By 1932, more than 30 million people could not find a job. That same year, industrial production worldwide was 38 percent less than it had been in 1929.    Just as in the U.S., unemployment rates in Germany and Great Britain reached 25 percent in 1932. In Germany that meant that over 5.5 million people were out of work. Some historians point to that fact as one of the reasons that democracy broke down and Adolph Hitler gained dictatorial power.    What caused the Great Depression to become a worldwide event? Some economists say that the fact that there was an international monetary system tied to the price of gold made the different economies closely related. Problems in one large economy were passed on to others and eventually back to the country where the problems began.    Others point to the fact that a trade war developed. Throughout the 1920s, American farmers exported commodities worth an average of almost $2 billion a year. Ag exports accounted for 42% of all U.S. exports. During the 1930s, ag exports dropped by almost two-thirds to $765 million and accounted for only 32% of exports. In part, the drop was caused by protective tariffs that were imposed on foreign ag products and the tariffs other countries imposed in retaliation.

I see you're a fan of Dorothy Koomson...I think her best (and most heart-wrenching book) is Goodnight, Beautiful. Most definitely read it!    Oh, Ceceila Ahern is good too. I like Thanks For The Memories.    Aha, I do remember a book I loved at 14 - Whispers On The Water by Audrey Howard.

There are so many.    Well, I'd say A Little Princess for one. Written by Frances something something x.x Whoops. I forgot her name.     Next I'd suppose The Garden of Empress Cassia. It's actually like a kid's book for 10 year olds, but personally I find it very meaningful. Children books are a lot deeper than they appear to be sometimes.    I think Princess Diaries is also quite a good read. Meg Cabot gave Mia a personality that really comes to life. The characterization is awesome, and it really pulls the laughs from  you.    i just finished another book quite recently. Called A Life in Pieces. It was really very good. The story  is abut a woman whom, because of extreme abuse during her childhood, developed 17 different personalities. And so the book is basically about her and her 17 alters. Very interesting, although some parts describing the abuse is a bit too much for me.    And plenty other books too. Those are just a few from the top of my head. :)|`|90zIsbWWaa	I love reading as well and to really pick just one book  it has to be Harry Potter, just can't beat it.  my favorite out of that would have to be Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.     other books from other genres that i can read over and over again would be The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova and The Alex Rider series by Anthony Horowitz.|`|iOW2aLeGaa	yepp i love chick-lit books 2  :D    my faves are probz  sea change--kate cann---AMAZING  twilight seriese-stephenie meyer--EVEN MORE AMAZING  girls out late/girls in love/girls in tears/girls under pressure--jaquline wilson  coffestions--cart rember da author--really good  and basilcly al the girls/love stories:D  xx|`|AI18zgU6aa	TWILIGHT!

There are guys who read Twilight.|`|CGQ6w2KHaa	i have a handful of friends from school who have read it. some of them have liked it, while others have not.   i think most of them only read it in order to figure out what all the comotion over edward vs. jacob was...  but others i think read it cuz they thoguht it'd be good.|`|eAcKjgzyaa	I know a 36 year old guy who is obsessed with the series. What's more he is a huge Edward fan and what's even more, he is not gay.|`|1YyoR8Taaa	im sorry but if a guy enjoyed twilight that'd be a bit gay!!    twilight is badly written the only reason its so popular is because the story goes exactly the way you want with a happily ever after!!    otherwise it really really suck!!|`|O9F9UTMoaa	Ok I absolutely love the twilight series and of course im a guy. Its not gay in my opinion. theres nothing gay about a man(vampire lol) and woman being in love, its jsut awesome.

XmqBe2skaa	i think because we a part of a time continueum / here is a website that may explain it / lol /|`|1XRHUCvtaa	Time doesn't really move forward, we just think it does.  Just imagine, we are created from the earth by an anti-rotting process, and get younger, more innocent as time goes on, before finally entering our mothers and being absorbed by her to help her grow younger.    The way we see time is like the way we see everything in the universe. It is relative to our needs and senses. My chair isn't really solid... it's mostly made of empty space... but I don't fall through it, even though I am also mostly empty space. My senses tell me I am 'full/solid' enough though I am not. My senses tell me time moves in one direction, but there's no way of knowing if it really does.|`|Di7zRKEIaa	in the past it may have moved backwards|`|QYPrM3GPaa	It would only happen that way, if you were willing to accomodate the fact of unexperieincing everything you had ever experienced.  This is not a way of becoming yourself - you can only become yourself by going forward with your experience.  What I mean by this is, in order for you to BE yourself, you have to experience yourself and therefore fulfill your knowing about yourself.  The progression that God created is:    Knowing proceeds to experiencing proceeds to Being    Not -    Being proceeds to unexperiencing proceeds to unknowing.    You cannot un-know something, but you can definitely be made to forget that you know it so as to pretend you are something or someone else.  It's really a trick and an illusion you see - you have undertaken to be who you are now so that you can experience what you know and thus become something even greater than you realized you were before.  I know this doesn't probably make a lot of sense to you, but this IS the answer to your question -    Simply put - you cannot UNDO YOUR KNOWING.  When you know something, you know it for all eternity and that knowing can not be taken from you.  You cannot experience that which you do not know but you can pretend you have forgotten what you know so as to experience it in different or new ways and thus become the being that you knew all along that you were.    Further - time itself is an illusion.  Time does not REALLY exist.  It is just a simple relativistic idea.  Do take note though, everything you have ever experienced in your life is RIGHT NOW - it has always been this way, you are always IN THE MOMENT, never before it or after it, but always in it.  So the perception that time is moving anywhere, forward or backward is merely an illusion - it is what you think is happening to you, not what is really happening.  And since every experience you have ever had is right now, in reality then - therer is only one time, and that is NOW - so in fact, you are really living in an absolute life without thinking you are.      Think about what I said.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	Interesting thought. Everything is in order, situations move on, people move on. Imagine if I were to post this answer somewhere before you even asked this question. Imagine your mother giving birth to you before she had intercourse with her husband, your dad. ... And so on.........|`|t8JQJP7Xaa	And yet you can ask yourself if we lived in a world like that, "Why does time move backward? Would it not be interesting if we started from birth and moved forward?"|`|e4tvh1d2aa	time dose not move. time is an illusion  created by the invention of clocks.  time is only the space between events dividing the moments that the sun sets and rises.  now what you are talking about health going in reverse.  the issue is that when born you would be extremely unhealthy.  as most people of old age at death are and when you die you must go back into your mother.  it is logicly impossible  however trans humanism attempts to change the death dynamic,  to end unwanted death.  by perpetuating human life, by preventing physical death and storing  mental capacities in a computer to be restored to a new adult brain  immortality is nearly in our grasp.|`|zZY3JX30aa	It doesn't. The idea that time is "linear" is something man did to keep track of things.|`|ti97SKNSaa	Benjamin Button stemmed question? Nice!    Yeah it would be cool!|`|XXc15qzzaa	But then that would seem like the "forward" version of time.   I don't think time is concrete but neither do i think it's going to switch up on us either :)
AA12231462	My bed is on the floor  - no room for a gzunder and my toilet is only twenty paces from the bed - I like anything quirky though and accept art works from any one - I have a few of my own in my garden- including my own head buried in soil - I put different hats on it sou wester ad swimming goggles - You could make me a gnome pot    .

If your serious then what sort of wheel have you,if it is a direct drive cone driven then you could throw upto 25kg in one go ,if it is a belt drive then use two fist fulls max,you can always add as you centre and cone.    My advice to all who have a go is to visualise the overal shape of a vase/pot and to "grow" a straight cylinder higher than the finished shaped pot.    You could make a round pot with a lip,like a ming dynasty pot by pushing out the straight cylinder and collaring the top quarter.    I would like a tea pot,and indeed only called myself a potter once i had suceeded in producing one :-)    If your using a standing kick wheel then only throw a small pot at first as it is rather exhausting.    Whatever you make,enjoy it in both creation and firing and glazing and firing again ! Then enjoy it forever after or sell it if you can,that way you have a hobby/pasttime that pays its way.    if you wish to see any of my works you are welcome to go to f book and search for simon james wolf henry and add as friend and see in my albums,you may copy or get ideas from some of those works.    I sell in a Gallery and have been exhibition secretary for a few years.    I am not sure why you need "goggles"unless your Raku firing  or a "hat" unless you have long hair.    A lot of car parts,panels are sculpted in clay first and many everyday items have their first forms made by skilful sculptors,so there are many fields of occupation from clay craft.

XXc15qzzaa	It seems like mostly they ('they' in a sense of distinction only, I am a teen) like reading books that hand you what you want.  Happy perfect characters who come to good ends because they are good. Even with depth, good characters end up all right just because the author doesn't want anyone to be upset.    I prefer books (like those :P) but also I need a variance from that because life isn't about escapism and we shouldn't let ourselves see the world as we want it because amazing innocents come to bad ends every day.   sorry, rant.  I like books that reveal human truths. Universal truths. Absolute truths. (which are out there despite popular argument for otherwise)    The Giver  The Bible  Wuthering Height's  Jane Austen's books  Narnia  Some shakespeare (hamlet mostly, and a midsummer night's dream)  autobiographies (end of the spear, for whom the world was not worthy, peace child, anne frank, list is too long!)  Ender's Games  Tuesday's With Morrie  Of Mice and Men  Frankenstein  Some Edgar Allen Poe (he get's weird though)  Catch Me if you Can (autobiography and hilarious)  The first 3 harry potter books  hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy  The Crucible  Sherlock Holmes (my favorite!)|`|7iV0dIpGaa	TWILIGHT!!

I never like them with boring covers but I don't know why.|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	I agree with Kate, except that I'm a teen and I'm not like sheep. Yeah.  Right...o.o    Personally, I like to read classics and random, funny books. But then there are select few sort of....heavy books that I like. Normally I don't like *heavy* books because I don't want to be depressed by a book.    AKA, I love Hitchhiker's and I love Jane Austen [I actually like A Tale of Two Cities, a real shock to some of my friends who hate it]. But then I don't like books written in the modern day that are set in the ancient times. It kind of makes me uncomfortable.    I also kind of like what's popular, ie Harry Potter and the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants.     I like chick lit as long as it's obvious that it is and the author isn't trying to instil some deep meaning into it because he/she actually realizes there isn't any and if it's decently written [which is why I absolutely hate Twilight].    I'm a girl that likes happy, sappy endings. lol. As long as they aren't...you know....BAD.     And I actually like reading about Greek mythology, even though I believe that it is horribly idiotic. I actually enjoyed reading the Odyssey when I was forced to for school.     So basically, I like all sorts of things, mainly *light* reads because I don't like books that carry too much weight in my heart [I don't have time for mourning over characters or obsessing about what happens next..=.=] There are a couple 'deeper,' harsher books that I enjoy, though.    Edit: I saw another answer and that totally reminds me; I LOVE EDGAR ALLEN POE TO DEATH. That crazy alchoholic is AMAZING!!! So awesome. My favorite has to be either the Tell-Tale Heart or that one...can't remember............about the house..............-ponders-...  oh! The House of Usher. I actually laughed really hard as I read it. [I have twisted emotions, I know. I laugh a lot during horror movies because I can just think about how ridiculously hilarious everything is.]|`|FF9mMlgKaa	you mean you don't know?|`|tITPAbeKaa	i predict 95% of the answers are going to say twilight.    I'm not a teen so i can't answer your question with "just" my opinions.|`|U2wkJRrMaa	Most teenagers ar einto stupid crap like Twilight.    To the person who said everyone likes Twilight: NO, EVERYONE DOESN'T. You are not an advocate for the teenage people and you do NOT know what EVERYONE enjoys.

draNVjbkaa	Ignore dotcom's answer! It's irrelevant to an acting resume.    If you don't have a lot or ANY credits, just list your training and special skillls/abilities. That will show that you're still serious. Also, be CREATIVE with your Special Skills/Abilities section. When I was starting out, I had a lot of unique talents and the agents/cds would go straight there and have me demonstrate them and most of our interview would be about those things as opposed to lack of credits. NEVER put extra work!    An acting resume is also a three column format (/ represent Column breaks)    Film title/(Lead, Supporting, Featured)/Director    TV title/(Lead, co-star, guest star)/Network    Theatre title/Specific character name/(Production company or director depending on who's more prestigious)    Commericials  -List available upon request (ALWAYS put this. But do have a separate list with commercials and casting director involved.)    Training/School/Location    Special Skills/Abilities  Just have a creative list|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Include any training you have had, including the acting classes. Also include an objective - what you hope to accomplish in your acting career.|`|6DQSkKgWaa	Have you acted in class?  That counts!  In high school, at church, have you volunteered  for some community theater?  Even role play for historical reenactments.  These things hone your acting skills.  Just be careful who you are sending your information to, especially on the internet.|`|32525f208fb8107778c3825771c90726aa	Do a resume based on skills and personal successes rather than technical experience.  If you have some kind of Microsoft Word or Office it should help you create a resume of your choice if you go to New Task.  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|blfxu48Maa	BLUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    If you were in your third grade play and it has a name, add it! Add your acting classes. Some acting classes give performances with titles, add those. For example I took an Improve class at my local jr college, the improv troop had a name, " Av players" and I was in the show " Nice shoes, Wanna improve?" I have booth those listed.    ex : Member of the AV Players Improve Troop, was in improv show, " Nice shoes want to improv?, special skills: improv    That's one class three times on my resume, you have to stretch what you have and get creative. As you progress, you can narrow it down.     Rarely does any one ask for details, usually its," Oh you worked on a children's production of three little pigs, what was that like?" Response: It was great! I love working and performing for kids! They just get so into acting!

In addition, hopefully I can assit you in several types of resumes that all will work once you apply one of the suggestions in this reading.    I will explain several types of commonly used resumes, along with thier advantages and disadvantages.    In today's job market, the importance of your resume in your job search cannot be overstated.  Your resume should stand out and assure a prospective employer that you are a candidate he/she would like to know better --- and perhaps hire.  Many employers require a resume be sent as the first method of contact.  Your resume can be used to capture an employer's attention, even when no job is advertised.  More than a summary of your skills, experience and education, it is an advertisement of your best.  Your resume should make you stand out from the competition.    The use of electronic technology to manage the overwhelming number of resumes employers receive is increasing rapidly.  Today many companies and employment agencies are using scanners to enter resumes into a computer.  These resume scanning systems use varying degrees of artificial intelligence to screen the resume for desired skills.    Take the time to organize your job search information, including education, employment, and references.  Focus on your skills and accomplishments and look for ways to seek your qualifications.  A prospective employer does not just want to know where you worked, but also wants to know what you can do.     There are many types of resumes and many ways to format a resume - chronological, functional, profile skills-based, combination, one page, two pages - the choices are endless.  Your challenge is to choose the best type and format for your purposes.  You will evaluate a number of resume options and choose a format that suits your job search needs.     As you develop your resume, remember that you are selling a product, yourself, so you need the best advertising you can put together.  Also, keep in mind that you may have to try several resumes before you get one that works for you    PREPARING YOUR RESUME(S)    CHRONOLOGICAL:    This is the most widely accepted format because it is easiest to write and the one which employers are most familiar.  Jobs are listed in chronological order, starting with the most recent and working back through previous work history.      Use a chronological resume when:  - Your work experience, education and training are consistent and relate directly to your career goals  - The name of your last employer is important  - The names of the organizations where you have worked are impressive  - Your employment history shows growth and development towards your current career goal    ADVANTAGES:  - Interviewers are most familiar with this format  - It is the easiest to prepare since it  is structured with dates, organizations and titles  - A steady employment record is apparent  - Provides the interviewer with a guide for discussing work experience  - Your work experience, education and training are consistent      DISADVANTAGES:  - Reveals employment gaps  - May put undesired emphasis on jobs or aspects of jobs that you want to minimize  - Skills are difficult to spotlight unless they are reflected in the most recent job    FUNCTIONAL:    The functional resume is organized to highlight your skills, experience and accomplishments with little emphasis on employment history.    ADVANTAGES:  - Stresses skills, experience and accomplishments  - Helps camouflage a spotty employment history  - Emphasizes professional growth  - De-emphasizes positions unrelated to your current career goals    DISADVANTAGES:  - Many employers are suspicious of the functional resume and will request additional work history information  - Doesnt allow you to highlight organizations where you have been employed    COMBINATION    This resume is similar in format to the functional resume.  However, organization names and dates are listed in a separate section.    Use a combination resume when:  - Your work experience is unrelated to your objective - when changing careers  - Your work experience is with one employer  - Your work experience is with several employers, but the duties were similar  - You have gaps in employment history  - You are re-entering the job market after an absence  - You want to emphasize capabilities not used in recent work  - You want to emphasize capabilities used/developed through experiences other than paid employment  - You are entering the job market for the first time  - Your career growth has been poor  - You have had a number of unconnected work experiences  - You have changed jobs frequently  - Much of your work has been freelance or temporary    ADVANTAGES:  - The combination format emphasizes your strongest and most relevant skills and abilities, and at the same time, satisfies the employer's desire to know names and dates  - De-emphasizes gaps in employment  - Can be var

aLyJe1b3aa	...|`|AA10729675	I am sorry for your loss.  Especially your mother.  I have lost dear people too.  I personally think that they stay with us.  for as long as we need them, in a special way.  They are in our thoughts, in our heart, in our memory.  But they tell us things.  How?  Well, all of a sudden we get an idea that seems to come from nowhere.  We in fact would never have thought of this or that.  We have a renewed strength, or we appreciate something that we did not care about before.  Etc...  They wish good on us.  They protect us. The only condition for them to succeed in this endeavor is for us to keep an open mind and an open heart and to invite them (mentally, in our imagination) to come to us and to inspire us.  If we decide that no, we don't want them (if for instance they have been cruel to us) then, they truly vanish and disappear.  This is a personal opinion, but strong.    Now, about Heaven, I don't know.  About Purgatory and hell, I do not know.  I think that once they die, souls do not belong to our world with space and time, and greed, and all the rest.  And when they see that they have hurt us, but cannot do anything to fix the situation, that is their hell.  If they see that they made us happy, that is their heaven.|`|1Df04dWaaa	in heaven-a much better place|`|MNevmpQAaa	she's gone.  sorry but there is no afterlife.|`|jhjwYy8Daa	Ur mom is in u she's never left she will always b around when u look at yourself its her when you fell lonely she's there in ur mind letting you think bout the good old days so she's never gone just think of her in a better place|`|SwBYvHGqaa	I am sorry for the lost of your mon, your question remind me of lost of my mother.

g0lKlQGnaa	Animals DO indeed look different once you have seen a great deal of the same type.  I used to read alot about bears, and oddly enough, the more you see, the more you start to notice differences and subtle physical characteristics even within the exact same species    But of course it is not as easy at first because animals do not alter their natural appearance like humans do, i.e hairdos, makeup, clothing styles|`|qy07K2k5aa	Humans were created in the image of God.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	yes they do, we cant see the subtleties that make them different  we notice them on humans as we are humans  eyes are close together are farther apart or their jaw bone is higher or lower than yours  we cant see them but if you work with a species long enough  you learn to tell them apart|`|3ffb3b89c4d7e5f341def84b65cd6d10aa	humans have different breeds, like dogs|`|AA12151161	Animal do look very different.

Male Cardinals are RED, females are BROWN.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G That's the usual human delusion. Because you can't tell the difference, you think there is none. Crows know each other as individuals as do porpoise and otters and lions and...............|`|B7Vy3XJtaa	people may say many things but the main reason is =  It is the sign of God on every human .|`|q5IYgHmOaa	Have you ever looked at a picture of a bunch of guys in bootcamp. Because youre also a human you can see the subtle differences in their face structure and height, weight, and skin color. Other than that they look very similar. All the things people do to customize their looks (hairdo, makeup, clothes, etc...) make peoples' looks seem so much different when we're really very similar looking.|`|NVWUIn5Taa	Well i will sound too scientific on dt question....  I guess its a very big misconception dat animals look alike....coz its the genes of an organism which decide its physical features.....well i guess u knw d meaning of genes.....EVERY ORGANISM WHETHER ANIMAL OR HUMAN ARE ALL DIFFERENT EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES N DAT WHEN THE 2 PEOPLE ARE HOMOZYGOTIC TWINS.........FOR MORE INFO ON HOMOZYGOTIC TWINS REFER WIKIPEDIA|`|imzz3eqlaa	humans are genetically trained to do human face analysis, for mutual interactions which are generally NOT with animals.    we don't remember our days as the cavemen, but the lessons learned by our forefathers are still coded into our genes, the ones which give us the human instinct.    and they were definitely not interested in animal facial details, but in if they will be good meal.    however, some people can spot their beloved pets in a million.    and yes , another good reason is that animals do not have access to thousand types of garments, footwear, eye shades and hair saloons.

Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  I wouldn't call it a massacre.  A massacre implies killing of prisoners or total elimination of a force.  It seems that you're asking for examples of big defeats by small, vastly outnumbers forces.    2.  Finland is a very good example.  The only quible I'd have with it is that it wasn't a battle but a campaign (that took place over months in a variety of battlefields).      Here are my candidates (in order):  --Rorkes Drift:  139 British soldiers (many of them sick or rear echelon types) fight off 4-5,000 Zulu warriors that a few days earlier had anhiliated to a man a British force of over 1,000 troops at Isandlwana (while suffering fewer casualties than the British).  Rorkes' Drift is regarded as one of the finest tactical defenses in the history of warfare regardless of setting and nation.  11 British troops at Rorkes' Drift were awarded the Victoria Cross and another 8 were awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.  --Rommel's 7th Panzer (Ghost Division) during the attack into France.  Facing superior armor (the French Char-B was a better tank), his unit covered 150 miles in 1 day (an absolutely amazing feat), captured over 100,000 French and 450 tanks plus many more casualties against superior forces while suffering just under 2,500 casualties and 42 tanks lost in his division.  --Wonju (Twin Tunnels) in Korea, the defense by the "French Battalion" (consisting of mostly former French Foreign Legion volunteers) crippled the crack 125th PRA Division, including a bayonet charge by the French at one point.  An absolutely stunning fight that is rarely publicized because we like to think of the French as sissies or not fighters and the Korean War isn't much known anyway.  --Malaya and Singapore.  Yamashita with 65,000 covers a jungle-covered peninsula (Malaya), outmanuevers the British and inflicts 160,000 casualties (killed and POW) on the British and Australians in what is still regarded as the worst British defeat ever in their long history of warfare.  --Hougoumont (Waterloo).  The farmhouse ended up sucking in 12,000 French troops, never fell to the French and probably never held more than 2,000 combined forces of Prussian and British troops.  It consumed most of the French reserves, prevented any advance on the left by Napoleon (which was a big factor in the battle).  And if you study the battlefield, it looks nearly impossible to defend for more than a few hours at most.    By the way, I've made it a point not to include victories by smaller forces with far superior technology (like the British longbowmen at Agincourt).  At Rorkes' Drift, some of the Zulus had martinis picked up at their earlier victory.  At Twin Tunnels, the French did not have air support or extensive artillery to call in.  These were all cases of a smaller force, against a strong opponent with good weaponry defeating them with superior tactics and will.|`|AA11815233	The United States Army invaded Mexico in 1848, marched all the way to Mexico City and hoisted the stars and stripes over the Hall of Montezumas, despite being outnumbered by the Mexican forces 3 to 1.

The Brits were well armed yes, but outnumbered. The British command at the mission hospital was only 139 of which 35 were sick or wounded.    The Zulus numbered in the thousands and let's be fair they weren't exactly poor fighters, in fact they were probably the finest light infantry of the time. They were raised as warriors, fighting was what they did.  A few days earlier they had defeated the Brits at Isandhlwana simply by better tactics and overwhelming the garrison there.    The Brits held them off at Rorke's Drift for 17 dead and 10 seriously wounded....the Zulu dead were piled high all around...it was estimated that 10% of the Zulu army died in that one battle.    The rifles they had may have been good for the time but they were still bolt action, single shot with open sights.  With an effective range starting at about 200 yards that means you have about 30 seconds before the thousands charging you are on top of you.  You have to be able to put down a very concentrated rate of fire to hold those kinds of numbers back and of course you can't do that with so few men.    Maybe they were a little lucky I guess, all I know is it worked on the day.    11 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders at Rorke's Drift.|`|QusqTXCaaa	It is, of course, a myth that the longbow played a major role at Agincourt. The vast majority of the battle was a hand to hand mele.      According to historical records, the weather in the days leading up to the battle was torrential rain.  This turned the battlefield into a mud bath.      The French, all fresh and full of hubris opened the battle with a huge cavalry charge, a too huge cavalry charge.  Henry V used the terrain to his advantge by situating his army in a way that would cause the French cavalry to bunch up to a critical density.    He also planted wooden stakes into the ground, to help break the cavalry charge.  A combination of the terrain, mud, stakes, and yes arrows, caused the rear of the cavalry charge to crash into the front, sending the French ranks into chaos.    The French horsemen who survived this were either dismounted, or had to dismount to fight.  If you try to fight on a stationary horse, the men at arms on the ground will eventually kill the horse, then hack you to death as soon as you hit the ground.    If that didn't happen, then the horse will throw you off.  War horses were extremely temperamental and aggressive, they were only ever ridden in battle.  Most foot soldiers considered warhorses more dangerous than the man at arms or knight sitting on it.    Medieval cavalry charges were basically mad horse stampedes with men at arms and knights clinging on for grim life.  Once a cavalry charge was started, it usually took two or three miles to stop the horses, and turn them around. (Run Forrest, run!)    The French cavalry were wearing plate armour.  The English and Welsh bowmen were wearing chain mail and cloth.    The French plate armour was sucked into the mud, which greatly reduced their mobility.  Plate armour is heavy and cumbersome enough, but when you are having to pull your feet out of ankle deep mud, then every step you take increasingly becomes a draining herculean effort.  The cloth and mail clad English and Welsh did not have this problem.    The English and Welsh archers had joined their men at arms and descended on the French in hand to hand combat before the French could assemble any order, and the battle descended into one sided butchery.  Many of the Frenchmen in the thick of the battle were immobile, and defenceless.    The French lost at Agincourt because they had lost control of their own forces.  English archers certainly helped, but with hammers and bill hooks rather than arrows.    http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/45949,feat...
QmWNwHb5aa	Every couple of words i read a piece of me dies. There are multilple typos and a lack of grammar too.    Also haven't you ever heard 'show don't tell' yes its cliche but it still holds true. Also you need to know when to put detail in and when to leave it out for example your first paragraph SHOULD be:    I sat there with blood stained hands holding her eyes shut, her blonde hair fell across my hand. I could feel her eyes staring at me even though i couldn't see them beneathe my fingers. With her hands tied behind her back i laid her down on the bed. (which also how can be both be covering her face and still have enough strength in one hand to lay her on the bed/maneouver her body to the bed - remember physics when writing! even the physics of magic apply)    also something like brainwashing should actually take time - you dont just 'brainwash' someone. Each person does it differently, each story does it differently, you need to explain this.    You say too many things that have no meaning or should be told differently.    Also again don't tell us - show us! you say she looked like she had never smiled in her life - but what does that look like? explain it to us!    professional writers can start sentences with and sure - its not gramerical but sure, but you don't need to it makes no sense to begin your sentence with and - its a last resort not a first one.    This is very sloppy, i'm not trying to be mean i write professionally for a living. Remember specificity good, generality bad.    You can still be distinct and explain things well without giving it all away writers do it all the time.    As of yet it does not sound like something i would read, nor good. But thats what editing and brainstorming is for, good luck.|`|usvPMtMtaa	it's good yeah  just a little too jumpy. like stretch it out a bit|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	Sorry, not my type of reading material.|`|o1ibwPKPaa	I wouldn't read that...sorry!|`|XXc15qzzaa	it's sounding a little structureless.  Write an outline for plot. Then only write what moves the character's development forward or the plot forward. you should have a lot more in your head than will ever make it into the story. And it will be hard for a long time when you want to write everything. But this will help.|`|a796jDdlaa	I'm not sure if I'd read the whole book or not. But it sounds quite interesting!

Really as long as you give it some thought and write it from your mind and heart it will usually be really good. My teacher always says to be, "your a great writer, you should keep writing." So this is what Im passing to you! Keep it up, write a book or start a thread. (something I should do too) One thing my teacher really likes is when I describe something indepth and with lots of detail, which of course isnt good if you do this in everrry sentence. But here and there it makes it better. This was something you did very well.    Alright, Ill let you get back to your story. =D   Hope this helps and you get "positive" feedback for this, not stupid people that just want points.
ceBTTCPwaa	Pride and Prejudice, first published on 28 January 1813, is one of Jane Austen's novels, and is her second published novel. Its manuscript was initially written between 1796 and 1797 in Steventon, Hampshire, where Austen lived in the rectory. Called First Impressions, it was never published under that title, and in following revisions it was retitled Pride and Prejudice.    http://www.bookrags.com/Pride_and_Prejud...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/pap/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/prideandprejud...    http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/P...|`|RzbRRUOdaa	When Lydia eloped with Wickham, Elizabeth's hope for Darcy to propose marriage again died.|`|w2rUIrH2aa	umm i think its because when he came to longbourn with bingley he didn'y utter a word to her or look at her.     this is after lydia gets married    he seemed to not want to have anything to do with her in Elizabeths eyes but he was simply embarressed      but then we all know they end up getting married    yay LOL|`|suxCcXkAaa	I think it's after the whole Lydia/Wickham mess goes down.

You definitely know what you're writing about. There's just two things that bug me.    Firstly, the sentence structure for the second bit. A lot of it goes:  She did this did that. She did this did that. She did this did that. It's very repetitive and becomes slightly wearying after reading it for a while. So I suggest you do something about that.    And secondly, the last sentence. Technically there's nothing wrong with it. It's fine. I think it's just me, but I don't like it when authors switch perspective. I mean like for the first sentence it goes "to anyone...". But the last sentence it goes "you never..." To me, that's kind of switching perspective. As in, if you want to keep the "you" thing, it would be something like "if you pass by..." for the first sentence. Or if you don't want to keep the "you" thing, then the last sentence would go "Nobody would ever have guessed..."    But that's just me. :D    Yeah but anyway, it's a good beginning, and we can already start to see the personality of the characters. Good job!|`|daza5A4vaa	It was terrific (:  I'm really impressed.|`|GwFKW4Wsaa	It's easy to tell that J.K.Rowling has had an influence on your writing and personally i think thats great!! The short bit of this story is written very nicely, it does need a bit of editing and grammar work but i think it has great potential.    It sounds very much like Christina Aguilera's life story, maybe you should read her bio to get ideas!!!    Good luck|`|XXc15qzzaa	It's hard to tell with excerpts but your writing shows promise :)  What you need to do is write an outline for the plot. Even if you don't know where you're going it's important to have at least 1 skeleton for potential to give you an idea.  Then only write what movies the character development or the story's plot forward ( a lot harder than it sounds).  You're doing fine so far.   Good Luck!
QmWNwHb5aa	I'll start with a complement, among the short pieces of fiction i've read on here this is probably among the better ones - but it still could use some work.    I'm not trying to be harsh i write professionally for a living so i suppose i should know what i'm talking about.    Think of it this way as you write. Be there, imagine whats happening and explain everything. Now thing is i'm not a fan of extreme detail. I abhor the over-excess of it however in an instance like this wouldn't it be almost neccesary? Think about it - she's on edge right. When you're tensed and nervous and you're trying to escape or do something devious doesn't every little noise make you stand on edge, so that would add to the aura of whats going on - and then when she begins rushing to escape less detail, short sentences - pick up the pace.    Just a suggestion to actually get that emotion out to the reader so we can fully understand what she's going through. Basically - even though you're telling it in third person - explain it as though you were her and you were there. You need to understand each character fully and their motives to understand what they're going through, and she's your character so you should know her best.    Best of luck you have a story now give it heart.|`|YpmcXaNJaa	very very good. You are a good writer :)|`|FF9mMlgKaa	To be very honest there isn't enough here to tell if you are writing a good story or not. I mean if I had some context to put this in it would help. As for this segment nothing interesting or new is brought up. It is basically just a description of an event. Add some figurative language. What are the deepest thoughts brought to the characters mind? Those kind of considerations would set you apart from the rest.|`|a796jDdlaa	I think that's very interesting!

d1ylRSSCaa	I'm assuming you've already got a routine.     Number one rule: Make sure your in time with the music. Routines look best when there is synergy with the music.     2. Get a mirror and try and perfect your steps through the mirror. You should also get a video camera because what I've noticed is that more mistakes show up on film then watching yourself perform in a mirror.     Get a camera and dance through your routine. Be very picky. If you don't like something, adjust it. Sometimes adding a bit more movement into the move makes it much better. Other times you might want to scrap the set all together.     3. I know it sounds really corny, but have fun. When your performing take it really light hearted. People will enjoy your performance more if they know your enjoying it too. So do what you love best, and they'll love it too.     As for a good dance song, I really love Bonde do Role by Marina Gasolina. It's fun. Not 100% sure what type of dance your doing though.|`|G1OJNCF4aa	It's not so much about the routine than it is how you perform it. Make sure you are ALL together, and in sync! Take parts of other dance routines and add them together so they flow well.|`|nXojcf2Caa	the way you can create the best routine is if you let the music tell you what to do. if you just close your eyes and listen to the music, you should be able to hear certain moves or combos just fit with the music. if you can get the feel for a few combos, a tiny bit of repetition (in choruses) and a bit of filling in with other moves you like, you should end up with an awesome routine.    try listening to a bit of; teenagers in tokyo, bjork, or MIA to find some obscure songs to dance to.|`|7mGN5xU1aa	have plenty of bass    and when i make choreography i dont go with a full blow out, but fill it with surprises that sends chills down ppls spines
anmbQv0Saa	well you need to practice simple stretches every night and you will get more flexible from doing this. Here are some suggestions of good stretches to do:  1. Sit with your legs stretched out flat in front of you. Reach out and try to grab your feet or ankles.   Tip: Try and make your back as flat as possible to acheive maximum flexibility!  2. Sit with your legs in the straddle position. Reach out to the floor and try and touch your toes.  Tip: Try and keep your back flat as it will improve the quality of the stretch.  3. Sit with the soles of your feet together. Hold the soles of your feet and lower your back until your head touches the soles of your feet.  Tip: Get your knees as close to the ground as this will increase the flexibility of your hips.    Try and do these stretches every night and I promise you over time you will be able to touch your leg when it is raised like in that photograph.    Hope I helped   xxx|`|zJHrFBtNaa	Stretch every single day.

Try Yoga if you are into that.  I used to only be able to touch my toes too, now I can put my palms flat on the floor because each day when I was stretching, I'd hold a position with my fingers closer to the ground each time.  Hold certain stretched positions for at least a minute, doing deep breathing at the same time. (But don't stretch to the point where you are in pain)    You can also try Pilates.|`|EXisORX2aa	All you can do is stretch a lot. It'll elongate your muscles. Stretch every day, and after you exercise. Push yourself to stretch farther but not so it's painful... There's no overnight solution though. :)|`|AzdAvDW1aa	Just keep practicing, u no stretch everyday u can even have some1 push on your back so u go farther.|`|Dl9MJKf1aa	Well, you've started off quite nicely- at least you can stretch your toes. Make sure that you stretch every day though. Make a stretching routine. For example, stretch for 15 minutes in the morning right after you get up and again in the evening before you go to bed. Hold every stretch for about 30 seconds.   There's some videos on youtube that can help out like expertvillage (below are some others). Then you can set yourself small goals to achieve. Start with some easy ones and then you'll find that you're getting more flexible.  To do the stretch above, a good stretch is to sit on the floor with your legs out in front and try and reach your toes.  Then try on a surface above hip level- put your foot up and try and reach it with your hands.  Flexibility takes time and requires a lot of determination. If you are determined to achieve it, you'll see that it takes a shorter amount of time. Remember that some people are born with natural flexibility and others not. ;)|`|mpOKKyzOaa	I'm 13 too!

f595f51912c467d68eab3d0fedf6e468aa	What you think is good quality, what your boyfriend might think is good quality, and what I think is good quality may well be 3 different things. Therefore, whether it's $300 or $3000 doesn't mean a thing.    My advice is never ever buy a guitar for anyone. If your boyfriend is very serious about the guitar, then he should be the one to pick the guitar. Either give him a gift certificate to a local guitar shop or a check for $300 in case he wants to add some of his own money and get precisely what he wants from wherever he chooses.    Do not read me wrong though. I think what you are considering doing is a wonderful thing. He may be just dying to own a nice guitar and already has one picked out. He's just short about $300. This could mean the world to him, and I commend you for thinking of it.    Good luck!    Kabum

djmu98oUaa	Choosing a logo can be a difficult, complex task. Quality, fashion and purpose must be reflected in the logo design. These three points must be kept in mind to build a logo that serves your business. The motive of the logo is to represent a recognizable trademark without having to use the companys full name. A logo must be attractive and suitable for product for which it is designed.  1. Unique    The most appealing thing about a logo is its uniqueness and ease of recognition without the companys name. Logos of leading companies such as Versace and Armani are unique and recognized by people even if there is no sign on the product.       2. Strong and appealing   Logos must be strong and appealing so that the customer is influenced by it upon first sight. An example of this is the logo of Levis jeans; it represents the companys motive to provide strong jeans.       3. Must be suitable  The logo of a company must be suited to the product it is selling. For instance, if it is a sporting goods company, the logo should be related to sports. In this regard, color selection also matters. Colors like blue, red, yellow and green give a refreshing feeling and are said to be sport colors.|`|AA12339318	Keep it simple and make it personal.    For example, if a person, or company were named, say, "Avion," which, in Spanish, means "airplane," then the logo could logically relate to aviation.  Soomething as simple as a graphic representation of an airplane sillhouette, or a charicature of an airplane, or a propeller, or just the outline of an airplane tail assembly could make a good and recognizable logo.  One doesn't need the entire airplane and all its parts to help the viewer make the connection between the name and the graphic.    Or, if your interest was soccer, as in if you  had a true PASSION for soccer, then a soccer ball, or, even a PORTION of a soccer ball could make a good logo.    But the best logos don't require a lot of detail or fine lines to work.  In fact, such details could work AGAINST a corporate logo.  Thin, filligreed lines may work all right on a large sign, billboard or poster, but when the logo is reduced to the size to fit on a business card, or a telephone book ad, the detail gets lost, or worse, bleeds into other lines making a muddy mess, the detail is wasted.    Your initials MIGHT be incorporated into an image, but, in some cases, the initials alone work fine, as long as it is in an appropriate typeface, or a pleasing, logical arrangement.  The Yahoo logo, for instance is just a playful font in a loose, casual arrangement.  If that is the Yahoo corporate culture, then it is an appropriate logo.    Don't "over design" this piece.  If the design looks forced, then it will have less chance of working well.  Intricate, "Old English" letters, as an example, have very little to do with most high school students, so, even if the designer happens to LIKE Old English, it would be a poor choice for a logo. (an exeption would be if the person were named Bobby Knight.  THEN the Old English font for the B and the K could be the RIGHT choice)    It should take careful thought to create a good logo, so put some thought into yours before you begin to put anything down on paper.  Then, when you get a few ideas, start out by making a LOT of quick sketches of various ideas, instead of directly working on anything resembling a finished product.  It would be a shame to dig too deeply and invest a lot of time on a dead end design.  Gradually work your way to your finished idea.  Don't be afraid to abandon something that is just not working.    The end result should not be the idea that you spent the most time on.  It should be the BEST idea that works.|`|b7a385a1e0de49b6dbf85bbb11d3e42aaa	look around your house there are tons of logos around find one that you like and make it close i had to that in school myself i used my initials being pulled by a husky on a sleed|`|gjC2TB0zaa	Keep it simple! One colour (plus b&w if needed), and no patterns or drop shadows etc.  Play around with typefaces and the positioning of the letters and stuff like that.  Also, if you can think of a simple symbol or image that represents yourself, or that you like, incorporate it in the logo.    Just play around with it until you find something that works.|`|iH9HwlGvaa	Try and use reason when creating this logo. Most of the time you see that some logos are just graphic images. They do not convey any message and are poorly thought out. Just because a brand is small does not mean that their company logo design should be lousy.    Every logo design should have a goal. You might argue that every logo does, other wise why would people get a logo created in the first place. I agree with that. Goal here means a message. The message of the logo should be aimed at a specific section of the audience - the so called target market.     If your school already has a logo, which I hope they do unless they just started up, look at the current logo and ask yourself whether the logo truly represent your school. Does it communicate any thing at all? Is it right for the target market?    As for a text based logo, which seems to be the approach you are taking by wanting to play with the initials, often, all that is needed to created a distinctive text based logo is a simple alteration to a pre existing font.     Creating a text based logo can also mean utilizing the shape of the name itself to create an image. This is especially true when it comes to athletic sports teams.    Another way to approach the idea of text based logo is through the incorporation of graphics to either replace a letter or help showcase a specific section of the text.    The other route that is commonly used is when a graphic is located behind or integrated in such a way as to highlight certain letters. In the end, if the logo you create is truly effective, it will have:    ? Good recognition  ? Good descriptiveness  ? Good presence    Most importantly, good luck! :)
ceBTTCPwaa	Mazrim Taim (pronounced tah-EEM ) is a character in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time fantasy series. He is from Saldaea, in the Borderlands.    Taim has black hair, is above average in height with a dark face, tilted eyes, hooked nose and high cheekbones of a Saldaean. When introduced to Rand al'Thor he is judged to be around thirty-five, but Jordan has subsequently confirmed he is in his late twenties.   Taim can channel Saidin, the male half of the One Power and declared himself the Dragon Reborn. During the events which unfolded during The Great Hunt and when Rand al'Thor declared himself the true Dragon, Taim was thrown from his horse in battle and was captured by Aes Sedai. He escaped and now leads Rand al'Thor's male channelers, the Asha'man, and calls himself the M'Hael, which means Leader in the Old Tongue. He is notably arrogant, forgoing normal Asha'man ranking markers for blue-and-gold dragons on his coat sleeves, paying homage to Rand's arm markings while apparently mocking him at the same time.  Taim came to Rand in Caemlyn shortly after Rand announced an amnesty for men who could channel, carrying one of the seven seals on the Dark One's prison. He was pursued by Davram Bashere, who became one of Rand's highest generals. For all the speculations of his treachery, Taim turned the Black Tower from a small farmhouse with around a dozen men into the powerhouse of the One Power that it is.  In Knife of Dreams, Taim met with the White Tower Aes Sedai and agreed to allow the bonding of Asha'man by sisters of the Red Ajah. His justification for this was to "Let the Lord of Chaos rule," a phrase unknown outside the circle of the Forsaken and high-ranking Darkfriends.  Logain claims that Taim has a small sect of followers, most likely Darkfriends as well, whom he personally teaches weaves that no other Asha'man know. Taim refuses to believe that Rand was responsible for the cleansing of saidin.  Taim is a very power-hungry individual, as evidenced by his claim to be the Dragon Reborn. He is spiteful of those more powerful than he, but is willing to become their underling if in exchange for a position of his choosing. This is what led to his dissension with Rand. He seems at first very willing to be second to Rand, but with a title and power of his own choosing, which Rand is unwilling to allow. Taim first begins to resent Rand when he places him in the farm, from which the Black Tower would spring, to teach commoners who sought to learn to channel, instead of allowing him to stay by Rand's side. When Rand confers upon him the title of Asha'man, he is clearly unhappy about being seen as second to him, and after that day never wears the black garb of Asha'man, nor the Sword pin of the Dedicated or the Dragon pin of the Asha'man, instead electing garments adorned on the sleeves with Dragons, to make himself seem equal to Rand. The two are at silent war with each other: Rand is unable to kill him despite his treacheries because he is holding the Black Tower together for him to use at Tarmon Gai'don, while Taim cannot risk trying to kill Rand personally because Rand is more powerful than he, and any open action against him could turn Asha'man who are loyal to Rand against him.  He is very powerful in the Power, but it is not known just how strong he is. Initially he is far more experienced in using the One Power than Rand which means he has a certain advantage there, even if they are otherwise pretty much matched in talent. In Lord of Chaos, Rand tells him to seize as much of the Power he can. Taim seizes the Power and Rand sees that he holds almost as much as Rand is able to. However, Rand doesn't detect any evidence of strain on Taim's part, which causes Rand to suspect Taim is more powerful than he lets on.
2UtkBvvvaa	Goood on you =)  1) It is possible, but you would have to work extremely hard, be motivated, practice every day, and also have natural talent.  2) Depends what classes you are taking? If you are doing classical ballet, then yes you are taking the right classes, if you are doing Hip-Hop or Crumping, then no =D  A private studio would be a good idea, I would highly recommend it.  3) Depending on how good you want to get, but probably at least a few months to learn the basics, and then a year to be able to get good. This also depends on what I mentioned in 1).  I hope I helped you. =)  By the way, I'm 16 years old, and have done classical ballet (Among other genres) Since the age of four. I did pointe for two years, and actually would not reccommend it at all.  It ruins your feet, toes and back, I know a lot of dancers who have ruined their bodies because of it.  However, I am not trying to put you off pointe, I am just warning you of the consequences.  Good luck, and all the best =D|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Careful!   Follow your dreams, however; you need all your extremities functioning properly if you wish to continue your dance studies. You don't have the time to sustain an injury which may be a sudden accident or turn into a chronic pain issue that you will be dealing with for the rest of your entire life.    I personally enjoy the creative process involved in contemporary dance training and choreography for those who have not engaged in training to dance the classic's  from an early age.  Have a professional (who has taken the responsibility of training dancer's to work on ponte) assess your technical abilities and listen to them with regard to your abilites and if you should continue this form of dance training.    Remember you must find an "objective professional who has trained dancer to work on ponte".     Injuries can ruin opportunities that may come to you as a dancer that do not demand Ponte work!|`|dnoykOX8aa	Not at all there are people a lot older than you leaning pointe or still Dancing pointe.

First yes anythings possible if you really put ur mind to it, second if your really interested and want to do anything with ballet/dance as a career then yes go and have private lessons , if u want to do pointe work it will take you a few years because u have to build up strength in your ankles, legs and toes. DO NOT try to do pointe work if you only have 1 year or less experiance with doing "flat shoes" ballet... i had to wait 8 years to do pointe work because i wanted to have really strong feet and legs now i do so it really paid off for me.. i recommend you do feet strengthening exercises every day as much as your can, do as much physical/dance activity as you can but yeah i hope i helped you out :) all the best for you DO YOUR BEST !!!

One contribution was the know how to built the log cabin. That tech became basic is the settlement of the North American continent.|`|EI4fmPnoaa	When I teach my U.S. survey class, I always start with the Spanish at St. Augustine. Most come out of high school knowing about Columbus in the Caribbean and Cortes in Mexico, and maybe even know a little something about New Mexico. But most don't realize the first European colony on the Atlantic coast was also founded by the Spaniards, in 1565.    I then tell them about the French and Portuguese sailors who fished the North Atlantic and established semi-permanent camps (it's hard to say whether these really qualify as "colonies" per se, but that's where most of your early fur trade began. Jacques Cartier and Henry Hudson both wrote in their journals about Native Americans standing on the shore and waving furs -- indicating this is something they were used to doing before even these earliest explorers arrived.    The French founded Acadia and Quebec, the English founded Virginia, and the Dutch founded New Holland all pretty much for economic reasons.  One of the previous commenters said Philadelphia was originally Swedish. This is partly true, but misleading. Actually, it was present-day Delaware that was New Sweden. And even though it was chartered by the Swedish king, the founder was the former governor of New Holland who had been fired by the Dutch and was looking for a new job. Most of his investors were Dutch.    The English Puritans and Pilgrims (they were two different groups, who came at two different times to two different places) were a little odd, in that they weren't just looking to make money. Sure, they were as interested in commerce as the others, and some of them became rather wealthy. But that wasn't their main motivation.  There's a lot of material on them.    Also, most people forget the Russians, who colonized what is now Alaska, and once laid claim to everything down to Northern California. (Look up the Nootka Crisis for more on that.)    And also don't forget the Vikings, who came a good 500 years before everybody else, but didn't publicize it the way the Spaniards did.    The Portuguese didn't do much in North America, but were active colonizers in South America.    Germany and Italy didn't colonize the Americas themselves (because there was no such thing as a Germany or an Italy until the 19th century -- they were part of other kingdoms until then) but Germans and Italians came to the New World in droves. Germans tended to come to the English colonies, while Italians -- at least at first -- came primarily to the Spanish ones.    Let's see, Who have I left out? Oh, yeah! The Irish (and the Scots), who also came to the English colonies (Ireland was a conquered territory of England during most of this time, and England and Scotland didn't unite to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain until 1707.)    Below are some links.    Good luck.|`|AA11526235	A group of Germans emigrated to Texas and founded Frerericksburg in the 1800s.

Look for the word "Chinese." Read.    You could also do this for any number of other groups, but you'll probably find the most material on the Chinese "coolies" who were brought in, because they'd work even cheaper than the newly-freed blacks.    Although, the "exodusters" (free blacks escaping the south to settle in Kansas and Oklahoma) are an interesting case, and there should be plenty of information about them, as well.    You could also write about the Scandanavian immigrants who settled Minnesota and the Dakotas. Or the Irish, who helped build the railroads. Or the Slavic miners.    Hispanics were already there. So were the Native Americans. But I don't know what your teacher/professor is asking for, so they might be fair game, as well.    Anyway, those are some starting points. Hope that helps.    Good luck.|`|AA11526235	Soldiers who served during the war often came back to nothing because their farms, their relatives and their money were all gone.  To get West, they either reenlisted in the army to fight the Indian Wars or they drifted West in ones and twos because they couldn't even afford to join a wagon train.  These drifters could get odd jobs to work their way west until they found a place they wanted to settle, but many of them died of starvation, were killed by other drifters for whatever possessions they had, or maybe killed by an occasional Indian, though not as often as in the old westerns.  Sickness was another problem caused by lack of funds for food and medicines, bad water, and the occasional wild animal.  Some got to the west and became cowboys for ranchers who had settled there earlier and working conditions were hard--long hours, low pay, stampedes and accidents, and thieves--rustlers, were some of the problems they faced.  On top of that, there was still a lot of bitterness left over from the war.  That should be enough to get you started.
MbaP0u6iaa	Nobody got knighted (which is the only way anybody acquires the title "Sir" in Tasmania itself, because the Australian Honours system only dates from 1975. Before that any Tasmanian would have been knighted by the king/queen of the day within the British honours system, and the honour would have been announced officially in the London Gazette. You can search that online. Also, Wikipedia has a list of living Australian Knights and Dames (the female equivalent of Knights).    Filtering out Tasmanians from those sources may take some legwork on your part, I'm afraid.
Clt9uTmNaa	When I first went to college, I had my heart set on working for Dreamworks, or Pixar.  It's everyone's dream who goes into computer animation to work for a great big company like that.  Unfortunately, there are few people that will ever get that great position.  The amount of talent that it takes to get into there is out of this world.  Furthermore, you will need to have a lot of experience usually.  To be a computer animator, you will need to study human anatomy, and study exactly how we move.  It's extremely hard, and unfortunately is a dream that most do not achieve.  You will have to work very long hours, often weekends and holidays, and expect to have no life other than work.  Might I also mention, if you wait until you're 26ish, you'll be behind in the game really.    It is possible for you to study in the USA.  I would suggest contacting schools in the US that you're interested in, and they can give you the proper information on how to get there.  They can also give you information on getting school loans.    Each program has a different cost.  If you go to a really good school, expect to pay a lot of money.  Also, when considering the cost of the school, you will also have to consider the cost of living expenses.  A lot of big entertainment schools are in big cities that tend to cost a lot to live there.    I only know a few animation schools off hand.  I will list them below in sources.  Check out their websites and give them a call.  You should really try to go to school sooner than 26 though.  Also I know when I was taking animation classes in school, a really great book was "The Animator's Survival Kit" by Richard Williams.  Although it has nothing in there about how to animate in 3D, what it does do is teach you the basics of animation, and how the body works.|`|AA12339318	Here's some information from the Pixar studios:    http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/jobs/in...

Some ideas for research as far as World views (which is what I think your' really looking for) are pretty easy to come by.    There is (VERY broadly speaking) two categories when speaking about people's take on World Views...    The first is Conventional Wisdom, and being impressed upon in a traditionalist fashion. (i.e Confucius' followers, Christians and Jesus, Buddhists and Buddha, their values/ ideas etc... some people's idea of wisdom mainly stem from ancient wisdom).     Again I remind you this is very broad spectrum.    The second is a mixed wisdom, on one hand there is the theory of no original experience; in which it is argued that any experience we might have is not completely new (or never before experienced),   so to one degree the idea of Wisdom is not only seen as in some way interpretable (because they personally believe no one has gotten "Wisdom" completely right yet).   In another degree a person can basically have no new experience of certain emotions etc...that someone hasn't already had sometime in the past so they see the world in a more "liberal" sense. (AKA Mixed Wisdom)    Try to think about/ focus on more than one idea or World View there is no shame in exploring ideas, try looking up theories of human nature at the library (theists all the way to scientific evolutionists and pantheism etc....) there is a plethora of knowledge out there we just need to know how to obtain it.

XvO4iLk0aa	G The LDK works.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	My life is not in my control, the parts i think i have authority on are just false images and mirages that give me credit to this illusion.

lp9dBT6paa	I read a few books on the matter. The roman emperor is only one guy and the empire is huge. its also huger than it seems on the map because messages take so long to get to him. There is a bureaucracy but its still slow. The emperor himself would be either on the Rhine for the west empire or around Antioch for the east. thats why the empire split in the first place, it was too big to be governed effectively from one point, and it remained too big. the frontiers were well guarded but the whole system depended on there being one or a few barbarian penetrations so the mobile parts of the army could be set in motion. the emperor would have to rely on sketchy and incomplete information to make the decision to move, and it could be the wrong one. Apart from the logistics, he would have to deal with making both the army and the people happy (Machiavelli spends some time talking about this in the prince). the problem with doing that is the fact that after the pax romana there is no more large scale loot to do the triumphal parades and games with. A large section of the army is demobilized and is designated as frontier guards. the remaining mobile forces can now move around and thats a problem because the emperor would have to keep their generals happy. the problem was that after the julio-claudians were gone, the only thing that made one a legitimate emperor was the ability to get the army on his side. thats a problem for a current emperor because he has to maintain a monopoly on that. the biggest problem was the lack of able men to do that. the person would have to be charismatic to deal with the army effectively while wise to see the tactical situation and a little paranoid to avoid assassins, populist to keep the people happy, later devout to Christianity, just to name a few. He would also have to face invasions or threats of invasions by the Sassanid Empire on a very long front. in one word, its huge, too huge for one center. also keep in mind the fact that not all land produced the same revenue. the big eco centers were North Africa (there is a reason why the Carthaginians lived there), Syria, Egypt, some Greece and Spain. the rest, such as Gaul, was a buffer to keep out the barbarians and recruit and support the armies. the roman emperor would have to deal with the size of his domain, with the enemies on all sides, with his own army and with his own people, with his own family and friends to keep his life, with economical matters so he can pay for the army and such. he would also have to address matters of religion as the pontifix maximus. and he would sometimes also have to directly lead the armies. my thesis is simple. to be an emperor who was not assassinated in a matter of months one would have to be simply awesome at all of the above, or designate authority. the problem with that is rebellion, and the emperor is not protected by any divine mandate and the populace is rather lazy.|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	Guarding the border and macromanagement as a whole off the top of my head.|`|fyXCunCSaa	Economy.

Bh6Bgzhoaa	Depends which ones you are talking about.  Some were sent by England just like the colonists that England sent to dozens of other countries.  The Pilgrims went because they felt like the church of England was too lax and too similar to the Catholics.  Hundreds of people were sent to the colonies because they had committed crimes and were not allowed in the motherland for a certain number of years.  There were also Spanish colonies, French Colonies, Portuguese Colonies and so on, the English just drove a lot of them out.  the English Colonists were not leaving so they could stop being Englishmen, they were leaving because they thought it was a good business idea for the most part.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	When Queen Elizabeth 1 came to the throne, England was in political, social, economic turmoil. Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII, was excommuicated from the Catholic Church. While Catholics were protected under Edward VI and Queen Mary, protestants and other non-catholics were persecuted. When Elizabeth came to the throne, the tables turned and it was the Catholics on the backfoot.    Henry VIII left the English economy in a mess. Wars with france and Spain and the constant devaluation of the currency, led to English exports being almost worthless in Europe in the main markets of Antwerp. With hard economic times came rampant crime and social problems.    What started the ball rolling was the English war against Spain -English merchants - facing tough economic times - turned towards piracy against Spanish gold ships returning from America. Sometimes supported by the English nobility as well as the Queen, English pirates such as Francis Drake went so far as to raid spanish colonies in the Americas as well as the Carribean.    The profits to be made in the new world opened up the doors to colonies, which would grow items such as tobacco - cash crops which could be sold in England as well as Europe. There was no lack of colonists due to the problems back home - people fleeing religious persecution as wel as social and economic problems.     English colonists were joined by other Europeans fleeing religious persecution and the constant wars between the Catholic and Protestant powers.

u23sua9daa	The Articles of Confederation was the document that organized a perpetual Union among the 13 states that had declared independence from Great Britain. The Articles were in effect between March 1, 1781, and March 4, 1789, when they were superseded by the Constitution of the United States of America.    The Articles set up a national legislature that could raise an army and navy, declare war and negotiate treaties, borrow and coin money, run a postal system, and handle relations with Native Americans. Each state could send two delegates to Congress but had only one vote. Delegates from 7 of the 13 states had to be present to establish a quorum and conduct business. Delegates were elected for one-year terms and could not serve for more than three years in any six-year period.    The single-body Congress under the Articles of Confederation comprised the entire national government. There was neither an executive nor a judicial branch. In fact, in November 1777 the draft of the Articles that the Continental Congress submitted to the states for ratification specifically rejected a plan for an executive proposed by James Dickinson and the Committee of Thirteen the year before. The Dickinson draft would have provided for a Council of State appointed by Congress and for other officers for managing the general affairs of the United States." The council would have exercised broad powers: command of the military, administration of finances and diplomacy, and the Execution of such Measures as may be resolved on by the United States."    The Articles of Confederation provided instead for a Committee of States to execute in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of Congress as the United States, in Congress assembled, shall by the consent of nine states, from time to time, think expedient to vest them with." The committee could not exercise military, diplomatic, or fiscal powers or make any decisions to which the Articles required the assent of nine states.    Under the Articles, the president of the Continental Congress was simply the presiding officer of the legislature and had no executive functions. The importance of the office can best be understood by the fact that in the absence of the president, a clerk was designated to perform his duties. Presidents served one-year terms, and they were usually men whose talents matched their limited powers.    Beginning in 1776, ad hoc or permanent congressional committees, supplemented by boards of officials operating under their direction, performed administrative duties. The Marine Committee dealt with the navy, the Board of War and Ordnance with the army, and the Committee of Secret Correspondence handled diplomacy. By 1781 several departments were created, among them Foreign Affairs, War, Marine, and Treasury, each with a single head. Neither the president of the Congress nor the Committee of States supervised these officials.

OdN55phmaa	Before I answer, I just like to say that I love your choice in novels and authors. Maybe you could add a Michael Connelly book to the list as well; I recommend The Black Echo - but be warned, his novels are very addictive. Love 'em.    O.k. Well, I think that you should read either The Green Mile by Stephen King or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. They're both incredible in their own special way.     Enjoy your books!   :)|`|6DQSkKgWaa	A truly inspirational and true story is Christy by Catherine Marshall.    Pretty much all of Nicholas Sparks books are inspirational.  My favorite was A Walk to Remember.  They do tend to have the same type of storyline after awhile, though.    If you are going to read The Lord of the Rings, start with The Hobbit    For Stephen King  Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is a great story and movie.As is The Green Mile.  Read his short story book called Four Seasons.  I liked Bag of Bones.    A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving  John Grisham's The Street Lawyer and The Testament  Amy Tan has some great books.  The Eye of the Needle by Ken Follett    I love the Tom Clancy books with Jack Ryan as the hero.  My favorite was The Sum of All Fears, but you will probably want to read them in order so that you can really get into the Jack Ryan character.  By the way, they were not published in the chronological order of Jack Ryan's life.    The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro    Some oldies but goodies are  Jane Eyre  Sense and Sensibility  Pride and Prejudice  Within Heaven's Gates by Rebecca Springer  The Hours Before Dawn by Celia Fremlin    For medieval fun that I enjoy as much as my daughter try  Catherine, Called Birdy  The Midwife's Apprentice  Matilda Bone  all by Karen Cushman|`|RzbRRUOdaa	Try any of these:    The Pillars of the Earth, Ken Follet  World Without End, Ken Follet  Honor Among Thieves, Jeffrey Archer  Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less, Jeffrey Archer|`|bM9Y79wHaa	Angels and demons is REALLY good.

Then maybe give Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series a try, starting with The Wizards First Rule.  A little Robert Jordan if you still like high fantasy after Tolkien and Goodkind.  By all means find some Charles Dickens and Mark Twain.  If you get hungry for suspense or action look up Daniel Silva.    Fiction is the product of a actively wandering mind.  Find a train of thought that interests you and chase it down and if it bores you give it up for another.

You could try Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen - about a young man who joins the circus in the depression.  I couldn't put this down and read it in a mega reading session!

dM5a6Pm7aa	The costumes are bland, expressionless, and everyone wears the same thing.  this shows the theme of conforming to society, and not showing any unique thought. How everyone is expected to the same and not stand out.  the covered, maid-like work dresses that the girls wear show the degregation of women and the taboo of their sexuality (especially in the strict religious society). As an example of this, think of the shock that Abigails uncle feels when he sees someone naked in the forest during the ritual at the beginning. Seeing that confirms his thoughts that their actions were un-godly e.g. covered up is pious).   They wear very conservative, long dresses, and aprons. The aprons show the fact that women work in the house, and that the genders have seperate and clear roles in society. men wear sturdy work clothes, as they plough in the fields and work hard as good christian men should.  note that the colours of the women's clothes are also very bland, again to not be unique and just 'blend in'  hope this helps

XvO4iLk0aa	G How about you healing yourself with professional help. There is a way to enhance the placebo effect and the utility of professional medicine. it is calle the LDK. Numerous people on YA have reported to me that it has helped them greatly.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|slHUNl58aa	I think you need some real help from a professional, you sound manic, paranoid and delusional.

As I grew I began to feel a slight constant pain in my back that me and my family attributed to growing pains.   When I was in my 2nd year of highschool the pain began to get worse and I began to fear that It would never stop. After joining a cross-country running team I began to feel an almost constant sensation that I had been hit by a car. The pain was literally that bad. I called it as my being "out of shape" but I was always muscular and was certainly not carrying too much weight anyway since I weighed only 115-120. And I'd never heard anyone complain about their pain being that bad from being out of shape.  Now I am an adult the pain has appeared to have settled and stopped it's worsening. At worst, I can't breathe or make a sound, at best the pain is annoying since I can't pick up anything heavier than my purse (which pushes it sometimes depending on how long I carry it).    As I'm sure you know doctor's don't always care very much, and I only just met one who does and can help me 3 years after the pain has reached it's peak. (we found out last tuesday that I can get better after discovering bone and disc malformations. the discs are burrowing into the spine).    There was a time when no one but my mom believed me. That being the case I thought I was losing my mind and she was just being a mom trying to protect me with her trust. My family and people I knew thought I was seeking attention because there were years of tests coming back negative for anything.  There was a time where we were sure that I had this disease (w/ a really long name) that would kill me within a few years. There were many different things it could have been.  Knowing that I would probably live with the pain the rest of my life was too much. I wanted to be a wife and a mother. But how could I when I was in too much pain to be hugged and too weak to hold my own child?  I wanted to die. What stopped me was I had always considered suicide weakness and cowardice and I was afraid that I would fail an attempt to end my life and I would be in deeper than I'd begun. And I didn't want to make God angry with me so I kept that to myself until just last week. A friend of my brother killed himself two weeks ago. He'd been on some medications and his girlfriend broke it off with him and he'd had enough.     I truly believe that "all things work together for good for those who love God..." (Romans 8:28).   I don't believe God caused this pain, but I believe he can use mine, and your, life story's to help others. There are so many people living lives that are suppressed. God showed me a little girl with cerebral pulsy who could only move her eyes and eat (with help). After surgery a few months ago, the doctor messed up and now she is no longer allowed to eat except through a feeding tube. Her favorite foods are spaghetti and ice cream. She is 7 years old.     When I am afraid, God gives me a peace that passes ALL understanding. There is no reason for me to feel at peace with my life and most of the time I don't. But when I want His help, He doesn't dissapoint. (except when I don't like His answer, but that's my problem :P)  If God created man to bless Himself, then I choose to bless Him as best I can (which I fail at on a daily basis) and I know He will be so happy to see me when the time comes (His time of course) when I will be physically a new creation. Right now all I am supposed to focus on is what a gift I have to be able to say I have Him, who created so much perfection, loving me despite my imperfections.   My words alone mean nothing, but Him through me might make a difference. That is what I believe happened with you. God used you.

1TPGdaXJaa	As many have said, your best bet may be to keep your job and pursue other education through evening courses, if seeking a new job is what you want.      I went down this path for a while, and while I still desire a new line of work, I realized what I was missing even more was a balance in my life. I found pursuing other avenues, mentally & spiritually (meditation / philosophy studies through groups and classes), physically (gym, yoga, and outdoor activities in the summer), and creatively (learning various forms of art and design - for me, writing and digital technologies).     Although I still battle with the fact that I must spend so much of my time at work, I feel I am now bettering myself on a more complete level - the mental and spiritual side of me helps me to embrace what I do for work and in everything else and let go of my self-created frustrations, the physical activities give me greater energy and an overall happier feeling in everything I do, and the creative activities I pursue have helped me to learn new things - but things that I truly enjoy for what they are instead of learning them to make more $. These things dont end the struggle and suffering, but they have made an exponentially profound difference in happiness, approach, and perception to daily life.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Use the LDK to find out what you really want and to get it.

He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

ai33g11Maa	In terms of form, it is okay - apart from line 3 - should be mind's not minds.  But, it appears far too teenage angsty, and bitter.  I do not like the sentiment 'love is just lust in disguise' - this belittles the emotion we all pay homage to so often.  It feels like you are exorcising all of your emotional bitterness, and it does not make a reader warm to the poem, or to the writer.|`|zyoGZ3sxaa	hay.

Anyways, 'Time heals all wounds', though it mind not to the scars.     In terms of poetry, it isn't too bad, but it's more of a list and is a TAD too angst-y. Anyways, good luck with poetry and life!|`|D2g0XSLTaa	I think it is good.  I have absolutely no criticism which is not like me.|`|OkBG2lBmaa	I don't like it. Love isn't just lust in disguise and nothing in your poem convinces me otherwise. I mean the poem works great overall but if love was just lust would you feel all those emotions when things go awry? Well, I can only suggest that I don't think you would. You fall out of lust you suddenly see someone as normal rather than an idealised image of that person. You move on. Everything in between the first two and last two lines works well but I don't believe it because of those 4 lines.|`|ANjDFgREaa	I've got to agree with XJING about the poetry part. It feels a bit like listing, and for such a deep hurt, it's surprisingly impersonal. You can't simply pronounce that love is bull**** in a poem without building up a narrative around some real experience to which your readers can relate.     "I can't this" and "I can't that" gets to be a bit blah-blah BUT, if you want to read a poem by someone who got away with just that gloriously, I recommend "The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock" by T.S. Eliot. Talk about angst. And over 130 lines of it.     If this is just venting, we've all been there some time. These things pass.     Good Luck.     PS I was just re-reading it.   There are two lines in there that I think are interesting in the 4th stanza:   A loss of trust                  (1)  The need to breathe       (4)   This could make an very interesting juxtaposition around which to build a poem: the idea of suffocation as a way to describe a relationship where trust has failed.
AA11601527	Hobbes didn't believe that men where evil,rather he thought that they where self interested, rational and roughly equal in physical ability and this meant that the most rational ways of behaving would always lead to war between two people. In the state of nature terms like Good and Evil couldn't really apply.    In contrast Rousseau believed that men where good but he means something rather different to what we mean. He meant mainly that they where self sufficient and well adapted to their surroundings.    However you are right in saying that both believe that society shaped how men are now.|`|1243f4e8337cd349f01721fab2d47a02aa	I think Hobbes would say that men are selfish in a state of nature and in society they are still selfish, but refrain  themselves because of fear of being punished by the State.

ajeMVARraa	You can go on a website like fictionpress.com and look for a beta reader if you don't know anyone who is willing to read for you.  Also, try reading your work outloud. Sometimes hearing it will help you decide if something needs to be changed. And if you get hung up in any spots because the writing is confusing, you will know to revise it. Good luck.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Make multiple revisions to any work and wait at least a day before you go back and make a revision. After first writing something it's easy to gloss over glaring mistakes and shoddy writing, but after a little time away it's much easier to read it objectively, like it was someone elses work.|`|CVxfiz4Naa	The best advice I have is on my website: www.bkedits.com    If you can find a writers' group, you may be able to get helpful criticism.      The single most common error is described in detail in Jack M. Bickham's book, Writing Novels That Sell.  In brief (but Bickham put it better), you have to write things in the order they occur, and the stimulus has to be -immediately- before the response.  You don't write, "He ducked as she threw the pot," or, "She threw the pot.  Her biceps was like a boxer's.  He ducked."  You write, "She threw the pot.  He ducked."    That's because you only have black marks on a white page with which to draw your picture, and the reader is very, very easily lost.    www.bkedits.com|`|IIa4efh5aa	The biggest flaws to look for would be holes in the plot. If the only way your story can resolve itself is for your previously brilliant protagonist to do something stupid, revisions are needed.    How about dialogue? Does it ring true for the setting and the character or does it seem forced and stilted? Do your characters babble on in long expository declamations, or do you reveal information to the reader through a compelling narrative?    Word choice. Do your descriptions create a real sense of person and place? There's a difference between a woman wearing a green gown and a woman wearing a moss-colored gown.|`|ikMOb6gcaa	Details first:  Why will nobody read the first drafts?  Are they too close to you, maybe don't want to take the chance of hurting your feelings if they have negative (yet intended to be helpful) remarks?  Can you find someone disconnected a bit, yet close enough so that their remarks mean something to you?  By the way, I think that if your writing is *good* you know it already -- your question sounds like it's trying to say "how do you know if your writing is sellable?" (lol), and that's a fair question as well (speaking as someone who has every intention of making a living writing, that's crossed my mind many times -- the difference between "good" and "sellable").  Disturbing question, no?    OK, back to the original question, that of finding flaws.  I'm going to assume you refer to a novel, or fiction in any case.  First thing: are your characters believable?  If not, why not?  Of course, superheroes (for example) can't be entirely *believable* but in the correct context, no problem.  If your characters change in any way (and they probably should), is the transition easy to follow?    This is difficult for me -- I try to catch problems as I go -- maybe that's my biggest problem, lol.  I admittedly don't do a lot of revising AFTER I've come to the end of the story . . . and my characters tend to do a lot of writing for me, if you know what I mean.  I've had stories change direction b/c one of the characters wanted to do something other than I had planned.    If you're an outliner based on a plot outline, then you have to make your characters follow that plotline.  AND they have to have a reason for that, to make them believable.  If your characters make sense, so will the story.    I know, different writers do different things.  I'm sure there are wildly successful writers who focus on plot or tone more than characters -- and I probably don't read their books . . .     Good luck!|`|e29d291d74030bb5aef86377b273cd5faa	Well I know that from personal experience that I am the worst critic of my own work, but I wont have anyone read it other than me!!

I looked at your images and while the lighting is nice, they are all very one dimensional.    Schooling would help, but does it necessarily have to be a fashion school in NY?  Probably not.

If you can find a part time job working with a minor Fashion photographer, you can put what you learn in school to practical use and it might help you excel through the program and help keep the cost down.    For answering the questions, most of the answers are from having experience in doing many of the fields many of us have experimented in. Some of us just enjoy taking photos to the extreme in some cases. Google helps a lot to find the links and doing a lot of reading broadens our knowledge.    I hope this will help with your decision on schooling and about answering question.|`|J1AIXy5Faa	If you got accepted to a fashion photograph school in New York in the first place, then I'm sure you have to have some talent. I don't know much about photography ... but your photos look pretty.
F7HT7glPaa	MORANA  Means "death" in Slavic. In Slavic mythology this was the name of the goddess of winter and death.    VALDS  Derived from Old Norse valr "the dead" and ds "goddess".      I don't really like either of these (it was hard to find names relating to death) but maybe you could change them around a bit; make the name sound nicer. You could even join both names to make Valmorana, which would mean Dead Goddess of Winter, or something alone those lines.|`|dGfwUBMiaa	Vita is often assossiated with death in latin.|`|ugiUyhOwaa	?Tears|`|GwFKW4Wsaa	www.babynames.com    Plenty of names and they have the meaning and origin    "mort" means death|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	hoe about honey, or liah or andy, or mellie,or bell?|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	Kali but I think it has been used often.

I was a little unclear about the first two lines in the second stanza because you don't clue us in on exactly what it is that you wanted that gets ignored by your mum. I liked the third stanza best because it was really clear, although you could have used a stronger verb than "Looking" like "Glaring" or "Snarling" which would help both to emphasize your dread and further describe why your cousin's a ****.

Try typing in 'Birmingham Talent Agency' or 'UK Talent Agency' into Google.|`|S01zIagOaa	The entertainment industry in the U.K. is much smaller than it is here in the U.S., hence the many established and not so established U.K. actors who venture over the the States to further their careers. Birmingham isn't going to have much, London is where it is centered. Also, you would need to have proper training as an actor, especially in the U.K. to be at all competitive in that market.
DW7J8huQaa	I'm no expert, but if you're talking about professional reviewers and not just your average reader, I could name a few things.    Reviewers look at the quality of writing (grammar, punctuation, sentence structure), the character development (does every character have a goal and conflict?), the plot line (does everything happen for a reason...coincidence is bad in stories, it makes them less believable), and the over all impression that the book gives.

d1ylRSSCaa	Try asking your teacher heaps of questions. Ask your teacher to go over any bits that your unsure of. Remember that your teacher wants you to dance well. They'll be happy to answer any possible questions that you might have.     If your too embarrassed to ask in front of the class you can ask during a break or after class. Ask about technique because that generally helps you improve your dancing overall.     Concentrate on looking at their stomachs, legs, and hips area as well.|`|VUxQRujkaa	One word = Practise|`|nXojcf2Caa	the best way to improve is to watch and learn, not just your teacher, but other dancers. with any choreography, whether you have to learn it or it's being taught to another dancer, pay attention to learning and try  picking up combinations and steps.     doing this, you'll find it a lot easier to pick up new choreography and combos and you'll be improving your technique. watching other dancers, you can pick up small things that you wouldn't otherwise. you learn different things from different people, so watching as many people as you can will also help you develop your own personal style, which will make you a better dancer and performer.    also, your teacher will see that you're taking initiative with learning new things and improving yourself, so that can also give you extra brownie points.

"what are the ups and downs to both sides???" errr i don't know about death but when you are alive you get a lot of experience and understand how to world moves. you need to take time out sometimes and think about what you have done. if you did something bad, took a wrong turn in life you would need to correct it.    Some ppl think that the correct way to do this is by taking your life and you will escape. However it's not the case. Ppl who think about themselves only commit suicide and stuff. They never take a moment to realize that if they didn't things could have changed for the better.    "what comes to your mind in general at all when you think of the two???"

If  you do not, and they don't like their photo taken you open up yourself to a heavy suit.  In my travels I have shot many native people without their knowledge and have captured some really great images as a result.  These candids are not easy to do especially when you don't want the subjects to notice they are being photographed.  I accomplished this with an attachment that goes on the front of the lens you are using.  It's very tricky to use and takes a lot of practice but works well.  It amounts to no more than a black tube with a front-surface mirror mounted at 90 degrees.  It has a fake glass in front to fool the subjects into thinking it's the front of the lens.  It also has a large hole in the "side" at which the mirror looks out from.  In other words, it's a periscope attachment and you line up with the subject at  the side of you, while the camera is pointed "away" from them.   One thing though; it "flips" the image.  So after you've downloaded it into the PC,  you must flip it back to bring it to the original state.   Hard to explain, but that's how it works.  It's a great tool.  I would never be without it shooting people and portraits like that.  I hope, for your sake, they still make them.

NYU37jfGaa	In the 1600s most people still lived in the country.  The commonest way for people to live was by running a small farm, growing enough food for themselves and selling the surplus, grazing animals on the common land.  The farmer's wife would generally be in charge of the poultry and the dairy, make her own butter and cheese, and sell her surplus eggs, fowls, and dairy produce at market.  Women would also spend some of their time spinning wool or flax into thread, either to make their own clothing or to sell to professional weavers.  Items like soap and candles might also be made at home.  Children would work on the farm as soon as they were old enough.  Country women were generally expected to take care of the family's health, since doctors and apothecaries were not readily available.  For instance, Gervase Markham's book 'The english Housewife' (1617) gives recipes for the treatment of over 200 different ailments that women were expected to be able to diagnose and treat.  A country village would consist mainly of small farmers, but would also have a few specialist craftsmen like the miller, the blacksmith, and the baker.    Towns were a lot smaller than they are now, but filled with tradesmen and craftsmen of every kind (contrary to what the comment above says, there were lots of shops in towns). There would be builders, carpenters, smiths, potters, weavers, tailors, buthcers, bakers, grocers, armourers, printers and bookbinders, chandlers, jewellers, etc. Businesses were often family affairs, with wives and children particitipating in the family business, whatever it might be.  A widow would often run a business after her husband died.  Children would be apprenticed to trades when they were old enough, or might work in domestic service (this was one of the commonest forms of employment for girls).    People generally had larger families then than they do now, and childbirth could be a hazardous experience, a lot of women died in childbirth, and the infant mortality rate was also quite high.  A woman normally gave birth with the aid of a midwife and her friends, men were usually excluded from the birth chamber.    Children were brought up quite strictly, expected to be polite and obedient to their parents, and to make themselves useful as soon as they were old enough.  However, that does not mean that parents did not love their children, when children are mentioned in letters and diaries from the period they are usually spoken of with great affection.  Children would have played with toys like balls, spinning tops, hobby horses, and girls would have dolls and boys toy weapons etc.  There were elementary schools which taught both boys and girls to read and write, but grammar schools, which gave older boys an intensive education mainly in the classics, were usually for boys only.  The majority of both boys and girls would leave school at an early age to go into domestic service or do some kind of apprenticeship.    People generally got up and went to bed earlier than they do now, because the lack of effective artificial lighting meant that people were more reliant on daylight.  Breakfast would be eatne early and would usually consist of bread, ale, and perhaps cold cold meat.  Dinner was eatned at about 12 o'clock, and was the main meal of the day.  In wealthy households, it might consist of several courses, each one offering a choice of different dishes.  People generally ate a lot more meat than they do nowadays, for instance the ration for sailors was two pounds of meat a day.  Most people drank ale rather than water, water was not considered healthy.      Music and dancing were popular with people of all classes, and most people learnt to play some kind of instrument.  Dances were popular with young people in particular because it allowed for contact with the opposite sex (generally young people socialised in groups rather than apiring off too early, since most people could not afford to marry until they were in their mid-twenties, early pairing off was discouraged).    Cards were popular as were board games like chess, draughts, and backgammon.  Billiards and bowling were popular games.  Games like hide-and-seek and blind-man's-buff were popular with children and adults.    In towns, theatres were popular (though in england they were closed down during the years of the Civil War and the Interregnum - the 1640s and 1650s).  People enjoyed sports like wrestling, football (football matches tended to be very large and rather violent), tennis, and archery.  Bloodthirsty sports like bull and bear baiting were very popular too.  And in the country, hunting and fishing were popular not just as sports but as sources of food.  Fairs were held in most towns at least once a year, and would be places not only to buy and sell but to see entertainments like jugglers, acrobats, fire-eaters etc.    There were many seasonal festivals that were celebrated, like Christmas, which used to last for 13 days, Easter, May Day, Mi|`|QEEweJUaaa	London was very different in 1600 than it is now...   london was very smelly place.There were different thigs that caused the smell for example the buchers would skin and gut animals and throw unwanted bits and bobs in the river [which was right by the houses] and people also put all there waste into the river. The smell in the street was very overpowering as you could imagine.     Above the smell some of the few things about cities, back then were that they were not safe places to live.so most people were in danger everyday.The danger came from crowded city conditions, rabid crime in the poorest areas, (not unlike today).     In then days you had pay for a doctor, so if you could afford a doctor he would probably 'bleed' you so that the evil spirits could escape from the system of your bady. most scholars believe that being doctored in those days often caused premature death.     Infant mortality was very high; more infants died than lived. women were always pregnant and large families were the norm. they kept having children because so many died in childhood because of all the dieses going round.     There was no such thing as a shopping mall or center, it was just the market. ships would sale in with lots of goods and london would starght away put the goods in the market.|`|oQTjeOekaa	life was pretty dull..boring and well not all that interesting... times were different so children got married early and therefore were uneducated in child bearing.

PtoieF7Caa	Why have you done this? (perhaps)    If he is cheating then there is a core problem that has caused him to cheat. Even if it's only that he is a womanizer. It's easy to jump to conclusions and lay blame, but before doing that you must find out what is the cause of this unfaithfulness.  If it is your fault then it is something you may consider changing, if it is his fault then he may consider changing.  If it is something that cannot be changed then you must simply accept that it will never work between you. You can't hold onto a person and if you only make each other miserable then it is best to simply let go.|`|yRZuoyPXaa	Out the door, out of my life.

The answer would be: (there's no words to ask mind you!) I heard the squish-squish you bastard!    I honestly don't know if I have enough faith(especially men-although women are starting to catch up if not surpass men in cheating) that human beings bereft of the social stigma can remain faithful for a lifetime.

What I think is that you suspect him of cheating but have no proof and he is denying it...and that isn't the same thing at all.    He may of course be right and you may be mistaken, the fact that you clearly don't understand exactly what it is you are saying tends to indicate that.|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	If you saw him actually cheating, what is the use of asking him? You already know the answer to the question you are asking him. But, if you just want to hear him tell you the truth, I would say " I saw you cheating on me. You can keep denying it because that is your choice and there is nothing I can do to change that. But, I can tell you, everything you do will come full circle. The pain you have put me through and continue to put me through will eventually find its way back to you. And when it does so, I hope a vision of me finds it's way into your mind."

It's slowly fading, but before you do anything, make sure you really want to do it.     Anyway, my backpack just has a bunch of writing on it. On the front, I wrote inside jokes, parts of lyrics, band names, friend's names, and I even have some spots where my friends signed when school ended.     On the arm thing, I drew little paw prints, stars and dots to make it a little more original. Also on the back, I wrote all the lyrics to my favorite song. Only thing is, it's on the back, so you don't see it.    So those are a few ideas.

XOnSRoR2aa	Insects undergo three stages of metamorphosis (egg, nymph, adult) and Gregor does as well.     The first stage is his metamorphosis into an insect. Initially his primary concerns are practical matters - missing the train to work and worrying about his office checking in on him. He's aware of the profound change his body has undergone, but not of all of its ramifications. His mindset is still that of being the primary breadwinner for the family.     Gregor's second stage is his physical adjustment to his new life as an insect, and his emotional adjustment to his family's attitude towards him.     The third stage is the complete reversal of family roles. His family no longer depends on him for financial support, and his survival is completely dependent on them. His health and morale begins to disintegrate, and he dies.     After his death the family comes through three stages of metamorphosis as well: there is a change in the family fortune; their sprits are renewed with the change of season into spring; and Grete becomes a young, beautiful bride.

You wouldn't look as foolish as you do saying they're your friend's.    All publishers are free. In fact, they pay you! That's how it works. You write the books, they sell them and you get paid based on sales.    You can pay thousands of dollars to a printing company, also known as a self-publisher, to print them for you and you get nothing. Or you can be published by a publisher and get paid.    The choice is obvious to me.|`|cEa8TTenaa	All good publishers are 'free' publishers. They get paid by selling your books. Poetry does not sell - nobody buys it. So nobody publishes it. Go and look at your own bookshelf... how much poetry do you actually buy? Not much, right?    There are very few poetry publishers - publishamerica is a scam. It takes money from people who know nothing about writing or publishing, like your friend.    It is very difficult to write dark poetry - it goes beyond 'ideas'. Your friend's poem does need work, like you suggest - the poem is not well punctuated, and some of her past participles are wrong. She needs to read a lot of poetry to see how it's done.    Money is never an issue with publishing. If the stuff is really really good, a publisher will take it on and take the financial risk. It's never the other way around. Of course, with poetry, this is almost impossible - but there is always lulu.com. It's actually free.    Good luck|`|mrmeCXQZaa	your work is very cool keep at it. answer? hell if i know!!!
cEa8TTenaa	Yes - find someone with a short life!    I think you mean a brief biography - or a mini bio.    To do this, you might like to take one aspect of that person's life, such as:    rather than the whole life of Charles Darwin, write how he liked to watch snails... and how they became the basis of his theory.    rather than write the whole of Virginia Woolf's life, deal with her relationship with her sister Vanessa Bell.    rather than write the whole of Jacques-Yves Cousteau's life, write about his Scuba invention.    rather than write the whole of Giacomo Leopardi's life, write how he spent his childhood reading in a dim library, and what he discovered there.    Take one aspect of someone's life, and make a mini-bio of it, but you must of course give the basic details, such as the years of birth and death, and the most salient relationships and locations.

However,this would not necessarily come automatically.Russia refused to back Serbia against Austria during the 1908 Bosnia-Herzgovinia crisis.They did back them after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in 1914,helping to precipitate WW1,

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you; the good and the bad, the ecstacy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was.

The clockwork universe, stated by the French physicist Laplace, was the idea that the universe operates by physical laws that would (in principle at least) allow us to predict perfectly cause and effect.  That would mean that things happen without the intervention of God.  If God exists, then he set the universe to playing like winding up a clock but now plays no part.    The uncertainty principle "allows" a place for unknown causes.  Every equation has to contain this provision for unknown cause that prevents us from perfectly predicting cause and effect thus destroying the notion of the clockwork universe.  This addition to the formulas is a random variable.|`|hpzfccwaaa	I would not have questioned my salvation on my own but the question came from another source most likely my conscious and in there i found my strength of faith to believe in the promise of my saviors words.

I've found a firm that's been in business since the 1879, they may have an archive that could help you (second link)    There's also a Shoe Museum in Northampton (third link)  Northampton Museum and Art Gallery,  Guildhall Road,  Northampton,  NN1 1D    Telephone: 01604 838 111  Fax: 01604 838 720    The fourth link is a bit more about shoe making history in Northampton|`|gb1BGP8xaa	Ten to one it should be boot closer, someone who sews the upper part of a shoe.

AA12343309	I think you are talking about a coat of arms which are mistakenly called "family crest."   A crest is part of a coat of arms.      Coats of arms do not belong to surnames.  Actually they don't belong to families.  They were granted or assumed by individual men and only the direct legitimate male line descendants can inherit one.  When a man was granted a coat of arms, all sons obtained one with some differences, but only the oldest son inherited his father's upon his father's death.      Poland and France are possibly the only two European countries that they belong to families but still they don't belong to surnames.    You can trace your family history back and if you find a direct male line ancestor that was granted or assumed a coat of arms, you can send your family tree to the heraldry authority of that country to get yours.   Another thing you can design and have your own made. If you are an American, I don't believe there is any way you can stop someone else from using your arms.    There are no laws regarding heraldry in the U.S.  If someone did they would be usurping your identity.  However, if you bought one of those little walnut plaques with a coat of arms on it and it is a valid coat of arms, you would be guilty of usurping another man's identity if you displayed it as yours.    In many cases more than one man with the same surname, not all necessarily related, were each granted or they assumed a coat of arms, all different.  No one peddler like House of Names, All Family Crest, etc will have all of them.  They don't need to in order to sell to the gullible.  The only time any one peddler will have more than one is if more than one man with the same surname from different national origins were granted one. Then they will have one of each and there might have been others.  Then most men with that surname were never granted or did they assume a coat of arms and their descendants are not entitled to one at all.    What is so bad about these peddlers selling such things as coats of arms is that usually a family history comes with them. That family history will not necessarily be the same family history of everyone with that particular surname. There have been people who have been t hrown off when starting their family history because they mistakenly believed the family history with a coat of arms they bought was theirs.
d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	The classic model is that of frightened people in a town being terrorized by a rich person who wanted to control all the land and people, and who could only be rescued by the heroic skills of a stranger who rides into town and single-handedly brings down the town bully.    Unless the lawman is the protagonist of the story (like "High Noon,") lawmen were mostly viewed as corrupt, cowards or buffoons.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Classic westerns reinforce law setting it in a black and white (no pun intended) form, there are no shades  the hero is typically a loner or outcast  always with a past that will be revealed, probably on meeting the romantic lead, or to the trusty sidekick, or on meeting the villain, his enemies (there are always more than one, although often with one irredeemable villain, the others are either shot in the lead up to the showdown or flee) are black-hearted through and through.    There are visual codes that an experienced film-goer would instantly recognise, the goody wears a white hat, the baddy wears a black hat; two men facing each other in a street means a gunfight will ensue; a crowded saloon (which always has bat-wing doors) will erupt into violence, chairs will be broken over heads, the piano-player will continue through the melee, bannisters will collapse at the least provocation, someone will go through a window; riding in a stagecoach is one of the most dangerous ways of travel; just as certainly if a wagon train forms a circle it is only a matter of time before the local Injuns* will attack; likewise saying that all is quiet is a sure way of attracting an arrow; faced with a choice between the local schoolteacher and the dancehall queen the hero will choose the schoolteacher; sidekicks will provide slight comic relief, dramatic tension or support for the hero to overcome his hidden past, unlikely to die the sidekick is liable to be wounded, while the heroine will be slighted/assaulted by the villain, giving the hero a chance to grit his teeth. Locations have visual codes, the lonely fort, ranch or homestead are likely to be attacked, small towns will contain a doctor (sympathetic character, occasionally drunk), a blacksmith (keeps his own counsel) with a livery stable containing a small boy (vulnerable possible victim) who looks up to the hero, a saloon (stage for various confrontations including the aforementioned big fight scene), a general store (storekeepers can be villainous exploiters or the smallholder's friend, occasionally supply love interest) and a sheriff's office/gaol, on the outskirts will be a school and or church and, of course a cemetery.    *I use Injuns because that is the term used to refer to any Native Americans in most classic westerns. Injuns are rarely noble savages, more often they are evil killers of homesteaders/soldiers/romantic interest's family.|`|QXQWDw1qaa	ANOTHE BUZZ WORD QUESTION asked by someone who doesn't have a CLUE about the subject they are asking about.

VMVW3E7Aaa	There are many different techniques involved in those examples, it would take a small book to cover them all.  Are you asking about the graphics/text/etc part of them, or the way the photos were planned and taken in the first place?    It might be better if you picked ONE of those photos at a time, and explain a bit more exactly what you're asking about.|`|C77c0OE2aa	Well... yeah, even rather mediocre photos can be made into a nice presentation with the right design work in Photoshop. However, that is something FAR beyond the scope of this little answer box. I, or no one else, can sit here and in a few words tell and teach you how to do intricate album graphic design work that many photographers take years to learn.     There are several wedding album creation software programs available, but they are usually costly, and would be of no use to you unless you were in the wedding photography business. Also, you need the album supplier contacts for album assembly.     There are also places that take wedding photos and do the entire album creation from start to finish, but again, you have to be "in the business" to even get a foot in the door with them, and cost is very high.    If you really want something nice, I would suggest you try contacting all the photographers in your area and asking if they would be willing to take your photos and create a nice album with them. Some will and some won't.    I have done albums for people even though i did not take the photos. In most all cases, they allowed some amateur to take the photos and dislike the results. I can at least create a nice album design with them, but it can become sort of a "show over substance" in a case like that.    If you want to email me, we could discuss doing this type of thing with your photos, and I could send you samples of past work.  steve@vettepics.com    steve
ABhmJepFaa	Locke is thought to have set three restrictions on the accumulation of property in the state of nature. The first one is that one may only appropriate as much as one can use before it spoils.    This spoilage restriction ceases to be a meaningful restriction with the invention of money because value can be stored in a medium that does not decay    One interpretation, advanced by C.B. Macpherson, sees Locke as a defender of unrestricted capitalist accumulation.
AA10725882	The Chinese would have printed many pieces of literature as stated above, but one most likely is the "Analects of Confucius" - a record of the words and acts of the Chinese philosopher Confucius - Kongfuzi (c. 500 CE) - and his disciples.   http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phals...    From Wiki (edited) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing  The printing press was invented in China by 593 A.D.  The first printed newspaper was available in Beijing in 700 A.D.   The Tianemmen scrolls was the earliest known complete woodblock printed book with illustrations - printed in China in 868 A.D.

Europeans were the first to really print books of a kind we would recognize, and as you note, the first was the Holy Bible.  The Chinese had a crude "printing press" before Europeans but there is no evidence that Europeans did not develop it independently of the Chinese.  Many inventions throughout history have sprung up in two or more areas that were not in communication.  Even in the late 19th century, the telephone was invented by two men on either side of the Atlantic who had no contact with each other (the one who got to the patent office first was named Bell).
U66CDN2Taa	This sounds like an essay question. This answer will not be an essay. But I can recall a couple of things from studying the play that are important.    Clearly there is some dysfunction in their relationship. It is unsurprising really given the circumstances, but Prospero is so protective of Miranda  he wants to shield her from Caliban and the magic on the island  that when the new arrivals get shipwrecked on the island you begin to see that she has been completely isolated by his actions. (He realizes this at the end of the play when he casts away his symbols of power and knowledge: staff and books)    The big theme here is about nature versus nurture. On the one hand you have Miranda falling in love, wanting to explore the island and meet new people. (She achieves this, see 'brave new world' speech  "Oh wonder, how many goodly creatures are there here, how beautious mankind is, oh Brave New World that has such people in it blah blah") On the other but Prospero is so wrapped up in the upbringing of his daughter that he fails to strike a balance between this and his nurturing her.    Ultimately, they both reach their epiphanies at the end of the play. You see their journey and in effect, they live happily ever after.    Hope that helps.|`|s5V02K8Saa	prospero is marandas dad|`|agiRRK4baa	are u trying to get someone else to answer a homework question?

Also, he was an expert in multiple forms of literature - he wrote three kinds of drama (comedies, tragedies, and histories) and different types of poetry - sonnets and much longer narrative poems, for example.    And we can guess that he had a sense of humor and fun - it's hard to detect in his plays because the vocabulary is so unfamiliar, but he was very dry and witty.

So you should probably start out thinking about the qualities YOU'D look for in a good lit prof. (You'll need to be able to back up this part of your answer with supporting ideas/facts. You could even check certain university's evaluation sheets to see what they ask students to look for in a good prof or which profs get teaching awards.)    Then examine Shakespeare's works AND life and see how well they fit your definition. That will force you to use specifics instead of vague generalities, thereby ensuring that you will learn more and think better. (As a result, you'll probably get a better grade, too.)|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Mainly diversity -    Plays (tragedies and comedies) and Sonnets (three different phases).

For some help, I have linked Shmoop below, which has great coverage of Shakespeare.|`|Gt3hRAA1aa	Well he certainly read a few books, one of which 'Roneo and Guillet' becoming 'Romeo and Juliet' one of his most famous plays.

Quite a few writers have been depressed and have committed suicide.    William Shakespeare wrote some great works, but maybe he wasn't a pleasant person. Maybe he hated people. Maybe he would never have taught if his life depended on it.

At least that's what I've heard, because I'm interested in becoming both. I think Shakespeare could do well because of his love for words and narrative, but of course it would depend on his personality as well. If he liked teaching, then fine. If he could not stand it, then obviously he'll do poorly. You must love what you do to do your best.|`|nBuUfUdkaa	Shakespeare wrote nothing, Frances Bacon wrote or supposedly wrote all the plays that Shakespeare was famous for.    check this out!!!    http://www.redicecreations.com/specialre...

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi Joey    To become a composer, search inside your soul. You have to have creativity, imagination, sense of improvisation and sensitivity to be able to communicate your mood effortlessly.    As for video game music or movies, you have to be able to sense what the movie is trying to convey and follow the mood. Same for games. To be an aranger, you need to understand theory, transposition etc...    Audio engineering is a different ball game. That is why many studio engineer can't read music but have heart and soul and don't need to understand as to why such and such a note is played. If it sounds on pitch, good timing, good grooving. End of story.    Experience outweighs lots of diplomas LOL.|`|LoKJBLF1aa	it is your work outside of school that will determine your success;learn all the theory you can at school, and put it into practise in your own time.If you are going to be serious about a career in music, then there is really little time for anything else. good luck.|`|XRX2sgniaa	As a former composition major, I have to tell you.... composition blows.

MCJAYZeZaa	I'm thinking Murtagh, Thorn, Galbatorix, and Shruikin will die. So will either Queen of the elves of Arya. Mostly because it would make for a good plot. Eragon is gonna have to go find the rock of Kuthian or however you spell it to open the vault of souls. Also I'm guessing that Glaedr's heart of hearts will be destroyed in the end. I'm also thinking Nasuada will possibly be killed, or at least the Varden disbanded so perhaps Orrin as well might die. Finally at the end Eragon will of course have to leave forever, whoop de do da. I think that it was guaranteed by the Menoa tree as the price for disturbing her. Or perhaps in a little twist it will just make Saphira leave and Eragon himself stay. That might satisfy the prophecy. These are just my ideas for what might happen.
