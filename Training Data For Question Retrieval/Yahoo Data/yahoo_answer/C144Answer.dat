rRceaE4Maa	Irma!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Fo sho (for sure)! :)|`|bIaywrBCaa	Halle Ester sounds better and not fond of Irma|`|dPULl5hjaa	Halle Ester|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Halle Ester|`|r5h7TmWJaa	I think both sound good, but Halle Ester sounds a bit better. The names fit very well together.|`|cErLq7f3aa	Halle Ester|`|qXq0nmBzaa	...sorry...I really don't care for either one.<br>  I'm not sure I'd want to name my child for a department store in Cleveland.<br>  HALLE (2) Gender: Feminine<br>  Usage: English (Modern) <br>  Pronounced: HAL-ee  <br>  In the case of American actress Halle Berry (1966-), it is from the name of a department store in Cleveland where she was born (the store was founded by brothers bearing the German surname Halle, a cognate of HALL).<br>  <br>  Why not consider Ester Halle? I like Esther Halle even better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I like Halle, but the middle names are a little aged. I don't think either name particularly flows (sorry!) but if they have sentimental meaning to you, like they're names of grandma's, than I think you could go with either. <br>  <br>  Besides, first and middle names are hardly said together. Go with the one that is more meaningful. <br>  <br>  Congrats to you both and good luck!|`|BRT2teSqaa	Both are for 77 year old women and they simply dont flow well.  Ester is also the name for a functional chemical group in Organic Chemistry.  <br>  <br>  Spell it Esther than Id pick that if I had to pick.|`|buzQSOM3aa	Halle Ester sounds a little too much like polyester to me so I say Halle Irma <br>  Good Luck Hope I helped|`|2An1XVQxaa	Halle Irma|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Ester.|`|AA10045887	Halle Ester sounds too much like polyester|`|vR6AwIppaa	what about halle jean?|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I like Halle. I do, but I don't think either middle name sounds right with it. I know they're family names so they're meaningful. It's just that Halle Ester reminds me of polyester and Halle Irma sounds like a medical condition. Sorry.|`|xsVu6lOEaa	personally I don't like either middle name but its your child and your choice...<br>  halle is beautiful and if I HAD to choose I would say Halle Irma... ester is off the adams family isn't it?|`|gC7OMToraa	Halle Ester sounds a little better, but I'm not crazy about the name Ester|`|zi8I4302aa	Halle Ester makes me think of Polyester...|`|w3ob12X6aa	def. Halle Ester|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Ester.  I don't like Irma at all.|`|Ehi3ifD5aa	Halle Ester is better.|`|MRtX1L2faa	halle is good <br>  irma and ester is eww<br>  no offense|`|7efc52fca43eedf86cf9eb0ca9e070a4aa	Halle is pretty!

02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	Media. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Liberal politicians, simple as that.<br>  <br>  The popular media - the radio stations that offer nothing else but pop music of its various ilks; the TV channels that promote dysfunctionality as a matter of course (see "Eastenders"), the magazines such as "Take a Bre*k" that focus upon worthless celebrities - singers who cannot pitch, guitarists who struggle to play more than three chords, the newspapers that present their articles in pictures and 'bite-sized chunks' of text, lacking punctuation, grammar and any sort of journalistic insight.<br>  <br>  Liberal politicians - that have removed the right of teachers to impose discipline in schools, that prosecute adults for intervening when they see children behaving in an anti-social manner.<br>  <br>  UK society is governed by political correctiveness and nobody seems to give a monkey's.|`|rbRQCTQfaa	I know, it's ridiculous. However, i don't think it's very surprising. What you did as a teen may not have been as bad, but there were certainly things changing that i'm sure shocked your parents. And even though you say it was "only 1980", that's just shy of 30 years ago, that's quite a lot of time for things to change.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	I do alot of underage stuff cos of peer pressure and influences mostly. I drink, but I am polite and I do appreciate my childhood. And the fact life will get much tougher when I go out into the big bad world. xxx|`|TXKKOa1Jaa	why don't we have crankable cars.  Times change, idk.|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	think you need to get with the times!|`|E6T9DPT9aa	The image of teens has changed. They are perceived as more aggressive and more harmful. The parental skills have loosened up a lot, so many teens now aren't as afraid to ask such things, and as they weren't as strict, teens do not know that it's such a bad thing anymore. Also, some parents let their kids do such things as they don't want to seem bad parents and they want to seem 'cool.'<br>  <br>  Basically it's  modernization.<br>  <br>  But there's no-one in particular to blame.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|qv493CGiaa	I know kids nowadays want more freedom. <br>  I dunno its weird. <br>  I'm 15 and its as though i can't win with my dad, he moans when i do go out and moans when i don't go out. <br>  And from when my step-dad talks to me about when he was younger (which is quite often) parents and teachers were alot stricter back then. <br>  But i dunno. Try talking to your son and doing more things with him so then you may trust him to stay over his gf's. All he wants is a bit of freedom :)|`|tw1uePBbaa	parents are way too lax these days.  i am only 26 and feel the same way you do!  there is no way i would ever let a 17 year old spend the night with his girlfriend!  my aunt did that with her 16 year old daughter and wound up with her first grandchild.  my in-laws allowed their 16 year old son to travel over 700 miles by himself to meet his internet girlfriend (who was also 16!)  and they spend a whole week sharing a room together and it was the first time they had ever met!!!  tell me thats not crazy?|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	Kids ain't allowed to Enjoy their childhood. (I'm 15). We have tests to worry about. Peer pressure. hormones and a bad reputation. Such as adults are moaning about teen behaving irresponsibly and having sex and taking drugs, they tell us top grown up. Then when we are grown up they want us to be a kid again. Being a teenage in this decade is hard|`|e2fcf80b23bc0e813b66134b3445bf5daa	I feel your pain! I have a teenage son too.!|`|1db6eeb8c0bf1ee2c57e7f3f62c494cdaa	I don't know but its really sad =0( I'm the same way...I can't imagine ever asking my parents to do the things that these kids want to do.  I'm only 27!  I'm barely 10 years out of high school.  I think so many parents have dropped the ball morally and let their kids do whatever they want that its twice as hard for other parents b/c their kids want the same rights and liberties as their friends.  My parents used to tell me I know you want to stay out until midnight (for example) and its not that we don't trust you but we care about you and your safety and that is why we don't want you out that late.  Knowing that it wasn't that they were trying to ruin my life helped smooth things over somewhat haha!|`|N1Wc8JPTaa	Get a grip. Teens are having sex at about 14, sometimes younger now. They drink, smoke and do everything younger (actually not smoking because i think everybody smoked at like 12ish). It's not going to stop and when you are 17 you can do what you want. Teens aren't bad for having underage sex, they do it usually because they love each other and the people who just randomly shag guys arent bad either. You do it when your 18 onwards and its considered fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  I live in the UK, and yes actually they can. You can move out when you are 16 so you have no control over him. Fair enough he lives in your house and should go by your rules but if he decides to go live with his girlfriend you couldn't stop him.|`|zaogXoHjaa	I'm nearly 15 and I agree with you 100%.<br>  A lot of teenagers round my area are out of control and have no discipline and therefore do what they want, when they want. They watch things in films or on TV and want to be just like the people in the shows - easy influenced. Somehow they think its accepted and that they can act 21 when in fact they have a mental age of 10. Its like all the teens that post pictures of themselves drinking on Facebook or them at nightclubs and all that. What's the rush to be an adult? You're an adult for a very long time and you have a lot of responsibilites. Its really sad to think its come to this.|`|YG7Prmoyaa	I totally agree with you.<br>  The funny thing is im still a kid myself<br>  14 years old(:<br>  and I feel the same way!<br>  I like enjoying my childhood while I feel others want to grow up so fast!<br>  I guess its just the generation and what were being influenced with these days.<br>  Everything changes so fast, and whether its good or bad<br>  everyones accepting it!|`|16641bd7e1d219d87426f344e7659b26aa	I have a teenager and I get really annoyed when people demonise young people. This generaion are no different to those that went before them. <br>  <br>  My guess is that you just can't remember!! I'm not saying it's OK to stay with the girlfriend but I think it's normal/healthy to want to. Actually it's great he asks you. Well done you. It sound like you have done a good job...|`|qOLB6zYIaa	you need move with the times. theres alot worst things going on with teens than girlfriend , booze and 18 rated films, a girlfriend is a contructive thing to have in your sons life better than being in a gang isnt it. plus if hes 17 hes legally aloud to have sex.|`|Om1yADWRaa	Media!! <br>  <br>  saying that i'm 17 never wanted to do any of that but I'm now a mum to a 1 year old and am starting the family life now.|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	Here's the question. Would you rather not know about what your son is doing?|`|3LhwoBPDaa	Because as humans, we get bored easily. We always want the "next big thing" or newest edition. Getting instant gratification: sex, drugs, is so 2000 and everyone wants to feel good and not give a darn about the consequences.<br>  <br>  By the time I have kids, I think marriage will be as obsolete as dial-up.<br>  <br>  Anyway, kids want to try everything and look cool in front of everyone else. It'd be nice if someone spoke up and said, "Uh guys, Am I the only one doing this to impress you?"<br>  <br>  I know that was a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but each generation gets bored easily and wants to have fun no matter the cost.<br>  <br>  I know I sound old, but I just turned 20. I'm one of those does his work, goes home, wouldn't ask to stay out at prom types, but only because I was raised so strictly, I think you're being fair with your son and just have to understand that he wants to be a man(go to his girlfriend's house) but live as a boy:come back to you when he's bored...(it's how I was raised though and if I rebel against it, I'll be homeless, so this kidn of is pointless and doesn't help...don't know how I'll raise my kids though..)|`|KHI7MB4iaa	That's because things happen and times change<br>  If nothing changed where would we all be?<br>  <br>  Cavemen.<br>  <br>  And if he's 17 then I don't understand why don't you want him to stay at his girlfriend's house?<br>  <br>  It's legal for him to have sex with her and he is almost an adult.<br>  <br>  I don't see what the problem is.<br>  <br>  I'm sure he's mature enough to deal with things by himself by the age of 17.<br>  <br>  And btw the majority of kids are not rude.<br>  I say "Hello" and "Good morning" to people as I pass, and most of the time get awful look off adults or pensioners.<br>  <br>  Who's been rude there?|`|aOCfLAJJaa	It's called "Peer pressure and media".
QLopvWKDaa	With my first baby my early labour was very much what you describe!  Call the doctor and let them know, they might want to check you or they will tell you when to know "it's time".<br>  <br>  I think that you just may have this baby before the weekend is over- YEA! Good Luck!|`|zwctZ812aa	I had that type of pain the last week in my pregnancy.  It felt a little like a real contraction but not as strong, and constant.  It really never went away, not to discourage you or anything, until labor started, and then it was replaced with contractions.  When you feel the real labor contractions, you will know.  They are pretty easy to recognize.  The good news is labor can come on suddenly all at once even if you havn't been dilated up to that point.  I hope you go into labor naturally soon!!|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Is this your 1st? I think if you are feeling pressure lower down then baby is on its way - not immediately tho!!<br>  Baby has probably moved right down, so watch out for contractions starting over next few days - you will know a contraction when you have one, belly tightens for several seconds then releases. <br>  Whatever you do, don't sit on the toilet if you feel the need to push! Get onto the floor instead. I won't scare you with details why, except to say when my friend gave birth on her bathroom floor last November she was ordered by the paramedics to get off the toilet as it was dangerous for baby.<br>  Just watch out for the tightening sensations, but if you're worried or concerned you're labouring already, go up to the hospital and ask then to check you out. That friend I mentioned didn't realise she was in labour (she had a c-section with her 1st) and has a high pain threshold, which is why she ended up birthing in the bathroom!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	It could be a sign of labor. At this point in pregnancy, anytime you notice something different happening with your body, like this, you should be calling your Dr.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	pressure and back pain are signs of labor i would wait for a bloody show or some contractions you will know what they are lol but some women just think that they have to poop i would ask your doctor rather be safe than sorry|`|UxhzluZnaa	it could very well be back labor i had it with my son bad and didnt even know i was in labor till i got to the hospital, try resting or taking a warm bath if nothing helps chances are it labor. if your groin feels like you need to push like pressure the baby is sitting right on it and that wil help you to dialate.  if you think they could be contractions and want it to happen walk, if walking makes it worse then chances are you are in labor|`|4aguqVyIaa	Could have been a contraction, but seeing that its not happening in a consistent pattern it is most likely not labor quite yet.  Sorry :(  Even if you don't catch the first ones or dismiss them, you'll definately feel later ones and know for sure that its not just gas pains.  You don't have to notice at the very beginning anyways.  Good luck.  I hope they start up strong and consistent for you soon!
64OsCr8laa	because thats the attitude that smart elic teens fear! if everyone was the students friend then there would be not rule system. someone has to crack day on the trouble makers and its her!! you should jusr respect her and do nothing wrong then you will not cross her path|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Maybe because if she wasnt like that kids would think they could be rude to their teacher for no reason at all, an no one what so ever would do a damn thing about it. not trying to be funny but they need more people working like her in schools.|`|zaogXoHjaa	Its probably the way she is. Its like having some teachers that are too soft and then some that are very strict. People have respect for this woman and obviously know not to mess with her.|`|tw1uePBbaa	its called respect-it should be worse if she argues.  rules are there for a reason.  im guessing that by her being harsh she also has to deal out a lot less punishment, becuase more people are afraid of facing the punishment|`|3LhwoBPDaa	She thinks fear is the same thing as respect. She needs to take sensitivity classes.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	You better hope she doesn't punish you for raping the english language.You'd better off if you learned how to write a frickin sentence.|`|ggBxkukFaa	It's really not anything with her wanting or having a reputation..you will find..when you grow up..that even you will command respect from certain individuals! We all do!!|`|657kKxnYaa	I think she just wants respect.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	so the students will respect her, listen to her and know that she means business. she's not there to be a friend, she is there to do her job, which is to run the school.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Same with my school.<br>  <br>  <br>  They are just trying to lay down the law. He's actually really nice if you're nice to him.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Because that's the way you get people to do stuff. If they're scared, they won't argue. For instance, there's a new dance teacher at my studio, and he's sweet and never yells so most people never listen (I do.) The head director yells, and everyone listens to her and never talk. See the difference?|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Maybe the admin. thinks that is the only way she can get respect. It might be true. Who knows? Maybe she doesn't care if the students like her. There are thousands of different reasons why.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	It's called respect.<br>  <br>  And not butchering the written English language. For the love of all that is holy, would it kill you to punctuate your questions?|`|aiDV9FgGaa	It is called respect.
E6T9DPT9aa	Person A: "*i pull you onto the bed*"<br>  Person B: "* i remove your top*"<br>  <br>  etc<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|wnkoTEqVaa	i dont think you can be raped online.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	That isn't possible.<br>  <br>  I don't mean, whether or not, you saw that.  I mean to be raped online.|`|NaYTDqmnaa	there is realy no such thing as online sex thats called virtual sex its kinda of like talking on the phone but through a computer its only online sex if u guys r talking about doing stuff to each other. rape is when someone makes u have sex with them ny throwing you on the bed and all that stuff
75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	I haven't heard of this. Honestly, I think craving sweets is just a part of being pregnant :)<br>  Everyone craves different things. I have been cravings sweets lately too and I am also 26 weeks. So far all of my appointments have been fine. I have to pee in a cup every time and they check it for sugar and protein. Every time it's normal. The glucose test will tell you for sure, but I wouldn't worry too much.|`|lSCPvOwtaa	You dont nessesaraly have GD just becuase you crave sweets, but it is possible.<br>  <br>  Someone who has diabetes craves sweets when the sugar content in thier blood is low.<br>  <br>  Dont worry though.  GD is easily controlled with a little extra effort.|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	No...it could be the sweets these women are eating is what is causing the GB. I had it with my 3rd and I knew b/c I would feel really weak, sick, sweaty, shakey and as soon as I drank some juice or ate something I felt fine..|`|LKIsoYdgaa	I had GD with my first pregnancy and I craved Bar-B-Que sauce on everything.  It does have alot of sugar in it, but I wasn't really craving traditional sweets like cake, candy etc...<br>  Good luck|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I am 32 weeks now and I always craved sugar!still do. I didn't pass my 1 hr glucose test.My sugar level was high. Now I have to fast for 12 hrs and do 4 hr test...I am really worried. But I feel and I know that I think I have GD coz I crave sweets all the time...And after my 1st test I got in cold swet and my hands were shaking after 3 hr after I drank glucose.This is mean my sugar droped very low from high.I think I am GD|`|G3aqrP94aa	I had GD and I was testing 4 times a day and injecting. Its not fun let me tell ya! trust me tho it doesn'tt hurt.... I never craved any sweets really. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks before my daughter was born a month ago today =] my blood sugar was crazy out of control even the hospitalcouldn'tt get it normal. too high too low... they controlled my diet even. Don't worry too much sweetheart... =] I didn't crave sweets and I still got GD|`|qitXGd0qaa	My GTT was borderline for GD. I tested my blood sugar at home 4 times daily to keep an eye on things and my doctor monitored me a little closer just in case.<br>  <br>  I craved carrotts and apples, no chocolate, cakes or candies. However I was told by a nutritionist that while fruits contain "good" sugars, its hard for your body to process them if you over consume them.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	Cravings during pregnancy are normal and what you crave can be anything.

ebQJsYTxaa	My kids, ages 5 years and 20 months, have never gotten any vaccines. They are both very healthy.<br>  <br>  It's never too late to stop vaccines.  It's very simple--you just stop.  Your doctor many not be happy about that, so to find a doctor who will respect your right to make vaccine decisions for your child, here are some links:<br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/Vaccine_Friendly_Doctors.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/Vac...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mothering.com/discussions/forumdisplay.php?f=76" rel="nofollow">http://mothering.com/discussions/forumdi...</a> (click on the area in which you live, and ask for a doctor referral in that forum)<br>  <br>  To find out how to get a vaccine exemption for school in the United States: <a href="http://mothering.com/discussions/showthread.php?t=953402" rel="nofollow">http://mothering.com/discussions/showthr...</a><br>  <br>  For Canada: <a href="http://vran.org/legal/forms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vran.org/legal/forms.htm</a><br>  <br>  To "emucompboy": Give me a break--you obviously know nothing about whooping cough (pertussis).  My daughter and I both had it when she was 2 1/2 years, and although it was an annoying cough that lasted a few months, we were nowhere near death, lol.  And we required no medical treatment.  I'd easily choose that experience over the chance of a lifelong vaccine injury from the DTaP vaccine.<br>  <br>  To "walterskinner8": It is no longer possible to get the MMR separated into 3 separate shots.  Merck has discontinued production of the separate measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, and they have no plans to start again. <a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/clinical-care-research/20081224merckcombo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publi...</a>|`|SK7MxFTnaa	The hardest time for vaccinations is usually around the 2 yr mark.  They normally get 4 or 5.  The one big one being the MMR 3 in one shot.<br>  <br>  It's a lot for such a small and undeveloped immune system to handle, most kids do alright but when my son was diagnosed with autism thats when I decided that my daughters would get them ( the MMR ) spaced   out into3 separate shots.  DON'T let your doctor tell you you cant get them that way because you can.  HOWEVER your insurance may make you eat the extra cost which is what I did.<br>  <br>  It's not to late to stop them, no.<br>  <br>  Ever wonder why the Government pushes the flu shots so hard in the fall?  They're all most always free but for a type of flu that is NOT occurring that year.<br>  <br>  It's a great way to get all sorts of information on you and inoculate you against something you shouldn't get in the first place.   More people I know that get the shot get sick than the other way around.<br>  <br>  I haven't had a flu shot like that in over 20 years...and guess what?<br>  <br>  I've never gotten the flu.  I also don't believe in coincidence.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well fist of all the first person who answered you can't be 100% positive on the school thing because a friend of mine didn't get her kids vaccinated and had A LOT of trouble trying to get them into the school system without their vaccinations. maybe it depends on each state or school district but i know the school where i live refuses to take children who are not properly vaccinated.<br>  however she is right... it's a choice that each parent has to make based on what they feel is right for their kids. i vaccinate my children. i think it's safer to vaccinate then to not.|`|qayCggxMaa	My kids have had all of the vaccinations they are supposed to (well, ok, my daughter missed her flu shot this year, but I meant to get it) and they will continue to get them.|`|MUbbzN17aa	vaccines that have been on the market more than 5 years, yes.<br>  vaccines that have been on the market less than 5 years, no.  wait for the real world reports to come back to the fda.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	My children are 7 and 9 and have both been vaccinated.

And even from medical professionals! The nurse married to a nurse who is an antivaccinator?  I think someone's in need of some CEUs.<br>  Let me just suggest, that before you get sucked into doing "research" (and by research I mean googling) on the woes of vaccination, why not research the ills cause by the diseases you're vaccinating against? These are far more dangerous and while they may not kill as many people today as they would have back in the 50's when the diseases were more prevalent (better medicine now) they can cause just as much morbidity if not the mortality. Also do not mistake, these diseases are far from gone. The UK has been seeing a lot of measles and mumps outbreaks recently (this is the latest <a href="http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/newshome/Dozens-of-students-fall-ill.4999512.jp)." rel="nofollow">http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/newshome/Doz...</a> And there have been outbreaks in the US as well.<br>  Finally, the biggest misconception about vaccines is that not getting them means you're only putting your own child at risk. You put everyone's child at risk when you don't vaccinate. If you're going to google anything, understand the concept of "herd immunity."<br>  Please, don't be roped in by conspiracy theorists who believe the govenment forces vaccines of people...why?...to cause autism? Doctors want to subject your child to needles? Don't be silly. They're recommended because they are safe and because they keep ALL our children from debilitating diseases.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	I had  both my boys vaccinated and they seem fine so far.  I will continue to do so with any follow-ups or boosters that are required.  It can be hard sometimes getting your children into school without these vaccines without jumping through a lot of hoops, but it really comes down to what the parents choose.  I have heard of parents that have chosen to home school their children just to save themselves the hassle and I say more power to them. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Immunization and Vaccination Laws in the US<br>  Lawyers.comsm<br>  <br>  In 1809, Massachusetts became the first state to pass a law requiring immunization against smallpox. Since then, immunization laws have been a controversial topic that, to this day, continues to be fought over in state legislatures and the courts.<br>  <br>  On one side of the argument are advocates of immunization, who argue that vaccines are a safe, necessary way to protect the public health. On the other side of the argument are people who object on religious grounds or who question the safety and effectiveness of immunizations.<br>  <br>  Immunization Laws Effecting Adults<br>  <br>  The federal and state governments do not require adult citizens to be vaccinated, although the National Immunization Program recommends certain vaccinations for adults. However, many adults are required to be vaccinated as a condition of employment in the public and private sector. For example, the US military requires that everyone entering military service be vaccinated against certain diseases. In addition, the government imposes vaccination requirements on non-US citizens who want to reside in this country. Foreign citizens who are seeking permanent residency in the United States, as well as foreign-born children who are entering the country to be adopted, must be vaccinated against all vaccine-preventable diseases before being allowed to enter the country.<br>  <br>  Immunization Laws for Children<br>  <br>  The government does require children to be vaccinated. For example, every state has immunization requirements that must be fulfilled before a child may enter school. These school immunization laws are often based on the recommendations of the infectious disease committees of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.<br>  <br>  Most states require that children entering school be vaccinated against:<br>  <br>      * Diphtheria<br>      * Haemophilus influenza type b<br>      * Hepatitis B<br>      * Pertussis (whooping cough)<br>      * Polio<br>      * Measles<br>      * Mumps<br>      * Rubella<br>      * Tetanus (lockjaw) <br>  <br>  Some states also require the varicella (chicken pox) vaccine.<br>  <br>  Although many adults may have received the smallpox vaccine when they were young, this vaccine is not required nowadays because the disease is no longer a threat.<br>  <br>  Most states require the parents or guardian of a child entering school to provide written proof signed by a healthcare provider of each child's compliance with the vaccine requirements. Unless there is a religious objection to vaccination or a health condition that precludes vaccination, children who have not met the state requirements will not be permitted to attend school.<br>  <br>  Religious, Philosophical and Medical Objections to Immunizations<br>  <br>  Every state except West Virginia and Mississippi allow parents with religious objections to immunization to apply for an exemption for their child from the state's immunization requirements.<br>  <br>  Twenty states allow parents who have a philosophical objection to immunization to apply for an exemption. These states are:<br>  <br>      * Arizona<br>      * Arkansas<br>      * California<br>      * Colorado<br>      * Idaho<br>      * Louisiana<br>      * Maine<br>      * Michigan<br>      * Minnesota<br>      * Missouri (applies only to daycare, preschool and nursery school)<br>      * New Mexico<br>      * North Dakota<br>      * Ohio<br>      * Oklahoma<br>      * Pennsylvania<br>      * Texas<br>      * Utah<br>      * Vermont<br>      * Washington<br>      * Wisconsin <br>  <br>  All states allow for medical exemptions to immunization. Medical exemptions are usually granted to children with compromised immune systems, allergies to vaccine ingredients, and other chronic or severe illnesses.<br>  <br>  If you have a religious or philosophical objection to immunizing your child, you'll need to supply an affidavit to the school testifying to that fact. If the school refuses to honor your objection, in most cases a letter from your lawyer that explains your legal right to object should solve the problem. In extreme situations, parents have fought their local school districts in court to gain or uphold their right to keep their child from being vaccinated.<br>  <br>  Information About Risks and Benefits of Vaccines<br>  <br>  Federal law requires that parents, guardians or patients be given written information about the risks and benefits of vaccination before administering the vaccine. In addition, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires all healthcare providers in the United States to provide copies of a Vaccine Information|`|Mh8pATk8aa	i will vaccinate my kids. it seems the vaccine scare was typical fear mongering brought to you by the media, and it's not based on science.  unfortunately, it's easier to scare people than to unscare them.<br>  <br>  here are some more references for your collection:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/112/6/1394" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cg...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimeros...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/123/1/e164" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cg...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17688775" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a>|`|mx3gFmIKaa	You can stop at any point.  97-98 percent of parents comply with childhood vaccines.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.909shot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.909shot.com</a><br>  <br>  go under state laws and exemptions.

TJ4q7X8Vaa	We are just getting through this problem. Sometimes you just have to let her cry and go cry yourself. My daughter all of the sudden started waking in the middle of the night several times and would cry endlessly unless she was sleeping next to or on me. She would always want to be with me during the day. Finally we just started closing her bedroom door and letting her cry. Within minutes she would soothe herself to sleep. Now she is back to sleeping through the night and enjoying time with other people like Daddy. I guess she just needed to realize that I can't always be her sandman or personal entertainer.
vygYFdsSaa	Awww, hang in there. I've heard spicy food can help??|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Hello there, I know exactly what you are going through, 14 days over and had to be induced with my first and my second came 13 days over.  <br>  Every day seems like a year doesn't it?<br>  <br>  I'm afraid sperm is full of protoglastins (I think that's what they're called) and if rubbed on the cervix opening, can cause the "plug" to move and trigger labour.<br>  <br>  You can try stimulating your nipples - it's been said that this releases a hormone to "fool" the body into thinking you are breastfeeding, so can cause contractions.<br>  <br>  Raspberry leaf tea "tones" the cervix, but despite warnings on the box, I have never had any luck with it.  It says you should start taking it from 30 odd weeks, but I also did this, and it didn't do anything.<br>  <br>  Lots of walking of course, particularly (though I'm not too sure this doesn't just smack of the desperation of us overdue ladies, not that I am now) over uneven surfaces.<br>  <br>  Eggplant/Aubergine is said to have properties to start contractions as is pineapple, though my midwife said that in both cases, you would have to eat so much that it was probably sickness that made you go.<br>  <br>  Not many people advise castor oil nowadays, as in reality, it triggers diarrhoea rather than labour, which can in turn trigger labour, but many women for whom this worked have ended up so exhausted and ill they did not fully enjoy the experience of holding their first born.<br>  <br>  If you are the sort of woman who can give yourself an orgasm, then that too can release hormones.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly, and I hate to sound so pessimistic, if you are not ready to go, you just wont.  I think what saved me from having to be induced for the 2nd time was 3 membrane sweeps, much as I didn't appreciate them at the time.  However, in praise of them, no matter how uncomfortable they are, I started labour at 5.30am and my son was born at 7.01am - he just shot out.<br>  <br>  I can guarantee you that when you hold your baby, you will just forget all of this anxiousness and frustration, it is the greatest feeling on earth.<br>  Good luck. xxx|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Castor oil just makes you poop...so stop using it!<br>  <br>  Nipple stimulation can help...if you don't have a breast pump...you can stimulate on your own.|`|aWL7mkbMaa	Walk and squads...

SRsFkNBBaa	im sorry, but i guess im old school. i don't see anything wrong, with your older one giving your younger one , back what he dishes out. my kids did the same thing, and they loved thier siblings, so it wasn't like they would "hurt" them. they would just let them know, if you hit me your gonna get it back. it worked out well.<br>  i would still punish him for his fits & destructive behavoir. i think all kids do this, try to push buttons and limits persay. my kids went through it for a couple of weeks, both of them. im expecting my 3rd one to also. keep consistant. remameber that this age isn't very good with a long line of requests. anotherwards, punishment and what he should be doing should be given seperately, not together. don't put him in time out and tell him at the same time, what he should be doing. he won't remember both. put him in time out, and when its time to get out, ask him why he was put there. when he answers you, tell him if hes right, and give the right behavoir. this worked well for me. it stopped the behavoir in about 2 weeks. they have such a shor attention span, we sometimes forget that they probably only heard 3 out of the 10 words we just told them, so break it up. <br>  as much as you don't want your oldest disiplining, its probably good for them to figure it out. i never get involved, unless someones bleeding. and my kids know it. you know what?? none of my kids are tattletales either. peace reigns in our house, becuase they know if one hits the other, youll get it back. so you might as well save yourself the trouble and not do it in the first place.|`|0PVmzXc0aa	punish him.<br>  I know he is very young but take away something he really loves when he does this.<br>  and maybe give him a prize at the end of the day if he has behaved well give him a treat if he hasnt then dont.|`|f3xNSnGkaa	well if he is 1 1/2 and is throwing theese kinds of fits then it is mosstlikely cause he doesnt feel heard or is having a hard time communitcating. he could want attnetion. well idk i am oonly 14|`|tBtOTiQDaa	i teach my kids that if someone hits them its okay to defend themselves, reasonably<br>  i would let them sort it out, unless it gets too violent|`|9AnNb7Tbaa	Spank the younger one dont let the younger one play with his friends until he can be trusted around other people.|`|uKJUKs8Naa	seperate them.|`|X1y5fbohaa	just let the kids play|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	time to start spanking|`|AA12080472	u tell the younger one not to hit his brother.  u intervene because he is still a baby and doesn't know how to work things out.|`|yacLHWqEaa	seperate them!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Any time that you see them hit each other, put them both in time out and then when they are done make them give each other a hug and tell each other that they are sorry. Even though the little one started it. I've heard of the terribel two's. If you continue to have that way of thinking and that he's just going through a phase then he won't get better. You need to step up and be his mother and quit being so soft. I am going through the terrible two's right now myself but this is much more than just the terrible two's. My son has never resorted to physical violence and throwing huge temper tantrums. All the other two year olds that I know are much milder and not so VIOLENT. You asked for the help we are just trying to get you to open your eyes and realize this is much more than the terrible two's. Help him now or lose him forever. Which one do you want??|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You could let your older child deal with his sibling, when the younger one has been dealt with by his brother a couple of times, that may cure the hitting.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't fix it, remove the younger one and put him in his crib or a play-pen for a few minutes until he calms down.<br>  <br>  I would suggest talking to him and dealing with his tantrums, BEFORE they happen, when he is calm.  Talk to him about playing nice, being kind, sharing toys etc, when he is calm.<br>  <br>  When a child is "losing it" is not the right time to try to get your point across.|`|el8yX5q3aa	It is time to put that child in a time out and /or swat his butt and teach him right from wrong.  <br>  <br>  WHY do your children have temper problems.?????  I would certainly look at my own boundaries and what I  might be doing wrong becuase one child...ok...but two with temper problems?  <br>  <br>  Are you sure the older one isn't instigating it?<br>  <br>  I never allowed that.  They KNEW they better not pull that crap.<br>  <br>  This is physical violence he is learning...this is an absolute NO NO!  If he was pitching a fit for a cookie or something then maybe a time out would be appropriate...but not physical violence.  YES this is VIOLENCE on a small scale..and it leads to bigger things.<br>  <br>  I personally would let the bigger child just let him push and hit him once.........when you interferer it sends messages to the younger one that mommy will save him and it is ok to do that.  Nothing says NO like having it given back to YOU!    <br>  <br>  When it does happen...tell him...well see what happens when you hit someone?  Mommy can't always be there when you hurt someone.

VKQzj4Pmaa	Home Remedies for Stomach Ache<br>  <br>  "Eat an herb which aids digestion, such as ginger (ginger-ale, or ginger snaps), peppermint (gum and candy cane as long as it is real peppermint) or Aloe Vera Juice (an anti-parasitic that tastes terrible but aids digestion). Similar herb teas that help digestion include mint, ginger or chamomile tea.<br>  <br>  Take a small piece of ginger and grate it. Thereafter, squeeze out its juice. Apply the juice on the bottom of your belly and massage gently. It is an effective home remedy for stomach ache.<br>  <br>  Drink regular tea with freshly squeezed lemon or honey. This will definately help in the relaxation of the stomach. Do not put sugar in the tea if you are drinking it with lemon or honey. This will make the tea useless.<br>  <br>  Eat yogurt. It contains bacteria your stomach is lacking during an upset stomach. My microbiology professor and others have said this and I personally tried it and it works.<br>  <br>  Loosen your belt. If your stomach is distended from IBS, you can loosen your belt. If you're tightly buttoned and belted up, try switching to comfortable, loose clothing, which can ease the pressure on your aching stomach, says Dr. Borum. (It's obvious only after you think of it.)<br>  <br>  Take the charcoal from the fire and mash it up in a small cup(preferably plastic so it don't shatter when mashing up the charcoal)add just enough water to cover the smashed charcoal and drink it. I have seen the military do this before so i know that it will work. It will be pretty hard to get it down because it tastes really bad but you will feel alot better if you get it down guaranteed. Or if you have charcoal tablets, just take however many the package says. I promise this will work."<br>  <br>  Cola syrup works. If you do not have that, drink flat Coca-Cola. If you have gripe water, that is also good for adults, and you can try that as well.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	flat coke?<br>  try some veggies.  when i've had sugar overload - i go the opposite and sometimes that helps|`|YAwvszITaa	self induced how?

fWAzJIEkaa	If u get positive a few time then ur definitely pregnant! <br>  Bleeding in early pregnancy is very common and is generally no cause for concern. Around half of all pregnant women have a little bleeding in the early months of pregnancy. Although some of these women may later suffer a miscarriage, the majority carry on to have normal and straightforward pregnancies. Some women bleed for a few days around the time of their expected periods, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. This bleeding is usually much lighter than a normal period, but may be accompanied by discomfort - sometimes even pain - and a heavy, dragging feeling. The medical term for this sort of bleeding is 'decidual' bleeding. The 'decidua' is the innermost lining of the uterus, the part lost during each menstrual period. Experts think that this bleeding is from that part of the decidua that is not yet covered by the developing embryo and placenta. Very early bleeding may be 'implantation' bleeding rather than decidual bleeding. Implantation bleeding happens about two weeks after conception, when the fertilised egg reaches the uterus and embeds in the soft lining. Special cells surrounding the egg burrow deep into the lining, almost like a seed putting out tiny roots. This is the start of the placenta. Some women loose a little blood when this takes place. Implantation bleeding rarely lasts for more than a day.<br>  You cannot have a period while you are pregnant because both of these functions cannot happen at the same time. If you were pregnant and began menstruating, inevitably you would lose the pregnancy or have a miscarriage. Although you can't be pregnant and have a period at the same time, you can, in fact, experience vaginal bleeding and continue to be pregnant. These are two very different terms: vaginal bleeding and menstruation (period), but it is usually vaginal bleeding that women confuse as their periods.<br>  Bleeding early in pregnancy, as in the first trimester, is scary, but luckily it usually doesn't signal a problem. It is also rather common among women. There are a few common causes of first-trimester bleeding, none of which is an indication of trouble.<br>  <br>  Hope it heps..and if ur still worried go and speak to your doctor, who will test you and explain these bleedings for you!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!xx|`|6DnvfpZTaa	I had my periods all the way through my pregnancy, regularly and on time every month. i would go to your doctor for a check up to confirm your pregnancy and if you are tell him straight away about your bleeding so you can have an early scan and check everythings ok.<br>  continuing to have your periods during pregnancy is very rare and there may be another reasons why your bleeding so get yourself checked as soon as possible to be safe x|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Have you gone to your dr?

Don't be afraid to ask your midwife-if they've heard it hundreds of times before it's because other women are having the same worry.  <br>  <br>  Take time to rest, read a book, eat very slowly whatever you like and can eat, because you don't get as much time when baby is here.  Although that sounds bad, it isn't, they are so worth it, I could write a book on it.  <br>  <br>  Think about what you will really need for the baby, don't buy it all at once, no matter how tempting that will be, you don't need a highchair until they are 6 months (though posh ones are from 4 months), you know in your mind what they need and don't need.<br>  <br>  As a pregnant woman, continue doing as much or as little exercise as you have already been doing.  Do not stop climbing or canoeing etc, just because you are pregnant, your body is used to the activity and it is not dangerous.<br>  <br>  Enjoy every minute, and when the baby comes, love them dearly.<br>  <br>  Congratulations to you both.<br>  x|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	To be realistic - everyone has airy fairy ideas about parenthood in the beginning and you spend too much time reading books, planning it all, buying things you will never really use etc..<br>  <br>  The reality can be different so prepare yourselves now for a really tough few months, know you will both be absoloutely knackered, probably nark at each other etc etc <br>  <br>  That said, it still is an amazing thing to happen - and once you find your feet as parents it will change your life for the better but as I say however hard you think it will be times that by 100.<br>  <br>  Also do not spend too much time worrying about the pregnancy and labour - the hard work actually starts when he or she is here.  <br>  <br>  Finally, spend as much time resting - sleep sleep sleep etc, travelling, going out or having couple time NOW - you really will not stop for the first couple of years and do try and be a team, it will make all the difference and keep a sense of humour.

Don't worry about breastfeeding, and don't let the nurses in the hospital scare you into thinking you will never do it right just because your baby doesn't want to nurse in the hospital!

You have every right to take that baby to address its needs whenever you see fit, even though people will actually complain that you do!<br>  4.  Look out, your hormones will be even more out of whack postpartum, and you will become a protective mama lioness.  :)<br>  5.  This is the most important advice:  ENJOY YOUR BABY.  Don't worry about what milestones he/she "should" be achieving, or what other competitive parents say their kids are (supposedly) doing.  Don't stress yourself out over whether your baby should have a schedule, or should be sleeping a certain amount, etc.  That will all come in due time, and if you're patient, you and your baby will figure everything out together.<br>  <br>  Parenthood is the most wonderful thing ever!  You'll have a blast, trust me.  :)|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Above anything else, enjoy the time you have to yourself, as soon as baby is here all your energy goes into caring for them.  And enjoy being pregnant, it's really a lovely time, even with the aches and pains!|`|AA12080472	i would tell myself that pregnancy is not an excuse to go all out and eat whatever i want, whenever i want and how much i want.  indulge once in a while is okay, but every 20 minutes is not appropriate.|`|xHlcnkgWaa	I would say to myself....the first three months you'll be knackered, the next 3 months will be good, you'll feel great and then the last part of the pregnancy you will feel really tired so take it easy and nothing you do to help the baby along will make a damn bit of difference, i tried everything and he came when he was ready.<br>  <br>  Also get as much sleep as you can, there's no point in getting proper clothes for them other than baby grows at such an early age, especially jeans they are so stiff that the poor babies legs just don't lay right.<br>  <br>  Accept all the help that is offered to you and make sure you make time for yourselves and not just the baby.  Good luck, it's fantastic having children.  For all the hard times and sleepless nights you have to go through, it's all worth it for that little smile xxx|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Spend as much time with your partner as you can.

CKnHMYHnaa	Anything greater than 21mm is considered viable.  If you haven't had a + OPK than you may have trouble ovulating on your own.  I also have PCOS and had to give myself an HcG shot in order for the follicles to be released.
cnK4X2sZaa	do it. riskier if you wait to have the baby too much after your d date.... the baby can have a bowel movement and get a lung infection. <br>  Congrats!!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Once you hit over 40 week mark the concern is that the placenta starts to break down and doesn't function as well.  That's why the docs look at induction when your body isn't doing any of the things that mean labor is coming.  You will also be given antibiotics when you go in for the gbs.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	i was induced at both 41 weeks it faIled and 42 it also failed so hade a c-section|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	I am not sure what gbs are. I was induced twice. They began with cervadil to soften the cervix and then pitocin via iv to begin contractions. Induction is safe as long as it is done correctly. The only major risk that I am aware of is that if the contractions come too close together and too quickly the uterus can rupture...my sister in law had this problem so they stopped the induction, waited 8 hours and began again. She then had no problems. Induction is more difficult than going in on your own b/c one minute you are not in labor then the next you are in hard labor without the gradual progression you have with normal labor. However, ther is something to be said for knowing for sure when you are in labor and when it is happening. FYI: Many doctors/hospitals will tell you that you can not have your epideral until you reach 5cm or it could stop labor BUT if you are being induced the pitocin controls the contractions and you can have the epideral as soon as the pitocin is begun. Good Luck!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I was induced at 40 weeks.  My water broke but I wasn't dilating so they gave me pitocen.  They also gave me my epidural at the same time, so I felt no pain.  Personally I didn't have a bad experience at all.  I'm curious to see what happens with this pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Do some research online about the side effects of induction.  Your Dr would only induce you if the benefits out weight the negatives.|`|l7U9dGrWaa	i was induced at 41 weeks and i was 3 Cm's dilated labor pains came fast and hard there is more risk of more intervention when you get started i had to have a emergency c section in the end and my friend that also got started had the same .good luck and i hope you go on your own.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	I was induced, and Pitocin was used, and I'm fine.  You will be fine.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I am sorry.I will pray for you.You will be fine!!!
prqrQcd1aa	I don't know that is really weird. Why would it expire earlier in NYC?? Does that mean NYC merchants are allowed to keep their coolers at a higher temp than most others or what? That is the only thing i can think of as to why it would be this way...<br>  Example: In my state the refrigeration for a cooler storing Milk has to be say 40 degrees.. Maybe in NYC it's allowed to be 45 degrees, thus making it spoil quicker.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	That is really strange. Maybe it says that on yours because you're so close to NYC. In PA we only have one. That has to be the strangest thing I've ever heard.<br>  <br>  *Amber's makes a lot of sense. My husband thinks it has to do with the amount of pollution. I don't see where that makes any sense.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	the 24 of feb on is the display to date it tell the shop there only allowed to sell them till that date  2nd ones when it becomes undrinkable<br>  <br>  sorry about spelling i'm dysleic and my spell checks not coming up grrrrr|`|OuA2cQ8haa	are you sure ones not a display date? the shop can only display the milk till the 24th but it doesn't expire till the 2nd march|`|nfzQkvqraa	Our milk only has one expiration date.  But I think it's really the sell by date so it's still good for 6 or 7 more days.  Maybe New York has stricter guidelines for milk?? I'm curious to see your answers now.|`|XL3gqhVxaa	It doesn't (at least not around here), but if it did, I imagine it would mean that one date is the "sell by" date (which is the only one printed on milk here in Nowheresville, Illinois) and the other is the date when the milk will actually go bad. I'm puzzled by the part about NYC; perhaps it has to do with environmental differences? I'm not an expert on big cities, but it may be possible that all the pollution and whatnot makes food go bad more quickly. (Sorry if that sounds dumb; I've lived in a small town my whole life and don't really know the finer details about cities, so I have no idea if that's possible or not.)|`|uC0xTgkeaa	the first is the day that the store needs to sell it by<br>  the second is the use by date

VmpkLLKJaa	Ummmm.... At 14 the only thing I was worried about being too late for was class, Friday night HS football games, dance practice, and Spongebob Squarepants marathons. Babies? Nuh-uh.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	When I was fourteen, I knew I wasn't ready for a baby physically, mentally, emotionally and financially.<br>  <br>  I'm pregnant with number one now and my partner and I are already struggling financially.<br>  <br>  So wait, because there is no way you can get a job to support yourself and a baby.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	No! I was a freshman in high school at fourteen! Why in the world would I have wanted a baby then? Woman can safely have children into their late 30s-possibly early 40s. You're not going to be single forever. And what will become of you?<br>  <br>  Let me think: you won't finish high school, you'll never have a good paying job, your parents will be watching your baby all the time, and MY tax money will be paying for YOUR welfare! Get off the computer and go play with dolls.|`|eTmmbd3laa	OK. There are way too many things wrong with this question.<br>  <br>  First of all, you're fourteen. <br>  Second, it's spelled 'baby'.<br>  <br>  How are you planning on paying for this baby? Are you going to go for help from the taxpayers? Do you have a full time job? Are you going to complete school?<br>  <br>  When I was 14, I was worried about if I finished all of my homework.<br>  Come on now.|`|ZKm894kfaa	At 14 HELL NO! You still have plenty of life left to find someone and have a family.  Think before you act.  Kids are way harder to take care of than many teens and adults think.  Be a kid for awhile, say the next 10 to 12 years.  You'll miss it later trust me.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I'm not sure that I'm reading this write. 14 years old, single and worried about it being 'to late?'<br>  <br>  honestly when I was 14 I was thinking about water skis and swimming pools not babies.<br>  <br>  Please wait. There is PLEANTY of time to have a baby later.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Why would anyone 14 want to put their whole life on hold to raise a child? There's plenty of time and fertility ahead for that. At 14 you are just getting your period and all. Why would any 14 year old want to be a single mother, it's so hard nowadays!|`|hmOidFp3aa	14 is WAY to early! You can have complications with the pregnancy and could kill yourself. Just because you have your period does NOT mean that it is ready. Finish highschool and do things from there!|`|EUTRJqCsaa	so you did mean fourteen?<br>  <br>  um, it's definitely NOT too late. you need to wait longer. you have no idea how hard it will be.|`|4kG7MqqHaa	14????? are you serious too late no, you are too young to think about it|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Why do you keep asking this question?<br>  <br>  No I wouldn't, because I'm not a moron.|`|cn91FeWcaa	14|`|Smy7Mwjsaa	what do you mean too late you are only i4|`|xGJwPMSRaa	im 14... i would NEVER do tht. why would yuhh?|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	HELL no! Too late? Are you insane?|`|96HWpdkFaa	This question is ridiculous.<br>  Children should not be having children.<br>  At 14 years old you couldn't possibly be a good mother. Maybe a good older sister..but not a good mother and theres no way you could support a baby or take care of one when your still a child yourself. So no it is a horrible idea.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Before its too late for what? Is this girl being locked in a convent for the rest of her life at age 16? Most women can have babies until they are at least mid thirties usually later and with fertility treatments even 60 year olds can give birth sometimes. Physically speaking a lot of 14year olds aren't actually even ready for pregnancy yet, there is no 'too late' at age 14 unless you have a seriously unusual medical issue. <br>  <br>  No, I would not consider this at all. I wouldn't even think of it, its delusional and irresponsible and 14 year olds are not generally capable of raising children. At 14 I was terrified of pregnancy, there's no way I would have actually wanted to have a baby or come up with this crazy idea at all.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Umm..deja vu. Didn't we just do this? <br>  Sure..why not! In fact, pop out a few all by different babby daddies and the government will pay for everything....you are young. You go, girl!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No...You are only 14. It's not too late to have children until you hit menopause in your 40's. Friggin finish school and get a job THEN worry about having kids.|`|zSABr7praa	14?  Fourteen....years old?  Most people start to worry it's too late around FOURTY.|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	No. Your fourteen. You can't even support yourself. Yeah the idea might sound fun but being single at fourteen and having a baby is way different than being single at 25 and having a baby! I don't even think fourteen year olds should be using a word like "single". Most fourteen years old are out having fun not thinking about becoming a single parent. Just think about it your parent will be the one taking on double the responsibility because of you. How are you going to buy things for the baby and how are you going to get to doctors appointments. If you are under the age of 18 at least, you shouldn't be able to because if you need help from anyone and you can't do it on your own then you shouldn't have a child. Unless there are certain circumstances. Not trying to be rude but thats insane!!!|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Ha ha that is funny - women can have babies until they reach menopause, usually in their 40's or 50's, so you have many, many years to have babies.<br>  <br>  If your friends have all had babies at 14, that means you should get some new friends!<br>  <br>  You should have babies whenever you want, providing you are in a stable married relationship, have a good education, own your own home - if you can say "Yes" to all those then you are old enough to have a baby, if not then the answer is "No".|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	I would never have though about having a baby at 14.  Is there something physically wrong with you that will prevent you from being able to have a baby at an older age?  If so you should consider adoption when you get older, and have your life more in order.|`|qitXGd0qaa	34 or 44 and single, sure. <br>  <br>  14 and single? Seriously in my opinion 100% of 14 year olds SHOULD be single and not sexually active.<br>  <br>  At 14, in most cases, you have over 20 years of fertility ahead of you.|`|7IHMjy2caa	14 and single: not a chance. There are still years and years of fertile time ahead.|`|WxEmrNAOaa	too late? at 14 years of age? why?|`|jgtfWjE4aa	um, no i wouldn't.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	um, no.
f35c51f5e331b49ab01670d8dbe59ca3aa	Yep, I know it well.  Lecturing for two hours a day with a cold is no fun (been doing it all this week), but ibuprofen and Halls eucalyptus cough drops get me through it.  If you also have congestion backed up into your auditory canal (I get that, too), something like DayQuil contains a decongestant for that and a pain reliever for your throat, so I take it instead of ibuprofen.  And I keep sucking the cough drops.|`|A3fYo8eYaa	If it's a simple cold,don't bother going to the doctor. You'll be better within a week. If your throat hurts try sucking on a sweet like Halls or soothers or strepsils. They'll make your throat feel better. Also drinking hot drinks like Tea will make your throat feel better. As for you ears, I'm not quite sure sorry.|`|BZqjBPBvaa	ok so what i do is drink water...<br>  steps<br>  1. boil water for about 10 min.<br>  2. add salt to the boiling water<br>  3. wait for about 5 min.<br>  4. gargle the water in your mouth ( don't drink it)<br>  5. do it until the water runs out|`|E6T9DPT9aa	See a doctor.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|72BNu70Faa	cough syrup maybe and ear drops or just go to the doctors|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Sound like allergies try claratin or something.|`|hp9RGv7iaa	Cough drops help.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	i suggest going to a doctor|`|cTM07yNwaa	talk to your doctor|`|v0UuWJSSaa	q-tips?<br>  drink lots of fluid?<br>  lol idn|`|dB6MR0wYaa	you should contact a otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor)|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	well when i'm sick<br>  i usually lay in bed and relax with a pillow<br>  NyQuil (medicine) is awesome, it works wonders<br>  especially for sore throats and stuffy noses<br>  another thing that relieves a sore throat is throat spray (i forgot the actual brand name, but any throat spray that is made for sore throats will relieve temporary soreness)<br>  i don't really know what you can do for itching in the ear<br>  maybe just put your finger on the outside of  each ear and try to shake it out, that may help<br>  also drink either room temperature or hot beverages <br>  that helps sore throats also!<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  feel better<br>  =)|`|7wwLbWN1aa	If it's a cold, then I suggest you keep yourself hydrated, keep cough drops handy, and a little bit of Tylenol to keep from being ache-y.
YmEGCGtnaa	gosh shes hyper, fussy, wants what she wants when she wants or theres hell to pay lol...today she threw her first real fit well actually had several but one that really struck me was when she was playing with my i-pod and i took it away from her and gave her her little toy doll to play with instead and she threw it across the room, really angrily! so funny.|`|Xc02z608aa	My son is 9 months old now.  He loves to play with mommy and daddy and grandpa and grandma.  He is determined and stubborn to a fault, but rarely throws tantrums unless he is tired.  He is sweet and funny and such a HAM!  He loves to play it up for people.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	My son is 9 months old...he is mild tempered. he will play well by himself as long as he can see mommy or daddy. he also loves to play with us. unless he is tired or hungry he hardly cries. I know we are blessed and I am almost afraid to have another baby because we got so "lucky" with this one :)|`|0nb1rQhnaa	My 8 month old son is fabulous.

She loves dirt and being dirty, playing in the mud and rain (her clothes don't like it so much lol)<br>  But on the other side, she is really sweet, she says "hi" to everyone and waves at people, she loves to give hugs to people, and she plays with her sisters fine, she loves dolls even though she's pretty boyish haha.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	My 10 month old son, he is really active. He's always on the move. He's really playful with others. He likes to go "tease" people and have them chase him. He seems to take pleasure in bumping his head on things, such as the wall and tables, even though I do try and stop him. He thinks it's funny to run around in circles until he gets dizzy and falls down. He is a terrible sleeping partner. He moves around all night looking for a comfortable position. He only cries when he's tired, hungry or has something he really wants taken away from him.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son is pretty mellow.  He still fusses from time to time, and now that he's 8 months he has moments of true baby frustration.  But he's pretty happy as long as he has some company.  It takes a lot to send him over the edge unless he's tired.
VTGm3UNBaa	I'm not sure. Your genetic superiority could be an asset to many women who crave smarter, stronger children. However, it would also introduce a smarter, strong breed of human being. It would create an elitist class and give you competition from your own offspring. Perhaps your could spread your superiority to one individual who would pass on your genes into the future once you're gone as to not be any competition. Also you could genetically infuse monkeys with your superior genes and create a monkey army to serve your every whim. That would allow you to make vast amount of money without creating a super elite class of individuals to take your resources.|`|hnICmxMoaa	O.o i just answered to your "Pregnant woman at work?" with the advice to sell your seed on e-bay if you're so sure <br>  ummm *Shifty eyes*<br>  sure go ahead..keep those gallons coming..why oh why aren't you named our era's new genius?|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Wow all of your questions are ridiculous.<br>  <br>  And I doubt any woman said that they wish they had chose you as the "stag"<br>  Hahahahaha|`|7IHMjy2caa	I wouldn't buy it.

I4a8zI1gaa	at 7 months, yes.. at 3 months?  no... definitely sounds like he has gas and something is really hurting him... <br>  <br>  the more you try to help him with other things, the more he'll probably do it because he's hurting more and more... <br>  <br>  next time, try laying him on his back, and pumping his legs towards his chest like hes riding a bike.  do it slowly and say 'shhhh' shhh.. while u do it.  chances are it'll help :)  good luck!|`|0844781bb7790202c3eef84c190b3e2daa	Sounds like colic, or a pain he has see you Doctor of Health visitor.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, this kind of display in a 3 month old is not a temper tantrum.  It could be a number of things - he could be truly distressed (gas or constipation), he could be over tired, or he could just be having one of those moments that all young babies have, where they just cry because the world is overwhelming.<br>  <br>  But I really wouldn't call any of those things a temper tantrum.  3 month olds don't have "wants" to get fussy over.  They only have needs and they express them by crying.  Sometimes the need is simply for comfort, but it is still a need.<br>  <br>  I think sometimes if parents assign "personality" traits like a bad temper too early, it can become a self-fulfilling prophesy.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	No, he does not know he is being "difficult" he only knows how to cry, and make faces/movements so he may just be entertaining himself or trying to say he is bored/tired or hungry..|`|7IHMjy2caa	He's not throwing a tantrum yet. He is angry and cannot express it any other way. So he cries until you can figure out what is wrong with him.  <br>  <br>  He may have a temper when he is older, he may not. He's still too young to tell.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Not necessarily.  Remember he can't communicate any other way right now.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	Does a bear crap in the woods?|`|AA10064551	No I don't think its a temper tantrum yet.

Good thing i always keep a checkbook inside the car . it was freezing cold and windy but though i hated the idea of taking her out when i know it is only for a couple mn , i still took my  baby in .|`|sAbah6dTaa	im like you i park the closest to the pump, i live in a town of less than 1000, so there is never a wait, and only to pay for gas, of course i leave the car running, so she's not hot/cold. and just for a split second. and if i have to write a check i already have it written out! i see nothing wrong with that.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I have three girls and if I have to stop and get gas or milk at the gas station I take all three girls in with me. <br>  <br>  You never know what could happen while you are inside paying. I will always take my girls inside I don't want anything to happen to them|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	No matter what...I still bring my daughter in to pay for gas. I refuse to leave her in the car, there's idiots out there that have sense of mind and could easily find a way of breaking and entering into your vehicle and take the car and the baby.|`|50iYxQ9Saa	NOOO! You NEVER leave your child in the car! Locked, turned off or whatever, anything can happen in only a few seconds. Wouldn't you feel terrible if something bad happened just because you didn't take your baby inside.|`|sMukgX7Xaa	No, if I don't have a credit card on me I either call and have a relative come sit with them...where I live my relatives are always clost to a gas station...or, i wait until someone is with me. I usually always have a credit card though. I don't take kids in b/c I have an 19 month old and a 2 month old so it's hard to get in and out. But, if you want a credit card...call a local bank...most banks make pre-paid cards to where you can put a set limit on it and use it like a credit card...if you have a banking acct. then you can get a free ATM card and use it to pay at the pump. Credit cards are wonderful for us moms that have to get gas at pumps.|`|UiBslwUPaa	I wouldn't recommend leaving a child of any age alone in a car even to pump gas. there has been many times that the car has been stolen with the children inside even if you lock the doors your kid can't be 100% safe. there are some states that it is illeagle to leave a child unattended in a car. i would suggest if you would have to get gas bring someone with you that can sit with the baby or leave the baby with someone and then get the baby when you are done|`|TLjNUJHLaa	Whenever I put the baby in the car and I forget something in the house, I will lock the car and run in the house quickly. I just think it a real in convenience to have to go threw the trouble to take my baby out the car and bring him out into the cold again, and my windows are tinted real dark so you really can't see in the car unless you get all up on the car and look in it.|`|QLopvWKDaa	Nope!  Even if it were safe, some one "super do gooder" might report you and you would have some 'splainin to do! cops, record blah blah<br>  <br>  Also, I saw a women at the pool one day- she accidentally locked her keys in the car with her Golden Retriever inside "just for a second"- by the time the rescue came and could break in- the poor dog had died form the heat-very very sad situation. <br>  <br>  I know it's a hassle, but before long they will be toddling in after you asking to buy them goodies!|`|bc9inzicaa	Although it would be safer for you to take the baby in, I would do the same thing as you since my baby does not need to be subjected to the gas fumes and weather.  Plus, by the time you struggle to get the baby out of the base, you could have already paid for the gas!<br>  <br>  You are parking close, locking your doors, and running in and out just to pay for gas--sounds good to me.  <br>  <br>  Lucky for me, my husband always makes sure my gas tank is full!  :)|`|W8Ljtah3aa	I understand where you are coming from, and I think that IF you are only going inside for gas and it isn't a line, then okay.<br>  <br>  I myself, don't do it, because I never know who may be watching me, and if it's crowded, I don't want anyone to see my little baby all by herself in the car.|`|1i2HuDqmaa	I leave my baby in the car to pay for gas. But i lock all the doors. Where i live there's never really a long line to pay though, so it never takes long. i think if it was gonna take a while, i'd probably take her in with me.|`|qTQ0l1vBaa	always take her in with you something could happen freak accidents happen unexpected what if the car rolled backwards!!!!!!|`|113FoyMFaa	i never, ever leave my kids out in the car.  i don't care how quick i think i'll be.|`|iim5eCLeaa	No, I never leave my baby in the car.  The reason I don't do it is because I'm afraid of what other people will think.  I realize anyone could come along and get the wrong ideas and think I'm being a negligent mother.  The last thing I want is someone calling the police because a baby was found in the car.  There was one time I forgot my cell phone in our apartment building when my baby was in the car in the parking lot.  It was only going to take me no more than one minute to get my phone.  But, because any one could find my baby there alone, and it was about 80 degrees outside, I was afraid to leave him in case someone found him. So I went through the hassle of taking him out of the car and carrying him up two flights of stairs.<br>  There have been some stories where babies have died by being left alone in the car.  Because of these unfortunate stories, I think many people have become intolerant of leaving babies alone in the car, even if you leave them for a few minutes.<br>  Considering that you lock the car and it's a quick trip, I think it would be safe to leave a baby in the car.  You just have to watch out for the people who might get the wrong idea.|`|uBAP6sqzaa	I do if someone else is in the car with her, and normally there is someone else in the car, I have 4 other kids and a husband so it's hardly ever just me and her in the car.<br>  If it is only me and her, I do take her in with me, I wouldn't want to risk anything happening.<br>  But then again if its cold or raining, it would be a hassle to get her out for 2 seconds and run inside without her getting wet or whatever, and then coming back and putting her back in a carseat and doing the seatbelt up and everything 2 seconds later. I would leave her in the car in the case.|`|zwctZ812aa	very popular question today!! I have only been on sporadically while at work and I have seen this 3 times today! To answer it though, no, I never leave my son in the car, even for a short period of time.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	No way.  It only takes a second for something to happen.  I have seen a lady get arrested for leaving her baby long enough to drop film off at an outdoor film kiosk at Costco.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  People are stupid and a car accident in a gas station can get serious.  Carjackings happen here often enough they don't make the news.<br>  <br>  I honestly find it hard to believe that if you used the intercom they wouldn't come take your money, particularly if you had exact change.  Particularly since if they run out of paper towels you can use the intercom and they will come give you more|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	nope I always take both of my kids in with me they are 4 and 11 weeks. there are always people looking for an opportunity to kidnap children and locked doors won't stop them if they are desperate enough for me it is always better to be safe then sorry|`|0nb1rQhnaa	No I don't, but I am more worried about the cops coming after me for being a bad parent. My husband does though, and I hate that. But he does lock the doors.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	Never!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anything could happen in a split second..please take your baby in next time.
SJx9IWWtaa	Maybe your were coming home and he didn't have enough time to read it?  So he took a picture?  lol<br>  <br>  No on really knows WHY people doing things.  It does sound like he is worried about you.  Maybe because you haven't been talking to him about your boyfriend he feels the need to find out by himself.  <br>  <br>  You said it yourself " i barely talk about him to my dad."  So how is your dad supposed to know whats going on?  When parents get pushed out of the loop they can get a bit crazy because they are worried. <br>  <br>  If there was nothing dirty in the card, then who cares if he read it.|`|kprKXEOSaa	As long as you are living under your parent's roof and eating their food and asking them for 5 bucks, you have no "personal stuff."  When you move out and get an apartment and a job and take 100% responsibility for yourself, then your dad will have no say about what you do and will have no right to snoop through your room.  Until then, clean up your room, toe the line, and show some respect.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	He is your father and he has the right to go into your room because you are living in his home and you are his daughter. Father's are very protective when it comes to their little girls. Ever since that day that he held you in his arms, the world became a scarier place. He just doesn't want anything bad to happen to you. He probably won't like any guy that you bring home because he has the instinctive feeling like they are going to take you away or hurt you, or break your heart.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well im taking it your dad helps pay the bills...so hed expect you to take care of the room hes paying for you. tidy up its not hard at all! as for the boyfriend he has ood reason to dislike him if my daughter was dating a bad egg id be displeased, and worried.|`|OuA2cQ8haa	your daddy loves you , why don't you stop being a know it all teen and respect your daddy that he knows best and your bf is no good|`|9IFF0vIoaa	He's your dad.  He's trying to watch out for you.  If *my* child were hanging out with someone that got her in trouble, I would not like him either.  If he was disrespectful to me...that would be another strike against him.<br>  <br>  If you want your dad to treat you differently, then you need to act differently.  Clean up your room!  Seriously, how hard would it be to give it a good clean, then do maintenance every day when you get up...or right before bed.  He might be taking pics for "proof".  I dunno...that's a little bizarre...but even though you see it as your "personal" stuff...remember it's his home.  If you didn't live there, would you have the things you have & the roof over your head?  The best way to get along with parents is to be honest with them about your life.  He might be taking pictures to get more "info" on your life!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	a lot of parents feel like its their house so they can go through their children's stuff as much as they want to. and if they don't like it they can leave. its just something you have to deal with my mom tapped our phone calls when i was younger, so don't feel bad.|`|PKtqcw5yaa	wow. mean dad. you should tell your dad that you really like your boyfriend so could he back off. you understand that your dad doesn't like him and tell him that, he might understand if you explain why you like him so much.|`|wzWAqtReaa	hes your dad he feels he has to protect you. you sound young from what you have written. Let me tell you, your dad is prob the only man you will ever be able to trust because boys will break your heart.|`|ZTRakv6maa	go get knocked up! that'll show him. hahaha
31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	Uh what?|`|SslNP4qdaa	The girlfriends name is MISTY CROSLIN.... Crystal is the girls biological mother, and I dont think she had anything to do with  Haleighs disappearance... THE Girlfriend on the other hand sounds like she knows more than she is telling, but I dont think she did anything with Haleigh herself...maybe someone she knows could have...<br>  Watch this video of "WHY THE KIDS LIVE WITH THE FATHER AND HIS 17 YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND..... isn't that statutory rape?????<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.truecrimereport.com/2009/02/nancy_graces_interview_with_cr.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.truecrimereport.com/2009/02/n...</a>|`|0b59c347b366439bc483ccb060f2eee5aa	I think the girlfriend may of had something to do with it.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	My gut screams so. At the very least there was something going on at that house she knows about. Like maybe she had some friends over the bf wouldn't approve of. Maybe some shady people he wouldn't want around his kids? So she's not saying anything because she'd get in trouble for having people over while he wasn't home. Something.<br>  Those folks aren't saints, I can tell you that. They look like some of my friends. And I know, when the sun goes down they party. Just who was really there that night.
PRzmwFfgaa	Replay the situation with him.  Ask him.... "Were you playing with ____"  and when they say yes, ask them what happened.  Go through a play by play of what happened until you get to the hitting.  Then say "Is that why you hit ______?"|`|UYfqzCoMaa	If you know why it happened then give him hints such as in "were you trying to clean something?" That's what I did with my daughter and she gets it now.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	That's tough.  I would have the child tell you what was happening before the incident happened.  And then ask, what happened next?  Try role playing what happened?  I would also practice showing and explaining in every day life how things happened and why.  Eventually they'll understand.<br>  <br>  Good luck, mom!|`|fRYQfvNaaa	He does not know why, he does not understand reasoning and emotions the way you do.  He is a child, he acts by instinct, he does not yet question why.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Ozark Woman gives good advice, because at 4 he should understand what why means. Then again he may not know exactly what you mean when you say 'why did you do that?' Start by asking him why he did things that are not bad, and see if he understands. If not, then:<br>  <br>  Teach him using tangible examples that he will understand. Tell your child "I am thirsty. What do you think I should do?" He will say, get a drink- if he doesn't volunteer say, "I know, I will drink some water." So go get some water and drink it. Then ask him, why did I drink the water? He should be able to figure that out easy enough. <br>  <br>  Tell him, "I am happy. What face should I make?" He will say, smile! And then you can ask him, "why was mommy smiling?" He will say, because you are happy. Say, "if I were sad, what would I do, what face would I make?" etc.<br>  <br>  Move on to other things that he can understand that involve a person's motivation for doing things. "You were such a nice boy to help fold the laundry. You deserve a sticker." then after you give it to him ask  "why did I give you the sticker?" make sure he understands the answer- because you helped mommy with the laundry, like a good boy<br>  <br>  Easy- if you work with him he will understand what it means when you ask "why did you do that?"|`|jij9Fa9waa	4 years old is getting to an age of understanding right from wrong, therefore, they may be trying to stay out of trouble. If your child hit someone or something, you might ask, "honey what were you doing or thinking when you hit timmy", "did he say or do something that you did not like", get him to talk about what set him off.<br>  As far as the water on the floor, hey they are 4 years old be glad they wash their hands! Just tell him if he gets water on the floor to wipe it up so nobody can slip and hurt themselves, and try and not turn the water on so much when he washes. He will get it, just have patients and try reasoning with him.
pXSKSS3daa	Lol. Sorry about that, I didn't even see yours or I wouldn't have asked! :)<br>  <br>  Anyway, my day hasn't been so well. Noah has been having a temp. of 101-102 so I'm keeping an eye on that and he's also been sleeping most of the day which is unusual for him. :( I hope he's just teething, AGAIN, and that it's not anything else.|`|KWHiJbhaaa	My days good, just got my house cleaned and my son is napping, the girls I sit for left about an hour ago. i'm pretty happy to have some down time|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	It's going okay, but my little boy always seems to make it better.

lSiv5PDlaa	haha think like a carsalesman <br>  if your in the mindset i can get a snail to (respectively)eat salt  then you can sale anything,confidence is key!<br>  firstly map out hot spots around town where potential customers wander, even strangers, make sure you have their number listed though! HIT FAMILY FIRST, ESPECIALLLY IF OTHER FAM IS SELLING IT ALWAYS SUCKS TO HEAR I ALREADY BOUGHT FROM SO AND SO<br>  places to keep in mind:<br>  work<br>  school (teachers, even if you dont know 'em)<br>  hair salons<br>  local buisness,like finance places or restraunts W/E<br>  send it to work with TRUSTED family members too<br>  <br>  THATS THE JUST OF IT HOPE I HELPED!|`|NAumiQiXaa	Try these and see if you get any buyers:<br>       1.  Use e-mail to sell to family and friends...It's a little less scary to<br>            do it this way as you're not actually having to approach <br>            someone face-to-face and ask them to buy. Don't forget your <br>            Parent(s) friends.  If you don't have access to internet...Then try <br>            using the free internet at the library to send out your e-mails.<br>       2.  Ask your Parent(s) if they will take your goods/order sheet to <br>            work with them and get orders for you.<br>       3.  With a responsible adult, go door-to-door in your neighborhood <br>            selling...I buy from the neighborhood kids all the time...Just <br>            because I've seen them out and about and want to help them <br>            out.<br>       4.  If you're selling for your school, or a non-profit organization, <br>            many grocery stores and banks will let you sell your goods on <br>            the sidewalk in front of their business.  In California...places like <br>            Albertons/Ralphs/Stater Brothers (Grocery Stores) as well as <br>            WalMart and Bank of America all allow you to do this if you just <br>            ask permission from the manager before doing it.  The bank is <br>            especially good on a Friday afternoon/Saturday morning...or the<br>            beginning of the month when people are more likely to have just<br>            been paid/have money...and they're already at the place where <br>            they keep the money.<br>  <br>  I have much experience with peddling goods with my kids for their fundraisers...These are some ideas that worked for them...Hope this helps.
B7NPXRoqaa	Just work a bit on History. BTW, what is MODERN history? It seems like a oxymoron. How can you have modern history? ha ha. Might want to study a bit more for Math too, but its not urgent. It is just a very important subject. Don't worry about art. Unless you want to get an art degree in an art college, it doesn't matter all that much. Good job!|`|c2a0BgWraa	I think you're grades are pretty good. If I were your mom I would be cool with them. I would like to know why you have a D in history and a C in Art; but I wouldn't fret too much.  My biggest problem would be the D.|`|nZjyIAVhaa	Very good! <br>  Well done. <br>  <br>  I admire your A in French! Although you have got a few poorer marks, your good marks are in hard subjects (French, Science etc). <br>  <br>  xx|`|oGHtaaCkaa	They're great. <br>  Maybe get some extra help in math and history.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	work on english math and history, its ok but not to good|`|jHUAfrojaa	Not trying to sound like a rude person but my parents don't accept anything lower than an "A" so if you lived with me, you wouldn't be able to use the computer, watch television, or have a cell phone until ALL of those grades were up.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	I totally understand your struggles with Math.<br>  <br>  You've got a good balance of As and Bs in there... one D, but you have time to bring it up.

h4GiHU4jaa	hi,<br>  i am a single mom.  I remember trying for a while to get pregnant.  Everyone kept telling me to just relax,..but that had nothing to do with it.  we were doin it ever nite, every other, every three...forever, that it took the "love" out of love making.  it was a chore.  people kept saying take a break,...but there is no time when the clock is ticking!  I wanted a baby sooooo badly .<br>  it turns out that my (now ex) was extremelt infertile.  we were gonna adopt and instead did ivf. it took on the first try.  but all i wanted to experience was passionate love making and then an "oops,...i am pregnant" moment.  i was jeleous of everyone who just did it and got pregnant.  it was the worst when i'd hear people complain about their symptoms.   i was to the point where i wanted to find a sperm doner!!!<br>  So after i took the many negative tests,..it was like being in school and being a failure on ever test given. I felt like sex was like running on a treadmill and never burning calories!<br>  So now my son is 7...and after a while we adopted a little girl from S. Korea/ an amazing experience.  I loved every bit of it.  it took under a year fro strat to finish and we had her escorted to us.  I loved it. I'd do both again.  But now i am a single mom of two.  I had an amazing boyfriend for almost a year and we "accidentally" got pregnant (no protection) I loved it but we lost the baby.  we are split up for now. but I'd still give anything to be pregnant again.  I hate the losing of the weight part after, but being pregnant is natural for us to want to experience.<br>  chat back!!!<br>  Dawn|`|RrdvmgE1aa	No your not alone, i been with the same guy for 2 years and im not pregnant ive been having un protected sex since i was 13 and im now 18 and not pregnant, so its kinda weird, but i made a appt for gyno and we will see, just dont stress over it, its harder to conceive than people think.. but the funny thing is, all these cracked out whores are getting pregnant, so why dont we who really wanna be try crack?? lol im just kiddign but forreal.|`|DRiSewgTaa	yes i am in the same situation. me and my husband have been trying for over 2 years. i have had one miscarriage and that's it.

I hate it so much. So your not the only one out there. well good luck and i hope everything turns out ok. Lots of Baby Dust|`|TmYwUdFLaa	You are not alone.

After a year or so, talk and see if you both want and are ready for another child.  Once that one is born and older, talk again and see where you both end up.

Then I had one...and that number dropped to 3.  Now I have 2...and I am still unsure if I want a third!  So your mind may change as well.  I would just say to go with the flow for now.  Once you have your first baby, decide how you feel after a few months of sleepless night, spit up, & poop!  It's not all giggles & roses.<br>  <br>  :)  You likely won't change his mind...but if all else fails, you might compromise & have 2...then wait a few years and try fostering.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Well you might not want more kids after you have just one so why dont you have a child to start with then go from there.|`|nNGJY8tKaa	tell him that u really love kids and u can handle 4|`|GuzZdOEWaa	Have one or two first. I have a feeling you will change your mind when you see on a daily basis how time-consuming and stressful kids really are. If after two kids you want more talk him into it. Who knows you might be the one who doesen't want anymore when he's willing to have 10 more. <br>  <br>  When I was a kid I always said I wanted twenty kids. Now I'm content with two.|`|BiepGfSPaa	......hmm try to convince him.  If he doesn't give in after a while just simply seduce the man at night.  I am a guy myself.  He will have a hard time resisting since he finds you attractive (obviously).  After the .......blah, if you get pregnant let him know and say it was that night.  He won't' be like get an abortion (that is, if hes a descent person), and just go with it.

5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Lisa, wow, you have a good grasp what is going on with your child, so kudos to you!<br>  From reading everything, I'm wondering if she is simply bored - so she is zoning out and daydreaming. My son used to do this at that age - once he was given more enriching schoolwork to do, and challenged more, things were much better. He ended up testing years above grade level (he was reading by 4), so was later in gifted/talented programming. However, we just had to ensure we were enriching him at school, and he was lucky to be in a good school with great teachers who were doing the same.<br>  We did have huge organizational problems with him (always the forgetting of books, schoolwork, notes, etc.), but those were solved by having the cooperation of teachers to have a daily homework book which had to be signed by both teacher and parent daily.<br>  I would think before any testing was done by the doctor, you should have some investigation done by the school division's educational psychologist, who can easily and quickly do some testing of your daughter.<br>  To truly diagnose ADD/ADHD, it needs much more than a checklist from a teacher or doctor, and really has to involve seeing a neurologist, psychologist/psychiatrist, nutritionist, etc. to have serious, complicated testing done. <br>  So for now, maybe talk to the teacher, and the principal about getting the school psychologist involved - usually some sort of academic testing is done at the grade one level anyway, so she won't feel put out by having anything like that done.<br>  And, most of all, you need to work on her and her behaviour. Some things are MUSTS - she must conform at school (don't grit your teeth, I can see you!) - there are times when she can be creative (like the magnets thing), but there are times when it's not appropriate, or there is no time for it. Also, about respecting other students (the pants) and property of anyone else (writing on walls). These are all pretty serious things which you really need to instill in her much more.<br>  Ah, good luck to you. I have more to say, but my arms are sore from typing already!|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Since you are pursuing the ADHD possibility, I would like to give you another possibility.....she may be "gifted."  You say she can do 2nd grade work already, so it could be possible.<br>  <br>  Some gifted children are socially awkward (getting back her book by pulling on pants), feel that the school work is boring or beneath them and thus won't try, will sometimes give wrong answers to make school more interesting, and a bunch of other things.<br>  <br>  It's another avenue to pursue in order to assist your daughter in being the best she can be.|`|AA10529334	Ask the school to move her to another classroom. If these behaviors go away then it was the teacher - or another classmate , if not, then perhaps you need to have her checked out. I agree this does not sound like ADD to me.|`|NMjM2X4taa	ADD is VASTLY over rated and over diagnosed. what the schools want are robots that are high on medication so they can only function in a certain range. they don't want kids to think for themselves and they don't want kids to have an imagination.  I agree that this does not sound like ADD and I would move her to another classroom. if that doesn't solve the problems then you need to take her out in public more and teach her how to act. (I'm not saying you haven't, I'm just saying she may need more social interaction to learn what is acceptable)|`|pnL5WTXMaa	she actually sounds like she has the mind of a very creative individual. teachers try to discourage that - make no mistake- if they don't follow the herd, they must have ADD - no teacher is qualified to make that diagnosis but they often try. <br>  <br>  however, it does sound like there is a behavior problem at school and children must follow the rules. blaming the school or teacher seldom helps the situation. you could have a meeting with school officials and come up with a plan. find out the teacher's view on behavior management. perhaps the teacher could be doing something more proactively (they tend to not want to do that though since they are not trained in behavior management). don't let your child think though for a second it's you against them. you want her to know you're all on the same team. maybe something else is going on with your daughter and she just can't verbalize it. good luck.<br>  <br>  edit* sombra - actually i am qualified, but without actually observing the child a diagnosis cannot be made (particularly with this little bit of information).|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Sorry, Mom ... <br>  <br>  That's ADHD (the term ADD is no longer used).<br>  <br>  OK, I'm not a doctor and I can't diagnose your child (neither can anyone else here), but what you're describing does sound like a kid with ADHD at the VERY LEAST.<br>  <br>  Yes, you need to have her evaluated.  The sooner she is diagnosed and begins treatment, the better for her AND the teacher AND the other students.<br>  <br>  ADHD kids can be incredibly disruptive in the classroom, and other kids quickly develop a dislike toward them.<br>  <br>  School is a vastly different world from home.  A lot of ADHD kids display none or few of the problem behaviors at home, or only show them in certain situations at home.  At school, they can become overstimulated by all the bright colors, happy decorations, noise, activity, etc. and experience sort of a "sensory overload" ... this contributes to the lack of focus, inappropriate behaviors, fidgeting, inability to sit still or pay attention ...  The end result is that the child gets labeled a "problem student" ... and that leads to social isolation.|`|AA12148387	Your daughter may just want attention. Tell her she has to behave at school and everywhere else.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	Hope everything goes well...I'm a mom, a teacher and a grown-up with ADD.  From a parent and teacher perspective, I know what you mean that sometimes it's easy to throw that out whenever there's a problem and without knowing your child or what's going on, it's hard to say.  You know your child best and you know whether you think there's something going on with her or with the situation (teacher/classroom).  It sounds like things aren't great for her at school at the moment, regardless of the cause.  You might consider a different school (if it's possible) or a different teacher or at the very least a conversation with the principal about your concerns.  Principals usually want to make parents happy so as long as you approach the conversation in a calm and logical way with a "I'm sure we just all want the best for everybody," hopefully things can be resolved to everybody happy.<br>  When I was a kid, I never really had a hard time academically because (like your daughter) I often was ahead of the game with the academic work and wasn't hyperactive in school.  I had a horrible time staying organized, daydreamed in class and had a hard time when I got older staying on top of assignments and keep stuff neat and organized.  Before I was diagnosed, I felt horrible about myself because I thought that when I screwed up it was because I wasn't trying hard enough.  It made it worse because I was smart, so why couldn't I do this?  It may sound badly to you but I was relieved to know that there was something that I had, not a flaw in my character.  Does your daughter seem to be inattentive?  Does her teacher say that she seems to have a hard time focusing?  Does she have a harder time than your other kids in keeping the stuff organized and bringing stuff home?  Does she have a hard time keeping her room neat (not out of defiance or disobedience but because it seems to be having a harder time of it)?  Good luck!|`|OjlaQNibaa	lol<br>  she funny what she said about rosa parks. she Little let her be. tell sheshould behaver they think i have adhd but they wont give the pills for and am doing fine so just let her be.  some people think i have an attudite problems and staff but they can deal with it

Don't have children if bedtime is too much work for you.<br>  I am not advocating letting your child walk all over you but, seriously?  at eight months?  You can try the "no cry sleep solution" which i put a link to in the source area or you can always try co sleeping.  <br>  Also, instead of rocking her to sleep, what if you just sit by her bed/crib so she will feel secure that you are there but, not be in your arms.  then you can gradually make your way out the door over a few nights.  It would help give her what she needs and give you what you need too.<br>  Don't feel compelled to listen to all the non-parents on here saying to just toss her int eh crib and let her scream.  they don't know what they are talking about.

Simply using the phonetic spelling doesn't change the fact that it's a horrible name and not the least bit feminine.

I used that site and it was pretty accurate.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Don't stay in this relationship for the sake of your son. I have worked, owned a house had two kids. Got divorced and lived of benefits. Currently due to no work for my new partner who has sold two businesses to be with me and gained no money on either I am currently on Income based Job seekers allowance. I don't want to live off the state but I have no choice. My partner claims for me my two kids. I don't work as Im a full time mum with another on the way. He cant get a job due to his complex C.V and he has two C.Vs for different employers. I have been on Income support and also have worked part time. When I was single on Income support they paid my rent and council tax. Luckily I worked 4 hours a week and earned ￡20 as you can earn that much on benefit. I tried to do 16 hours to better myself but after paying a percentage of rent as I worked part time and my council tax and bills I was left with pittance at the end of the month. If your partner works and you split you will have to involve the C.S.A. Some men say they will always pay for their kids but when you split they don't. I know my ex hubby is like that! Gave up work so he wont pay maintenance! My partner pays to his 2 kids and doesn't see them out our benefit money. I know it sounds terrible but weigh the pros and cons up of going onto full benefit for the time being.<br>  <br>  Income support offers you...<br>  <br>  Rent paid, council tax paid, reduced health benefits inc swimming. Free school meals when they are at school. May be your employer will let you work for ￡20 a week. That way you don't have to tell any one you are on benefit. You would still get tax credits too and vouchers for your son under the healthy start scheme. More time with your son.<br>  <br>  Working and tax credits offer you.<br>  <br>  Amount of rent to pay, amount of council tax to pay, depending on your income reduced swimming, school meals. Less time with your son.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im not advising you to pack your job in just consider the other option for a while.<br>  <br>  You never no you may meet another prince in the future who can offer you so much more!

You need time to be completely independent and free and chase a few dreams before you become a mother.|`|kHx1upOpaa	if you do you can kiss your life good bye, kids don't make people happy just stressed out. At least wait until you graduate from college with a good job and are married.|`|wqrycWlEaa	No, of course not!<br>  You will screw your life up forever<br>  Wait another 10 years!|`|AA11850523	wait until you have a <br>  home<br>  career<br>  get married <br>  are older|`|igI5yX0vaa	Yes, and it's the good parents who worry about if they are doing enough and the right thing.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	You need to both get a job and wait til your at least 22.  Babies are expenseive (talking 60 to 100 dollars a week just on one baby) then you have rent utilities babysitters  and necessities for your self too|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Yes and no. It is a great thing to make sure you both have steady jobs, money in the bank, and that you both want the same thing. BUT you need to give yourselves time to grow up and think about all the other things that you want to do before children. (College, traveling, partying) I'm 21 years old, live with my boyfriend of 3 years, both have stable jobs that we've had over a year, planning on getting engaged soon (I know cause I'm sneaky that way, hehe), and I am just now thinking that we may be ready in 6 months to a year to start trying for a baby. By then I'll be 22 and he'll be 25 years old. <br>  Trust me, if you don't live a little before you have kids, you won't be as happy as you could be.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	You need more than money. You need to establish yourself into the adult world, which takes a few years at best. Life throws some real challenges at young adults and some are very costly both financially and emotionally. <br>  Also, you are still physically growing. Even though the bulk of puberty is behind you, there's still some final adjustments your body is going through. If you think the hormones you have now make you feel crazy sometimes, that is NOTHING compared to the whole slug of hormones that comes with getting pregnant!<br>  Add that to still trying to adjust to the adult world and there will be a world of frustration that can only make an unhealthy home for the baby to live in. <br>  Please wait on this! I was 21 and married when I had my first child. We had some money and jobs, but we were still very immature and still figuring out adulthood. It made for a disastrous marriage, financial ruin, and my kids have needed therapy. <br>  I love my kids dearly and do not regret having them, but I do regret the hell I put them through mainly from the fact that I had not established myself as an adult before having them.|`|t0mb150gaa	yes that is a good plan as well as waiting till your finished school and have a plan for your life. Having a child is hard work but it is also very rewarding, you are very young and want to make sure you have gotten what you want out of life before you commit to becoming a mother so that there will be no regrets. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders with knowing you need to be financially stable so just think about the rest of what i have said.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea its a good plan but finish school<br>  have 2k saved up before baby is born to buy baby stuff<br>  about 2500/month to be able to scrape by living on your own. Comon your to young to throw your life away intentioanly. I mean if you get pregnant unintentionaly then ok but dont screw your lives up so young, trust me odds are you two wont last, Ive been there and done that
rMgnmMN9aa	DO NOT GET "What to expect when expecting" I know it's not a parenting book but people always suggest it and I hated it personally. <br>  <br>  I have a one year old boy and the BEST parenting book i've ever owned iis called "Baby 411" by Denise Fields and Ari Brown, M.D. you can get a package deal that comes with toddler 411 also that's what I have.<br>  <br>  It answers the simplest of questions to the most complex and tells you which things your told are "facts" and which are "wives tales" you'll absolutely LOVE IT guaranteed!|`|n2O0NwR6aa	One of my favorites is "The Five Love Languages of Children" by Gary Chapman.  It explains how everyone expresses and understands love through one of five different communication styles - and how to recognize your child's "love language" so you can communicate with them in the way they best understand.  There's one for teens and adults, too - they're all great!<br>  <br>  Another one I liked is not so well-know: it's called "Spoiled Rotten" by Fred Gosman.  The author is not a doctor or psychologist - just a regular dad who makes some very good observations about how giving your child so much can actually rob him of so much more.  He makes a lot of really good points and I think every parent should read it - even if you don't think you spoil your child!|`|9IFF0vIoaa	I recently read "Have a New Kid by Friday" and it was really helpful.  It's very upfront & not too 'touchy feely'.  It talks about how kids DO misbehave & that behavior needs to be dealt with.  It also talks about how a parents attitude & behavior can directly affect the child's attitude & behavior.  I think that's an important thing to remember...b/c a child is learning from their parents.  If there is consistent misbehavior...then maybe it's time for the parent to look at themselves.|`|s37fnYJ4aa	I agree with the first answerer about "What to Expect when You Are Expecting".  <br>  <br>  My two favourite parenting books were "Children are From Heaven" by John Gray (not as corny as it sounds... it's not religious, either) and "How to Raise a Happy Unspoiled Child".   Some very good practical advice in both of those.<br>  <br>  Here is a great link (not a book, but very enlightening article) ...<br>  <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/all-they-need-is-love-20080729-3msg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/all-the...</a>|`|AA11327039	Stephanie Wilder-Taylor has written two books that I highly recommend.  The first is Sippy Cups are not for Chardonnay and the other one is Nap Time is the New Happy Hour|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I personally like "Natural baby and child care" By Dr Lauren Feder. It's got pretty much everything you need to know about babies and kids.  "Unconditional Parenting" By Alfie Kohn. "The continuum Concept" By Jean Liedloff. <br>  There are many others. Dr. Sears has good books.
oHNrktxTaa	I know how frustrating that is. It amazes me how I have been ttc these past months, & feel like everyone around me is pregnant! I am truly happy for them & all, but cant help to feel a little jealous. <br>  <br>  I think it is completely normal & all. I do believe to try & relax, stay calm & be positive will truly help.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck & baby dust!|`|BhYDTUrWaa	be happy for your friend its not her fault that she is fertile that's her problem if she doesn't take care of her kids as long as she don't pawn them off on you then you have a problem|`|XUHb158Baa	hell yeah.  It is not wrong to think there are many unfair things in life.  Life is completely unfair!!  But don't obsess on it because that just deminishes the value of other things in your life that are very fruitful.
5ZvALiclaa	raid your kitchen cupboards...my 7 mth old son loves to play with 'toys' that aren't really toys. <br>  Like kitchen utensils, pots, pans, baking trays, empty toothpaste boxes, toothbrushes and my car keys are his FAVE toy! <br>  Just give her a couple of things at a time and as she gets bored of them give a the next things.<br>  Also if you have a safe wet area that you can watch her close to you, why not strip her down to her nappy and fill some smalls bowls and cups with a little water and let her play. babies love water so it should keep her occupied for a while. <br>  <br>  It probably won't work for more than an hour, as babies will still want their mums attention but it might buy you some time until she goes off for her next sleep.<br>  <br>  good luck on your paper|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Give her pots and pans?<br>  <br>  Mix cornstarch and food dye to make finger paint and let her go nuts (when it dries you can just vacuum it up, unless your vacuum caught fire like mine did earler)<br>  <br>  Take an empty plastic jar and put some things in it that she normally wants but can't have because they are too small, put the lid on tight (obviously keep her where you can check she can't get the lid off)<br>  <br>  Take a quick trip to a dollar store and buy some new toys?|`|xyrSl2nSaa	put her in a playpen with some toys... she will be fine, she will probably cry but after about 10 minutes she should get over it|`|acj9mB9Paa	Ooo, girl.  You need a jumpy!!  Kept my baby busy when I HAD to be something done!!|`|tBx1M0g9aa	okay um... give her some toys maybe....call your parents or inlaws and ask for help.Um.....let the baby sit on your lap until she gets maybe a little sleepy and then put her in her crib?.Oh do you have one of those playpins?Pu t he in one of those|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Play pen - use it for short periods of time, and your daughter will get used to it.|`|QCWGObuuaa	No child under 18 months should be exposed to the tv.... just lay her in her crib and let her play in bed she will eventually get tired and sleep put soft toys and such even nice calming sounds or music|`|UXhFcHCHaa	playpen, saucer, jumper? can you put her in any of these?|`|osXURDjraa	You need to put her in a play pen or a baby bouncer, baby gym, something that really occupies a baby. Or try and sooth her to sleep :P|`|5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	Does she have a baby swing.. bouncy seat.. or playpen??  Try that..|`|eQthqZKwaa	you should buy one of those bouncy activity jumpers. They dont take up much room, they are stationary seats that you put your baby into and it has toys attached to them to keep them busy. If they have lots of energy many of them allow your baby to jump up and down safely in them. The one I have is from Baby Einstein, its called "Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper." I got mine online at babiesRus.com. Its pricey but its worth it for times like this when you need to get something done. There are other ones that are cheaper. I dont recommend putting the baby in there all day long, but for 15-30 min a couple times a day, I think is ok.|`|rlDDTtAoaa	Don't let your baby "cry it out." What exactly is "it" that is cried out? I think it's her hope and sense of worth. Trust me on this, my mom is a firm believer in crying it out and not one of us got out of that without issues, and there are 7 children. Now with that said, you are a mother. Even if you don't work best at night, if you've put it off till then that's when it has to be done. You could have used her naps. She shouldn't suffer because you didn't do what was a good medium.<br>  <br>  I second letting her play in the cabinets. Kids love that. I let my son play in the spice drawer while I work in the kitchen. He has a blast. Plus these "toys" are special and not always played with. This is great if you can't afford the bouncy things.|`|nAXmkl3Zaa	try putting her in her carseat with either a toy or turn the tv on|`|oUtEVKDHaa	my baby loves her jumparro<br>  she is also 7 months she'll stay there for a while

Then one night I had some chocolate ice cream and it kicked me hard 'cause it wanted more, I guess.|`|fHgbL046aa	I was 5 or 6 months pregnant when I felt anything with my first pregnancy. I am 19 weeks and 6 days pregnant and haven't felt anything. It feels like butterflies or gas it doesn't hurt. When the kicking and punching begins you will know and maybe see body parts sticking out when you are further along. The kicking and punching can be uncomfortable when the baby is doing it while you sleep LOL.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	At 18 or 19 weeks I was feeling flutters and now that he is head up Im really feeling him step on my bladder.

1KIwM1uOaa	I always tell my kids if it hurts cry and if you are mad talk about it.  My husband is one of those who never shows emotion, when his grandpa died he never cried, when our daughter was seriously hurt by a horse he didn't blink and I do not want my son growing up that way.  More than once our kids have asked if he cares because he doesn't show emotion.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well I don't think ENCOURAGING them to cry is the better alternative but certainly not criticizing expression of feelings, if that includes crying, is not a good idea to do with children regardless of their gender.  You are right that society raises BOYS to be uncomfortable with the expression of their feelings and then we complain that men don't share or aren't in touch with their feelings - really a bad pathetic double standard if you ask me.<br>  <br>  I have 4 kids. I have NEVER criticized any of them for expressions of emotion - unless they were out of control and were expressing hateful negative anger or FITFUL emotions - then I tried to help them TEMPER those emotions into words that EXPRESSED what they felt instead of blatant outbursts of emotionalism that was irrational and misunderstood.  I have 1 son and 3 daughters.  They are ALL deeply FEELING people and interestingly enough it is my 2nd from the oldest daughter and NOT my son who refuses to let herself FEEL and EXPRESS things. SO even when we try to do things the right way as parents - some kids still have issues!<br>  <br>  But YES you are right - being able to express ourselves rationally and recognize and express our feelings and emotions is a VERY healthy and good thing to help children learn how to do and be comfortable with.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	They shouldn't be encouraged to cry all the time, they should just stop being told that crying is bad because the kid will think there is something wrong with them when they do cry.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I think that there is a difference between being encouraged to cry and being allowed to feel their emotions even those that cause crying.  I think that males of all ages aren't allowed to feel the softer emotions because supposedly men are strong and feeling pain and grief are supposed to be "soft" and there for feminine.  What most people don't think about is that women are as strong or stronger than a lot of men.  There for feminine emotion's aren't weak.  More women are single parents because of the desertion of men than vise versa.  More women take care of their families than men do children, husband and parents. Yes men would be better off if encouraged to express their emotions no matter what they are. In fact society would be better off as a whole if men were encouraged to do so more often.  So it's up to us to raise our boys better than our parents did our brother's.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I don't think kids should be told not to cry just because they are a boy.<br>  <br>  BUT they shouldn't be encouraged to cry about everything.  If a kid is thirsty and has a cup of water available to them, should they cry just because they want mommy to get it for them?   No, they should get up and get the water.  <br>  <br>  That's what we focus on with our child.  Is crying going to fix the problem?  If not, then stop crying.  Sometimes it does fix the problem, if someone hurts your feelings sometimes crying can make you feel better without taking it out on someone else.   But if you fall down and bump your knee and just lay on the floor and cry instead of telling someone you bumped your knee...no one can help make it feel better.<br>  <br>  I hope I made my point.  I get irritated when parents let their kids scream and cry for everything because its their way of "expressing" themselves...if the kids not a baby then they are  too old.|`|OuA2cQ8haa	kids should be able to cry if they need too , no matter about gender but what pissed me off as a kid was the kid who used to cry to get everyone into trouble<br>  <br>  crying fine = attention seeking no|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I will never tell my son not to cry. If he's hurt then I would want him to come to me and cry on my shoulder if he needs to. My husband expresses how he feels. Although I have only seen him cry twice in the 4 years that we have been together. I believe that children and adults have a reason why we are feeling the way that we are and I am never going to mock my children or make them feel like less of a person just for the way that they feel. It's better to find out why they feel the way that they do and correct the problem.|`|s37fnYJ4aa	LOL, your question is worded a bit funny... <br>  <br>  You don't need to encourage a child to cry.  They do it naturally.  <br>  <br>  Personally, kids cry when they are scared.  A lot of the time, kids fall over and hurt themselves and a parent looks so alarmed that they start to cry.  I always say "Splat" when my kids fall over, in a joking way.  Sometimes they laugh and get up.  Other times it really hurts and they cry and then I comfort them and fix their hurt (eg. kissing it usually works, lol).<br>  <br>  I don't think kids should be encouraged to cry.  Some mothers create their own whiny kids by being too anxious about them.  I think kids should be encouraged to feel whatever it is that they will feel without undue interferance from their parents.  Then, if they do cry, they should be hugged and comforted until they feel better.<br>  <br>  But parents should be careful not to act in ways that artificially induces kids to cry.|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	I always tell me son to cry it out. My husband used to think I was making him wimpy till I showed him an article about how it helps boys become better at communicating. Sometimes though regardless of gender a parent doesn't want their children crying because they just want them to be quiet. Yea they should be encouraged to cry it out when they start.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i agree with you. i think it is terrible to tell little boys that its wrong to cry. i caught my little boy holding it in one time, and it about broke my heart. i told him that if he ever needs to cry, its ok. there isnothing wrong with it. i agree with you for the exact reasons as well. <br>  there is nothing wrong with a man that cries. my husband is one bad mother. he is a security guard and also worked as a body guard for some big singers. (lil wayne, too short) he has tatoos, shaved head and can kick some serious ***. but he cried like a baby when we got married, and i think from that moment on, i loved him twice as much. he still to this day gets teary eyed if he has screwed up in our marriage. i think its a good thing.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Not necessarily "encouraged" but not discouraged either - boys and girls should know that tears are a natural response to sadness, sorrow or hurt.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	it would be better if kids were encouraged to express there emotions in a healthy way in general yes, that includes crying.|`|M2yERqNSaa	if they cry for a stupid reason Ill tell them to knock it off<br>  <br>  but if they have a legit reason to cry I let them|`|0YDtjp3Baa	its okay to cry.|`|pghI0etLaa	While I agree that kids should be allowed to cry. I feel that an important part of growing up is learning to control your emotions. So to answer your question kids should be encouraged to cry however they need to realize that there is a time and place for it.
qXq0nmBzaa	It's close to Alex P. Keaton on "Family Ties" from the 80s.<br>  <br>  It's an old Anglo-Irish surname meaning son of a fierce person. It makes sense that your aunt's family used it as a middle name to carry on the family name. They were wise not to make a first name out of it.<br>  <br>  I changed my middle name when I married.

4eTyCuRSaa	When you are financially, emotionally and spiritually stable you should also be mature, educated, and married.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The best time is when you are ready.   You're never going to be ready, after medical school is a specialty, then working on a good position or enough clients and paying down those massive debts (what is it now, $350K?   It was $150-250K when I was looking at med school).   Most women I know try to have their kids during med school when they are the most fertile.|`|DoHaUEziaa	IMHO if you have to ask then it's best to wait. What's the hurry anyhow? It's not like you're going to be old when you finish your studies. You may think so, but trust me you're not.

I would know. I went to this 5 year old boy's funeral. He got caught in the leg stirrup on a saddle when he was getting on, the horse got spooked, and ran like the wind and the child was being smothered by sand, hit by rocks, and his limbs were twisted.

I'm sure the person that died would want people to be at her funeral. It'll be nice that your showing your respects to her. So,it wont be weird. Even some of your friends could go. Even though you didn't know her, her family and friends would apreciate it.|`|0KNR3ohWaa	It may be a little weird but I would go just because you graduated with her and to support her family.

(were not close friends, but my boyfriend is really good friends with him)|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	Since she went to your school, there's nothing wrong with going.|`|3gVPMjURaa	no at all....you go to show your respect to her memorial|`|xsVu6lOEaa	I think its perfectly fine to lend your support and empathy at the funeral for the family. people do this all the time... when famous people die or hig profile deaths occur, people from all over attend their funerals and probably have never met the person face to face until then. death is a universal language... and you going is only saying that you are sorry for their loss.... go to the funeral... the last thing anyone will worry about is who is there and if they really knew the deceased.. they will just appreciate the support.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	that would most likely make some people mad. a similar thing happened to a boy named roy, he died in a car wreck and they did this big thing at our school and they even had a bus that took kids from school to the funeral and a bunch of kids that went didnt know him at all and it pissed off half the school...|`|vMthRkrsaa	Funerals are for the living not for the deceased.  <br>  A show of respect by you attending and giving your condolences would help the family and friends with the tragedy.  <br>  <br>  I vote go.

You will be supporting the family and it will be very good for you to go. Its very nice of you.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	You knew her to some degree.  You want to be there.  You understand the situation. Sounds like a relief to you & potentially great help to those greiving.|`|a397f673797d99b21b2a87fa4d66988baa	I think as long as you are there to pay respects as a fellow student it is not only alright but a good and nice thing to do.|`|eON9Ffhjaa	it depends if other people from your school are going. also if you knew of the person before the death then i think it wud be a good idea to pay your respects|`|DKDkXgfOaa	It might be odd.<br>  But they won't discourage it <br>  Anyone who wants to go is allowed to go and mourn.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	Shut up Cheney. Go shoot your friend again<br>  <br>  Of course it's not weird.You are simply paying your respects.

This could just be me :-) hope you get the answer you want<br>  xoxo|`|AA11832474	Fiona Rose is lovely, but does it just sound nice or does it have some meaning to you.  In some places it will be considered an unusual name.  If that is the case where you live, be prepare to tell your daughter why she has such a special name.|`|AA11313798	im usually picky with names. but i think Fiona Rose is  kinda cool. I normally wouldn't go for that name.. but somehow it looks right together.<br>  <br>  If you like it,go for it.|`|28ux28S0aa	I like the name and everyone that I have known with the names Fiona and Rose have been sweet people. But isn't Fiona the Princess from Shrek? If so, then people might relate her to that.|`|Gh2tGib9aa	I don't really like it the Fiona is a little bland but how about Rose Simmons.|`|AA12114919	Fiona sorry no reminds me of kids show Rose very pretty and dainty|`|5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	I honestly don't like it at all, but definitely go w/ what you like:)|`|8bpR8wjLaa	I kinda like the name neva thot of it be4!!|`|kiW44rY4aa	It sounds really cute:)<br>  great name.|`|i0wWAG1qaa	i like the name hayden for a girl.|`|kk3kv0ePaa	I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
5ZvALiclaa	I've taken my two kids plus a stroller and bags onto the train before and it was quite a task. Its harder getting off than getting on i found though. All i did was ask someone standing on the platform to grab something and help me lift it onto/off the train quickly. Most people are very accomodating if you just ask them. I asked middle aged women as they are always approachable! Some people just offer to help when they can see you have your hands full. <br>  <br>  I would advise though, if you have a baby carrier put baby in it and carry him on you. Then fold up the stroller and sling your bag over your shoulder and you should be right. Ask someone to lift the stroller onto the train for you and any extra bags.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Ij2rM3H4aa	My husband and I decided to go down to London for the weekend with our (then) 5 month old.  We took the tube the first day- not exactly a nightmare, but definitely not easy.  One tip- make sure you get on and off at a handicap-friendly stop, as otherwise you will be lugging the pram up and down those flights of stairs (as we did).  Once we were on (and since it was a Saturday), it was fine, and we had plenty of room.  While it wasn't horrible, we decided to drive everywhere the next day.|`|mE3kLV7faa	Hey :)<br>  <br>  I'm not a london mummy but i do live in london :) <br>  I see lots of women on the tube with their babies and they're pretty competent, but to be honest i see more ladies on the buses because that is a lot easier with the space for the weelchairs/buggies and all. If you saw me i'd be happy to help if you had to lug a buggy off the trains or the bus and i'm sure most others would too :)<br>  Although sometimes there are those boys about my age or middleaged men which really aren't helpful and will just be like 'omg its a baby.. GO DIE' :(|`|TrBoPj92aa	it can be easy but it can be a nightmare<br>  <br>  defiantly don't do between 7-9.30, rush hour 100's of school kids + Business people it gets very packed and you won't get a seat, make sure you know where to go so you don't get lost as well!<br>  <br>  also for coming back make sure you don't leave any later than 3 or if you want to stay in the evening don't leave earlier then 7.30, 3 is the earliest some schools are let out and seriously with a pushchair its SO hard manoeuvring your way through a bunch of 15yr old ignorant boys, its also quite scary! <br>  <br>  Other than that it is quite easy, you need to make sure that at the stations you are travelling the have Access for disabled people, unless you have a very strong man with you it can be very challenging getting a buggy and baby up + down 30 odd stairs<br>  <br>  leave plenty of time for your trip so you aren't stressed out and have fun then baby will also enjoy,<br>  <br>  It also really helps to go for the emptiest carriage, therefore you have as much time as possible to get the buggy on as it can take a while ( i have a double buggy!) and it can be stressful so hopefully with an empty carriage there will be less people getting off . When the train comes be prepared + ready to get the buggy on, i made the mistake of having my bag open and i was texting my fiance telling him where we were therefore i had about 1minute to put my phone in my bag, zip my bag up then lift the double buggy up and get it on, sounds easy but its not!!<br>  <br>  i took my twins to the science museum at around 4months they really enjoyed it and the bubbles also the zoo is a good place we are hoping to go their this summer<br>  <br>  have fun xox|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Use the bus honestly then you know you wont get the door shut on you it is better than just relying on other people or use the baby sling.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I live in Bedfordshire and have only visited London once - when I was very heavily pregnant. <br>  I was disgusted by the number of people who would just turn their heads away when I went on, very obviously pregnant, and they were in those seats specifically for pregnant women, elderly and infirm. I didn't want to argue, so just left it. Once, a woman on the other side of the carriage actually got up for me, despite it being packed - and not one person actually nearer to me even raised their heads.<br>  Sorry I don't have a great deal of info for you, except to say that I hated travelling by tube when I was heavily pregnant, I wouldn't fancy doing it with a baby and buggy too.
UiBslwUPaa	it's hormones that are making you feel guilty. you will have all kinds of mood changes while you are preg.  you shouldn't feel guilty if you are drinking non alcoholic. some dr.s even say that it is ok to drink a small glass of wine from time to time while you are preg. as long as you aren't drinking to get drunk. they say it will help you relax and sleep better|`|plQDCJYCaa	I wouldnt worry about it, non alcoholic drinks are not harmful to you or your child, dont feel guilty.<br>  <br>  If you are living in the UK you could speak to the NHS maybe.<br>  Even if you are in the US or elsewhere look at their website for help.<br>  <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/pregnancycareplanner/Pages/PregnancyHome.aspx?WT.srch=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/pregnancycare...</a>|`|2GjVLKGbaa	Why feel guilty you have done nothing wrong i can remember when i was pregnant both times the only time in my life i have ever wanted to drink beer have been during pregnancy i used to sniff my husbands beer cans to get a whiff to satisfy my craving in the end i had a small very week shandy it was bliss, thats all i needed, good luck x|`|X0ubZnPjaa	dont feel bad, i drank alcohol and smoked during all 3 of my pregnancy's and im pregnant now and still smoke i havent got the will power to stop... as much as im criticised ive never had any problems .. but keep going a non alcoholic drink isn't gonna do any harm..|`|lSiv5PDlaa	ASK THE OB IT SHOULD BE SAFE AND NONALCOHOLIC SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO, ALSO WINE IN MODERATION IS SAFE, I WOULDNT TRY I THOUGH UNLESS YOU DECIDE TO SPEAK THE OB ON THE SUBJECT ABOUT LIMITS<br>  BUT ANYTHING ELSE IS A NO|`|vygYFdsSaa	You shouldn't feel guilty for having a non-alcoholic beer.

I would be cautious and talk to your Dr to find out if its ok to drink non alcoholic beer.  I know all Drs are different.  I had one telling me a glass of red wine with dinner was ok where my midwife says no way not a drop.  <br>  I did drink before I found out I was pregnant and I didn't find out til 12 weeks (long story).  I am worried still even with all the reassurance in the world its normal as a mother to be concerned.  Best Wishes and congrats!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i don't understand how people really enjoy non alcoholic beer...i would love a non alcoholic margarita :)<br>  <br>  you shouldn't feel guilty...but i guess i can understand why.<br>  <br>  the only time you should really feel guilty is when you decide to drink alcohol.<br>  <br>  in my book what to expect when you're expecting, it says that when the mother is drinking and feeling "buzzed" the baby is just then starting to pass out...while the mother is still buzzing and waiting for the next drink :(|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	Don't worry, a non alcoholic beer will do no harm to your baby.<br>  <br>  If you feel guilty just don't do it again, the morning I found out I was pregnant I sat having a cigarette as I waited for my result. I sat and cried when I got my positive out of guilt - I have not had one cigarette since & I feel so proud.

I went to a psychologist for two years because my high school made me becuase they knew i was anorexic and they thought that I cut.  Well, I had to go, and there was no way to deny I was anorexic since all my bones showed and I had to also go to a nutricionist. But I never told her, or admited to anyone that I cut.  I also never told her that I was raped, didnt tell anyone about that.<br>  I understand that its really hard to say some things outloud.  When I finally told people, they were people I trusted, my friends.  Once I told them and was finally able to talk about it with someone, it made it a lot easier to talk about in general.<br>  So I suggest talking to your friends about it, or someone your really trust if you cant tell the other counsler.<br>  Good luck!
p2Njf5gBaa	I only use diaper cream when my sons bum is irritated or looks like its developing a rash.  Whenever it looks a little red I use some, but not all the time. <br>  I think the A + D ointment works the best.  <br>  <br>  I don't use baby powder on my son, its not good if it were to get into their lungs.  Their is liquid baby powder that is better to use.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't throw it away.  On a morning you don't get a chance to take a shower and your hair looks slightly greasy, you can use a little baby powder on your hair, brush it through, and it instantly takes away the greasy look.  Also baby powder can be used to absorb mositure in shoes,  say your husband has a stinky pair yard shoes sitting around, put a squirt or two in their to eliminate odors.  <br>  <br>  If you have more then you would ever go through, just donate it to some place such as a womans shelter, some food pantry take items like that, or the salvation army.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I put on a little vaseline on after his bath, but besides that I don't use anything.  Unless a diaper rash appears, which it has not.<br>  <br>  People gave me a lot of powder too.  It is occasionally useful if they get a little redness in one of their neck folds.  But at this rate, he'll be in college before I use what I have.|`|xue72D76aa	You could also donate the baby power to your local Salvation Army.  People use it for other reasons aside from powdering baby butts.<br>  <br>  I only use diaper cream if there is any redness.  I use Balmex.  I used to use Desitin until my daughter was hospitalized with a stomach virus.  She had diarrhea from the virus and got a little red.  They put Balmex on one time and by the next diaper change her butt was completely redness free.  I was so astounded I immediately switched to Balmex.<br>  <br>  EDIT - You can prevent rashes by allowing their butts to dry after using wipes before re-diapering.  A little diaper-free time a day also helps.  Good luck!|`|sMukgX7Xaa	I use either johnson and johnson diaper rash ointment or the butt patse. I don't use powder b/c I was told it can actually break down the skin if used too often. The only time I use the powder is when my little girl has a yeast infection. It helps dry it out. I mix a little of the butt paste with nyastatin and sprinkle a little powder in it to make it a thick paste. I don't mix it around the baby so she don't inhale it. I used it on my son as well and it works well.<br>  <br>  If he/she has sensitive skin like my daughter does you can use a regular ointment like johnson and johnson or destin every change.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I don't use powder, I gave mine to people who chose to use it...and there is no need for ointment unless there is a rash so I don't use that either but if he does get red i use Denstin cream til it is gone :)|`|ibWLdXlJaa	My son has only really had one rash worth mentioning but I used Butt Paste and I always keep it handy if he starts to get a little red.

I do use powder on my son, usually only after he poops or after a bath... I don't think powder is bad, my son never has any problems from it.... When he does get a rash though, I use Desitin. I've tried Butt Paste but it didn't work half as well as Desitin.|`|WGXdfh22aa	i only use desitin when either of my kids start to get a little red. i have found that if you put it on at the first signs that a diaper rash could develop then one never does. but thats the only time i put it on. you dont need to put it on all the time only when its needed.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	Powder is better for boys than girls. It can break a baby girl out. The reason they say not to use powder is because if it's inhaled, it can be harmful. Just keep it away from your baby's face if you decide to use it. I don't use cream unless my daughter has a rash. Seems a little pointless. If you do use cream, I would use Boudreaux's Butt Paste. It's the best!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i may put a little vaseline on his butt sometimes. i only use diaper rash creme if he is a little red and baby powder after a really bad stinky. i wouldnt use it on a girl.

jHDeIPEfaa	I love the name David but don't like Urijah.|`|bIaywrBCaa	It's pretty good. I love biblical names, not too fond of Urijah.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Beautiful name!<br>  <br>  We also named our children biblical names because we're practicing Roman Catholics and biblical names means the most and they names have been around for ages!<br>  <br>  Our 2 teens:<br>  Sarah<br>  Aaron|`|gPuASwcWaa	Horrible name, how about an american name like jesus,or andrew, that name is horrible eww!|`|pm0O9Twhaa	well i like the david|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Ugh how to u even pronounce the 1st name,<br>  I do not not like it sorry|`|myEwHgI1aa	It is unique...I think I like it :)<br>  <br>  edit: I agree with you...names do have a meaning and personally I want to name my children something that means something good! No matter what name you pick, there will be nay sayers, so go with the one you know is right for him.|`|758cDKEFaa	persoanlly its not my sort of name, only cos i prefer simple and to the point names but if you like it what anyone else thinks shouldnt really matter.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I'd prefer a biblical name like Noah or Elijah.|`|HjA3x8dWaa	i would NOT like to be that poor kid.|`|bvjvV8k9aa	DON'T DO IT TRY ELIJAH|`|P6KPjt1naa	i love it. =) i have a cousin w/ that middle name.|`|tmF5vpR7aa	is you from some kinda nunnery or somedinnnnn?|`|TYGgRjqDaa	It sounds like a female body part|`|NLy5f4uhaa	If that is what your like then that is the perfect name!!!!!!! Does it have a spacial meaning? If it does then dont think twice about naming him that but if you think that you might want a different name then use it as his middle name but if thats what you want then its perfect!!!! It will be unique!!!!!|`|AA10152966	Honey, it's your child so who is anyone else to judge your decision? I personally do not care for it, but that's why YOU are the parent NOT anyone else! It is different though and that is what a lot of parents want.|`|BHkaULukaa	It's a cool biblical name, but he would end up having to correct people constantly on the pronunciation and that might end up making him dislike the name.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Looks like it would be pronounced (your-i-juh) like Elijah.   I like biblical names but I prefer Elijah, Aaron, Gabriel, Isaiah or Noah.|`|d1a57165e69fb7e3ade74a8659b315cdaa	I like the second name. I would not recommend "biblical" names as many people will have troubles with it.|`|sCBR7Acyaa	hmm its kinda hard to say...how about Mattew Mark Luke John or peter.  or maybe David or Joel? i think Luke and Joel are really cute (:|`|p106IBuNaa	i think that its a great name. VERY unique. love it.|`|rkeLJ8RAaa	personally i dont really like the first name.. its kinda bizarre <br>  <br>  NO OFFENSE!!!|`|47M20WOUaa	Well if you like the names you choose then that's all that should matter :)|`|uKJUKs8Naa	Its...<br>  Cute<br>  Adorable<br>  Nice<br>  Holy<br>  <br>  I like it<br>  ?|`|J2G6ebThaa	I LOVE THAT NAME! its so unique!|`|d573b9bde3a327e77424db30de81f60aaa	What does it mean?|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	gay|`|ZTRakv6maa	not so much
oGHtaaCkaa	I got used to it a long time ago. <br>  Really, just learn to deal and suck it up.<br>  We're always going to be surrounded by stereotypes...racial, age group-wise , whatever...<br>  <br>  In general though people just need to learn not to judge people on what they see, but what they know.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	I TOTALLY AGREE,<br>  but the thing is...you typically only hear about the bad in people.<br>  their is a vast group of teens who smoke pot or are irresponsible and pregnant, and  the one's of us who are actually trying to make a good name/life for ourselves aren't always what people try to see.<br>  <br>  fact is, people always try to find the worst in people. & people always will be judgmental|`|X1NVjZEKaa	I agree! <br>  You are brilliant!|`|jTaW3goeaa	I don't know, I have the same question though.  Its just like the stereotype that all snowboarders are punk kids.  Well thats not always true|`|M3xTT1bUaa	I agree. But society is the way it is. There is stereotypes for everything, every race, and age, and clothes you were. Basically society needs a way to "understand" people, so they find common things in people who look alike- there lies the stereotype.<br>  <br>  I love the one were most people who dress less conservatively smoke weed. I've found that more rich preppies smoke weed than what older people would expect. They have money to buy it, so they do. (I went to a private school so I've seen it.)|`|lzKt3RtOaa	There's old people stereotypes too. I know what you mean though. I used to be a teen and now that I'm older I can kinda understand it. Like if you go to a store or restaurant and you are used to getting quick service with no mistakes it's usually by someone who has experience. Many time teens are working their first jobs and don't know as much and don't always know how to handle certain situations. I try to be understanding about that, but some people can't and so they lose it. It's the same with the elderly so don't feel bad. I'm in between and there are other kinds of stereotypes to overcome also.|`|438be6a17f9eda0e2f3d35a0b4b69268aa	yes i do agree...they think that all teens are the same..like in my family i think that most of them especially one of my aunts treat me differently just because i am a teen. and then im graduating early so there like "ur still a kid, wait a while" and so on, so yea i agree with you, so much more i could say......(i know, typo;s) =D|`|sY1SjHeJaa	Yes, I do.<br>  Whenever I go into a store, I'm not treated with the same respect a middle-aged woman is treated with. It's frustrating.|`|yn72mHCcaa	teenagers act out and have attitude cause of their hormones|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	I do!|`|8DhmRwMraa	RITE!!!! NOT ALL TEENS R BADD!!!!|`|iCKkOWI7aa	they are not|`|ixmaM395aa	I agree, but I think it's everyone that is stereotyped, not just teens. <br>  <br>  There are many stereotypes which linger around people of all age, race, religion & gender. And unfortunately, they're something we can never escape. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't fit a typical stereotype you'll still be labeled an "outcast" or something along those lines. <br>  <br>  I think it's sad we categorize people. With so many billions & squillions of people in the world we can't all be complete individuals, so of course we're going to fall into a mould of some description. But that is not to say we don't have our own personality that breaks through the stereotype!|`|m2WGmGXjaa	Idk I think it's because a lot of teenagers crave to fit into somewhere, and in turn they have a tendency to place others in a certain stereotype.<br>  <br>  Personally I couldn't care less (I'm fifteen) whether or not I fit a certain stereotype, or whether someone else does. I mean we're all different and in my eyes that's what makes us amazing! Giving that up, and giving up who you are to fit into a stereotype is just stupid to me!<br>  Why on earth would you wanna be someone your not?|`|NQoyNWaUaa	Its because those are the ones that get all the attention so all of you are affected, the media should also focus on young adults that are trying to make a difference in there lives and community.|`|vWuEu1pnaa	Its usualy the parents....They make things seem bad like the whole racist against blacks and other races.<br>  It usualy is the parents fault not all the time just usualy....|`|788d7c7ce9ee2dd89f47d95303ca9817aa	Teens aren't the worst stereotyped.|`|A1pEScw8aa	I agree. I am a teenager and I am sterotyped all the time even though I am a good student and don't do bad stuff. lol screw people|`|vrX6Gvj6aa	totally i do.<br>  <br>  haha we should all just start discriminating against middle aged adults with their mid-life crises. :)|`|tnQGOsaeaa	Not really...<br>  Ever since these shows and movies about pregnant 16 yr Olds..lol<br>  Ive never even heard of half of those stereotypes lol|`|99fwqOPBaa	Not really... it's just that when a teenager is pregnant, then they are pretty irresponsible. Unless they want the kid...|`|oASdqh2Jaa	blah<br>  im a teenager and i dont even care this much a bout sterotypes.<br>  probably because i dont belong ot any of them|`|lsFveRfFaa	I AGREE!!!|`|KI9htZjJaa	It's Life, get used to it.|`|7iyOVkuUaa	its just cause people think were dumb<br>  but who cares|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Yes, I agree.<br>  <br>  Not all teenagers are irresponsible and the ones that are could be for many reasons, but often poor parenting is a big contributory factor.|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Probably because you hear more about the bad kind of kids. 30 plus years ago you were a bad boy if you had long hair and a bad girl if you wore "hip huggers." I was actually sent home from school in the 70s for doing it. I don't believe all teens are bad kids. There are probably more good ones. And I don't think you are the most stereotyped group. I think the elderly own that one.
28ux28S0aa	There are times during the labor and delivery where things get pretty tough. Here is a list of things that helped me that may help you:<br>  <br>  -make sure that you have a birth coach or partner or doula that will be there with you at all times. Before the birth this person and you should spend a few times a    week working on relaxation exercises together so that when the time comes your brain and body is trained to relax from certain triggers (like words or massage or whatever works for you). Also make sure that you feel completely comfortable with this person because they will be there for everything. They should also know that when you are in labor that what you will want will change from moment to moment and for them to go with that and not get frustrated. One minute you might want to be massaged and the next moment not want to be touched.<br>  <br>  -Visualize the labor and birth and after birth- every part of it- and when visualizing it if there is a part that causes you to tense up work on making peace with that in your mind before you get there in real life. I found that I always tensed up when imagining breast feeding after the birth. I worked through it and that released a lot of anxiety and then when I got to that point it went beautifully.<br>  <br>  -Get to know your baby as much as possible before the birth by rubbing your belly or singing to the baby or talking to it... you'll be amazed how much your love for that baby will grow just by doing that. Then when you are at difficult parts of the labor just think about why you are feeling that way and then it is much easier to handle it. You are feeling those things because it is part of the process to get that baby in your arms.<br>  <br>  -try your hardest not to tense up. When you feel a contraction instead of focusing on the painful sensation instead remind yourself that with each contraction the baby is moving closer and closer to it's beautiful entry into the world. You can even visualize that during a contraction to keep you focused on the task at hand.<br>  <br>  -Know that you can make a birth plan, but also don't get upset if your plan has to change. All births are different and most of them end with a healthy mom and baby.<br>  <br>  -Good luck, enjoy, there is nothing like looking into a baby's eyes after you both worked so hard to get in each other's arms. The human body and that baby inside you are amazing. They know exactly how to get that baby out, so relax as much as possible (with your birthing partner) and let them do their job without you tensing up and causing stress on what your body and your baby are doing. Be an observer in a way.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Childbirth is such an amazing miracle to me. Be confident!|`|6ErVPePEaa	I never had a panic attack, and I have a  anxiety disorder. Epidurals help A LOT.. I have had 2 kids and never felt 1 real contraction.. I had no pain just a lot of pressure|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I did - during my contractions I panicked and couldn't breathe though the pain. They were fantastic though, they calmed me down, went through my breathing & gave me more pain relief.<br>  Please don't worry hun - you won't be the first nor will you be the last mummy who panics, they'll know how to help :)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I know I will, when im in a lot of pain every other word that comes out of my mouth is F*** so i dont think the doctors will be very happy with me but i doubt i will care<br>  <br>  I am scared $hitle$$ to give birth|`|t0mb150gaa	I was in labor for 16 and a half hours and could not take the epidural due to an allergy so yes the pain got to me and i "flipped out" i was begging for a c-section and cussing a lot but the nurses and doctors and my family was very understanding and supportive. Just don't worry and know that you will make it through no matter how much pain there is and in the end it is all well worth it.|`|d94d376d37270864191dbd4310431caaaa	My friend did during her labor (I was with her as the coach).  She was prone to anxiety attacks.  At one point she closed her legs and said "I'm not doing this anymore!!".  I was just calm and told her she didn't have a choice and she was going to be a new mom soon.  I was supportive and gave her what she needed.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	All i can say is get the epidural!! I ended up having an emergency c-section after 28 1/2 hours but once i started feeling pain when i was about 5cm i got the epi and was in heaven 2min later, after that i didnt feel any pain what so ever.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	everyone! lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babynames.com/namelist/9665405" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynames.com/namelist/966540...</a>|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I'm sure you will be okay. I didn't have a panic attack, but with my first baby I got really angry lol. I went through the whole labor and delivery without any pain medication and no epidural and it was definitely painful, but I was also induced and the pitocin tends to make the contractions stronger. I literally screamed at the top of my lungs and cussed at everyone and threw everything I could get ahold of. I was much calmer the second time around lol. The doctors and nurses are trained for every situation and they know how to handle it when women get hysterical or panicky.|`|fHgbL046aa	I can't believe this question. That was me 16 years ago when I was having my first child. I kept praying I wouldn't have a panic attack. I didn't and I had a crappy delivery. You should tell your self your in the hospital and its the best place to be if your gonna have a panic attack. There are things like the epidural and laughing gas to help with the pain.<br>  I am 19 weeks and 6 days pregnant with my second and I take medication because I have panic attacks and anxiety. I am hoping to have a better delivery and no panic attacks. I'm pretty confident everything will be great, and knowing myself like I do that is pretty amazing I feel like that. You will be fine because you won't have time to panic or freak out cause you will be having a baby.<br>  Good luck I  hope all goes well for you.|`|WPI0Z47saa	My friend did really bad and they ended up performing an emergency c-section and tieing her arms down. But she was really out of control and flaring around all over the place. They though she was a risk to the baby. It will be fine, they will get the baby out safely somehow. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit: Why would I get a thumbs down for sharing an experience. I didn't say it would happen to her. I am just sharing a story.|`|qM1qoDhCaa	I didn't. But I wouldn't worry about it. If the worst happens and you do completely flip-out, they can give you enough medication to knock you out and when you wake up the baby will be out.  In fact that was routinely how women gave birth in the 1950s.  It isn't ideal of course, but the option is there if you need it.<br>  <br>  I would go ahead and talk to your docotor about this being possible now.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i flipped, seriously after ten hours of hard labour and being dialated at only five i was ready to go in there and pull the baby out myself.......enter gas and air and all was good again lol|`|MqFeJiukaa	With my first I lost total control.  I feel it made it so much worse.  I had no clue what I was getting into.  My best advice is to educate yourself.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I did. They give you drugs for the pain. You'll be fine. Its scary but so worth it.|`|4szKHHtJaa	There is a time in almost every woman's labor where she thinks (and vocalizes) that she cannot go on. Many times shaking and vomiting also accompany this stage. It's called transition and it usually happens when your cervix is dilating the last few centimeters. It is also the shortest stage of labor lasting around a half hour to hour on average. Active stage is usually noted not only when your cervix dilates to around 5-7 cm but also you get more serious and the contractions require your full attention to deal with them. This can be a critical time in a woman's labor because you either decide to surrender to the amazing forces getting your baby out to you and into your arms or you can fight it with your mind and tense with your body and work against getting your baby out. childbirth classes can help a lot in giving you needed tools and information to help you birth (bradley, lamaze, icea, etc.). Also, having a birth doula can help to help encourage you and give you techniques to handle the pain (studies have shown up to 60% reduction in epidural rates with the use of a doula--that is, having that support can help women cope). Also, know what your provider's policies are about coping with pain: what do they encourage? Do they allow movement and showers/baths? These can help greatly in aiding a women's ability to cope. If you are strapped down in bed, it is a lot harder to cope with the contractions. If needs be, discuss the use of analgesiacs (demerol, etc.) and anesthetics (like an epidural). Be aware of the pros and cons of these. They may aid you greatly if you are truly fighting your body's attempts at giving birth, but also be aware that they may not take away all sensations so explore you options. Good luck!
Tk2H2BAfaa	First I want to say one thing, always have him wear a condom.  Why do it one time and not the other.  If you are going to be grown up enough to have sex then be responsible to always wear protection.  Having sex is serious business and if you are not ready to have a baby then ALWAYS have your partner wear a condom.<br>  <br>  Now I am no expert but it possible that you didn't get your period like you normally do.  Some times your body will skip it.  Since you are young things could be a bit off until you get older.  However, you could be pregnant as well.  The time of month you had sex is the perfect time to get pregnant.  You could always buy a test at the store.  If your sneaky enough to have sex your sneaky enough to buy a test.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Well if your worried then you need a test. If you can't tell your mom right now then you should walk to the store and buy one..you can get it from walmart, oscoe, wallgreens anywhere like that and you don't have to be a certain age to buy it you can be any age...you can get one for 10 dollars...heck you can even go to the dollar store and get one! <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! No one can say yes or no to you..only your HCG can tell!|`|UgX3gUSJaa	Just like Richard G said, if u are sneaky enough to have sex, ur sneaky enough to buy a test|`|BhYDTUrWaa	well if you are still in school sex should be the last thing on your mind<br>  but if it is some thing you do it would be better to use a condom every time because you never know what the other person got and they pass it right along to you and if you use a condom you would never have to ask yourself if you are pregnant you might not be it might just be late don't worry|`|WljG2gXsaa	sounds to me like your prego. you should take a first response test theyre the best. try telling someone you could trust and see if they could take you to get one. at walmart the first response is $8
jgtfWjE4aa	not everyone goes through the throwing up thing haha<br>  if you're lucky, you wont!<br>  <br>  i'm just now starting to actually feel pregnant at 16 weeks 3 days.<br>  <br>  once you hear the heartbeat and see that there really is a baby inside of you it definitely gets more real! and very exciting<br>  <br>  now that i'm starting to show and i'm feeling a little bit of movement i feel like i'm bonding more with my baby.<br>  <br>  it's an exciting journey.<br>  congrats :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not every woman gets symptoms and even when you get symptoms that doesn't mean you will get them all. It's usually a select few. If you are 7 weeks and not feeling any symptoms you are unlikely to really get any bad ones. If you read the early pregnancy symptoms lists they even say not everyone gets them. Count yourself lucky.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Nope not every woman gets all the symptoms.<br>  Im 31 weeks pregnant and have thrown up once this whole pregnancy (I had the flu yikes) I didn't get any symptoms except I could sleep so much more and still feel tired!<br>  My boobs got bigger but were never sore and I've been able to work fine up until now.<br>  Honestly ididnt start to "feel pregnant" until I was about 23 weeks pregnant and could feel the baby kicking me.<br>  Before that I didn't feel any different and part of me was in denial that I was pregnant.<br>  But feeling the baby move is a good reminder and your time will come.<br>  Hopefully you have a smooth pregnancy like I did.<br>  Good luck =D|`|qitXGd0qaa	Well, you might be one of the lucky ones that never deal with morning sickness and other common complaints of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I thought I was one of the lucky ones too. However, my morning sickness kicked in around 13 weeks. I was sick the remainder of the pregnancy. I was sick at all hours, after most meals and even in the hospital for being dehydrating (from vomitting) twice, once just a week before my daughter was born.|`|0844781bb7790202c3eef84c190b3e2daa	Not every woman will get morning sickness, I was lucky and was only sick a coulple of times, your still really early in the pregnancy, but you might start to get really hungry soon I did, and got tired easily early in my pregnancy. Once you get to around 18 weeks you will start to fell movement which is great bit strange at first! Good luck and just enjoy it I loved being Pregnant. xxxxxx|`|TSxbN0Asaa	Not all pregnancies are the same. With my first pregnancy I was extremely sick and could barley get out of bed. I couldn't hold anything down and had to get put on medication for it. With this pregnancy I haven't thrown up at all so far. My body is very sore but that is about it.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Not everyone goes threw morning sickness (I didn't). As for feeling pregnant-it depends on your body. I started feeling pregnant around 5 months. Good luck in your pregnancy.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Not everyone goes through pregnancy the same. Consider this a good thing! Some women get all the symtoms, some women none at all. Good luck to you|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	most ppl throw up <br>  i think in 3rd month|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	With my first I had no symptoms at all-I didn't feel pregnant properly until I started to get a bump and my baby started moving, which was at about 4 and a half months. Not everyone throws up, then others will throw up way more than is classed as 'normal'. Every pregnancy is different!<br>  <br>  Oh and congratulations!|`|96HWpdkFaa	Every pregnancy is different and every women is different. I didn't have throwing up till 7 weeks and then it turned into more just nausea and right now I'm 8 weeks and 1 day and all I feel really is nausea, sore breasts and sometimes slight cramping (normal in early pregnancy when not with blood) So don't worry! Your fine...many women have no morning sickness at all. And some women who have been pregnant more then once notice that one pregnancy is worse then the other! It's just your hormones are different each time and no ones are the same. Your fine don't worry! and congrats and good luck!
5ZvALiclaa	get a memory stick/flash drive and save them all onto it. Then you can copy all your pictures onto it for safe keeping but keep them on your computer too. If anything happens to the computer you will have a copy of all the pics on the memory stick. Or you could use a re-writable CD or if its home videos, a Re-writable DVD|`|AA10912192	We are in the process of converting our home videos to DVD and putting them in our Safety Deposit Box at the bank if you have one of those you could do that. We have to many pictures to do that with but the Videos are very important to my family also! Good Luck it takes a while!|`|xyrSl2nSaa	you could try putting them on photobucket.com... just make sure you make your albums private so no one else can see them<br>  <br>  if you dont want to do that then you could try putting them on a thumb drive or a cd|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'd say a memory stick.  I have my son's saved on two computers (mine and mother's) and also plan on getting a usb stick and doing more hard copies of them.|`|cTsb7vFjaa	Yes, you should burn 2 copies to CD.  Keep a copy for yourself in the house, and then give the other one to a trusted family member or friend for safe keeping.
SJx9IWWtaa	I only get annoyed when I'm really busy, or when she asks me a question and then tells me I'm wrong. (Thats her new habit)<br>  <br>  She'll ask something like "Whats daddys favorite color".  When I tell her its green, she'll say "No its not".  Then I get annoyed, and have to remind myself she's 6 and don't let yourself get dragged down to her level lol|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well it can be a bit annoying especially when we are not as patient as we should be.  BUT honestly I think they say "WHY" over & over mostly because it's one of the few words they know so they like to say it repeatedly.<br>  <br>  So try and realize that and find an alternative to annoyance and try teaching a NEW WORD that they can add to their vocabulary and, give them a more CREATIVE Answer to their many "WHYS" - something active, bright, interesting, muscial, vocal or visually stimulating which might be more distracting to their WHYS and be more of a satisfactory ANSWER as well.<br>  <br>  BUT your feelings of annoyance and impatience certainly happen to many of us as parents - but when they are little try and redirect it because face it - they are just being LITTLE INNOCENT sweet kids and think you are so big, perfect and their whole WORLD!|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Only when they ask for money|`|iMULlxdgaa	lol...yeah actually a friend and me were talking about this exact thing.  its normal, especially when they keep asking the same question over and over...my son does this and he's 4, like he thinks I'll give him a different response, he doesn't do it as much any more but now its just every once in awhile.  Actually now he hardly does it at all but I remember this behavior a few months ago.  With a 1 year old its probably that they just get stuck on one word but don't really know what it means yet..they are testing it out.|`|VS8mactUaa	I used to do that when I was a child, turns out I got O.C.D haha so I still got questions lol.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Yes! Today my 2 year old was asking about why the sky was blue! He said "why is the sky blue?" He said Why! Why!!!! Why!!!!!! It can get very annoying.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Duck tape.............works wonders lol|`|xyrSl2nSaa	i watch children in my home and right now i have a 5 year and a 2year old... well the 5 year old asks me questions all day long! it drives me absolutely insane! He will ask me off the wall questions that i really don't know the answer to and when i say "i dont know" he says "yes you do" so what i do is when i can't take it anymore i tell him if he asks me another question he is going to bed, it works|`|qayCggxMaa	After about the 20th "why?" in a row I do start getting annoyed.  Depending on what I'm doing I'll try to turn it around and ask "Why do you think?" or I'll just say "Mommy is busy right now and can't answer that."  I've tried saying "I don't know." before, but most of the time her answer to that is "Yes you do."  then she'll ask they "why" question again.  It can get pretty exasperating.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	No. it makes me happy that she is so inquisitive.  I hear why so many times a day that it'd be impossible to keep count.  Eventually I have to answer with either, "I don't know", or "Because God made it that way".  Find joy in it instead of grief.  Be happy your child is intelligent.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	It's natural to get annoyed. My 5 year old asks me lots of questions all day long. We tell her the answer and move on. I asked her once why she asks so many questions. She told me "that's how God made me". But how else are they going to learn unless they ask questions??|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Nope, not unless it's just being sassy. But if it's genuine curiosity, not at all. I try my best to answer, and if I don't know, we'll look it up together.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	No, I actually love answering their questions!  I want to them to be curious and interested in things their entire lives - because that's how you learn and get smart!|`|B9KwqnuDaa	No I'm glad he wants to learn about everything.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	NO!!!! I have a child who's developmentally delayed, deal with that and you'd be glad that your child can ask those questions.  Every time they ask a question  and it upsets you ask your self how you would feel if they weren't able to ask those questions?????What if they didn't have the cognitive ability or if they weren't able to talk, or if they weren't able to hear and there fore couldn't speak clearly.  Thank God that your child can ask questions and realize that the more questions they ask the smarter they will be and the more able to do well in school.  I know I have three children with Learning disabilities and one of them is developmentally delayed and didn't ask a lot of questions until well past the age of other children.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	There are genuine questions about intriguing things and questions that are used to focus your attention on the child. What does your child need when they ask the question? Understanding about something or your attention? Try to read their body language and focus and you'll see that sometimes they want your presence, or just to not be alone. <br>  <br>  Asking questions repeatedly could be a sign of attention deficit. Meaning a deficit of the parent's attention towards the child, not ADD. Children thrive on being seen, heard with joy and appreciation.<br>  <br>  Apart from that, questions are wonderful possibilities to research and discover together, creating life-long habits of learning.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My sister used to do it just to annoy - she would pick random stuff and say, 'why is mummy?'<br>  Why is mummy what??<br>  Nothing, just 'why is mummy?'<br>  Arrrrgggghhhh.<br>  My 3 year old really annoys me by saying 'huh?' all the time - I keep trying to correct her, but she ignores me.|`|UiBslwUPaa	yes, my 4y/o asks like 1,000 questions a day. it's always why? or what are you doing? it can be annoying at times but i know i was the same way when i was her age. i would hate to be her teacher though having 20 4y/o ask you why 100 times in 3 hours.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i sometimes get a little frustrated. my 8 year old can beat a record, i know it. but, then i just think about how blessed i am to have kids to be frustrated about. this too, shall pass :0)|`|JivuAmfiaa	Oh yes! They ask you a random question whilst you are busy making food, doing the washing up, etc. and when you give them the answer all you hear is "Why? Why? Why?". It gets so annoying!|`|731jNq3uaa	Yes, I get annoyed.<br>  <br>  Just keep answering them, because that is how they learn.<br>  <br>  This will continue till they are at least 3.|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	I read somewhere or heard somewhere that an average 2 yr old asks over 400 questions a day! I think it's natural to be annoyed, just try not to show it.|`|4iXL4C6paa	Well my two year old has this thing where she like everything for example<br>  <br>  "mommy I like your shoes"<br>  'mommy I like your leg"<br>  "mommy I like your floor"<br>  <br>  I mean seriously it never ends lol|`|ZTRakv6maa	omg, i dont miss that age at all!  yeah..totally annoying! that doesnt mean you dont love your kid...just means your human. i think allll the time, "stfu" when they dont quit yappin.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	hahah i used to ask why all the time<br>  now that i am older i understand how it gets to be annoying|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	no, never. And if I can't explain something we research it.|`|93eppE5Gaa	When my very inquisitive children (takes after their mom ;D) were small, I did not mind, although it can wear you down.<br>  <br>  I used distraction and diversion pretty much all the time.<br>  <br>  I could handle maybe 7 or so repetitions or individual questions at a time. But at some point (before I became truly aggravated), I would turn their attention to something else: a toy, or program/movie, a book to read or color, a song, or something else. I'd tickle them, play tag, offer a snack, something...<br>  <br>  And, amazingly enough, after a short period of an alternate activity, I would check to see if they wanted to ask me anything, else, and would discover I had had a little break and was up for the 7 or so questions, and a few extras. More often than not, they would be involved in their new activity and the questions were deferred...for a time.<br>  <br>  Now I am grandmother to five wonderful grandchildren, several are in that ask, ask, ask stage, and the baby will be there soon.<br>  <br>  Patience, however is always key. Some little ones may not want to be distracted immediately, but when you suggest a favorite acitivty or plaything, it usually does the trick.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little one!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  God bless you.<br>  ? ?
5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	Put it in the refrigerator.. don't keep it past 24 hrs.<br>  <br>  EDIT: lol @ the thumbs down.. my "baby" is now 3 years old so perhaps I don't remember correctly.. but I thought it was safe to refrigerate leftovers...??|`|pXSKSS3daa	You can't. Once your baby has drank out of a bottle then that remaining formula is only good for the next hour.<br>  <br>  If he only drinks 2 oz. at a time then only make 2 oz. It's easier to add to that rather than waste it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Responsible formula feeding means pouring half empty bottles down the sink.  It is just a reality of feeding this way.<br>  <br>  This stops happening as much as they get older.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You can't save it - once the baby has had the nipple in his mouth, you can't save the formula that is left - it may have bacteria from the baby's mouth in it.<br>  <br>  It is not worth risking gastroenteritis for 2 oz of formula!|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	If they're consistently only drinking 2 oz, then make the whole 4oz bottle, then put half in another bottle. if he ends up wanting the other two ounces it's no big deal to just give it to him. <br>  <br>  I had that problem too in the beginning. It's frustrating. It won't be long before 4 oz isn't enough. lol|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Dont save it please...the saliva mixed in causes harmful bacteria to grow...if you dont like wasting it then I suggest making only 2 oz each time and then make more if he is still hungry...good luck :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can prepare 4 oz, but only put two in the bottle.  Then if she wants more put another 1 oz in, and then another 1oz.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/pif_guidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publicatio...</a><br>  9. Discard any feed that has not been consumed within two hours.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness and death in infants due to infections<br>  with Enterobacter sakazakii. During production, PIF can become contaminated with harmful bacteria, such as<br>  Enterobacter sakazakii and Salmonella enterica. This is because, using current manufacturing technology, it is<br>  not feasible to produce sterile PIF. During the preparation of PIF, inappropriate handling practices can exacerbate<br>  the problem.<br>  Recognizing the need to address such hazards in PIF, Codex Alimentarius decided to revise the Recommended<br>  International Code of Hygienic Practice for Foods for Infants and Children. In doing so it requested specific<br>  scientific advice from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health<br>  Organization (WHO). FAO and WHO have provided this advice in the reports of two expert meetings held in<br>  2004 and 2006 on Enterobacter sakazakii and other microorganisms in powdered infant formula (PIF). Part of<br>  this advice included recommendation to develop guidelines for the preparation of PIF.<br>  The World Health Assembly (WHA) of WHO requested in 2005 the Organization to develop such guidelines on<br>  the safe preparation, handling and storage of PIF in order to minimize the risk to infants.<br>  The FAO/WHO advice on E. sakazakii in PIF includes a quantitative microbiological risk assessment of E. sakazakii<br>  in PIF. One of the aspects of the risk assessment was to determine relative risk reduction associated with<br>  different preparation, storage and handling scenarios. The recommendations made in the present guideline<br>  document are largely based on the findings of the quantitative risk assessment. No risk assessment was carried<br>  out for Salmonella, but the group reported that the basic risk control principles for E. sakazakii would also hold<br>  true for S. enterica.<br>  In general, sterile liquid infant formula is recommended for infants at the highest risk of infection. Where sterile<br>  liquid infant formula is not available, preparation of PIF with water at a temperature of no less than 70 °C<br>  dramatically reduces the risk. Minimizing the time from preparation to consumption also reduces the risk, as<br>  does storage of prepared feed at temperatures no higher than 5 °C.<br>  Users of PIF are made aware that powdered infant formula is not a sterile product and may be contaminated<br>  with pathogens that can cause serious illness. Correct preparation and handling of PIF reduces the risk of illness|`|hFoYmSgqaa	check the amount of formula for weight and make accordingly. for example my baby is 13lbs 8oz and has 5 six ounce bottles, he is on extra hungry aptamil formula. always empty milk out after one hour as it goes off after that even if you make it fresh. i sometimes have to throw out three ounces and then make up another three ounce bottle later for him to make up what he didn't take.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	welll u arent supposed to save it but if my son drinks 2 oz out of a 8oz bottle im saving it in the fridge. i rinse the nipple again bf he drinks out of it again or i take the top off completely. seriously how many germs can a 5month old really have lol|`|rlDDTtAoaa	When my son was a baby, I would fix an entire days worth of formula in a container, then feed what he needed when he needed. I stored it in the fridge and made fresch each day. Which guidelines say 24 hour storage is fine.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	No. They recommend throwing it out after your baby drinks out of that container. The bacteria grows easier that way. Maybe you can try a smaller amt and if he still seems hungry, make another ounce or 2.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	you can't. it will go bad and could make your baby sick. try making 2 ounces at a time. if he wants more, make 2 more.|`|4iXL4C6paa	just make him smaller amounts if he is still hungry after that make him another ounce and then you wont be waisting as much.

rlDDTtAoaa	I see a report card that has many strengths: language, biology, pe, art, computers, religion, and pec. Remember that C is average. So for improvement, focus on history and geography. Maybe search for what you are studying online.<br>  <br>  It doesn't look like your lazy. It looks like your like me: a good student with a few weaknesses. BTW: my hs report cards looked like that and I was a 4.0 student in college.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I had a teacher, Mr. Whippley, who maintains any C grade is a decent and honorable grade - anything above that is icing on the cake.   I would be embarrassed about the Ds, but that's it.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	thats really good!!!! wow alot of A's:) good job buddy!|`|XKYP0sGQaa	I would say it is reasonably good actually. <br>  <br>  You have a mixture of good grades, average grades and poor grades.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your mum just does not think you achieved your full potential.

s4LWmcTjaa	How about staying together and NOT cheating at all?<br>  <br>  You get married because you love someone and you want to commit your life to them.  The vows say "for better or worse, forsaking all others, until death do us part".  I think too many are too quick to forget what they commit to when they marry their spouse.|`|iMULlxdgaa	well...do you call it cheating? or call it an open realtionshio.  the kids don't have to know what you guys do but why are you staying together if you'll cheat on each other? As long as you guys aren't fighting in front of the kids then  I say whatever goes , its your household.  If you guys are making living together for the kids unpleasant I would separate.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Absolutely NOT!!! If they are willing to cheat on the other person than they are obviously not that committed to their relationship or to their families. I have told my husband that if he wants to cheat on me, to divorce me first. Cheating would hurt much worse than a divorce would. The children are affected by everything that they see. You may think that they don't know what's going on, but they do. They are a lot smarter than most people think they are. My father cheated on my mother (along with many other things that he did to her and us kids) and it wasn't a happy, loving home for a long time. That affected us kids. Most of us don't want anything to do with our father. We have no respect for him.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I know a family that does this. It is just so wrong if you ask me, but the mom and dad do still live together...but they have no love life together...they are just living together and helping to support their children together. It's okay in that aspect, i would suppose, but at the same time, other aspects of it are just really messed up!|`|SJx9IWWtaa	If they are not ready to give up their love life, then why are they cheating?  That's the question to be thinking about.<br>  <br>  If a relationship has come to the point of cheating then its better to divorce.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	That's just sad......|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, if two parents ain't ready to give up on their love life together, than they shouldn't be cheating or thinking about doing it on each other. The two parents should be trying to save what they have got, not try and make it worse.So no i think that if your not happy in a relationship you need to separate because they longer it goes on, the more hurt everyone is going to have.Cheating is never a good thing to do.Good luck|`|5ZvALiclaa	definately not because the kids pick up on so much of what is going on even if you don't think they are, that you would be teaching them some pretty bad life lessons. <br>  What does dr phil say??? its better to come from a broken home than to live in one....so just separate and the kids will ultimately be better off. if mum and dad work it out then they can all move back in together and it'll be happy families again.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Kids see a lot more than parents realize.  They may not witness the cheating...but they will surely be aware of the rift & lack of respect the parents have for one another.  In the future, the children will draw on those experiences to have relationships themselves.  So they will either show now respect to their partner...or they will not GET respect from their partner!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	if they are not ready to give up then they shouldnt cheat on eachother that will only cause more problems, if they are really done and can seperate on friendly terms then they should do that, kids arent dumb they know whats going on, they would rather have two happy stable parents living serpately then unhappy fighting cheating parents under the same roof.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Either commit to each other or get a divorce.  Make up your minds!  And be civilized about it.  No calling names or snide remarks.  No using the kids as go-betweens.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i think it would be better to divorce, if you cheat theres no respect there and what does that teach the kids? if they still 'love' each other(doubt it if they cheat) marriage counselling first|`|EeabLB5eaa	Then they should stop cheating and stay together. Both ways are harmfull to children.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	It is wrong to stay together and cheat on each other and pretty sick too.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I'm confused....if the parents are not wiling to give up their love life together I'm assuming its pretty good? So why then would you need to cheat??? I think I'm missing something there.<br>  I agree with the first answer, NO WAY. Divorce. If you stay together and cheat or don't show the kids a healthy marriage they will grow up thinking your actions are normal and they will either treat someone the way you treat each other, or look for that disfunctional relationship for themselves.|`|6ErVPePEaa	No!!!! That would be way worse. Kids learn from what they see. If your kids see that you two are not happy they will learn thinking that is the way it is suppose to be. Getting divorced and letting your kids see a healthy parenting relationship is way better than staying together and cheating|`|uBAP6sqzaa	Sorry but thats just sad..
oHNrktxTaa	Sounds like you have a good chance that you may be pregnant:) Everyone is different. Remember to keep in mind that pregnancy & premenstrual symptoms are similar to each other. <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, your HCG levels are not high enough for the HPT to read. I suggest you wait a few more days & test first thing in the morning(your urine has the highest concentrate in it). The First Response Gold HPT are pretty accurate. <br>  <br>  Sending you TONS Of BABY DUST!!!!|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	your in the waitting game all u can do is wait it out til the 24th and test. gl and baby dust|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Sounds like you just might be! Another good way to tell, if your breast are tender and the areola is a different color than usual. That was the dead give away for me. That and I was getting up to pee like 10 times a night. I was only 5 days late so it can happen fast! Good luck! Children are blessings!
OCTvfDsxaa	hopefully you don't need to have one-they can be dangerous for you and your baby. I had one and I was close to delivery. They did the amniocentesis because I had to be induced into labor. The baby had low birth weight and they were concerned for her ability to breath on her own. Everything was fine but the procedure was uncomfortable. They stuck a long needle into my belly while I was awake (as you have to be for the procedure). I nearly passed out from the shock it caused to me and my body. Only do an amniocentesis if your dr. strongly suggests that you get one done.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	I don't really remember what week it is during pregnancy..I'm thinking a little after 30 wks. It's really a decision you will have to make on your own. The reason they do it is to see if your child may have something wrong with him or her. Therefore, this gives you the option of terminating the pregnancy if you want. I didn't have an amniocentesis done because I knew I wouldn't terminate the pregnancy regardless. Good luck with your decision.|`|e8573fa9e0121c92461136dfab0b3dd2aa	The amniocentesis is usually done about week 17/18.  If you are planning on keeping the baby i personally wouldn't go through with it. as there is a risk of miscarriage. The chances of this is about 1%.<br>  <br>  I was offered one, and also offered a termination but refused.  I was keeping the baby no matter what. I now have a perfect 4yr old daughter|`|zSABr7praa	The way I looked at it, if my doctor told me there could be a problem, I would wait it out, and find out at birth.  The risks of the amnio, to me, out weight the benefits.  I wouldn't terminate the pregnancy regardless of what a test said, so for me, it's pointless.<br>  Other women can't sleep at night wether or not they know the baby is safe and sound, I just couldn't risk a miscarriage.|`|MqFeJiukaa	You only get an amnio if there is a risk factor of a genetic disorder or if they need to check lung maturity for a high risk premature baby.  <br>  I had one with my 2nd because they showed a 1 in 100 risk for Downs syndrome.  I was 16 weeks.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	There are significant risks to having an amniocentesis done.  A doctor would only recommend it if there is a significant concern about a genetic disorder or hereditary disease.<br>  <br>  Some studies show that an amnio procedure can cause miscarriage, while other studies say they are generally safe...so it depends on your doctor and your particular situation.  Most would perform this procedure during the mid to end of second trimester.|`|fHgbL046aa	I could have had one but didn't. There was some concern about spina bifida and I had a ultrasound and received my results that day. I was told 95% everything is fine, but I could go ahead with the amniocentesis. However, there is only a extra 3% chance of them detecting something, and I didn't wanna risk having a miscarriage. They only do an amniocentesis if they have reason to believe there is something wrong with your baby.<br>  I am 35 and I really didn't think it would happen to me because my mom had my brother when she was 35 and she was fine and had no health scares. I'm now more excited about my baby because I really feel he or she is healthy.  Still waiting for the kicks and punches.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I believe its reccomended if your over 35 and at 11 weeks.<br>  I had one with my third child at about 24 weeks. During my high risk u/s they saw something very wrong so went ahead with the amnio not because I would ever abort but so I can know exactly whats happening. I was 25 at the time and would never have thought I would need one.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	Usually between weeks 14 to 16 they perform amniocentesis.  It's normally done if there's a higher risk of Down's syndrome or other abnormalities due to age or other factors.
96HWpdkFaa	I think your fine.<br>  I'm 8 weeks and I get scared all the time. <br>  If your under 35 and you saw the ultrasound with a healthy heartbeat misscarige goes down to 2%<br>  <br>  I know it's hard believe me! because I worry alottt!!! but if your healthy, take your prenatal vitamins and drink lots of water and get enough sleep and all that then your most liekly fine! More pregnancys go to full term and are born with healthy babies then misscariges.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Things sound very good for you... and the baby. I would say there is little chance of a miscarriage at this point.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	calm down and take a deep breath.<br>  <br>  you should feel very lucky considering you know people in the hospital that will give you as many u/s as you want, i think you would know by now if something was wrong.<br>  <br>  i worried a lot too and now i'm 16 weeks and 3 days pregnant.

But dont expect him to feel the same way about being given away.<br>  ETA<br>  Oh yeah Angelica, separating siblings is so much fun for them, (rolls eyes)|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If you don't feel bad then you don't feel bad. You aren't mentally ill. I hope the day never Com'ss when you feel bad about what you have done, because it's not a fun place to be.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Not everyone feels the same. I was adopted and I do not feel the "Primal Loss" for my first parents. I was more curious about them. Do not force yourself to feel the way other people feel. We are all individuals.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	Everyone is different. If you thought your decision through, looked at various options and decided giving your son up would be best for him; then you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  Most of the pregnant women who I've read that post here, are undecided as to whether they should give their child up. Often they'll say, I really want to keep him but I don't think I can - or the father won't be involved or some other reason that those of us with more experience know can be overcome. <br>  <br>  In those cases I always respond that if they're in doubt, don't do it! Or at least know that if they do -there will probably be alot of pain and confused feelings for them. Sometimes single mothers are feeling vulnerable and lacking in confidence and that's when people start telling them that they need to do the right thing and give up their child. Paps fly out of the woodwork and put pressure on them by making them feel too inadequate to take care of their own child. That's coercive and unfair.<br>  <br>  Of course you're not mentally ill - you at least had a choice and made it and felt comfortable with that choice. All women should have that choice and be given support if they choose to keep their child.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Mentally ill?  Don't know enough about you and your situation.<br>  <br>  Very few women/girls can dissassociate themselves from childbirth completely....its a temporary defense mechanism.  <br>  <br>  Would I say someone is mentally ill because she disassociated herself from the child she was forced to carry for months and gave birth to whose daddy was her rapist.  Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  I would say the people that manipulated her into having the child had mental illness.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No you shouldn't feel bad. If you knew he couldn't be looked after well by you and found him good parents then i have the most respect for you. Too many people have kids when they are rubbish parents. And too many 'birth parents' still call the child their child...when they aren't. they didn't raise that kid.|`|2wyDALHgaa	You are entitled to your feelings, one way or the other.  People all deal with things in different ways and if you are at peace with things then more power to you.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	No, don't feel bad at all. Everyone feels differently about adoption. Everyone feels differently about everything! Don't follow the crowd just because you feel happy or okay and feel you should be guilty about it.<br>  <br>  You did what you thought was the best for your child. If you knew the family, maybe you were completely satisfied with their character and ability to parent. Even if you don't know who the adoptive parents are, you may have an instinctual feeling that he is happy and settled. Parent's have that kind of intuitive feeling about their children. <br>  <br>  I don't blame you for giving him up and I would never wish on you the suffering and pain a lot of first mothers experience throughout their lives. It can be gut wrenching and can even mental and physical health can suffer.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Some people feel differently.  I wouldn't say it is a maturity issue.  It is a child, for crying out loud.  There is nothing immature about being separated from your children.  There is a natural bond between mothers and their children, and feeling badly and sad about giving up a child doesn't mean that you have "some growing up to do".<br>  <br>  I would say that you might be repressing some.  You might not be, who knows?  Only you know how you truly feel.  You are the one who has to live with your decision.  Well, you and the baby you gave away.  He'll have his own set of issues, though.  Maybe you can talk to a professional about it if you are concerned.  Otherwise, if you think you are fine, I guess there isn't anything you can do.  Just be sure that if it ever does start to bother you, that you find someone to talk to about it.|`|HmnAjfINaa	well to be honest if you thought that he would be better with someone who could take care of him then you cant feel bad you did it for him really though maybe it just hasnt hit you how bad you really feel, but you did it for him and now he is safe you could still visit him right? yanno to see how hes getting on so you havent lost touch and he will still know that u care for him. :)|`|1thElV58aa	You know hes in a better place where a family could raise him..<br>  <br>  theres nothing to feel wrong about it, Women who regret giving up their baby made a mistake.

Maybe this is the case for you, or maybe you are one of the 2% who never loved their baby or wanted to keep their baby.  Who knows?|`|nESfk0bXaa	Uh-huh.  Riiight.|`|hTieELhTaa	umm i dont think your crazy for not feeling bad. Its good to be honest. You must truly belive you did what was best for him and belive he is in a much better place. Now im not gonna say this to be mean or anything. I dont know your age or situation but further down the road you might end up having bad feelings. I hope not but its possible like if your young maybe when you get older settle down get  married and decide to have children you might end up woshing your son was there with you. It might not happen untill you give birth and start to raise another child. But it may never happen you may always be at peace with the decision you made. I dont think its because your crazy or emotionless but I think maybe you are just at peace with the decision you made because you know it was the right one. There is nothing wrong with being at peace and not having bad emotions about the decision you made.|`|BH9MoOQAaa	I felt good about my decision for the longest time.  There was sad mixed in for it all having to happen, but for the most part I was feeling set in my mind that I did the right thing.  Then three years or so ago, everything that I knew to be true wasn't anymore.  I had my aha moment, and all those screwed up bitter birthmothers suddenly didn't seem bitter anymore.  They seemed reasonable and ticked off for good reason.  Everything good about adoption was flipped upside down and I could no longer cling to false emotions about what was once supposedly a right choice.<br>  <br>  My son turns thirteen this year, so that is about 10 years past birth and relinquishment.  You are two years past birth and relinquishment... so very new to this path.  Give yourself time and be okay with the fact that relinquishment isn't as black or white when it comes to what was or is the best or right choice.|`|UiBslwUPaa	you shouldn't feel bad for giving your baby up. if you thought he was going to have a better life than you could give him. there are soo many people out there that cannot have children of there own and if it wasn't for adoption they wouldn't ever be parents.  you probably don't feel bad because deep down inside you know that your baby is being cared for and is loved.|`|UzGGflRfaa	HECK NO ................I gave a daughter of mine away 7 years ago......I had already had one daughter and well I was struggling with her.......It was SOOOO the best thing I could have done for her.......So just know he is in a better place and go on with what your doing. Do you still have contact?|`|WlslGIyGaa	I think you are even MORE responsible for knowing your limits, and giving him up for adoption.... You gave someone the GIFT of life.... Congratulations, it is real mature from you, and you shouldn't feel bad about it,  you know in your heart he is better off :D|`|3oSQQt6maa	If you know that your child will be happier with other parents than with you then you shouldn't feel bad.<br>  At least you gave him life and didn't go off and have an abortion. I don't think you should feel bad.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	No you are not mentally ill. You did the best possible thing you could have done for him. Kudos to you! Maybe you could look into some counseling though if you really feel you need it.|`|2A6xFP81aa	If you are "okay" then what are you doing lingering in the adoption section and reading how other mothers feel?|`|8LrnysX8aa	No, you're not mentally ill, and I think it's wonderful that you don't feel bad. You did what you thought was best for your son and gave him the opportunity to be raised by people who were ready and able to take care of a child, in a way that at the time, you did not believe yourself to be. Why on earth should you feel bad about that?<br>  <br>  As for Manx's comment, above: "I know adoption is good but think about what that boy will go through when he's older. shame on you!"<br>  <br>  Why would you expect that the boy will go through ANYTHING negative when he's older?  Many, many adoptees go through nothing of the sort!  I certainly never did, and neither did any of the adoptees I know personally.  I'm sorry if that disappoints you.|`|a6Aw90reaa	No, you shouldnt feel guilty...if you did it becuase you think he could be better off with someone esle...then you are just thinking about him....if you would have kept him and you knew you couldnt do all that he needed then he wouldnt be in the best place for him....you shouldnt feel gulity at all and if you do maybe try to contact the people you gave him to so you can atleast vist him...you dont even have to let him know who you are until later on...if at all.
mjd1EtDWaa	Be really obvious about symptoms for a few days.... Make him "figure it out".... so then he will be the one to tell you and feel smart!|`|eIjiI0M8aa	Tell him..."I know you didn't want kids for a while but...I'm pregnant." Maybe you could do it in a fun way, while still stating that same thing. Maybe make him a card or a cute note that says the same thing. Good luck. Men seem to change their minds sometimes about wanting a baby. Make him go with you to the first dr's appt. When they do the ultrasound and see/hear the heartbeat, he may change his mind. 26 is a good age to have kids...if you are prepared financially.|`|tBx1M0g9aa	okay hunni calm down sit him down and be like "hunni,i don't want to upset you but um...im pregnant and im sorry but i am and i wanna have kids"Hows that?or let him see you throwup and then say im pregnant|`|D8KgIX8naa	Your husband probably meant that he didn't want to plan having kids for another 2-3 years.

No, he doesn't want them right now, but I am pretty sure if he found out you were pregnant now he wouldn't turn his back on you. There will never be a good time for kids because they are a lifetime investment. Here I am 27 years old and my parents still help me out from time to time and probably even more since I am having a baby in 2 mo. So, that's just how it is.  He may have just said that, thinking that you don't want any.|`|AA10312653	i would say .."hey honey(or whatever your pet name is for him) rember how you said you didnt want kids for a couple of more years? i understand what you want but im afraid that your going to have to shorten that time to 9 months..........tell him you want to keep it and that your very excited about being a mother to be".............or somthing to that effect...best of luck..and congrats on the baby to be|`|0844781bb7790202c3eef84c190b3e2daa	What do you mean only 26!! that is a nice age to have a baby, just tell him your pregnant your married you should be able to talk to him, bet he will be happy xx|`|n4l6E0Saaa	I agree with MK6!

Good luck!|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Just go to him and say that we will be starting a family much sooner than you think because I am pregnant now.  I am not sure how he will take the news but do not make it seem like bad news when you are about to tell him just ease it into the conversation.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Well just sit down and tell him that LIFE had other plans for the both of you.  26 I think is a good age to have a baby.  He may be a little freaked but he'll be okay.  Good luck to you and congrats!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi,first congrats on your pregnancy!As for telling your husband, well there is no other way really but to just come out and say it to him.He is either going to be angry and take it a totally different way, or you might be surprised and he might actually be happy.Either way he needs to know.Also 26 yrs old, isn't a bad age to have a baby.Im almost 22 and i have a 11 month old baby boy and im currently 32 weeks pregnant with my second baby boy.I wouldn't change it for the world.Good luck and congrats again|`|KNxs4PrZaa	my husband said the exact same thing to me when we were 25, when i got a positive test i was shocked.  i just stareted crying, i called him at work and told him he asked why i was crying and i told him because he didnt want kids yet.  he just laughed he could never be upset about becoming a father even though it wasnt his plan, plans change,  hopefully yours will think the same way mine did, he will see waht a blessing it is and realize that really 2-3 years isnt a big difference.  plan a special dinner and tell him.  good luck|`|AA11156135	Start by saying "Look what you did to me!!!".|`|qitXGd0qaa	Tell him. Its kind of that simple. Whats done is done.
8Cvv86Jeaa	You should never miss it. If you are on it you want to take it everyday at the same time of day to lessen the chances of conceiving. One day of missed throws you into ovulation and your chances of conceiving has increased. But six months is the mark where you are a little safer. Hope this helps!
ca9dEvSAaa	Well it's different for everyone. I feel large kicks and rolls now. It's difficult to get off the floor or bed or chairs. Im so done with pregnancy I just want my baby now!|`|mZBaOGoYaa	In my opinion it's the most uncomfortable time of my life.

However, my OBGYN recently had a patient that gained 101 pounds for 1 baby.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Standard weight gain varies in pregnancy but the most I gained was 35 pounds. It comes on gradual over the entire pregnancy. My belly took most the extra weight but my ankles swelled too. I did have post partem depression badly but as for difference in my life-there isn't much. I just had to think of someone besides myself and be responsible for a second persons life now.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	In my first pregnancy I was pretty steady with the weight gain 20 in the first 20 in the second and 20 in the third! LOL about a year before I got pregnant I lost 100 pounds (because of digestive problems) and I had no butt and no chest after I got prego I immediatly got my butt back! LOL <br>  Now I'm 34 weeks with my second and I was steady at 2 pounds a month for the first six then in the 7th and 8th I gained 12 then nothing for 3 weeks then 6 inthe past 2 weeks so I've had an adventure! <br>  <br>  I can't wait til it's over!|`|USPvOd7Kaa	I gained about 65 lbs when I was pregnant.  I think it was gradual throughout the pregnancy.  My thighs, hips, and bum got bigger.  (Of course belly--but there was a baby in there :)  I am still working on losing weight, I have about 20 lbs more to go but honestly, I don't feel like I look too bad right now.  I workout at the gym and I feel healthy.  I think my hips are permanently bigger, I think the bones spread and made my hips bigger.  I did have a flat tummy prior to pregnancy and I don't think I will get that back so that makes me a little sad but I have a precious child now--she is well worth everything I went through to get her here.|`|Sz8KiJuvaa	i gained over 60 lbs with my daughter. she was my first pregnancy. i moved far from all my family and friends to be with my husband whos in the airforce so i was home alone so i ate due to depression and bordem. i was unable to work because i got so sick early on in the pregnancy. im losing it slowly now but god im so mad at myself for letting myself gain so much to begin with but i look at my daughter and think no matter what it was all worth it to haveher in my life|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	with my 1st i gained 45 - 50 lbs most in the first trimester i lost it quickly with breast feeding & it was rather noticable in my butt & stomache lol<br>  but i am 7 months with my second & havent gained a lb but the funny thing is i feel bigger with the 2nd then the 1st|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	so far 20lbs! i know that's a lot but i don't really eat bad so i guess i'll just roll with it and work really hard to get it off afterward. my baby tummy, hips and butt are big but the rest looks the same so i feel a little dumpy and awkward sometimes.|`|vpRERM9jaa	60? damn, my mom gained like 40|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	With my first (a Daughter) I gained nearly 50 lbs, but I also only started at 112.

With my second (a Son) I gained about 40 and was active as well through-out, but this time I started around 118.<br>  <br>  Both times I gained in my butt and thighs.  I lost most of the baby weight from my Daughter in about a month and a half (vigorous workouts daily between Pilate's and cardio).  The remaining 10-15lbs melted off slowly over a two year period.  For some reason the work outs wouldn't drop it.  With my Son it has taken me the last 6 months to drop to pre-baby weight with little to no effort (I was just too lazy this time around, l0l)<br>  <br>  After both babies my body shape was drastically changed, no matter how close I was/am to pre-baby weight; old clothes don't fit because of it.  Weird, but it was well worth it of course. =0]<br>  <br>  I forgot to add that all of my weight kinda piled on in the beginning of the second trimester.  Before and after that I was slow to gain.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	Im actually worried because I am 21 weeks and I have only gained 8 total but Im sure its gonna get worse...:)|`|AA10780655	With my first, I gained about 70 pounds gradually<br>  Now Im 39 weeks with my second and have gained 60 pounds so far.

Just take a little in a bowl, and put it in the microwave for 8-10 seconds.  Put it on your skin, and leave it for 15 minutes.|`|iZk9jEBpaa	Use tooth paste over night but not the gel the paste, it reduces swelling and redness and generally shrinks the size of the spot.|`|6lSbmXunaa	I use Proactiv and I very rarely have any zits. But, it doesn't work for everybody. Try different acne medications, you'll find which one works best for your skin. For now, try some home remedies:<br>  <br>  - Drink lots of water throughout the day to flush the toxins out of your body which might help to lighten your condition<br>  <br>  - Cleanse your skin 3-5 times daily with a specialized acne cleanser or an unscented soap.<br>  <br>  - Exercise regularly to reduce your stress level which will indirectly help to improve your skin condition<br>  <br>  - Lime juice mixed with groundnut oil may be good treatment for acne and pimples<br>  <br>  Quick Ways:<br>  <br>  - Apply a bit of toothpaste on the affected area before bed to reduce irritation and redness.<br>  <br>  - Mix three table spoons of pure honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. Apply it on the pimples and leave it there overnight. Wash it the following morning with warm water. Continue this for several weeks to achieve results.<br>  <br>  More Tips:<br>  <br>  -Don't touch your face- especially places where you get a lot of zits or if you already have them. Your hands are very oily and will get oil on your face, causing more acne.<br>  <br>  -Don't eat too many greasy foods.

Find out the reason for behaviour and explain to him that its not ok and maybe have daddy there during the discussion since the kid may have more respect for daddy.  Counseling is adviced|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	My son had a very violent temper from about 18 months old until 12 yrs. It wasn't a daily thing, or even a weekly thing, more like monthly or bimonthly. No clear trigger, couldn't figure out what was setting him off, much less how to help him regain his self control. <br>  <br>  Come to find out... he's bipolar. He was having some serious mood swings. It took us awhile, but we finally found the right medication, and his violent episodes are a thing of the past.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying her son is bipolar, but it couldn't hurt, to make a list of inappropriate behaviors, as well as to keep a calender of these events, and go see someone about it.|`|nU7qyXkVaa	Some suggestions:<br>  <br>  If it is a frequent thing, try starting a behavior chart. This can be for anything including hitting that is against the house rules. If he has a good day, put a sticker on his chart. If he hits or breaks any other rules, no sticker. Have a goal in mind of 10 stickers or something and once he reaches it he can earn something. Letting him choose the reward so he can be more motivated to behave. Rewards (a reasonable one.. not Disney or something outrageous) can be anything from a new toy to time spent one on one with a family member. <br>  <br>  If it's not frequent, have you tried time-outs or taking away privileges?|`|TuLZwRObaa	MK6's is good.<br>  if hes hitting her there is a serous prob going on! she needs more discipline over him showing him no hitting or time out etc. if she brings a male friend into the house often her son  could get a male role model while her husband is away to show no hitting.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	she needs to put him across her lap and smack him across the bottom!|`|dB6MR0wYaa	acting out like that is a symptom of adhd|`|Z5rIQE7Gaa	I can't see wasting money on a psychologist. He will probably outgrow this but I think the best is to reward him for good behavior when he doesn't hit which will encourage him to behave better. Dad and mom can sit down together and talk about this to him, about the plan and the reward system. <br>  <br>  I'd also suggest taking him to Sunday school to learn about God and how he should obey his parents. Also get godly people to pray for him. He'll get better.<br>  <br>  Kids have different temperments. Some kids you just need to look at sternly and they just fall in line. Some kids are just naturally more obedient than others. This child is very strong-willed. One thing about strong-willed kids is that they can become great leaders.<br>  <br>  Parents of kids who are more compliant tend to be self-righteous and say, "oh, that mom really needs to get her act together. I would never let a child get away with that. That mom needs a good child rearing book."<br>  <br>  I'm sure the mom is doing the best that she can. <br>  I see no reason that he is adhd. The last thing the kid needs is labels and drugs. I'm sure his school finds him challenging too. Time is a great equalizer. He'll be over this soon enough.

5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	My son will turn 3 next month & I have already started teaching him about God.  He attends church w/ me & he has a few religious children books that we read.  He will be raised w/ Christian teachings.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We are not religious but my parents are quite religious.  I expect that when he is a bit older I'll let them take him to church - mostly to show him off to their church friends!<br>  <br>  It may lead to some hard questions eventually, but even though I'm not religious now I spent a lot of my childhood in church and am comfortable there. And I know my theology more than many Christians.  We'll figure it out, explain it as best we can and let him make his own choices when he's older.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes i believe in God and hope my son will to i will bring him to church get him babtisied but when he gets older he can make his own religious decision that is not mine to make <br>  but ill let him now about my faith <br>  and weve been going to church so when he asks questions ill answer him|`|Gem96NQyaa	It's not like having the sex talk with your kid.  There's no prescribed age or maturity level.  Kids pick up on religious beliefs through all kinds of things you do and say in everyday life.  Most Christian parents begin bringing their kids to church at a fairly early age... can't speak for other religions, as I wasn't raise in any of them.|`|acj9mB9Paa	We are Messianic Jewish and we take my son to worship every week!  We pray with him, read him stories about G-d and Jesus and and talk to him about how much G-d loves him!  He is 21 months old.  We did this from birth.  They pick up so much so early, why leave such and important part of their education until later???|`|rAkWoweOaa	I will talk about God every day and pray with him every day. I want him to know that the Lord is our savior and died for our sins.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	If someone is religious, it will be a part of the child's life from toddler hood and past.|`|yewpjlDqaa	I'm Catholic, my husband is Hindu. I think teaching children about religion and God is something that happens organically over time. I wouldn't have a "sit down" discussion with a toddler. Children that age have a hard time understanding complex concepts such as religion. Better to be simple and dumb things down. Too much information is confusing. I like the idea of just saying God is in the sky and he loves you very much and looks after you. <br>  <br>  I plan to just teach my child to be a good person and be kind and compassionate -- that's the core of my spirituality.  I may enroll her in a catholic elementary school when she's older. If not, then I would send her to CCD.|`|W8Ljtah3aa	I, personally, do enforce my children of religion. They do know of God, and we go to church every Sunday and they do attend Bible School. I think that how early a child is enforced of God, depends on the parents preferences. Some parents want their child to be able to explore different religions, and some want to raise their children under their religion and beliefs.|`|1S7uXsInaa	We go to church and i let my daughter ask questions.  She has not shown much interest, but that will come in time. . .let's face it, church as a child is not a lot of fun.  Next year she will be in 1st grade and we will be enrolling her in religious classes.  I want her to go through the process of communion and confirmation, but by no means does that mean when she is older she has to follow through.  It will be her choice.  My husband was given no guidance as a child and had to complete the classes as as adult before we were married, I guess he didn't have to but wanted to.  It was hard between college and work, so at least they will have something to grasp onto.|`|Q7jMH5praa	My husband and I decided to teach our son about all religions and let him decide which one he wants to follow. I am a Christian but I will not force my religion on anyone let alone my son. Though I do hope he will decide to be Christian.|`|toqMrT25aa	I know i have talking about God to them since they were in my womb. We always say a prayer before anything and everything .|`|gPg7qYGIaa	that depends if u believe in god and wont your baby to be raised with your beliefs then yes as soon as the understand but if your like me and don't believe there is a good then i leave it until they ask u
vygYFdsSaa	Honestly I don't think there's a chance in hell that you are pregnant. Why not use a condom if you're so paranoid?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pretty slim BUT precum can contain sperm if the boy had ejaculated previously in the night and not urinated between ejaculations. It's best that you to wear condoms or you get on birth control to be safe.|`|oaJcgz3uaa	There is a small chance, not necessarily due to the ejaculate, but to the precum.  It's a pretty low chance that women can become pregnant off of precum, so you're probably okay.  You should use some form of birth control next time.  Nothing is worth that kind of stress.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Eww anal sex is unlikely to get you pregnant but you are still prone to stds and other problems.<br>  Plus your partner can get a real nasty bladder infection from doing anal without a condom on.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Probably not, but you need to see a doctor for birth control.|`|cK6FBsdnaa	little chance.|`|v8rTBGoIaa	probably not. if it wasn't in you when he ejaculated than it's impossible. sperm dies when air hits it. so it's highly, highly unlikely. i wouldn't stress about it (:

7wkHVaNyaa	Your sudden feeling is because you are having issues with partner, deep down you want to feel unconditionally loved and u feel maybe a baby will fill that need as well as keep a permanent connection with ur partner. If u are having probs now, it would be unfair to a baby to bring him/her into a relationship like that. It would be selfish and for wrong reasons.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	Hormones make you feel all kinds of things you're not sure you feel or not.<br>  <br>  Try very hard to separate your personal feelings on the matter and the urges your hormones are giving you.<br>  <br>  Babies are cool.  At the right time, in the right situation, they're wonderful.  <br>  <br>  But it's possible to get a good thing at the wrong time and wind up in a very bad situation.  Don't add stress by taking on such an enormous responsibility when you already have a bunch of garbage to deal with.<br>  <br>  I'd say most women have "baby lust."  I know I have.  No relationship in sight, no house, crap job, poor health...and a baby seemed like a good idea.  Geez.  Save me from myself!<br>  <br>  I'm more stable now, health-wise, financially, emotionally.  I'm getting to where a baby seems like a much better option.  Fortunately, I didn't get myself into a situation I really couldn't handle.  <br>  <br>  Get happy with who you are and what you're doing first.  Then, a baby will be a much better thing to bring into your life.|`|oHNrktxTaa	No, of course it is not weird. It is completely normal for women to want a baby. It is a "nurturing" part of us. <br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that having a baby will not solve relationship problems & all. It should be based at the right time:)<br>  <br>  Good luck & sending you future baby dust!|`|QczEdd5qaa	hmmm depends why you want the baby?<br>  <br>  do you want the baby to solve your problems?<br>  <br>  or just to be happy and form a family?|`|aSso3n7oaa	Most women, at one point in their lives, want to have a child. Probably because woman are the only ones who have the capability to have children, so they want to take advantage of it and experience it. It's not weird, it's normal. <br>  <br>  But, if you're having problems with your parter, maybe you should wait until times are better for you and you're parter. Exspecially if it's finacial problems. Having children are very expensive.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	actually it is pretty normal.<br>  as you're in trouble with ur partner then u want someone to feel close to.<br>  and a baby is pretty amazing.

Every person has periods of "baby fever" even at inopportune times. Maybe it's spiked now because you feel the need for some unconditional love.  Or maybe you're like a lot of us who just go through periods when we can't get enough of the little cuties and this just happens to be your first time feeling it.|`|sbxDX97uaa	no it's not weird|`|nZpSM7ngaa	question is not if you want a baby,  do you have the time, money, and patience for one.|`|7vcoonkuaa	Depending on how old you are, it may just be a natural urge.  I am going through that right now.  Unfortunately, I lost my baby 2 weeks ago and I want so much to have a child.  No my husband and I are not having problems but I do not think it is weird that you want a baby.  Sometimes babies can make a relationship stronger with your spouse, but sometimes babies can literally break your relationship.  If this person is just your partner, I would not stop taking the pill.  Its better to have problems when you are married under a REAL covenant than to have problem under no covenant at all.  Under a REAL covenant, it is harder for a person to just give up and walk away.  Under no covenant, the person can leave any time.

I would wait until your child at least talks or can have his or her 1st memorable memory. 15 months is a bit too early. wait till your child is around 3 or 4.|`|8ab40e110856e04b57a0ea78b7f1ea14aa	Wow!! We are actually going to Disney on Ice this weekend!!    For my daughter we waited till she was 3 years old , and she sat and watched it.. liked it a lot..     But as you may know, Disney comes to town ever 2-3 years.. so we took her again at 5 years old she LOVED IT!!    This go around we are taking my daughter now 7, a 21 year old, and a 10 month old.. along with Mommy(me) and Daddy.  I look at it this way, if your baby doesn't want to sit still, then if you have others with you, you can all take turns walking around with them, or hold them on your lap facing the show, and they might fall asleep.    Only thing is, I think after 1 year old, you have to purchase their own ticket! And Disney tickets are not that cheap!    I hope if you go, your baby does well, and you all enjoy the show!!
rAkWoweOaa	My husband is all cowboy. He can't even turn a computer on, seriously! lol. I gave him my blackberry the other day to make a call and he was so confused, it was very funny. Bless his heart. It is funny though to see a man on the newborn and baby section.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	My husband doesn't actually use it like by answering questions but he will go to certain sections to see if someone may have a question like him. Now I had a friend use my Y/A account, thus what prompted me to start being on here. I had no clue about Y/A and now I'm addicted.|`|lGcpXteaaa	No, he actually pokes fun at me for going on Y/A! He says i have no life because i'm pretty addicted i must say and everytime Mia sleeps i have to come on for a few minutes :)|`|14JQ11AUaa	Yes he does lol. I told him to start his own account...his reply "No, I want you to get those points!"|`|GPkcg8Rqaa	My 26 year old husband doesn't even have an email account!!!  He's really not into many of the things most guys his age are...he also gets mad at me for being on here so much especially the trying to conceive...he think it just makes me more stressed lol<br>  But if he wanted to go on I'd have no problem...in fact I'd love it if he took an interest in one of the things that occupies so much of my down time :P|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	No, my husband doesn't use it, but he hears all about the Q&As I find interesting on here. He finds some of it comical and is shocked at some of the things on here. Of course, he finds it helpful when I get info about something relating to our baby.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	No, he doesn't.  I've told him that he can if he wants to, but he isn't into the whole Y!A thing.  He tells me that I'm addicted enough as it is.  We don't need two people in this household addicted to this site.  lol|`|cv0foxlTaa	No, my husband isn't an internet junkie like me.  It took me over a year to convince him to get a Facebook account and now that he has one he never checks it.  lol!|`|lKsIKKm2aa	Maybe if I did it on the computer he might, but I use my iPhone!! He's pretty into the questions I talk about though and asks me sometimes how today went on Y!A ...|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	no. never.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	No, but he is amused by how often I am on it.  What can I say?  It is my only adult connection!|`|AA11210211	No my hubby has his own account and he usually stays in the manly sections!!! lol|`|CVdcrY3kaa	No. My husband calls this the nosey people website. lol
miFe45quaa	I like Eileen. It's nice.<br>  I never knew it was the English form of Eibhlin, which is the Irish form of Old French Aveline...which orginates from German Ava.<br>  Interesting.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Eileen! Love love it. I had / have a co-worker named Eileen. I say had / have because although I am not working at Disney right now, I am still an employee.<br>  <br>  I do not care for Lysandra, but I do like Lysander for a boy.|`|MSGixNibaa	I prefer Lysandra. Eileen sounds very dated to me. However, I prefer the masculine Lysander over both.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Lysansdra|`|aIjOfkM8aa	Lysandra|`|9ccCHZHgaa	Eileen.|`|47M20WOUaa	Defiantly different But I like them all|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Eileen.<br>  Although, I don't love either name.|`|SxPhldhhaa	I'd have to pick Lysandra over Eileen. Eileen is very pretty, but it just seems a little dated to me and the Ei- beginning is bothering me for some reason. I think I'd like it a little better if spelled Isleen or Aileen (although I know those look terribly misspelled). The Ei- beginning just makes it look a little harsh and strange.<br>  <br>  Lysandra seems a little too fantasy-like to be in my top ten, but I do like how it sounds exotic but still pretty and how it flows off of your tongue easily. I also like it because there are just so many cute nickname options - Lyla, Lissa, Lissie, Sandra, Sandy, Andra, Andi, and so on.<br>  <br>  I do, however, prefer Aveline over both of them. It just looks very sweet and pretty.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Are you Macedonian?<br>  <br>  Eileen is better, as it is an actual reasonably common name.|`|sPOmz9wUaa	Lysandra! It sounds better Eileen sounds like a grandma name, no offense if thats your name. Also keep in mind what nicknames come w, both names|`|xXHiyuBaaa	Lysandra|`|Mclot3ewaa	I would pick eileen but i really dont like either sooo old fashioned|`|1TgCidVPaa	I dont like either but if I had to pick then it would be Eileen.|`|EygONgVjaa	I like eileen better but dislike them both....sorry|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Eileen|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Lysandra|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Lysandra is so unique and exotic! I prefer Lysandra. It would be a good alternative to the very pretty but overused Alexandra.|`|yNxYYHszaa	I hate both but if I had to pick I'd go with Lysandra. At least you can give it a cute nickname. Like Lizzie, Lissy, Sandra.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Eileen.|`|02E66ClWaa	I like Eileen but Lysandra is very unusual. I think both are great!!!
vhUFH61zaa	hi,<br>   your 4th preg son...<br>  will msg u after ur LABOUR...
AA11240422	i think that you should try your son on the biscuits and you will soon find out if he likes them or not. if not then just don't give them to him. he is at the age where his teeth will be growing so he needs to start eating solids. i first gave my child them at 4 months, around the same age and he loved them. i found that they do help with the teething pain.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	I would probably wait a little while longer on the teething biscuits. I would probably wait until 6 months. My daughter had mum-mums (rice rusks found at walmart) around 6 months but she had teeth.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I have tried them with my son (he is 5 months) and he hates them|`|0qP8gLpyaa	i gave them to my son around that age but to be honest they were messy and he never really liked any of them. I quit buying them for that reason. He never liked the mesh feeder things either. He would taste it and hand it to me with this look of "what the heck am I supposed to do with this junk?" kind of look on his face. He never really used it. <br>  What I found worked best was take a baby size wash cloth, tie a knot in it, get it damp and toss it in the freezer. I kept a few like that in a plastic bag and would wash them as used. Those worked the best. <br>  The other thing that I found worked well for him to chew on during teething was to just keep chunks of soft fruit in the fridge and let him pick it up and eat it. Banana chilled a little while was a hit as were chilled little pieces or pears or peaches.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is 7 months old and hasn't had one yet, she's teething but I just haven't tried it. My friend has a baby girl who's 10 months old and she loves them, I'm not sure when she first tried them though.|`|AA10064551	My son is 6 months and I just tried one the other day, he did good on it but it was very messy and the cookie get dry and stick to his face. I rather not give it to him but I only bought them because everyone insists on letting him try food (adult) and I didn't like them doing that but they don't listen so I told them if you really feel the need to feed him just give him the cookie. <br>  <br>  IF I were you I think I would wait until he is about a month older to try the cookie. but perhaps and try giving him more stage one veggies, he needs to get used to non sweet foods before introducing him to sweet foods (the cookie is sweet) once he like the veggies then start the some fruits and then introduce the cookies once he is used to eating more.|`|os36Q3P2aa	My 1st baby was around 5months when i firt gave him a teething biscuit ...my youngest is 9months old and what i done with him  and still do is peel a carrot and wash it (a WHOLE one) then give it to him. where its been in the fridge its cool on his gums  . and he loves it !!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	That's about how old my son was when he had his first one. He loved it and he still loves them. He started the drooly stage around then to but here he is 9 months and still no teeth. Lol one of these days.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It depends on if your child likes them or not honestly. I say go ahead and try to give him one and see if he likes them. He is old enough for them.
aJLx0nhNaa	There is disagreement on this issue.  My pediatrician also said we could mix large batches and keep for 24 hours.  Some new guidelines say not to do that.<br>  <br>  Since your son is a newborn and they don't eat a lot at one time anyway, you might want to wait before you do this.  That's what we did - mixed each bottle individually until he was about 4 months old.<br>  <br>  Now I use the Dr Browns Pitcher, which I think is rather worth it. It mixes the formula better than any other method. However we do not store it in the pitcher, we store it in bottles.<br>  <br>  I know you've been through a lot of stress recently with your newborn.  Please ignore Fajina - she means well, but she's a bit one-note about breastfeeding.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I personally find it easier to make one bottle at a time, but a glass pitcher should work just fine.  Why do you want to make more than 4 bottles at a time?  Remember that you should never heat premixed formula in the microwave.  It heats it unevenly.|`|sMukgX7Xaa	If you are using powder formula you mix it individually. If you are using the liquid formula ( I did for 3 wks. with first child) I used a regular tea pitcher with a lid. The dr. said that was fine and it worked well.|`|hFoYmSgqaa	i make the bottles up individually, it is easier than making up one lage amount, it is also more hygenic and can be kept for 24hours in the fridge.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	You are supposed to mix the bottle fresh before each feeding.<br>  If you are going to use formula it is the least you can do!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You don't.  Formula doesn't keep (even refrigerated) and you can make your baby sick.|`|SVuYaK8maa	I used a glass one.  You can get them anywhere.  Only thing is some don't have lid's.  Also you can keep in in the frig.  Just only as the can say's.  I did both for my kid's the liquid  and powder. The powder though you can not pre-mix cuz it wont stay that way.  Also you could call you child's ped.  They could help you with that.  Maybe even WIC.  Even if your not on it.   (Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program)<br>  <br>  But best luck.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I MADE THEM UP INDVIDUALLY AT NIGHT FOR THE NEXT DAY
P2yRAWiJaa	If you don't want to have a child because there are so many out there that already need homes AND you know you could have a bio child if you wanted to (but choose not to) -- DO IT!!!<br>  <br>  You only have to be 21 in most cases. Especially if you adopt from foster care.  The children there may be 4 or older. Some are special needs (older, mental problems, problems needing meds, physical issues, different races, etc) and all have been traumatized *obviously*.  However, they really need good/loving/stable/forever homes!!!<br>  <br>  As long as you have enough money to support yourself, and not be in the hole each month...and you are 21. You are well on your way to being approved. Oh yeah, no "bad" background checks either. :)|`|Of7KEsnXaa	DO you want to adopt a newborn, or are you ok with adopting older children, possibly a sibling group?  <br>  <br>  Adopting a healthy white newborn takes lots of time and money and things are often not done ethically. Also newborn babies really don't need a home. Most go home with their mother, and the ones who are placed for adoption, well they end up as commodities to adoption agencies and lawyers. <br>  <br>  Adopting older children, and sibling groups from foster care on the other hand costs little to nothing and gives a home to children who REALLY need it. There is a huge list of ppl wanting the newborn  but not as many lined up for older kids and sibling groups.|`|8DN2jyRsaa	ah yes,always a very emotive decision this one.i can't begin to imagine what it's like,for someone who's been adopted.on the one hand,feeling that you were abandoned by your real parents, yet chosen by another.sounds like you've had a good life so far,with very loving parents,but i think you should wait awhile,and experience all that life has to offer you,you're still very young,and as such have your whole life ahead of you.if you still feel strongly about adoption in the future,then good for you.|`|QQhe3NmHaa	Maybe you should wait a bit longer, so you have done more with your life first.|`|tbKZLynQaa	Most agencies will not allow you to adopt that young.  You might be able to find one that would, but it's doubtful.  I love that you are considering adoption since there are so many children in the world.  I'm a big supporter of older child and sibling adoption.  I really dont think adopting an infant is much of a noble thing to do since there are so many people that want them so they really aren't in need of a home.  But the older kids and siblings do.|`|8LrnysX8aa	Oh, that's easy. You should begin trying to adopt about 3-5 years before you expect to actually want to become a mom.<br>  <br>  What's that? You say you're not psychic? Oh, too bad. It would make things a lot easier...<br>  <br>  Seriously, though, are you ready to become a mother?  Do you have a partner, or other people in your life who are committed to helping you raise a child?  Are you finished with your education?  Do you have a stable income -- or at least, as stable as it can be in this economy?<br>  <br>  Raising children is really hard work, and it's time-consuming, and it's best done with help from others, and it costs a lot of money. Kids can't go without a lot of the things that adults might be willing to forego when times get tight.  But only you can know if you're sure that your life is in a stable enough place that you're ready to become a mother.|`|GeqMrX9laa	i don't think age matters when it comes to adopting! i think adopting is such a good thing because you are giving a child a home and a family and if you don't want to have kids of your own then i think that is fine because at the end of the day it's your choice not anyone elses.|`|tRsobsD3aa	I think adoption is a great thing to choose. No 22 is not too young to adopt. When people have children they are being selfish because there are many children in the world that need a nice caring and loving home. But i understand why some would like to have a blood based family. (if you could call it that)|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Research first before you start the adoption process so you prepare yourself.  Ethical adoptions are good but there are still unethical adoptions going on.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	If you are financially stable and have support I think any age (once you are legally an adult) is fine for adopting. Some people mature earlier than others and are ready at a younger age. You will probably run into some trouble adopting because of your age though. Many agencies/countries have rules in place that require the adoptive parent to be at least 25 years old. <br>  <br>  If its something you feel strongly about start researching now. It can take a year+ depending on which form of adoption you decide to go with.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	22 seems a bit young.  before starting a family, you should make sure your education is finished and you have a stable job. live a little!  travel and do all the things you want before being tied down with kids. wait til you're closer to 30
w3ob12X6aa	i wouldnt leave it because your stomache will strech so much. i left mine in until i was 5 months prego and i got a big strech mark from it. and it really isnt that cute when you have a big  belly and its pierced but i would take it out and mine didnt close so its back in now.|`|E8wkkN38aa	You can leave your belly button ring in till your about 5 months, but some people leave them in till full term depends on how big you get! You can also buy pregnancy belly bars for around $20, they are plastic and longer than normal bars leaving room for your stretching belly!|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	Ask a professional piercer in your area.  I have the same issue, but mine is both nipples and a vertical hood piercing, just have to follow directions to a T!|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm 8 weeks pregnant and I still have my belly ring in, I'll probably take it out when my baby bump starts coming. Then I'll probably put it through the hole every couple days to try to make the hole not close up.<br>  <br>  (It said to do that in the book "What to expect when your expecting"<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND BABY DUST!!!
UjEAn0bWaa	OMG pregnant!  It might be twins|`|VFEjLgvuaa	well first and foremost it wont do you any good to test yourself if you havent missed a period and second off its very possible to get pregnant on pre *** its steel *** and I got pregnant with my second child on pre *** so.... Also, by using internet cheapies your only costing yourself in the long run go to a dollar general or family dollar and get one of there 3 dollar tests they always worked for me and they are cheap. You may be pregnant and it sounds like youre having some symptons but the tests wont show anything until you have missed a period and for the most accurate results wait until youre a week late and take it first thing in the morning as it will have more hcg(pregnancy hormone) in the morning than any other time of day. Good luck and best wishes|`|gssmVH4Haa	The only way your going to know if your pregnant is by doing another pregnancy test.  The symptoms you've listed are signs of pregnancy but are also signs of a period coming. Sometimes when you convince yourself your pregnant you sort of imagine that your full of symptoms as strange as it sounds.  Do another test a couple of days after your due.  Hope you get the result you want.

Except there is no running from this, it will follow you for the rest of your life. When you do grow up and get a real job, you will owe so much in back pay. You can have your drivers license taken away and not get it back until you are all paid up. You can go for 50/50 custody but I bet with your attitude you'll never win. Grow up and support your child!!|`|6ErVPePEaa	Wow what a man you are... Good thing the child doesnt have you in its life. You have to pay child support. you made it you help raise it. you should go get yourself fixed|`|A7SjBofFaa	don't be stupid they both deserve some money that you make i hope they get all that money to them if you don't pay i hope they throw your stupid *** in jail!
yH39NEXSaa	I usually keep them in a Word Document too. Just to open up and make changes when I'm bored or have free time. <br>  <br>  I have boys names on one page with origins and meanings and girls name on another page.

If you guys are not married and might not even stick together give your baby your last name|`|FfGHHhqBaa	i think it is an honor for a father to give his child his last name, give the baby daddy's name.|`|mZBaOGoYaa	I'm not traditional so I would use my last name. If not that you can always hypenating both of your names.|`|zwctZ812aa	I would give the baby his last name. It's tradition, and even if you two don't stay togther, it's still his baby.  I don't think your baby's last name should have anything to do with your relationship with his or her father.  I gave my son my boyfriend's last name and we're not married, but he wants to be a father, so his son gets his last name.  I just like the tradition.  If you think he is going to be an absent father, than that's a diferent story.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Give the baby his last name.it`s his baby..It took both of ya`ll to make the baby!not just YOU.that`s kinda selfish.me and my boy friend ain't married!But we plan on staying together!But i`m definitely giving my baby his daddy`s last name!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You 2 should discuss this, when I had my son, my husband and I weren't married at the time, and he automatically was given my name.  I had to change it to my husbands last name myself.<br>  <br>  Give the baby your last name for now, and then change it later if you feel.  I think a child should have the fathers last name as long as he is in their life and a big part of it.|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	It's normally a tradition and an honor to give the baby his last name, but if you don't want to do that, you could always give the baby your last name and your boyfriends with a hyphen in between them.|`|4cehW3S9aa	If you know who the father is, then it should be his last name.  Whether or not you stay together, he is still the father and deserves the child to have his name...its a traditional thing anyways.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	It's up to you. I'mgiving my baby my boyfriend's last name and we're getting married soon after the birth.
96HWpdkFaa	I take that..I started taking it before I conceived (only like 2 weeks before hand) and I am now 8 weeks pregnant. I don't know if it's from the vitamins..but you should take them when you get pregnant as well..they are basically just prenatal vitamins and good for you and the baby.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	It can not hurt.  Folic acid is recommend for women who are trying to become pregnant and while pregnant.  It helps reduce birth defects in the early stage of pregnancy.|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	any vitamin with folic acid in them will help. gl and baby dust
hpnZ8awvaa	I dunno if that's true.. But i think that men are treated unfairly in court etc|`|E5CnUdhsaa	if a child lived with there father the mom would have to pay child support...but anyway theres so many facts in there i forgot what your banging on about already.oh es i remember... i as a single parent, do not interfere with my childs right to see her father unles there is very cause too. and court orders can be breached with valid reason when it comes to a childs safety, however there are some spiteful moms out there that i cant make sense of myself.<br>  <br>  men should have to pay child support, as should women if they dont have full custody. its fair!!!!! it works both ways, i dont see why that has anything to with woman having trouble finding a husband. and many woman choose to get a sperm donor because they dont WANT a man not because they cant trust hell cough up if they end thee relationship.<br>  <br>  so no that little rant did not make sense at all, yur facts are all wrong mr|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	It is not the case.<br>  <br>  72% of all statistics are made up on the spot.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Where exactly did you get this information from? When my daughter's father got to see her I never interfered.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Your stats are a little bit off.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	because friday the 13th feel on a full moon.  sometimes jupiter is in orbit too.  i'm not sure if mars plays into this or not.  i know the gravitational pull can be quite strong.
Q05rrSX4aa	Mine was!  He was moving around inside me all the time, constantly!!  He is 7 and is VERY hyper active, very.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	My mom said she thought I was going to be a footballer, cause i kicked and moved around all the time. But I am really laid back
93TC1Yxlaa	Since your baby is older and does not nurse during the night, your body's natural rhythm has adjusted to this pattern.  During the day since your child is nursing more frequently, your body knows this and is sending you signals that it is time to nurse. Just the thought of nursing can create a letdown. Pretty amazing, isn't it?|`|lKsIKKm2aa	Boobs are smart<br>  =0)|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	That's what people mean when they talk about your supply regulating to meet demand.  Isn't it great?|`|baI5G8yLaa	Your body is used to not feeding her thorught the night!<br>  your body just knows when to feed and if it is a well establised feeding pattern then thats what happens!<br>  <br>  Im exactly the same!|`|dPmK83UYaa	This is probably a cause of your mind not sending signals to your milk ducts that your baby is hungry! :-) While your asleep you don't have the same stimulations you do when you are awake, this is why they tell mommies to have a  picture of the baby to help them when they are pumping. Unless you are engorged and lay on your side hard enough to "express" the milk out. You won't leak much or at all.
43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Sounds like he's talking fine for  a 19 month old.  18 month olds repeat a lot and say random words, but I wouldn't say they talk well...  My first son did not really start to talk until he was 2 1/2 yrs old and that was after he started speech therapy.  He was really smart, knew lots of sign language, could say about 5 words (none of which where mommy or daddy), and could even point at the letters of the alphabet if I asked him where was 'c' or something.  He understood everything, just couldn't talk.  I tried everything.  It was just me and him most of the day, so I talked to him all the time.  He wouldn't even repeat.  I don't know what happened, but soon after he started getting speech therapy his speech skyrocketed.  Now he talks non-stop and he's 4 1/2 yrs.  His speech is pretty unclear though so he still gets speech therapy.  My second son is 18 months, repeats a lot, and knows quite a bit of words.  The only two word phrase he says is 'bye daddy', but he can say our cat's name, mommy, daddy, bye, hi, up, help, cat, ball, pop, and a few other things.  So I'm pretty happy.  But anyway, it sounds like your son is normal and if your doctor had been worried they would have told you.  :-)  If you are still concerned every state has a free program for getting your child's development tested and receiving services if necesary.  It's called early interventions.  You can look it up for your state on the internet.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	My son is almost 2 and he says short sentences( what is that?  I want____, where's that), please, thank you, yes, no, momma, daddy, dog, uh-oh, juice, eyes, nose, ears, all his animal sounds, tea, up, down, yum,hi, bye, cheese, milk, fish, hush, bed, bath, yuck, names of some his extended family,monkey, car, go, zoom, I did, Bubba (his bear), socks, ball, feet  and numerous other things.  He started when he was around a year old getting his vocabulary.  <br>  Some of his stuff still sounds like babble talk but he is talking more and more. He can say stuff now that other people understand him when he says it, but some of it is still his own "toddler speak" that only a mom would understand what he's saying.<br>  Just keep reading to him, naming things and talking in normal speech to him. It will come. He probably knows more than he's letting on right now. I wouldn't worry. No kid ever went to preschool unable to talk.  If you're concerned mention it to your doctor until you get an answer you're satisfied with.|`|AA10494763	She said over 50 words by 12 months and small sentences by 15-16 months and big sentences before 2|`|80A6iHoGaa	My daughter was talking before she was a year old and my son is now 18 months and he doesnt say much..doctor said boys are alittle slower than girls|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Perhaps he just doesn't have anything to say?|`|1s3nddaYaa	sounds like my son. he will say hey like 20 times when someone walks in or something, or just randomly lol. he can say 12 words. he is 16 months tho.  i heard you don't they don't start speaking a lot till like 2 or so. but babys go at there own age. when he is ready he will talk and you will want him to hush lol|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well my daughter is 14 months and can say a few clear words...5 tops. and all gone. he sounds ok to me. just keep encouraging, read stories, picture books with colours opposites, numbers, and read them daily to him. taking him for walks and point out birds, trees , cars, simple words and simple sentences he will eventually copy:)|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter started talking around 15 months.|`|hCsLm2nkaa	mine was at 2 but she is a late one|`|7ldEn0fJaa	when i was 5 months old my first word was da da, but my mom said u could hardly understand|`|KN2nwZk3aa	My son is 21 monthst and has just started to really talk in the last month, most of which makes no sense to me. he mostly says the beginning letter sound. I would not worry to much at all.  I would say my son says about 20 words , barely intelligible and 15 of them he started saying in the last month, ... I would give him until two to be concerned.... Just keep talking to him, singing , reading and playing. he will catch on. Many children learn at their own pace and will work on other areas, like gross and fine motor skills. You are doing nothing wrong I am sure. Is your son engaging in play with you, giving you eye cantact beginning to copy what he sees you doing like wiping the table, vacuuming ect..? Every time he wants up , tell him "up"  or if he needs help say "help". say the names of his foods, milk, friends toys  and repeat often. One day he will just begin to understand that the words are associated to other things... then look out>>>  ;0<br>   good luck<br>   PS I have two older boys 24 nad 23 years and they both took their time to talk.... Boy do they talk now..  Oh yeah crazy ... baby #3 was a huge surprise!!!!
c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Its fine!|`|aYCjy8Neaa	It's ok to drink a little bit of tea everyday. you are allowed a certain amount of caffeine everyday. I drink decaf tea, so that I can drink as much as I want lol. Then I don't have to worry about drinking too much caffeine.|`|ZKm894kfaa	Absolutely, and add some lemon if you would like. I drank it all the time with my son.  Just be sure and get plenty of water as well.  Best of Luck and Congrats.  It will be over before you know if!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	It's okay, but you always want to limit your caffiene intake. It's been linked to miscarriages early in pregnancy and low birth weight.|`|jUyAoQ63aa	its absolutely fine, especially if there is little to no sugar in it. I would just watch the caffiene, but other then that its Perfectly fine, i know people who drink coffee through out the whole pregnancy and nothing is wrong with baby!|`|EPToPwkcaa	yes its absolutely fine only thing you need to be careful of with tea is your caffeine intake|`|FfGHHhqBaa	sure it is, it is good to ask if you don't know tho|`|3tiH3rEZaa	yea its fine|`|zwctZ812aa	Yes, it's fine.  I was very pregnant all summer (fall baby) and drank iced tea pretty much daily.  Maybe a glass or two...not a whole lot, just like you're saying.  My son came out just fine!  You would probably have to drink a gallon or so a day to cause any harm to your baby, so go for it! Oh, and you can sweeten it with sugar if you want, just I would recommend not using the artificial sweeteners as there is still some controversy over whether or not those are safe in pregnancy.  Congrats on the baby!|`|AA10927320	its fine but u might feel ur uterus contracting i know i do everytime i  drink anything herbal
xue72D76aa	I think I like the 3rd one best although I will admit that I don't like any of them overly much.  <br>  <br>  You could buy plain white t-shirts or onesies and do your own iron-on.  You could put a picture of your husband with all three girls (or make an individual one per child) with a slogan of your choice to make it more personal.  If you went that route, you'd probably end up keeping the outfits as mementos which would make for a cool story down the line when the kids are older.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I personally like the Third one.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	The 3rd one!|`|M2yERqNSaa	i think they are all tacky<br>  <br>  make something that comes from the heart|`|8LrnysX8aa	I also like the third one best of those, although I agree with others that something home-made would be even better.  With three children so young, though, I completely understand that you might not have the time.<br>  <br>  The real question, though, is: which do you think your husband would like best?  I think you should go for whichever one that is, even though I can't tell you which one that might be. You know his tastes better than we do!|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	3rd one|`|cWTjEE2Zaa	I like the 3rd one too.. it is cute..|`|ZTRakv6maa	i like the second one|`|lqlfIEjNaa	I thought he was done?<br>  Sorry to hear that.|`|FcHplZtQaa	and again, the 3rd one!|`|ArYvBhkpaa	3 and 4 are my favorites!

YzUPmWTBaa	Yes, my sister in law tested negative on hpts until she was 12wks pregnant! She now has a healthy baby boy :) Try to relax, I know its hard, and keep your mind busy these 2wks. Im sure you are gonna get your bfp then! Please keep in touch and let me know. Good luck!|`|YI31TqNNaa	I'm sure he didn't mean to "pretend" that you are pregnant. Just don't drink, take prenatal vitamins, etc. The bleeding you experienced could have been implantation bleeding, or your period. I would just sit tight for a while. Stressing about it really does no good, and believe me, once you stop worrying about getting pregnant, your body will allow you to become pregnant. And yes, my hpt came out negative even though I was almost 3 months along.|`|h4Ri11Unaa	hi alot off people has not known they were pregnant till about 11 weeks. women are different in everyway when it comes to pregnancy i suggest you wait for a little while i know waiting is the hardest thing i am having to wait to test and its killing me lol but some women do find out there preg later on its just the hcg taking its time to show thats all<br>  <br>  GD luck and tons of baby dust to you.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Having the same problem and it is frustraitng.|`|523t7xWIaa	I was the same way. i came on a period november i had sex a week after i went off. december i spotted. toward the end of december my breast started to itch really bad. by the middle of january i was 11 weeks pregnant. so good luck on that one. most likely you're pregnant it  take a minute to feel the symptoms|`|BMVNuhXiaa	well i did with my first child they tested and testedit was not showing up so i went on thnking i wasnt i got sick one day real bad had to go to hospital and that where they told me i was 4months i did not know i told them my doctor did alot of testing and said to wait so it can happen so dont be alarm about it try not to think about it it waill happen|`|8Gcyr0T1aa	My sister took 19 pregnancy tests, two of them blood tests, over three months.

I feel your pain!!! It's been 50days since my last period!!! hopefully we get our BFP very soon!!!

It is possible that you are.  I am happy to se a physician that realizes not all test are accurate 100% of the time.   Sounds like they gave you good advice.  <br>  <br>  I do not think that they meant to pretend that you are pregnant.  I think what they were saying is not to drink, smoke or do anything that would be bad just in case you are pregnant.  Good luck|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Yes I Have and she just had her baby. I bet you are. Best of luck
1JGj56TFaa	Yes i experienced that as well.  My midwife assured me that it was all my muscles and ligaments stretching and becoming prepared for the delivery.  Good luck x|`|Qd5fQpMYaa	That would be your babies head! I'm 34 weeks and 5 days pregnant. I went to the doctor on Monday with pain so bad down there I thought the baby was going to come out already. He checked and could feel the babies head and said it was normal. I couldn't walk, stand up from sitting, or roll over in bed without the pain going from bad to excruciating.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Unfortunately its totally normal. It also sounds like your baby may have "dropped" to prepare for the "final journey" :)<br>  <br>  Sorry, a few more weeks and you'll have your little bundle and new aches and pains!|`|iFAlZfVMaa	oh boy, does it happen!!  for me it was painful, dr said it was normal....|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Sounds like baby has dropped!! Not too much longer!
veO1RXrCaa	I wasn't aware that you got a option.  I was of the impression that you went vaginally unless there were complications.  The baby will not be born still born bc it hurts,  Suck it up you are going to be Mom.  You are going to hurt worse if you get a section.  I had a teeny tiny incision from having my gall bladder removed and I felt like I was going to die.  I could not imagine a great big one across my belly.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	if you are fully healthy and can have a natural birth do it, i have circumstances where i have to get a c-section and i wish i didnt, even though its less painful the experience of natural birth is something all women should go through..its what we were made for...lol..|`|Q1GuJDuxaa	natural|`|ojtINp2raa	You can have a natural birth with several different pain relievers.  You can have an epidural, or go with the general 'pain reliever' IV/injections.  There are several options.    For me to state my opinion is asking to get flamed...but I'm going to anyway.  I don't believe there is *ever* an excuse for a C-section UNLESS the mother's or baby's life would be in jeopardy without it, such as delivering multiples, narrow vaginal canal, etc.  I don't think "But I have a low pain tolerance" is a good reason.  People have babies every day....even those with low pain tolerance levels, and when it's over you have a beautiful blessing.    No pain, no gain in my opinion.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	your step mom doesnt know what shes talking about. I went natural with all four of mine and going natural doesnt determine whether the baby will be still born. A still born child is usually deceased before labor even begins and if you have any complications then they will do a c section. Other than that they wont do it unless youve already had one or theres a medical reason for them to do it. Also if you get an epidural it will numb you and you wont feel any pain. Your doctor wont do a c section just because you have a low pain tolerance and if you do have a c section you will go through labor pains after the baby is born which is more painful than just having a normal child birth. Good luck and best wishes|`|rR5nIklWaa	okay 1st of all they wont do a c-section on you  unless they have to  like a emergcy  you cant  just say ok i want a csection on sunday  no  you have to go natural  atho they can give u a epidoral  for the pain but of course its going to hurt  i still have no idea how am going to do this eather i hate it when i just get blood drawn|`|myEwHgI1aa	Go natural.|`|YQYMPGK3aa	go natural    moms are cool    step moms are the devil|`|kcrXrntnaa	i would defiantly go natural, because well it's the natural way, i want to feel it, and i wouldn't want those scars. congrats and good luck!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, sweetie you do what feels best for yourself. If you feel you are ready to go through natural labor, than go ahead and try it. If you cant handle pain very well, you can always ask for a epidural or pain Relief drugs like gas or pethidine.    Now i haven't been through natural labor,so i cant tell you how it feels but i can tell you having a c section is painful. I was up and walking the next day after my c section, but the pain hurt a little for the first couple of days. It just depends on your body really. So i think you should do whats best for yourself.No one can make this choice but you. Good luck and congrats    p.s. my scar is 9cms long and is tiny,neat and faded. You cant see it.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	i had an emergency c-section with my daughter and now am going to try natural!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Natural childbirth is not as painful or horrible as so many people insist it is.  Seriously.  I'd personally give it a 6 or 7 out of 10 with 10 being the most pain you could imagine.    I had an epidural with my first and felt like a passive observer (and along with the nubain I was completely woozy and really didn't get too excited when my daughter was born).    With my second I had no pain relief.  You just make sure to stay relaxed and you can cope with the contractions just fine.  Your body is made to do it- there's a special hormonal cycle that goes on during labor that is cut off in a labor with drugs or a c-section.  The culmination of that hormonal cycle at birth results in a flood of endorphins and strengthens that bonding you have with your newborn.  It also speeds up your milk production.    A c-section is major abdominal surgery, and all of the risks of major surgery go along with it.  There's risk of infection, damage to organs or your baby, and scar adhesions for you to deal with with your next pregnancy.      Drugs carry risks and do indeed reach the baby, who is affected by them.  A birth without drugs is best for mother and baby hands down. Depending on your life-view, nature or God-designed, our bodies are perfectly made to go through a natural childbirth, and recover far more quickly than a birth with drugs or a c-section.    Some of the answers are confusing the issue a bit-  a natural birth is a vaginal birth WITHOUT pain relief drugs.  A vaginal birth may have drugs for pain relief, but is not natural.|`|AA11111862	I had a c-section. It was an emergency c section because my sons heart rate went to the 20's . I wanted natural birth but i didnt get a choice. The c section was so hard to heal from. There was so much pain & I couldn't take care of my son the way i needed to. It was painful to stand & sit, lying down was hard because it was impossible to get up without help. My husband had to get up and get the baby every time he cried. I'd recommend natural birth. The healing time for c sections are 6 weeks.|`|DIXhpf5Haa	There are A LOT more risks associated with a c-section than a vaginal birth.  A cesarean is major abdominal surgery, with 6+ weeks of recovery.  It increases your risks to future pregnancy, and there are studies that show that babies born by cesarean are at higher risk for breathing issues such as asthma.  Vaginal birth is painful, that's for sure.  But there are ways to cope with the pain.  I'm an advocate for natural vaginal birth, but as others have pointed out, there are pain medication options as well (which, on a side note, also increase your risks, as well as the baby's).  I highly suggest you read books about vaginal birth, and read other moms experiences before making a decision.  There are a lot of great internet resources as well.  If you decide on a vaginal birth, hire a doula.  Having a doula decreases your risk of most complications, including a cesarean, forceps/vacuum extractor, and episiotomy.    A lot of people on here have stated that it is hard to request a cesarean for non-medical reasons, but unfortunately a lot of drs are all too happy to perform cesareans, medically indicated or otherwise.|`|AA10715284	natural ,c-section you have scars and laid up  more|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	Natural.  Most hospitals don't even consider c-sections unless it is medically necessary.       Your step mother is evil for saying that to you by the way.|`|771ygKJJaa	hi   i think your step mum is talking rubbish!!i would suggest going natural, its much less pain afterwards!having a natural birth is what women are designed to do!there is also great pain relief on offer. a c-section is a scarey experience and after i had it i was unable to stand straight for over 2weeks. the pain of waking after you have been cut open was unbearbale. i have had a natural and c-section and i think natural with pain reilef is defiantly the best option!  good luck and best wishes x|`|f796497cad6fcdd202a39e5b59262df6aa	Ohhh my god,  C-Section all the way!!!   I had a natural birth 8 months ago and am never ever going to go through that pain ever again. I am still physically and mentally scarred by the whole ordeal and need to have surgery  'down there' as its so messed up (sorry for the detail). and will never ever have anything coming out of 'there' ever again (or going in, for that matter) ;o)  I have sworn that IF i ever get pregnant again and thats a big IF... i am so going to have a C-Section for definate!!!!!|`|C1gxGabgaa	I'd go natural.... C-sections if had more den 3 times ... doctors could advise u to not have children anymore.... but consult it with your doctor....|`|06e130192e2caf01ed3367885111666baa	Always go natural!!!!!  Any drug you take effects the baby too.  You will have a very alert baby if you go natural.  I am 23 weeks with my fourth child (we suspect twins) and plan to do a home birth.  I am so excited.  You can do so many things, like walk around, and get in water and stuff if you are not high on some drug.      For the baby, do it natural!!|`|im1pB72Saa	Sometimes you don't have a choice.    I went natural with my oldest 18 hours then HAD to get medication to calm us both down, they pretty much put me to sleep until I got to 8.    Second son I went 15 hours and we both went into distress, heart rates drooped and he couldn't be picked up so we had to do a c-section turns out he presented face first.    So pretty much on both of my sons I suffered 15+ hours only to be given medication in the end. You can't say I didn't' try my damnedest to go all Natural, God just didn't intend for me to do so.    As far as recovery it isn't one way or the other.    My first son because of complications and my epesiodimy, I was in horrible pain for weeks.    The c-section aside from the burning obvious soreness, personally it would have been easy had I not busted my incision (when they say don't lift....don't lift)

39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	I don't think my story will give anyone hope but it lets you know that there are some people who (may) have been ttc much longer than you have. My husband and I have been ttc since we got married in 2000... more than 8 YEARS ago. The only time we used any form of birth control at all was while I took a college course a few years ago. Before I went back to school, we had tests done and didn't really know too much about it at the time and... come to think of it... I don't think the doctor knew too much either because, even though the tests showed back then that I wasn't ovulating, he labelled it inconclusive and assumed that I was. We finally had everything confirmed a couple of years ago and I am now on Clomid to help me ovulate. It's still taking a while. The Clomid is working. We know that. Since my husband was away a lot last year, we didn't try in consecutive months. I got another 6 month refill and have gone through 3 more... so that's 9 cycles with Clomid now and no baby. It seems as though everyone around me is pregnant. Even my sister, who had an unplanned child only 6 months ago, revealed that she is already a couple of months along with her second! I don't know what I'm going to do once my next 3 rounds of Clomid run out. I'm 34 now. Hubby's 37. Don't give up, sweetie! =)|`|9gHVoof2aa	*****baby dust to you******* try not to get too stressed out i had been trying for 3 months and i became all stressed because i wasnt pregnant and i just thought whats the point it will happen iv just gotta enjoy trying and thats what i did i didnt worry about when i was ovulating or anything like that and sure enough the following month i was pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl on the 17th of january xx|`|rmse6Mj8aa	kirsty b is right and congrats kirsty b by the way on your beautiful girl!    try to keep your perspective - it is easy to get obsessed.     it is normal for it to take some time - within a year is normal. relax. you will get there. read up and educate yourself babyhopes.com is great - ther more you know the more you will realise that it will happen when the time is right.     good luck and baby dust to you . hugs .. x|`|2FpRjoQKaa	Baby dust to you too!

I cant take the monthly emotional pain.|`|7BqMjQHAaa	YOU ARE NOT ALONE!! I have been TTC since May of 08. It has been awful. There has been so so many problems. Resulting in me having to have a D&C done in January. So a week after the d&c I started to track my ovulation. I bought PreSeed...and also Femaprin. Femaprin is a all natural pill that helps regulate your cycles. I started using that Femaprin and I swear to you 3 days later I started to ovulate. So we used the preseed. And now we are just waiting. I am not expecting anything because we have been trying. But at least you know that you arent alone. I am going crazy trying to figure out different things to try just to help. The only thing I am NOT doing is getting stressed out and depressed over it. It will happen. And I know in my heart it will. I am just going to try and help it along in any way that I can. Good Luck to you!!!!!!! Relax and know you arent alone. It will happen.

OBU1eDUHaa	I am sooooooooo there with you.  My son was two in Feb and my daughter is 3 months old.  He is testing you, trying to get your attention.  I was nursing my daughter about a month ago and when I finished I looked up to see that my son had opened the stove (even though it has  a lock on it) had all his play food in there, was on top of the counter trying to put the metal knifes in the microwave!  You are doing everything right.  Sometimes I just have to put the baby down and spend a couple of minutes with just him, whether the baby is crying or not.  Good luck!|`|aYCjy8Neaa	He's just reached the terrible two's and then you have him feeling left out on top of it. My son is 22 months and I am pregnant and he's already doing the same things your son is doing. He dosn't always listen the best, and I assume this will only get worse once baby is here. It will get better though, just let him know that it's not ok. And when he throws tantrums just ignore him.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	I am 7 mos. pregnant and currently have a 20 month old.

Not that you aren't already giving him attention but you are understandably preoccupied with your new babies (as you need to be.)<br>  <br>  Maybe once you put the babies to bed you can stay up an extra half hour with your son and give him some pre-bedtime mommy time, something quiet and relaxing that will get him ready to sleep, like laying in bed and reading a story.<br>  <br>  I would have been pretty annoyed with the peeing in the bassinet thing, though. That's a mess...|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Hes trying to get your attention. That and the terrible twos are almost here and they are terrible lol.

3EhoJ42zaa	Yes it is normal.  Baby is so big right now and has zero room.  The shooting pain could be round ligament pain from baby lowering into position.  You will have this pain until baby is delivered.<br>  <br>  <br>  If that cramping starts to come in a consistent pattern, start to become more intense, or you cannot talk through it, then you may want to start getting your things together to go.  You'll know when your in active labor.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Sounds like the baby is engaged and you feel his head moving...yeah, I think it is normal.Is this your first baby?

Z2m8TEFHaa	Hope it goes well for both of you. My girlfriend had to be induced and it's nothing to worry about.

Good luck :)|`|jQDeTTVhaa	wow you were due on the 21st.I was due on the 29 and I am also getting induced on Friday.What are you having?

I went in to the hospital, and walked around a bit to try to get some contractions going, but it just wasn't happening. They inserted cervidil, which looks like a tampon, and I was to stay in bed all night with that in ( I was allowed to get up and pee, which I had to do like every 5 minutes) Well, in the morning, they had to take it out, but it took three nurses to do that because they wrapped the string all the way around. That hurt so bad. :( Anyway, they started the pictocin in the morning, and I began to feel contractions ( they felt like menstrual cramps from hell) At 3 cms they artificially broke my water with a big hook. Then the contractions really took off, and I was begging for an epidural. Well, I got my epi and it was sooo good, I could not feel anything! ( By the way, with an epi they insert a catheter so you can not get out of bed for any reason now) I dialated to ten fairly quickly then, but when I was fully dialated, I had no urge to push. I tried to push for 2 hours, and then ended up in a C-section. All that work, just to have my little bundle taken away....I did not get to hold my son for several hours after that. It was a heartbreak for me, the whole situation. It seemed to be one intervention after another!   So, that is my experience with induction.|`|jXZeoPAwaa	i was induced with my son at 36 weeks and everything was absolutly fine although i was abit sore as my body wasnt ready for labour but as i sadi everything went swimming, hope all goes well and your have your baby in your arms soon.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I don't have any advice really, mostly I just want to say good luck :) Also, I did have a friend say that being induced was the best thing in the world because you KNOW that your baby will be coming approximately within the next 2-3 days, rather than waiting for labour to come on naturally. I don't know if that's true, but it might help you to stress less :)|`|771ygKJJaa	hi   i was induced to have my son 5months ago.  i had to be induced twice(they pushes a small tablet upto my cervix-it was painless).the first time didnt work then 12 hours later they induced me again and 5 hours later my waters broke. i was put onto a drip to speed up my labour and after 7 hours of labour i had a c-section as my babys heart was going slow and i wasnt very far dilated. i will be honest i did find the start of labour extreamly painful as when you are induced your cervix is forced to dilate. but its not scarey and just think u wont be leaving the hospital without a baby however your birth turns out!  lots of luck to you and your baby X|`|dpPqH7BAaa	Being induced can be scary and very hard on your body. I recommend you try alternative options first to try and induce naturally. Drink some "Red Raspberry Leaf" tea, this helps strengthen the uterine walls. Also, nipple stimulation works great!! It causes your body to make oxytocin which causes the uterus to contract. Sex always helps ripen the cervix, so does primrose oil! Even taking long hot baths helps soften the cervix.     Try the nipple stimulation in the bathtub, then sex, then maybe eat some fresh pineapple. If this doesn't work, then at least you had fun in the process, but it may help your labor along naturally, which is easier on your body.
AA11065140	To be completely honest, the words, "Oh, son, trust me, you'll know it when I hit you" come to mind right away...but that's probably not the right response.<br>  <br>  Perhaps CPS (or Dr. Phil?) could recommend a video for him to watch, to see what hitting and abuse really looks like.  Alternately, you might use dolls or stuffed animals to express the difference, much like doctors and lawyers use with children in similar situations.  You could allow the dolls to role play through a situation like what happens at home, as well as another that's more indicative of abuse.  If he can understand the difference (challenging at his age, really), he'll know that life is good where he's at.<br>  <br>  I have to wonder, though, where he's getting the information that there is such a thing as abuse.  Is his mother prompting this?  Is there a school mate who has gone through this?  A 9-year old shouldn't know that abuse exists...finding the source of his "information" might help you eliminate the problem from the ground up.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Yep, it sounds as if he has bogus info inside his head, and it would do him good to truly understand the difference.  Additionally, if he still has contact with his bio-mom, you might want to be certain that she's not discussing this topic with him.  Really, unless she has a legitimate concern (i.e., she sees hand-shaped bruises on him), this is a subject that should be discussed amongst adults.  A 9-year old really doesn't have the life experiences to fully understand the implications.<br>  <br>  If you have the ability to do so, it wouldn't hurt to see a counselor - either on his own, or with the family.  Sometimes, the professionals have a better way to get kids to understand than we parents can.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Talk to CPS. Especially if they've already been there. They know to look out for abuse, they might jsut be able to help you out with clarifying it for your kid. Probably cheaper than a psychologist (but probably slightly less effective)|`|CgHHA2u0aa	maybe he could have seen something on tv or heard about abuse and wants attention, but if I was you it does not hurt to investigate or see a psychologist  but do not ignore the incident or what he is going through|`|tBx1M0g9aa	you need to explain to him and be as nice and kindl as you can...don't touch him if you get mad just send him to his room ....|`|0kXlNWcMaa	he probably thinks this way because his mother used to abuse him. You need to talk to him and let him know that you love him and would never hurt him.|`|zRdhSYO1aa	You should take him to a therapist. It can only help.|`|IFHzCyOkaa	well it sounds to me like he's spoiled and if he doesn't get his way he takes it out of hand.<br>  set him straight and tell him why he's lying and explain to him the difference between abuse and what you guys are doing.<br>  demonstrate if you have to...<br>  theres something wrong with that kid maybe you should get help?|`|LAsYy7C8aa	Either his mother abused him or there is a friend at school or elsewhere that is going through it.  <br>  When I was little my cousin touched me inappropriately...and we soon found out that she did it because she had a friend that had had it done to her.  That kind of abuse could work like that too.  Sit down and talk, talk to the school and get him some help.|`|fGMmSOxAaa	Through the custody battle he likely got some fine lessons in how to lie and manipulate people.  He is quite willing to use this knowledge to his advantage, to scare you out of controlling his behaviour.  Also, if he has been abused in the past (but perhaps he has not) he may use that knowledge.  If he has never been abused by you or his dad, and has not been abused by his mother he is likely doing this to control you.  A session with CPS could be a crap shoot as I find some social workers very badly educated and of very poor judgement.  A family therapy session, if you really are worried about this, would likely be better.  You should react firmly to his nonsense and tell him "You had a choice to go to your room yourself.  You have caused this situation. I am not using any unreasonable force."  Remind him that he was asked politely the first time and then didn't comply.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	What a difficult situation. But it seems that he is turning it into his advantage. Keep  up or request regular help from the CPS yourselves and ask their advice on how best to handle this problem.|`|CxCigxZIaa	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooo it's his age. I will almost guarantee you that in SCHOOL they learn about abuse (usually from a speaker from outside the school). Now ALSO he might be hearing this from one of his friends at school...it's quite possible that there's another child in his class that is doing this. (and he's copying).<br>  Now MY son is A DRAMA KING and I can push him along to go out the door and he acts like I've literally shoved him out the door...oh yes..stumbling and all. IF this is similar to your son (step son's) behavior I truly feel it's the AGE and what he's watching on TV! YES TV! <br>  Do this...watch some of the cartoons or shows he is watching and you'll see what I mean.<br>  At first I thought it was funny that he was such a good 'actor' because we actually do not believe in spanking. (he's had a few though..) anyway, ask him. Ask him WHY would he say that? Let him know it's hurtful and uncalled for. He's 9 and he'll understand.<br>  Final note: if the mother is still involved .. it's possible that 'she' is the cause of allot of this. Monitor that if you can.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	He needs professional help.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	sounds like the boy is either looking for attention or needs some major therapy!|`|a7c6ee8570b7aa608580bef0382bd952aa	He needs some counseling if he thinks abuse is around every corner. My son once accused me of abuse and I didn't know what to do either so I sent him to counseling it did a world of good for him. He is grown now but the counselor explained to him what it was to be abused. Maybe you can explain it to him. When we want you to behave we mean it. Ask him do we punch, beat, kick, burn, starve, keep you in a closet? Let him think about it before answering you. Tell him that is abuse! A swat on the bottom isn't abuse, it is what it is, a way to get your childs attention. It isn't against the law but frowned upon by society. I wish you all the luck and good vibrations in the world on this matter and will keep my fingers crossed for you.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	my son can be like that with my husband (his stepfather since he was 4) - sounds like the same story. without the Children's services though. i'm thinking he likes the attention, he's a "drama queen" and can't control his emotions very well. it's also a control thing - "i'll do it when i want, the way i want to do it or i'll scream abuse". i've gotten to the point where he has said "i'll call the cops" (about my husband who merely escorted him to his room) and i will say "good, actually let me call them for you". and he usually asks me not to.<br>  <br>  the bottom line is you guys need family counseling. good luck.
fRX6sSdTaa	It al depends...<br>  This could mean that he likes you and was too shy to so anything about it other than this, or he could think your a good friend.<br>   on his myspace comment on the pic like "i like your pic" or something.  That might make him say something.<br>  Sorry, I can't help more.|`|bS7DN85Qaa	Yeah, he's trying to make his ex jealous.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Sounds like he wants the other girl to be jealous|`|r8jHotgwaa	I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I think he might be trying to make the other girl jealous. By having a picture of him and another girl, he might think that his previous girlfriend would be mad and want him back. I'm really sorry that it could be true, but it could go a completely different way as well. He might like, but guys are unpredictable. Good Luck!!|`|I64JOuMKaa	he might've posted that picture to get his ex girlfriend jealous.<br>  If he hasn't talked to you in a long time chances are he just used that picture to show people he's over her and to make her jealous.<br>  <br>  Unless he starts talking to you a lot, there also might be a small chance he's always had feelings for you . Who knows ! Start talking to him again and see where it leads.
9OsjdsrZaa	There are a lot of things that it could be.  I am not a Dr., just an informed mom, so don't take my word on it.  <br>  <br>  It could be RSV, but the symptoms do not come and go like your daughters.<br>  <br>  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children. RSV causes infection of the lungs and breathing passages. In adults, it may only produce symptoms of a common cold, such as a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, mild headache, cough, fever, and a general feeling of being ill. But RSV infections can lead to other more serious illnesses in premature babies and kids with diseases that affect the lungs, heart, or immune system.<br>  <br>  I would lean more towards something like Whooping cough.  I know a lot of cases have turned up recently.  Here are some of the Signs and Symptoms:<br>  <br>  The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a common cold:<br>  <br>      * runny nose<br>      * sneezing<br>      * mild cough<br>      * low-grade fever<br>  <br>  After about 1 to 2 weeks, the dry, irritating cough evolves into coughing spells. During a coughing spell, which can last for more than a minute, the child may turn red or purple. At the end of a spell, the child may make a characteristic whooping sound when breathing in or may vomit. Between spells, the child usually feels well.<br>  <br>  Another thing it might be is TB.  A simple test can determine if it is.  Some symptoms that sound similar to your daughters are:<br>  Another type of infection is called reactivation tuberculosis. Here, the primary infection has resolved, but the bacteria are dormant, or hibernating. When conditions become favorable (for instance, a lowered immunity), the bacteria become active. Tuberculosis in older kids and adults may be of this type. The most prominent symptom is a persistent fever, with sweating during the night. Fatigue and weight loss may follow. If the disease progresses and cavities form in the lungs, the person may experience coughing and the production of saliva, mucus, or phlegm that may contain blood.<br>  <br>  Check out this web site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/</a><br>  <br>  and look under lung and respitory infections.  It could lead you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Best of  Luck!|`|fdWIP0Yiaa	sounds like asthma to me.  Common symptom is coughing, worse @ night. A 3 yo is too little to be able to properly use an inhaler, should be given a nebulizer.  Probably needs pulmicort twice a day and albuterol as needed.  It has worked wonders for my daughter who had basically the exact same symptoms as yours. A chest x ray will not show asthma, may need pulmonary function test, but usually diagnosis is on symptoms  It is much better to do the treatments daily than deal with the horrible coughing episodes.  Good luck|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Sounds like it could be RSV! Have her checked for that just in case. Can be very serious & very contagious. Need medical help to rid of it. Common in babies, toddlers, young kids.
iFAlZfVMaa	i got more of the lansinoh i used when nursing... i figured if it didn't bother her then, it won't bother her now!! I just used a VERY little bit...|`|dPmK83UYaa	maybe you can try to use an all natural kind of lotion that doesn't have too much chemicals. like what they use for kids w/ sensitive skin. don't worry too much about him eating it though, how many times do we girls put lipstick or lipgloss or even chapstick and it ends up in our own bodies?<br>  <br>  There is also that stuff mommies use on their breast when breastfeeding that is not harmful to eat. This is good stuff! I think it is called LAnisoh?
WPI0Z47saa	My son did and so did all 5 of his cousins. It is normal. Just frustrating.|`|zLVZyfwUaa	My daughter was the same way.  I found going to her room and sitting in the rocker and dimming the lights or closing the shades worked.|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	My baby was until I took everything away. She sits in her high chair and it has toys attached and I remove everything and now she eats without distractions. Try putting him in a high chair.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I think every baby does, just imagine how new and interesting everything is...who has time to eat :)|`|IHDVQs3kaa	That's pretty normal.
lZiwWAjkaa	For the most part my son looks like me, but he did take on several features of his daddy which I find quite hilarious...<br>  <br>  --he got his little hairy patch just above the butt crack lol<br>  <br>  --he got his thumb that does not bend at all!! I have a crazy hitchhikers thumb and I am thankful he did not get this.<br>  <br>  --he got my husbands toes and finger nails. Very cute and beautifully shaped.<br>  <br>  --and the funniest thing of all is that he got an eyebrow from each of us!!<br>  This probably doesn't make sense since most eyebrows look the same, but unfortunatley not lol.  Mine brush downward and my husbands go normally to the side.  Well baby D got one of each lol.|`|CIBtfxEqaa	My daughter has my mouth, and my smile, but that's about it. The rest is a carbon copy of her daddy.<br>  <br>  I thought that might be a little strange, a little girl, looking more like her daddy than her mommy. But she's the cutest thing, if I do say so myself. The first thing people tell me is, "She looks so much like her daddy!" Then I hear, "Does that bother you?" Why would that bother me? That's her DAD. Maybe they think it will bother me because I did all the work for 10 months and 39 hours of labor! :)|`|OdGHnebPaa	Oh my goodness!<br>  My son looks like a miniature version of me.<br>  The only features we've been able to attribute to his father are his ears & overall size. He has MASSIVE hands & feet & it makes sense because his father is 6'4" & 280lbs.<br>  But honestly, everyone looks at us & he looks identical to me. My eyes, nose, lips, face shape, hair color. He even makes the same faces I do when he's dissatisfied or upset!<br>  He is very much my child.<br>  hahaha|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	My hgusband and I both have brown hair and eyes. By son has light brown hair and bue eyes. He looks like the boy version of my mother who has blond hair and blue eyes.<br>  Otherwise he has my nose and ears and his fathers lips.|`|2ea454f14c290db182286955535ad373aa	My daughter looks JUST like me and my son looks like his dad.|`|kulDK5jsaa	looks more like a corpse actually|`|EZQIOIxxaa	everyone says my son looks just like his dad but I honestly don't see it.|`|zwctZ812aa	My son is my boyfriend's "mini-me"  It is so hilarious to look at them together.  He is just under 4 months and not only does he look just like him, but he has all of his facial expressions down and just seems to have the same overall attitude.  I get kind of sad sometimes that he doesn't look anything like me, but then again, I gave birth to him, I don't need any reassurance that he's my son! lol|`|2N6KEoVqaa	Ayden looks just like his daddy. Almost a complete carbon copy. He has my lips though.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I have two daughters, one from a previous relationship and one from my husband. They both look exactly alike as babies even though they have different dads. Their dads are also different ethnicities so its even more weird (first daughter's father is white and new hubby is puerto rican) So all in all, I guess that means they look like me!|`|sMukgX7Xaa	It's kinda funny but my son, Tomas looks just like me when I was a baby...you could mix up the pictures it's so close...my complexion, hair, everything<br>  <br>  My daughter, Rylee looks just like her dad when he was a baby...dead on him...his complexion (he's asian), his hair, eyes, nose, everything.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Mia looks like me mostly but she does definitely have a look of her dad. She has my face and his hair and skin. It seems to change everyday though, some days i can really see myself, other days i can see Luke in her...|`|V8wUAVdyaa	noah looks like his daddy mostly.  he has my lips though|`|TrBoPj92aa	My oldest is like a mirrage image of me thank godness as i split up from her dad and would hate to constantly see parts of him in her<br>  <br>  Aimee is 50% 50% its quite scary, she has my eyes, my hair my fiances lips and smile and half of our noses its really cute, some days my mum tells me that Aimee looks exactly like me then some days Craigs parents are convinced she is an identical look a like to him!<br>  <br>  then Sophie looks like my fiance identical in some ways! its quite scary!!|`|Q7jMH5praa	Everyone says my son looks like me. I don't see it though. My son has my husband's nose and hair color, not sure about the texture of his hair yet or his eyes. I hope he does get his daddy's curly hair and his daddy's crystal blue eyes. He has my lips and frown. I've heard that boys tend to look more like their moms and girls look like the dad.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son came out looking like his daddy and still does today at almost 9 months old. Except for the brown hair/eyes he has now. When he was born he had grayish/blueish eyes and jet black hair( just like me when I was born but mine was curly). The brown hair and eyes is from me. But he is totally his dad. Acts just like him too.|`|os36Q3P2aa	hiya <br>  <br>   the 3 boys are the image of their daddy  and my girl is the image of me  when i was a kid! people always comment on how all of our kids look so much like each other aswell  but i personally cant see it  in all of them just the youngest 2 !|`|TWCskV2aaa	i have a mini me...it is almost scary how much my daughter looks like me. i have hazel eyes but she has blue....only thing she got from daddy.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Most people say my son looks like his dad.<br>  I don really think he looks like either of us just yet,|`|4iXL4C6paa	two look like me more, and two look like him|`|baI5G8yLaa	Oh my partner defo! he is like a mini clone of his daddy<br>  <br>  I fact im worried he's not mine LMAO!!! he has nothing of me in him what so ever :(
EeAAjOw3aa	well i like the name kayla the best<br>  and here are the meanings of the names if you want to know<br>  Isabelle means God's promise and God is my oath<br>  Cassidy means curly-headed<br>  Kayla means pure|`|Sob4zaUSaa	Isabel is my all time FAVORITE name!! I absolutely love that name and when I have kids my first daughter is going to be Isabel! But I don't really like the spelling of Isabelle, though that's up to you. My second favorite is Kayla, and Cassidy is okay, but it's my least favorite of the three.<br>  <br>  :)|`|OP7qfOrBaa	i love the names Kayla & Isabelle, not to sure on Cassidy.|`|ceQfqvaXaa	I would say Kayla, but it is always your choice. You are the mother, anyways. :)|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	How about 2 of them.... Cassidy Isabelle has a nice ring-tone to it|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Isabelle|`|BOJEbnCtaa	i like Isabelle and Kayla best|`|02E66ClWaa	Isabelle.<br>  Though i prefer the spelling Isabel because Isabelle looks too much Isabella which I dislike.|`|y9TVkzQYaa	my first choice would be Cassidy<br>  Then Isabella <br>  and lastly Kayla<br>  <br>  So...Cassidy!!!|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	All of them are really pretty. Isabelle is my favorite from my list.|`|nAXmkl3Zaa	Isabelle!!! there all really cute but that's my favorite!|`|4WlkDzLeaa	I adore the name Cassidy!<br>  <br>  So original and feminine. I wrote a story with the lead being Cassidy, so I would definitely recommend that name!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, all three are still pretty!<br>   :)|`|h9J8XWF7aa	I't's between Isabelle and Cassidy. I'd go for Cassidy.|`|nQwSlue1aa	1. Kayla<br>  2. Cassidy<br>  3. Isabelle|`|gzQIstDFaa	i actually like all of those <br>  <br>  but most of all i guess i like cassidy|`|25mfL9UXaa	I vote Isabelle. Sounds more feminine than any of the others!|`|hUbNKOTsaa	Cassidy|`|m3rsLUgDaa	Kayla|`|w3ob12X6aa	i like kayla
xEXb96UKaa	it's perfectly safe. any viruses or bacteria that are in the mucus will be killed by the stomach acid. even when you don't have a cold the fluid from the nose is constantly draining excess fluid down the back of your nose into the throat and into the stomach, though you don't notice it happening.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	no it wont harm your baby it is fine|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Its mucus, its not anywhere near the baby.|`|ZtGThw01aa	I would blow your nose frequently, and call your physician if it gets worse. It is why the position is there for us, to help you through these issues while pregnant. Maybe you can call the nurse and they can give you a a solution over the phone.You do not want it to get so bad that it effects your pregnancy. Take care, :)|`|9gHVoof2aa	no your baby is fine dont worry about that|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Youre fine, the baby is fine. The mucous can't get anywhere near the baby.|`|gssmVH4Haa	Its mucus, It cant harm your baby at all!  Try not to worry so much about natural things.  Your baby is extremely tiny at the moment and you've got another 26 weeks to go, so try not worrying about silly little things or you'll be a reck towards the end of your pregnancy. Just enjoy it! Its a blessing not an illness|`|VEEbzc4jaa	ha ha ha. Bless you    Definetely wont harm the baby hun, how can it??? Very well protected in its little sac of water. Like the last person sed dont panic about the silly little things like that.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Carry extra tissue with you and try sleeping on your side or your tummy to keep from swallowing during the night. As far as spitting in the street, you do what you got to do.
um29wkUPaa	Any time you have unprotected sex you risk pregnancy (or STD).  You're young, and I can tell without asking.  Somewhere in the 12-14 range, or no one has ever sat you down for a talk.  You shouldn't be playing with dynamite if you're not prepared for a blast.  Your whole life can change in a blink by entering territory you're not prepared for.  There's more to sex than getting your rocks off, get educated before acting.    Can you imagine marrying this girl?  Can you imagine quitting school and getting a full time job? Can you picture yourself having to drop sports teams and activities?  No time for friends either.  Things like turning 16, 18 and 21 celebrations - you can forget about them.  Any one/number of these things will happen if you don't know what you're doing.  These aren't exaggerations.  Don't do this again until you know what you're doing and how to do it safety.      I can totally understand if you don't want to talk to your parents.  Talk to a teacher, a friend's mother (or father), an uncle.  There are options.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	If there was semen on your penis, yes, there is a chance.  As for a percentage, that's impossible to give you.    Yes, anyone can buy pregnancy tests at any age.  Also, any one of any age can buy CONTRACEPTIVES.|`|77NzfiVkaa	It's always possible when you have sex. Even with protection.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Yes.  Know what they call girls who use that sort of birth control?  Mothers.     One sperm. One egg.One baby.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	Yes, as other have said    You can easily buy a test at a chemist or supermarket no matter what age you are|`|X2lWYZARaa	yes she can get pregnant from the way you had sex  so congrats your probably going to b a daddy   if shes not pregnant maybe you should keep it in your pants until you learn enough about sex to know what you are doing|`|d5ec0d14b20f77a346c8dcc04807a042aa	yes|`|IRH71dwIaa	YES! and Yes. There is a thing called  pre-ejaculation which occurs during intercourse and still contains sperm. So although you used the withdrawal method you still could get her pregnant.    You can also buy pregnancy tests at any drug store regardless of your age.    Here's a link for some information:  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/birth-c...|`|fjkRIUSnaa	yes you should have wore a condom|`|X6RwSrJjaa	Anytime you have intercourse, there is a chance the chick will get pregnant. Condoms have the highest chance with a .01% of pregnancy. Do not freak out tho, if you did not blow in her.. you will be fine. The odds are so low that its not worth the stress. Just wait and see. No need to freak out, and if you smoke cannibis, your chances are even slimmer for getting her pregnant... tho if you were to, there is a higher chance for the kid to have birth defects. Do not worry about it. And preg tests are not even reliable until a couple weeks after ferlization. Do not let these people scare you|`|R8yelFG7aa	Anytime there is semen near a vagina pregnancy is possible.  Sperm outside the body only survives about an hour, but it can survive longer so long as it remains suspended in wet semen.      The morning after pill is a dose of higher than normal birth control hormones.  It can do three things- delay ovulation, prevent ovulation, cause the uteran lining to change so that the zygote cannot implant.  This means it can be effective in preventing pregnancy, but like all contraceptive, nothing is 100%.  The morning after pill is really only helpful within 72 hours from the time you had sex.      If you aren't ready to be a parent, I'd suggest using condoms or at least some sort of spermicidal foam or gel.  Believe me... sexual relationships can be complicated enough without the worry of pregnancy scares.  And she'll appreciate the consideration.  Being willing to protect the both of you is a good thing to do for your girlfriend.    Just found a new website that gives other information on "the morning after pill".  You should check it out, here's the link:    http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...|`|v7Xvow4Daa	Go and buy some condoms!!    Also you will have to wait 14 days until after sex to use a pregnancy test and get the right result

dpPqH7BAaa	Sometimes the baby goes into heavy sleep modes. The best thing to do to wake them up is to have a contrast in their environment. Try moving around a lot, then lie on your left side, and drink some ice cold orange juice. Wait a few minutes, the baby should wake right up. The cold juice sends a sensation to the uterus, and the sugar in the juice gives them a quick burst of energy and change in their blood sugar. If you are dehydrated, make sure you drink ice cold water. This alone could wake the baby. If all else fails, just rest and relax, babies mainly fall asleep when you move a lot because it rocks them to sleep. Your lack of movement may help.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	She is getting big now - maybe she just has less room to move about. This is normal at this point. If you go all day(24 hours) without detecting any movement, you should go to the hospital.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's completely normal not to feel your baby move every day this early in pregnancy even though it's scary when they don't. You can try drinking orange juice, that usually will wake them up.|`|gssmVH4Haa	Don't worry, its completely normal not to have regular movements at that stage.   Doctors and midwifes only seem to be worried if your over 28 weeks and notice a change in movements.  Your baby could well be in a different position, perhaps closer to your back which is why you haven't felt her.  When I was 24 weeks, I experienced something similar, I hadn't felt him move for about a day and a half and I was really worried so I went up to the hospital where they reassured me that its completely normal and to only worry if you get any pain,bleeding or fluid loss. If you haven't felt her move by tonight or tomorrow morning then perhaps go to your local hospital where they should listen to her heartbeat to reassure you and put your mind at rest.  Try not to worry though, Decreased movement is normal at this stage.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	try drinking something sweet and laying on your left side, but remember babies do have lazy days, but if you still haven't felt her later give the hospital a quick ring|`|AA10529334	Call your doctor and ask him/her..

Stimulate your mind and stay healthy.|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Chilled out! Just my usual daily routine, chores! You should just make the most of your time before baby arrives, (I know it sounds awful as if your world is about to fall apart). But really you dont get much time to yourself afterwards. Go to watch a film, go on holiday, just make a list of things you wont get to do for a while when baby is here, and then go and do it. As much as you will enjoy your baby, you still need to enjoy yourself now.|`|dpPqH7BAaa	I have been getting the nursery ready for months now. I even have her first change of clothes set out! I also have all of my birthing supplies on a table in her room so I'm all set to go. I also do light housework (dishes, laundry, and dusting). However the main thing I do during the day is alternate between sleeping and doing a slight workout. I basically turn on a long, upbeat song, and make myself move to the whole thing. That way it's not too strenuous, but at least I'm getting some exercise.|`|X1ACfL8eaa	Wow I am 30 weeks and moving this week too!

rdpZrBc9aa	Take another test tomorrow with your first morning urine.  You might want to consider another form of birth control, like an IUD.  They don't usually use them for young women your age, but you have special circumstances.  It can always be removed when you decide you want a child.|`|mKUMsE5jaa	No your not pregnant hun...  Stress and Depression can mess up your period in all sorts of ways...  Its probably because your stressed our or depressed...  You need to relax.  Your next period should be normal then.  Hope my answer helped you out, i have a cousin that went through the same thing.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I don't think you're pregnant. Good luck!|`|akB0gV20aa	He is probably right, it should show up if you take it after you miss your period.  And the fact that your period showed up, even if its light, makes the chances even slimmer.  It may just be a fluke hormonal thing...<br>  Good Luck!
tRcO5uyiaa	Ooo.... tough one. If a child doesn't like you (at whatever level you want them to) chances are, it ain't gonna happen until the child decides to like YOU. I'm not sure why it would be so important to you for her to like you at the SAME intensity as you do for her. It shouldn't matter. Children are very unpredictable and fickle. They will go through a trillion changes before their own character is established. Just be yourself around her. She'll come around eventually.|`|Zjtdpbqpaa	Give it some wonka bars and everlasting jawbreakers!|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Candy or a favorite toy|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Play with her.|`|u5DKcgwmaa	Well I'm sure bribes work but two year old's are in their own world. They prefer a toy to a person a lot of the time.|`|A6JQScr6aa	it will just take time|`|atmDaT61aa	Play with her, make silly faces, noises, get a sock puppet whatever just make her laugh and she'll want you to keep doing it|`|qayCggxMaa	Blow bubbles (the kind you buy at the store) around her.
PZjTc0geaa	I had a full period after mine was removed. I think it was like 9 days or so.
4cehW3S9aa	I was on a 28 day cycle.<br>  <br>  Generally, 14 to 17 days from the start of your last period.  However, you can get the ovulation predictor kits from any drug store.<br>  <br>  All I can say, is don't try too hard.  My husband and I quit trying and the following month I was pregnant.  We tried for 5 months before saying enough and now I am due in August. :)|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Go to this web site <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calculator." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calc...</a>|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Get an ovulation test kit from the store. They're by the condoms. Also my doctor told me to look for an egg white discharge to indicate when you're ovulating.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Ovulation calculators are good but you may also want to try an ovulation prediction kit. They work the same as a home pregnancy test but tell you the best days to do the baby dance ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EPToPwkcaa	tyr the ovulation test i heard they are really good my friend got pregnant in first month of trying it. good luck
jaT35u4oaa	You would be surprised at how differently some children act when their parents aren't around. For all you know, she might be a perfect little angel for her daycare teachers. <br>  <br>  If you are comfortable with the daycare, and have been happy with the care your son had previously, I am sure that the staff is able and competent enough to handle any trouble that your daughter may cause. Daycare workers ( especially in the toddler room) are used to all sorts of behaviours, so I wouldn't stress about your daughter causing them trouble. :)|`|lzcglDnMaa	Well everytime she throws a fit or doesn't share, she will be put in time out. I would suggest taking her there and letting her play with the kids a few times before you just drop her off. Since you had your son there and he was ok then your daughter should be too. She might get angry at first and throw fits, but when she does, just leave her. The daycare employees know how to handle kids like this. They will help her get adjusted.  If she is going to be there for nap time, make sure that she has something from home to sleep with. This helps her feel more comfortable in unknown surroundings. Good luck to you.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	take her there a few times for a visit to expose her to the surroundings!
lGcpXteaaa	My 3 month old did that but she was definitely not teething.<br>  Everybody said she was teething but she actually didnt start teething until she turned 7 months.<br>  <br>  I found that at 3 months they discover their hands so they automatically go in the mouth and your baby's salivary glands have started to work so therefore she drools alot!<br>  <br>  Hope that helped x|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, teething is a process.  My son drooled and had his hands in his mouth for about two months before teeth actually appeared.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	My daughter had both or her 2 bottom teeth at 3months old...no one believed me that she was teething and sure enough her 2 little teeth popped through! lol....its very normal, in fact some babies are born with a tooth.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	Yes. It's very possible. My daughter had 2 teeth the day of her 4 month appt. One was already through the gums and the other was there the next day. Good luck. Instead of baby orajel, I recommend teething tablets. They sell them at places like Target, Walmart and probably grocery stores. You may have to check in the pharmacy but they may be with the orajel too. They work well and they dissolve in their mouths and don't taste bad. They are also all natural so they are better for them.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	It's very normal for 3 month olds to have their hands in their mouths.  They're just discovering their bodies, and part of that is putting their hands in their mouths, so it might have nothing to do with teething. <br>  <br>  It's pretty normal for the teething process to start around 3 months.  My son started showing signs around then, but the first tooth didn't pop out til 6 months!|`|2N6KEoVqaa	My son started that at like 3 months and 1 week or so. He is 4 1/2 months and no teeth yet!! I think it is normal though, and I would definitely guess that she is teething.
ZaadvJAXaa	This has probably happened because your corneas have changed shape.  Enjoy it while it lasts!  It probably won't be the same after the baby arrives.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Interesting!  My problem is the opposite, I can barely see (well I exaggerate) but my vision is definitely not great right now, even with a fairly new rx.  I guess you're just lucky :)|`|TrBoPj92aa	wow thats great, i found that my eyes got worse and were always tired, lucky you, luckily they have gone back to normal though hope that dosen't happen for you x|`|C0tucwv1aa	while your pregnant your eyes change alittle bit mine went the other way around mine got worse

GuzZdOEWaa	Honestly, I feel bad for her. I don't think she fully comprehends what she has gotten herself into. She went from being a nobody to a overnight celebrity and getting death threats. Sadly, the only ones who are going to suffer are the children.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Its not our business...until she announced she will be getting on welfare and things like that so basically WE are paying for her children.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	It is none of anyone's business. perhaps our tax money is going to end up paying for her family but guess what?! our tax money pays for alot more than just her family. quitt being a pain in the ***, your ranting is not going to change the fact.|`|omtn7gJmaa	I feel like it was really selfish of her. She has 6 kids and now she is going to have 8 more. There is no way she can take care of all those kids. It isn't fair to her children and the children she is about to have and everyone else. There are enough problems in our economy, and she is bringing more people into the world who have to live through this crisis. I think it's really irresponsible. I saw this program that showed her house, and there is no way all of her children can live in it. And she is a single mother!! She cannot financially support them. It's so ridiculous. I wish people could think more clearly about their futures.|`|ZTRakv6maa	i think her children should be given to parents who cannot have children of their own. as for the 6 she already had...i think the grandparents should adopt them. the retarded woman that brought them into this world should be sent to a mental hospital and have a court ordered to have her tubes tied! as for the doctors, they should have to foot the bill for ALL of the childrens medical expenses. i think the docotors should also have to pay back the state of california for medical! totally irresponsible!!!!|`|dI6jfLM9aa	i think it was a big mistake for the doctor to even consider allowing this woman to go through with the whole thing!! she has no husband, no job, she is on welfare and she expects everyone of us to pay for her mistake.. her own mother has even moved out to get away from her and those kids. i think she did it for the publicity. i don't like it one bit.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I think the ***** was/is insane|`|UjTYmeX0aa	Hey this is the story that was in the news?  :o) <br>  <br>  First of all- someone needs to check the doctors story because he was not supposed to give her that many fertilized eggs. <br>  <br>  I think this woman should have thought about her situtation. It's nice that she realized that she wanted to have kids. And the fact that they have no father is none of anyone's business. But she should have at least waited until she was financially stable to care for these kids. Bringing kids into the world is no picnic. She was selfish, and now these kids will have to suffer for it.|`|ypJt6poOaa	I think it's all fine as long as our tax money (when there is so little of it as it is, because the nation is broke) is going towards her.<br>  <br>  She has every right to have as many kids as she wants, but it's sickening that she would exploit the nation with these disgustingly high amounts of welfare she is inevitably going to receive. <br>  <br>  But you gotta give the woman her due for carrying and giving birth to EIGHT babies. My mom is having trouble carrying one. She must be physically strong to say the least!|`|zd8WW4PFaa	I think if she KNOWS she can care for every single one properly, which may be difficult in her situation, that would be fine. <br>  <br>  But if she isnt sure how shes going to take good care of all of them I think its completley irresponsible.|`|3oSQQt6maa	I think it is wrong since she is using the Government to support her children. But it is her decision to have so many kids.
7768a8b096223f023e244d521482f3c2aa	im so sorry to here this is happening to you...... you can request to have your hormones checked but then i did need to wait till my period for that..... you should be able to request a scan as well surly they cant say no they should be doing everything and anything to help you not feel stressed out bout this coz stress will make matters worse as you no..... ive had a lot of problems with my ovaries and trying to get pregnant since i had an ectopic i've started taking vitamin b complex there meant to be good for problems with ovary's  and apparently red peppers lol!! sounds crazy i no but im willing to try anything you can get the vitamin b complex from your local supermarket or chemist..... i hope things get better hun xx|`|qayCggxMaa	You don't mention what kind of doctor - Have you seen a specialist (or at the very least an OB/GYN)?  I'd start there because there are more tests they can and should be doing including the ultrasound you mention and hormone tests.  The other thing is, if they are absolutely sure you are not pregnant (ultrasound probably for that, or at least pregnancy hormone blood test) then you could probably start the pills without waiting for your period (I had a sort of similar situation but wasn't trying to get pregnant).
bmoCpcdraa	sure as long as he doesn't wan't to take her places by herself',but,if he was not a good friend of yours then don't get it started, i can see you already are questioning yourself ,which is a bad sign.i hope i helped,it may be o.k for him to have her rake his yard or other type jobs if you are around but not to go play|`|2c2W4zQJaa	No.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's too old to be your friend.<br>  <br>  <br>  He can be someone you talk to or someone who can be your mentor but he's not a buddy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Find someone your own age.|`|73458eadba0f98a5aadf5ddb0b5dc1ceaa	NO.<br>  I mean, it's possible he was saying it be nice. But if he actually tries to be your friend that is just pedophile-like. <br>  If he wants to make a diffence in a young person's life he can join Big Brothers Big Sisters.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Talk to your mom and dad about this. There may be a perfectly good outcome from a friendship with this man, but your parents should be constantly aware of what is going on in that friendship.|`|Kpn4xceEaa	it's fishy that he wants to be friends - I could understand him telling you how sorry he is, etc. and letting you know that he's there to talk to if you're feeling really sad, but . . .|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Only if it's OK with your parents.  <br>  <br>  Never, never keep any secrets from your parents.|`|MN5jKAFZaa	I personally think it is just fine. I am 18 years old now. Starting around the age of 6 till I was 13 I was friends with an older gentlemen who lived down he street. When I was 6 he was around 60. He had lost his wife around the time I was born, and he also had grandchildren who lived on the opposite side of the country. He always had coloring books or board games or card games. I referred to him as a friend, but he was more like a grandfather. Sadly when I was 13 he passed away from a stroke. But he was a great friend to me. As long as your parents know him and trust him and are ok with it. Also you have to be comfortable with it. The fact that you asked this question makes me worry that you are not comfortable with the man, or maybe your family doesn't know him. So I recommend that you talk to your parents about it, maybe you caninvitee him over for dinner.|`|MT2NSq7vaa	NO. not safe, if your parents know him and INVITE him over then okay.  But, don't go into his house and don't be alone with him.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	NO!<br>  What you going to do? Invite him over to play barbies?<br>  I think this raises a big red flag.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	NO!! Do not puruse anything w/ this man!!<br>  <br>  He has ill intentions and is taking advantage of your loss to get to you!!<br>  <br>  DO NOT MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM!!|`|A6JQScr6aa	well it depends on the typ of person he is but yah i think it is ok|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	if he happens to be your grandfather|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Ummmmmmmm noooo. he could be a child molester bc thats not normal|`|cVQMVwmtaa	no thats just creepy
U1h6Dntjaa	Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an annual cereal grain, which serves as a major animal feed crop, with smaller amounts used for malting and in health food. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae. In 2005, barley ranked fourth in quantity produced and in area of cultivation of cereal crops in the world (560,000 km2, or an area larger than continental France).[2] The domesticated form (H. vulgare) is descended from wild barley (H. spontaneum). Both forms are diploid (2n=14 chromosomes) and are inter-fertile [3]. The two forms are therefore often treated as one species, Hordeum vulgare, divided into subspecies spontaneum (wild) and subspecies vulgare (domesticated). The main difference between the two forms is the brittle rachis of the former, which enables seed dispersal in the wild.<br>  <br>  Did you mean to say "barely"?<br>  <br>  <br>  You're a troll, face it.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	support her<br>  my friend had her 1st at 15 and shes turned out to be a fantastic mum<br>  with the right support she will be fine<br>  forget the boy worry about your daughter and grand child for now x x x x|`|yklJCCTlaa	Hello.<br>  Your daughter made a mistake by having sex. The baby has a right to live. Please encourage her to go through with pregnancy. I say this because i have two friends who got pregnant at 15 and 16, they are both 27 now..and they live with horrible regret and guilt because of their abortions. Please! there are soooo many couples who can't have children and this baby would be a great blessing! Good luck!|`|t0mb150gaa	First off sit down with her and go over her options and find one that is best for her. Second try being a better parent to begin with...what kind of morals and values are you teaching her and how involved in her life are you? I would also start making sure this doesn't happen again by not giving her as much freedom as you obviously have until she can be trusted and make better decisions.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	First you and your daughter have to make the decision of whether or not you will keep the baby or give it up for adoption.  Please what ever you do, do not kick her out of the house or punish her for the rest of her life for making this mistake.  If she plans to keep the baby or not she will need to get insurance and go to see a doctor.  Since she is so young she will need help to make sure she will continue her education. She will just need you to be there for her even if the father of the baby will not.|`|AA10927320	it depends on how u feel about abortion i would never  but of coarse im 20 and married   tell her about adoption because she is way to young my neice just had ababy  shes 18 and i tell her things like medical things or things she needs to do with the baby and dude it goes right over her head and doesnt understand  so  i really think ur  daught er should think about  jr prom  spring break is comming up  and just being a kid  shes ur daughter and i dont  think  u want to see her in pain or with a big ol belly yet|`|uKpWUPEUaa	well you seem like you wouldn't ground her or anything but if you think you should, don't she's pregnant and a teenager, she's pretty much condemned herself she doesn't want to think her mother is angry at her, however let her know you aren't pleased with it. Get to know the boy yourself see if he's a good guy or if he's going to be a total a-hole or anything. Help her through it give her advice because obviously you've been through it yourself.|`|k0QRfQ00aa	15? Wow that is pretty tough. I know you are distraught about that. But now is the time to be supportive that is the next best course of action at this point. I am sure she is upset by it all too. Just don't panic make sure she is getting the proper care. But it does help to go to his parents and talk to them maybe if the families get together and talk about the situation it would make it a lot easier for you to deal with. If the boy wants no part of the baby's life you just do what you can to help your daughter through it. You know how it felt when we were pregnant so imagine how she feels. Just hang in there and you will be just fine. I am praying for you guys because I am pretty sure it is a tough situation on everyone involved best of luck!!<br>  <br>  xx|`|akB0gV20aa	That's a tough situation to be in.  But the fact is, there is life coming into the world, and that is never a terrible thing....even if her decision is adoption...its still a beautiful life.  It won't do alot of good to berate her at this point.  I think the best thing to do is sit down with her and discuss her options, and the pros and cons of each.  She needs to be aware of the huge responsibility she is undertaking (even if adoption is the answer, pregnancy itself is a huge responsibility) and let her know that even though she is the one that is pregnant, she is still your underage daughter, and you have expectations for her about how she will act during the pregnancy (no drinking, going to Dr.s appt's, healthy living etc...) finishing school, etc.<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Be there for her, let her decide what she wants to do, its way to late to judge, now its time to support her and help her decide whats best for her and you, be it termination, adoption or becoming a single mom with a supporting grandmother.|`|4cehW3S9aa	Should have raised her better from the start.  Also, you should have better English.<br>  <br>  I would give the baby up for adoption.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Put it up for adoption! She had sex, and is now paying for the consequences. Adoption is the best bet for her as a child and for the innocent baby on the way.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Talk to his mother and figure it out together. Good luck!|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	be there for her...i know its going to be hard but she needs her mom there by her side|`|AA11724894	I have to say that the last time I checked kids do not come with an instruction manual, for all those people who are saying you should have done a better job, screw them, the past is the past, all you can do now is move forward. The best thing for you to do is let your daughter know her options, whether it be keeping the baby, adoption, or abortion. I know many people are against abortion, but, it isn't them, and they are not the ones in the situation. You guys need to figure out what is best for your daughter. And once she makes her decision, be supportive no matter what it is. I got pregnant when I was 14, and my mother wanted me to get an abortion, and when I decided not to, she didn't speak to me for 3 months. Just make sure you are supportive, even if you don't agree with her decision, because the decision is not yours to make.<br>  <br>  - oh by the way to due in august are you giving your baby up for adoption ??????|`|28ux28S0aa	Adoption is a beautiful thing and it is so sad that sometimes it is looked at as not being responsible. There are so many couples that have been waiting for years to be parents and your daughter's mistake can end up being a huge blessing in their lives.<br>  Don't get upset at your daughter. Make sure that she fully understands the consequences that come with all of the different options. Keeping the Baby means growing up really fast and missing out on a lot of things that she is meant to be doing at this time in her life. Abortion can cause a lot of trauma  and emotional problems for years to come. And with adoption she will still learn her lesson especially after 9 months of pregnancy and then labor and delivery, but she will also get another chance at life and also give a beautiful baby to some loving parents.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't refer to the baby as your grandbaby unless she decides to keep the baby and AFTER she has already given birth. I think a lot of girls are pressured into keeping the baby because of their mom's emotional connection with the baby. <br>  <br>  Whatever happens, love your daughter, mistakes happen.|`|XL54dM52aa	well coming from a 15 year old who is pregnant. i would want my mom to just help me out try not to stress out to much its alot for her to take and she prolly doesn't want you getting mad at her. shes going threw alot right now i know because it really sucks and my mom is freaking out at me. let her do things on her own but if she wants your help then help her with everything you can shes so young and this is a BIG responsibility for her. if you want her to get an abortion or put the baby up for adoption then talk her about it if she agrees then go for it but if she disagrees tell her what shes getting herself into but it is really her decision. <br>  the boy thing im not really sure what to say because im in the same boat. have her tell him in privet and let him make the decision on weather or not to be there but give him time it will prolly take him a while before he actually understands whats going on.<br>  good luck. <br>  if you need anything else you can message me <br>  prettybabi45@yahoo.com|`|OCTvfDsxaa	I was 16 when I got pregnant. My mom was so angry with me-she forbid that I see the babies father after she found out. My advice to you is to try and stay calm. Your daughter needs your support she don't need to be stressed out in pregnancy. Whatever you do don't for bid her to see him because she will do it anyway and she will just resent you. (And the baby needs a father.)If you have a friend to support you/you can talk to-that would be good. Find a support system for you to lean on too.|`|KU2wqJVhaa	This may sound a little ridiculous, but have you ever watched the Secret Life of the American Teenager? It's kind of your same situation. Watching it may give you a little insight on things to come. Get information about adoption. If she doesn't want to be pregnant, talk to her about abortion. It's better if it's done by a doctor. Some girls get so desperate they try and do it themselves. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|6ErVPePEaa	Do not encourage her to give that baby up. You should be there for her, and explain all possible situations.. such as adoption, keeping the baby... etc.... If you are willing to be there and help her raise the baby that is one thing.. This is always a sad case because so many of these girls do not have caring parents out there. What does she want to do? I bet she is scared to death....All I an say is jsut be there to support her emotionally|`|3w7VztEWaa	Be there for her. She needs you more than anything right now. make sure this boy is going to help with your grand baby. Dont get mad at her it will only stress her out.

Let her know you are there, love her and will help her.|`|EPToPwkcaa	give her lots of love and support but try to let her make her decision about the baby i know this sounds hard as she is so young but if you make her get rid she may end up resenting you for it|`|ACsFkSV6aa	well.. i think your daughter should definitely keep her baby. now is a crucial time for you two to remain close and help each other. dont judge her.|`|A81AJO66aa	just watch the secret life of an american teenager on monday nights and do what amy does.|`|3tiH3rEZaa	Talk to her about adoption.

If for some reason they couldn't, the Dietary Assistants would.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I used to volunteer at a hospital and they were called "food distributors" but I'd imagine every place calls them something different.|`|BQsVPV9Yaa	room service? <br>  thats what they said when they walked it|`|iPEv1lRBaa	Mine called "Dietary" when she walked in the room.  At first I thought she said "Diane Tarry" and I was like, "I'm not Diane Tarry!" LOL|`|EZQIOIxxaa	Mine always yelled "nutrition" when they walked in but I don't know what their title is...
KOwzDLPdaa	I suppose you can pee on anything when you are pregnant but if you are in the middle of a period you are clearly not pregnant. (Unless it is implantation bleeding which is more like spotting than a period) But yeah, sure, waste your money.|`|Qz3sii2caa	Well sure it'd be ok but a little nutty...|`|rdpZrBc9aa	All you do is pee on it.  What's it going to hurt?<br>  <br>  However, if you're having your period, you probably aren't pregnant.|`|KU2wqJVhaa	Absolutely! You can never be sure. There have been people who are pregnant that still get their periods. It's rare but it can happen.|`|UgX3gUSJaa	Well if u have a period then ur not pregnant. But sometimes it does happen......|`|NbgxNAYZaa	What would be the point?|`|EUTRJqCsaa	yes...but if you're on your period then you clearly aren't pregnant...<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: though if the bleeding seems lighter it could be implantation.
CKnHMYHnaa	Don't panic. There are tons of us out there with PCOS and are able to conceive.... it just takes a bit longer and we need a bit of help.<br>  I was diagnosed with PCOS a year ago and am unable to ovulate on my own.  So I was prescribed Metformin (500 mg/3 times a day) took a series of Follistim shots to help my follicles grow, and took an HcG shot to release the follicles when they were of appropriate size.  I underwent an IUI and am now pregnant with triplets.  <br>  Pregnancy can and will happen for you. You need to see a fertility specialist and never give up.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Pcos gives alot of women acne, weight gain, and hair in unwanted place, irregular peiords. It also makes ttc alittle bit more difficult.<br>  <br>  Most of the time if the women goes on a diet she can get pregnant easier...but this is not always the case..sometimes she might need fertility drugs. Before going to the hard core stuff like clomid I'd try Metaformin.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was told I might have pcos (very mild case my only symptom was irregular periods) I just found out I was pregnant last week...no help from anything just naturally.<br>  <br>  You and your wife should beable to conceive just don't give up! GOOD LUCK!|`|Wzws8v8daa	i have pcos too.  pcos is a form of INFERTILITY. so if the doctor is saying she is "fertile" then she doesn't have pcos.|`|Di7KqbVQaa	I have it. And i'm now 9 weeks pregnant. The solution? Ovulation sticks, charting tempretures and the magic that is...preseed. Swear by it. Good luck|`|1xcqr3kAaa	I GOT PCOS. I WENT TO IVF TO DO IUI. AND NOW I'M PREGNANT. DON'T GIVE UP. GOOD LUCK!
33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	It may be heard at 10 weeks, but don't panic if its not found.  Mine was heard at 12 weeks, and it took her a while to find it.  She said sometimes its hard to hear until 14 or so weeks.  Ultrasound picks it up pretty early, I believe...but dopplers are a bit later.<br>  <br>  Good luck I hope you hear it, but don't freak out too much if you don't, its still early|`|WPI0Z47saa	The doppler usually picks up a clear heart beat at 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  Edit: I meant 12 not 2 (I corrected it). The 1 button on my keyboard isn't working well. Sorry for the confusing.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You might be able to hear it then. I think I was 11 weeks when I heard it.|`|eeyGYRcPaa	i heard mine at 10 weeks. :D|`|AA10015577	Normal time for when you can hear a babies heartbeat is around 10-12 weeks.  Depending on how the mommy is carrying it could be a little earlier or later.  HTH!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	I heard my lil mans heart beat on doppler at 12 weeks.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	I just went for my 10 week appt on Tuesday, we were actually able to hear the heartbeat, very faint, but def there. My doctor was very surprised...and so was I. He said it was a little early, but it is obviously possible to hear it a little earlier than expected. Don't freak if they can't find it though, sometimes it takes until about 12 weeks to hear it well with a doppler.
mXfxus58aa	i would make the best of it and love the baby to death and i wouldn't complain. ?|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Hopeful that it would go to one of the many caring responsible couples I know that are trying to adopt.|`|AA11280073	Very stupid idea. Very.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	WAY too young. Kids that young don't know what real responsiblity is, they're just a step above being children, barely teenagers, and they still have a LOT of growing and maturing to do. Let kids be kids. <br>  <br>  if it's an accident....well, then you deal with it. But on purpose? No way.|`|AA10015577	I wouldn't be in that predicament, so I don't know.  I know that I more than likely would NOT abort.|`|IW3jmnKbaa	I think it would be better to have an infant baby, a 14 year old one would probably get stuck.|`|vVeWiYrSaa	(scrubs) quote "ABORT THE BABIES" yes! abort the baby.|`|TrBoPj92aa	at 14, i felt ready to have a baby i was ready to give it as much love as it needed but i was unaware that i was definatly unprepared thank god i didn't have a baby at 14, as my social life would have ended at 14! i would have 0 gcse's and i would be completly stressed out and i probably wouldn't love the baby as much as i thought due to how the rest of my life would have gone pair shaped!<br>  <br>  having a baby a 18 was tough, hell no for 14!!<br>  <br>  wait please x|`|7rkp23uvaa	HOLY MOLY.  I don't know if you are planning it, or know someone who is, but please don't do it.  I am 29 years old with a 7 month old son.  I work from home, I'm married, I have a car and we own a home.  And there are days where I don't think I will make it to lunchtime.  A baby is all consuming, the first priority, and a lot of work. <br>  <br>  You do not get sick days, you do not have the option of quitting or giving up.  Being a parent is the most emotionally demanding job.  When I was 14, I wanted a baby because I thought it would keep my boyfriend around and people would treat me like an adult.  THANK GOD I did not do it.  <br>  <br>  I do know of a girl who had a baby at 12.  I wish you could talk to her.  When she was 18 she had a 6 year old.  She was miserable.<br>  <br>  Wait until you are old enough and emotionally equipped to enjoy a baby.  Like I said, I waited and I still was nowhere near prepared.  You will only be a teen for 4 more years and an adult for the rest of your life.  WAIT on it.  Enjoy these last 4 years.  They are for you to be selfish, something you won't get to do as an adult.|`|AA10064551	I think it would suck, having a baby is a huge responsibility and it hard work. You life changes forever but not it a bad way its good but a 14 year old is not mature enough to handle the type of responsibility it take to raise a child especially a baby.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	I don't think anyone should have a baby until they are mature enough to care for it both emotionally and financially.  At 14, girls are neither emotionally nor physically mature and certainly not financially secure.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	I feel that a 14 year old is still a child and shouldnt be having a child themselves.|`|B27oNdbNaa	It has always been a goal of mine to be a grandma at 30.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	BAD STUPID IDEAS|`|dM55O9odaa	It's a bad idea.<br>  A 14 year old is not done growing...her hips have not widened enough to accommodate a full term baby...so complications usually follow.   This leads to longer recovery time and higher medical bills. <br>  <br>  Also a 14 year old lacks the maturity and adult skills necessary to care for the baby's every need.  She will either have to sacrifice her education or get someone to help her raise the baby so that she can go back to school.|`|a9BMA7wpaa	i think thats a very bad idea beause when ur 14 u have a lot of responsibility just for school alone and that already sucks and then to add a child,wow just way to much so know i wouldnt|`|Jui7jKj0aa	No. babies at 14.. the babies would grow up and be horrible from the example teens have. (no offense)|`|HJXpJxKWaa	A VERY BAD IDEA|`|d5ziwF3Uaa	not to well. thats like a child raising a child
G0QugnQ8aa	only 25 lbs? honey my boys didn't weigh that much until they were over a year old...lol...as for the crawling, maybe he'll go straight to walking, so be ready to be kept on your toes..lol...as long as he isn't displaying any other delays in development and your pediatrician thinks things are OK, then your little boy is fine|`|aJLx0nhNaa	What does your pediatrician say?|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My daughter is 10 months old, and she's been crawling for about a month. She's only 17 lbs, though, so I don't think that has anything to do with it.  Babies all crawl and walk at different stages.|`|os36Q3P2aa	my baby is 9 months old  and he isnt crawling,he pulls himself up (with a bit of help but he has the idea) all babies are different  .Not one of my other 3 kids crawled they all went straight into walking .My daughter  done this shuffle type thing  where she used her hands to pull herself along the floor  until she was 15months ! My doctor said  not to worry as they all do different things at different ages <br>  If you are concerned then talk to your GP  to put your mind at ease <br>  Good luck|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Do you put him on his tummy with his legs tucked under him? It's supposed to help them get ready to crawl.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Some babies dont crawl, they just go right to walking. My son only crawled for a month then he was walking.|`|ldMeuzeUaa	Is he otherwise active - kicking, pushing up, jumping (in a doorway bouncer or exersaucer)? If he is then I wouldn't worry too much but if he isn't attempting to crawl or standing up holding on to furniture by 12 months I would have him checked out.
Xrwvu5Uraa	The chances of you being pregnant could be great considering you had unprotected sex. Taking the pill right now will not do anything. People have said that it carries over after you take it for a while, but my doctor told me that is not true! You should wait until your next missed period or a couple days before you are supposed to get it and take a test. Good lucl.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I got pregnant right after I started a new pack. Im now 23 weeks!|`|9RtdvLEKaa	The good news is that most women ovulate about ten days after their period ends so by the fourth day you shouldn't have been ovulating.  But, you have to be consistent about when you take your pill taking within about two hours of the same time every day that you have to take it and start it on the correct day.  If you don't, the odds of it working are so much less and it can really screw with your system.  All in all, though, I think you should be safe.|`|Xc9KZ4Fxaa	Well, it all depends on when you ovulate. The majority of women ovulate roughly right in the middle of the 28 or so days in between periods. So, statistically speaking your risk may be low, but everybody is different.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Continue taking your pills. Chances are low you're pregnant. The pill won't hurt the baby so early if you aren't.|`|DNygQdmVaa	missing just one pill messes the whole thing up.<br>  umprotected sex  always has chances of leading to a baby ( common sense)|`|6ZUnRxV5aa	There's always a high chance of getting pregnant while having unprotected sex.
slxhzLhcaa	I know they say it takes a while for healthy couples to get pregnant, but dang i know what its like and waiting sucks!!!! If i was you honey i would go to the dr and see if you are ovulating. If you are not they can prescribe you meds to help aid that. Has your husband had a sperm analysis done? Maybe its him? I would check into all these things and see if it is something that is easily fixed. Have you tried taking the home ovulation tests? They help me tons!! I hope this helps and i hope ALL your wishes come true!!!<br>  <br>  ~*~*~*BABY DUST~*~*~*~|`|vcNvEIOwaa	wow....3 months is NOT very long hun.....we've been trying for 8 months and timing intercourse exactly.....read the book Taking charge of your fertility by toni weschler so you can at least understand your body and time intercourse correctly.|`|96HWpdkFaa	A normal couple can take up to 6 months even a YEAR if it goes over a year you should see a doctor.|`|Wzws8v8daa	it's only been 3 months. the average time for a healthy couple to get pregnant is after 6 months of trying.  if you haven't gotten pregnant after 1 full year of trying, then it's time to see a doctor.
AA11432707	Spinal block.  It's easier to place than an epidural, gives great anesthesia and is much safer than general anesthesia (which we reserve for emergencies or other special circumstances)<br>  <br>  We use very skinny needles, and getting the spinal hurts less than getting the IV, or having a contraction. It might sound creepy or painful, bit it isn't.  It's an excellent anesthetic, and you get to see the baby right away.  What could be better?|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Most use an epidural. You may want to ask you health care provider to see what the use, but most these days are epidural.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	That's something you should bring up with your doctor.  I'm not sure if they can even give you an epidural for it with the nature of your spine, which would mean they would have to use general anaesthesia.  <br>  <br>  But I'm not a doctor, it is best to ask them what their course of action is going to be.  <br>  <br>  Either way...epidural or general...at the end of it all you will have a beautiful baby in mind.  Always keep that thought with you!  Good luck!|`|sMukgX7Xaa	I just had one 2 months ago so it's still fresh in my mind lol.<br>  They first put something to calm your nerves down in your IV. Then they give you a spinal which numbs you more than an epidural. It is almost the same thing but a little different. IT feels like a bee sting and that's it. It don't hurt. In my case though I could still feel the dr. when he was testing my numbness...the anesthesiaologist used some kind of drug in my IV and I wasn't all there for the delivery...I was out of it, but remember bits and pieces of it.|`|E8wkkN38aa	You can have an epidural if you want to stay awake during the c-section, or you can have a local anaesthetic if you want to be put to sleep, only thing is you don't get to see your baby till you wake up! Good luck.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Epidural, but I they will give you something through your IV to get your body ready for it first.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	They used a spinal block on me last year when my son was born. Its different from an epidural because they don't leave a catheter in your back. Its a weird feeling but not painful. You get a tiny needle that feels like a little bee sting and then they use the bigger needle that only feels like pressure for a couple of seconds. Its weird but not painful. I was shaking with fear of it and they brought in a "respiratory therapist" who helped me focus while they put the needle in.<br>  <br>  You'll be just fine! And congrats and good luck!|`|6ZDkpeZSaa	either an epidural or a spinal block (both of which numb the lower part of yer body but dont knock you out) or, if time is of the essence, a general anesthetic (which does put u to sleep but is sometimes necessary in an emergency when it becomes critical to delicer the baby immediately).|`|bcf6d0a7e790277666d07ee81dfc0e21aa	they give 4 different kinds <br>  <br>  but i dont know way they are called u should ask ur doctor
rdpZrBc9aa	You're definitely pregnant.  It takes a few days after intercourse for the embryo to implant and a few more days for your body to make enough hcg for it to show up on a test.  Then it takes more time again for your body to have enough hcg to show up no matter what time of day.  If your test at the hospital was a urine test, it showed negative because you didn't use your first morning urine.  So you probably are close to a month already, or maybe even more.|`|akB0gV20aa	Sounds like you took the test to early the first time.  I would make an appt with your Dr. or request a blood test to confirm.  But I would say you are pregnant for sure!|`|4CzhJUkOaa	Yes, every day makes a difference. Certain level of HCG hormones is required for the home test to turn positive. And the HCG count doubles every 48 hours! So, the results could vary even in just a couple of days. The "1st response" kit directions says that it detects pregnancy almost 5 days before your next expected period. But, taking the test on the 28th-30 th day would be better. they are 99.9% fail proof.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	You are now pregnant. you dont need any more opinions. The test you took at the hospital were only coming up negative because the hormone wasnt strong enough to be detected yet. you most likely were already pregnant though|`|FtucqO02aa	some pregnancys tests can confirm your pregnant 4 days before your next period and some can tell you how far along you are so id get one of those
7rKUmK0qaa	definitely not in your stomach i hope! Lots of acid there.<br>  If you're pregnant the baby should be in your uterus which is below your belly button. <br>  Usually the beginning of your pregnancy you dont feel hungry infact you feel sick all the time that you cant even swallow food.|`|903870f5a8058e4e2098147be4687cb4aa	Take a test|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Take a pregnancy test on the day your period is supposed to start, or 5 days before if you take first response. <br>  <br>  Even then, I'd seriously hope the baby is not in your stomach, but rather your uterus. I wouldn't want your baby to have to tough it out through a highly acidic enviorment.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Nope, no matter how much unprotected sex you had, I guarantee you that you do not have a baby in your stomach.<br>  <br>  Your uterus on the other hand...|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You could be but your body wouldn't be showing symptoms so soon.|`|3w7VztEWaa	possibly.take a test.|`|WCXCYNgRaa	It's possible, if your period still hasn't come in a week after it's supposed to, I'd get a pregnancy test.  good luck!|`|bcf6d0a7e790277666d07ee81dfc0e21aa	u should go to a clinic to be more sure i think u could be <br>  <br>  <br>  if ur back hurts <br>  u feel very sleepy and tired<br>  u want to vomit|`|bfs5thLkaa	yes honey you can be pregnant, but you can also be stressed out. Go get a test and find out.
rFtKFp03aa	well if its little like a crib.. a crib sized.. <br>  <br>  if it is a day bed.. ( twin size ) then you need a twin size ? lol <br>  <br>  Not sure if I am confused on what you are asking.. <br>  <br>  But I think it is as simple as that..
LWXRVO5Haa	If you are feeding the baby with a bottle after pumping this will only worsen his latching problems! Your supply will even itself out pretty soon and you will leak less at night. I had the same problem in the beginning.|`|w3ob12X6aa	yeah that use to happen to me i would wake up and freak out because i would be soaked. so i just would wake up in the middle of the night and pump, thats really all you can do.|`|AA11903503	Don't pump your breast empty or just for relief, they will just keep making more milk. <br>  Hand express enough so your baby can latch (so you can compress comfortably the areola and sandwich the breast so baby can latch).<br>  As for the leaking, it will get better. Are you nursing at night? Nurse from both breasts at night to get some relief. You may also want to buy better nursing pads (reusable if you can find them), and make sure you are wearing a bra that fits to bed. Medela makes a very comfy sleep bra.|`|SrRafsqraa	I would recommend pumping at night.  I had to pump exclusively for 3 months straight (my milk only went that far) for all of her feedings.  Even if my husband fed the baby at night I would still wake up and pump. You won't have as much leaking and won't wake up as engorged.  Every now and then I would skip a night pumping--but I'd regret it in the morning!  Plus the night feedings is always an extra bottle to add to the supply that you are providing the baby...and trust me pumping exclusively you will want to keep your supply as ahead of the game as you can!  Good luck!  It's alot of work!!!|`|R33f3Ff6aa	Right before you nurse your baby hand express some milk so it's easier for your baby to latch on.  I had the same problem and my milk supply finally settled down to what my baby needs after about 2 weeks.  If you need to pump after you nurse your baby but you have to pump within 10 min of nursing your baby so it doesn't interfere with the next feeding.  Good luck and congrats!|`|ZTRakv6maa	at night, take a hot shower and then after..pump pump pump. the heat actually lets your milk drop.  that why when you wake up in the morning, it might not be as bad. after i had my sons, i would even sleep with a towel across my chest.|`|93TC1Yxlaa	Stop pumping, unless you are storing milk for future use.  Pumping is just telling your body to produce more milk. If you must hand express a small amount before you nurse to allow baby to latch on more easily, do so.  In a short time, your body will adjust its' milk production to accommodate your baby's needs.  Be patient. Nature has a way of working these things out.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	they make rubbery breast pads that sort of stick on your boob to keep you from leaking. <br>  <br>  pumping is only going to increase your milk supply, so I wouldn't suggest that unless you're storing it for use at a later date.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|eIjiI0M8aa	I'm sure it won't be fun but pump in the middle of the night if you have to.
Vjem5OJhaa	If you are between puberty and menapause, and you have had sex (even protected), there is a chance you could be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test or consult your doctor.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wait until your period is due, then test.|`|MRWDXeXsaa	Sounds like your pregnant. I would get a pregnancy test to find out for sure.|`|HGc979qiaa	yes
AA10927320	rasberry leaf tea havent tried it but iim really really depending on it i plan to start drinking it at 34 weeks  i got 9 weeks to go  castor oil but u either take a big crap and start having contraction or have the runs  i even heard pineapple  and licorice not the candy but the pills  500mg a day|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Sounds like it might be soon!  No ideas on how to get it going besides keep walking, but don't over do it...try to conserve some energy.  I think you are so close!  <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck :)|`|eIjiI0M8aa	I'd say you are pretty close to going into actual labor. I'm surprised they didn't induce you at 3 cm. I was 3 cm when I went in to the hospital..50% effaced I think. Other than sex, just walk walk walk. Good luck!

r4N245AOaa	I think thats awful....me and my sister have always been really close and never wanted to see one another get in trouble....no one should want to see any of there family members get hurt anyway!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Yes, yes hse does.|`|qRElKKjXaa	Yes, it sounds like she is into Sado-Masochism. (not sure of spelling). <br>  Sadists find pleasure in other people experiencing pain, and masochist seek out pain.<br>  <br>  It's incredibly wrong that her dad is spanking his teenage daughters anyway, especially if he's doing it so hard that they scream out in pain. <br>  Maybe your friend started liking it as a coping mechanism or something, to make the trauma less intense. <br>  <br>  Or maybe she just has a fetish. There are TONS of ppl on this site who do. There is one guy here who only ever asks and answers questions about it - like 2000 questions about spanking. SOOOOOOOOOOO............. I guess it's not that uncommon. Unfortunate and really weird, yes, uncommon, guess not.|`|iZk9jEBpaa	Maybe it makes her feel good about herself, i love it when i see other kids get in trouble at school or my brother getting shouted at by my parents so i can see where she's coming from.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Are you on about the same people who made a sex tape????<br>  <br>  Hmm.<br>  <br>  Your stories in your questions don't add up..<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I wouldn't say she has a problem perse but it is a little weird.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Yes...|`|tkQq5tR1aa	Wow, I'd say that she's....incestually, sadistically, and possibly maniacally kinky. <br>  <br>  Something's wrong if someone gleefully indulges in watching other females get punished by their fathers. Have you asked her if her Dad has done anything...oh I don't know...sexually to her and her sister?|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I don't know, it depends. When I was younger and me and my sister got in trouble, I would laugh when she was getting spanked. When it was my turn, she thought it was hilarious. Although, I must say, spanking at 14 is very unorthodox.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	I laugh when people trip or get in trouble or are hurt. <br>  <br>  One kid at school last year fell over, had an asthma attack, and I couldn't help but break out laughing.<br>  <br>  It's nobodies business really. She probably just feels better about herself.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Yes,This is cruel and extremely abnormal to like the site of seeing people suffer.She needs some counseling.|`|TYQOafA8aa	Yes, she's a sadist|`|Oyktk3rHaa	yeah a big problem.. thats not funny|`|b86bf6cae0048b823e2051ef1aee564faa	go to a psycho ward !|`|m3rsLUgDaa	i think you know she does|`|UAJjnsBuaa	no. (sarcasem) yes|`|lb8FBhWnaa	Thats just weird.|`|t1cVVbGMaa	hehe|`|Mclot3ewaa	YEAH WHAT A PERV
Xrwvu5Uraa	thats not true...even my doctor didn't ask me if i had taken an at home test before she tested me and I didn't tell her that I did.<br>  <br>  I did take a HPT and it came out negative when in fact I was really pregnant.<br>  <br>  you should definetly go to your doctor, if you seen a faint line, it's positive. it's rare to get a false positive.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I would say you aren't pregnant.
P5CLeokmaa	I'm sorry there really to "good" sounding names, but there cute.<br>  <br>  I really don't like Dawn, or April, or really Angel..<br>  <br>  Autumn..umm well its okay, i  just don't like the others.<br>  <br>  but it's cute..but i don't like it.<br>  <br>  do you like it??<br>  <br>  it doesn't really matter if anyone else likes it. its if YOU like it.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Autumn Angel?  Hahahahahahaha.  No way.  It just sounds like a joke to me.  An exotic dancers stage name perhaps?<br>  <br>  April Dawn isn't quite as bad.  April?  Sure.  Dawn?  Okay.  Not together though.|`|AA11065140	Not unless you're planning on having them grow up to be porn stars...|`|gzQIstDFaa	i dont like either of them|`|25mfL9UXaa	I'm sorry but I don't like any of them. Something with two different initials for the names would be better.|`|h9J8XWF7aa	Nah, they sound too perfect, in that snobby kind of way. Nice simple names are the best choices.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I like the names Autumn and Angel but I think together it is too many "A" sounds.  April Dawn sounds ok. I wouldn't use it but it doesn't sound too bad,.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Both are horrible.
Rw2aM6B1aa	Just take a test... and go to a gyno. You may also be starting menopause.|`|l6rsKrpjaa	Well stranger things have happened...I had my tubal ligation the day after my second son was born and eleven months later was PREGNANT again and this time with twins. However I have a sneaky suspicion that you are not pregnant you maybe experiencing pre-menopausal symptoms. A soft cervix is not an indication of pregnancy rather an indication of labor in pregnant women. You said yourself that you are a little overweight....combo that with dietary factors such as sodium consumption bloating is a common problem. Have you kept track of your food and drink intake since your pants became tighter? You may have also pulled a muscle in abdomen causing swelling. Your earliest symptoms of pregnancy are: exhaustion(not just tired), sore or swollen breasts, vaginal discharge called lochia...you will know the difference from normal discharge as it is thicker and more abundant.Best thing to do if you are concerned is to get a test from the dollar store and pee away.
rIzx4OEWaa	Hello Leala315, You have asked a very sensible question which shows your maturity. No one should go through with this if they have doubts. I wonder did you discuss this with your husband before you got married? he had a right to know. How ever it is only natural to have doubts, becoming a parent is a hard thing an will be very demanding on you especially if you will be on your own for most of the time. Your husband is doing his best to provide you with a secure future even if that means putting his life at risk over seas in another country. He needs to know that you will support him while he is away an has the right to want a family but it still takes two,. You too have rights an as its your body yours should be the final choice. OI would hope that the service which he is in will support you in everything should the need a rise. They will give you the best of care an will do everything possible to allow him home for the birth. I am sure that both your familys will also give you all the support you would ever need. Children may make things hard in the first few months but they are a real blessing in every other way which only a parent will know. You will go through so many emotions each day will be a new discovery to you, You never know perhaps after the baby is born he will want to leave the service? I served some time in the army an found them to be very supportive of my family while I was away, I decided to leave in order to help my wife raise our children together an while I missed the service life I would have missed so much more. I would say that you should write to your husband an tell him that you are scared about having a family with him so far away all the time an see what he has to say? I don't know how old you both are but I became a father at 20 years of age an we have now been maried 33 years this March, my wife is only one year older than I. We have had many ups an down s an had to make sacrifices for our children but they have all been worth it. I pray for the day when they themselves settle down an want to start a family of there own because I know just how great they will be as parents as I am sure you will be. What ever you decide to do let it be your choice but make sure you work it out for the good of you both an your future. I wish you well.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	Those feelings are all normal. Throughout my pregnancy, I always worried about what sort of mom would I be? Will I be able to provide for my child? Will he be born with a birth defect? So many questions plagued my mind day and night. In the end, everything fell into its place. I know people may think I'm a horrible mom, but I try my best to be there for my son, and I love him with all my heart. I don't take what people say about my parenting skills to heart because everyone has their own opinion on how to raise a child.<br>  <br>  To get yourself ready, I think you should do some researching on single parenting to prepare yourself for those times when your husband is deployed. What you're doing now, asking others for their experiences is already a good step.|`|8Gcyr0T1aa	Deployed; is he Army? There is a website www.campbellunderground.com It's a bunch of army wives. Or you can try bookoo.com, and find a city near you (it'll show yardsale sites). Click on the yardsale site near you, then once you get there, there should be something in the upper right corner about their undergound (big chat room of military). That might help you. Good luck.|`|WBsLOEOwaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I am not exactly in your position, my husband is not deployed, but your fears and worries are totally normal.<br>  <br>  I never wanted children when I got married, had worked really hard with my career and thought that was all I needed, and to be honest when I fell pregnant it took me about a month to accept it, but you do accept it and suddenly your 'bump' becomes the most precious thing in the world to you.<br>  <br>  I am 19 weeks pregnant tomorrow, and I am still worried about how I will be when the little one arrives.  I look at my husband now playing with friends kids and know he will be a great dad, but then I think about myself and how I have never been great kids, I constantly worry about how I will be with my own one!  <br>  <br>  Maybe, when you can and are ready, you could sit down with your husband and tell him your concerns and worries, I did with my husband and it was like a huge weight lifted of my shoulders.  <br>  <br>  Good luck x
Xrwvu5Uraa	it could be from the plan B pill...but it doesn't normally throw off your cycle. it's doubtful that you are pregnant too because of taking the pill...you should still go to your doctor to take a test there. then you can know for sure. and stop having unprotected sex because the plan B pill isn't something to take all the time...|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Plan B can mess up your cycle.  However, you need to be on the pill about 3 months before it's at it's full potential to protect against pregnancy, so you may be pregnant.  Talk to your Dr. about what's going on, he/she may do a blood test to check.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Plan B is a months worth of birthcontrol in two tiny pills.  You took it twice so you forced two months worth of birth control into your body in one single month, plus starting on birth control.  That is a ton of hormones so you should expect your period to be off for awhile until your hormones get under control.  If your still concerned I would take another test in a week or two, it should definately be very accurate by then.  I think your fine and it's just from all the hormones.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	Sometimes BC can throw off your period and change the cycle a bit. You should try to not be having unprotected sex until about a month of BC has been used. It takes a bit to kick in. If you still don't have your period by the end of the month relax sometimes you skip it when you start BC but if not again in March take a test.    If for any reason you feel that you may be pregnant go a head and take a test at the end of the month. Just to be sure. Better safe than sry. GL|`|VHgfWPS2aa	Your not pregnant !
WxQFe0GYaa	There's really no average, unless you're looking at percentiles.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter was also born 8lbs 10oz. At her 6 month check up she was almost 17lbs and 26inches. I stepped on the scale with her today (she's 7 months now) and it read 19lbs!|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	There are no average babies they are all little individuals, enjoy him love him and protect him and you will both be fine.|`|fjZeVLOQaa	every baby is different i read somewhere that at? a certain age babies sart to slow on weight intake 3oz-5oz a week is average weight gain my little boy is? 6 months and ive noticed this and hes putting on average a 1lb a month the health visitor said this is fine hes now 16lb 5oz
8WbfmK5daa	I dropped week 35. Its week 39 now and she's still not here :(|`|2cj7Eai8aa	my first one it was 3 days but the second it was about a month|`|OCTvfDsxaa	I've had four healthy pregnancies and I Lasted an average of two weeks after I dropped. But like you said-everyone is different.
Xrwvu5Uraa	you are looking at a very rare chance of her getting pregnant. good luck.|`|kw80YHMLaa	Well if you managed to pull out before you came and she is on birth control and taking it properly then there is a very strong possibility that she is not pregnant. I think that was what you asked!|`|47iY7d5Laa	Well, if you were out of her and it broke afterwards, and nothing went inside, then shes fine.. but it may have been cracked during intercourse and you didn't notice, she might be pregnant.<br>  <br>  So, in the case that any sperm got into her, a lot of it depends on how long she was on Birth Control. It takes most woman about 3 months before BC actually becomes active, but everyone is different.<br>  <br>  I suggest asking her when she started BC, and having her buy a few pregnancy tests to take a few days before her next period is due.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	If you were out all the way there really should be no real worry. Plus the spermicide and the BC. Depending on how long she has been on BC (3 months) would make it that 99.9% that she won't be. I dont think that you have anything to worry about.|`|3DrSrzHAaa	Go to the drugstore and ask for Plan B.|`|OYjZM4Pjaa	Yeah... I'd say you have nothing to worrry about.|`|mqK1bnxBaa	she wont get pregnant.
mGCYkqXNaa	Well I wasn't TTCing but I had 2 or 3 days of VERY light blood. (maybe 15 drops throughout the whole, what I thought was a "period") I had just started the pill and assumed it'd already drastically taken effect and that was the shorter lighter period. <br>  <br>  ....and then 2 weeks later I started puking two to three times a day for a week and a half. Eventually missed the next period and the one after that....boobs got huge and vein-y, etc, etc....|`|GEfpzUNvaa	i wish youluck.. i have never noticed any implantation bleeding.. but we are trying to get pregnant.. umm so i would say if you don't want to test and have a negative then i would wait till you are late enough. good luck and i hope for the positive test for you and wish us luck for next month...|`|sD5wtzpfaa	I would wait it out and see what happens. I am in the same boat. My AF is due on the 23 and I had a light light spot of brown today. Never have it before AF. GL Baby Dust!!|`|ESAM0U7xaa	i think the bleeding can be different...some light red, pink or brown... it's hard to say. i would think it would only last a day or two if it is implantation bleeding :)
veO1RXrCaa	Nope.  If you had a period and were pregnant it would most likely not be a uterus cleaning out heavy one.|`|dpPqH7BAaa	It is very rare that you can have your period during pregnancy, but it does happen. My grandmother during the 60's was on the pill and still got pregnant, but didn't know until she was almost 8 months along because she still got her period. The reason was because she had a weak cervix and other problems from her last pregnancy. This combined with what the pill did to her body caused her to have her period. This is a rare case though. The chances of you being pregnant is highly unlikely. You could have an infection that is causing you to be irregular, even stressing about being pregnant can effect your cycle. Any change in diet, exercise, or surroundings can effect when you get your period and how heavy or light it may be.|`|a0BEAk5yaa	no
wBpennsMaa	There is always a chance of pregnancy if you have had sex, even if it was protected.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	i dont think so that acctually doesnt sound good, you may have a yeast infection or something, discharge is a part of pregnancy but not 3 days after intersourse, and usually not very yellow....|`|P8vt2aLhaa	Sounds like a reaction to the condom maybe or an infection if it persists then I would go see your dr. as far being pregnant you may not know until next month depending on how your body reacts.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	if you did become pregnant from the condom splitting a few days ago you would not have any signs or symptoms yet anyhow, and normally you ovulate 11/14 days before your period is due not a few days before|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Get to an std clinic!|`|kcrXrntnaa	i don't think so, it could be a yeast infection, i'd get it checked out either way. good luck!
c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	You know, you sound like me! I had one miscarriage at 10 weeks [concieved naturally] and one failed IVF attempt - my partner also has a low sperm count. Was your pregnancy concieved naturally?  Things he can do to improve count - eat healthy, lots of fruit and veg, take a male vitamin supplement, eat brazil nuts, no alcohol :-(, no caffiene, no smoking, no hot baths, wear boxer shorts or nothing at all.  Good luck, and wish me luck too x|`|rmse6Mj8aa	foxy lady is right. all the advice she gave you is right.  you need to get him to have cooler baths, look after those balls and dont wear tight jeans or tight boxers,   take vitamin supplements but most importantly is Zinc. this helps in the production of sperm and needs to be taken for about 3 months onwards for it to start working.  no drugs, alcohol and less caffeine. although there are some debates about caffeine actually helping and stimulating sperm.  no smoking or recreational drugs.  exercise and healthy diet really help too.    good luck|`|AcOVnKtlaa	Hi there,    This must be a difficult time for you.I can understand your stress and frustration.    More than 50% of all infertility problems experienced by couples are caused by male infertility. And of the most common causes of male infertility is having a low sperm count. There are many different factors which could be responsible for a low sperm count and there are also things that can be tried to increase sperm count.    Eat right- This is where it all starts. Our body is the perfect reflection of what we eat and the same applies to our sexual life and sperm count. Due to fast life everyone out there is into fast food. In order to increase sperm count your husband need to increase the intake of vitamin rich foods and consume as much natural foods as possible.    Water- Water is one of the best solutions to all health problems and does help in increasing sperm count as well. Make it a point to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day if not more.    There are particular foods your husband should take to increase his sperm count,there are also simple ways to do to avoid having low sperm count. More about them you can see on source articles.

89TgOjXpaa	First off all you shouldn't be having sex at that age... you are only children but its too late for the lecture right now, the best thing you can do is sit down with her parents and tell them that you are pregnant and plan on supporting her and the baby, and you must Finnish school and get a part time job and be pre pared to look after the GF and baby and it will be hard it ain't easy looking after children and make sure you are ready for all of this. this is going to change your And GF's life forever having a baby is a big responsibility but make sure you have family support as you will need it to get through this, and you both should sit down and discuss what you two are going to do in regards to the baby situation and where you will live etc..  best of luck!

FYI: Many people who post read previous answers and questions to help get a better idea about who you are so that they can answer you better. I have been tricked into a lot of BS by people on here.    If you are really 14 and not covering as I see you blocked your profile, then you obviously need to talk with your parents first set a game plan and have a sit down with her and her parents. Together you can come up ith options best for you both.|`|1uNc22vKaa	At your age abortion really is the best idea, if she is willing.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	maybe you guys should consider adoption, abortion is deff not the way but you are very young and have a full life ahead of you,plus i can see you want to be involved but if her parents hate you they can make that very hard...and you would be very hurtfull for you and the baby...think this through before you make any rask decisions|`|kprKXEOSaa	Um, excuse me for being vulgar, but you're 14, so I'm assuming she is 14 too.  You've been banging their daughter, and you wonder why her parents don't like you?!  When you have a daughter someday (ok, maybe someday soon by the looks of it,) and some pimply boy is panting after her, you're going to want to kill him, too.    Anyhoo....  encourage her to give the baby up for adoption.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	get a job and prepare for 18 years of child support.   Or her father kills you and puts you out of your misery.|`|2LSx5ru4aa	how stupid are you?? if you were having sex why didnt you use condoms??? I guess you deserve that now for being so careless. At any rate, you're screwed now. you could talk her into an abortion or something like that.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	well this is not good.  I think you all should look into adoption, b/c bottom line at your age her parents are going to raise that baby, not you 2.  If they aren't willing then things will be very hard, almost impossible.  You are barely old enough to even get a job.  How old is the girl?|`|YyX0EJDRaa	You obviously enjoyed the sex so be ready to face the consequences regardless of your age!|`|9Jnrhm8Yaa	At 14 you probably shouldn't be having sex anyway ...

Talk to her parent. Talk to them with respect show them that you are serious and responsible. No matter how much they yell at you, do not loose your temper. Say, I know you hate me.. but i love your daughter and i would do anything to take care of her and the baby. Keep your word.|`|dpPqH7BAaa	Well, no offense but you didn't really help the situation with her parents liking you. However the best thing you can do is sit down with your girlfriend and write out a plan of what you want to do when the baby comes. Are you going to support her, and are you going to be in school? Things like that. When the time is right to tell her parents, what you can do is sit down with them together and tell them how you plan to take care of the child. It will show that you are trying to be responsible and step up to the plate.|`|8K3IucU3aa	you need to tell your friends to learn from your mistake and you need to get a job as soon as you get of age and take care of the baby. here's another suggestion stop having sex. and if you just have to at least where a condom. and also you can even go to the fire department and i think the police station and drop the baby off there they won't ask any questions they'll just take it i know the fire department won't so if you don't want the baby and you don't want to go through adoption thing just do that but try to be more responsible now.
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My husband and I both put our responsibility towards parenting first in our lives.  That's what we chose to do when we decided to have children together.  I can't imagine having any respect for him if he shirked that responsibility, even if it was to put me first.  And, I don't think he'd have much respect for me if I did the same or asked him to put the kids needs aside due to a desire of mine.  <br>  <br>  That doesn't mean we never have time alone together, never have time to ourselves, never do anything besides cater to the kids.  We just put that responsibility first in our lives, making sure it is taken care of properly.  We take our parenting responsibility seriously. <br>  <br>  Parenting, the time we have to teach & influence them, is so very temporary, really.  It goes so quickly.  We're grownups.  We are aware of how quickly time passes.  We can live our commitment to the kids fully, knowing that, later, there will be time to do other things.  <br>  <br>  I think the problem with 'putting marriage first' comes into play when one or both of the parents has a problem with feeling jealous of attention that the children are getting from the other adult.  Or, when one or both parents feels that they have personal needs that they cannot take care of themselves and require the other adult to do these things for them.    <br>  <br>  We don't have that problem in our marriage.  We're both pretty self sufficient, if necessary - not needy.  We are in this relationship because we *want to* be, not because we need each other to survive.  That said, we do *want to* be together.  We enjoy parenting together.  We enjoy doing other things together.  We love sharing our life's journeys side by side and we do support each other along the way.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I don't like that we have to even think about putting our husband or children *first*. I think the question is a non-issue. If our child and our spouse was drowning, of course we'd save our kid first. If our spouse's mother dies and our kid wants to play legos with you, of course we'd comfort our husband first. So I think the notion of spouse or kids coming first just doesn't make much sense. Our *family* comes first, plain and simple.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Any spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend that expects their SO to put them first rather than the children isn't worth being with, in my opinion. I'm not sure what parent would honestly expect their spouse to put them first rather than their own children, but I suppose it can (unfortunately) happen.|`|8RfmosODaa	Yep my son always comes first! Kids are the most important thing in the world! I think that parents should put their kids first. They should be their top priority!|`|lzivF4Idaa	of course i put my baby first!!! <br>  <br>  why should i? because he's my son.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I think that putting a child first is what we all should be doing, but there are cases when you must put your self first. <br>  I say this because things like health problems...

But if it comes down to getting something my baby needs or getting something I need, baby gets hers first every time.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Yeah, she does and the one of the way will be no different|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	all kids should be put first. I know that i put my daughter before any thing else...|`|COecrPrMaa	Easy answer? - My daughter comes first.  If a situation is going to affect her in a negative way... I should keep her out of the situation or do my best to prevent it.  No matter what you do, when you are a mother (or father), it is a full time job and your life revolves around your kid/s.<br>  <br>  Hard answer... well, in order to have a happy child there must be a happy mother, happy father, and overall happy home.  Sometimes Mommies and Daddies need to put themselves first.  Sometimes we simply can't make the right decision based on 'how will this affect my child'.  <br>  <br>  However, I would never put my significant other before my daughter.  I'm not married (or divorced for that matter) but I know how hard it is to keep a relationship together.  Having Mommy and Daddy together isn't always in the best interest of the child, so if you are in a situation where its best to part with your SO, WHY WHY WHY put him (or her) first?  If you are having issues with your hubby and you know you can work it out and it is best for the kids involved, then work it out.  Either way you still should put the kids best interests first.  Its not a matter of teaching a kid that it is about them, it is a matter of being a mother to a child and raising a child because from before you even give birth - that child comes first (at least the child SHOULD come first.)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Yes my kids basic needs come first. <br>  There is times that I put myself first though ( in small things) like when my 3 year old is screaming outside the bathroom door just because he wants to see me, but I'm just going to finish my shower because I dont want to smell bad even though at the moment it makes him upset.  <br>  I'm also planning to go back to school so I have to leave my 2 year old with someone else which I'm sure she wont appreciate but its still going to happen because I want to go to school to get a degree so I can get a better job. <br>  If the house was on fire and there were 10 people inside including my kids I would run around disregarding others until I found my kids and pulled them out. <br>  Or if I had to pick between my friends and my kids I would pick my kids.<br>  If me and my husband want to go see a movie and the kids dont want us to go, we would still go because our relationship is important too. For us and for them too. <br>  So yeah, someways kids do come first and  in others they dont at the moment. Like my going to school is going to better their lives too, even though at the moment they might not agree.|`|hh5E9n4Oaa	I think that it depends on the childs age, for instance of course a newborn and infants needs come first because you want to establish that bond with them that you will always be there to care for them.  However as your child becomes a toddler, they are so self absorbed because mommy and daddy has  always stopped on a dime to take care of them that you need to begin to take their focus less off of themselves and teach them that other people have feelings, emotions, and needs.  This way they can establish social relationships and become independent while realizing that other people exists.  If you are arguing with your spouse, it should not be done within ear shot of the child in the first place.  If it is, you should console the child obviously because the last thing that child needs when they lack emotional self control is to see their parents lose control in the heat of an argument.  But arguments when possible should be done behind closed doors.  As far as if I had to choose my marriage or my child in my opinion the worse thing for my child is to grow up without a father, divorce hurts children emotionally and developmentally so i would work through the marriage and show my child that it works if you work it.  Things have a way of working out in the end.  I have been together with my spouse ten years and almost married six.  We have a child that is almost three.<br>  <br>  Edit: I never said you argued with your spouse, I simply answered your "scenarios" one of them being do you console a child during an argument and my opinion of your "scenario" was to simply not argue in front of the child and that way you wouldn't upset them.  If you didn't want people to look at the scenarios then you shouldn't of put them on there.  Another thing try not to insult a persons intelligence it makes you look more foolish.|`|nPtzoAmAaa	I guess I agree and disagree with alot of what is said on here. <br>  I have to say my husband comes before my children, my marriage comes before them. I know that it seems awkward and not really like the right answer, but the fact is my marriage is the foundation of my family, which in turn is the foundation for my children. <br>  <br>  I saw your example of a crying baby, but part of putting a marriage first is realizing when to work on certain issues, doing it in front of your kids, right after work, while cooking dinner, none of these are really a good idea. I find when we need to work something out my husband and I have to make it a point to be alone, be in a calm and quiet situation, otherwise both of us become stressed. <br>  <br>  I would like to ask this question, say your child is now a teenager and you feel your child should be allowed to do something, maybe participate in a club or something you truly believe will be of value to them in the future, but for some reason your husband disagrees, and doesn't just disagree but refuses to allow your child to do so, (maybe he has a good reason, but not as good as yours as far as your concerned) what do you do?<br>  <br>  See, i can honestly say, even if I feel adamantly about it, and feel I'll have to discuss it further, in the end if he still says he's against it, then I feel that it is not a reason to put pressure or stress on the marriage. I think it is really hard to say, based off of one circumstance whether you choose your child first in everything. Sometimes not choosing them is you choosing to make things at home work, which in turn is still choosing them. I don't know, maybe I'm just rambling, but I think this question is not one that that easily be answered, at least without thinking everything all the way through.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	Could you elaborate a little? What other options are you considering and what do you mean by "children first?"<br>  <br>  Obviously, children need their parents' support. This however does not mean a life of endless sacrifice to the parents.|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	yes they should definitely come first. thats what parenthood is all about. however be sure to not make other people feel they are not worthy and its all about the kids.|`|hr24wI0daa	Without a doubt there should be nothing in this world that comes before your children and their safety.|`|im3vWyv6aa	Absolutely... this is why I am always hungry, I'm always tired and I'm always late. After all "late" is my middle name...<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  <br>  ADD: I'm guessing "amsam" gave me my thumbs down. I don't understand the marriage thing. I've been married to my husband for almost 16 years. My marriage means the world to me... but a child is helpless. We work together putting the children first... after the children go to bed my husband is numero uno. That is what makes a successful "family" and it shouldn't be any other way.<br>  <br>  ADD2: The funny thing is that when I was answering this, I thought, no one is going to answer "No, I don't put my children first." Weird...<br>  <br>  ADD3: Sorry amsam... your answer didn't sound like that. I apologize. Marriage is definitely a high priority... but there is even a higher priority that makes marriage and family even more successful. But I will stop here.  :0)<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  .
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	we go to Target and they do great! In fact we go in for his 9 month pictures on March 7th. 8 0 ) Plus they are very very affordable.<br>  <br>  if you go to www.myspace.com/futuremrsplante you can see his 3 month pictures... I dont know if I posted his 6 month ones though|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Wal-Mart and Portrain Innovations are pretty good.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I'd look around for local photographers rather than going to a portrait pace like Sears. A lot of hobby photographers will do a much better job without charging heaps. Look in your yellow pages. Most will have websites where you can see their work, and a lot will do work with photoshop(adjusting the colours and lights, not airbrushing your perfect wee angel =)) that will give outstanding results. Most have their own studios, but some may be willing to meet you at a park to do some photos in a more natural setting.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're looking for calenders to be printed, there's heap of places online that will print your photos on hundreds of different mediums. Here's a site that changes the things they have on offer that I use. Fotoclips and the bag are my favourites at the moment.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://photojojo.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Also, when my daughter was a baby I had a photo of her engraved on a pendant. Was only $20 but really striking, and I still get comments on it. Here's one site that does it, but if you have a look round you might find better.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.photoengraving-f2f.com/category/pendants-2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoengraving-f2f.com/catego...</a>|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I got Landon's birthday pics taken at Sears. I really like them. I have also had his picture taken at Walmart and will never go back there again. The picture quality sucked and I had Christmas cards printed and when I  got them in they were in Spanish...and they wouldn't give me my money back. Do you have any private photographers in your area? Where I live there's a woman who takes pictures and they always turn out beautiful, but she's very expensive. So, I would ask around to your friends and coworkers and see if there is anyone like that where you live and who they would recommend.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	This may seem cheap to you but I got some taken of Colten last Sunday at Wal-Mart, it's called the Picture Me Studio and she actually did a really good job! We get the pictures back March 2nd and I can show you if you want to see the results.<br>  <br>  We got him some pictures taken when he was about 4 months old at JcPenney's, they turned out pretty good, a lot more money then Wal-Mart and they at least have different backgrounds to choose from. At JcPenney they just had a plain white background :)|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yea we have gotten pretty much all our pics done at sears so far.<br>  Now this is only because we keep getting the coupons for the 4.99 packages which is a steal!<br>  As far as the service and whatnot I was not impressed.<br>  I took Ryan to  Kiddie Kandids ( dont know if you have them in your area)<br>  <br>  & the service was amazing a little more expensive but we got his birth announcements there!|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I always go to Picture Me studios at Wal-Mart. They are super-affordable. Having been there several times, it would take a lot for me to go somewhere else. I wish I had a scanner, because I would send you a copy of one of her portraits. Gorgeous! They also offer more specials if you make an appointment  (www.pictureme.com) Monday through Thursday before 4:30.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Hm, that's weird that the ones at Sears were not good! We used to get ours done there every time when the kids were little, and i loved them. Now, our neighbor is a photographer and we either go to her studio or to this creek, shes sooo good and super cheap! We love her! <br>  <br>  My daughter got hers done for her birthday one year at glamour shots, and they were beautiful- but oh so expensive! I have heard that Picture People, JC Penny's, and Studio One, is really good! Hopefully you have those where you live! <br>  <br>  -Lauren|`|eF6HTt0gaa	We get ours done thru the school picture day, other wise we take them ourselves. Its getting to pricy to go to a professional just like everywhere else.|`|eytlIKITaa	The Picture People are the best!|`|AA11109728	I tried Olan Mills once for my daughter's first Christmas pics.  I absolutely loved the way they came out, but I wasn't impressed with the way they did everything.  I couldn't see what the pics looked like beforehand, and they only had a certain number of photos for me when I went back to pick what I wanted, I basically couldn't get extras.  The lady didn't seem very professional, I mean as far as the pics, she was great, but she handwrote me a 'receipt', I didn't even get a real one, so all of that kinda turned me off.  That was more than 4 yrs. ago though, so things may have changed by now.  I'd look into it myself again to see.  The only other place I have done is Walmart.  As far as prices, they are great, you get a lot of pics in their advertised packages, and extras aren't ridiculously priced.  My daughter's pics usually turn out really nice there, you can see them as they are being done so you know what you are getting and you can order whatever you want.  There are also no sitting fees or anything like that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pictureme.com/cpi/en-US/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pictureme.com/cpi/en-US/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.olanmills.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.olanmills.com/</a>|`|FUOLr64jaa	There's a place here called Portrait Innovations and that's where I've had all Austin's pictures made.  They have a $9.95 package and you get a ton of pictures but it's only of one pose - and they take around 50-60 pictures so it's hard to pick one pose!  You can buy more than that but it can get a little pricey.  My favorite thing about them is that you come back and pick your pictures up in an hour!  You don't have to wait weeks - and it's nice to be able to show them off the next day!<br>  <br>  All that being said - I don't know if they are just local or everywhere.  If they have one in your area you might want to consider it!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Hey that calendar idea was great LOl!<br>  <br>  Well I went to Babies R Us once and they were so expensive but good with babies.<br>  I went to JC Penny and was not pleased at all!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I got my tax return today too!!! WOOHOO! lol<br>  I think Babies R Us i might go to again, only because they are trained for babies.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Picture People are great...no sitting fees but the costs per sheet are higher than Sears.  Sometimes their website offers a little coupon for a free 8x10 or 8 wallets or something along those lines.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	We're lucky my bro-in-law is a photographer on the side so he does ours for free. <br>  Everyone I know that's used Picture People has been really happy though!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	JcPenny's.  They do a good job and it is cheap.|`|pXSKSS3daa	My house, lol. :)<br>  <br>  Besides that I've only gone to Sears and wasn't pleased with their packages so we ended up buying individual sheets and that was a pain!<br>  <br>  I've heard good things about both The Picture People and Walmart, though.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I also did NOT like Sears. <br>  <br>  I actually like JC Penny's. They get some GREAT coupons and I think they did a great job when I took Riley for his 1st birthday pictures. I like the way that you can pic ANY picture for your free 8x10 and not just the same picture that you are already getting in a package. Sears doesn't let you do that.<br>  <br>  I also really really like Olan Mills but they are EXPENSIVE! I spent $185 on 6 sheets. It was ridiculous.<br>  <br>  <br>  I also want to go get a family picture done and I am going to go back to JC Penny's.
4ztXoIDKaa	I would send a "thinking of you" or "hang in there"  to someone that I was close to. BUt not get well soon.  That's a little odd.  But your right it's the thought that counts.|`|sk46uigvaa	I was diagnosed with PPD after my daughter was born, it was so bad i wouldn't leave the house for weeks on end, My Doctor always said to me she doesn't believe in PPD she believes in Post Natal shock!, with all the changes that motherhood brings as well as lack of sleep and recovering form the birth, it's no wonder we get run down!.<br>  <br>  in this situation a "get well soon" card is a little inappropriate as it's not really an 'illness' rather a state of mind.<br>  <br>  But atleast people are thinking of you.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel normal again soon! x|`|rmnvkIBXaa	maybe they just wanted to be thinking of you but didnt know what a good sentiment would be.  i would have just sent a thinking of you card, or maybe one with the dog with the big eyeballs that says something funny.|`|4Pa8TnLeaa	it could be misinterpreted in the wrong way .....<br>  but personally i think it doesnt really matter... you have someone willing to get you a card and let you know they are there for you|`|4HFmQSrzaa	I'd send a general, "Thinking of you..." type card , if any, to remind you that you're being thought about, and you're still loved, despite what is going on. Having a baby is a beautiful thing, but the emotional rollercoaster that follows is a tricky thing for a lot of women. It's important - even for those that do not have PPD - to know that they are loved, they are still important, and they haven't been left behind in all the baby related commotion. <br>   A "Get Well Soon" card does seem really insulting to me. That's like saying, "Hey, it's your fault - suck it up and get over it". If I got a card like that, I'd totally take it as an insult. It's like a slap in the face. Maybe I just take things too personally, though.  If you wouldn't send a card like that to someone with Bipolar Disorder, or any other mental health issues, PPD should have the same rule.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	I wouldn't. I'd send a congrats on your new baby card, but unless the mom was constantly crying and didn't want anything to do with the baby, the thought wouldn't cross my mind, in fact, in that scenario, I would be mad if she acted that way and wouldn't deserve a card. Maybe they were just being silly,|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I wouldn't, but I'm sure that person's heart was in the right place.  I agree with the person who said send a "thinking of you" card.  Better yet, I'd call and offer to do something to help.  If it was a good friend, I'd probably visit.  I know I got kind of lonely with my daughter once everyone had seen her and I was home all day taking care of her.|`|rhypzNW8aa	Proberbly the wrong type of card but your friend meant well,maybe she did'nt know what type of card to send you.Hope you feel better soon,i had ppd too so hope things get better for you soon and talk to your doc or health visitor if you have'nt done already x|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I would send a "I'm thinking of you" card instead.  Being a first time mom is hard enough, coping with PPD is hard!  Good luck!  I had PPD about 8 months after my son was born.  I didn't have anyone to help me out but my mom, she was a life saver!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That is a little weird to me.  I had a long distance friend with PPD recently.  I sent her an email with my cell phone number and said she could call any time day or night to talk. But a card seems...I don't know, it's not really a greeting card kind of thing.<br>  <br>  But I assume her heart is in the right place.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	No. Maybe a card that says congratulations and let her know you are there if she needs anything.....
LWXRVO5Haa	I would say NO|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I personally wouldn't, too much of a fire hazard.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	wax coated lungs arent fun|`|YsQQ30YJaa	I would advise against the practise. Many candles use lead in the wick<br>  There is also the hazard of starting a fire..|`|50iYxQ9Saa	I personally wouldn't but that's just because I worry about every little thing...I just don't think fire and a baby in the same room is smart.|`|vRvXvnRZaa	As long as it doesn't have fumes, perfumes or you don't burn the house down i don't see the harm.|`|hYQTOabRaa	I, personally, get a headache after about 30 - 60 minutes of burning candles without ventilation (fresh air circulation).  I don't believe the headache comes from the fragrance, but rather from the depletion of oxygen and more carbon dioxide in the air from the flames.  This could be particularly dangerous for somebody so little like a baby.  The baby would have no way to let you know he/she has a headache or is having trouble breathing except to cry - but then you may not realize that the candles might be the problem.  I would rather be safe then sorry.  Who knows maybe candles in an unventilated room is one of the mysterious reasons for SIDS. . .
b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Oh, that's annoying! Can you put the phone on silence? That way you could see on the caller id that someone is calling but you won't have to hear it. <br>  <br>  My family doesn't even have a home phone anymore. We have cell phone's because we're on the road a lot and there's no reason to have a home phone when everyone has a cell phone.|`|lzivF4Idaa	i hate it with a PASSION. it always wakes my son up. i dont even answer the house phone cuz i always see who's calling (it comes across the tv) and its always someone random. everyone knows to calll my cell!! which i can put on vibrate. ive come really close to just unplugging // breaking my house phones lol<br>  <br>  thanks for letting me get the anger out!|`|U7oJrc3faa	Yeah, I really like how I get my 8month old to FINALLY fall asleep, and then the house phone rings and wakes her up again....I usually turn the ringer off when I put her to sleep... People that need to talk to ME usually call my cell.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You know what I do for this problem... Turn off the ringer and let the answering machine get it...just make shure the answering machiene is turned down real low too!|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	Go to <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" rel="nofollow">https://www.donotcall.gov/</a> and sign up. You can add your land line as well as cell phone numbers, and it's free. It takes approximately thirty days to fully kick in, but it should stop soliciting calls. <br>  <br>  In our house, we have turned the ringer off of the house phone, but we keep our answering machine on at a low volume. We know that if anyone really needed to get a hold of us, they would call one of our cell phones.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	I wish i could get rid of my house phone, but unfornuately my 11 year old doesn't have (or even need) a cell phone right now, and he uses the house phone. So right when my twins go down for naps, the phone rings and they wake up! Makes me sooooo mad! And my daughter has stupid prank callers who like to call at 11 at night and say stupid stuff, and if we don't answer they keep calling and calling and calling! <br>  <br>  I hate my house phone.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I agree, also my little sister somehow changed the ring on our phone so its some crazy ringtone thing and its really loud. Its so annoying, and we can never find the phone in time to answer it, when you do its some person calling from overseas offering you a "free holiday"<br>  its so annoying :||`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I get the same calls all the time! It seems like they know when my son falls asleep. Yesterday we got 17 phone calls and none of them were friends or family. I am thinking about disconnecting it! <br>  <br>  Someone called a few months ago for a family member that has been dead for three years, I think he felt a little awkward because he said sorry and hung up.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I don't have a house phone because its a pain in the butt.<br>  I have a work phone, and personal fone, which I guess is like the house fone.|`|JivuAmfiaa	Oh my goodness, yes! Telemarketers ring up all day long and get this, a business from China rings up every day at exactly 6:06pm, every day! If it's not a telemarketer it will be my part-time boss complaining about something, she uses me as her own psychiatrist, going over every single problem in detail, grr, it drives me nuts! And on top of that my kids move it every day and my seven year old rings up random numbers and says the most inappropriate stuff, once we even got the police on our doorstep because of it. My five year old does that too, but in a different way, she types in a number like '123321' or something else that makes sense to her, and starts rambling on because she thinks it's her soft toy panda. As you can probably tell my kids have very vivid imaginations (or problems lol). I want to just smash the stupid thing against the wall sometimes.|`|VmGrypxVaa	Well, now a days more people are starting to quit using Home Telephones and only using Cell Phones. This stops Telemarketers, and it's harder to prank call people with Cell Phones because of the Exotic Area Code.<br>  <br>  But if you decide to stay with your house phone, wait until the end of the of the computerized person to end, and there will most likly tell you to " Press (2 or 3... Can be any number)  to be taken of our Calling List" and just press that number. <br>  <br>  If its a real person, tell them your not interested and ask to be taken of there calling list.<br>  <br>  You can also talk to your Telephone Company and ask them to change your telephone to Private for an extra fee. (You will still keep the same phone number, but much less telemarketers calling) + with a private telephone number, you can not receive Blocked Numbers.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I've recently had to upgrade my phone to where I can block upto 12 calls at a time. I interchange them and I love this feature now. It's annoying tho that I actually have 12 callers who wont give up calling me!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	it never fails huh?<br>  its like murphys law the baby falls asleep the stupid phone rings.  <br>  i've been contemplating getting rid of my house phone.  haven't made the big leap yet but a lot of people here say its the way to go.  could be an option for you to.
aJLx0nhNaa	My son had to spend the night in the nursery the day after we brought him home, because we needed to return him to the hospital for jaundice treatments.  It was not the NICU - just the normal nursery.  I was in there for a few hours that night and about an hour the next morning.  Every time a baby cried somebody picked him up.  They had two female volunteers there for this purpose.  They both spent their time sitting in a couple of rocking chairs with one baby or another.<br>  <br>  It was very reassuring.  While I was discussing my son's treatment with the nurse in charge she stopped a couple of times to tend to a baby that was fussing.  I can't speak for all hospitals, obviously.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I was too paranoid to let anyone take my daughter away from me for longer than she needed to be. I was angry enough when they brought her back to me with a pacifier in her mouth (her latch was terrible, and she was hungry so they just popped a pacifier in her mouth instead of bringing her back right away) I just wanted to be next to my child, I didnt' care if I got zero sleep...I'm still glad I did it that way.|`|68c6B8dRaa	We heard plenty of wailing from the stalls, I mean, plastic bassinets, they kept the babies in in the storage room, I mean, nursery, for the mercifully brief time we were in a maternity ward...<br>  <br>  I have no idea if all hospitals are like that, of course, but this, a purportedly modern deal with signs saying "X General: A Family-Friendly Hospital" all over the place, did not have anybody rushing to tend to crying. The nurses dealing with the babies were also dealing with the mothers, and the mothers were invariably the priority. We were quite weirded out by the little room of squalling infants a la 1950.|`|wMx9Z2gTaa	Insofar as they can, nurses comfort newborn babies in the nursery. Obviously, when they are taking care of multiple babies, they can do the amount of cuddling you would do. Given a choice, I would keep the baby with me. You'll want the comfort of holding her and will enjoy it almost as much as she does. It's also a chance to do a lot of bonding even before you go home.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	My daughter spent a little time in the nursery.  I had a really difficult labor and needed to rest.  She was brought to me everytime she fussed.  I was breast feeding at the time, so of course if she fussed, most likely it was due to hunger.<br>  <br>  EDIT: do you own thinking:  Your attempts at sarcism are not funny.  It's pathetic that you have to put down everything that goes against your way of parenting.  I've tried very hard to give you a chance to be a nice person, but apparently, I've been wasting my time.  You need help, you really do.  I hope your children don't grow up to be as stuck up and judgemental as you are.|`|lGSUToFQaa	i kept my son and daughter in the room with me at all times, i was afraid of that, i worked in a hospital for a while, and the baby's always cried in the nursery, and someone always grabbed a baby as soon as they cried, of course it was a big hospital and there were volunteers and nurses who always went in there on their breaks, to see the baby's.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I had planned on keeping my baby in the room with me, which I did for the most part, but the second night I went ahead and sent him to the nursery between 1am and 3am and between 4am and 6am.  When the nurse returned with our son the last time, she told us that she had just sat and rocked our little one almost the entire time he was in the nursery.  Of course we were at a very small hospital in a rural area and there were only 2 babies in the hospital at the time.  I don't know if they would do that if it was a busier hospital with more patients.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	My daughter was with me from the moment she came out, I don't think there was even the option to do otherwise. My mum was telling me horror stories about my eldest brother (born in 1965), when mothers were not allowed to keep their newborns with them, they were brought at 9pm for the last feed and then taken away until 4am! I'm pretty sure they must've been screaming all night and I greatly doubt anyone was attending to all (or any) of them........|`|OZ474DMYaa	I am sure they don't let them cry. Also like you said a lot of them are in with the mom's so they get taken care of by them. I know that I also asked about this while I was in the hospital and the nurses there told me that they hold and love those babies, no matter who's they are.|`|j7i6cY1vaa	I was very scared to let my son go and when I said ok go ahead so I could get some rest they took him in and they song to him and feed him also changed him they did so awsome my mother had told me what they did. The nurse also let me know everything and she even wrote it on his sheet! I really was blessed to have such a great Nurse to take care of my son while I got some rest!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	They comfort them, but not as quickly as you would your own.  In the NICU Laura was n a baby would cry for a few minutes and if the nurse was busy, they just cried for a few minutes until they could go to them.  They would give them a paci, swaddle them, hold them if necessary.|`|T1x5jnj1aa	Nope. I formula feed my babies so they didn't even have to bring them back for a feed!<br>  I slept throught the night!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I live in Australia and I have no idea if all Australian hospitals are like this but there was no nursery at the hospital where I had my son(now 22 months old). There was only an ICU. When my mum had my siblings and myself, there wa no nursery then either. When I had my son, the nurses immediately put the id band on him in front of me and I walked from the birthing suite whilst my partner carried my son to my room. I also had him in a public hospital (our health care system is more similar to Canada than the US) and even though I didn't ask/pay for a private room, I was in a room by myself. The nurses checked on me and my son. Checked our temps etc but pretty much left me alone. I had to ask for help with breastfeeding because I was having so much trouble getting him to latch on but I didn't really receive much help. I only stayed overnight because I felt so alone and wanted to be at home with my husband.
4HFmQSrzaa	One of my kids recently had two front teeth on top, two on bottom and two molars come in all at once. <br>  My other kid had the bottom front teeth first.  <br>  I have seen some babies that (oddly enough) end up with a full set of molars before any front teeth... <br>  He could be teething. Give him some frozen teething toys to chew on in order to save your fingers - one of these days you might get surprised with a tooth! Ouch!|`|gWiZAsfBaa	My sons front teeth came in first. According to all the research that I've done on teething, they all do say that the front teeth cuts in first.
373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Oh my god hun I am so sorry for your poor friend. Losing my baby at 19 weeks was bad enough but at term. I am almost crying just thinking of how she must feel right now.    I don't even know what to say other than what a brilliant friend you are to even think of putting off TTC to save her the heart ache. My best friend is 37 weeks pregnant, I love her to peices so I am happy to be around her but my god it does hurt.    It's totally up to you about what you want to do, you could speak to her about this in a few weeks, although she is going to say carry on TTC because that's what friends will do.    Just don't do anything that is going to upset you, you deserve a baby too xxx    Sorry to hear about your labour too! Wow I really took my first pregnancy and labour for granted. x  I|`|ZkweS1Zcaa	Your daughter mst be a fighter!  That's very lucky.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	I am not in the same but similar situation as my friend just miscarried at 12 weeks and I've been TTC.  Now i'm afraid of Getting pregnant b/c of her feelings and I've already had two children and no miscarriages and feel as though my time is coming.    You could always opt for a c-sec if you are that scared.   every pregnancy is different, so i wouldn't base any future ones off a past one.    Do what you heart tells you to do. Maybe wait till your friend heals and you can TTC together and be due at the same time. have a buddy to go through it with you.    Good luck|`|Xr99qmPGaa	maybe you should wait, be by your friends side, dont get pregnant yet, im sure you dont wan tot risk loosing her if she reacts different.|`|V49nP5ZHaa	Your friend really needs Your support at this moment of time it is really hard to lose a child after 9 months of Carrying them.  i understand that your so trying for a baby but i personally think you should give it some time before.  wait until she has calmed down and come to terms with the situation of her babies death.  when you do get pregnant you should tell her and ask for her opinions as both of you need to get on with your lives and there is no point in hiding the truth,  i understand it is hard but both of you need to be strong and do whats right for yourselves.  hope this helps. :D|`|IurAMoIDaa	just show them that you are there for support if they need it, as they will!    don't give up on your dream of having a second child!!!|`|1idd0Rl9aa	that is a very difficult situation. my husband and i are also ttc with our 3rd child.   did your friend know you have been ttc before the passing of her child? if yes, then i wouldn't see the problem with you continuing with your plans.  you can still support her and be there for her during a pregnancy.  anything can happen during pregnancy to anyone. sometimes even the healthiest people have the most problematic pregnancies and births. all you can do is your best. go to your doctor visits on time. go see your doctor if anything feels off. take your prenantal vitamins and just follow doctors orders.|`|e689cde0c9392593f9c414564377d6d9aa	What happened to your friend is horrible, but you can't let that stop you from trying to conceive. I'm sure she will be mroe than happy for you when you fall pregnant.     We have been trying for almsot 3 years now, and had IVF a few weeks ago. It was successful and we have our first scan in a couple fo weeks. I had to tell a friend that it had been successful, knowing that he and his partner have had 3 goes at IVF now, but he was over the moon for us.|`|zD2NWrIzaa	I wonder if this is happening because the midwife shortage, or because " they know best" and will not call the doctor, or perhaps the doctor is elsewhere and will not? want to be called out on the weekend or evening.  a78 hour labour should have been a Cesarean section earlier|`|B6kgnh0jaa	I haven't been through anything that devastating but i'm sorry for your friends loss. You should not worry or feel guilty if you conceive. You can still be there for your friend and maybe you having a baby will help her through her loss. You can be there for each other and it may give her the courage to try again.
0qP8gLpyaa	My son did this from birth until he was about 3 months old.  He wasn't fussy if it was wet or dirty but the minute we went to take the dirty off to put on a clean one he would cry and carry on as if the world were coming to an end. It was heart wrenching and horrible. The minute the clean one was on and we picked him up he'd stop nearly instantly. I never could figure out why.  The only thing I could figure was he didn't like being lifted up and the waist to change because it may have made him feel insecure. When he was about 3 months old I stopped using the changer for awhile and would just slip a pad on my bed and change him there and it seemed to help. I think it was more comfortable for him and he didn't feel like he was going to fall (even though I had the strap around his waist and was right there the whole time).   <br>  I wouldn't worry. I think some kids are just like that.|`|AA11388527	Make sure she feels safe and comfortable when you change him.  She'll outgrow it.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Try giving her something to play with while you change her.  It was around 7 months that my baby started getting impatient and didn't want to lay there and get her diaper changed anymore.  She would scream!  Also, try a wipes warmer.  It makes a big difference for us!|`|4ztXoIDKaa	My daughter is the complete opposite, she is so happy during diaper changing time.  All smiles,  I wonder why, as soon as we lay her on her changing mat.  All babies are different.|`|J6JFiNL8aa	scared and hurting possibly|`|cv0foxlTaa	Perhaps she is cold?|`|cn91FeWcaa	a lot of babies do that... i think its because they may have some irritation ...or notices that they are wet or dirty and dont want it on them...or because they dont want to sit still for it|`|o5piRiBsaa	I think it's like baths... some babies just hate it, while others don't.  My son for whatever reason adores having his diaper changed, and will smile and laugh while it's being done.  Why?  No clue.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My little guy was like that too.  We got a wipe warmer and a cloth cover for the changing table and he stopped crying after that.
LXherojjaa	hey alex it's josh which in case i am voting for josh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|7ufheV16aa	Both are cute (and sexy).

Andrew sounds sexier overall though.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Andy sounds like a mans name - where as Josh sounds more teenager-y and cute.

H2ZMDc4Iaa	Food doesnt replace formula or milk. It's kind of a learning substitute for when they begin to self feed, and eventually eat adult food. She still needs the same amount of formula, because its the only thing that givers her the nutritional value she needs on a daily basis. The only other thing thats nearly equal to formula is rice or oatmeal cereal mixed with formula.<br>  <br>  My daughter has 2 jars of 2nds foods each day, but the same amount of formula she's had since 4 months. She's now 7 months old as of this week.|`|hYQTOabRaa	Suckling, whether breast or bottle, is naturally comforting so that is going to be what she prefers.  However, in doing the process she is filling up on milk and that is why she would prefer no to eat food.  Eating food is more work.  Now would be a good time to introduce her to a sippy cup.  Allow her to still have her milk in her bottle.  When you find out how much she should have in a day, limit her to just that much.  If she is on formula does it say on the can?  (I breast fed, so I don't know).  Take her to the store and let her pick out her favorite cup.  Then give her her juice and water in her cup, not her bottle.  When she turns one (or whenever you as her mother thinks she is ready) and is done with formula get rid of the bottles.  Do it together and make it fun.  Throw them away or pass them on to a younger relative or thift store.  Get her excited about giving them to baby's who need them, she's a big girl who has a cup now.  If you wait any longer it gets harder.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	Breastmilk should be the primary source of nutrients for all children under age one.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you are not talking about breastmilk than what do you mean by "milk" Do you mean formula? I hope you aren't talking about cows milk.<br>  I was only trying to be helpful.<br>  <br>  Trust me dear. I know that anything I may say in my answer can't make you feel guilty.
IXBl5l5kaa	Oh my Gosh... I feel your pain exactly. My daughter had a horrible day a couple of weeks ago to where our current DCP told us she would terminate us if she acted the same way again... she cried for 5 hours straight!<br>  <br>  Last night started up really bad and no amount of medicine or tablets helped. We had a rough sleep and today she cried almost the whole day. I was trying to get ready for work and I put her in her crib... I had to go get her because she was gagging. When I walked in the room she had a HUGE string of mucous hanging from her mouth she had been crying so badly! When I would walk to the kitchen she would start bawling and follow me in there.<br>  <br>  I told our DCP how she was acting today and that my husband was on stand-by in case he needed to leave work and get her. We hoped she would do good but after an hour my hubby had to leave work and pick her up. She sat in my lap most of the day, when I wasn't busy, and played with my keys or the remote. Otherwise she was miserable.<br>  <br>  These days really come and go and usually it lasts alllll day long. Sometimes it'll last a couple of days. My daughter got her first tooth at 6 months. She is now 7 months and 2 weeks old and has 4 teeth PLUS another top tooth coming it. It's insane!<br>  <br>  I hope my husband is doing ok with her! I just wanna get some sleeeeeeeep tonight!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ***If she acts the same way tomorrow I'm gonna give the doc a call just to cover myself. The DCP seems to think she has thrush but I never noticed anything and my nipples feel fine lol|`|oUtEVKDHaa	I have no idea my baby is the same way. cries and cries day and night... i wish there was a magical way to stop their pain and make them happy!!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby was teething for about 6 months, and finally cut her first teeth at 10 months.  The thing that works best for her is a frozen wash cloth.  Wet a baby washcloth, and ball it up and put it in a baggie.  Put it in the freezer.  She loves to chew on them because they are soft and they last for hours.  As the outer layer becomes thawed, it will just get soft and she can chew on the next layer.  I'd keep 2 or 3 of them in the freezer at a time.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My son was the same way.  It usually lasted about a week.  I complained so much to my MD that they wrote me a prescription for something called paragoric-a derivative of morphine basically.  My son would get 4 teeth at a time.  Good luck!|`|4HFmQSrzaa	My first had a very rough time teething. He would stay awake for 2-3 days at a time just screaming and screaming. <br>  The last baby, we were a bit smarter about. ;) We stocked up on Oragel to help numb her gums -- which makes a massive difference. <br>  Try giving the baby a frozen/cooled teething toy, or a mesh bag with bits of frozen fruit to chew on (remember, make sure the mesh is really, really small so the fruit doesn't become a choking hazard. You should be able to find the little mesh bags at most stores -- Toys R us, Sears, Zellers, etc). <br>  The runny nose is normal - pushing new teeth through is A LOT of work, and sometimes has a negative effect on the sinuses. A stuffy nose is okay - as long as she is breathing properly, you have no reason to unclog it. The snot will not harm her. Try putting a vaporozier/humidifier in her room to help keep it softer so she can clear it out easier on her own. <br>  You sound like you are doing your best -- which is awesome! It's hard as a mom to realize that sometimes, the best isn't enough to make it okay. :/ This is a rough time, but also good - she is going to learn how to cope a bit on her own, and you're going to learn that sometimes, as hard as it is, you've gotta let her work her own way through whatever the situation is. It's practice for later. ;) <br>  If it starts to affect her sleep, or her eating, make sure you get her back into the doctor. Remember to make sure she is taking in enough fluids - even try pushing a bit more, because if a fever is present, it can cause dehydration faster than normal. Even ask the doctor about using Children's Tylenol to help ease her pain. <br>  She's going to be teething for a while -- my 3 year old is finally getting the last molars in, and his days/nights are still a little rough. But for the most part, it does get A LOT easier. <br>  Give your little baby lots of hugs and cuddles, let her know she's okay...and remind yourself that she IS okay, and she will be just fine. :) <br>  Best of luck.
703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I'd say one little glass of wine is fine.  To be more careful, drink it right after a feeding so it has a little while to leave your milk before the next one.  I wouldn't worry about pumping and dumping unless you have more than two.  A friend who is a certified lactation educator told me that alcohol leaves a mom's milk like it does your blood, and doesn't require pumping--only time.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I had wine, beer, etc only one glass at a time when I was breastfeeding and my daughter never got drunk or suffered at all from it.  I did pump and dump once at a friend's house.  I never drink more than a glass or two of anything on my own, but she kept refilling my wine glass and before I knew it...  :-)  But I wouldn't worry too much about one glass.<br>  <br>  And as a sidenote, a beer with lots of hops in it is one way a lot of moms try to boost their milk supply.|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	yes i do it all the time. its not gonna kill the baby. he's not attached anymore so don't worry about it|`|AA11348933	Yes you can, in moderation.

OFToxXGZaa	My first  c-sar was fine but my second!! Wow it was bad! Yes I was in absolute agony afterwards. It wasn't a constant pain and it is kind of hard to explain but occasionally when I would walk or maybe just turn the wrong way or something I would get like a tearing feeling. It felt like the muscle had been stitched in the wrong place or something and I was tearing it away. Its so hard to explain but oh god it was excruciating! I would cry and it happened up until my baby was about 4ish months. I also got a hernia because I picked up my first child 1 day after my c-sar - I mean come on who isn't going to pick up their child?! Anyway yes I obviously had a different pain to you but I did have pain. I am 15 months post op now and I am still numb over my incision. Sometimes the numbness spreads upwards a little bit but it doesn't worry me. Erk I dread ever having another c-sar cause my second was so bad!!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Your pain should slowly be going away a little more every day. If you feel like not much has changed, or if you aren't sure what's happening, call your doctor. They might want to see you before your regularly scheduled postpartum appointment.|`|627pWyVkaa	Have never had this, But I can tell you just from what you said, it hurts because you shouldn't be bending over and picking up your baby already! I know your home by yourself but you may want to try and get someone to help you for a little bit otherwise your going to take even longer to heal! I would have your doctor check this out, I know you go in at 6weeks. But I doubt you would fully be healed at 2 weeks, Because the incision goes very deep through many layers of skin, and doing activities that your doing, you probably undid most of the healing that had started to happen|`|0l7pyBSTaa	yes it is possible to rip on the inside and not notice a thing on the outside, you REALLY need to go to the doctors and tell them this, you could be bleeding internally, and in the end that could result in death, it's nothing to wait on....go to the doctors, please...|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Recovery takes time.  I had a c-section also and some days the pain was worse than others.  You should have another appt. set up to see your doctor and I would ask to move it up or wait it out.
wrUsMG4Jaa	The words "normal" and "sane" should never be used in cases which ANYONE murders another human being. They have an improper definition behind them, and shouldn't be considered in any case.    I don't think there is any type of "cold blooded murderer", or that insanity give anyone the right to take someone elses life. I believe that there are people who do things that are entirely within their nature.    Ted Bundy appeared normal and had a relatively uneventful childhood, but a psychiatric evaluation of his post-"insanity" would reveal someone with a homicidal tendency towards women.  The same follows for EVERY 'cold blooded killer' out there.    A mother that kills her child/ren has ALWAYS shown a tendency that would lead a professional to make an educated guess that it would happen in the future.     Its the same deal every time. When a mother kills her child/ren the weeks that led up to it are generally: "She seemed withdrawn". "She had been struggling with some depression", "Her work ethic improved", so on and so forth.    Then out of "no where" her entire home is taped off with yellow cautionary paper and the police are carrying out body bags and the mother is either dead or in handcuffs- either way she looks entirely normal.    Most people that say "I can't imagine the thought coming to my mind" will NEVER have that thought. The people that WILL have that thought are people who have suffered from depression before, whom have difficulties with commitments, and have difficulties with repetitive natures.     Years ago it was happening as much as it was today. We just have more routes to find out about these things. No matter if it happens in a town with a population of 2000, or a city with 20 thousand, NBC, CBC, ABC, and FOX will have it on the morning and evening news 12 hours after the details are released. Years ago, it would be on the local news and it would die away. Today, 20 minutes after it happens, the WORLD knows.|`|ErnyFjVdaa	Who really knows what goes through their mind.It could be the time we're living in.Everything is getting worse,including some people.GOD help us all.Take care and have a good evening.|`|AA10811784	I know what you mean!

It's just so sickening and unimaginable. How could ANYONE do such a thing!?|`|6j8d7TZTaa	Some people cat handle the responsibilities like they thought they could.  Some are just plain murderers just for so called fun as they think it is.  Some just want attention.

You hear of it now because that is the way society is today they air everything.   You didn't hear about it so often previously because it was taboo and swept under the rug.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Seems there is just so much more mental illness. I often think that we never heard about all this crazy stuff years ago. Is it because there are more sick people or just better reporters? Sometimes I think all this madness is an indicator of something. I just am not sure what. The people who loaded their children into the car driving them to another state to legally "dump" them, what are they thinking? Awful. All of it. Just awful|`|8Y583Fluaa	no mental disabilities are a excuse..many times over they do it cuz they dont like be strung down and they still want the party life of a single person or they like a guy who dont want children...then they get caught and scream mental..in all actuality they are evil  EDIT: im sick of the mental illness excuse..if they were mental and not knowing what they were doing they wouldnt be trying to lie about it or cover it up..they know right from wrong  Edit again: dudemaster is sick and must have a small peepee himself|`|lGKq9NXbaa	in their minds they're saving them from something, maybe the cruelty of the world.

Maybe they are suicidal themselves but know their children will suffer for the rest of their lives if they survive her - just a guess.

It is strange though, because the normal instinct of a mother would be to protect her child...|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	This is not new.

I'd say it is mostly from mental disorders, but I just don't know.    As to why we hear so much of it...  It's not happening any more than it did decades ago - it just wasn't news then.  No-one spoke about it when these things happen, women were just shut away in mental institutions and forgotten.  Sadly, in this modern world these terrible stories are apparently news-worthy.  There seems to be a morbid fascination with this kind of horror.|`|AA11267193	It is tragic and sickening, but who can really say why?

The act is totally against a mother's nature.|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	This is what happens when God is taken out of everything!|`|eDySIDPQaa	Cold blooded murderers    They see themselves as being saddled down,  can't do what they use to do..........clinical name is   Cold Blooded Murderers....    They would have never told about it in the old days, the mother would have been deemed as possessed or a witch of sorts.....    The later years, they just locked them up in looney bins and forgot them, but they cant do that now, the media stops that.    I cant even imagine killing a child or anything...I dont know how they can have 5-6 children and stand there and kill them all.....it breaks a persons heart to hear of this
4g4K41t1aa	This may not be what you are dealing with, but when my daughter was 4 months old i was CONVINCED she was teething because she would cry for hours at night and up until then had been sleeping thru the night no problem. I did everything i could as far as trying to reduce teething pain but nothing seemed to work. Eventually after about a week of holding her while she screamed for hours EVERY night, we finally decided to try putting her on a regular schedule with a regular bedtime (genius, i know.) <br>  <br>  It was sooooo hard at first, but we decided to try the cry-it-out method and honestly it was probably the hardest thing i have ever had to do, but within 2 days she was going to bed totally on her own with no problem. We let her cry for 5 minutes, then went and held her, soothed her, and put her back to bed, waited another 10 minutes, didnt pick her up but soothed her, waited another 15 minutes and she was usually asleep by the end of the last 15 minutes. We did this at every nap and at bedtime, and she adjusted to it super well after about 2 days. She has been sleeping thru the night again ever since.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I dont know if your baby is teething or not, but like i said, i was convinced mine was (she didnt get her first tooth until she was 9mo btw) and it turned out to just be a schedule problem. Good luck, i know how hard it can be!!|`|wMx9Z2gTaa	First, as a mom and grandmother who has taken care of a lot of babies I will respectfully disagree with your pediatrician. Some babies fly through teething with no apparent discomfort. Other babies are clearly uncomfortable and fussy. You can even see reddened, swollen areas on their gums. They can develop slight fevers and even diarrhea because they are upset by the process. It is entirely possible that she is teething. Some babies are even born with a few teeth that have already erupted. The information on when to expect your baby to begin teething is based on averages. My daughter, for example, got her teeth very early--started teething at 3 months--and had all of her two year teeth by the end of her first year.<br>  <br>  Some baby Tylenol before bedtime may help your baby sleep better. Also, a teaspoon chilled in the fridge (not the freezer) can be used to massage her gums--simply rub any inflamed areas of the gums with the back of the bowl of the spoon. Teething toys can help, too. <br>  <br>  Good luck. If you can, nap yourself when your baby sleeps. This will help you get through the long rough nights. Remember, too, if your baby starts teething earlier, the process will be over sooner.|`|AA10965418	I'd watch and see if she continues to have crying spells when nothing is wrong (she's been fed, changed, etc.). Consider colic at that point. They have some new teething ointment for nighttime. Might want to look into that and a swing. THEY ARE LIFE SAVERS!!! Get a teething ring that you can put in the freezer, you know the ones with liquid in them. Good luck.
8WbfmK5daa	Yeah its something to do with the blood flow around the area. Some women even get that when they are on their period too.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	same thing is happening with me!<br>  i'm sorry i don't have the answer but i'm going to keep checking back to see what everyone else has to say about it|`|qYvDpa6daa	same thing happend to me, i went to the doctors about it, she told me that it was because i wasnt producing enough vaginal lubricant so it made things dry and it was friction that was causing it to hurt on my lips. id be fine during intercourse and then towards the end it would start to hurt a bit and when we finish it would sting like mad and would get worse if i went to the toilet afterwards. my advice would be to use extra lubricant but DONT use flavoured ones it dosnt help with the soreness or stinging lol. good luck hope this helps|`|4ZQxAvE2aa	I don't know the medical reason for it, but I'm sure its normal. I am 33 weeks pregnant and it happens to me every time my boyfriend and I have sex.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Yeah, i get that too, even after going to the toilet! It's normal.|`|VHgfWPS2aa	It's from a huge amount of blood flow to that area, Its normal<br>  EDIT : For me it almost feels like my labia are going to fall off ! lol|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Don't feel stupid-it's a good question. There could be lots of answers to your question. One possible reason could be the amount of blood flow to that area. A lot of blood flow shifts to the area to protect the baby and when you have sex that also shifts blood flow (for stimulation) to the same area. Also you can get infections easier when your pregnant-check to see if you have one next appointment. Your probably are just extra sensitive right now; )
AA11282101	yes if you have certian risk factors but not always... they were probably braxton hicks but if they intensify or get closer together then you would want to get ahold of you ob/gyn|`|p5wzfp4Faa	they say nipple stimulation can bring on pregnancy, but like all things most never work. you really shouldnt try out your breast pump as the milk is not ready yet|`|KQU5y20waa	YES....it can.|`|9cu82009aa	They say it can, but I've 'expressed' my colostrum out with all my pregnancies (except the first as it didn't come in) because they get really itchy, and my second and third were overdue yet my first was early. My forth I got induced @ 39wks.
CrmCHVI0aa	she needs to tell her mum!!! even though you made a promise this is your friends health at risk here. someone needs to know so either she does it or you do.|`|RjoCYCkQaa	My biggest fear for you is that the baby may turn out retarded from all the pills. Trust me! You DO NOT WANT A RETARD BABY!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You are NOT helping her by asking this question. If you were a good friend you would tell someone about this. I can promise you that she will thank you in the long run.<br>  <br>  I hope this is just a fake question. I see on your profile that all your questions and answers are private (which usually mean that person like to post ridiculous questions to get people riled up) But if not, I beg you tell someone. If you don't you are only accomplice to her abuse.|`|0jpep8S9aa	Why does she need BC fast? If she's already pregnant... it's beyond that. Otherwise, it's going to end soon anyway. Her mom probably isn't taking them, plus she'd notice if there were any missing anyway.|`|kw80YHMLaa	WOW this is awful a gp cannot tell anything said in confidence but he/she might refer her for counselling. sorry i dont understand the birth control question|`|uJFXbHA7aa	A real friend would call the cops, regardless of your friends wishes.<br>  <br>  The sooner you call the cops, the sooner your friends pain will end.|`|p5wzfp4Faa	this is awful, you really need 2 get her 2 tell her mum. gp cant say anything to anyone.
VXCCjdZhaa	I only wish my mother had been as thoughtful as you. It would have been way less traumatic for her to do my teacher than for me to have anxiety about math credits. You are a good woman, and you best believe if my daughter struggles with math I will throw down.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	Giiiirl, I would TOTALLY take on for the team for my daughter.  ESPECIALLY if it was in algebra.  And just think, when you see her walk across the state to get her diploma, you can think yourself!      I'm being serious when I say that there is no harm in helping your daughter get that A.|`|AA12059817	If you sleep with her teacher in 8th grade, what will you do for grade 9-12???? when she flunks all the other math classes because she has no clue how to do it?|`|prqrQcd1aa	WOW, okay i'm going to say all this in a very non judgemental way here.    First off why degrade YOURSELF just in order to get your child a better grade in math? Have you tried helping you herself with it, or getting her a tutor?     Honestly maybe she is just not grasping it enough and needs to just go ahead and flunk it this year and then take it again next year. I funcked algebra 2 the first year i took it because of not doing homework, i was getting good grades on tests, but simply didn't want to do the homework every day. Is this what is going on with your child?    What ever the reason for her flunking, she should either get a tutor, or else just take it over again next year. I mean come on, how would you feel if you did sleep with this man, thinking it was going to get your daughter a better grade, and then find out that he still gives her the same grade?     I think you'd feel pretty used and helpless at that point, not to mention foolish. Make your daughter earn what she gets the right way... I mean how would you feel if your daughter was to grow up and do the same thing, or worse yet... think that if she slept with the teacher..(if he was a perv) that she would get a good grade. I think if you heard she had done something like this you'd be outraged...     Think also how she would feel about you if she found out you did this just to get her a better grade, do you think she may take it as she needs to sleep with people in order to get ahead in life? I think she would and i know as a mother you wouldn't like the idea that you had put it into her head by doing this!|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	It probably is not ethical and definitely is NOT moral. And you would teach your daughter such IMMORALITY in order to get her a passing grade?  Is she flunking algebra because she can't handle the course or because her teacher is setting her up to fail? Get her a tutor or get her in a different class where she can show what her capabilities are.    What you are considering is either fornication or adultery. What "gray line"???  .  Seems if you are willing to do what you are considering, then you are teaching your daughter that she can "sleep around" with guys as long as she gets some "benefit". But what about the loss of her integrity and all?  .|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes it's WRONG! And I hope your not teaching your daughter YOUR Bad Habits! Next thing the teacher will want to do is sleep with your Daugther to KEEP Her grades Up. Then what?|`|IizPFrELaa	lmfao you got these people riled!!!    I agree with ChaCha, throw down hun!|`|PRzmwFfgaa	You're daughter is only in 8th grade which means that you will have to sleep with at least 4 more teachers after this one to get her to graduate high school.  Hopefully they are all men!  I don't know what you are going to do if and when she goes off to college.  You said that you are willing to do anything for your daughter.  Well you better start looking into different tutoring programs and get your daughter some help.  What are you going to do if you do decide to sleep with him and he wants it again and again?  You may now be forced to continue to sleep with this man who you aren't even remotely interested in.  You do realize that if you don't continue you run the risk of her still failing, or him embarrassing her by making the face that you have prostituted yourself known to her.  Be a women that you would want your daughter to grow up to be.|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	i'm failing history class, can you do anything for me?  lol|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I don't see anything wrong with dating the teacher if that's what you want; however, don't you want your daughter to actually LEARN?? why not sit with her and go over this stuff.  It's only cheating your daughter if you 'buy' her grade.|`|dXMdt3gVaa	Lol youre hysterical! You cant possibly be serious! Havnt you heard of sylvan or kumon? ha ha :)|`|nPfCmp2Faa	maybe you should get your daughter a tutor or something.  its not really fair for her or anyone else if she passes algebra but didn't earn it.|`|3FaosgzZaa	Yes if anything you should look in to getting your daughter a tutor. Things like that only lead to grief|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Or you could just get her a tutor. That way she learns and achieves a good grade on her own merit.  Alternatively, sleep with her teacher and hope the sex is so great for him, that he rewards you by giving your daughter a good grade. Then hope she never finds out because she may think that having sex with teachers to succeed in class is acceptable and may end up trying to do so herself in a few years time. Such an ethical and moral dilemma isn't it?  Lol, you are making this up aren't you?|`|m53cNF4iaa	Even if you did he might just flunk your daughter instead men like to do time pass with girls i can never trust them you dont know what is up their sleeves|`|4JgSq2rlaa	ur sad and cheap|`|lAyQqRVjaa	No, its absolutely right and u should do it more often. You are taking an action for a service in order to get ahead or to get someone else ahead so its okay to do it.|`|y0Z8AtRuaa	oh mi word... i have nothing to say... how could this thought even cross your mind? what sort of message are you sending your daughter? ( and dont tell me she wont know - because she will grow up one day and learn what a cheap shot you made)    re-think your stupidity!|`|99ML0m2yaa	Its so wrong in so many ways...and what will you daughter do if she or her friends find out?  Maybe talk to him and ask him to help her out a bit more or get her a tutor.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	As a mother I am shocked and appalled at your question... Would you want your daughter to spread her legs for a good grade? I pray your answer is no!     Hire a tutor, contact her school, many high school students offer tutoring for kids free of charge for community service.     You want moral support? May I ask where your morals are? What is morally right about spreading your legs with a man you care nothing about, have no desire to be with, for a good grade for your child? Where are the morals in that? The moral thing to do is work with your daughter, get her help, she will need to understand this throughout the rest of her education! Are you going to spread your legs for each one of her math teachers?    I really think you should think this over and hopefully take the time you would be lending to her math teacher to get her a good grade, and help her in math, help her to understand, guide her, and show her hard work will get you places in life.|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	I'm sorry, I just had the scene from Forrest Gump flash through my mind. You know, where his mother sleeps with the principle just to get him into a normal school?     It's not a good idea. Not at all. I understand that you want to help your daughter succeed but this is not the way to go about it. Go to your daughters school and ask the principle if there is anyway you can get your daughter into a tutoring program. Or look into places like Sylvan. Ask your family or friends if they know of anyone who is good in math and can help your daughter out.     Sleeping with your daughters teacher is such a bad idea. She sees that she's gotten an A or a B and thinks she's doing so well. What happens when she passes on to next year and she's not prepared for the next level of math required? Are you going to sleep with that teacher, too? You can't follow your daughter around in life and sleep with everyone just to get her ahead. She's going to have to learn to do it on her own and what you have to do as her mother is provide help (such as tutors) and support the best you can.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Given the current economy, sadly, a single roll in the hay will not score you any higher than a C, if she's really in the tank.    You may actually have to be his girlfriend at family functions for an A.|`|Hur2XgWXaa	Please don't do this. It really ISNT ethical and If your daughter is FAILING, help her out or get a tutor for her. She can do it. This is downright just wrong. What would your daughter think when and if she found out?|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	i would say yes but you might have to sleep with her math teachers once she gets into High School, will you be ready for that too?|`|jENl8y24aa	I just hope you're a better lay than she is.|`|jVOapeKVaa	Lol, well look at it this way. Is it wrong when a hot teacher sleeps with a teenage boy and only gets a slap on the wrist as punishment, but if an unattractive teacher sleeps with a teenage boy she is punished to the full extent of the law. The same goes if ANY guy sleeps with a teenage girl. So the fact that your hot and this teacher is not, doesn't have to do with any of you being students but at the same time IS helping a student (your daughter) means that your well within your rights. So morals dont even come into play. So Houston you have lift off. What a lucky guy lol.|`|UHvuGAoOaa	WTH! why would you sleep with someone to help your daughter get good grade.. Your a mother act like one. What kind an example are you setting for your kids? If she weak in math then take her to a tutor.|`|pUotszNYaa	Okay, I'm only 17 so my opinion probably won't matter much, but seriously, are you even considering this? Let me tell you, sleeping with the teacher is not an option and just because you are not married doesn't mean that you are allowed to have sex with a stranger for personal gain. Can you imagine what your daughter would feel like if she ever found out about this?I'm sure that she'd rather fail in all of her subjects than see you with her teacher in this way. Heck, she might even stop going to school! Not to mention that you will be setting a very poor example for her. As a concerned mother you should be worried about her grades, but this is not an option. What if he doesn't pass her say, after you do sleep with him?  Please don't do anything that you might regret doing later, or worse that would hurt your daughter.   Ask a family member or friend to help her out in Algebra. or like the others said, if it's not too expensive and you can afford it, then hire a math tutor.|`|OYG711kraa	So wrong, for so many reasons!    You need to be demonstrating for your daughter the value of hard work and perseverance, not the "value" of devaluing her (or in this case your) body for personal gain!    What if it works?  What will you do when she has a hard time with another class?  What if that teacher is married?      I really hope you're not serious, and that you don't do it.  It's a lose-lose all around.|`|9NbREHCgaa	if thats what you want to teach your daughter: "its ok if you are doing bad.. just sleep with the higher ups"... ummmm NO!|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	Isn't that sort of like prostitution? Schools do have after school tutors, you know. But if you feel it's necessary, go for it. She's in eighth grade now. Maybe next year she'll remember the lesson you taught her and follow that good example for ALL of her grades!! Great role model.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Sex for grades.  When I boil it down to it's pure form for you, does it become less of a gray line?  Just in case you're still confused, IT'S WRONG, DON'T DO IT!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's nice to know that you don't really care whether or not your daughter truly needs help in the subject; just that's there's a way to get her to pass without doing anything to improve her grade. What a responsible parent you are!    What if she starts failing other subjects? You're going to have your work cut out for you.     Call Sylvan Learning Centers, for God's sake.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	you'll be doing your daughter no favors.  Hire a tutor for your daughter instead.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Well Math instruction tends to be cumulative.  Before you sleep with the 8th grade Algebra teacher, you should be prepared to sleep with her 9th - 12th grade math teachers also.  If there's a real ugly one or female amongst the lot you may want to reconsider unless you're into that sort of thing.

FHT6wsUpaa	My mom had a friend from MA who made my brother and I special tooth fairy pillows. They were heart-shaped with little pockets on the front, and small enough to put under a bed pillow. We would put our teeth in the little pocket, and in the morning when we woke up, we'd find a dollar!<br>  <br>  Years later, when the "truth" about the tooth fairy was revealed, mom showed us she had in fact saved every tooth we ever lost. Kind of gross, but sentimental I guess for her. :)|`|SxoDVgQ3aa	i used to cry cos i didnt want the tooth fairy to"steal" my tooth<br>  so i wrote her a note asking to keep it|`|eMSv7RwYaa	haha! when i was younger i put a square of tissue under my pillow,of course i told my parents my plan and when i woke up i found 20p! i was so happy about tricking the tooth fairy and me and my parents when on about it for years about how she must have been the "dopey fairy" haha!

I also would rather the nickname Mika and yes you can use Mika if spelt Michaela.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I like the name Mikayla and prefer that spelling as it looks less masculine and not just like "Micheal with an A on the end".  I dont really like the nicknames for it you've mentioned though personally, I like Mickey though.  A person can use whatever nickname they like!|`|dK6YGyNyaa	I think Mikayla looks and sounds quite chavy from a British perspective, but if you do use it, I'd spell it Michaela.

I prefer the more traditional Michaela, shortening it to Kayla :)|`|y9TVkzQYaa	Okay..so im not british but....I like the spelling Mikayla.  I like the nickname Kayla better.|`|8bbc7a133643da63ae7caf30623bdc4caa	I would use traditional spelling Michaela....and yes you can still use nickname Mika :) <br>  <br>  good luck|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Uhm I guess it'd be abit odd giving a child the nickname 'Mika' when their names 'Michaela' so if you wanted that nickname really you'd have to spell it 'Mikayla'.<br>  <br>  I do however hate the name Michaela spelt Mikayla BUT I hate the way Michaela is spelt too because I think it looks masculine.<br>  <br>  Makaela looks better I think.

jCvdW3WGaa	OMG yes, but not bad ones, just really bizarre and surreal.<br>  <br>  I dreamt I went to Narnia and a white horse proposed to me because it thought I was the reincarnation of June Carter!<br>  <br>  The bad dreams are usually just your fears being played out in your mind.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I have read alot about it and I guess it shows that you are thinking so much of how you want your baby to be healthy.<br>  <br>  Almost every night I dream that i am dying in some different manner and while people are tying to save me I am screaming, "Save the baby, save the baby."<br>  <br>  Either one of those dreams, or I'm dreaming that I am watching my miscarriage I had last year.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, its normal, I have crazy dreams like that all the time, they always have to do with something going wrong with the baby.  I think its just because we're moms now and we worry more.  After a dream like that I can't WAIT to go to a checkup so they can tell me everything is okay.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	i am 24 weeks pregnant and i have those same dreams. its just your fear of something being wrong with the baby. its actually normal to have bad dreams because of the hormone level or you can have repressed memories re appear. its normal. if you feel something is wrong with the baby contact your doctor|`|6M6XhKDKaa	no i think its normal u just need to relax everything will be OK. ;)|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	naw baby is fine , weird dreams is waht we all have . i hate them lol <br>  i dreamed my 20 month old girl got out side by her self and got lost in the deep snow i was scared !!|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I had lots of weird dreams at the beginning of my pregnancy with my son (who did have a lot of things wrong with him in real life), but there was not a baby in any of my dreams - except for one that was so sweet and calming - before we knew he was a boy, I dreamed of a girl that we brought home, and she was healthy.  (I have hopes that maybe that was a predicitive dream for the future yet. I have dreampt predictive dreams for other peoples' babies - not my own. I dreampt of my three year old niece two and a half years before she was born, for instance.)<br>  <br>  So, I never dreamed of our son's problems, even after we knew about them.   So perhaps because you are dreaming things are wrong with the baby, your baby will be fine!   That's what I hope for you.    <br>  <br>  Since our son passed away, I have dreampt of him only twice. Both in which he was suddenly better - in the first one, I got to hold him and hear him cry, and the second in which he was still a little baby, but could talk and told me he loves me and he knew I needed to see him again.   It was so, so sweet, and bittersweet at the same time.
HSUfe3m7aa	No it isn't. Binging is not eating for a period of time and then gorging yourself. You know this way of eating isn't healthy. You should stop before your metabolism gets too screwed up. There is no reason not to eat for 3 days, you should be eating every 3 hours.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	your not eatting enought kid!!!.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	wtf is wrong with you..are you tryna look like them<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heykool-aid.com/anorexic2pl.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.heykool-aid.com/anorexic2pl.j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://fc49.deviantart.com/fs18/f/2007/134/2/5/Anorexic_by_PreoSmo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fc49.deviantart.com/fs18/f/2007/1...</a>|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	It's starvation.

8e5YBwd7aa	Shes obviously just jealous!<br>  "Skinny skank" :Doesn't that not sound Jealous to you?<br>  Tell her how you feel,That girl need some self esteem that's all,!<br>  How old are you and you're friend anyways?|`|bS7DN85Qaa	What?|`|AA12088442	tell her that shes annoying and hang up.|`|p7izYNBpaa	SHE ISNT YOUR FRIEND,.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Umm... and why is she your "best friend"...?|`|uV2ql06Oaa	eew DEF ignore the call.. she sounds like a TERRIBLE friend.. worse than someone I know...|`|x3g9IlhVaa	She is a liar and a jealous one at that.<br>  If she picks on you for your weight and friends she is jealous.  If she compares you to her other friends tell her to spend time with them instead.  If she picks on your friends she is jealous of your friendship with them.<br>  <br>  When she mimics do something back to her she hates and then ask her how she likes it.<br>  <br>  So what if you cant fight..like you need to know because....<br>  <br>  I had a friend once like this...I dont talk to her anymore because she got really mad one day and told me I couldnt have any other friends if I wanted to have her stay around..I picked my other friends.|`|wZnGkHHMaa	me and my friend were going through the same things but soon i found out that she was going through some things and she was taking her anger out on me after talking to her i found out what her deal was and eventually the way that she was acting was a faze . maybe you should talk to your friend and you will probably find out some things that you never knew. but remember to always be patience and to never gi ve up on her because what she really needs right now is a TRUE friend.|`|3HWV0AkKaa	I totally agree wit brooke/^|`|EGiIcGOiaa	ignore her|`|2FSaPkupaa	dont be friend with her and put poop in her pillow|`|ALWsz6XLaa	The best thing to do..Is the hardest thing to do!<br>  when your friend calls you on Friday, answer! But you'll have to say all of this to her either on the phone or tell her that the two of you really need to talk about things.  Make your points out clearly in your head before hand cause it'll be so nerve raking!  Do something about it now, the longer you put it off the worse things will get for you, you'll became more upset about things.  Don't put it off, deal with it asap, especially if you don't want to loose your bff!! Good Luck!! Really hope it works out for ya!|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Just explain to her what you just told us. Tell her you love her and you aren't trying to put her down or make her feel bad, but it upsets you when she does those things and you don't want to keep feeling angry at her because she is your best friend.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do in any relationship, whether that be friends or dating or family or whatever, is to be open and honest about how you are feeling. Covering it up or ignoring it is only going to make you bottle things up until you start resenting that person. And that makes things much worse.<br>  <br>  So just tell her, and if she's really your best friend, she'll try to make things better. Just remember it goes both ways too, so if you do things that make her upset don't get mad when she brings it up.
1IDSGM71aa	Yes orgasms can bring on labor because when you have an orgasm it causes your uterus to contract, which can lead to labor contractions. Hang in there mama! How far along are you? If you're full term, then I don't see any reason why you shouldn't go for it. But, if you aren't full term yet, I would advise waiting a little while. (But, say, if you're 36 weeks, talk to your doctor about it as you said you were going to and see what he thinks. If your baby is large enough and seems healthy enough, he may give you the ok to try to induce yourself.) Walk a lot, too. That can help. REALLY bumpy car rides, sex (as you mentioned, sperm contains oxytocin, I think, the natural form of pitocin which is what they would give you in an iv to induce in the hospital), and there are several herbs and teas, I believe. Just please don't take castor oil. I never tried it because I didn't fancy the idea of having diarrhea and vomiting and stomach pain (on top of labor, if it worked). Best wishes!|`|AA11599282	Sex, or should I say, semen, can cause you to go into labor.  Good luck.  I'm so excited for you!|`|kprKXEOSaa	Orgasm can help start uterine contractions.  It's worth a try, right?    Sounds like you need to get to the hospital sooner rather than later.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	orgasms can help because it contracts your uterus some- sperm also helps to soften the cervix, nipple stimulation, walking, squats|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Warm baths work also or keeping active|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Orgasms can cause some contractions, but usually it isn't going to start labor.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	yes, the orgasms can induce contractions, and contractions can start labor. Its the SAME concept as nipple stimulation. Its just not as easy.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	orgasm does help bc it stimulates the uterus muscles and most of the time it makes the waters break when it's ready to.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Orgasms won't help but nipple stimulation does so if you have a breast pump I would pump for at least an hour every few hours and see if that helps|`|VdaQ2Vo0aa	Not that I know of.  The sperm does soften the cervix.    When your body is ready and the baby is ready you will go into labor.  Let nature take it course plus enjoy the time you have because when the baby is here your life will change.    Good luck and I wish you a short labor.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	In my opinion they do!!  The day I went into labor..I had two of the most amazing orgasms and I was in labor about 5 hours later.    Prior to that day I hadn't had sex in like two weeks..so I would say the sex did it.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Yes, the facts that you said the sperm can bring it on is real. The hormone that your body release during an orgasm, is the same hormone your body release during labor.
jqUkAvlbaa	the weight an average 4 yr old varies between 12-26 kilo's the one you want to be aiming for is around 16 ,but i wouldn't see 19 as a problem<br>  <br>  the height average  for a 4yr old is 96-109 cm the ideal height being 102 so your boy just seems to be taller than other kids.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't worry at all<br>  <br>  :D|`|ofz43OY4aa	if your not happy with your child's weight, eating patterns, diet, then see a doctor, if you think all these things are o.k then stop worrying! easier said than done, but something you have to learn to do as a parent
LWXRVO5Haa	Toys with loud sounds are not good for babies and small children, because it can damage their hearing. Look for toys that have softer sounds or volume control buttons.|`|nYioXmnGaa	My seven month old if he hears something that is to loud he just starts crying. So it is kind of  easy for me to tell .|`|gFiRi5xnaa	If you can hear it in the other room, it's too loud. Get duck tape and put it over the sound. It will drown it out a little but still completely audible|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Often toy makers make toys loud enough so those who may purchase them can hear them in a noisy store, but then when you get home it's way too loud, which stinks since we are all born with excellent hearing but with abuse we start to loose the amazing range and sensitivity to sound.<br>  <br>  We do several things, if we can we open the toy up and place a piece cardboard in front of the speaker or duct tape works very well too placed over the speaker for reducing noise.   Plus that helps us stay sane as well.
SEzIkGNiaa	Where I live, you have to be 16 legally to get a "real" job.  I was around the age of 8 when made money by helping my grandpa out at his factory, and having bakesales and lemonade stands.  If you are 13, you can:    Babysit  Dog walking/Sitting  Bus Boy  BakeSales/Lemonade Stands  Paper Route  Clean Houses  Lawn Care (raking leaves, weeding, mowing lawns ect..)|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	Well it depends on where you live. Here you have to be a least 15 and have a work permit from school signed by your parents.|`|m53cNF4iaa	13|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Strange to ask that in the parenting section, but anyway.. Lol.  It depends on what country you're in, and what state you're in. In Australia the standard youngest age is 14 and a half.|`|njbmqjCTaa	Where I live it's 15.|`|prqrQcd1aa	In my state you can work some where at 14 years old, with working papers.. to look up more information looked up the department of labor and industry in your state.  It will have child labor laws there and you will be able to look them up, example: i live in PA, it's called Pennsylvania department of labor and industry here.|`|HYrs7qzBaa	IT DEPENDS ON THE STATE ...

S6ResSu3aa	There are a few tests out there that claim to give you an accurate result up to 6 days before. But they're not 100%. On one particular product(sorry, cant remember which one) it's only about 50% accurate 6 days before. That goes up the closer you get to your period date.<br>  They're not cheap though.<br>  Save the pennies and wait a few days, you will need all the money you can get when you do have a baby! :-)|`|eNcRDlvFaa	Use it first thing in the morning (hormones are more concentrated then) and don't be too disappointed if it is negative - wait a couple of days and try again.<br>  <br>  Remember though - even a very faint positive is still a positive.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|t5NjDHoTaa	Some tests, like First Response might be able to pick it up.  The tests that cost a little bit of money might be able to tell you, but even then it might still be better to wait until next week  :-)|`|09c62ba518541c8e419aa8c6b2bef14faa	hi, you can now buy a pregnancy testing kit specially designed to work 7 days before your period is due, good luck hope you find out soon xx|`|qIGLGspIaa	hi i have used a 1st response hpt, they have a couple in their range but they have 1 now where it can be used 6 days before your period,good luck!|`|tObN47vQaa	I would do a sensative one.  It can show up with morning urine!  If it doesnt then take another to make sure.  Good Luck to you|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'd wait a few days, some tests do work up to 6 days before a missed period, but they're not as reliable if used that early.  I wouldn't completely trust a negative result 5 days before your period is due, but a positive wouldn't be wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|io0QtYYtaa	actually five days is ok, but the chances of it being accurate are lower. about 51% lower. good luck
4k59EjXUaa	Well You Might As Well Be! All Those Signs ARE An Early Sign Of Pregnancy|`|W4gbI6hzaa	Yours breasts may be sore because your wearing a bra that is to small.  x
3OVn4Ceoaa	You just pull him/her into their office and start talking. I can remember when I told my boss. He was on his way out the door and I asked can I walk him to his car. Of course he told me yes. We got outside, I took a deep breath and I began. I asked him did he remember when I went to the doctor, cause I had went a week before, he told me yes and I just broke it to him. I told him, "Well, they told me I was pregnant." He was silent for a while. Then he told me that everything was okay and that nothing was going to change at least not by him. He was totally understandable in every way possible. He let me know that we can discuss my maternity leave and so forth at another time but at that moment he handled it pretty well. So it's no big deal just let him know that you're expecting and the most he can do is accept it. He can't fire you or tell you not to come to work anymore. That's against the law. Now the maternity leave and pay thing I'm not sure what to tell you. You have to do what's right for you...so Good Luck and Congrats on your baby.|`|7FMccjwtaa	Just go up to him and tell him! I'm sure he'll understand! BTW Congrats! |`|AA11497295	Just say "guess what I have just found out I'm  pregnant, it's OK it is not yours. Now how am I fixed for maternity leave?"|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	There's no need to tell them right away. In the US many women often wait to disclose the pregnancy to others (especially non-family) until they are past the first trimester. Since early miscarriages can be common early on, many women don't want to tell everyone they are pregnant only to have to break the news later on that they lost the baby.     So unless there is a need that your boss would have to know right away, I would consider waiting a little while.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Depending on your job duties, you may want to wait a month or so before telling your boss. If you are showing a little and at around 12 weeks, then tell him in the next week or so. Other than that wait.    The way I told my coworkers was I purchased a shirt that said "yes, I'm pregnant." I am not the type of person to come foward and tell people that I'm pregnant so I wanted something different. Everyone loved the shirt.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	what do you mean break it to your boss.  The only profession where this would be a problem is if you r a stripper.  Just ask your boss about maternity|`|JwAUeExQaa	Erm, could you give a little more information? Is it very uncommon for people to be allowed maternity leave in South Africa or something?|`|kVBDpAMTaa	You shouldn't be worried about telling him, he can't fire you for it. Just let him know you are pregnant and then talk about maternity leave/pay.
pzLDXL6gaa	Contact these guys and ask: http://www.morning-after-pill.org/mornin...    Laws vary by country but in most places it's available over the counter to girls of all ages.    Harriet|`|bWl17S3waa	available to all and u can get it at any convenience story i can imagine even 7-11 would have it|`|lJZNGsZCaa	Doctors or family planning clinics can help with this not sure about age but clinic should be able to give you good advice if you cant go to parents.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	if you're in australia you can get it at most pharmacies and there are no age minimums.|`|JexFy4Cnaa	You should be able to get it without a prescription from the chemist (in Australia that is the case) but make a doctors appointment, even at one of those medical places that are for emergencies. Its hard to advise you because i don't know what  country you are in, but the morning after pill is definately not for just 18+ You should have a community center/sexual health clinic / school nurse/doctor with in your reach.   Good luck, don't panic but be persistent, and remember the more time that passes the more chance of pregnancy (something i only learned a short time ago). Be persistent until you get an appointment to see someone because the consequences could be pretty major if you don't.  Best of luck to you.|`|uf4SNnSWaa	Ask your mom and dad.  They should help you with this.|`|C2HuAxZdaa	the health department will supply you with a free morning after pill, such as plan b. they are available there to any girl who comes in needing one, no matter the age. they will not tell your parents, its confidential. good luck!|`|rR5nIklWaa	a local  clinic  like a planned paret hood and there you can get  the pill for free and u can get  put on birth control too for free google  it  and they wont tell any one ur info
HnDwsN9raa	Here is what I got from whenmybaby.com<br>  <br>    <br>   <br>  My period is late, but my home pregnancy test is negative- when should I test again?  <br>    <br>   <br>  There are many reasons for a late period that may not indicate pregnancy. You may just be having a longer cycle, a later ovulation, an anovulatory cycle (for some reason you didn't ovulate this cycle), you may have a hormone imbalance, thyroid or pituitary dysfunction, or stress may be causing the hypothalamus to prevent you from ovulating this month. <br>  You also may be early pregnant and you may be getting a false negative because you ovulated later in the cycle than you anticipated. <br>  <br>  You should retest in one week, and if the pregnancy test is still negative, and you are usually not irregular, you should contact your physician for further guidance and advice. <br>   <br>   Last Period Start Date<br>  Mon Jan 5, 2009   Approx. Ovulation Date<br>  Sat Jan 31, 2009   Approx. Next Period<br>  Sat Feb 14, 2009  <br>  Your period is 6 days late  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Home Pregnancy Tests (HPTs)  <br>  You are 6 days late. All HPTs will detect pregnancy now, including those listed below. <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  And that is if your cycle is 40 days long.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ya.|`|kulDK5jsaa	no|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Well, if your cycle has been known to go for up to 40 days then you're not really "late" yet.  I'd let it go 45 days before testing.
0jkuZYkkaa	Yes definitely. In fact, I recommend it. I'm not bad-mouthing doctors or anything, but you won't get as much attention if your symptoms aren't obvious, visual, or bad. It's like in the majority of professions. Is a teacher going to go out of his or her way to help a child if he doesn't complain about it? No. So yeah, when you go to a doctor you've gotta make sure never to underplay whats wrong with you. Your insurance company is paying them, so make them work for the money. Ask about what they could do and tell them what's wrong, maybe with a little exaggeration. Basically yes, I do agree and sometimes feel like exaggeration is needed. Especially in the emergency room.|`|Es2QJ44Uaa	A good doctor will  listen.  Be careful about exaggerating, dr. don't like hypocondriacs (or people they suspect could be).  Be honest and say you want the testing done and you don't want to exaggerate to get the care you need. <br>  Sometimes they are right of course.  But regardless, nobody knows your body like you do.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Yes! Every time!|`|zmpk29BLaa	Sometimes i have to suck my doctor off so he'll give me free pillz|`|wYF6U6qlaa	I have Kaiser insurance. I feel I practically have to be on death's door to warrant them spending a dime on me. Do what you need to do to get care.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	no i have been ok so far and trust my dr , i hope you are ok|`|RjoCYCkQaa	This is just you being over dramatic. This pregnancy is probably the only thing that has ever happened to you with any significance. so naturally you are going to over exaggerate everything. This has finally give you the identity you have been craving all these years. embrace it and make everyone around you know just how pregnant you really are!|`|6PNuFgTJaa	YES! The only problem is that you have to watch what you say. I mean too much and they'll want to keep you for observation.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Yeah.. and I get the feeling that they are used to people exaggerating all the time that they just tell people to "rest."|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	yes<br>  i am not pregnant but i know exactly what you are talking about|`|9cu82009aa	Yeah, I know what you mean... I've had SPD with the last 2 pregnancies and this time it was really bad, yet my doctor didn't take me seriously until I told him just how serious it was. <br>  <br>  Don't even reply to Mr Awesome unless he's asking a question, then it's an easy 2 points... he's a dweeb to say the least, he has no life outside YA! and tries to get a rile out of everyone.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lol No. I do the opposite. I play it down. I don't like all the fuss.<br>  <br>  But I am high risk so I get enough fuss. Don't care for it.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	every time, especially because im a teen mom|`|0RCGy3OOaa	doctors are overloaded with people that have nothing wrong with them.. so yes, you will have to exaggerate every time.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Yeah pretty sad tho isnt it.|`|DiPc84wQaa	yeahh all the time or they just tell you to 'rest' or something.<br>  <br>  xD|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Yes, haha. I hate doctors!|`|In6t9yiRaa	omg yes!!
prqrQcd1aa	honestly it is very well possible for him to have a child that looks like this, especially with the irish and Caribbean decent!  My youngest two siblings have blonde hair and blue eyes and their father had dark brown eyes, and black hair... just because people say that a certain gene is predominant, doesn't mean it always is! The best thing for him to do to be 100 % shure is to just get a DNA test done honestly.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Hair color, skin color, eyes, noses etc. is not a indicator of parenting. A DNA test will tell them for sure. He should take one. If he does not handle this in a responsible way, you should take that as a sign of his character or lack of.|`|yuJHyr5Haa	ask her for a dna test if you think this is possible|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	If she says that he's the father then he should have this tested. If she claims he isn't the father he should back off and leave the mother to get on with it.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Yes, the baby very well could be his.  Didn't you read about the couple white woman and black man who had twins - one white baby and one black baby?  Anything is possible.  If he's so uncertain, he needs to get a DNA test done.  It's not fair to leave the little girl hanging when "Daddy" is denying her.  He needs to settle the matter once and for all.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	DNA test... Looks don't mean a thing!|`|uf4SNnSWaa	what was he doing with a white girl?|`|1audzkx6aa	Get them tested and see whose baby it is|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Absolutely possible.    Tell him to insist on a dna test, before she decides to take him to court for child support.     If he is or isn't, it'll be better to know.|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	The only real way to know is to have a DNA test done. Since your boyfriend has English and Irish heritage, it's possible that his children could be born with light skin and blue eyes (Blue eyes being a trait common to the Irish heritage, not to mention the pale skin - those genes are recessive and can show up on down the line in the family).     You can never tell 100% by just looking at the child, as babies eyes are never really their permanent color until around 4-5 years of age. My eyes were blue until I was 4, then slowly turned to the dark brown they are now.     So to be 100% sure, that way there can never be any doubt, have a DNA test done so that your boyfriend can do the right thing.

hNr3GFvlaa	Obviously this is a very important matter for your child. <br>  <br>  He will grow out of that. It is important how you relate to him when he feels the big feelings around separation. <br>  <br>  You don't have to always comply to his requests, and at the same time, it will be helpful if you tell and show him that you understand how sad and difficult it is for him when you have to leave.|`|FVeNsugBaa	He's three years old! Yes, he'll grow out of that. Most kids are attached to their parents and hate being away from them at that age. When he gets a little older he'll understand that he can't be with you always, and he'll have an easier time without you the older he gets.|`|wWaGn3WLaa	i think that your child has a secure attatchment; they get upset when you leave but when you return the child is ok.<br>  i am pretty sure that he will.|`|5NiF431Gaa	He will probably grow out of it but if he doesn't, he might have separation anxiety.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	He'll grow out of it, but you need to help him. Take a step back. If he stood by the door at daycare the whole time you were gone, that's okay. I bet you within a week he'd be playing with the other kids there. If you constantly come to his rescue every time he cries for you at daycare or anywhere else, he will learn that he *doesn't* have to play with anyone else and that he *doesn't* have to let anyone else care for him. You're showing him that it's okay for him to be this attached because you'll do anything it takes to keep him from being sad.<br>  <br>  It's okay to let your kids be sad sometimes. Of course you need to care and love for him, but it's okay to let him be sad at daycare for a couple of his days. It's okay to let him be sad because he has to play with kids other than his siblings. He'll get over that sadness eventually - but you have to *let* him get over it.|`|0RCGy3OOaa	just spank him once or twice
9P26sacKaa	There are a LOT more cons to c-section than recovery period and a scar.  After all, moms are four times as likely to die from a c-section than from a vaginal birth.  Babies are more likely to have breathing problems, need to spend time in the NICU, and have a lot of other health issues.  Moms have lifelong risks to their reproductive health, including additional risks of life-threatening placental abnormalities in all future pregnancies.  Vaginal births after cesarean (VBAC) is getting harder and harder to get, even though it's safer than a repeat c-section.  Time Magazine just published an article about this: <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1880665-1,00.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a>  After a c-section, your future babies are more likely to miscarry or be stillborn because of issues with your uterus or placenta.  Your baby doesn't get all of the added benefits of labor, which have been proven to actually exist.  Women are more likely to suffer from postpartum depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder after a c-section.  It's very scary to get major abdominal surgery in order to have a baby.  <br>  <br>  The cons of a vaginal birth?  It will take longer.  It could happen at any time of the day or night, which isn't really a con in my opinion.  The labor could be less comfortable, but this is far outweighed by the emotional and spiritual benefits as well as the recovery and bonding you get with your child.  Labor gives you all sorts of hormones that make you connect more easily with your child, helps your child adjust to the outside world, and gives you a lot of other benefits as well.  Some people say it will "ruin your vagina," but that's been actually proven to be untrue.  Your vagina is designed to stretch and go back to place.  Can you imagine if a penis were ruined because of it stretching during an erection?  Hah!  Vaginas are also designed to stretch and go back without damage.<br>  <br>  If you're really looking for lots of information on c-sections, visit the ICAN web site: <a href="http://www.ican-online.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ican-online.org</a><br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision!|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Cons.... it goes longer (usually) and there's still the risk of needing an emergency c-section.<br>  <br>  That said, I would NEVER choose to have a c-section unless it was absolutely necessary. The recovery is hell, and there's a risk of the epidural paralyzing you. It's major surgery.|`|6wkcp8Xcaa	You shouldn't be considering either if you're worried about any of those things happening. The most important thing is to hope and pray you have a good, healthy baby and delivery. You can buy creams to help deminish scar blemishes and keep doing your pelvic floor exercises to help keep the ole foo foo tight lol... i'm not going to go into too much detail or you might not want to have kids lol...|`|AXEqOEloaa	There are no cons for natural child birth unless the baby is in danger. We are made to go through natural birth not to be sliced open with a knife just cause.|`|5EQdzWuUaa	either way you get something bad, either a loose pussy or a nasty scar|`|ib2BLbDTaa	Well although we are made for natural birth it doesn't mean your body isn't going to take a beating.

BTuFtui3aa	It depends. <br>  <br>  If you were put on the pill to start your periods and now have them without the pill, your amenorrhea shouldn't be an issue if you have a healthy menstrual cycle now. That would mean your hormones were out of whack, but are back to normal now.<br>  <br>  If you continue to have to take the pill, conceiving may be difficult for you, since you're dependent on a contraceptive for your hormonal regulation. You might still be able to get pregnant, but you would likely need fertility treatments.<br>  <br>  Whether you can conceive, either naturally or with fertility treatments, depends more on your CURRENT hormonal situation than what was going on in the past. You should ask a doctor this, as they can check your hormone levels for you and suggest the best strategies for conception when you decide to try for children.|`|Rj0hV0E8aa	you should talk to plannedparenthood or a gyno. it could be successful but also have prob.

Xrwvu5Uraa	I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was about 2 and a half months, close to 3 months pregnant, unfortunatly. So, I didn't feel anything during those times. Every woman is different though, keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Right now I am 6 months and it just feels big haha, and feeling her kick and move around is amazing! It truly feels like a life moving around inside of you, if you can imagine.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i'm in my fourth month and my stomach is "hard" but not completely.<br>  and i'm starting to show a noticeable bump.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	It really depends on the person. I didn't start to show until about 4 months and my tummy was slightly hard my whole pregnancy. I am litteraly all baby no extra fat. LOL  I started to get butterfly feelings at about 5 months and by 6 months I could feel her move around. They are like tapping like pushing your tounge to the side of you cheek. Only creating a differnt emotion ( if you know what i mean). At 8 months we could track her feet and hands and see them move along my tummy.  But it is hard to explain how you will feel everyone is different.|`|QT5ROElraa	well, i didn't start showing at all until week 22, and finally someone said "hey ur just barely beginning to show!" <br>  <br>  So, it's not like u'r tummy will feel different over night, except that i had morning sickness and that was horrible.<br>  <br>  the last few months as i could feel the baby moving it was so cool! the whole last month he was so strong i could sometimes grab his little foot when he kicked it out. i knew his foot was at least as big as my whole pointer finger, and actually it was a little bigger when he was finally born. <br>  <br>  Now that I had him, two weeks ago today! my tummy feels like there is a balloon in it that is slowly going down a few inches at a time.|`|cn91FeWcaa	6 mos... its still pushable but solid at the same time

I think one of the most nervous parts of pregnancy for me was just feeling like I could some how "screw up." (Most of those feelings came from me listening too much to unwanted/unsolicited advice from others.)<br>  <br>  And if you're eating healthy, getting some exercise, and generally taking care of yourself, I think you'll be just fine. Sometimes just learning more about pregnancy and what's happening can be helpful.

With a first baby, if you don't have risk factors for premature labor, you're more likely to go late than early!|`|4ZQxAvE2aa	First of all just relax. Its never good to stress out about the things you can't control. If your baby was born right now, it would have a chance of surviving.

dpPqH7BAaa	Well, you're right on schedule for being pregnant. However it may be too early for some tests to tell. Most times when a pregnancy test isn't accurate, it's because you had a false negative. How the tests work, is by picking up a hormone your body produces when you are pregnant. It won't say positive unless it picks up the hormone. If you got one positive, you are pregnant, even if the others say negative. That test may just be stronger than the others. I'm going to say Congratulations!!! If you aren't convinced, wait 3 more days, and take another test of the same brand. I would wait a week, but I know how eager you get when you want to know, so 3 days should be safe if you got one positive from that brand. CONGRATULATIONS MOMMY!!!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would go with the positive one.  Were they different brands because if so then maybe one brand was more sensitive than the others or maybe you are just early testing and the hcg hormone isn't in a high amount yet.|`|AA11845211	It means you should be using birth control!    From previous postings, it looks like you already have (at least) one child.      Don't you know what causes them?  That would be unprotected sex!|`|C1gxGabgaa	Congratz.... ders nothin such as a false positive....|`|IllWKAUGaa	It means you're pregnant! You had sex right at ovulation....you can't take test right after test because your urine get diluted and the test wont pic up the hormones and it wont be accurate, that's why it's best to test with first morning urine, its more concentrated and most accurate. Test again tomorrow morning and it will be positive...    congrats and good luck.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It means you shouldn't take a test at night! lol Seriously, all pregnancy tests should be taken with your first mornings urine because that is when your hCG levels are at their strongest. If you got 1 positive then you are pregnant, the other negatives are probably because you didn't have enough hCG to be detected in the later urine. Congratulations!
dpPqH7BAaa	If it's steady, it's most likely not a contraction. Those come and go, get more painful then fade. If you coughed pretty hard, you could have slightly pulled a muscle (I've done that) and it causes the muscles and tendons around your uterus to tighten. This can however bring on labor, so if the pain starts to fade, then come back, time them. If you are in labor, they will be constant and not go away when you lay down or drink water.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Just sounds like soreness and not contractions...you would know if you were having contractions because it would ease up and then happen again.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	no, if it was a contraction, then it would come and go, and it's not just on one side of your pelvis honey, when the baby is ready to come, your back will hurt and it will wrap around your belly and hurts so bad you can barely move, it's a very VERY painful cramp and you feel like your about to die.......i'm on my 4th baby right now.....and the pain is always the same........congradulations by the way......when you cough, the strain on your stomach is 10 times worse when your pregnant....so more than likely you pulled a muscle, i have done that a few times.......|`|AA11310490	HI LULU MY FRIEND, LONG TIME. YES WERE GOING TO HAVE ABABY REAL SOON. CALL UR DR. ANDHIT ME BACK. CONGRATS|`|4k59EjXUaa	Well The First Thing You Need To Think About Is.....How Far Apart Are They? The Next Thing i Need To Say Is Contractions Can Often Be Like That So You ARE Probably In EARLY Labor|`|FRFryWDfaa	i think it is probably a muscle pain from your coughing but if it gets worse or doesn't go in a hour or so i would ring the hospital or your midwife just to see what they say good luck and congratulations xxx
Ar6wD9Oeaa	... Well ...    1.) dont shower for a few days and dont wear deoderant (if possible) and make sure you spend every moment near her. Maybe then she'll see what your talking about.    2.) does she wear deorderant ? cheapy deorderant doens't really work well for those with bad body odor. I use secrete or Dove. they have the highest aluminum levels for anti-persperrant.    3.) take her walmart and let her pick out her own body wash and a pouf so that It's JUST HERS . every woman loves a fancy body wash that smells nice. Or maybe bath and body works.    4.) buy her a book about it. Like a puberty book that explains what the changes are. There used to be a book called the facts of life. It told you everything. I really liked that book when i was teenager. I think it would be informative for your daughter as well. My mom got it a barnes and nobles about 13 years ago.      If none of that works, embarass her. Have her friends tell her. or a friend of yours or someone at church. Sometimes a little humiliation will do the trick, and you wont look like the bad guy or nag, and then you can console her and tell her that you've been trying to help her all along.    Good luck|`|4JgSq2rlaa	maybe she likes the smell or her boyfriend likes fishy girls|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	I agree with someone above who mentioned taking her to walmart and letting her pick out her own Body Wash and whatever else she wants to let her shower with. Don't nag her about it, just let her pick out her own scent. If you want to splurge a little, take her to bath and body works or even Victoria's Secret.     If nothing else, just let her smell. Eventually, other people will tell her that she smells or they'll make fun of her. I know it'll be hard to think about your daughter being teased or talked about or made fun of - but in the end it might work. If she ever comes home saying she doesn't have any friends, tell her that maybe if she would shower regularly people wouldn't be afraid to hang out with her.|`|FAv1RYe6aa	Don't wash her clothes. Give her her meals on dirty dishes. Tell her that if she doesn't clean herself then she wouldn't mind wearing dirty clothes or eating off of dirty dishes.|`|v5nRQZtpaa	tell the guy she likes to comment on it :P lol, so mean|`|99ML0m2yaa	Tell her that she will never get a boyfriend get married have sex have babies or get a good job because everyone will hate her or make fun of her.  or you could tell her that if she isn't clean there is a chance she could get crabs...scare her.  Lol|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	Embarass the crap out of her. This is a very big issue. Have one of your close friends that she doesn't know point it out in a big way. If that doesn't work, go stinky yourself. Who wants to smell their mom's B.O after all?|`|kprKXEOSaa	That's weird, most girls, if you told them they smelled, would immediately take a shower, and put on tons of deodorant and perfume.  Most girls don't want to smell bad.  That is very strange.   However, I guess it will help keep her out of trouble, as the boys won't be very attracted to her, so it's not all bad....|`|prqrQcd1aa	how old is she? I would personally just tell her she isn't getting dinner until she's taken a shower and cleaned herself up!|`|kk8ypSTSaa	b like someone smell mmuussssttttyyyyyy hehe|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Most people do not smell their own odor, but find other people odor to be offensive. It's like visiting the local cow farmer, you kinda wonder to yourself,how can they stand this smell all the time? But living there the smell doesn't bother them because they are there all the time. Tell her she will be responsible to do her own laundry and maybe when she gets a whiff of her clothes she will start washing more. but ultimately her hygiene will change when someone her age tells her she stinks or maybe a teacher at school can leave a note on her desk that reads, Dude your ripe and need to wash more i can't study you smell so bad.|`|AA12145826	Chances are she's just as embarrassed about it as you are so try a different approach. Instead of just calling her on it ("You stink!") try a empathizing with her ("Honey, I know you think I'm nagging, but really I remember how embarrassing things like odor can be at your age. I'm not accusing you of not washing properly because I know you practice good hygiene, but maybe we need to try something different.")    Next, you could try and take her with you to the store and let her pick out her favorite antibacterial body wash, loofah or one of those shower poofs, and a good, strong antiperspirant/deodorant (Mitchem's is good as are any of the "prescription strength" brands). In addition make sure to wash her clothes in a strong odor removing detergent. If after a few weeks, you don't notice any improvements, you may want to take her to a doctor. Its very rare, but there are disorders out there that cause children to produce a stronger than normal body odor and require the use of medication to control.|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	keep nagging, she'll do it. also try and embarrass her in from of all here friends if she has any. she will be mad but she will want to prove you wrong.|`|trrHx86Waa	pour mud on her, maybe she will take a shower?|`|6bfc448c8de0de5ed551f6041055f3c9aa	When she gets rejected enough by the opposite sex, or whichever gender it is she is attracted to, she will shape up.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	How old is she?    If she's in her teens, I think the best thing you can do is say "look honey, I love you, but you stink". If that doesn't help, take her to a doctor and tell them your daughter has a really bad odor to her, and you think it might be medical, and then when it's not, and the doctor tells your daughter to go take a shower, she'll see the light.|`|7IaKIxBVaa	maybe you should tell her that boys  wouldn't like that and MAYBEEE she'll listen?
kprKXEOSaa	When your water breaks, they want the baby to be born within 24 hours, because the baby is at increased risk of infection.  She is full-term, so this is very normal.  As long as the amniotic fluid was clear and colorless and didn't have any odor, she is ok to stay home for a bit and walk around and eat a good breakfast, if she's not having contractions.  She should not insert anything into the vagina, no tampons or anything.  She can use a pad to absorb further leaks.  However, the water breaking can make the labor go really fast, so if contractions have started, get her to the hospital.  And, don't wait too long, even if she's not contracting.  Once the water breaks, the baby needs to be born fairly soon.    And if the amniotic fluid was murky or had pieces of stuff in it, or was green or brown or smelled at all, or if she's bleeding at all, you need to get her to the hospital right away.  And also if anything comes out of her vagina, for example the umbilical cord or the baby's foot--have her lie down with her pelvis elevated and call an ambulance.    There is no reason at this point she would need to have a c-section.  If her contractions and labor don't progress, they will induce her with pitocin before doing a c-section.  If you're at the hospital with her, why not ask the doctor to explain what is going on?    The only reasons they would do a c-section would be if the baby went into distress, or if she started bleeding or something like that.  Or, if they determine that the baby's head is too big to get through her pelvis, but this is very rare.  Usually the c-section is reserved for an emergency.  Just having your water break doesn't constitute an emergency.  My water broke with my first child, at 37 weeks, and my contractions and labor didn't progress as quickly as they wanted, so they induced me with pitocin and my baby was born with no complications.  Looking back now, I felt they rushed the whole thing needlessly, I mean the baby wasn't in distress, and I could have walked around a while longer to get the contractions and dilation to progress, but it was my first and I didn't know any different and just did what they told me.  I think sometimes they rush things just to keep on schedule, but the c-section is generally reserved for a true emergency.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I had EXACTLY the same experience and had a completely normal childbirth, no c-section! Once my water broke things moved very quickly. I went from 0 dilation to birth within 5 hours.|`|627pWyVkaa	Just means her body isn't ready to start labour yet. However most doctors will make you go in if you dont deliver or get dilated within 2 days, because of concern for infection and everything else. :)|`|4k59EjXUaa	Well First Of All Tell Your Friend Congrats! Second Of All Mother Nature Has To Take Its Course They Might Put Her Some Potossin To Progress the Labor If That Doesn't Work Then They May Have To Go In And Do An Emergency Ceserean If Not Then Pushing Time! Also when The Cervix Is High It Could Be The Beginning Of Dialation So Just Wait And It WILL Happen|`|A1S5KNUkaa	When I went into labour with my son (who's now 8) my waters broke at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon, went to the hospital and they kept me in.  My contractions started at 10pm that night.  They finally chose to induce me (I wasn't dilating enough) at 12pm on the MONDAY which means that my waters had broken 44 hours previously and I'd had constant contractions (no more than 8 mins apart) for 38 hours.  I finally delivered at 4.10pm on the Monday afternoon after 48hrs and 10 mins from waters breaking.  At no point did they suggest a c-section.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	ok for one she can get up and walk around with an IV in her, lol i know because i did it more then once. for two they will either induce her eventually or take her in for a  csection only time will tell|`|dpPqH7BAaa	If her cervix is high, the baby is probably high too and just needs to descend. The best thing is to start walking around to move the baby down and into position. Dilation starts when the baby's head is engaged in the pelvis and pushing the cervix open.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	if she doesn't start to dialate, then more then likely they will have to do a ce-section on her to get the baby out.......it happend to my sister that way.......her and the baby will be fine.....no worries......and good luck to her.....|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	She may need some medication to help her dilate especially if this is her first.  Also she may not dilate because the baby is too large to fit into her pelvis to put the necessary pressure to dilate.  Maybe end up with a c-section.
MBiAm9zaaa	Fortunately, you are not and cannot become pregnant if you have sex right before your period. This is because the egg leaves your body during your period, and another one won't be there again for a few weeks, by which time and sperm inside of you (if there ever was any) will be dead.
Bw1h5xAcaa	See a dentist. You need to have these fixed because they could become infected, and that could be a danger to your baby.    And heavier pain relievers with narcotics can be prescribed safely, as long as your dentist knows you are pregnant.|`|ebedaa7eac23648125f99feeb0ba4235aa	For now use ANBESOL until you can get an appointment with your dentist. You need to gat those fixed ASAP. If your teeth get infected they can pose grave danger for your unborn baby. If the money is an issue for getting them fixed there are plenty of organizations that will be willing to do it for free, you just have to research. Alot of universities that specilize in dentistry will do it for very little or no money as it is practice for the dental students. I got my braces done a while back at a dental university in NY for almost free. Try the anbesol it should work a little but it will not take the pain away. you need to get your teeth fixed.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The only thing I can say is go to the dentist
Po2UqfvWaa	that's normal unless it becomes heavy. i also had light bleeding early on. worry only if it gets heavy|`|ROJans2Taa	it can lead to miscarriage, however spotting is actually pretty common, I spotted/bled from 5 weeks to 11 weeks, with cramps, now my son is 5 mths, I also had a miscarriage that I spotted then found out I had a blighted ovum (sac growing, no fetus). make your doc aware of it so at least they can send you for an ultrasound, there would be nothing they could do to save the pregnancy if it was a miscarriage, but at least you' get peace of mind.

Definitely consult your doctor.|`|8jsoK3zdaa	that happened to me at the exact same time. i went to my doctor and he just said if the bleeding stopped just rest. if it happens again go to the hospital. im due in 5 days!!  its COMPLETELY normal. just look it up on google. you'll be fine. As long as its still not happening. in that case, its the same thing that happened to me. and its scary i was crying and everything. i didnt know it was normal.|`|Dz1AvLjwaa	If the spotting is dark Chocolate coloured visible only while wiping and not accompanied by cramps or clots you and the baby are absolutely fine.Just be a lil extra cautious of what kind of discharge you are experiencing. Brown spotting is normal in first trimester, my mom had it when she was expecting me and also my sister.Just take rest, lift your legs slightly while resting  by putting a pillow below it...it will help.But in case of any pain or cramps, red blood or blue white discharge see your doctor immediately.  All the best to u and ur baby.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Was it bright red (bad),,,brownish (just old blood)|`|kEKcJ5zcaa	It would be best for you to ask a doctor, because you really dont want to be mislead online.|`|f419e3dc2e945b00ef2731e38014e133aa	hmm... i think u should consult ur doctor. im not sure, but this might be a real bad sign.    or it could be totally normal.|`|OFToxXGZaa	You really need to consult a doctor. Everyone will tell you different things - some will say you are fine and others will say not. When I had my first miscarriage I was 5.5 weeks. I woke up in the morning with light spotting - red not brown. It didn't really get heavier until the next day but by then I had already seen my doctor and had scans and blood tests and knew I had/was miscarrying.    This doesn't mean that you are. Some people get their period throughout their whole pregnancy. Just be careful and see you doctor as soon as you can.  Good luck|`|c59cf7cc029c6a1b7b26e42a74c186caaa	Consult a gynaecologist immediately|`|vUOJ6QWBaa	you want to consult your doctor as soon as possible they say a little bit is ok if its dark but just to be safe you should make sure they DO an ultrasound.

If it's still elevated after a day, call her Dr.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	37C is the same as 98.6, which is normal body temperature. If you're concerned, you can give her some Tylenol to take the edge off, but if she seems happy and sleeping or eating otherwise, I wouldn't bother. It's common with vaccinations to run a fever afterwards. I often would give Tylenol beforehand just in case and to ease their comfort. My daughter also ran a fever after her six months shots but was fine the next day.|`|OYjZM4Pjaa	You really only need to take her to the ER if her temp gets to like 104 or 105 degrees. If she gets to like 102 just put her in a cold bath to try and bring down the temp.

jrCZ6fadaa	Where I gave birth, first time parents are required to take a class before being discharged. they are also sent home with a binder of resources and parenting tips. <br>  <br>  i don't know that it will make any difference in an individual who is inherently abusive or neglectful. common sense should be enough, but we all know better. a lot of people who abuse and neglect do it, not because of ignorance, but from lack of control.<br>  <br>  ETA- I think extended family can play a huge role.

xQn3rR6Naa	Sometimes an embryo fails to keep growing and dies When the actual egg sack doesn't come out this is called a blighted ovum and usually means that the embryo had a problem that was incompatible with life. If your body doesn't actually abort spontaneously by the time you go back on March 2nd, then you will be scheduled for a D and C to remove the remaining products of conception, which can cause infection and heavy prolonged bleeding. It is not all that uncommon and happens during the 6th to 11th week. I am so sorry for your loss.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I'm sorry, thats really sad.  Normally they will be able to find the heartbeat.  And if they don't they'll look around for it and find it.  It sounds like you miscarried.|`|kw80YHMLaa	I'm sorry but it does not sound good, i think you may have miscarried. It happened to my sister and its so similar. i wish u all the best|`|oYVZv7oQaa	i think you have had a miscarriage. my doctor since i was 6 weeks could always find my sons heartbeat im so sorry good luck!!!
5yAsj29Vaa	IT'S DIRECTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE "A" KEY!!!|`|ubo0HWtVaa	terrifying, 13 your in junior high, theres nothing you can do about it now, you have to tell them and either keep it or give for adoption. too late for abortion! you need to go to the doctor and get checked out. now remember they will probably get irate, moms going to cry and not everyones parents will be like in juno!!|`|ZaadvJAXaa	His "WIWI"?  You are way too young to be having sex.  Aside from that, I have to agree with ~35 wks along with baby # 4~.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Oh my gosh. <br>  <br>  Seriously? You couldn't search for this and read the thousands of other questions made by the same little girls like you who are pregnant and don't know what to tell their parents?<br>  <br>  Say "Hey, guess what mom and dad? I'm another statistic!"<br>  <br>  I'm only being so blunt because you're in the real world now honey. Have fun.|`|FRwaGpJaaa	Ohh gosh.... Umm Just tell them straight up, maybe try writing a letter. Good luck dear!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	2 weeks ago you posted a question that you were 14. Now you are 13 and pregnant. hmmmm...|`|GeqMrX9laa	oh dang... well telling them is one of the hardest things, i am 15 and pregnant and well this is how i told them, i was in my room crying because i was pregnant and i didn't know what to do so my eyes were all watery n stuff and then my mom told me to come here so i went and she asked me why i was crying and i just wanted to get over with it and i said mom i took a pregnancy test and i am pregnant. she started freaking out and she went to go tell my dad, they kicked me out. they asked me to come back two days later and now everything is okay.  it will be really hard but if you could open your legs to have sex then you got to be responsible now and take care of that baby and tell your parents because it will take all the stress away.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	You should start off by just explaining yourself. It was easier for me cuz I was 18 and in a strong relationship going to be engaged.(we are now) You need to make should that you are taking prenatals they are very important and you need to set them down and just talk.<br>  This may sound easy or hard but being so young it is important to have all the support you need. Start off by telling them you are pregnant and that you are planning on going through with the pregnancy then explain whether or not you would want to keep it or put it up for adoption. <br>  Apologize to them as well this is a BIG deal. Make sure that he is there with you. That way (depending on your parents) it may run smother. Dont't forget his parents but do NOT put all 4 parents together.<br>  Other than that relax (ya right) and tell them. I am 18 and will be 19 in April my baby was due Feb 19 but she is planning on waiting a bit longer to come out LOL. <br>  GL|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Well, start by asking your parents where you and your boyfriend can get jobs at 13 to pay for ... oh wait, child labor laws you can't even afford this kid.<br>  <br>  Planned Parenthood gives confidential abortions. Also consider adoption. Please stay in school.<br>  <br>  And as for your parents, just tell them. Watch Juno or something. Seriously, if you're honest and straightforward and admit you made a mistake, it'll be okay.|`|lJIzFC8iaa	You need to tell them ASAP. You should have gone to the doctor already. This isn't about you and how your parents are going to react. You are still a child adn so its hard to understand but you have this baby growing and completely depending on you for nurishment. Tell them. Take the wrath of parents. And now its time for you to be a parent yourself. Take responsibility. Mom and Dad are the only ones who can help, no matter how disappointed they will be.|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	You might as well just sit them down and tell them. Don't make excuses for. Just explain what has happened. The longer you wait, the harder it is going to be for you to tell them and they're going to find out sooner or later, so it really is better if you tell them now. Then they can help you make the decision that is best for you. Good luck!|`|nYioXmnGaa	ARE YOU DUMB !!!!!!! WHY WOULD YOU SUCK ON HIS THING  HE PEES OUT A THAT !!!!! YOU ARE RETARDED !!!!!!!!!!|`|kw80YHMLaa	Be honest and tell them they can help you|`|sMvWJDqsaa	Well you must be 14...or very, very immature because you are a really bad liar...get a life and go to the "Care Bears" section of Answers...maybe they will believe your games...|`|ECTPfxJNaa	hahaha "wiwi"....but anyway, i am 15 and 5 months pregnant. i started crying and then my mom noticed i was crying and then she asked me what was wrong. i could not stop crying and she started to get annoyed so i finally told her. she said are you sure and i showed her the pregnancy test. she was calm at first. it is really a lot easier if you tell your mother first. my dad was absolutely pissed off though|`|VFIF4zpAaa	Not to be rude or anything but you should have told your parents when you first found out that you were pregnant. They are prob. going to be really angry with you for not telling them to begin with. But maybe they will help you and support them. you should just tell as soon as you think the time is right. really it would have been better if you had told them when you were a month. <br>  Why are you even sexually active at 13 yr. old? <br>  <br>  ~jesus is love~<br>  <br>  p.s. wish you the best of luck tellling your parents|`|NSn0zFfMaa	just sit them down and tell them. you can have a close friend or even the father there when you tell them. make sure that you and them are comfortable and just tell them. at first they will be emotional and upset because it really hasn't sunk into there minds yet but soon they will be better about it!!!|`|Es2QJ44Uaa	What are you doing having sex?  You better tell your parents right away.|`|uPAO6eZdaa	TELL THEM ON MAURRY POVICH OR JERRY SPRINGER THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO WORK OUT FOR EVERYONE!|`|xImOLsHLaa	just tell them....it will be harder the longer you wait|`|WNn8WDPHaa	just be honest with your parents. they can help you with any decision you decide
y9TVkzQYaa	They all sound cute together. There all uncommon names and I just adore uncommon names! lol But anyways...<br>   <br>  Aida Renee is really cute. It kinda reminds me of an older lady, but i really like it! <br>  <br>  Lilah Camille is also cute!! I have actually never heard the name Lilah used before. So I recomend this name. I dont really like the name Camille though. <br>  <br>  Emelia Corinne has a "ring" to it. I like the name Emelia really well, but the name Corinne just aint my style. I dont think it is a good name for a young girl unless its after a grandma or something. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!!!|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Lilah Camille the best. Emelia Corinne is also cute, but I like spelled Amelia.|`|cErLq7f3aa	aida renee i don't like<br>  lilah camille is my favorite by far<br>  emelia corinne ameilia is better|`|afB8s24Maa	third one|`|Sob4zaUSaa	Aida Renee--No offense, but Aida sounds like first aida or Aiden to me.  I don't like it at all, and I am usually really open minded when it comes to names.<br>  <br>  Lilah Camille--It's definitely different, but it has a really pretty ring to it and it's my favorite of the three.<br>  <br>  Emelia Corinne--Eh. It's not really a stand out name, and I think I would like it better if it was Amelia, but honestly, it's just kind of boring.|`|1TgCidVPaa	Lilah Camille<br>  This one is my favorite! I love, love, love the name Lilah. The Camille part is pretty also.<br>  <br>  Aida Renee<br>  I only like half of this one. Aida is pretty but I dont like Renee. Ive never been a fan of the name.<br>  <br>  Emelia Corinne<br>  I only like 1/3 of this one. I like the name Emelia but I would spell it: Amelia and im not too fond of the name Corinne.|`|uSpHh1NPaa	Aida is adorable :)<br>  Renee is quite nice aswell. - i think Renee Aida would flow better though.<br>  <br>  Liliah Camille - all round gorgeous ! love love it !<br>  <br>  Emelia Corinne - i love the spelling of Emelia, i dont like Corinne though.<br>  <br>  Emelia Renee would be great!<br>  <br>  Nice names.|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	I like Lilah but not Camille. I'd love Lilah Corrine!<br>  If not, then Emelia Corrine is fine.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	I really like the spelling of emelia|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I like Lilah but spelled Lila. Camille Lila, instead as well.|`|Dvfb4DZKaa	emelia corinne... i think that's a prettier name...|`|OP7qfOrBaa	i like the name Lilah but thats the only one im afraid sorry.<br>  x|`|BOJEbnCtaa	All three remind me of old ladies.|`|9g734Pjaaa	Aida Renee feels awkward to me.<br>  <br>  Lilah Camille is smooth and sweet and classical and lovely (my very favorite of the three).<br>  <br>  Emilia Corinne is also beautiful.
AA11724307	I always start cramping early like that.  everybody is different and their body reacts in different ways.  as long as everything was ok at the doctors then im sure everything is fine.  I would only be worried if you are in extreme pain or your periods are very irregular.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	yes sometimes small cysts can cause this discomfort, and as long as it's not extremely painful it should be ok, you can also ask fertility specialists online for free and find others going through similar situations, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!

3884ed81dd37e4db9226c11478973595aa	Most likely it is all in your head. You are worried about it so you start to believe anything bothering you could result in pregnancy. Also, stress about whether your pregnant or not can lead to a late period.<br>  BUT...When i was pregnant with my SECOND child...I knew a week after conception due to the fact one evening i woke up craving apple juice and i drank like 4 glasses then threw up. So, I just knew i was prego.<br>  But then again it was my second child so i knew somehting was different.|`|kw80YHMLaa	Funny? its way to early to have any symptoms wait until a few days before your period and take an early test|`|DQlZIzAFaa	no home test can know this early, give it another week or two and either go to a doctor or get a quality home test (the ones that cost less than like $10 are crap)|`|uJFXbHA7aa	I would say that that "funny" feeling is all in your head; however, 15 1/2 years ago my wife and I were trying for a baby.  For many months, nothing.  We decided to give up trying for a while as our financial situation had changed and went back to birth control.<br>  <br>  Then one day, after having a weak (unprotected sex) moment the previous day, she says to me "I know that I am pregnant, I feel it."<br>  <br>  Weeks later, tests confirmed she was pregnant and all timing indicates that hat she was exactly right, so I can't doubt that "feeling funny" might mean that you feel the magic of another life.<br>  <br>  Good luck, either way!!!!|`|wC0HlSA3aa	Describe funny?!?  You can also visit websites like WebMD and they will give you the symptoms of pregnancy :)|`|VHgfWPS2aa	First Response you can  test 5 days before your period|`|XtrkLxylaa	there is a test that u can buy at a store and it is called pregnancy test or just make appointment at a doctor from the hospital
9P26sacKaa	I would usually say that you should head directly to the hospital, but you already said you're not interested in doing that right away.  So I'd suggest contacting your doctor ASAP and tell him/her about the contractions being more painful and how hard it is to move.  They will probably have to go to the hospital, but calling will give you a better idea of what to do.  Your doctor knows your situation better than I do, so that will possibly help you more than just going straight to the hospital if your doctor wouldn't want you to.<br>  <br>  If the medication the hospital has to stop contractions doesn't work on you, there probably isn't anything they can do, but you never know.  It might work better this time even though it didn't before.<br>  <br>  Usually, when your contractions are 4 minutes apart and strong like you describe yours to be, you would be admitted to the hospital for labor anyhow, so you may need to go in anyhow.  They may not be able to stop your labor, but with contractions like these, you may be having your baby tonight anyhow.  Your baby is likely to have signs of prematurity at this point, so waiting too long and having your baby at home might be a very bad thing for your baby.  It would be best to call your doctor and head to the hospital.  <br>  <br>  Just because you weren't dilated much last time doesn't mean you're not in active labor now and almost ready to have that baby.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Even if all they do if give you shots you need to go the hospital because if your baby is coming he/she is going to need medical attention and so are you. For both of you just go and think about you two forget everything else.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	you need to contact your doc or the hospital asap. I was told to contact them anytime i get more than 4 contractions in an hour! Just call - let them know whats going on. They know what's best for you and your little one!|`|kw80YHMLaa	Well im afraid all you can do is go back to the hospital. 34-35 weeks is still very early to deliver i hope you make it to at least 38 weeks|`|KQU5y20waa	if you are close to the hospital, i would wait until they are a little closer, then go to hospital. have you ever heard of a dry birth? that really sucks...... i had mine at 35 weeks, and they never pumped me full of drugs.....|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Well i think its too early to go into labor. I think U should go in right away because..... Labor can go from 4 mins apart to push time in seconds. Been there done that.

63899b8a7193738547e937e28a651057aa	You mentioned you are on a new pill. It could be the reason.  If I were you I would buy those home kit test for pregnancy and check for your peace of mind they are very in expensive.|`|RjoCYCkQaa	just make sure you are not to old. you dont want to have a retard baby. you have to take care of that little window licker for the rest of its life|`|KMtd5gr0aa	No ur ok i think its the pill that makes u feel that way, It did it to me and i got off it, I couldnt handle feeling like i was pregnant if i wasnt.|`|kw80YHMLaa	First of all your doctor is there to help its there job dont worry about bothering them. Personally i think this may be down to the pill it can do some funny things to your body. go to your doc|`|s2X1Wcliaa	Well, if you're getting your period, you can't be pregnant.|`|ojAo1U1caa	Take another test. It will register if your pregnant as long as you have been for at least 10 days or so, no matter where you are on your cycle.<br>  <br>  If not, trust me it's probably your pill. Get it changed to see if it helps with the uneasyness.|`|AajjvZUPaa	Dont worry about bothering your doctor, if you really think you may be pregnant then go to your doctor. Just try not to be paranoid because a lot of times you can misdiagnose a symptom and immediately think it is related to pregnancy. Just wait out the couple of weeks until your period, then call your doctor.|`|IqwR9viwaa	one of the key symptoms is your nipples, have they got white speckles n them? are your milk ducks on the outer ring of your nipple up? squeeze them to see if any milk comes out, but that can also be down to hormone imbalance from the pill, when your pregnant you have butterflys in your lower stomach, i would ask for a blood test as that is the most effective way to find out if you are pregnant or not, hope this was helpful|`|rhypzNW8aa	do a home test,if negative wait a week then do another.If still negative then no worries proberbly just erratic cycle.|`|ycxzeAnMaa	if i was u ill take another test if it comes out negative then you should go to the gyn mabey is something else

LWXRVO5Haa	Don't give up. It will become easier, very soon.<br>  Do you have lanolin? It helps.<br>  The more bottles you give her, the worse her latch will be. If you are giving her formula you will never have enough milk to meet her demand. If you want to be successful breastfeeding, you need to cut that out right away.|`|AA10965418	It is very frustrating. The more you give baby the bottle the more used to it baby will be. Try different holds, the football one worked best for me. Good luck.|`|AA11903503	Try expressing breastmilk before you feed her. You might have a very powerful letdown and that would be why she pulls off and nipple sucks. My son will sometimes chock on my fast letdown, the milk gushes so fast reflex makes him pull off so he will not choke.<br>  Expressing milk before will also help keep your supply up until things get better.<br>  I agree with the others don't give the bottle, but I am not against pacifiers. My son has been using a pacifier since day two and we are very successful at breastfeeding. Sometimes babies just need to suck and mom can't always be there.|`|AA10015577	Why give up?  Just keep trying.  I have a technique that I found on my own that really helped with the pain and getting a correct latch.  Use a 'c' hold around the breast, just around the areola and squeeze slighty to protrude your areola.  Now when you go to put your breast in babies mouth make sure babies mouth is wide enough to latch around the areola.  This is a way so that baby can latch past your nipple, I know how much that hurts.  HTH!  Good luck and don't give up, keep trying!<br>  <br>  BTW, I breastfed for 15 months!|`|FtzaKdCaaa	My baby did the same thing because my milk was coming in too fast for her.  I couldn't get her to stop so she ended up eating that way for a long time.  Eventually my nipples just toughened up and it didn't hurt anymore. As she got bigger, her mouth got bigger and she ended up latching better later.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Do you think it would help to let her suck on something else for say 10-20 minutes before trying again? Maybe get some of the comfort sucking out of her system?
y7hsWAH1aa	Drug her up and drive her to the desert and leave her there and hope she comes home alive without a baby and a nice tan|`|BySnX7Gvaa	First cut weed out of your life she dosent need it around tellher its her decesion what to do with the baby and you will help|`|AhBM5w8maa	Be a more responsible adult actually, why would you let your child do drugs that's sick?<br>  I guess you are just going to have to go along with it because you weren't being a responsible adult.<br>  I blame you just as much as I blame the daughter. <br>  And get her off drugs and too a doctor|`|wxbGmxbOaa	You need to get her some help for her addiction to drugs, they are NOT good for her unborn child. And can cause the baby to have birth defects. You also need to get your daughter to a doctor and have her and the baby checked out to make sure the drugs haven't already had any kind of negative effect on her unborn child. You also need to be supportive of her, she needs her father. And don't do weed around her, because if she has a problem with drugs this is only going to make going off of them even harder for her and it's vital that she gets off them asap! Good Luck and I hope everything turns out ok.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Give her her options,let her pick. Tell her to stop crack(I know lots of friends who have smoked pot while pregnant and all had healthy babies...I don't suggest it)...and be prepared to be there for her, because there's nothing worse then being a teen mom and having your family disown you<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|45e970b2e25dcf51734629fdc5f7a11baa	You and your daughter should stop doing drugs and go to the doctors and figure out a plan.

3uBwwFE0aa	i had two negative results when i was pregnant before i had the positive result. a test can say you're not pregnant when you are but it doesn't say you are pregnant if you're not..(if it says you are then you are, if it says you're not.. you still could be). <br>  <br>  this is what i was told when i asked the doctor why i had two neg results if i actually was pregnant.|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	Yes, negative tests can deffo be wrong & certain things like ovarian cysts or hormone drugs can give you false positives|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	if it shows + nope|`|tUYkerS9aa	The test kits that test the urine should detect hormones associated with pregnancy. Yes they can be faulty but it is more common for false readings to be made when they have not been used correctly and/or the results are misinterpreted. Make sure you follow the instructions very carefully.|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	There is a very small chance they can show an incorrect result. Best thing to do is test twice.|`|JduQHocdaa	False postives yes, false postives are very rare.|`|AA11282101	false positives are extreamly rare false negetives however are more common. whats up with the numbers tho?|`|32i2f6tOaa	While home pregnancy tests have become more and more reliable its important to remember that there is a small margin of error associated with them. Overall home pregnancy tests are 97% accurate. This sounds like a lot, but that means about 3% of the time they can give either a false positive or a false negative. It doesnt sound so bad until it happens to you! Because there is this margin of error it is unlikely but possible that you can get a false positive result even with one of the best tests on the market.<br>  <br>  There are some common causes of false positive pregnancy tests. One of the reasons is a chemical pregnancy, which is an early miscarriage. This is a very early pregnancy that can be detected but is not viable so a woman will have her period and it seems like normal.  Another possible cause of a false positive is waiting too long to read the results. If you way too long to read the test or if you look too early the test is invalid, so be sure to read the directions that come with each pregnancy test to assure you are reading the results at the correct time. There are also some drugs that have hCG in them which can interfere with home pregnancy tests, though this isnt all that common as women on these drugs typically wont attempt a home pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  A very common cause of false positives is evaporation lines. Unfortunately the technology behind the home pregnancy test isnt all that sophisticated so as the urine passes over the indicator screen evaporation occurs and makes a line show up when it shouldnt. Some pregnancy tests are better known for this than others. If you are in doubt about the results wait a couple days and see if you get the same results, if you do, chances are you really are pregnant and it wasnt a false positive.|`|RR35cmBdaa	yes they are they are not 100%<br>  it came up negitive 3 times i then just said to the doc about how i was feeling the took a blood test and let round my tummy and that and im 5 weeks pregnant|`|a398ea473f595655ea49d67d2d328fb1aa	Yes, you can get false positive results. Get yer self to your GP and he can confirm pregnancy with a 99.9% blood test.....|`|FsXTyGH9aa	there is a possibility although it is small..take two..its the only way to know for sure.|`|L4PZfkisaa	yes but usually only when its says negative. <br>  <br>  its difficult for it to say postive if is not true<br>  <br>  x hope thats what u anted to know x|`|SetM2gxRaa	Yep when you hump the wrong way, its all wrong!|`|g3CrnbhAaa	Ofcourse. Like condoms, they only work 97 times out of a 100.|`|2LhpcHE0aa	my pregnancy test showed up negative when i was pregnant! but i didn't need to pee so i drank loads water to make me go...apparently i diluted the hormone in my pee that decides whether your preggas or not! so i took another 1 the next day and i was most deffo up the duff!|`|oQRwwBaWaa	Yes, i bought a pack of 2 cheaper tests from the chemist and they were both negative - i bought the clearblue digital one the following day and when i did it that night it was positive - I am now 18 weeks pregnant.|`|p5wzfp4Faa	they cant be wrong if it shows possitive, but can show negetive if u r pregnant..eg: doing the test to soon|`|JmNaXTjqaa	they can be which is why you should always take a couple
ZdF1hx70aa	You may be pregnant. I would wait for the blood test to come back before you do anything. The most common symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are bleeding and cramping. If you are pregnant or may be pregnant and you experience any or all of the following symptoms, you should immediately seek medical attention for evaluation of a possible ectopic pregnancy. Colicky, crampy pain with tenderness, usually in the lower abdomen that may worsen on straining of bowels, coughing or moving. Sharp, steady pain in the pelvis<br>  Vaginal bleeding Nausea and vomiting Dizziness or weakness (i.e., if the tube ruptures, a weak pulse, clammy skin and fainting are common because of internal bleeding) Shoulder pain Feeling of rectal pressure. <br>  <br>  You should talk more with your doctor.|`|RR35cmBdaa	hi mostly when its positive it means u are pregnant even if u get a negative after that . maybe to early to  show up on a scan yet fingers crossed everything is okk im not to sure and an ectopic pregnancy search the internet might find some stuff but dont read into it to much best of luck|`|IqwR9viwaa	any positive reading means you ARE pregnant, it doesnt matter if they came up negative, you have active pregnancy hormones! Home tests are rubbish, go to the doctor for a test and a blood test, testing the blood is the most effective way of detecting a baby, DO OT TAKE ANY MEDICATION UNTIL YOU ARE 110% SURE!!! There arn't really any symptoms of eptopics, apart from blood specks form inside you, (in your knickers) they only tend to find out when you have your ultrasound. Going by what you have said, You ARE PREGNANT! I would lay money on it! I think your blood test will come back positive, if it doesnt you are not, but i think you are... mama xx|`|EbNnWAZvaa	your doctor shouldn't start you on any pills until they are sure of you not being pregnant. the blood test is usually the last resort if a pregnancy test comes out neg in a doctors office, b/c they need to rule out a ectopic pregnancy or a pregnancy all together.  the ectopic symptoms are pain in the upper left shoulder, severe abdominal pain(where u cant stand it) almost like cramping but 10x worse, lower back pain.
bmoCpcdraa	take away his favorite toy, don't give it back tell he poops in tolit, keep doing it  i hope i helped set him on potty 20 min after he eats for 20 min. every time he poops his pants take a toy away ,be a parent and don't give in to his crying|`|9ufltMBtaa	ok first taking toys away is not smart! he shouldn't be punished for not pooping in the potty. some kids feel that their poop is a part of them and they are sad to flush it. start off with giving him his diaper but only let him go in it while he's in the bathroom. when he's done dump the poop in the toilet and flush it to show him that's where poop goes. after doing this for a few days cut a hole in his diaper and sit him on the potty with his diaper on. he'll go and the poop will go in the toilet but he'll think he's going in his diaper. after a few days of this try letting him go normal with no diaper. good luck!|`|Y6jOPMboaa	WHY DONT U JUST BEAT THE LIVIN ^#@! OUTTA HIM RIGHT OVR THE POT|`|GuzZdOEWaa	When my son turned two I started potty training him. He was fully potty trained by 32 months. It can be very frustrating.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds horrible but everytime my son pooped in his underwear I made a big deal about us having to put his Diego or Spiderman underwear in the trash. (I wouldn't really throw them away) Then I would strip him down and put him in the bathtub. He is so scared of the shower but I wouldn't turn on the shower I would just turn on the water normally (which he is also terrified of) and make him stand while I cleaned him. I seriously only had to do this maybe five times. <br>  <br>  I don't know if your son is scared of the shower but if he is you might give this a try.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	He will go potty when he gets ready.<br>  <br>  You trying to make him when *you* are ready is an uphill battle that results in lots of therapy for him later.<br>  <br>  Do you know any 7 year olds who don't use the restroom? Neither do I. Give him some time, don't pressure him. You may want to make a request that he tries it from time to time and if he says no, no big deal. <br>  <br>  Then there'll be no tension around it. Some kids go through a transition period when they'll alternate between using the toilet and using the diapers, depending on their involvement in play etc. and eventually move on to the toilet. <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, deal with your feelings around it on your own, then from time to time make an offer and let him choose without attachment.
W1p6LetFaa	Sperm can live in a woman for about 7 days.  Low sperm count has nothing to do with it.  The egg has about a 3 day window to be fertilized.  So there is about a 10 day window in there in which conception can happen.  I don't know how long it takes a sperm to reach an egg, but that doesn't really matter because it takes a few days for the egg to travel down to the uterus for implantation after it is fertilized anyway.|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, ok Female sperm can live inside a woman for up to 7 days.Male sperm lives for 24-48 hours only. During this time the egg can only be fertilised at some point during her fertile window which is 48 hours long so I would say that the egg is alive for 48 hours maximum outwith this time there is no chance of conception, or should I say no chance that conception outwith this time would result in a pregnancy that can be carried to term.<br>  <br>  It can take up to seven days after intercourse for sperm and egg to join and become a fertilized egg. Usually, it's because the sperm gets into the fallopian tube before the egg is released.
qf769Z0zaa	Probly there is always a chance if he isn't wearing a condom.|`|U4JEgNPNaa	Since he wasnt wearing a condom the entire time, yes you can get pregnant. Does not take much to make a baby.<br>  <br>  Should have thought about protection a whole lot sooner than after doing it for a couple minutes.|`|8V39PymEaa	take a test|`|3w7VztEWaa	You should always be aware that pregnancy is a possibility every time you have sex. you just have to wait it out and take a test once you feel symptoms.|`|e8259d706e4c0ff624821e09f8c00d53aa	If he doesn't wear a condom the entire time you should be worried. They only work when they are on.<br>  <br>  And how hard is it to spell out the word pregnant?|`|PumDOQC9aa	Period comes onces a month so if you got your on feb 2 . Den your okay .wait till next month.|`|a4425cb924e3c247c83939df65dec03aaa	Well its kinda hard to say. Anytime that u have unprotected sex ur taking a risk. Now if u really only had sex (unprotected) for no longer than a few minutes than in my book more than likely u wouldnt have a problem but then u always have a chance. So for now just keep track of ur period and try to use protection. If you feel that your period isnt coming when it is due then test n see. Hope that helps ya.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	theres always a chance ... even if he didnt ejaculate in you, men do release minimal amounts of sperm prior to reaching an orgasm.  Try to relax and not worry about it because stress will only delay your period.  Take a test a week or so after you're due for your next period.|`|zmpk29BLaa	yes you should be worried about being prego!<br>  <br>  Thats a speghetti sauce! I'd be freaking out if I turned into a can of Prego.|`|xrNzLYhAaa	I don't believe you should worry.
T62wmtv5aa	You can sometimes tell the gender before 18 weeks but you are taking a big chance that it could be wrong. I never tell any of my pts until they are 18 weeks because boys and girls can look the same before this point. All babies start out with what is called a genital tubercle which will look like a penis. At around 12-15 weeks this will start to retract if it is a girl. So we always wait until 18 weeks to tell pts so that it is 100% boy or girl. You don't want to plan on a boy the whole pregnancy and end up with a girl or visa versa. Hang in there it is only 5 more weeks.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	If they are finding out via ultrasound it is between 18 and 20 weeks. Even then though, there are times when they can't tell for sure. They can tell earlier through amniocentesis. although that is not done in every pregnancy. They have to have a good reason to do that. Also that is a definite answer, unlike the ultrasound which can be wrong. I know it is hard to wait, but it is worth it! Congratulations!|`|hhocL3aWaa	It is best to wait until 18 weeks if you can.  That way, they are less likely to make a mistake, which might upset you.  I was also feeling like I was going to have a boy.  Then I found out she is a girl, and I have become so attached to her since I found out.|`|SnJVwA95aa	Here is a really good overview on this topic:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_genitals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_...</a> <br>  <br>  Ideal time is at least 18 weeks, and after you see these pics you will see why. Good luck!|`|KMtd5gr0aa	I would wait tell ur 18 weeks or more. This way they can be more sure then anything. Getting a gender ultra sound early is kinda a waste of time.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	i found out at 17w but i was told 16w sometimes|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	18 weeks no ealrier than 16 and that might not work|`|W1p6LetFaa	I would not trust what they tell you that early on!  I had an ultrasound at 13 weeks and they told me it was a boy, only to tell me at my 20 week ultrasound that it was a girl!  I've had another ultrasound since then and it's definitely a girl.  Since then, I've done my research and apparently it's not accurate to even guess at the gender until at least 16 weeks, but 18 weeks is usually the earliest they should look or else it's too likely that they will be wrong!  I don't know why my ultrasound tech even had the guts to guess at the gender at 13 weeks if this is so commonly known... <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!!|`|HM0cxcahaa	14 weeks it is sometime hard to tell if a girl is a boy and vice versa as the clitorus in a fetus is the same size as a penis...18 weeks is correct. Hang in there!|`|AuyBdlcYaa	It depends... sometimes the babies aren't cooperating and sometimes they are. It is sometimes different. Congrats on being a mommy!|`|kT7GVOosaa	they tell you 18 weeks because the chances of finding out before that are a lot smaller. sometimes it just happens on accident. if you had an ultrasound  last week then chances are they wont schedule you another one until 18 weeks.|`|BiRujg8Baa	About 5 months...I was the same way I had 2 wait till 6 months becuz they didn't have any other date open b4 u know it it will be here
6Smd54ceaa	They take the fetus out at a late stage, before it is a born baby.<br>  <br>  I don't have a problem with late term abortion.  There are too many people in the world.

8j5imUGFaa	Okay. I know on here it says I'm a guy but I'm using my husband's screen name. I got pregnant when I was 20 and in college. The same thing happened to me.  I missed three periods and was on birth control(though I was taking birth control initially because I was never regular), then I started having to pee a lot, had soreness, etc. I took a preg. test early on (after I missed my first period) and it was negative, so I thought nothing of it.<br>  <br>  Three months in I noticed that my middle area (waist) was getting "thick" kind of, like my pants didn't quite fit, but I didn't understand why because I was dieting. Then I had to pee ALL the time and was really sore after working late shifts (I was a waitress). So I took the test again and it was positive. I guess I took the test too soon the last time for the hormones to read correctly.<br>  <br>  The guy (now my husband) and I had broken up right after I got pregnant, so telling him three months later was really hard. Regardless, we had Ethan who is now four and is healthy and happy. It was a very stressful, scary time for us (my father is a Baptist preacher, of all things!) but we worked through it, finished college (we were basically broke for four years), and now I couldn't imagine our lives any other way!<br>  <br>  You need to take a test. I know after taking the test the second time and it coming back positive I took it three more times because I was in shock.  I wouldn't really say it's implantation bleeding, because you said you've had light periods twice now, and if it were implantation bleeding it would have happened once (when the baby implanted).  BUT a friend of mine got pregnant and ended up having "light" periods until she was six months along (and she was on the pill too)!<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people might advice you to abort, but I'm telling you, give the child a chance. Educate yourself before you do something drastic.<br>  <br>  www.silentscream.org<br>  www.abort73.com<br>  www.lifedynamics.com<br>  www.prolifetraining.com <br>  www.prolife.com|`|AA10539883	im not really in a position to tell you that, because i don't know about women accidental pregnancies, but i could say that taking the test would be a good idea.<br>  there was a story on the news that i heard about a woman that was very overweight. but since she was overweight, she didn't realize she was gaining because she was also on a diet at the same time. she went to the doctor, and they told her she was pregnant. 2 or 3 days later, she was in the hospital, giving birth. luckly, the baby was perfectly fine, and even though she probably slept with men while she was pregnant, nothing happened to the baby!|`|I8nIewQHaa	Well you might have had light periods because of eating poorly and if you stressed that can do it to. Just take a test to be sure. |`|oxxBmhV0aa	my friends mom didnt find out she was pregnant until she was 5 months..|`|b331c863ffde1665528bcca85bf28493aa	I think it is possible. Take a test to be sure specially if your period was regular. One of my friends was overweight and didn't know she was pregnant till she was 7 months pregnant. She is married so it wasn't really a big deal to her but was definitely a big shock.|`|87aaa913187cc3fe3f07bec9f3ee49a2aa	take a pregnancy test. its possible, I had a friend that a had period three times before she realized that she could be pregnant. but not taking pills, then taking them or starting over a birth control can throw your hormones all over the place and cause light periods.|`|r6cMy8lcaa	take a test and then you'll have your answer. I watched a show on discovery health about women how didn't know they were pregnant, just went into labor and were like "oh my god, I was pregnant!" so it's possible. I knew I was pregnant all three times right away. |`|Hv6sGOt8aa	Like the other answer, a test will tell you for sure...tonight.  If you are, stop the pill ASAP.  Yes, you can be 3 months and not know, my sis in law claimed that.  Also, it might just be the pill "lightening" your period.|`|9Fz5A67kaa	light periods could be because of the pill. it's actually happened to people. i read a story once, actually on here about someone who had no idea until she started getting a round belly. crazy huh? take a test! good luck|`|95TQYETXaa	there is actually a show called i didnt know i was pregnant, these ladies didnt know untill they went into labor.. one lady even gave birth in a toilet!!!<br>  take a test or see your doc!!|`|hg5Li3vXaa	My mother in law didn't know she was pregnant with my husband until she was 3 months. Take a test. Good Luck.|`|oKQtn3Lnaa	take the test I was on the pill and found out that I am 14 weeks  just this week!!|`|UhIKC0kWaa	Yes! I was 4 months when I found out that I was pregnant. |`|3Z8eZdMcaa	Watch the DHC show. Good luck! |`|Rzsudrzqaa	Its very possible.<br>  No way of knowing until you've had a test. You really should take the test a.s.a.p. since you've been eating poorly. |`|AA11987492	Yes, I was 11 weeks when I found out<br>  <br>  but if you are really worried about it then just go to the store and buy a test
cY8DgJv5aa	I have a daughter the same age.  She has a couple shows she likes, but doesn't actually sit and watch the whole thing.  The older and younger boys are the same way though.  Fine with me though, there are better things theye could be doing than watching the boob tube.  I understand needing a minute to just be able to sit, but that doesn't mean that he has to entertain himself with t.v.  Try letting him sit with some crayons and paper, or offer a new toy (or one from the closet that he hasn't seen in awhile).  There are LOTS of things that my kids are fine doing by themselves for a few minutes while I take a breather.  <br>  <br>  One trick I've learned is asking all the kids to round up their sippy cups (it seems like they hoard those things.  lol).  It takes them a good 10 minutes to find them all.  lol  I set a timer and have them find as many cups as they can within a certain time.  Its a game to them, yet I'm just sitting down relaxing for a couple minutes.  At the end of the 'game', they each get new fresh sippy cups full of their favorite drink and I get to wash all the dirty ones.  Its a win-win situation really.<br>  <br>  **My 2.5 year old also doesn't nap anymore.  If she's really tired, she'll lay down on the couch for a few minutes and watch whatever I'm watching.  Either that, or load her and our youngest son into the stroller while our eldest rides his bike.  The two younger ones get to sit quietly and relax for half an hour or so.  The oldest gets tons of exercise riding his bike and I get a great work-out in as well.  That's an idea (weather permitting of course) if you just want him to relax for a bit.  Other than that, yes, my eldest has started asking to watch more and more t.v. as he's gotten older.|`|KmC0K59taa	This is a GOOD thing.  Too much TV is bad for kids.  Mine is 2 and she has no interest in TV.  I'd much rather her be drawing, coloring, or reading.  I'd rather her be running around the house getting into everything than staring at the idiot box!<br>  <br>  Give him a coloring book or a puzzle or something new to get him to sit still for a few while you are busy.  Give him a snack.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	I wish my 2 year old didn't like TV, we're always limiting her time in front of it and finding it increasingly more difficult.  We'll keep fighting the fight though. TV is one of those childhood addictions that really is no good.  Advocates of TV will say it's great and eductional etc. but all studies point to the contrary.  Threre is no active learning taking place.  Consider yourself lucky.  Instead of TV fill her world with books, puzzles, games and toys ... and encourage her to interact with themm ... get into them yourself too.<br>  <br>  Burn your TV!!!!!!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	why not give him a coloring book to draw in or something like this? im sure he likes to do something for an extended amount of time just figure out what that is.|`|sLkruqYVaa	i understand what u re going through because it s hard to feel like you don t get a second to yourself but uf your child just isn t interested in tv then there s nothing u can do to change, his/her mind try finding another quite occupation that meens you can sit down or have a coffee.like drawing or books<br>  <br>  wow there are some righteous people on here|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Why would you want your kid to watch TV? Its horrible all the things they play now on it, why don't you have him play out side with a dog or something. Its better than a tv... I mean look at the bright side, your kid would be doing its home work rather than watching tv and fighting you about it.<br>  <br>  You should be grateful.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I don't think it has anything to do with her hating it or not. I think it's a lack of a long attention span. I have watched a friend's four year old girl,and she's the same way. I could put on her favorite movie,but if she's not coloring or having a toy on her lap,she just gets up and runs around the house looking for something to do.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My oldest wouldn't watch any TV at all until she was about 18 months old and then she started to watch a couple Elmo videos that we had.  Shortly thereafter, she started to like Sesame Street and moved on to other programs.  My 18-month-old will watch bits and pieces of things, but he certainly doesn't sit to watch a whole show, and I don't imagine he will anytime soon because he's just too busy.<br>  <br>  I know it's frustrating that you can't find anything to do on your own, but at least he isn't addicted to TV like some other kids, right?  Are there other activities that he gets absorbed in -- coloring, play-doh, playing with trains/cars, etc.?  Maybe you could do one of those things (or try some new activity) and it would give you a few minutes of peace here and there.
3VSuyjeGaa	My husband was the same way with our first pregnancy.  Both the dr and I tried to explain it was perfectly safe, but he just wouldn't budge on it.  I felt the same way you did as we literally had sex MAYBE twice during that time.  He was a little better with my second pregnancy and with this pregancy he has been fine.  I think after the first he realized pregnancy can seem to last a really long time.  I am glad that he still is showing you affection because without that it really would be a blow to the self esteem.  All I can recommend is time and education.  Good luck.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Tell him to quit being full of himself :)  Just kidding<br>  <br>  My boyfriend's two co-workers (guys) were both shocked that we were still having sex while I'm pregnant. I guess both of them refused it too because they thought they were going to hurt the baby.<br>  <br>  Tell your husband that sex is very soothing for the baby, it will rock him/her to sleep :)|`|25d466c75995ead18acb403dca51e574aa	Oh honey, I know your pain. My husband wouldn't TOUCH me for the last 3 months, and it makes you feel lonely, ugly, and all the other negative feelings that suck when you are pregnant because they are magnified. His excuse was he didn't want to hurt ME. Have you and the Dr tried explaining and showing him a diagram or model of a pregnant woman, and how it impossible for him to touch the babies head? Have you tried telling him how lonely you are? It may not seem like it will help, but that may be the push that he needs. Good luck!
ZDC81VjZaa	When Using A Pregnancy Test According To Directions<br>  <br>  According to most manufacturers, home pregnancy tests are about 99% effective when used as instructed. That's about the same accuracy rate as most urine pregnancy tests performed in a doctor's office. The tests are available in most pharmacies and do not require a prescription.<br>  <br>  One advantage of the tests is that they allow you greater privacy and flexibility in finding out the results. You can take them anywhere there's a bathroom, and they generally take only a few minutes.<br>  <br>  home pregnancy tests consist of placing a drop of urine on a prepared chemical strip or placing the strip in the urine stream. The strip is designed to detect a pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).<br>  <br>  hCG is released into the body by the placenta when a woman is pregnant. This hormone is also responsible for causing some of the initial symptoms of pregnancy such as breast tenderness and nausea.<br>  <br>  hCG levels usually become detectable in the urine about 10 days after conception. If you take a urine pregnancy test less than 10 days after conception, a home pregnancy test may give a false negative response. This means it will show you are not pregnant when you in fact are.<br>  <br>  Experts say women should wait 5-10 days after their period is officially late before taking the tests to ensure accuracy. If the test is negative, wait a few more days. If menstruation still doesn't begin, take the test again and see your doctor if you have more questions. Not all pregnancy tests are identical and some are more sensitive than others, detecting lower levels of hCG. The smaller the amount of hCG the test measures, the earlier it can detect your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips to follow when taking a home pregnancy test:<br>  <br>  Use your first morning urine when possible (when hCG levels are most easily detected). If not, make sure your urine had been in your bladder for at least 4 hours. <br>  Do not drink excessive amounts of fluids before the test to increase the volume of urine. This could dilute the hCG levels. <br>  Read the directions included in the test thoroughly before starting the test and follow every step precisely. <br>  Some fertility drugs or other medications may interfere with the test results. Check the package labeling for information. <br>  In addition, if there is a problem with the pregnancy, such as an ectopic pregnancy (when the fertilized egg settles in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus), hCG levels may be low and non-detectable by a home pregnancy test. See your doctor if you are unsure about the test's results.<br>  <br>  Blood Tests for Pregnancy <br>  <br>  Blood tests to detect pregnancy are rarely done as a routine measure because they are expensive, and the same results can be obtained from a urine test.<br>  <br>  A blood test to detect pregnancy may be done in special circumstances, such as for women who are undergoing infertility treatment or when a problem is suspected.<br>  <br>  Blood tests are slightly more sensitive than the urine tests and can detect very small levels of hCG. That means they can provide a more accurate answer very early on in the pregnancy, within about 7-12 days after conception.<br>  <br>  The test requires sending the blood sample to the lab for analysis and may take anywhere from a few hours to more than a day to get the results.<br>  <br>  A doctor may also choose to use a blood test to correlate hCG levels as the pregnancy progresses since hCG levels usually double about every 2 days during the first few weeks of pregnancy. If the levels don't rise, it may indicate a problem with the pregnancy. Extremely high hCG levels may mean a woman is carrying twins.<br>  <br>  For piece of mind - you could call your pharmacy and see if they have an over the counter Early Detection kit available.  It will let you know within 6 days before your period is missed that you are pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  If you're NOT pregnant... remember this moment and take better care in the future.|`|8j7FCEOraa	At home Urine pregnancy tests, although i've heard of cases where it's been wrong, is apparently very accurate according to my doctor.<br>  But blood tests that you have to see a Doctor for, are apparently 100%. They will tell you for sure what the answer is.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you will need to wait at least 2 weeks after the sex OR until her missed period [most accurate is 2/3 days after missed period].|`|uLeXGHnKaa	It's way too soon to tell. Pregnancy tests work by dectecting the amount of HCG present in her urine, which only builds up after an egg implants. It can take up to a week for an egg to implant, and even if it implanted more quickly a week wouldn't be enough time for enough HCG to build up to a level a urine pregnancy test could detect. Your best bet is to wait and see if she misses her period and then test. Just because the tests you have taken so far said no it does NOT mean she is not pregnant.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	you dont' say or not whether they come out positive or negative. they are 99.9% effective... after a certain amount of time... probably gonna have to wait a week or 2|`|GEyJMsaKaa	You are supposed to wait two weeks after unprotected sex.....and it doesn't matter if you pulled out or not she still has a good chance of being pregnant.<br>  <br>  Wait another week and take a pregnancy test again|`|52otNiElaa	Someones in denial.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	they are pretty accurate if taken at the right time. a week after sex is most likely too soon since implantation takes 7-10 days to happen after ovulation. so, for example, she didnt ovulate till thursday or friday you would have to wait a minimum of 7 days from that point to test. because most people dosnt know when they ovulate, its best to test the day a period is due if it dosnt show.<br>  Blood tests are more accurate then urine, and can be taken before a urin test can, but again, no test will be accurate untill after implantation happens.|`|a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	A blood test can tell if you are as little as 10 days pregnant and if you are worried about it stop having unprotected sex. I don't understand you people why would you get off in her unless you are ready to marry her and raise a family.|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	99% in most cases if administered correctly and it may be too early to tell with a standard test.<br>  <br>  p.s. if you are that worried about it maybe you should keep it in your pants.|`|hLYugukUaa	omg you are so stupid, " I pulled out" hahahaha<br>  I hope she's pregnant and I hope the kid resents you<br>  people like you are the reason the world is so overpopulated.|`|COhYuTj3aa	The tests are extremely accurate in this time range.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	I think most urine tests are 99% accurate.|`|uRbwPRypaa	They are quite accurate especially the blood test.And no I don't think it was too early to tell|`|v2vkBpsQaa	A lot of tests can give you good results up to 5 days before your missed period. They're most accurate after you've already missed your period but if you take it a day before I'd say it is pretty accurae. I would get a pack with 2 tests in it so you can test tomorrow and a couple of days later. One good sign of pregnancy is a missed period so since you haven't technically missed one yet it's always hard to know.|`|PGXSnq2faa	i'm no doctor but when i got pregnant i was in shock i couldn't believe it i was told that it wasn't very likely to have false positives because the test is made to look for a certain hormone in the urine. but don't start to worry yet wait till she misses her cycle or test a few days before she should start and take more than one, cross your fingers and hope for the best.|`|CwUvYu66aa	the only accurate thing to do is to see a doctor. cause no at home tests can be 100% correct. good luck!
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	The only option you really have is to go to the ER and tell them that you don't want that test done again because you had a miscarriage last time. Other then that all you can do is wait until the doctors office is open. I'm sorry and I hope everything is okay. God bless you!|`|AA10924621	try to call your doctor's office, don't they have someone on call that can call you back?? Maybe call the hospital and just ask. I woudl say rest a lot and don't do anything at all until you hear from your doc. I hope things work out ok.|`|v3LnJycKaa	Sweetheart even if there is a chance of miscarriage there isnt anything they can do, the best for you to do is relax stay hydrated and try not to worry to much. <br>  <br>  best of luck love
VKQzj4Pmaa	Because they are more fun. It's easier to be witty and light-hearted when writing something fun. So one, it's easy. Two, it's fun.<br>  <br>  Serious questions are intimidating to people, because they really have to stop and think. Giving a good answer to something serious is not an easy thing to do, and so it is easier to avoid them. Plus, they can be time consuming, and some people just like to keep on the move, even on Yahoo.<br>  <br>  I will answer light-hearted questions as well as serious questions, but I will ignore the foolish ones, and so should everyone else in my opinion. It only encourages them when we do.|`|prqrQcd1aa	morbid curiosity?? I don't know. Trolls tend to try to get a rise out of people, some times we are bored, so we just go ahead and answer. It doesn't take that long to answer either. Some answers we don't answer because we simply don't know what exactly to say, other questions we do answer and then get jumped for our opinions on how to help people who have posted questions about say.. How to deal with a child that won't listen.|`|AA12221392	I have thought the very same thing. I find it very dishearting when I am really looking to get some real feedback of different views or situtations that could be helpful to someone or myself. <br>  <br>  I guess as you say, it is more interesting to answer a trolls question, then give someone some real advice on love and life with children. <br>  <br>  Maybe instead of parenting we should call this section  trolls r us lol|`|PPd6T0BCaa	Because at the end of the day people only answer to gain the stupid 3 points reward, it is quicker and easier to answer a stupid irrelevant question rather than a serious one. Also some people like to be funny, I am not very funny so I only like to answer questions seriously.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I hope you aren't mad at me for asking goofy questions lately.  Because I have the same concern as you do.  Besides I think I'm awesome and even my silly questions deserve more attention than the lame ones.  :)<br>  <br>  I feel the same way as you.  Which is why I started taking this site more lightly.|`|IARYnu6zaa	Because a large number of people are only on here to get points or to kill tiem when bored, no one really gives two shits about helping people :/|`|PBI3tCKaaa	I do not know, and while I like to have just as much fun as the next person it is annoying when you are really concerned about something and only three people answer.|`|aAPkpuhqaa	maybe because they are easier to answer?|`|xWg1krzBaa	I have no clue I normally try to answer ones of importance, maybe it's because people mostly answer by experience so they choose their questions accordingly.  There are a lot of teenagers and immature people on here and they can only speak what they know.  I don't see a problem with light hearted questions I do however despise that ignorant questions.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Haha because people answer the troll ones with "ok" or something easy, Its a very easy two points.<br>  I try to answer the serious questions if I can, I like to help people even if it takes more time to write out a good answer!|`|AMiQ1dlgaa	what u talk about|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Because trolls do it for the shock value and ANYONE can answer a troll's question.  It takes little to no thought (or intelligence!) to say "You're a troll, this is a ridiculous question".<br>  <br>  To actually give a thoughtful answer requires work.  I suppose that could be why.  Some days I love the thought provoking questions but I am too tired to think about a good answer.  I just star them if that's the case, lol.<br>  <br>  *I will add to what Jen M said.  Sometimes a goofy question is nice to give your brain a chance to recoup from the thought provoking ones :-)|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Because it takes a certain amount of intelligence to answer Intelligent questions.<br>  <br>  Those with out the necessary information to answer the more difficult questions tend to give "troll" answers or skip them completely.<br>  <br>  Another good question is why to some "askers" ask such stupid questions... to get a "troll' answer.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It makes me wonder sometimes too. Or the obvious troll questions that people do answer seriously - you'd think that they'd be able to pick up on it, since often it's the same people posting the same questions day after day. Maybe they're newer users and don't notice; but if you read their profiles (which are often blocked if they're trolls, though) you'll see it all right there!<br>  <br>  Sometimes you will get totally different answers if you post a question in more than one section, but I doubt that's the case with some of these people. They just want attention, or think they're being funny, I guess. But some of them seem serious, which makes me think they've gone off their medication, maybe. LOL|`|SnQvsOPwaa	In a lot of the serious questions the answer is to change the parenting style. Parents don't want to be told their doing it wrong. I now skip these questions because the real answers just piss everyone off.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	thats been frustrating me since almost day 1 of joining this site.  its not even silly ones that get the responses its the down right ridiculous ones that get responses.<br>  i'm w/the lack of thought as the reason.|`|AA11210211	I have wondered this too,I have asked numerous serious questions and only get 5 to 10 answers??
cErLq7f3aa	i would pronounce it ian but i don't know if that's really right.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	There is someone in my year at school called Ean, and he pronounces it AY-an.|`|29poEtX4aa	Yeah I'd assume it can only be pronounced as Ian, otherwise it would be eh-an

8e5YBwd7aa	He OBVIOUSLY LIKES YOU!<br>  and hed probably dump her for you any day ;)!<br>  Flirt back!<br>  & Don't hide it its obvious you have a little thing going for him to Girl ;)|`|93TC1Yxlaa	Sounds like this guy likes you but if he's playing around and has a girlfriend, steer clear.  You can still be friends, but he doesn't seem like the best candidate for anything other than that.<br>  <br>  Don't over-think this thing.  If his girlfriend doesn't like you, that's her problem not yours.  Who cares?|`|EBz43tzfaa	just keep actin the way u normally act.  he likes you, and obviously liked u the way you were so dont change a thing because he fell in love with the old you..and yea he does like you.|`|BvE0qcgmaa	Doesnt sound like a good guy. I would just be friends at the most if i were you.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Seems like he likes you or is just a player.|`|HuXAcy6Qaa	sounds like a player. You shouldn't be around these types of guys|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Probably because maybe he talks about how he likes you to her. Either that or his girlfriend is sitting behind him seeing what he's writing and he's trying to make her mad. Or his ego is just huge. Next time he starts talking to you and starts saying those things, say things like, "I don't like you like that, you have a girlfriend and you if you're going to say those things, you need to stop talking to me." If he says something like, "I don't care what she thinks" or something like that, print it out and show his girlfriend that shows you want nothing to do with him and she needs to confront him about something like that.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I don't like the way this guy sounds. He's putting words into your mouth and telling you how you feel.....Something isn't right about this guy!|`|AA12088442	whooa that was umhhh weird... yeh|`|p7izYNBpaa	hes a guy.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	Hes a player .... i delt with that before! <br>  My advice is stay away from him ....<br>  cause just as easily as he would dump her for you, he would dump you for some other girl. Trust me ... its sucks!|`|w6tQEuKCaa	hes flirting with you|`|E6T9DPT9aa	he's trying to flirt with you...<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:
7rCeCVl2aa	My dog LOVES to ride in the car with me but I NEVER bring him with me when it's hot and I will be going in to the store. I live in NW Ohio and it is well known for reaching temps in the 100's along with severe humidity. Spring, fall and winter he is my Co-Pilot though.<br>  <br>  I know I would be miserable left in a locked car dressed in shorts and a tank top... A dog has to be even more miserable covered in a coat of fur.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you. I bet she doesn't leave her dog in the car again!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	If it were a pet I would call police too. I probably wouldn't shatter the window though. My reasoning for calling the police would be that I would want her to never do that again and hopefully she would be punished. <br>  <br>  A dog locked in a car i urgent but not the same degree of emergency as a baby in a car IMO.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I would have called 911 and tried to break the window.<br>  <br>  In the time it takes to get someone out there the dog could have been dead.|`|zwctZ812aa	There's this extremely crazy lady that works in my office building that has two little bischon dogs.  Up until last summer, she brought them with her to work every day since she started here, which was about this time last year.  She would leave them in the car, and go walk them around the pond in front of our building on breaks or lunch.  I live in northern california and it gets HOT here.  We had to call the humane society 8 times before they finally came out to investigate.  The day they came was in July and it was 113 outside and she had left those poor puppies in the car all day!  Needless to say they were taken from her. Anyways, just thought I'd share my story...we tried talking to her without reporting her numerous times, but like I said, she was crazy!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i think the same principles/laws about leaving a child in the car should apply to pets as well. they are living creatures that can suffer from the heat just as well. i have seen it happen and it makes me very sad. i live in so cal as well and its been up to 136 degrees before where i live. and it gets even hotter inside a car.|`|50lIaC8zaa	Pets shouldn't be left in a car/van or anything when its hot and if it is absolutely necessary for a short period of time a window should be left open enough for the pet to not overheat and water should also be left for the animal to drink.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i think that is horrible!<br>  just because the poor dog can tell her he's hot, then people think he must not be.. omg.<br>  i would have called the police. that is just ridiculous.<br>  lucky, i have never seen anyone leave an animal in a car in such hot weather.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	i personally think its wrong for people to live pets in the cars. people may think pets are just pets, but they aren't. they have feelings, and dogs can be a persons bestfriend.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lol, I'm not so adamant about dogs. I'd probably mind my own business. There probably just running in on the way home from the vet or whatever.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Pets should not be left in the car.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Why don't people just leave their pets at home?|`|zFbhYl1Baa	same answer, minus soc ser|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	I think it's absolutely horrible when people do that. Many people consider their pets as their children. I would actually call the Humane Society or the ASPCA and have them come get the dog out of the car. In many states leaving a dog in a car in extreme weather is considered a form of animal abuse and they can have the pets taken away and/or given fees. So i'd definitely call. I have in the past and i'd do it again.|`|Emw1PBqXaa	Well if it is really hot out you really should not even if you park in the shade with the windows cracked and water for them. It gets really really hot in the car in the summer! But if it is in the fall or winter time (above 30) then I don't see a problem if it is not very long and they have water to drink. By not very long I mean running into the store 15 minutes tops. But a lady having lunch. She should have brought her dog in, in her purse then or left it home.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I have paged people many times in stores because I saw a dog in a hot car. It took a lot of self control not to punch them.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	pets shouldnt be left in the car either.<br>  basically any animal, person, baby that can't make their own decision whether or not they want to stay in the car, shouldnt be left in the car. <br>  Now if a 13 yr old tells you he wants to wait in the car, tehn hey let him.

vOFdHvlvaa	My sis's twins were born at 36 weeks and were 4 pounds even and 4/1/2 pounds, but for a single baby who is 34 to 35 weeks it really depends on alotta factors, like how big or small the mom is, if big or small babies run in the family, stuff like that.  I'd say on average a baby born at 34 to 35 weeks is prolly around 5 to 7 pounds, it could be smaller though, esp. if ur smaller or smaller babies run in the family or it could be bigger, prolly not but she could be.<br>  I'd ask the doc what the average is though, since he's a medical professional he could tell u better than anyone.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	My daughter was born at 35 weeks and weighed in at 6lbs 8ozs.

I would say average is about 6lbs and some odd ounces.|`|A4ETov2Qaa	probably around 4-5 pounds just depends on if big babies run in the family|`|rFXt8ygGaa	i hav twins their were born at 36 weeks and they weighted 4.1 and 4.6lb         but 34-35 iam not sure|`|JEOWwUELaa	ask your doctor.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	It varies from 5-10 lbs.

eDfh1yhYaa	The day our son turned 3 months we put him in the Jolly Jumper. He had colic and we found that being having him able to be in an upright position helped in bring up wind and also strengthen his neck muscles. Apart from that it was his first chance at Independence being able to swing around and look at the world from another angle all on his own.. he loved it for the first bounce.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would recommend Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo which is designed for use by a child who is able to hold his or her head up unassisted, and who is not yet able to climb out or walk, this baby jumper delights baby with interactive play options and stimulating movement to help encourage healthy development.<br>  Weight Capacity is 25 pounds. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/jumperoo-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/jumperoo-20</a>|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I think they told me at my son's daycare he had to be 5 months old.

3F8f1SoQaa	i usually use free family when I need a sitter ( thanks mom). I think $5-7 an hour would be about right for that age though.|`|BySnX7Gvaa	I am a baby sitter 14 been babysitting since i was 11 i watch (NOW) a 14,11,9,2,10months for one family 5 dollars an hour 5,2 10 dollars per hour and a 2 year old 10 dollars and hour.......i baby sit them at their house not mine and i get paid for when they are sleeping i would say between 5-10 dollars per hour probally 7 cause you will be gone for a while|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I get paid 7 dollars an hour but I'm 18, CPR certified, have a lot of experience, etc. I would say to pay her 5 dollars (maybe 6) an hour since she's young, the kids will probably be sleeping, and since she is your neighbor. <br>  <br>  That's just the going rate in my area right now. It depends on where you live.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	I would pay no more then $20 because she will mainly be watching them sleep .|`|GeqMrX9laa	i am 15 and for kids of 15 months and 34 months and to watch them for 4 hours i would be okay with 30 dollars.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	about $5 an hr should take care of it.  :)|`|YTgCcvSkaa	I think it depends where you live.  I have noticed, city-sitters get more than rural-sitters.  I pay $3.50 for one child for an hour.  $4.50 for two children an hour.  I asked the sitter to name her price before I hired her.  She said it didn't mattter and I told her to discuss it with her mom , because she should know what she feels her services are worth.  (A good-life lesson.)  Also, I don't over pay and she knows what to expect.  I also round up to the nearest dollar.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|CyeYMaUuaa	It depends on how many kids the sitter would be watching. I have 4 kids, so if it is one kid, then $6.00 an hour. Two-three kids, $7.00 an hour. All four girls, $8.00 an hour.|`|QvV38Igfaa	I would go with about eight to ten dollars an hour.

It smells like.....KARMA|`|5JFG5W4uaa	Christy...you must be very young for this event to have such an affect on you. First off any punishment will be a deterrent for you to not does such a foolish thing again, and having said that, think what the other girl has to go through. The shame and bad feelings she will carry with her all through her life. Take your punishment and consider it a lesson earned. Your mother will not know about this if you keep a good record after this incident.<br>  Spartawo...|`|OLXv3DEAaa	You asked a very similar question months ago.<br>  Are you some kind of pervert, seriously what is your issue?<br>  <br>  Just talk to your mom about it don't do anything without your mom knowing whats going on. If you can't get in touch with her then just go home without the 'lesson'.|`|xWg1krzBaa	You absolutely deserve this, 110%.  I think the "Shy Loser Girl" should be the one to paddle you.  Who are you to assume she is a loser? You know nothing about her.  What I can tell from you is that you're about as shallow as a puddle.  Why on earth would you do that to someone?  Things like that is part of the  reason why there are school shootings, people fold under the pressure of being teased.  Quit being a bully, do some soul searching, grow up and trade places with her.  How would you like to be treated like that? You're disgusting!  Yeah I know it's so cool to pick on each other, lol, wedgies? Are you serious? Straight up bullies!!  You don't have to like everyone that's not going to happen but you have the right to degrade no one.  As an afterthought how would you feel if this girl went home and killed herself?  Maybe something to think about...your actions and words hurt people, you are not a very good person.  Sounds like you're a spoiled brat!  If she makes it through this she will be stronger and a better person than you could ever dream of being!|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Corporal punishment involves getting hit.<br>  There is no guarantee that will happen.<br>  <br>  What you are worried about (having them take your clothes or something) is sexual abuse. That isn't and shouldn't happen.<br>  <br>  There are a number of legitimate punishments that could arise, from forced apology to strenuous exercise (running laps until you can't), to even being hit, all of which are completely legitimate.<br>  <br>  You should be old enough to tell the difference between legitimate corporal punishment and physical/sexual abuse. And you deserve that punishment. Grow up and accept it.|`|QvV38Igfaa	You deserve it. You shouldn't have even tried to pants that poor girl. It doesn't matter if she annoys you, or even if your friends do it, or whatever! You were being immature, and you have to suffer the consequences now.|`|5spXOfSbaa	First of all, you do deserve this. You earned it. My suggestion would be to take the punishment like an adult and then straighten out and fly right.|`|iMtGIiMQaa	you are way out of line for calling this poor girl a loser. how immature are you? DEPANTSING? seriously? yes you do deserve this.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Tell me where this school is and Ill send money to buy extra paddles.|`|AA11622716	You seem to be asking me to speculate about what your punishment will be.  I have no idea.  What you did is considered a crime in every state, including Nevada, and I could tell you that in Nevada it could get you six months in jail, but I have no idea of what consequence is envisioned by your teacher.  I can tell you that it will not do any good as you are still thinking only of yourself, without a thought about what you did to the other girl.  You seem to think it was OK to amuse yourself at the expense of the other girl because she is a loner.  Demonstrate that you have learned what you did was wrong, and why it was wrong, and that will go a long way toward mitigating your punishment.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Well I guess I just found another person who is " rude, crude and very unattractive " <br>  Take your punishment and quit whining.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Good Luck with that. Stop following the "Clicks", and GROW UP. NOW I hope you know how that "Loser Girl" you call, FEELS.|`|YAwvszITaa	sure you do! learn to keep your hands to yourself and grow up|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	How can you call the other girl a loser when you are acting like one.  Making fun of another person reflects more on you than on the person you are doing it to.  You need to start growing up and start thinking of other people besides yourself.<br>  <br>  By the way, what you did is sexual harassment and can have a variety of legal punishments if the "loser" girl chooses to file a complaint with the police.

All kids are different and they all mature at their own speed. You shouldn't worry until he is about 15 to 18 months old. If you are really worried or just curious ask his doctor.|`|npvl9mP0aa	I started walking at a little before a year but I have a sister. And usually if the kid has a brother or sister they start walking earlier because they see them walking.|`|c47717d90449a6bb292419e20a7dab7faa	My daughter started walking at 9 months. That was on her own without something to push or help her.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	My 8 month old is resisting crawling like the plague. He squirms but would rather stand up and bounce.

It will happen when you least expect it.|`|lGcpXteaaa	My daughter started cruising along furniture at 6 months and now at 9 months she has just found the courage to take steps off of the furniture.<br>  Just today she walked more than 5 steps on her own.

After 30 weeks or so the accuracy decreases as the baby gets too big to measure properly. LMP is a guide as everyone has different cycles.|`|65470aa2ce8facaf30f5b1b8daa5af81aa	ultrasound

4ksa4lhWaa	Yes they change there schedules so many times.  Lol<br>  <br>  My son takes power naps all day 15 minutes to 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  Now he's 20 weeks and takes one good nap 1 hour or 2 and couple power naps.

x8JRkRNkaa	I don't believe you can hold a baby too much.

I think that a baby feels safe and secure when you hold them close to them. How many of us adults wish we could have that feeling whenever we want it?|`|p5cYEPASaa	No, never, it gets the baby closer to you!|`|ob3WOb5saa	Not necessarily spoil them, but he will get used to being held and won't like it when he is NOT being held...hence the screaming and crying when you put him down.|`|AA10959670	no for real but when they really are aware of everthing i say 5 months when  they tryna crawl that how i got my lil nephew spoil because every time i pick him up all the time he stops crying|`|D7qJ0c8Zaa	AWWW hold him while you can he will grow older and u m8 not be able 2|`|BzvstX7uaa	Not at that age.|`|i9BgSAMjaa	well im not sure|`|zfvsa0PZaa	yes u can spoil a baby i dont know if u can at that age but if you pick them up the moment they start crying they will think you will do that every time they cry. So my advice is instead up picking them up the moment they start crying try to give them their bottle or binky or toys and if that doesnt work then pick them up, other than that you can never hold a baby too much. I hope I was helpful!|`|waVPtmAEaa	not at that age. Holding a child for too long aften encourages them to walk later in life then most|`|o5piRiBsaa	No, not until 6 months.  So hold him to your heart's desire!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Hold that baby as much as you can you wont get to forever!! :)  Spoil them while you got them! :)  with in reason of course but when your baby is that small they have been cradled in the warmth of your uterus for 9 months they just want to be near you! :)|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  It gives them a sense of security. It is better to pick them up a lot when they are young.  They will be more independent and confident because of it later in life.
fJbWRwsmaa	They do make garbage cans where you press a button on top and it opens. Or you could try putting it in a cabinet (Like under the kitchen sink) with a child lock on it OR you can put it  in the cabinet on runners so it slides out. You can buy a kit for that at Target. It just takes 4 screws. And when its slid in, its too close to the ceiling of the cabinet for the dog to fit his head in. For the bathroom, all I can tell you is ALWAYS flush your tissues and TP. We have the same problem with our dog.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	but something heavy on top of it!|`|gx4s68s8aa	Use a Diaper Champ as your garbage can.  I have never found a dog (and I have four) or a child that can get into one.
33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	You really should use a condom as back up for the rest of this cycle.  I've had many girlfriends get pregnant while on the pill and taking antibiotics.
4p9sBdyTaa	Oh if I were you I would go ahead and buy your big stuff, I already have and I bought extra crib sheets I buy a pack of diapers and wipes each week oh and I have bought a few outfits and blankets.|`|8WbfmK5daa	Wow how have you managed not too have bought her stuff already lol.<br>  <br>  After my first scan at 12 wks when everything was fine we went out and bought her a mose basket, rocker & blankets.<br>  <br>  When I was 17 weeks I found I was expecting a girl and went mad. I was made up so went straight and bought her hundreds and hundreds of clothes.<br>  <br>  By week 24 We had pretty much everything for her from the cot, pram, car seat, mose basket, swing, changing unit, rocker. You get the idea lol.<br>  <br>  I just couldn't resist the temptation. I was too excited :)|`|kw80YHMLaa	Well at 24 weeks and healthy as i presume you are, I'd start buying a few outfits to start with. When i had my little girl i didn't know what i was having so i bought all neutral crib, pram and painted nursery cream     its better not to rely on baby showers as your own personal touch for your baby is better than any present you'll get|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Honey, go shopping while you still can! it's one the fun things about having a baby. You'll probably get clothes and things at a shower, but i would get some of the essentials pretty soon. Cot, mattress, pram, car seat. Let people know what you already have. They'll probably ask you what you need or want.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I started buying things at 25 weeks (when I found out the gender) But I had even bought things earlier than that.<br>  <br>  I bought a playpin, high chair, and things like that. :)|`|cn91FeWcaa	no once u know what ur having start buying things<br>  so far ive bought<br>  onesies<br>  socks<br>  a nike outfit<br>  a timberland outfit<br>  recieving blankets<br>  towels<br>  sleepers<br>  bibs|`|KMtd5gr0aa	I dont think its too early i mean ur 6 months already why not?|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Don't go too crazy just yet. If someone is going to get you a big ticket item, like maybe your mom or your husbands getting you a crib, I'm sure she'd tell you. Just get a couple of really cute outfits, that you know will be perfect later on. Even though you don't want to count on the baby showers for the big or small things, it doesn't mean you won't get them, and you don't want to end up with 2 big items, and the essentials you can never have enough of. Wait until the week after your shower to go shopping, or at least the first one so you can see what you're mostly getting.<br>  I'm in my 7th month and just because I got a gift card to Babies R Us, got some baby towels, diapers, wipes, cute diaper bag before it sold out, really cute bibs, and cute onsies, my shower is next month and knowing them there's no telling what I'll get.|`|T43Ha0OSaa	If you are having a couple of baby showers, I would wait to see what I was getting from there and access what additional things I needed to buy. <br>  <br>  But keep in mind, you will always need diapers, wipes, detergent, and things of that nature, so if you are dying to buy something, then buy essential items.  And if you must buy something additional, make sure you keep the receipt so that you will be able to exchange when necessary.|`|MUEsS8tYaa	I'm 27 weeks pregnant, I have so far restrained myself from buying much, but I did buy a few outfits. Just because I'm so excited, and getting the tiny little clothes made me feel motherly. There is no harm in buying a few small things for your baby girl, it'll feel really good to do so.<br>  Congrats, by the way! :)|`|sdtqTbmoaa	actually i been checking out freecycle..its a great way to get stuff..i got lucky and got a few strollers in great condition for free..all that was wrong was they were faded...its much easier getting stuff here and there then all at once.|`|OxbOAm5Xaa	IT IS NEVER TOO EARLY...OMG lol. and garage sales are awesome to get stuff at.  congrats and good luck!|`|37MvN4YJaa	Its not too early.  Go and Shop!! and have fun!|`|FEzmVmFjaa	I'm 39 weeks now, and I didn't start buying things till LATER in my pregnancy and I wish I wouldn't have waited so long. Everyday there are more and more things I keep forgetting, and my son could be born ANY minute! I kinda feel unprepared! Although, I didn't get to have a baby shower.. I think I would have waited till AFTER the shower to buy alot of it though, cus my sister just had one and got almost everyhting she needs!<br>  But I def. don't think it's ever too early to start being prepared! Cus around your 9th month, it gets VERY hard and tiring to even move!|`|AA10927320	this is what i did i went and bought the cute name brand baby shoes  the absolutlely got to have little outfits like  3 and  bought my crib at 13 weeks now i just bought my bedding and  my dad is making me a changing table cuz i got a bad back and need it to be high   and ive statred to buy things for my shower like center pices and  cokes nacho cheese  and some meat  <br>  <br>  my mom says i have to help her out so im trying little  by little|`|iFmKcRl0aa	It's your baby. I say to have fun with it and shop when you want to! We picked out a few small things the day we found out we were pregnant because we were in the mood to celebrate. <br>  <br>  If you are worried about buying something that someone might give you later, I think you could do a couple things: sign up on a baby registry when it's time to have a shower, or if the person hosting your baby shower asks what you need, give them a list that leaves off the things you'd prefer to get the baby yourself. My husband and I just edited what we put on the "we need" list because wanted some of the baby's things to be special from us.<br>  <br>  I think the Web sites recommended in this article have great advice for buying baby things.|`|4ZQxAvE2aa	I started to buy outfits when I found out the sex of my baby. I am 32 weeks and just had my baby shower last week. We got almost everything we registered for, but you can never have to many diapers, bottles, and outfits. Have fun and congrats.|`|AA11763588	I bought all my large items around 20 week with all 3 of my kids.|`|WHN5cuGZaa	i bought the car seat and the stroller O_O the rest with time you will start geting
81aebce9192db1f478c67109be6a4a43aa	i don't know sometimes ppl make good grades because they are hard working but can't work up to the potential on tests or anything.<br>  <br>  but the way i see it, if you put in hard work you get rewarded and learn things on the way.<br>  <br>  also, some people have to work harder than others for better grades. but who knows<br>  <br>  everyone wants good grades :)|`|cTM07yNwaa	becuase if you have good grades then you do the work you do it right and you know what your doing,<br>  <br>  if you dont have good marks, your not trying, your not that smart, your still learning.<br>  <br>  <br>  you have a point though. but it is just like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  wouldnt you think that a person with 90 percent is smarter then somone woth like 40 percent?|`|clFTA9fDaa	Ughh I hate when people say that!<br>  Like I have a 4.0, and I have my whole life. But I just don't see it as being really smart. Like the stuff we do, isn't hard. It's just about the effort you put into it. So, i guess I'm smart enough to have common sense haha<br>  Idk, I'm obviously not dumb, but it still bugs me when people are like omg your a genius, i wish I sat next to you!<br>  Maybe it just embarresses me...|`|ZPoOSUnNaa	You have to be smart enough to obtain good grades, but hardworking, yes definitely!|`|1s3nddaYaa	ashamed of being smart? and if you make good grades you surely aren't to stupid.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	because usually it does! I get all straight A's (like 4.0) and all of my friends do, but we are smart. Its nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah it gets annoying when people whine about their horrible grades and tell you how lucky you are and yada yada yada, but its better than having to spend time studying very hard and getting tudors and worrying about grades.|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	because in most cases, not all, but most, they go hand in hand. when you get good grades, people assume you are book smart, that's about it.|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	They usually mean you are. Although I know some with good grade that are retarded and my BGF is the samrtest guy ever and gets Bs and Cs.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	because most of the time it does...?<br>  <br>  I see what you're saying, but clearly, it must mean something if a person is straight A or straight F|`|tnQGOsaeaa	Cuz thats what it means.....
HkWTYhjDaa	yes!! until now im on my 17week.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	Not in early pregnancy, but in my second trimester now it's worse then the first. Every woman/pregnancy is different though, so you could very well be experiencing it now. Good luck.|`|422baec93c2e09175c8e2ab1b0c51d3baa	YES. im 5 weeks and horrible gas pains for the last two weeks. didnt experience this when i was pregnant with my son though,
OrKpKxkHaa	What you said is all I know. I'm sure some people do it and their kids are fine but would you really want to take the chance that your son would be the one child to get sick from it? Not me! Good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Because 14% of formula is already contaminated with dangerous bacteria, which multiply the whole time the bottle is at warmer than room temperature and room temperature.  You can't store formula for more than 2 hours at room temp even if it hasn't been consumed<br>  <br>  And because the negative pressure from bottles probably does cause saliva to flow back into the bottle.<br>  <br>  Its also possible that you have gotten a cold from letting a soda with your saliva sit in the fridge.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infactcanada.ca/Newsletters/2007-Winter/safety_guidlines.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infactcanada.ca/Newsletters/2...</a><br>  E. sakazakii is a highly virulent bacteria which is resistant to the high-temperature processing methods used in food production. If infants, especially those who are newborn, low-birthweight or premature, are infected with E. sakazakii, it can cause meningitis, necrotizing entercolitis, and sepsis, and is potentially fatal. As a result of reports of baby deaths from E. sakazakii contamination in recent years the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have declared this a significant public health hazard and have convened two expert meetings on the issue: one in 2004 and more recently in January of 2006. After reviewing the scientific evidence the 2006 meeting produced a report noting that both manufacturers and governments must act to reduce the health risks associated with the intrinsic contamination by E. sakazakii. Studies reviewed by the meeting noted that up to 14 per cent of formula packages may be contaminated by the bacteria.|`|Sz8KiJuvaa	i dont really understand it myself but i feel its better to be safe then sorry. id rather waste the formula and have a higher bill for the formula then risk my baby getting sick from re using formula. that being said ive also heard that as long as the bottle that was started is refrigerated within an hour of being made fresh and then used within an hour of refrigeration it is ok. i havent done this and dont plan to atm but i am just putting it out there. everyone will tell you differently but i chose to listen to my doctor who said dont reuse it after a feeding has already started.|`|lZiwWAjkaa	they suck the formula and when they let go of the nipple even for a second, air releases back into the bottle along with saliva.  <br>  <br>  that's my guess.  I don't have anything against saving formula, i just prefer not to but that's cuz everyone else told me not to.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|0RCGy3OOaa	because then you are required to buy more formula. same reason they put expiration dates on items WAY before they would actually go bad|`|E5CnUdhsaa	saliva does get back down there during the sucking motion, the bacteria in it can be hamful and grow if left.. i wouldt take the chance
ZNhP3mpUaa	NO.
WPI0Z47saa	Actually I know 2 people that this happened to. Both were similar stories. They were messing around and let their boyfriends ejaculate on their vagina. Some people are misinformed and think that you need penetration to get pregnant. All you need is for sperm to be able to get into your vagina.|`|hswTS1jVaa	There are more positions than anal or missionary and if you had sex in another position, yes you could be pregnant and you are not a virgin anymore.<br>  <br>  If you have had NO sex, then you are a virgin and not pregnant.|`|MqFeJiukaa	What are you asking exactly?  Anal sex won't get you pregnant.  If you are having sex in any position you are not a virgin.  Missionary is not the determining factor in virginity...a penis in a vagina is.<br>  <br>  The only way you could get pregnant as a virgin is if some how live sperm got inserted into your vagina or of course if you are Mary.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	You can be pregnant.<br>  <br>  If any sperm comes in contact with your vagina, you can be pregnant.  If you have anal sex, and the sperm "spreads" (for lack of a better word) down, it can get in your vagina and you can be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Any rubbing or touching that can bring sperm in contact with the vagina can cause pregnancy, even if there is NO penetration.|`|0eba68295838279e5b5ab51c0a80eda1aa	You can get pregnant at any vaginal sex. Doesn't matter if you do it missionary or any other possition.<br>  <br>  You can not get pregnant at anal sex. And now, you can of course not get pregnant being a virgin. <br>  <br>  How old are you?!|`|ckgiPMm4aa	You can't get pregnant from anal sex, but you can from any kind of intercourse.<br>  <br>  Oh and that would mean your not a virgin.|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	Actually there is a possibility that a woman can be pregnant and still be a virgin. What is meant by the term "virgin" is that the hymen is not broken. It is possible, though unlikely, to be penetrated but not have that line of tissue broken. Is is also possible, though even more unlikely, that sperm made it's way to an egg. Ejaculation on a girl's stomach, legs, anywhere near the vagina could give sperm the chance the need. VERY unlikely, but still possible.|`|1EsUa8HRaa	If you get any semen near your vagina, you can still get pregnant. It's less likely, but be careful.|`|RakOH0Ptaa	well i seen a true movie bout a girl getting pregnant and still being a virgin!! But they say that happens if the guy ejaculates near your private parts!!|`|EUTRJqCsaa	if his penis came in contact with you without going in then technically yes, there's probably some possibility. but it would be VERY unlikely.|`|on3CVSgWaa	I 100% agree with Nomiscat...You need not have penetration to get pregnant...just semen near your vagina..Sperm are strong swimmers and survivors|`|Khs7HBYmaa	no its  not possible.
hSJnaysiaa	I don't know how to say this but we have like identical lives almost.<br>  <br>  I am 34 weeks pregnant with a boy and have been wondering the same thing. I also nanny, and have nannied for about 3 years. And as a nanny (at least for me) I've sort of learned to not bond with the kids I work with much because its hard on me when the position ends or whatever.<br>  <br>  So I'm worried that I will handle my relationship with my son the same way, I will be loving and kind, but not overly attached and motherly.<br>  <br>  I know he deserves more than that though, so it scares me.<br>  <br>  My fiance also lost his job (just about the time we found out we were pregnant) and went from making $100,000+ per year, to unemployment checks each week of $338 (its actually like $515 but a certain amount is taken out for child support on his other kids so we never see it). I had to take a major cut in pay also to find a position that will allow me to take my son with me, and now we are barely getting by. And my fiances unemployment is almost up...then we don't know what will happen to us.<br>  <br>  I'm just so worried about everything. Finances, the house being dirty (I'm pregnant and work full-time...the house never keeps clean), we also have two dogs and two puppies (who are going to their new homes soon hopefully), my car (my windshield needs replaced and my brakes are needing new rotors but I have a whopping $200 in my bank account, do I fix the brakes with that money or buy heating oil to heat our house (we ran out of oil on Tuesday).<br>  <br>  We have each other, and that's what is important, but our landlord isn't going to care about that, the heat won't magically appear, and each day driving on my brakes is more and more dangerous. <br>  <br>  I hate my job. The baby I watch is almost 3 months old and very sweet, but her parents are totally taking advantage of me and I hate it. With the area we live in though, you take what you can get as far as nanny jobs go.<br>  <br>  I'm just so worried, my blood pressure was pretty high at my last appointment, due to stress I'm sure, but why can't things just be as they were a year ago? When he had a good job, and I had a better job, and we had heat and my car worked well, etc? It just doesn't seem right.<br>  <br>  I love our baby, and I cry all the time about our situation because on one hand he deserves better, but on the other hand he also deserves to know his real parents. I don't want to give him up just because our finances are out of control right now, that could change.<br>  <br>  But I too feel like I haven't bonded. We've got all the baby gear and whatnot, but I'm just so stressed and scared that I haven't allowed myself to bond with him I think, because unless things change we likely won't be able to keep him, and that breaks my heart.|`|yCzQVu5Baa	Dont worry, when the baby is born, you will wonder why you had these thoughts in the first place, its impossible not to once they place them on your chest.|`|62N5DC8qaa	Dont Worry i think you'll be fine , i didn't have those feelings at first but after i had my son was born i slowly became atatched to him ,i didn't know a thing about takeing care of a baby being that i never really was around babys before , i even toke a home parenting class to teach me what to do with my baby and when he was born i was 40, i had a miscaridge at 30 , and never thought i would be a Mom so my son is a miracle to me , good luck to you ...|`|FRwaGpJaaa	You'll bond with her hun. You love her, that's good! Once she is born, you will see her and you will be in awe. A good movie to watch that is sort of like how you are feeling is "The Waitress"
nhgQKvwEaa	I had my second c/section 5 months ago. I waited 2 weeks after, and went at it again. I was no longer bleeding, and felt comfortable enough to do so. I'd say, as long as you're not bleeding & feel up to it then go for it! Just be sure to use protection if you don't wanna get pregnant again (which i don't think you do lol) you can get pregnant really easily after a baby. So yes it's perfectly safe to have sex again now.|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Yup, also got the 6 week wait order from my doctor and followed it. You have a lot more healing to do than you would if you had a vaginal delivery... there are 7 layers of stitches on the inside that needs to heal up too - and 16 days after a c-section you just don't know if everything's all healed up yet. Remember orgasms contract the uterus and your uterus was just cut and sewed back together. You can hurt yourself if you go too fast. I'd say at the very least give it another 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  All that said, the nurse at the well baby clinic told me we can have sex as soon as we both feel comfortable.  <br>  <br>  My friend got pregnant a month after her c-section! Her two youngest are only 10 months apart... lol... so make sure you use birth control.<br>  <br>  Take it slow, and the minute you start to feel uncomfortable, then stop. Of course... there are many other fun things you can do that doesn't require intercourse - so maybe explore those options first and see how you like it. <br>  <br>  Congrats on your little one!|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	No I didnt.  I wanted to have sex really soon after having the baby but bc of my internal stitches I waited. We found other ways to do things until I was healed enough. My dr told me NO sex for 6 weeks. Even tho I waited till then It still hurt the first 3 to 4 times we did have it. Then after it was fine. I wouldnt do it personally. If you do make sure to use something.|`|0viZhxi6aa	I didn't wait very long at all! (5 days, actually!) I had just had my tubal ligation done at the same time and all I could think of for the next two months were..........I really hope it worked! If you're gonna do it, be safe. Not only to prevent pregnancy, but to prevent tearing of your internal sutures. Have fun....................bow chickie wow wow.........lol|`|daK9RlV1aa	I had sex 1 week after! I know horrible but nothing bad happened. I have had 5 kids and have had sex by at least the 2nd week after. But be careful and don't forget you can get pregnant, you will not know when you ovulate until you have your first period after having your kid|`|rmnvkIBXaa	ask the doctor. at your next appointment ask and see what he says. but i would assume if they don't want you exercising and lifting heavy things, that sex would be out of the question.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	My doctor said to wait 6 weeks after delivery but that was for vaginal birth... idk if it would be longer or shorter after a C section... ask your doctor before you do just to make sure you dont pull a stitch out or something|`|r1KS5GsDaa	i had a c-section in the end of august and didnt have sex till the first week of december. over 3 months. its fine as long as drs. dont advise you not to. my dr. did say wait 6 weeks though.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	As long as you are on birth control, because you can get pregnant again!<br>  <br>  (However I think my OB advised me to wait 6 weeks)|`|sAbah6dTaa	we did it before the 4 weeks. <br>  as long as it doens't hurt.<br>  and maake sure you have protection, my little brother and sister are 11 months apart... because of this =)|`|AA10965418	I waited until I was 6 weeks.|`|GMrtEYj6aa	call your doctor and asked,i think its to soon,wait until you heal.|`|CIBtfxEqaa	I would definitely wait longer than 16 days. I know you are anxious to have some lovin' minus a baby bump, but give yourself time to heal first. You could get some kind of infection if you don't heal up first. I had a C-section and we waited 5 weeks and even after that, it was kind of weird. Almost like we barely seemed to touch. I would at least wait 4 weeks. You can wait! Besides, you will be so tired that sex will be the last thing on your mind.|`|4HFmQSrzaa	You really should wait until you've had a follow up check with the doctor. Even with a c-section, it can be damaging to your women parts (haha, classy, eh?) to have sex prior to. <br>  And if you're going to have sex before anyway...like someone else has said, BIRTH CONTROL. Unless you plan on another baby in 9 months. :)|`|AO4tzw6Vaa	i too had a cesearean bith but was in no hurry to have sex again too painful i know you want to be close with your husband again but they do say too wait at least 4-6 weeks and there is other ways u and your husband can be close again good luck your body will be back again real soon|`|A1vFSaDCaa	hi, i was advised 6 weeks after c section, because it takes that long for your body to recover to an extent. Too soon can cause damage, but speak to gp or health visitor before you do anything and they'll decide. better to be safe than sorry!|`|cI1JShJNaa	I had a c section and waited 6 weeks. My doctor advised me to wait because even though you can heal from the outside within two weeks the stitches on the inside can still tear. If they tear you are at great risk for an infection.|`|IwNJ3vhXaa	it depends on your body. it'll probably hurt you some but you can try. <br>  my husband and i tried and it hurt really bad so we waited a while longer. but good luck!|`|EZQIOIxxaa	I had a c section too I waited until I stopped bleeding which was 6 weeks. If you want to I say go for it. But if you're paranoid call your doc's office, usually a nurse can answer the questions for you.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	I would wait at least 4 weeks...you need to heal.<br>  <br>  I delivered vaginally and was told to wait 6 weeks, we waited 5. Everything was fine but it definitely hurt at first.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	I had sex two weeks after my first c section........three weeks after the second.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	I was advised to wait until after my 6 week post partum checkup. And I followed the doctor's orders.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I was super horny after my c-section. I have no idea why but yeah...weird lol<br>  <br>  So, we decided to have sex at 4 weeks post-partum despite my Dr's orders for waiting 6 weeks.<br>  I got really heavy lochia right after, which scared the hell out of me! Everything was ok, as it was just due to extra activity :)<br>  But next time i will learn to wait until my Dr says so. Its best to let your body heal a little.<br>  x

2PTlXs9zaa	My whole freaking body was like a potato with legs, growths coming out of different places, rashes, pains, gas, bloating.. shall I continue with what joy you will have for the next 4 months?|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Me!! Started around 20 weeks and has been on and off since then.  The cold weather seems to make it worse.  I bought a body pillow and make sure to keep it between my legs whenever I sleep.  Also use Icy Hot, it helps.|`|gdB8m4XSaa	You might want to pick yourself up a good heroin habit.|`|lLN8VD20aa	Wow ... I didn't think a babby could kick that low!
J4YNRrsuaa	ha! well there is no schedule...but since hes been 5 months hes been eating 2 jars of babyfood a day, and i'd say about 3-6oz of formula every 5 hours|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	My son is 7 months and I feed him on demand still.  IF he gets solids (which is rare) I try to do it early afternoon incase he has a reaction.  He only eats about .5-1 oz of solids.  Just remember that solid intake should not decrease formual intake.  My son is breastfed so I don't know how many ounces he gets of that.  Solids are for fun, not nutrition, at this age.|`|YuU4uXp9aa	Well my daughter isnt quit 6 months but I started her on solids about 3 weeks ago. I did one tbs. of rice cereal, very thick and 4 oz of formula for supper for the very first feeding. After 1 week I upped it to 2 tbs cereal, then at 2 weeks I added 1 babyspoon of applesauce with the cereal and the four oz of formula and then after a couple days went to 2 babyspoons of applesauce. She did that for a week and now is moved on to bananas. Just watch your baby and she will let you know when he/she is full. If they dont eat all the baby food/formula, then try a little bit less of the solids. If he/she still seems hungry then next time add a tbs more of the fruit/cereal. Here in about 3 days I am going to add vegetables at lunch and then fruit and cereal and milk at dinner. So just start off slow, and only one time a day. You can give the cereal in the morning if you prefer, but I like doing it at night. Best of luck!|`|GBpyHQBvaa	I have an 1 1months old and I've always fed her on demand. I give her the baby food before I do the formula. If she is full, she would disregard the formula.
HSUfe3m7aa	Most women have a 14 day luteal cycle (time between ovulation and your next period). So you would ovulate day 13 or 14 based on that. Watch for your cervical mucous to change to egg white consistency. It is best to BD every other day during your fertile period.|`|oHNrktxTaa	Everyone is different & because your cycle is average/normal you should be ovulating around day 14. I would think around that time prior I would TTC every other day for that week. <br>  <br>  Oh & the easiest OPK's is the Clear Blue Easy digital. It is either a O or a smiley face:) when it shows your LH surge. I am currently using it & it seems to def. be working. It doesn't get you pregnant, but gives you an idea to when you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK & BABY DUST!
BySnX7Gvaa	I will pray about her?????btw why are you adopting her|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I will pray for her also.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I have not read any of your prior posts i don't think.

Another thing that's sad is that a mother can't care for her own daughter. It's a good thing that you are adopting her. Good Luck and may Madelyn be okay.|`|yziXww8Kaa	I hope everything goes great.

Hope this helped and best wishes =)|`|YSRXarooaa	well you shouldn't just try to find something that sounds "cute" and ask strangers on the internet. Its not like shopping for clothes. You don't just ask people what a cute name for your daughter thats stupid. You are supposed to name her first name and middle name of something that actually has meaning to it. Like something in your life that you name her after. It has to be special. Not just sound cute. You are not naming a barbie doll.

311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	I would just stick to tylenol :)...|`|FLpMShKNaa	Motrin is an anti-inflammatory and lasts longer, but I have heard its only for 6 mos. + so I'd check with the doctor.<br>  Also, I agree that teeth can make babies miserable for some time, and orajel did nothing for my kid either. But if she has felt bad for 3 weeks, I'd have her checked out just to be safe. General crankiness/runny nose/trouble sleeping could also signal an ear infection. My son had a lot of ear infections before tubes, and he has lots of teeth-the symptoms can be similar.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	I would go with the Tylenol since acetaminophen is safer than ibuprofin...so I would go with the one that is safest for a little baby.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Motrin is better|`|QhTAQWiOaa	This is the early teething frustration.  I remember this, I have 4 kids.  as for the teething, we used to let ours chew on things.  The kiddie toothbrushes used to work great.  you have to watch them so they don't put it down their throat, but the kiddie toothbrushes are much shorter and wider than the avg. adult toothbrush.  it was clean and safe to chew.<br>  <br>  My kids did not like orajel either, but there is a stronger kids orajel too.  the little new born one does not work.  try the kids version and limit the amount.  (i also use to use Orajel to relieve the pain of diaper rash too.)<br>  <br>  As for the tylenol versus motrin, our doctor used to advise us to alternate the two.  Oddly, that was more effective than  just the one.  Motrin i think used to last 6-8 hours, versus tylenol's 4.  So Motrin was always the one before going to bed.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Motrin works really well when my Daughter is teething! You can try it! Just be sure you are giving her the correct dosage and make sure you write down when you give it to her so you don't give it to her too soon!<br>  <br>  ps- Yes, your Daughter can have Motrin! Its for babies 4 months and older! Heres the link!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.motrin.ca/eng/child/product/infant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.motrin.ca/eng/child/product/i...</a>|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	for fever- tylenol<br>  for teething pain- motrin<br>  <br>  also you should try teething pills! they worked like a charm on my son!<br>  <br>  <br>  you will need to consult your pediatrician on correct dosages though because it only will show the amount to give to children ages 2 and over.|`|Brqd1YcDaa	when babies are sick most always say give tylenol every 4 hours and motrin every 4 hours so they are getting a dose every 2 hours. but check with your dr.|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	Our doctor recommended Tylenol to us for a fever.  We have not used Motrin.  You should definitely ask your doctor.|`|AA10251806	ask your Dr but Motrin also is for inflammation that would help with the swelling of the gum's|`|L3oyAJq5aa	love the motrin!|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	When my niece and nephew are sick, we use Motrin.|`|Un4y3lWqaa	Motrin is for babies over six months.  Call your doctor.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I like motrin but with her being just 4 months make sure you talk to your doctor so you give her the right amount for her little body :)  Cause I think that 6 months is the age on the box for those dosages...but motrin seems to always do better for my son than tylenol...Good luck to ya!!<br>  <br>  and it's not about giving her motrin it is about giving her the right dosage for her age... <br>  <br>  Also you can put teething toys in the fridge to cool her gums my son loved that! :)|`|WlU3NFu6aa	dont give motrin until 6 months of age adn after checking with the dr. <br>  but motrin is stronger. <br>  sorry, your LO needs to just have tylenol
FkGh0LuWaa	The older show was so much better.  My kids don't like the new show at all.  They should of kept the structure of the show the same.  They really ruined it by changing it so much.  I put the older shows that I have on DVD on for my kids.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I agree. I hate the new show. Its a good thing I have a bunch on DVD. I liked Greg, I'm not a big fan of Sam. But Anthony on the other hand....mmMmmm
306cckyzaa	you should just wait and see if your period comes next month. i am pregnant and i asked some people they same question. they all said wait until you next period and give it a extra week to come just in case. there is really nothing to do but wait. the earlier you take it the less accruate its gonna be. <br>  <br>  so figure out when your next period is then give it a week after that and if your period hasnt come yet then take a test. pretty much all you can do is wait.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Based on your last period and assuming that you have a 28 day cycle you would have conceive on February 2.  So when you had sex on the 7th you were done ovulating, so you are more than likely not pregnant.
bS7DN85Qaa	Yeah, I was getting ready to get into the shower and I was standing up naked in front of my mirror (to check for skin cancer) with the door wide open. My mum came in and asked me what I was doing. MORTIFYING.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	lol no and if it did i would die of embarassment|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Yeah this morning actually. My dad was like Mercy(my name) are you in the shower? And i was like NO in the BATH and he was like ARE YOU IN THE SHOWER and i was like im in the BATH and he said OKAY when the water was RUNNING and he walks in and I am standing butt naked in front of the mirror brushing my hair out. And it isn't even my real dad so its not like he has "seen it all before" he is my step-dad which makes it worse! I'm sure your mom will be fine you too. Don't stress|`|MigBOiUPaa	lol no. i dont care if my sees me naked just cuz im comfertable with myself. just be happy it wasnt ur dad. why should u be embarresed??did she say anthing about it to u later on??? move on it happended its over hun.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|QGP930C6aa	i can honestly say nothing like that has ever happened to me :) good story though :))|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Awww that's not too bad.  A lot of people sleep naked - and I'm sure your mom knows that - so I doubt she's too freaked out about it.  But yeah, something like that happened to me once...<br>  <br>  My friend (a guy) was on his way to pick me up for a school thing.  I was running late - just got out of the shower - so I put a note on my front door saying, "Come on in, I'll be right down."  So I'm in my bathroom drying my hair, with just a towel around my waist... and I guess he thought it'd be funny to come upstairs and scare me (not knowing that I'm half naked)... and he reaches around the bathroom door to turn off the lights, but the door swings open and - voila - there I am totally topless!  Omg that was so embarrassing!  We just pretended it never happened and neither one of us ever mentioned it.|`|2iRkXJ4oaa	Well you came out of her Va---- naked so I don't think she cares too much. Don't be embarresed.<br>  <br>  My brother had friends over once and I had forgot a towel when I was in the bathroom. They were running around the house and then it got quiet so I thought I could make a mad dash to my room (across the hall) and of the course the hottest one was locked outside my brothers door and he like stared at me and then got let in. It was super embarresing.|`|X2eVfKc6aa	I would prefer for my father to not see me naked but i wouldn't be the end of the world if he did! he would probably just rush out of the room saying sorry or something, <br>  As for my sisters and mother i really don`t care, we all have the same things under are clothes, he he!|`|w6tQEuKCaa	yes..lol..i went to dallas to visit family and i was in the bathroom tryna put a tampon on and my aunty opened the door..and the bathroom had a wide az mirror so from the door all she had to do was look at it and see me on the other side..   :O wtf :p|`|NGMYrqeFaa	hehe, not like tht but ive got 2 bathrooms next to eachother , dnt no y, the shampoo was in one and i was in the other so i ran through named to get shampoo and my brothers m8 (quite fit) was at the door and saw me stark naked, embarassing?|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Yes OMG okay I was changing and dancing around BUT NAKED ( i got the body for it ;) Blasting lil wayne so my Brother comes in the room without even asking and says shut you're music off,and than he saw me naked!So embarrassing LOL.|`|a8tCObqraa	oh dear :( lol! i will give u a bit of advice use a dressing gowned when u need 2 go out the room then it will save any embarrassing situation and no its never happened 2 me.<br>  hope this helps good luck x|`|NJv2zKxnaa	Yeah.<br>  <br>  One time actually I walked in on my mom's friend..oh Jesus. It was so awkward.<br>  She's like 'It's okay...no problem."<br>  But I could tell she regrets locking the door.<br>  I walked in on my dad changing.<br>  My mom a few times.<br>  I have walked on 3 friends changing.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I'm that girl who always comes at the completely WRONG time.<br>  <br>  But actually one time I think if I remember clearly I was sitting on the toilet at a public restroom in a restaurant or something and the lock of course, I didn't realize didn't work when I sat down. I was gonna get up and switch stalls but I had to go the bathroom SUPER bad. So I just held it closed by my hand or maybe my foot. <br>  Anyway, a woman walks in casually into the bathroom, not like running like it was a dire emergency, but normally. I guess she didn't see my feet and WALKS IN ON ME. AHH! I was like Um... and she's like OH MY GOD!  I AM SO SORRY. I'm like 'SHUT IT!" and I shoved her out and said it was okay.<br>  <br>  Also that happened to me where I walked on the person using the public restroom.|`|m3rsLUgDaa	i was at my fiancees house during the day (when i was 16) and we had a nap (naked) anyway i really needed the loo and its the room next to his and his parents never come home during the day so my fiancee told me to quickly run and go, (note: i was young and dumb lol) anyway i come out of the bathroom and who should be standing there? his DAD, i just ran into my fiancees room and it was never spoken of again lol (his family aren't strict or anything) but so embarrassing.<br>  <br>  oh and another time when i was 17 i was round my fiancees house for xmas dinner (like every year) and we were sneaking in a quickie in his room before dinner was ready, half way through his mum bursts in to say dinner is done!!! she learnt to knock after that lol|`|3Pmq0rUMaa	Yeah!  one time i was in a dance place and the bathroom was for boys and girls...you know how there is only one toilet..well anyway! they lock was broken but i had to pee SO bad that i just went and this guy from my school opened the door as i was on the toilet...worst of all..i was TALKING to myself..lol im glad i moved...|`|5rO6l7GDaa	Yeh, I'm a bit dozy and sometimes had a nice long soak in the bath but forgot to take a towel = naked run back to my room!!|`|uTN69Vodaa	uhm...no...I sleep clothed...or in an over-sized shirt and underwear...<br>  but if I did sleep naked...I wouldn't leave my room without throwing some clothes on! Ever!|`|CqnoHNSkaa	I was staying with my Dad's cousin and family and we'd all been downstairs eating these pizzas and watching X Factor and it was something like 2am and I went up to the toilet (they have no lock) and my Dad's cousin was sat there on the loo. She was like "It doesn't matter pet!" but I was like oh my gosh.<br>  Another time my friend stayed round and my brother hid in the loo and she went in and pulled down her clothes to go on the loo and my brother saw everything!<br>  Ah when I stayed at a friends they had a sliding door for the bathroom and she kept sliding the door and then her brother walked in!<br>  I was at a friends and I was removing a sanitary pad and the dog managed to get in (again, no lock, What is it with no locks?) and I got him out. I finished and went back to play Singstar and next thing I know the dog had knocked the bin over and had got my pad and he took it to the top of the stairs and was eating it! Worst thing was my friends' mum was the one who noticed!<br>  So yeah a lot of things have happened to me!<br>  x|`|FK4h4buWaa	Once, I was taking a shower, and I was getting out, and I started drying myself off, and for some crazy reason, who else but my dad came walking into the bathroom! DAD! Dude!!! He simply said "I didn't hear the shower turn off!" He said sorry, and walked off...really fast. <br>  Another time, I was the one that walked in. I was at my step uncles house for a visit down in Iowa, and I had to go to the bathroom, and I didn't know he was in there shaving, and he was naked! Who shaves their face naked?! Well, apparently, my uncle. I saw everything, and it was horribly awkward the next few days I was there. :l<br>  edit: Oh, and I just remember a bit funnier one. I was going to the bathroom in a restaurant like TGIF, or OCB, and there was this mother with two kids, and the kids were very small, like toddler age. So one of them was a little boy, and he was curious I guess, becuase he went ON the floor, and slid himself underneath the door, and the conversations went like so;<br>  little boy- "HI!!!" <br>  me- ".......hi"<br>  little boy- "What are YOU doing here??!!"<br>  me- "......going to the bathroom"<br>  little boy- "Oh, that's cool."<br>  And we stared at each other, me pretty blankly, and him, just cheerful to be there. His mother yelled at him to come back soon after that. Hehe, kinda funny now that I remembered it.|`|p9GHfOloaa	once when we went on holiday my parents went out and i was by my self at the hotel and i was feeling really horny so i ask the maid to come in and sed the door will be unlocked. i pretended i was sleeping and was lieing on the bed naked with no blanket and since i had left the door unlocked anyone could come in and instead of the maid coming i it was my parents. That was really akward epecially as i started to scratch my private parts
XU1aTqQ8aa	$0.37|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Where are you having the shower? at your home or hers? or are you renting a place? <br>  <br>  Here's some cute, simple, cheep ideas that I have done. <br>  <br>  Get a clothes line or rope and string it up. Use the clothes that the mom already has for the baby or some that you have gotten. (I brought some at the senoir center at a bag sales for like 2 a bag) its a really cute way to show that your having a baby shower, plus the mommy gets to keep all the clothes, what's better then that. <br>  <br>  Make a cake its cheeper then buying one or having one made. Plus ou can make it with the moms favorite cake mix. <br>  <br>  Snacks are easy. Make some sandwhiches and cut them in fours. Stuff like tuna salas, egg salad, etc. bread is cheep (most churches give it away) also some veggie trays, Go to your local farm stand and get the veggies its cheeper and fresher.<br>  <br>  Punch instead of soda or bottled drinks. <br>  <br>  Get the paper plates at walmart or the dollar store. I would also buy the cups at these places. Plus the dollor store has some cute table decor, plus its only a dollar. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	If it is held in a home, it can be very reasonable. I would suggest a brunch, because breakfast foods are extremely inexpensive. Serve 2 egg casseroles or quiche dishes, fresh fruit, and muffins, pastry or bagels. Alternately serve lunch, but offer either chicken salad or a deli tray withcroissantss and a big salad. Does not have to cost alot. <br>  <br>  If you really want it to be inexpensive, just serve punch and cake, but then you should make certain the shower is like from 2-4 or 3-4:30, so the time does not imply a meal. I would try to make the punch look especially nice, since there is no meal, etc. I would also have water and iced tea in pitchers for those who may be calorie counting.  If youdon'tt do any decorations, it may not feel like much of a shower. Why not let your gift act as the decorations, ie: buy onesies and clothespins and put them around on a clothes line. It will look cute and serve as your present to her, if money is the concern.  Another inexpensive idea, is to get her ultrasound picture and upload it to Walgreens or costco.com. Use the baby announcements as an invitation, but rather then announcing anything, write in the info for the shower instead. At Walgreens 20 of them will cost u just under $10 and they are super cute. It will look like you went the extra mile. Just some tips. It is super sweet of you to throw a shower for your friend.|`|xwZKouCIaa	well order a couple  piza pies pick up a cake at a grocery store buy some chips and soda should run you about 80 bucks and thats if u keep it very simple make your own invitations on the comp. .ect ect go to ur local dollar store you'd be amazed on what you could find to decorate with|`|YtSGbYqEaa	you can spend as much as you want to it all depends on what u want|`|TLjNUJHLaa	It depends on if the person throwing it is cheap or not.|`|GBpyHQBvaa	It depends on how much you want to spend per person. Think about the decorations, the food, the favors, the place where the shower will be held at etc... and see what you can afford and where you can cut cost.
KN2nwZk3aa	Open ended activities are a three year olds best friend.... build blocks with him, talk about the shapes colors and sizes. let him create and tell you all about it, sing songs while you do it... Give him paper crayons and let him create and talk talk talk. Shaving cream or whip cream on a cookie sheet making letters shapes designs, read read read books and let him talk about each page , go slow enjoy the pics. Give him rides on a blanket, a magic carpet.  Children learn best when they can explore and experience. make a drum from a coffee can and paper. make an indian vest from a garbage bag. use aluminum foil to make a astronaut costume.. Most importantis the journey not the end products. I have 20 years experience with young children and was director of a preschool...  Smile and be engaged with the child ... you will teach him far more then just a number, color or letter... He will learn that he is valued!<br>   have fun!|`|USPvOd7Kaa	My Dh just taught our daughter (2 and a half) the game I spy and she LOVES it.  It reinforces colors.  Singing songs, esp songs with hand moves like Itsy bitsy spider, always goes over well, if you are enthused when you do it.  Just reading is good too, you can ask them about what is happening in the story  or just about the pictures.  Anything to do with the alphabet is good too.  Hope I helped!
OCTvfDsxaa	It's normal for the ultrasound to look disproportionated to you. Don't worry-your baby will have a normal figure.|`|YI31TqNNaa	totally normal =] right now their head is the biggest part of their body. so dont worry =] the baby will eventually grow into its head, and by the time they are born, they head makes up only 1/4 of the total body size|`|tP8r06ZHaa	yes perfectly normal.<br>  the brain is developing and growing at this gestation.<br>  don't worry anymore|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Babies heads are bigger in proportion to the rest of their body so yes it looks and will be big but it's not "huge" and we do grow into them.|`|VHgfWPS2aa	Yes its normal , They grow into there head ..
ce9d609b58380ee151ad9021694da085aa	First of all... Congratulations on your expectancy.  Having a baby is a wonderful, joyous, scary and exhilarating experience.  You are doing the right thing now by asking questions and learning.  Just remember, you will never know EVERYTHING and are not expected to abd ou will make mistakes and you will learn from them... no one is perfect.  <br>  <br>  I breast fed both of my girls.. many moons ago.  I feel breast feeding is the BEST and ONLY way to feed your newborn and baby.  I understand there are exceptions to this rule.  Going into it educated makes it an easier decision.<br>  <br>  I stopped nursing when my girls were a year old and they went straight to a cup.  It was the hardest thing to do.  But it was time.  (My sister went almost two years)  <br>  <br>  It really is the easist thing.  Your milk is always "Just the right temperature".  When it's time to feed, it's the most amazing time ever an when you stop, you will miss it.  You never have to pack or prepare before going out... the kitchen is already onboard.<br>  <br>  And as for pulling up a shirt.  Never had that problem.  Once they have whole food introduced, they adjust nicely.  Nursing slows down as they get older and usually is saved for mornings and night... which helps them and you relax.<br>  <br>  And there are many benefits to breast feeding!  It contracts your uterus and helps slim down quicker.  It releases wonderful "Feel good" endorphins that make you happy.  It burns way more calories!  And it's a great way to bond with your child.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|AA11903503	1. yes, i breastfeed and I love it<br>  2. I don't plan to stop until he is 12m, or he self-weens (we'll see what happens)<br>  3. I have know 6&7 month old babies who will lift moms shirt to be feed, so NO just cause they can lift your shirt or know where their food source is does not mean you should stop.|`|iPEv1lRBaa	1.  Yes.<br>  2.  My son is almost 9 months and I'm in the process of weaning.  <br>  3.  I hope not, but weaning is harder on the baby than I thought it would be.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	I breast feed and I'm planning on doing so for as long as I can. <br>  <br>  My cut off is 1 year though, don't wanna be that crazy British lady breastfeeding an 8 year old lol!|`|o5piRiBsaa	1) Yes (son is 3 months)<br>  2) One year old<br>  3) No.  Right now he does grab my breast when feeding and will try and pull it into his mouth, which is actually really cute.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Yes I do.<br>  I haven't decided. As long as possible.<br>  I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I breast feed, but we are currently weaning.  My baby is 10 months old.  We are weaning because I work full time, and can't pump enough to keep my supply going.  My baby has never tried to grab at me.  She usually just buries her head into my chest when she's hungry, which just looks like she's hugging me.  I wouldn't have breastfed her past a year, though, even if I could have.|`|pOsnTnimaa	i wish i researched breastfeeding before baby came along.<br>   yes i am exclusively breastfeeding my 5 month old baby girl<br>  im actually not really sure how long we will continue, maybe ill let her breast feed as long as she wants as long as its not past 2 years,<br>  <br>  breastmilk is really the best possible thing that u can give ur baby, go for it<br>  breastfeeding is a very special bond between you and your baby and no one else can have this bond with ur baby, <br>  good luck|`|DcLiW4bbaa	I breastfeed my 2 month old, and I plan on stopping once she gets teeth. Once she can bite it...yeah, game over, lol.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind if you do decide to breastfeed that it will be more difficult than just using formula but I think it's totally worth it if you can persevere and stick with it. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision. :)|`|deIzFnV8aa	1 - yes, and am glad I made the decision to<br>  2 - planning on going at least a year and perhaps a bit after. I would like to transition directly to cows milk w/o using formula in between.  We will see what happens, though.<br>  3 - haven't really thought about it|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I have breastfed all three of my children.  My oldest weaned at 14 1/2 months (when I was 6 months pregnant with baby #2).  My middle child weaned at 2 1/2 years (when I was 6 months pregnant with baby #3).  My youngest is still nursing at 18 months with no end in sight.  I assume he'll continue to nurse until at least age 2, and I imagine we'll be done by age 3, but I'll just take things one day at a time, and we'll see what happens.<br>  <br>  What I like best about breastfeeding is that it's easy (once you get past the sharp learning curve of the early weeks), it's convenient, and there's no washing/preparing/buying bottles/formula.  I didn't even have to get out of bed to nurse at night.  My husband would bring the baby to me the first time they woke, and we'd just nurse lying down in bed.  Sometimes I'd put baby back in the crib; other times, we'd just fall asleep together.<br>  <br>  The thing about nursing is that most babies aren't really holding the breast like they do a bottle.  They do learn to latch really well after the first couple months, though, so they can even do it in the dark at night.  And all babies have different ways of asking to nurse -- some bury or bang their heads against mom's chest, others pat her chest, other tug at her shirt.<br>  <br>  My 18-month-old can start to pull my shirt up when he wants to nurse, but he still needs me to get him into position and move my bra.  It's not like he's walking up to me, stripping me down, and latching on all by himself.  ;-)<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant with my first, my goal was to nurse for 6 months.  Once we hit 6 months, things were going so well that it didn't make sense to even consider formula.  She was still nursing 5-8 times per day on her first birthday, but she weaned fairly quickly (probably b/c I had no milk left due to the pregnancy).<br>  <br>  I never imagined that I would nurse a child past age 2, but with my 2nd daughter, I just took things one day at a time, and there we were.  She didn't eat many solids, and she really did need to nurse for both comfort and nutrition.  Again, it didn't make sense to wean her sooner.  When I started to wean her right after her 2nd birthday, it was nice and gradual.  After just a couple months, she was only nursing 1-2 times per day, and I could have done that for a while.  It was easy on me and still offered her that connection/nutrition that she needed.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd start out breastfeeding with a goal of at least 8 weeks.  Those first 6 weeks are really the hardest, and if you don't give it your all and get through them, you won't get to experience how easy it is after that.  Then, just take things one day at a time and see how you feel.  You might be surprised at how easy it is to just keep doing what you're doing, especially when it works so well for you and your child.
8t8NjjnVaa	I wouldn't just ignore it.  That is just letting him get away with it.  Ignoring bad behavior DOES NOT make it go away.  <br>  <br>  If he hits someone, grab his hands, bring him right up to your face and tell him NO in your meanest-mommy-voice.  Then use his hand to lightly stroke your face and say "make nice" or "be nice"or something like that.  <br>  <br>  If he hits again, put him in his crib or some other suitable area for one minute.  Then go get him and tell him "We don't hit" and show him again how to touch lightly.<br>  <br>  He will get the picture pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  I must say I'm pretty appalled at the answers to ignore it.  Yes, he's only one, but he needs to know that hitting is not okay and it hurts others.  Ignoring it when he hits someone is basically telling him it's okay and giving him a free pass to do it as much as he wants to.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	i would say to try and ignore the behaviour because this way he isnt getting any attention from you and if you give him lots of praise when hes being god and ignore him when hes being bad he will soon learn the only way to get ur attention is to do the good things.|`|auNUWQo7aa	He doing this for the attention. Don't show him any. Pretend like you didn't even know he hit you and he will eventually get over it.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	If you won't spank him, then you'll just spoil him. Sorry to say, but if your kid's hitting other people, he needs to be spanked (Even if it's gently) so that he knows how it feels. He doesn't understand that it hurts people when he does that. YOU are the mama... Enforce some rules. Don't let your one year old child run you over. That's a good way to lose control forever. Studies show that if you don't gain your child's respect BEFORE age TWO, you will spend the rest of your life negotiating with them (or saying, "no no, sweetie... That's not ok...") Believe me, I was more afraid of a spanking than I was of a "no no" when I was little. My mother had NINE children (All from the same mom and dad) and when we needed to be spanked, she spanked us. I can pretty much count on one hand the amount of spankings I ever got because they were well deserved. And she would spank us if we hit other people. That's not acceptable behavior from anyone, no matter what age. Take control, mama!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	The best thing to do, whenever possible, is to catch his hand *before* he hits you and show him how to "touch nice" and tell him to "touch nice".  When he does touch nice you might want to make a big deal out of it, and completely ignore him when he hits you.|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	My son used to do that, he'd also grab peoples faces.  He thought it was funny when we told him no.<br>  <br>  Finally, when he wasn't trying to slap or grab,  I started showing him what I meant by "gentle" I would take his hand and have him gently stroke my cheek, and than I would stroke his cheek and say "gentle" he thought this was a fun game.  Than when he would hit or grab my face, he knew what I meant and would try to be "gentle".  It took my husband and I about a week of doing this every single time, but it's been 4 days since he slapped or grabbed my face.<br>  <br>  He's 9 months old.|`|cv0foxlTaa	What has worked for me is to very firmly say "don't hit Mommy, it hurts" and put him down right away.  <br>  <br>  Also, try to teach him what "gentle" is by taking his hand and stroking it on your face very softly.  When he hits you can try saying "No hitting.  Gentle, gentle".<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vJEatJFPaa	LOL<br>  <br>  Olivia is 9 months and purposesly kicks me when Im changing her diaper...She usually watches my face the whole time. I don't show her any emotion and evenually she gets a clue. Its tough because they really don't know what they are doing.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My 17 month old has been doing this lately. He will hit me and say ouch because he wants me to say ouch. I find that either walking away from him or ignoring him works. He's just looking for a reaction and when I don't give it to him he moves on.
jsdDgIuRaa	So you support your daughter but not yourself?  I am confused??? <br>  <br>  Maybe your dad should claim both of you if he is supporting both of you.<br>  <br>  Do you work and support yourself?  If so he shouldn't be claiming you I think, you have to file your own return and claim your child...but best to ask a tax person.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you work and support yourself and your daughter than no, he cannot claim you and can get in some serious trouble.  You have to file a tax return for your income and will have to claim your daughter, if IRS notices they could audit and he will get in trouble.<br>  <br>  Here are the rules for claiming a dependent:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc354.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc354.html</a>|`|AA12282580	If I were you I would file your own taxes and claim the baby.  I mean you have the paperwork your job sent you right? Just pretend you didnt know he claimed you.|`|EeGgovyCaa	No you are a dependent|`|oUtEVKDHaa	no because you were claimed as a dependant by someone else. you can't support someone when someone else is supporting you. why did your dad do that? did you let him? do you work?<br>  <br>  well he can amend his taxes but is it really worth it? i mean if you say something you might get him in trouble. what you can do is tell him to buy you a used car or something because you are entitled to the money he took from you. he ruined your chances of claming a credit you qualified for. he should've done that. i don't know if he can amend though. i think he can you should tell him so you can make things right before april|`|u94HOVz7aa	if you provide the majority of your income for living off of your dad had no right to claim you and you can file with the irs making him amend his taxes without you as a dependant then you can claim you and your baby.  if you are over 18 he cant claim you without your permission adn signiture if  i am remembering right (similar thing happened to my hubby when he was 18)

uLdeIhHqaa	To ease your mind- My entire pregnancy I hardly ever felt my Daughter move. She never was really active and it was all because the whole time she was in my tummy she was Frank Breech (Feet beside her head) So, I was at the Dr seemed like every week wondering why my Baby wasn't moving! Its because she stayed in that position the entire pregnancy! Dont worry! If your baby has a strong, healthy heartbeat they are fine!|`|pCZPtegeaa	That may just be it. It's your first baby, so the tiniest movements, you probably won't feel because you don't know what to look for.<br>  <br>  21 weeks is still a normal, common time to feel that first kick!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|nah8tOF6aa	its normal you'll feel the baby when the baby moves|`|t44168wJaa	well the lining in your uterus is still pretty thick don't worry you will be able to feel the baby at some point and they kick hard sometimes good luck
8t8NjjnVaa	To get a definite result, they'd need the DNA from the mother as well.  They 'can' test with just the father's DNA, but the accuracy is not as good then.<br>  <br>  If a father needs to have one done, he can request a court order for a test to be done and the mother would have no choice but to let the baby be tested.<br>  <br>  However, in all likelihood, the suspected father would be the one to have to cough up the few hundred dollars for the test.<br>  <br>  Or you could just go on the Maury show and have him pay for it LOL.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I am no expert but I think that they will need the mothers DNA too. If she does not consent I believe they will have to get a warrant for her DNA.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	i think so..|`|OThwE3Whaa	You are correct; they will need a sample of  his DNA, your DNA, and the child's.  They will use a cheek swab to obtain epithelial cells.  Make sure that you use a court approved lab; if you just pick someone off the internet, the court may not accept the results.  I am currently in the middle of a paternity suit, and my lawyer says the cost of a court approved DNA test is about $400, which my ex will have to pay.  My lawyer said that the only time the mother is expected to pay some or all of the test is if the test proves the alleged father is NOT the biological father.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I think so because usually they ask for your DNA as it is easier to compare if they have your profile along with the potential father's.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	No they don't need your DNA for a paternity test. They just need the potential father(s) and the baby's. They do need your consent though to do the test being you are the child's legal guardian.|`|yjNbFfqtaa	If he wants to establish only paternal association, the mother doesn't need to be present. Of course that will make analysis little more complicated but there are always a set of genomic regions called microsatellite DNA which act as biological markers and can establish, with reasonable certainty, that a child is fathered by him or not.<br>  <br>  You may also wish to consult these notes on DNA Paternity Testing: <a href="http://www.testcountry.org/dna-paternity-testing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.testcountry.org/dna-paternity...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps. <br>  <br>  Kind Regards,<br>  Tarun Gupta<br>  National Centre for Human Genome Studies and Research<br>  <a href="http://hotbacteria.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://hotbacteria.wordpress.com</a>|`|7d3adc8b8ddb50801b26f5c95af67ee8aa	I believe so...

8WbfmK5daa	I would say between 28-32 weeks the further gone you are the clearer the pics.<br>  <br>  But if you wanted the best week in my opinion it would be week 28. That is when I had a 4D scan of my little girl and it was AMAZING.<br>  <br>  And so much better and clearer than 1 of my friends who had hers at 24 weeks when she was pregnant.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I get 2 D ultrasounds every 2 to 3 weeks due to being high risk.  And my doctor always does a little 3D at the end just for fun.  My best 3D scans were at 27 weeks.  The one at 24 weeks was pretty good.  But the one at 27 weeks was great.  The one at 30 weeks was really good to.  But the one at 32 weeks was not at all.<br>  <br>  Just my experience- have fun|`|2LO5UXUTaa	I have an appt for the 28th. I had and appt 2 weeks ago but when I went they advised me to reschedule because they may not be able to see anything clearly seeing as how I wasn't far along, they told me to go in between 28 and 32 because over 32 weeks the baby looks squished.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	28 to 30 weeks.<br>  <br>  I got mine at 25 weeks, but they have more fat on them at 28 to 30.|`|AA11916244	They say 27-29 week area because thats when the babys face is filled out to "maximum cuteness" Oh and be sure to call now if you want one because these places book up quick. Im 28 weeks and they cant get me in til 32.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	I think they told me between 28-30 wks. Speak to your dr about it. They can tell you when it's best.|`|a98nJlnEaa	the place i went to told me that babys features are done at 26-28 weeks so i went at 27 weeks and 6 days and i must say... baby looks like me... :-) you can call the 3D/4D place and ask them|`|FRzf9tGZaa	now! They say you say you are in the optimal range to see the babies face.
gv8lt6jEaa	you don't say how ticklish your kids are or how old they are. but I dont see whats so bad about tickling a kid, no matter how ticklish they are or how long you tickle them for.<br>  If they start crying because of how ticklish they are you can just keep tickling until the laughter returns|`|aOCfLAJJaa	You only tickle them if they tickle first. <br>  <br>  BTW, don't do it too much, it can actually kill if done too much.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	I don't see how she thinks that will cause them to distrust adults.  Thats a bit odd.  The only thing I would say is that if they are asking you to stop, then you should.  I know that when someone tickles me or makes me laugh to long I don't like the pain that I get in my stomach, and when someone is tickling you so you can't stop that pain, then it is unbearable.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	As long as you stop when they say stop there is no problem. It's when the tickling continues even when the kid is begging for relief (it becomes almost like torture) that's when the child might feel violated and like they have no control over what an adult does to them.|`|BRT2teSqaa	You are.  I have no idea what your sister is talking about.  How will they fear adults?  You need to ask her for an explanation because I am curious haha.|`|lQaeb2wNaa	As long as you stop tickling your kids when they ask you to, you are doing nothing wrong.|`|AA10475412	Nothing wrong with tickling.  Once in a while people tickle my feet, and I still enjoy it at age 36|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You may not like this, but put yourself in the position of a child who is being tickled against their will by someone 5 or 6 times their size - it is like you being tickled by a 600 lb man!<br>  <br>  Tell me, would you like it?<br>  <br>  If you don't want to stop doing it, make a deal with the child and ask them if they want to be tickled - if they say "No" then don't do it.<br>  <br>  Some experts consider tickling children abusive, so that is something to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  Try making them laugh some other way, reading funny stories, telling jokes, but skip the tickling, it isn't funny when you are on the receiving end of it.|`|TrBoPj92aa	your right, unless you are always doing it, its fine for the children to have fun with the parents and the children,<br>  <br>  when my daughter was about 7 every night when my fiance got home from work she would rush up to his bedroom where he would be getting changed ( taking his tie off) and she would jump up to him and they would have about 30 minutes of "tickle time" she still does it occasionally but i know my fiance misses it and he can't wait until the twins are old enough! he is such a big kid!!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i did not like being tickled too much as a child and i won't allow it with my own children (other than a little poke to the side or something) but anything longer than a couple seconds is too much.  a child (or adult) for that matter might be laughing when tickled, but it is a reflex and the tickler is kind of sadistic.|`|Yy6GIHCuaa	Well, it's a great thing. She just may be a bit of a hypochondriac... haha jk :]<br>  ALTHOUGH. there is a point to stop. they might actually start crying, not from laughing, but from being pissed off. you'll probably learn how to push their buttons, but if you have a girl.... really know when to back off, especially when she's older. i mean, we can be pretty mean and moody, like when were on our period. yeah, good luck with it all though!|`|4iXL4C6paa	I think a little bit of tickling is fine and fun but I also hated being tickled when I was a child but as long as your children are smiling, laughing and coming back for more keep on tickling lol|`|z0ro3VkJaa	The appropriate amount is to whatever point the child stops enjoying it.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	you are right.<br>  I don't get how tickling will make a child fear or distrust adults...|`|NQcHRUbfaa	As long as your kids are having fun and are not showing signs of distress,tickle until they tell you they've had enough. My son will usually tell me when he's through with tickling.  Most of the time he says, "Tickle me some more. Again! Again!"  I think you are right.  Spend as much time with your kids as you can!!!!|`|yayDgY0qaa	you. your sister is crazy. no offense.
H5i8BMh2aa	Wow.<br>  This is so weird I'm 16 and I had my baby on feb. 13th and gave her up for adoption.<br>  I was feeling fine until today, I totally broke down and cried the hardest I think I ever have in my whole life.<br>  I was just thinking "I don't feel like I can talk to my mom, and I don't want to talk to a councilor, and my boyfriend works so much I just wish I had another girl to talk to in the same situation"<br>  <br>  my email address is yoshidust@yahoo.com.<br>  feel free to email me anytime.<br>  I don't know if I can help you or not, but I will try.<br>  If you have a myspace or facebook we can talk on that too.<br>  <br>  There is an adoption section on Yahoo answers, maybe you should ask this question there.<br>  The people there might have some help for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: After reading the other answers people gave you, seriously go ask this same question in the adoption section.<br>  People here don't know how to help you. You can't just easily go read a book or hang out with friends when your feeling like this.<br>  Its really hard to distract yourself.<br>  <br>  The people in the adoption section will have much better things to say. (hopefully)<br>  And if you ask there I will read the answers to see if anything would help me too.|`|acj9mB9Paa	Aw, poor you!!  Keep this in mind though.  I am SO glad my bio mom gave my sisters and I up because she would have never been able to care for us properly!  She did what was best and let us live (instead of aborting us).  I didn't get to talk to her until I was 27, but I am glad I did!  Just think of how grateful your baby will be to you!!!  You were the best mama you could be by giver her a chance for a better life!|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Call Boys Town these people are awesome when I was younger I used to call them all the time. 1-800-448-3000. They helped me get thourgh all the werid stuff that was going on. There not strinks there just there to help 24/7|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Prayer, truely it works.|`|tz1aVHoUaa	awww blesssh, well you need to keep yourself occupied find a new hobby or something, i don't want to lecture you into any hasty decisions but the first thing i would do is get my baby back no matter what because it's like a life bond between mother and child. but to help you with missing her you could always go to your best friend and talk to he when you need comforting, i can't promise you all friends are trustworthy but most of them are. wish you the best of luck.........<br>  XxxMwahXxx|`|FfeKzUycaa	Don't listen to some of the silly comments on here.   Take care of yourself.  You're at a very sensitive point right now.  Just understand that what you did is probably the best you could've done for your child.  I'm sure the adoptive parents will allow you to have a relationship with your child if you choose to.  Sorry.|`|o7bQfI9Faa	I think if you are lonely if you have the money buy a pet . They always make me feel good so I think you feel good too.|`|3USNsjlTaa	Stop hating shrinks and see one.|`|AA10373677	you should read a book and take some time to learn about your self lifes to short to be sad|`|GB3MVI1Maa	aww well, you could see the babys father more, if you feel happy when your with him. and try to go out with your friends and dont sit around the house on your own, because that will make you feel a lot lonlier. see the babies father more. call him more just to talk to him. and when you are back to school just be with your friends and your boyfriend and just enjoy your life. Maybe talk to a teacher or connextions adviser (a person young people can tlk to) if you have them at your school. i know we do. When you talk to someone about this, about how u are feeling u will feel a lot better. And it will be better when you get back to school and are with your friends again. xxx<br>  xxx<br>  xxx<br>  xxx<br>  xxx<br>  Hope i helped you in any way. <br>  xxx|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	* Edited...<br>  <br>  What a terrible ordeal for you. I really do think you need to see your baby. Seeing her, holding her and talking to her - generally seeing she is safe and happy, will help you and be just terrific for her too.<br>  <br>  I think you can handle it because you need to handle it; it's part and parcel of becoming a mommy - whether you've given the baby up for adoption or not, you're still a mom and the feelings you're experiencing are strong, and may not go away as quickly or easily as you had hoped. I think you were very smart in arranging an open adoption.<br>  <br>  The decision you made was right for you at the time you made it, and now you can make the decision to still be in your daughter's life - just in a different sort of role.<br>  <br>  All of that said, until you see your daughter, I don't know if you could call this just hormonal. Passing a baby along to another would be the worst, most painful thing that most women could ever experience, and I think what you're going through is normal. No drugs or hobbies are going to help if you need to see your baby; so, take care of that need because you are an important person and your needs are as important as the baby's.<br>  <br>  You have an open adoption, take full advantage of it. The reason for open adoption is because it is usually healthier for mommy and for baby.<br>  <br>  If you see the baby and these feelings remain or become stronger, 15 or not, you might not be alright with the situation as it is now. If you find that having the baby adopted is something that you cannot tolerate emotionally, then perhaps you could talk to your family about alternatives to changing the arrangement. Be honest now, and ask for help and support. Again, while you made the right choice at the time, things do change, and you may have time and the support to change them now that your little angel is here.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, sweetie, and I hope you see your daughter soon and that you feel better too!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I think giving up your baby was probably the best thing you could have done.  You have made a family very happy no doubt, and it will allow you to finish your schooling and live your childhood.  <br>  You were very selfless to give her up.  Every time you feel sad, you can think about how happy you have made 2 people who were probably aching to have a baby to love and care for...and you can also feel good knowing your baby is likely being well taken care of.<br>  <br>  What you also can do is go talk to your regular doctor.  You can be suffering with PPD(Postpartum Depression) possibly, and he can help you with medication if needed or getting you someone to talk to.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Are you allowed to go see your daughter or is that not an option?
uLeXGHnKaa	It is possible for a woman to give a yeast infection to a man, and then once she gets rid of it he can transmit it back to here, even without knowing he has one! I would treat him or at least have him go to the doctor to see if he has one too, otherwise you guys will just keep passing it back and forth.<br>  <br>  I tend to get them alot too, my doctor told me to make sure I eat yogurt with active cultures in it every day, because that helps keep the yeast levels down. Also, you can try putting plain yogurt with active cultures on a tampon and leave it in overnight. Baths also usually help me.|`|cYmIMtGOaa	yea i think its ur husband just treat him and u once more and ull be over with it|`|v3LnJycKaa	it is most likely not your husband, your PH and bacteria levels go nuts in there when you are pregnant, it is also most likely NOT re-occuring, and more likely never going away all together, I have found a yogurt in the morning and afternoon helps (one with live cultures) looser fitting pants, breathable undies (cotton) etc... also talk to your dr they have a pill you can take that helps to head the infections off at the pass.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Yes, men can contract a yeast infection if they have unprotected sexual activity with a partner who has a yeast infection. If both partners are not treated, they can keep re-infecting each other. Male sexual partners may develop genital irritation and genital itching, especially if they are uncircumcised, but usually there is no discharge.<br>  <br>  But it could also be just that you are pregnant. Pregnancy disturbs the balance of your vagina. There are many causes of them. You need to try to find out if it is something specific that is causing them. But you could just be one of those women that get them bc you are pregnant. <br>  Here is a website that can help you figure out the causes and ways to prevent them..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/general_health/wh_yeast.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/He...</a>|`|AA10458750	That was happening to me and it was him that was passing it back to me. Alot of peopel don't realize men can become carriers of the yeast, just like women, but without all the symptoms. The problem is, Drs. recommend an oral medication for men's yeast infections and that medication isn't safe for you during pregnancy. I'm not sure if he took it and waited 7 days if it would be okay or not, you'd have to talk to your Dr. The medicine is called Diflican. What I would recommend is maybe having him wear condoms to prevent the re-infection this time after you treat yourself.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My daughter has a birh defect that causes loads of infections (including yeast) when she gets ayeast infection, she became basically immune from medications after awhile, so the DR told us to go to the drug store and pick up something called Lanolin over the counter. It is an athlete's foot cream, but as the dr said, fungus is fungus. It works and we use it every time now.<br>  <br>  Call your DR and ask about it, it has some active ingrediant or something that is really good for yeast infections. Let me look it up so maybe you can google it, hold on a minute so i can go get the tube...<br>  <br>  Ah, it's called Lamisole, sorry about that!!!!|`|cEFbc57Xaa	I suggest you and your husband begin taking a homeopathic remedey that you can buy at your local health food store. It is called Acidophilus & Bifidus. It helps tremendously. In the interm you can continue to use a topical anti-fungal cream (canesten or monistat). Also eat lots of yogurt. Avoid the really sugary kinds as they will only contribute to the infection as will all other sugar-rich foods.|`|NRfqivKPaa	Im sorry thats no fun. idk what to do. good luck~
CrmCHVI0aa	in my experience, nothing worked. from sex to red leaf tea to extremly hot currys. even had the sweep. babies come when ready and not before. was fun trying it all though|`|MW1yrHbOaa	from experience, the baby will come when it is ready, Castro oil, walking, doing squats are all myths. I was induced and it still did not start my labor or make me dilate more.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sex, walking, nipple stimulation ... some say castor oil but I wouldn't just because you can make yourself even more miserable with diarrhea. <br>  <br>  But nothing will work if the baby's not ready to come out. Depending on how far along she is, it might not even be safe to try. (like some who want to induce themselves at 37 weeks because they're miserable).|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Home remedies will not make you go into labour unless you are ready, so they're useless.<br>  <br>  Raspberry leaf tea is a uterine tonic, it will not induce labour, it will only encourage your uterus to contract effectively during labour, and therefore supposedly gives you an easier labour.<br>  <br>  You would have to eat an enormous amount of pineapple for that to even have an effect on your cervix.  Same goes for the prostaglandins in sperm.<br>  <br>  I drank RLT, it never induced my labour, and I didn't use it for that.  I did feel it encourage me to contract better when in labour though.  I used evening primrose oil, this helped my cervix to be "favourable" but again, it does NOT induce.<br>  <br>  Nothing short of medical intervention will induce labour, and even that is high risk, and means you have to be on continuous monitoring.  I'd recommend your friend have a little patience and wait til her baby and her body is ready.|`|7kosr9mcaa	BOUNCE FAIRLY HARD ON AN EXERCIZE BALL! <br>  <br>  I swear thats what did it for me. I could feel that my baby was sitting low and when I bounced on the ball I bounced hard enough to be able to feel a bit of pressure from the baby hitting my cervix. I did this for 5 hours straight! The next morning I was in labour and had a beautiful healthy baby boy the next morning after that!|`|U12kQCD4aa	Drinking raspberry herbal tea worked wonders for me and friends or else you could try spicy foods but the maybe will come when he/she's ready so tell her make the most of silence and get ready to give a whole lot of extra love,<br>  Wishing her all the luck|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Waiting until the baby comes out naturally, because it's clearly not ready.<br>  <br>  Don't be so impatient.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I tried absolutely everything! I tried sex, I tried using the breast pump, I tried walking around, (and running up and down the stairs repeatedly!) The thing I did that I think worked not everyone can do. We have wood heat. so I decided to go haul and stack wood. I did that for a good 2 hours, and went into labor about 4 hours after I finished. I don't really recommend this...my doctor yelled at me for it when my husband (big mouth) told him! <br>  I wouldn't try the castor oil because it is toxic! look up castor beans. It can't be good for you OR the baby...|`|AuVtUjVAaa	She can try walking, nipple stimulation, sex, spicy foods. Form my experience nothing worked, except when I got my membranes stripped at the doctors office. 2nd time it worked, went into labour the next day..although nothing should be tried before 37 weeks|`|gEyCvH1kaa	i did evrything.. walked alot, eat spicy foods, sex.. but i still had no signs of labor at all.. no braxton hicks, no mucous show, barely dilated to 1cm at 39+ weeks.. but right on my due date i was in labor.. <br>  <br>  i did have sex the night before my due date but i dont kno if that had anythign to do with it haha but baby will come when its ready|`|758cDKEFaa	i tired everything in my pregnancy books and nothing seems to work!<br>  so i thought id try my own way to bring it on :)<br>  i did non stop squatting and had a few short breaks in between yeah in was tiring but i was in labour within a day!!!|`|AA10034285	It is definitely not a good idea to try to interfere with Nature's natural processes. The baby will come when it is good and ready. Your friend would be well advised to leave it at that.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Here are some ways: nipple stimulation, sex, walking around endlessly, and eggplant Parmesan.  I didn't do these personally, but have friends that swear by the eggplant parmesan and sex.  Have fun! ;)|`|TZ4mbFh3aa	Well I tried it all, and ended up getting induced.  Just let nature takes its course...Good Luck|`|32d545c3cbe280c7e18b34b572efbb4aaa	My mate put his Mrs. on the back of a trike (3 wheel motorbike) and went down a bumpy track.Worked a treat !|`|FDpalItSaa	Once she gets to her due date and over get her to ask her consultant for a membrane sweep.  Although they will only perform this if the cervix is "ripe".  My due date was the Tuesday, I had a membrane sweep on the Thursday and went into labour on the Friday!!  Some people find membrane sweeps painful but I did not find it painful or uncomfortable.  Just before my date, I tried all the other things people have already suggested.|`|RQgM6mrIaa	In my experience nothing worked but i would tell your friend to just wait until little one wants to come i no how miserable times can get towards the end 3 times over but its good not to rush things along as your friend will realise when little one is born let things happen naturally its the best things. A baby is precious and worth waiting for. Oh please tell your friend not to try castor oil altho it is very good for clearing you out and giving room down below it can give you very severe stomach cramps and horrible diarrhoea which is awful. Good luck with your friend!|`|paJwBTB2aa	sex,rasberry tea,nipple stimulation,bouncing on a exercise ball,walking .arcpuncture,castor oil , spicys foods eating pineapple ,reflexology even dancing such as moving our hips and standing. <br>  <br>  If that doesnt workand our a week overdue i'd ask our midwife for an induction good luck x|`|cFsPNXkiaa	this isn't me i heard this loads of times<br>  <br>  Sex<br>  Curry <br>  herbal tea<br>  Ingesting sperm or pineapple (they both have the same hormone or something) <br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|7EW2r5OUaa	the day my daughter was born, i ate lots of pineapple,went long walks, had lots of sex.im sure that helped!1

LHomWyYQaa	Well you made the mistake of being original.  I think the name you have chosen being Dev is very masculine and that those around you should mind there own business.  My two sons have both got original names and my wife and I did this as we both have very boring names that when someone calls us in a public place 10 other people turn around as they have the same names as well.  <br>  <br>  When our boys are called out at school assembly for something or other everyone knows just who it is as they are the only ones with those names.  Many people most likely did not like our choices either but we really did not want a kid named david or michael.  Jake was also very popular around then.  The answer to come back with is 'why would you give a kid a name that everyone else has'  and as long as you didn't name your son powderpuff then why should they care.<br>  <br>  Just tell them that while they are entitled to their opinion they should perhaps keep it to themselves.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Well, Dev isn't that bad...But you could have at least finished writing Devin or something...<br>  <br>  People care because some people name their children horrible, horrible names. And people cling to the idea that "your baby, you can name them whatever"<br>  <br>  Well I'm sorry, you can't name them whatever. That is not your baby, that is a person. That is a person who is going to have to live their entire life with whatever name you pull out of your ***. <br>  <br>  Again, Dev isn't as bad as some, but there are a lot of people who just hate (HATE) to see children wind up with pathetic excuses for names.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Some people just want to get into other people's business. Don't let it bother you. Just say, "What would you name him?" I love doing that, because the name they come up with is usually odder than the usual one.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	I guess you can just ignore them...<br>  <br>  Dev is interesting i admit.|`|iZk9jEBpaa	I love the name you picked out for your son, as long as you like it then don't let anyone tell you otherwise. There's no way he will get teased because his name is lovely. <br>  <br>  Congratulations by the way (:|`|SpYS7VYoaa	Tell them that its a unique name and that one day your son might make history with that name and not some generic name, so everyone will remeber him much better then if his name was Michael or William or something!|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Ignore them. Your baby, your name choice. It's not that bad! They're just jealous that you have a beautiful baby boy ... and they don't.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|bS7DN85Qaa	It's because they're ignorant and they don't care about other people's feelings.|`|meAr7GIYaa	Just ignore them. Mine baby is Madelyn Noelle and I get a lot of comments on hers. Some people just love to concern themselves with other people's business. Just don't let it bother you, I'm sure your son is adorable. :)|`|tlEMsiHwaa	1 dev is a guys name and you should of toled them off because its your son not theres, you should of toled them what name you would called him. and if there gonna say that there not much of a friend.|`|I64JOuMKaa	dev is a coool name for a boy !<br>  ignore your friends<br>  they're just jealous that you have a beautiful baby boy and they've got nada.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	The name is not outrageous like some celebrity names.

oHNrktxTaa	O honey, I know how frustrating this may all be. I am ttc my first & hate being let down. But, you really should either take a HPT or call your OBGYN & make an appointment for a blood test. It will give you back your sanity. If it is not this month, it will happen for you. I believe it has to do with the right timing & everything happens for a reason.<br>  <br>  I will say a prayer for you. Keep me posted:)<br>  <br>  Sending you TONS of Baby Dust!|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	wow i can understand the let down month after month. been there myself. but just think the longer u wait the longer your not seen by the dr and something could be wrong with the baby. please take a test or go see your dr. its best for u and your unborn baby. gl and baby dust my prayers r with u.
os36Q3P2aa	Hiya <br>  <br>  My son was like this,he was a c section baby  and had a lot of mucus the doctor said.To me it sounded like wheezing but his actual chest was clear   and  the noise was coming from his throat ..bottom line he sounded awful but his oxygen levels were perfect and his chest was clear .<br>  I was forever taking him to the doc's too.<br>  My doctor  said this could last up to 6months of age ..thankfully it didnt !<br>  When my son sounded 'bunged'' up i got some vic's vapour rub put  a blob of it in  a bowl of boiling water and left it on the window ledge AWAY from his cot   so the room smelt of vic's which helps...<br>  I also put a blanket rolled up UNDER the cot matress/moses basket so it was slightly tilted  so he was laying flat on his back.<br>  Its a massive worry the same as all mums..he was my 4th baby  yet i was and still am forever checking him !!!Just a mum thing i guess <br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS !!!! and good luck <br>  <br>  <br>  xxxx|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	I have never heard that baby congestion is normal. My children never had this. Have they done blood work, chest Xray, etc?|`|y9CgveCGaa	I would just say listen to your doctor.  And watch his chest and stomach.  If they are rising and falling, he's getting enough air.  Our daughters seemed like they were congested a lot.  I can't remember the details.  I think the humidifier is a great idea.  We did that too.
63c89ddaa8e877f3bd14961332d1cda8aa	I got mine at 8wks boy was I glad thought I might have been pregnant again also. Never wanted my period to come so bad LOL|`|eDfh1yhYaa	Every woman is different... mine came back after six weeks and slipped straight back into my normal monthly cycle. Perhaps taking a pregnancy test now just to make sure might be a good idea, i conceived my second baby just 12 weeks after delivering my first, a lovely surprise, but no one told me you can be super fertile after giving birth!! Otherwise a chat with your doctor might also help.|`|0XhKJ3ifaa	Your body is still going back to normal. its nothing to worry about just yet with my first i didn't get my first period for 6 months! and i knew i wasn't pregnant coz i hadn't had sex! Oh yeah i exclusively bottle fed all 4 of my kids! I hope i eased your mind a bit.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	I got mine at 5 weeks...my friend who had a baby 3 days before me  got hers at 4 weeks. My cousin got hers at 5 weeks. Just giving a few examples so you know a range. But everybody is different.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I got mine at almost 12 weeks.
Coc593Ikaa	Well, they can't fire you for being pregnant, but they do not have to hold your job while you are on unpaid leave unless you qualify for FMLA. So if you have to take time beyond what you have saved up for sick/vacation time then they can release you. It is legal for them to do so.<br>  <br>  The question is what kind of people do you work for? Just because they can let you go doesn't mean that they will. This depends a lot on how indispensible you are. If you are in a professional job, you are much less likely to lose your job over this than if you are in a job that can be filled by anyone. Also, can business go on without you for that time frame?<br>  <br>  You'll just have to tell them an find out how they react. Good luck.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	I am in the same predicament.  I am now 12 weeks pregnant and have started working at my job for 3 weeks now.  Some of my friends say that I should tell HR as soon as possible and others have told not too because it can back fire on me.  I plan to tell them after my probation is over that is in April and by that time I will be 6 months.  I too want to do the right thing but fear that they will find the smallest excuse to dismiss me.  Is your company unionized.  When does your probation ends?.  I would wait until after probation and I would make sure that I get to work on time and do the best job as possible.  I wish you the best.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	They may come up with some BS for firing you. Go to your state'shealth care website to see if there is anything you can look into. I didn't qualify for health coverage yet from my job because I had only been there a few months, so in Colorado I qualified for a partial coverage, which is better then what I would have gotten at work.|`|VHgfWPS2aa	I live in Canada and they can not fire us here for any medical and after 3 months somewhere your in the union and they can not fire you at all , I 'm not sure about your situation but I don't see how they can let you go ,Can you get away without telling them for a bit?|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I doubt they can fire you just for being pregnant.  Is your job one that you can safely perform while pregnant?  You may or may not have an issue when it comes time for your leave.  You will have to take off for a few weeks, and since you don't have FMLA, you'll have to work it out with them.  My bosses were really nice about it and let me come back when I had my daughter.  I am pregnant again now and have been told I can come back again.  I still don't have FMLA because I'm part-time.  The point is, there's no guarantee your job will still be there for you at the end of your leave.  Hopefully your employer will be kind enough not to put you through that.  It also wastes their time and money because to hire and train a new person is usually a lot more trouble than waiting 6-8 weeks for a good employee to come back.|`|mKUMsE5jaa	You shouldnt get fired for telling them your pregnant.  If your a good worker they will most likely be more than happy to have you back after you have the baby and want you to work there as long as you can before the baby arrives.  If they fire you they have issues.  They should be very happy and excited for you!!  Your having a baby!  Congrats! <br>  <br>   26 weeks pregnant with my baby boy! Soon to be mom.|`|cn91FeWcaa	dont tell them u are pregnant until they ask or you start showing ....|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	Well they can not fire you...you are allowed to have off.<br>  <br>  Actual paid "maternity leave" — while the norm in every other developed country — is unusual in the United States, although some enlightened companies do offer new parents paid time off, up to six weeks in some cases.<br>  <br>  Most likely, you'll use a combination of short-term disability (STD), sick leave, vacation, personal days, and unpaid family leave during your time away from work.<br>  <br>  You are only 9 weeks you don't have to tell your boss right away that you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Short-term disability is meant to cover your salary — or a portion of it — during the time that you're unable to do your job due to illness, injury, or childbirth. Many large employers and unions offer it, as do several states. (It's generally provided automatically to all employees or residents, not as an optional benefit you have to sign up for.) Look into this because only few states provide is, I know that New York, New Jersey and Cali. are some, I forget the others.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Where do you live? Because as far as I know,in the US,they can't fire you for being pregnant. But they may find loop holes for not giving you maternity leave. You'd have to speak to HR.
uFrqC4Y2aa	At 5 months they jus tneed to know. They should be told as soon as possible.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	do you're parents know about it ? <br>  if they do take them with you to her house & let them tell her parents.if they don't know,just you & you're gf need to tell them together.don't let her face them by her self.<br>  good luck.|`|AA10622097	All high schools in our district have a Pregnant Minors program. Speak to a school counselor at once, ask for help and tell them you have not told your parents. You both need help, and soon.|`|JZnRxPUCaa	Well, it is very important that you tell her parents! She needs to be seeing a doctor for her prenatal care!!!<br>  But a great way to break the news is to just sit down with them like mature adults and tell them.  Of course they will probably be in shock- but its not like they are going to hurt either one of you.<br>  If your g/f is taking care of her prenatal care, then once you have an ultrasound, give them a picture... you do not have to say anything at that point.<br>  Just know it is very important for her parents to know so that little miracle inside of her is being taken care of.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Please just tell them - she needs to have prenatal care. There are no "tips" or advice to give... you just need to say it.|`|6L9jJnchaa	She needs to see a doctor!!!  You are risking the baby's health the longer you wait!|`|gClDDlgjaa	First of all did they see the baby bump because if they did they know shes pregnant and they just want you guys to come clean either way you are going to have to come clean and just be like hello um we have some news for you that may be surprising were are going to have a baby and shes already 5 months and we would really like it if you would support us at least 70% and if they get mad just stay come the lord will be there for you and just go to church a lot that always helps people.|`|hTE8C8praa	I was 16 and 6 months pregnant before I had the courage to tell me mom, well, I didn't tell her, it just became obvious and she asked. You have to tell them, I mean, they will find out, lol. Just sit them down and tell them. It won't be easy, I've been there, but you must do it. If you are still young, you need to make sure she is seeing a doctor to make sure the baby is healthy. Just sit them down and say it, they might get mad, but they will come around, they won't stay mad forever.|`|C1blHL9vaa	I agree with the above posts that you just have to tell them and that there is no easy way about it. I do not agree with the implication that your girlfriend has been irresponsible and not seen a doctor. My mother did not find out I was pregnant until I was 6M ( at age 17) but I had been seeing a doctor under her insurance without her knowledge. How do you know what this young lady is or is not doing? She will start showing however so you guys need to bite the bullet and tell your parents. It won't be easy and you should be there too.|`|bTlhBX3daa	If your girlfriend has not been receiving pre-natal care, which is likely considering she is probably covered by her parents insurance, you two are being completely irresponsible and not looking out for the health of this baby. She needs to see a Dr. right away, and you both need to own up and be honest with her parents. <br>  You made adult decisions, now grow up and deal with the consequences.|`|imIiuaAAaa	First of all, you both are immature for waiting this long to even think of telling anyone -- this is a LIFE we're talking about, not a bad grade on your report card. There really is no "easy" way to do it...you're both young and they're probably going to be disappointed, but it needs to be done so she can get proper care for your child. Try talking to your parents first, and see if you all can tell her parents together.<br>  <br>  Good luck with telling them and the pregnancy.|`|z0RxunSfaa	They will find out right away, but at this point, she needs to stop worrying about what her parents think, and worry about how to take care of the baby, if that is her choice. There will be no easy way of telling them but that is one of the responsibilities she now has to deal with. Adult responsibilities are always difficult, but well worth the effort|`|SihmWU0Baa	im 6 months pregnant and im 16<br>  <br>  <br>  they easiest way to tell her parents is to sit them down at dinner in a public place so they cant overlly react and they are gunna find out any ways <br>  <br>  cuz of doctor appts.  and shes gunna start popping out and haveing more signs...<br>  <br>  so id tell them asap to make sure you have the best care for your child they might take it better then you think mine did...and i have 2.5 months left|`|AA11604128	There really is no easy way to tell them. It's better to do it now than to wait. They might even know already or at least suspect. She really needs to see a doctor to make sure everything is ok. You could make it easier by telling your parents together.

It's not a great ideal.  It's trying to get rid of Wast and adding sex could make your flow harder and cramps worse.  My doc told me this.  I know you have a chance not sure what it is.  WebMd may tell you.  You could even call a what at they called shoot.  Prevention place.  ummm....  One of them places you go to when your planing to have a baby or need the plain B pill.  They might know for sure.<br>  <br>  OH yeah.  Once your discarge get's to a sticky way you have released a egg.  That's when to be warned.  If you are not takeing birth pill's or have a plan every day start to take your temp.  When it raises you have released an egg and should stay way from sex the week before and from then on.  <br>  <br>  I'm was a teen mom to one and only 21 one my other one was born.

I can easily undo the straps on mine with one hand and transfer the baby to the sling.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Unfortunately, most infant carrier car seats require two hands to be able to pull it out of the base or to change the position of the handle.  I've seen handles that can be released using only one hand, but never a base.  He may want to discuss this with his wife's doctor.  S/he may be able to suggest a car seat that would work for him.  I really just don't think there is one out there that can release from the base using only one hand though.<br>  <br>  *Thanks to your brother-in-law for serving and sacrificing for our country.  Thanks to your sister as well.  I fully understand all that a military wife goes through.|`|OjHFN4imaa	I haven't seen one yet that only uses one hand, but an idea is to skip the infant car seat and go straight to the convertible rear facing seat. Most of those can be done up or undone with one hand. That may be his best bet. Good Luck!
8kaDm2D8aa	mine sleeps from 9pm-8am, wakes twice for a bottle and takes a nap around 11am for 2hours and 3 for 1hr.  all babies are different|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Yes if the babies tired it will sleep, an active baby will sleep longer.|`|N1IQuM1jaa	my 5 month old sleeps a similar amount of time, and i was worried she was not getting enough sleep, as health visitor kept talking about 2hour day-time naps!  She is happy and healthy, so i have decided that she must be getting all she needs.  she sleeps from 8.45 until 7.30, and might sleep for 30mins during the day, but it can be a battle to get her down for that.  <br>  <br>  sometimes i will take her out for a walk for an hour just so she gets a little more sleep.  i am also trying to put her down as soon as i think she is getting a bit crankie...but generally day-time sleeping is hard work! mind you, i took her swimming for the first time today, and she slept for 2 hours afterwards!!!!!!<br>  <br>  if you baby is happy and healthy, and doesnt get too grumpy, i guess he is getting all he needs...unfortunately that just means you probably arent getting what you need!  everyone used to tell me to sleep when baby sleeps during the day...more often than not, that is never for me!|`|Dx2ayijwaa	Wow, I'm a bit jealous! My son still doesn't sleep through the night. The naps are a bit short, but that can be fixed. You said he is an active baby. Try to think of activities that will further wear him out.

9P26sacKaa	You should interview other doctors and midwives if you don't like yours for whatever reason.  If you need someone who will be more personable and will give you time and attention, you should consider hiring a midwife for your prenatal care and birth.  After all, low-risk women who hire midwives have better outcomes and less intervention, in general, than low-risk women who hire OBs or family practice doctors.  <br>  <br>  It's actually not uncommon for some doctors to make you wait such long times, but I wouldn't put up with it.  I don't like feeling like my time is so worthless to them.  It's not necessary for them to measure you at every appointment, but I'd expect a few more minutes of time or to be seen by a nurse or something if all they were going to do is what your doctor did.  Why pay such a high price for care that isn't all that great and doesn't give you much anyway.  She should have at least mentioned your pap.  Usually they only CALL if there is something wrong, but they will tell you the results at your next meeting regardless of the outcome.  <br>  <br>  I switched providers at about 7 months because I really didn't like the practice I was working with.  I switched to a midwife who took my insurance, worked with one of the best doctors in the city, and who would actually meet me at the hospital and stay with me throughout labor.  This is pretty rare, even for many midwives, but doctors NEVER do this.  A doctor usually shows up 20 minutes or so before you push out the baby and charges you lots of money for consulting with your nurses over the phone.  I wanted to know who was going to be with me.  Maybe you can find a midwife who is like this?<br>  <br>  Good luck!  It's almost never too late to switch providers, especially if you don't like the one you're with.  After all, this is your birth, you're only going to do this a few times in your life.  You might as well make the best of it by making sure you have a good provider.|`|fHgbL046aa	If your not comfortable then you should switch doctor's. Leaving you for 45 minutes that is crazy. You should feel comfortable and relaxed with your doctor. I had a doctor with my first and she was okay, but made me wait 18 extra days to induce me, then I got stuck with a student doctor who was awful. This time I'm going with a midwife and a different hospital. I would rather have a doctor that listens to me and tells me everything I need to know. Surprised she became an O/B  and have no personality.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	If you really feel that negatively towards her you should switch if you can.  This is the woman that will likely help deliver your baby...do you really want her there if you hate her??  I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|60FCA8dVaa	You don't need that much done at this stage. If you don't like her switch. I did in the 8th month to a midwife that would do a home birth. It was a good idea.|`|mWZE7gF7aa	I am switching now actually.  I am not comfortable with my doctor, and I am 28 weeks.  If you are not comfortable, change.  There is no reason this needs to be an unpleasant experience for you.  IMHO.  =o)|`|NMzlbWt8aa	IM switching mine as well because Im 21 wks, have yet to have my pap done or have any other exams other than my blood pressure and a few questions.  So change if you want, or try to ask more questions of your doc|`|T43Ha0OSaa	Keep in mind, this is your body and you can direct who you will having poking and prodding it.  With most doctors, no news is good news, but I still understand why you are a bit frustrated.  <br>  <br>  I was 30 weeks and changed my doctor because he had no bedside manner and seemed to disregard my concerns with two word answers.  I DID NOT like him and I got a referral to another doctor who I love!<br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable, by all means change because you are going to want someone you feel comfortable with, and plus, its your money and you can pay who you want.  Go ahead and change now.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea i would switch, im switiching mine because im not told about any of the results from my ultrasounds, blood tests, nothing. she talks to fast and wont let me get a word in edge wise.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Actually what she did is normal.  They dont start measuring until the third trimester (some may do it a little early, some a little later).  All your visits with almost all doctors will be the same.  They do your weight check, urine sample, blood pressure check, listen to heartbeat, ask if your in pain, and thats it.  It will be that way until your almost due.  If she didn't tell you any of the results of your pap and you didn't get a phone call or anything in the mail, then that means everything is fine.  It's if they say anything or call you about your results is when things may not be fine.  If you have a question then ask.  Your doctor will not guess what you want to know, you have to flat out ask.  If you dont ask they assume you know or are not interested so they wont say anything.  Do not be afraid to talk to your doctor. <br>  <br>  Your ultrasound may say 20 weeks, but you still need to go by what dates your doctor gave you.  It is expected for due dates to be off up to two weeks in either direction since nobody knows the moment you ovulated and concieved.  Ultrasound dating is very inaccurate after the first trimester.  Babies start to grow at different rates and you will continue to measure different (even when they measure your belly).  Something as simple as position of baby can cause measurment to be off.  You may measure two weeks ahead right now, but next time you may measure a week behind.  It is all very normal.  <br>  <br>  But if you really do not feel comfortable with your doctor then start looking for another one you will feel comfortable with.

VFIF4zpAaa	If i had a daughter that got pregnant at 15 i would of course be mad 4 awhile. But, then i'd want to sit down and discuss this with her. make her think about the mistake she made.<br>  If i got pregnant at 15 i would freaking out. your 15 nobody is ready for a kid at the age of 15. i would go straight to my mom and tell her. I would tell her exactly this i made a mistake and don't know what to do. I honestly think i would keep the baby because i don't believe in abortion. But it's different with everybody. This is your Choice you should really decide on your own what you should tell your parents.<br>  <br>  ~Jesus is Love~<br>  <br>  p.s. Hope this helped a bit|`|47iY7d5Laa	It really depends on the person, but if I had a fifteen year old daughter and she told me she was pregnant, I would have to support her on the way.<br>  <br>  Of course, I would be very angry and shocked at first, but it would be a very scary thing in her position, and she has learned her lesson. Being angry at her for long would just make matters worse.<br>  <br>  If she decided to keep it, I would help her take care of it, but she has to get it through her head that she is the mother, And I would not look after it all the time.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	15 is young I am 18 (19 in April) My parents handled it better than I thought they would when my bf of 4 years and I told them (now were engaged  That was the plan pre baby though)  Adoption is a good thing if you are up to it. Since my parents are the way they are we are keeping the baby and they are having us live with them and pay a small rent.We are attending school and working. <br>  When I found out I was pregnant I wanted to wait till I couldn't hide it(ya right) I fould out a 8 weeks and they were told almost 3 days later. <br>  In all of this especially since you would be 15 and still in school and not graduated yet you could put it up for adoption or keep it. Abortion is a tough thing to talk about but I would not suggest it, it is not good on your body and could damage your body and you may not be able to have kids in the future. <br>  Just talk it over and remain calm. GL|`|KEoChTcdaa	I broke that curse. <br>  <br>  My mother, grandmother, and great grandmother all got pregnant between ages 15-17. It sucks, yeah. But usually means a few things. <br>  A) The parents aren't active enough in the child's life.<br>  B) The child is irresponsible due to inactive parents and looking for attention elsewhere. *hint hint*<br>  C) The child was never taught how to make smart decisions.<br>  <br>  It's sad, but true. If My daughter got pregnant I would take half the blame. It would mean I wasn't paying enough attention to her to see that she needed love and would find it elsewhere. <br>  <br>  And If I got pregnant at fifteen with the history in my family and the amount of attention my parents paid to what I did each day? I would probably be dead...lol. Or... would've gotten kicked out. My dad would've been furious.|`|zmpk29BLaa	I would be furious with her, make her get a job and watch the baby herself, then at 18 she'd be out. She should know better than to do that. That sounds cold, but honestly I would hope that I'd raise my daughter better than to have unprotected sex when she's 15.. my mom has always told me that if I got pregnant I'd be on my own, so you bet I was careful. I'd expect the same of my own children.<br>  <br>  I didn't have sex when I was 15 years old so that would've never happened to me. I'm an adult now, so if I got pregnant I would just tell my mom I was pregnant.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Support her. I know it's a shock, but she would need you. I had my first baby at 17. My mum could tell before i did!|`|2fpKELiUaa	I'm fifteen, and I'm pregnant, and I told my parents.|`|bmoCpcdraa	my children don't run the streets so, no problem,i hope i helped|`|Qas05nZraa	I would be unhappy|`|4ZQxAvE2aa	I think it depends on if she was mature. Obviously if she got pregnant at fifteen, shes not that mature and responsible. However it depends on the family situation also. If I was able to help my daughter financially I think that the baby would be kept. If she didn't want to keep the baby I think the best solution would be adoption.|`|seU9VwIJaa	I would have her consider adoption. Abortion wouldn't be an option at all. I would be shocked and probably feel like a failure for a while, but I can assure you, my children will be informed about sex ed! If an accident happens, I'd just hope that she would be ok with talking to me about it. Accidents happen...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't have been pregnant at 15, but I would have gone with the open adoption route.|`|kw80YHMLaa	Probably shout at her and ground her first of all but at the end of the day i'm her mother and she would need me but i'd hope to say i'd support her emotionally and financially to a point, as i know for a fact my mother would have if i was in the position but then again 15 is so young to be sexually active.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i would help my daughter take care of her and i would try to embrace the situation. <br>  after she has the baby i would be sure to put her on mirena!<br>  <br>  if i were pregnant at age 15...oh gosh, that'd be very hard. i don't know for sure what i would do.
8zdPI8Qsaa	I got induced with my son at 39 weeks exactly (preeclampsia), and was about 70% effaced, but hadn't dilated at all beforehand. They started me on Pitocin for about 8 hours, and I only made 1cm of progress, so overnight they stopped it and gave me the Cervadil. 12 hours later I was still only dilated 1cm, so they started Pitocin back up, broke my water and I went to 3cm in less than an hour. I then got the epidural and went from 3cm-10cm in 20 minutes! Apparently me being more relaxed was all my little boy needed to make his way through :-) I ended up only having to push 4-5x before he came out. <br>  So, from beginning to end was 22 hours, and though contractions were hard the whole time, I didn't start making much progress until my water broke & the epidural was the clincher. The Cervadil doesn't hurt at all if that's the route they go, and it comes out easily (like a tampon). I'm guessing since you're already somewhat dilated & effaced that they might just go the Pitocin route, but I'm no doctor! Good luck!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I was induced at 42 weeks.  <br>  <br>  They didn't tell me what induction I was going to have until I arrived and my doctor examined me.  They choose induction methods on  many different factors. <br>  They may do something as simple as just starting with some cervadil and see if that kick starts labor.  <br>  <br>  I went in and was 4 cm.  They started by breaking my water and starting pitocin.  I was very sensitive to potocin so they had a hard time regulating it.  I either had back to back contractions or hardly any at all.  I was tensing up bad and my labor stalled so I was encouraged to get an epidural so I could relax, I did, and after that I was fully ddilatedabout an hour later.  I pushed for 4 hours and my son was hung up on my pelvis and wasn't ddescending  He heart rate began to drop because of the stress and he passed meconium so I had to have a -section.  He was born in perfect shape despite the scare.  <br>  I really believe that the induction didn't had anything to do with me needing a c-section.  It is a fact that with induction, their is a higher rate of c-section, but I think I would have needed one anyway.  I have a very narrow pelvis and my son was too big and his head was too big to pass through with the position he was in.  They were going to attempt some turning ttechniquesbut when he passed meconium and his heart rate became uirregularthey didn't want to mess around and we did the c-section.  <br>  <br>  I have had a few friends who did great with induction.  One of my friends had her baby 2 hours after starting induction and she only pushed 4 times.  Lucky b*tch.....lol.   <br>  <br>  Don't stress, you'll be just fine!   :)|`|MqFeJiukaa	I have had to be induced twice.  With my first I was given Cervidel because I wasn't dilated at all.  With my 2nd induction I was not given any thing since I was already dilated 1cm.  If your cervix is favorable they will just start pitocin in your iv.  With my inductions they didn't break my water until several hrs later when the pitocin was not causing contractions.  Best of Luck to you!|`|8UujqaV0aa	for me i had a bad experice with induction. i was first given the cervical gel twice and that didnt work to get me dialted and then the next day i was hooked up to pitocin and let me tell you the contractions come on HARD. i was 2cm dialted and 30% effaced when i was given the cervical gel. i was also 41 weeks pregnant, and once i was hooked up to pitocin i was in labour for 36 hours, he was stubborn and big (9lb,11.8oz). my sister too was induced but with pills and her experience was better, after she had the pills she went for 3cm to 10 in four hours. so best of luck to you.|`|a1x0xqARaa	Well, due to my husband's (now divorced) lack of wanting to get out of bed, I was forced to wait out much of my labor pains throughout the night.  Finally at 6 AM, I got up and packed and ORDERED him to get up because I was having this baby today!!  lol  By the time I got to the hospital, I was dilated to 9 and 100% effaced....ready to go, just about!!  So they admitted me right away and two hours later and 10 minutes of pushing, I had my son.  I was only having my contractions throughout the night.  My water never broke, they had to break it for me.  All they did was stick this long stick like thing with a point on the tip up inside and broke my water.  Didn't hurt at all.  Just felt like I wet myself!  lol  But afterwords, the pressure came and then the hard contractions.  And I was on my way to having the baby.  I wasn't even able to get any medication because by the time it got in my system, I would have already had the baby.  And they were right!!  (That was my first baby.)<br>  And they never gave me a suppository.<br>  Good luck!!|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	With baby 2 I was induced. It was great!<br>  <br>  Your a 3! so when you go in they will break your water and start iv fluids. Let nature take it's course. Getting your water broke does not hurt. They check you like normal and while they check you make a tiny tear/hole in the bag. <br>  <br>  After that they will give your body time to work if it dont they will starrt IV medication to help bring on extra contractions. <br>  <br>  I have never heard of them giving a suppository to start labor. yOU CAN ALWAYS SAY NO. <br>  <br>  Search online on how you want your birth story to happen and do it that way let them know. <br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  for me i was a 3 they broke my water and started iv fluids and medicine my choice for the medicine right away. had a baby by 12. I went in around 6-7 not bad at all
NBHQMyosaa	It doesn't sound like you are even old enough to be responsible for having sex.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	take a test|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Maybe, unfortunately no one can tell you yes or no.

E6T9DPT9aa	Personally, I think that there is no particular age to start having sex at. Just when you are in a long term relationship, and you have the common sense to use a condom, and you are with someone you trust 100%, THEN have sex. Also, when YOU are ready to, not when your partner is.<br>  <br>  I was 14 when I lost my virginity. Had been with my boyfriend for 2 years (he was 2 years older than me.) He had already lost his virginity, but he waited for me - and never dared pressure me into anything. We are now getting married on 25/06/09. We had talked a lot about it. No pregnancy scares ever - thanks to condoms and the pill.

It will cause you much less emotional heartbreak. THink how bad you would feel if you had sex with a guy, gave him ALL that you could give him, and it didn't mean anything to him and he dumped you for anybody else. I know it's not cool, but waiting till you're married is the right thing to do. Sex is not just for fun...it is a commitment that you love each other and nobody else (in my mind). So I think it should only come after marriage.

If you don't have a history of preterm labor or miscarriage, you should be able to nurse throughout your pregnancy just fine. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe-to-continue-breastfeeding-while-pregnant_8935.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe...</a><br>  <br>  And you can still nurse them both once the baby is born.

However you can expect that most doctors and nurses are unaware that it is safe, never mind the lovely comments you will get from family, friends, and strangers.<br>  <br>  Because your baby is less than a year old you need to pay close attention to make sure that they are getting enough milk.  Pregnancy doesn't usually reduce breastmilk production, but the hormones prevent as much milk from being "stored" in the breast which makes the initial letdown less and can be frustrating for babies.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/01safety.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/0...</a><br>  Yes, in most cases. At this time no medical study has been done on the safety of breastfeeding during pregnancy so it is impossible to list any definitive contraindications. If you are having a complicated pregnancy, such as lost weight, bleeding, or signs of preterm labor, you should problem-solve your individual situation with your caregiver. Depending on your individual situation and feelings you may decide that continued breastfeeding, reduced breastfeeding, or weaning is for the best.<br>  <br>  You do NOT need extra calcium.  You do NOT need extra iron.<br>  ----------<br>  American Academy of Family Physicians<br>  <a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/policy/policies/b/breastfeedingpositionpaper.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/polic...</a><br>  As recommended by the WHO, breastfeeding should ideally continue beyond infancy, but this is not the cultural norm in the United States and requires ongoing support and encouragement.69 It has been estimated that a natural weaning age for humans is between two and seven years.70 Family physicians should be knowledgeable regarding the ongoing benefits to the child of extended breastfeeding, including continued immune protection,71 better social adjustment,72 and having a sustainable food source in times of emergency. The longer women breastfeed, the greater the decrease in their risk of breast cancer.73 Mothers who have immigrated from cultures in which breastfeeding beyond infancy is routine should be encouraged to continue this tradition. There is no evidence that extended breastfeeding is harmful to mother or child. Breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy is not unusual. If the pregnancy is normal and the mother is healthy, breastfeeding during pregnancy is the woman's personal decision. If the child is younger than two years, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned. Breastfeeding the nursing child after delivery of the next child (tandem nursing) may help provide a smooth transition psychologically for the older child.19<br>  <br>  --------------<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/articles/bfpregnancy_safety.html#uterus" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/artic...</a><br>  The specter of breastfeeding-induced preterm labor appears to spring in large part from an incomplete understanding of the interactions between nipple stimulation, oxytocin, and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The first little-known fact is that during pregnancy less oxytocin is released in response to nipple stimulation than when a woman is not pregnant.5<br>  <br>  But the key to understanding breastfeeding during pregnancy is the uterus itself. Contrary to popular belief, the uterus is not at the beck and call of oxytocin during the 38 weeks of the “preterm” period. Even a high dose of synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) is unlikely to trigger labor until a woman is at term.6<br>  <br>  Instead, the uterus must actively prepare in order for labor to commence. You could say that there are two separate states of being for the uterus: the quiescent baby-holder and the active baby-birther. These states make all the difference to how the uterus responds to oxytocin, and so, one can surmise, to breastfeeding. While the baby is growing, the uterus is geared to have a muffled response to oxytocin; at term, the body’s preparations for labor transform the uterus in ways that make it respond intensely to oxytocin.<br>  <br>  Many discussions of breastfeeding during pregnancy mention “oxytocin receptor sites,” the uterine cells that detect the presence of oxytocin and cause a contraction. These cells are sparse up until 38 weeks, increasing gradually after that time, and increasing 300-fold after labor has begun.6,7 The relative scarcity of oxytocin receptor sites is one of the main lines of defense for keeping the uterus quiescent throughout the entire preterm period—but it is not the only one.<br>  <br>  A closer look at the molecular biology of the pregnant uterus reveals yet more lines of defense. In order for oxytocin receptor sites to respond strongly to oxytocin they need the help of special agents called “gap junction proteins”. The absence of these proteins renders the uterus “down-regulated,” relatively insensitive to oxytocin even when the oxytocin receptor site density is high. And natural oxytocin-blockers, most notably progesterone, stand between oxytocin and its receptor site throughout pregnancy. 8,9,10<br>  <br>  With the oxytocin receptor sites (1) sparse, (2) down-regulated, and (3) blocked by progesterone and other anti-oxytocin agents, oxytocin alone cannot trigger labor. The uterus is in baby-holding mode, well protected from untimely labor.4<br>  <br>  --------<br>  Calcium<br>  <br>  Pregnant and/or nursing mothers do not need additional calcium other than that normally required for their age group. The Institute of Medicine recommends that nursing mothers over the age of 18 consume 1,000 mg. of calcium daily -- the same as other adults.<br>  <br>  Hilary Flower researched this question for Adventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyond. She found three important facts that have come from the research of Dr. Ann Prentice in recent years:<br>  <br>     1. Recovery of bone mineral density occurs BEFORE weaning. The recovery begins after the baby's diet begins to be supplemented with other foods or liquids (the "partial breastfeeding phase"). By 12 months breastfeeding mothers have fully recovered their bone mineral density.<br>     2. If a mother becomes pregnant before the recovery is complete, bone mineral density increases during pregnancy, a phenomonon not usually seen.<br>     3. Mothers who are tandem nursing fare the same as their breastfeeding peers.<br>  <br>  Flower comments: "Eventually popular beliefs will catch up to the scientific advances of the last five years, and breastfeeding mothers will no longer have to fend off admonishments that their bones are in jeopardy. For their part, scientists have moved on." (Adventures in Tandem Nursing, p. 213)<br>  <br>  For more on calcium see Calcium.<br>  Nursing and pregnant (added calories)<br>  <br>  Most mothers find that if they simply eat to satisfy their increased hunger they can easily consume enough calories to support the pregnancy and continued lactation. Let your hunger and thirst dictate how much you take in. If you feel hungry, then you need to eat, regardless of how large the amounts may seem. Some mothers notice a decrease in appetite when milk supply decreases later into the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  You will want to gain weight just as you would if you were not nursing: 25-35 pounds is the current recommendation. See also What if I lose weight in the first trimester?<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  Anemia and Iron during pregnancy:<br>  <a href="http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/nutr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/nutr...</a><br>  “One of the great unresolved issues of pregnancy is the significance of a low hematocrit/hemoglobin.<br>  Actually, the studies are clear that lower levels are better, and the unresolved issue is why practitioners continue to encourage iron supplementation and chide women for low levels.<br>  "Normal" values of hematocrit/hemoglobin are determined by studying non-pregnant people. However, a pregnant woman's blood volume expands around 40-60%; this blood volume expansion reduces the concentration of red blood cells and iron in her blood, which is what's measured by hematocrit and hemoglobin.<br>  The best pregnancy outcomes are associated with the lowest hematocrit/hemoglobin. It turns out that 9.5 is optimal. This isn't because pregnant women don't need iron; it's because healthy pregnant women have large increases in blood volume that lower the hematocrit/hemoglobin.<br>  So, in fact, a woman who's having problems with her pregnancy and doesn't have an increasing blood volume will have higher h/h levels than a healthy woman.<br>  There are better ways of assessing anemia in pregnancy; fatigue is a clue, but the best way to assess how well your blood is carrying oxygen is to look for pallor in the gums and under eyelids and to assess capillary refill when you apply pressure to the nailbed. .”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?d..." rel="nofollow">http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?d...</a><br>  “Despite significantly elevated hepatic iron stores after iron supplementation in pregnant rats this had no significant effect upon blood haemoglobin or transferring saturation levels. However the mean weight of the foetuses at Day 20-21 was significantly lower than that of the non-supplemented pregnant rats. Iron supplements significantly increased the activity of NADPH oxidase in the maternal alveolar macrophages, the primary event in the formation of the phagolysosome to combat invading organisms. However inducible nitric oxide synthase activity was significantly reduced in these macrophages as shown by decreases in LPSinduced and LPS+IFN,-induced NOS activation. Iron supplementation to rats of normal iron status at the commencement of pregnancy did not show any beneficial effects to either the foetus or the mother.”<br>  <br>  Iron suppleme.ntation of pregnant individuals with adequate iron status may aggravate oxidative stress [Lachili et al., 2001], with the potential for oxidation of lipids and DNA [Schill and Reilly<br>  2000], a factor which could contribute to preterm delivery,<br>  <br>  Iron supplements to rats which have normal iron status at the commencement of pregnancy appear to induce toxicity in both the mother- a reduced immune function as well as to the offspring- reduced birth weight.<br>  <br>  ------------|`|oScgvcjaaa	yes you can continue breastfeeding while pregnant ,and you and also tandem feed when your new baby arrives .sometime  breastfed babies can self wean early when you get pregnant ,due to the breast milk tasting different,due to your hormones changing .this doesn't always happen ,sometimes baby will happily continue breastfeeding . good luck|`|pDRAciBnaa	hi,i am pregnant and Holly is still BF she is 10mos old,i asked my doc and midwife they both said it is most definatley fine :)<br>  <br>  however later on in prgnancy they both said that your milk may change,whilst its still fine for baby to eat she may not like the taste,as it turns back in to colostrum.<br>  <br>  so i would continue until either one of you choses not to.x|`|v0596BTeaa	Carry on with breastfeeding, it will be fine.

Trust me he knows how to take a bottle... he won't because he knows if he refuses, you will give him breast. once YOU decide and are ready, your baby will be too... once you decide it's enough, you just stop.. if he really wants milk, if he sees you're serious about it, he'll take the bottle... now, please, don't try every single bottle out there.. this will just confuse him, pick one and stick with it; <br>  by the way, at 9 months, they can easily have yogurt, you can give him yogurt instead too... if he prefers it. <br>  but honestly, after having weaned two babies (both of whom very persistant just like your son), i have to say, it all depends on you.<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA: if u have any questions, don't hesitate to message or email me|`|mrphEDWcaa	I have no idea , I am weaning a 23 month old.

My 2nd son walked at 7 months.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	maybe not going to crawl at 14 months baby start to learn to walk
388da11c779e20e095b822848356240daa	Hello, I am 37w 2d have been dilated to 3cm for about a week now. Went into false labor last Sunday for 10 hours and contractions were 4 minutes apart! They said I was dilated but not enough and had a thick but soft cervix, sense this was my second pregnancy having a soft cervix is normal. So that Monday I bought those pills and started taking them that night. 3 Vaginally and the next morning 2 orally, and have been repeating that since. Well I have been losing my mucus plug since and two days ago I lost mucus with a blood tinge to it! So now I am just waiting, and still taking them.<br>  Good luck to you!!!
uFrqC4Y2aa	Low HcG levels?
QOs9SCeOaa	All of the symptoms you described are symptoms of pregnancy you definatly could be pregnant. You should check with your doctor. stop taking any perscriptions in case you are.<br>  Good luck. asnd most likely congrats!|`|16Pfvvijaa	yes u cud be preg what a few days and do another test or else go to docs and get them to do a blood test|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Did you follow the directions properly?If you took the test then reread the results it might give a positive result. If you got a positive right away I would say you're pregnant. Schedulea visit with your doctor.
ZaadvJAXaa	It's quite possible that your results were caused by HPV.  I haven't heard of anything else being caused by it.  Biopsy should have been ok to do even being pregnant.  It should not affect your baby or pregnancy at all.  You may even get lucky and it might clear on its own.  Sometimes, (but not always), this can happen.  Your doctor might do another check soon to see what's going on, but don't be afraid to ask what's going on.  It's your body and your baby.  Depending on what the doctor decides to do, as far as any treatment goes, you should be able to have more children in the future.  Just keep in touch with the doctor about this condition.  Btw, has your doctor not told you what your next course of action should be?  I would be concerned that you should find another doctor soon before you get further along in your pregnancy if this doctor cannot communicate with you about your health.|`|NMzlbWt8aa	Call your dr back with these questions or ask him the next time you go in.  Its weird that he didnt tell you all this while he gave you the results
1uAduUKhaa	After feeding him or giving him his bottle, you might want to try removing his diaper have him play 'bare bottom' dressed in just his t-shirt.   Keep an eye on him and if stops playing, and wiggles, or reaches down and touches his Petey or shows other signs of having to tinkle, bring him to the potty have him aim using both hands.<br>  <br>  And yes.  I recommend Desitin, A&D and babyoil as long as the child needs to be diapered.   Diaper rash is always something a mother needs watch for particularly during the winter months when the weather is cold and the baby is bundled up.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	you have to keep at it. and at my sons school with the little ones they take them to the potty every 15 mins all day. now we started my son training at 2 yrs old- 4 months before his 3rd b-day he was done. he was fully trained but it took a long time. but we didn't force the issue until it was 4 mos before when his daycare was on break, new years 07 and i was pregnant with our 2nd, and was due in 5 mo. and was out of diapers and said i am not going to the store we will stay home and get you trained it took those last 2 days. of course we put him on pull ups at night. but he didn't need them. he never went at night. he had a few accidents after but not much. he was so happy and ready!! you have to make it fun, take him to the potty all the time, let his dad show him the potty, tell grandma to help. my mom would always take him to the toilet when we were over there even when he didn't have to go so he wouldn't be afraid!! put him in underwear- all day when you can and take him to the potty all day.<br>  but i know parents whose boys were still 4 in diapers - gross.|`|bmoCpcdraa	put plastic sheet on bed and cloth sheet on top and let him sleep without diapper so, he can see what it fells like to wet hisself durring the day use them thick underware the cloth ones and deal with it ,set him on tolit every few hours or every time you go,diappers should just be used when he goes out. ya it sucks to wipe up after him all the time but it is the job of a parent, you could cut a slit in the front of diapper since he is a boy,and you should take him to potty about 20 min. after each meal,i hope i helped|`|J5TbYvVZaa	I started a week ahead of time telling my son that he was going to get to go potty in 7 days. We counted down. On the day before we started, I let him help me color a potty chart and let him pick out the stickers for it. We even went to the store to pick out what treats he wanted. I also had him help me put things in his 'potty box' - puzzles, books, trucks that went in the bathroom. I had already purchased underwear and put them in his drawer - where he could reach. On the morning of the big day, we put all his diapers in a box for the baby (his little brother) and took them out of his room. We used a timer the first few days, so he knew that when the timer went off we were heading to the potty. We bought a child urinal - Peter Potty. We had both pottys in there and told him he could pick which one he wanted to use. The first couple days were accident after accident. When he asked for a diaper, I reminded him they were gone. By day 4 he was accident free. We put on 'nite nite pants' (goodnights pullups) and never said diaper again. The other thing I did was keep a log of when he would go to the bathroom and by day 7 we were out and about because I could schedule small errands around his potty schedule. I know all kids are different but I think it really helped him that he was involved in everything and felt like he was making the choice! Good luck and be consistant.
57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I didn't find help with the baby to be that appealing after my first was born.  What I really would have appreciated was someone to clean my house, do my laundry, and take care of errands for me while I took care of my baby.|`|AA10064551	No I didn't but if I were you take the help. When we took my son home our first night was crazy, he wouldn't sleep and when he did, he would wake up once you put him down. We were up all night, and we were worried about every thing. It was so stressful. Then when we got the hang a little more, we would have problems because my boyfriend wasn't the most helpful with the night times so there were never any your turn my turn for tending to my son it was always, moms job. I was exhausted. <br>  Please take the help the nurse will show you what to do and be there to help you especially during those nights and they are there to help you get some rest too because delivering a child is a huge deal, and if you have a C- Section like I did its very hard to do a lot of what is needed to be done.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I didn't, but if they can help with breastfeeding it would have been a lot of help the first week!|`|rAkWoweOaa	that sounds awesome
unq5llX6aa	I was on yaz (low dose combo pill) and stopped sometime last year because of financial reasons.  I started my period exactly on time as I would for my bcp meds.  This month I am in the same boat as you are!  I stopped bcp last month, was due for period today but nothing.  I don't have cramps (normal ones any way) but I don't feel like I'm pregnant.  Some women take a long time to get hormones out of body and some resume normal schedules right away.  The upsetting thing is that AF symptoms are soooo similar to pregnancy symptoms it makes me want to cry.  Nausea, dizzy, exhaustion, frequent urination, and cold issues are both indicators of BOTH AF and pregnancy.  Wait until you actually miss period to test.  Some women do not make enough hormones for pregnancy test to pick up before missing.  I wish you luck!|`|C0tucwv1aa	i would wait a little while & if still no period retest|`|ger4kuefaa	Well your body has to adjust to the lack of hormone. It may be side affects of gettin off BC. Take a test and if it's negative wait for ur period. If it doesn't come wait a week then take it again.
4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	They are supposed to be getting about 24oz throughout the day. Cereal is to help learn to eat, as well as fruits and veggies. She's still getting most of her nutrition through the milk. Try to cut back the other stuff a little or offer the milk first. When in doubt ask the dr. This was the advice they gave me when we had the same stuff going on. If she's teething it will affect her appetite too.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Your baby knows what it wants, as long as you listen you will be told, so many young mother miss their babies communications because there not paying attention, advice turn of the TV and listen to the child, soap opera's diminish the brain, you will know the difference in tone what the baby wants just pay attention, always plenty of fluids.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Amber is 6 months and is still only eating 4oz and also doesn't always finnish it...and she's no light weight either at 20lbs <br>  <br>  So I say it's fine as long as your baby is gaining weight normally and the dr isn't concerned about anything!|`|bqlvntzEaa	It depends on how often your baby takes a bottle. Some take them every 4 hrs some a little further apart. My daughter was eating 3 times a day around 7 months but not long before that. She takes 8 oz at a time though. As long as she is getting what she needs during the day, it should be ok. I think she should have between 24-32 oz/day.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	It doesn't really matter how much she eats at a sitting.  What matters is how much she's getting in a full day.  How many times does she eat a day?  She should be eating at least around 20 ounces of formula a day along with solids.|`|AA10064551	No I think its okay, In a 24 hour period, My son does two 6 ounce bottles and probably 4-6 4 ouncers per day. He also eat about 2-3 tubs of stage one baby veggies and sometime rice cereal. He is 18lbs.|`|vg9C2TqQaa	i dont think its a big problem. my little brother is 10 months and we're lucky if he eats 5 or 6. at 7 months, your baby should be eating more than just cereal and gerber. try feeding her cream of wheat. its healthy and babies normally love it. some babies dont drink bottles well after eating food. feed her real fruits and vegetables. if it really concerns yiu, talk to your doctor, especiallly if she is very light or thin. whatever she doesnt drink, put into oatmeal so she ends up eating it. i hope this helps!!|`|eIjiI0M8aa	It depends on how often your baby takes a bottle.

8WbfmK5daa	Yes Braxton hicks can occur at anytime throughout the pregnancy and become more frequent towards the end. <br>  <br>  Mine typically last between 5 mins too and at the most 7 mins. <br>  <br>  They should be no cause for concern its a normal thing to experience during pregnancy :)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	hum, good question. I've never timed mine. So I'm not really sure. It seems a while though. lol|`|QT5ROElraa	i had braxton hix so bad... they started around month 7, and i had them up until i had my baby boy at week 42. <br>  <br>  The way you can tell braxton hix apart from the real labor is (i learned this after making 3 false trips to the hospital) your tummy gets really hard with both. The difference is that with real contractions your upper half of the tummy gets so hard u cannot push it in even like 1/4 of an inch just above your belly button. This is what a nurse told me and it helped me. <br>  <br>  I had braxton hix 5 mins apart for sometimes 3 days and nights in a row. i had to breath through them, and it was tough. i was sometimes in tears because i was so frustrated! sometimes one contraction can last from 30 seconds up to 6 mins! I hope you don't have the ones that just go on and on...|`|YI31TqNNaa	first off, you should make sure that it really is braxton hicks by changing activity. lay down or take a hot bath, and see if the contractions persist. i only have 1 week left until my due date, and still have not experienced braxton hicks, so i honestly have no idea what they feel like! i do know every woman is different though, and they probably do last longer for some women than others|`|mKUMsE5jaa	I think you should be fine, as long as they don't hurt...  Braxton Hicks are only supposed to be small tightening's of the uterus to get you warmed up for the big nasties later on.  If they don't go away or get worse i would go to the hospital.  you may be going into pre-labor.  Just to be safe!|`|i0hN5gbbaa	Yes its normal, from 3 to 8 min in my experience, when contractions are regular every7 to 5 min apart
AA11348933	My first baby was 10 days early.<br>  My second was 11 days early.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I was due on january 11th with my first and had her on january 10th so I was right on schedule.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I was 10 days overdue with my daughter and delivered on my due date with my son.|`|9cu82009aa	3 days before her due date, due Oct 6 born Oct 3.<br>  It's funny they say you usually go over with the first but as you can see she was born 3 days before. <br>  My second and third were both overdue and the forth I wanted an epidural so they induced me @ 39wks (Jan 22) because I have quick labours and they wouldn't have had time to give me the epidural (although when they went to put the gel in I was already 5cm so I would have gone in to labour that day or the next anyways). My second was 6 days overdue, although she did come out fast (16min labour), she was born a week before her sisters 3rd birthday. My third was 2 days overdue and born on her eldest sisters 5th birthday.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	four days early with my first baby and five with my second.

She was due on wed. the 18th, but she was induced yesterday the 19th and had her little girl just after 10 last night. Not really sure why they induced her for delivery just one day after her due date, I know a lot of doctors don't induce until 2 weeks after the baby's due date, unless there is a problem with the baby or mother. Also she ended up having to have a c-section, because after they broke her water, she started having some contractions, but she never dilated, so they took the baby via. c-section. And during the c-section her little girl had to be pushed down, because of how high she was still laying. Stubborn little one, she didn't want to come out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and congrats on your little one.|`|AA10015577	I had an EDD for March 9th and then they switched it to March 15th and then back.

703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	He could through your belly if he is up against it, but not through the vagina.  Not only is the baby past your closed cervix and mucus plug, but he's also floating in a sac of amniotic fluid.  I had to explain this to my brother, who asked me after one of my third trimester OB visits if the doctor could see the baby's head.  LOL.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I'm gonna say no unless he's lying on top of your belly or in some way touching your stomach. He can not feel the baby moving, especially on his penis, if that is what he is implying.

It will guide you.|`|KN2nwZk3aa	Call Dr ....now!|`|711ff7c6324ba6361ad31a16ee95d14eaa	First, check to see if the blood is "in" the bowel, or streaking on the outside of the bowel.  I know it sounds gross - and it is.  But the MD will ask.<br>  <br>  They will want to know the color - is it bright red, or purplish.  If it is bright red, and streaking, then there is a good chance it is not an internal problem, but instead, there might be a tear on the rectum - maybe resulting from a large BM, or wiping too hard.  If this is the case, it will likely resolve in a couple of days without any problems.  You would want to check on it with your doctor, but it probably isn't anything to be scared about.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if there is a darker shade, or if it appears to be "inside" the stool, you need to get the baby in the car and to the ER immediately as that indicates a bigger problem.  As gross as it is, take the dirty diaper with you in case they need to do lab work on a stool sample.  If they don't need it, they will throw it away at the hospital.<br>  <br>  Either way, definately call the MD office.  Don't feel like an over concerned parent - it's better to be overly cautious than not careful enough!|`|NVjf66edaa	Depends on if the blood is mixed in with the stool or simply smeared along the outside of the stool.  If it's along the side, it could be that his stool is too hard to easily push out, so it's causing some rectal bleeding (my 9 year old gets this every couple of months and I FREAKED the first time or two).  If this is the case, make sure your child is getting enough water and/or liquids and not too much dairy.  Too much milk or cheese can cause hard stools in children.  You may also want to slip some prunes into his diet to help soften the stools (but not too many, or you'll have the *opposite* problem!).<br>  <br>  IF, however, the blood is really mixed in with the stool, absolutely contact your doctor.  You don't say how often this is happening, how much blood there is, etc., but spending 6 hours in the ER to be told your kid needs more water or juice (100% juice, not Kool Aid!) can be a major pain in the... well, let's just not go there :)|`|9o8GGcSVaa	Go to the emergency room
oiJITSNZaa	your may have a hormonal imbalance. All the symptoms that you have described may simply be pre-period symptoms|`|wSso1HsLaa	Maybe go to a Doctor..

rdGQMSyjaa	I completely agree with "Alyssa's Mommy". Why should the "father" have any say when they are not only not married, but they're also not even together? Although it may be both of their baby, because obviously it takes two people to make a baby, it's technically "her's" right now. Is the father even planning on being in his child's life, or does he just want to name it because it's "his"? <br>  <br>  EDIT: That's terrible of him. Can't he leave his ex alone? She's obviously not very happy with him right now. He should be more concerned about HIS CHILD whom  he may or may not even see/want to see, instead of the childs name at this point!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Unmarried and daddy has no say.<br>  <br>  Edit: You do realize that woman doesn't even have to call and notify the ex that the kid was born?

If they can meet the same criteria that every other potential adopter must meet then I suppose it's fine.  I would like the stipulation put in there that they are either single or if they are in a relationship that they don't do anything in front of the child that could confuse him/her until they are old enough to understand that homosexuality isn't something "fun" to play with in their life.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I don't believe homosexuals should adopt because they have chosen (yes, CHOSEN) a lifestyle that prevents them from having children.  God said man shall not lay with man or animal.  It is an abomination in the eyes of God. God said man shall lay with woman *after marriage* and bear children.  <br>  <br>  *sigh*  If it's o.k. by the case worker/homestudy worker/CASA worker and they meet the state standards...then...for the kids sake....go ahead.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	My parents are gay and I think it's fine, obviously. For me it was, anyway. I'm not on board with infant adoptions or agencies (for anyone - sexuality has nothing to do with it), but as far as foster-care or special needs adoptions go, hell yes I think it's a good idea! There's thousands of wonderful children festering away in foster and group homes, bounced from place to place, living out of a suitcase. It's just silly to deny anyone who's willing to give a child a loving and stable home.<br>  <br>  The neo-cons of this country like to spread hateful rumors about gays and lesbians, but it's bunk. I can assure you that my parents being gay has not:<br>  - affected my mental health (biggest lie religion tells about gay and lesbian parents) - in fact, my time with my parents helped me gradually heal from the psychological trauma of my straight but completely insane mother<br>  - indoctrinated me into a strange culture<br>  - turned me gay or confused me about sexuality (second biggest lie religion likes to spread)<br>  - exposed me to sexuality earlier than anyone else (the media, however, has done a nice job of that)<br>  - made me a martyr or a sacrificial lamb (biblical references from the neo-cons) for the so-called "gay agenda"<br>  - isolated me in society<br>  <br>  Honestly, I'd say that aside from being adopted later in childhood and that I was already an unusual child, my home was just like everyone else's. I don't think my parent's sexuality ever really affected me or made anything really different, other than not having a mother and the occasional rude remark from others.<br>  We're just a normal family, I cannot understand why people would want to say that it is wrong or that we shouldn't have been allowed to be a family.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	I think if the child is going to a loving home, it is irrelevent if the couple is straight or gay.  Children need a stable home.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	As long as they pass the background checks and are good stable people who cares?
hSriLiWGaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Good to hear you have already increased your fiber intake. A few more things you can do to aid in curing your hemorrhoid include:<br>  ? Try to maintain high hydration levels – drink lots of water<br>  ? Avoid lifting heavy weights<br>  ? Avoid constipation by eating foods which are high in fiber (vegetables and cereals are great sources of fiber). As you increase you intake of fiber it is important to increase you fluid intake proportionally.<br>  ? Exercise daily. Even if you don’t have time to do a lot of exercise – a 20 minute walk can do wonders for your body as well as helping to keep bowel movements regular.<br>  ? Avoid sitting or standing for long periods of time, take short walks from time to time where possible. Try to lye on your side where possible to reduce pressure. <br>  You can relieve pain by soaking in the bath 3 times daily and also by applying ice to the area.<br>  <br>  Natural remedies are definitely a great way to cure hemorrhoids. I personally used these and they helped me a lot. <br>  <br>  A couple of home remedies include:<br>  One trick which works well to relieve the itching and burning sensation caused by hemorrhoids is to apply a small amount of vinegar to the hemorrhoid. Apart from reducing the itching of the hemorrhoid, the vinegar will also work to bring down the swelling of the hemorrhoid.<br>  <br>  Another form of natural hemorrhoid relief is to apply the Aloe Vera to the hemorrhoid. This can be done by cutting an Aloe Vera leaf open and gently rubbing the Aloe Vera gel onto the hemorrhoid. Doing this helps to minimize swelling.<br>  <br>  I have provided a link below to a page all about Home Hemorrhoid Cures – I think you may find it useful.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Heather-Jane|`|wqgQ3fHqaa	I struggled with hemorrhoids for years, until I found a system that cured my hemorrhoids in 2 days using completely natural methods at home.

Signs and symptoms last one to five days, and most people recover completely without treatment. <br>  <br>  Norovirus infection during pregnancy is a big concern because it can cause dehydrationin pregnant women.

YeMI2xwiaa	There is no set age. Sometimes infants do it without realizing. Girls can start as young as 7 with innocent exploring of their bodies.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	There's no precise age|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Many young girls do it before they even reach puberty.  They don't realize it's masturbation of course, but even young children know it feels good to touch themselves.  In general though, start whenever you start to have sexual feelings and want to experiment with what feels good to your body.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	You two are some sick and twisted b'stards.

Sure, your baby will probably be fine, but there's still a pretty good chance he/she will have breathing problems and have signs of prematurity because there won't be any labor and it's still early in the "full term" window.  <br>  <br>  There was a study recently that showed every day between 37 and 39 weeks made measurable differences in how well the babies did.  If your baby has breathing problems, it's more likely that he/she will have to stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and be separated from you.  The average labor-starting date for first-time mothers is 41 weeks and 1 day, not 38 weeks.  This means your baby could be three weeks early born at 38 weeks, which would be the same as a baby who would have been ready at 38 weeks being born at 35 weeks, which is considered early enough to stop labor.  <br>  <br>  If there is a true medical need for your c-section (and I kind of doubt it since you weren't rushed to the OR immediately), then the risks of birth via major abdominal surgery is often outweighed by the risks of waiting it out.  However, if there is no very good medical reason to have a cesarean, the risks usually outweigh any benefits.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd go to the ICAN web site and look at the articles on good versus poor reasons for cesareans, the procedure, risks, and recovery.  Also consider all the risks to your future reproductive health.  It is getting harder and harder for women to get VBACs nowadays, and not because they're unsafe.  In fact, Time Magazine just put out an article about it: <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1880665-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a><br>  <br>  From the ICAN list, you can join forums and email lists where you can ask about your cesarean and get great advice from a lot (there are thousands in ICAN) who have been where you are.  Chances are, no matter how unique your situation is, that there are other women in ICAN who can relate with you because they've been there.  From this page, <a href="http://ican-online.org/pregnancy/home," rel="nofollow">http://ican-online.org/pregnancy/home,</a> you can see the links on the lefthand side for articles and information that might be good for you to know.  At the top of the page, you can go to the "Recovery" section and see what to expect after surgery and how to make it easier on yourself.<br>  <br>  If you are having a medically necessary surgery, it will still help you to view all of this information and make certain you know what will happen and how to get what you will need postpartum/post-surgery.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy birth wishes!|`|7HzfgRmwaa	CONGRATS!!!!!! Your baby should be just fine!! Enjoy your last weekend before the baby!! Try to get out and do something special/fun!|`|8XUEz3W4aa	You and the baby will be fine.

M6c0hUefaa	Yay!...LOL, I know I sound like a sap, but I love babies....    No, my daughter wasn't planned  Yes, we want one more, but then again I don't know, I  may want two more.  Not necessarily a "plan" but I believe once my daughter turns 2, we're going to "try" for another one....so that'll be around March of 2010 for us.     Good for you guys and good that you both decided on it and agreed together. I hope when you try you do get your girl, from what you've said and some of your other posts you have two boys right?...Girls are so fun, but I'm sure boys are too. :) Good luck!|`|KHZLPldraa	YAY FOR YOU!! CONGRATS!    Were your children planned?   *My first was a surprise 12 years ago, second was planned took a long, long time (4 1/2years)and with help of fertility treatments, the third (22 weeks now) was a huge surprise as there was no trying or fertility help.    Do you want any more?   That would be a no.  Three is enough, we have a almost 13 year old girl, a 17 month old girl, and baby boy due June 13th!  Thats enough!    Do you already have a plan to conceive another child?  Uhm no, my tubes will be cut, tied, burned whatever needs to be done!  LOL  :)|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Congrats!!    Lol Jamie wasn't planned and he's the only one for a while....|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Ya for you!  that is awesome.  you brought a smile to my face this morning.  My daughter - 1st was planned.  we actually were gonna wait another year before we started trying for her but husband gave the go ahead to try earlier.    My son - was earlier than we expected.  we wanted another one but i wanted to wait a little longer.  i actually had a RX for bc pills waiting at the pharmacy when I found out i was pregnant w/him.  I want one more, very badly but I've had such a hard time carrying babies.  i've never had an issue conceiving its just keeping them.....  i don't know what we are going to do..|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	That's great!

My son was planned. We thought we were done until just a few weeks ago when we decided we were going to try for  2! We didn't tell anyone we were ttc the first time.

So we wern't really trying but if it happened we'd be excited.  No, we don't want anymore. One is plenty for us hah  No plans to concieve.
Q3x0yfmtaa	It's one of those curses of pregnancy. LOL, I remember drooling on myself a couple times in early pregnancy. The worst thing though was I had excess saliva AND a rancid taste in my mouth all the time. Even after I brushed my teeth. I was brushing like 7 times or more a day and I think that just made it worse...|`|1IDSGM71aa	She can't, as far as I know,. Eventually she'll probably get used to it. Why does she have to spit a lot?|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Eat some crackers but it is really commom|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Gag, I had this too, it made brushing teeth a miserable experience.|`|nVMAOJd7aa	Crap! I had this with my first child. It later lead to massive heartburn throughout the whole pregnancy . The only thing that helped me with that was  cold water, water and more water! Stay away from ice tea! If there is a way to avoid this, I wish I knew the answer to it. Congrats to your co-worker!!|`|PRaTLk8laa	When your pregnant you have excess everything!  I would recommend a handkerchief to dab her mouth occasionally. She could also drink water.  Swallowing may help to keep the saliva to a minimum.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	I found it really difficult to make it stop with anything until it naturally went away after 12 weeks of pregnancy. She will have to bear with it for as long as she can.
ZS7MM6Xvaa	I've been experiencing the same thing! I'm also 18 weeks, almost 19, and even though I know it's still a little early, it does make me nervous when I go a while without feeling the baby move.  I think the person who suggested drinking something sweet and then laying down is right.  I've noticed eating sugary foods (ice cream! yum!) then laying on the couch for a bit almost always produces some squirms.  Congrats and good luck!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You probably won't feel regular, daily movement where the kicks and punches are obvious and strong for at least another month. What you're feeling now is totally normal.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	It`s normal he/she still has alot of room to move around.sometimes still at just about 26 weeks my lil man still gets his lazy days.if u continue to worry about drank something sweet and lay down for a while that usually helped me when he didn't move alot.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Normal|`|GnFCTnRCaa	yeah, all normal. the baby is still so small, you probably aren't feeling most of his movements. just the ones that are strong and close to the front of the uterus.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's normal to feel a little movement and not movement everyday at this stage. You don't have to start kick counts until 28 weeks.
Bw1h5xAcaa	Do you mean genetic as in inhertiable conditions? Sometimes there can be things that can be inherited which would make a miscarriage or stillbirth more likely. But most stillbirths are completely random events related to non-inheritable conditions.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It would depend on the reason.  Most still births are just one-time tragedies, but there can certainly be genetic factors that make miscarriage/stillbirth more likely.      If there was just one in your family, it was almost certainly just an unavoidable tragedy that will not recur. (THis is especially true if this was back in the 'old days' when infant mortality rates were much higher.)|`|95s0Dlg9aa	No. If you eat improperly, and you smoke or something, have pressures on you, hormonal stuff it can happen. It's not like diseases or cancer. But if  it's hard for you to get pregnant then there's a chance of problems.
rmse6Mj8aa	it is advised never to leave it more than 5 days between ejaculations or the sperm quality suffers     if you have sex once a day every day there should be no problem with sperm building up again. assuming your partner is healthy and has no problems with sperm count, it takes 24 hours for sperm to be replenished after an ejaculation.    if there is a known issue with sperm count it is advised to have sex every other day through your fertile time.    best of luck x|`|gLXzVbm8aa	we have done it up to 5 times a day and we've had no problems with his sperm coming out|`|BaXruEcqaa	they say its best to have sex every other day if you are ttc.|`|lTAORAPraa	lmaoo you should spunk at least once a day its healthy|`|aOTHHRS1aa	If you have sex daily, your sperm count will be lower then if you were to say, wait 3 days.|`|jezafgESaa	Every body builds up Sperm different... It will depend on you... Some guys can release their sperm 3 times during a sex ... If you can get your penis hard soon after you released your sperm... You can have the same sperm count...|`|2FpRjoQKaa	i read and they say at least 3 days for sperms to replenish.|`|vue9NOhYaa	"They" usually do recommend every other day rather than daily sex to give you the best chance of conception.  But for most men with normal sperm counts, it really doesn't matter.  So have sex when the two of you want to.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Usually it's recommended to have sex every other day when trying to conceive because having sex can lower the sperm count. Also remember that sperm can live inside you for a few days so if you had sex yesterday and skipped today and you ovulate today, the sperm from yesterday are still there.|`|ptert8E6aa	it takes about three minutes for sperms
Bw1h5xAcaa	It's within the normal range. But one HCG level doesn't tell you much of anything - what's important is that it rises, approximately doubling every 2-3 days.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Sounds ok but you want to make sure it doubles every day and a half
1IDSGM71aa	I would say pretty quickly since it loses it's effectiveness if you don't take it at the same time every day.

THe minipill, in particular, needs to be taken at the same time each day or it has a high failure rate.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	by mini pill im guessing u mean birth control? each ir only good for 1 day, thats y u have to take them daily ... when i got off bc i got pregnant like a week later.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	it depends on the person but i think its rougly 2-3 months.
umGzyElZaa	Well I know when I was prego what helped the most was when I woke up I layed really still and ate like 3 crackers and waited a few mins before getting out of bed, that helped a lot!  Also the preggo pops are AWESOME..you can get them at Babies R Us, Motherhood, and online. Those are good cause you really dont wanna eat all day and if you are like I was, I felt like I HAD to!  Lemon heads are good too! Another thing I did was I ate tums like a mad woman! They helped me with nausea a bit. My Dr gave me these things called Sea Bands, you wear them around your wrist, supposed to work like pressure point...I dont know if they distracted me or if they really did work...but I was desperate and tried EVERYTHING.   Hope this helped...hang in there! It wont last long :o) Congrats!!|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	Try eating a banana, the potassium can settle your stomach.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Crackers, ginger, name it, nothing works for me!

pR4nLjyRaa	Some women get symptoms pretty quickly (like a week or so after ovulation) but for alot of women symptoms don't kick in til 5-6 weeks. Some of the first symptoms you may notice are fatigue, larger/sore breasts and possibly morning sickness. Good luck!|`|pnZssBg9aa	Do you have morning sickness?  Did you feel any spasms or contractions in your groin or area near your uterus or vagina?  Do you feel that 'there is something'?  If so then yes you are pregnant.     Otherwise you have a 40% chance of being pregnant, because sperm and semen can last for up to 2 days and you have a window period of 5 days for your ovulation.

GBC39wHAaa	gp is general practitioner but what you need a fertility clinic if you are looking for an egg donor.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If you have fertility problems, you need to speak with your regular doctor. HE will, refer you to a fertility specialist, who will examine you and do tests to determine exactly what the trouble is.  THEN, if you have a problem best treated with IVF (rather than, say, fertility drugs, or surgery), he will refer you to a local clinic.    If (as another question suggests) you are wanting to be a gestational surrogate, that's another issue entirely, and I'd just recommend googling it for more info on how to get started.
bmoCpcdraa	about 2 years old , they should be in headstart by 4, don't buy any more diappers, get him some thick cloth underware, and if he pees in them to bad, take him potty everytime you go, and 20 min. after he eats, if you can't potty traine him soon ,he will behind in school. the teacher will not wipe his butt, that is your job. they will make you waite another year to send him to school and even call the welfare on you, no im not being mean but , they will think your lazy or the child has mental issues, so do your job. i hope i helped|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Yeah, youre a little late but we all know that every kid is different. My 23 month old is doing his business on the toilet most of the time, but yet i have a friend whose kid is nearly 4 and just is in the middle of potty training. Depending on how busy, hectic, etc your life is and how much time you have to work with your little ones is also relative to how fast you can potty train them. I think that about 2 is a good age to start if they are showing signs of being ready.|`|tEmnBO5Kaa	My son is 18 months old and I just bought him a potty today.  He doesn't speak yet and is not ready to start training but it is good to let them sit on it and get acquainted to the potty.  He loves it!   He is sitting on it and just getting familiar with it.  You are starting late.  I would buy a potty ASAP and let him get familiar with it.  They sell really cure ones that play music when they go potty in it.  Good Luck!|`|hh5E9n4Oaa	I would begin now, he should be interested by now.  In fact, I read that a four year old is possibly easier to potty train than a two or even three year old.  I started my son at almost three after losing patience when he was barely two and he seems to be catching on to it real well.  Good luck!|`|gFiRi5xnaa	You're a little behind, my boyfriend was fully potty-trained at 1 1/2. It's going to be difficult. He's definitely ready to start learning, Good luck.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	What Madame Zzz says. Don't.|`|NVjf66edaa	Every single child is unique and takes potty training in their own way, in their own time.<br>  <br>  My first refused to even contemplate it until after his 3rd birthday (peer pressure worked - his 2nd cousin was a month younger and already fully potty trained!).  My second son told me when he was 26 months old, "No more diapers, mom.  Big boy undies."  He also had a LOT more accidents than my first son ever did!  My stepson was fully trained at our house just before age 3, but he didn't stop having night accidents at his biological mother's house until closer to 4 (she is abusive - he also had nightmares there but never at our house).<br>  <br>  I'm now a stay at home mom with my 4th son and he is 32 months old.  I do not push potty training in any way.  He has several little potties, and a seat cushion thing, but I leave it up to him to decide whether or not to use them.  I don't like the idea of bribing them, but you could consider it (if you pee, you get X, if you poop, you get XX).  However, I think you need to remember that your child will NOT go to college still wearing diapers.  <br>  <br>  Despite pressure on parents to push EVERYTHING on their kids at younger and younger ages (sleep through the night, sleep in their own beds, stop nursing, stop the bottle, stop the binkie, potty train, talk, sing, dance, read, blah blah blah!), you know your child best.  I think you have a lot more success with everything if you simply accept him as he is and let him mature at his own rate.  The more you focus on what he is NOT doing yet (unlike little Johnny down the street or whatever), the more you show your child that you do not love him unconditionally.<br>  <br>  I say don't sweat it.  He'll do it when he's ready and probably when you least expect it.  Is he around kids his own age and watching them potty?  If not, that could help motivate him.  Or, he might just not care and want to do things his own way :)|`|ofz43OY4aa	the only age to start potty training is when your child is ready, this can be as young as 18 months up until 3 or 4 years of age and beyond! your child decides when they are ready, rushing them is never a good idea as this can put them off! wait until they start to tell you they are wet and need a change, this is the best indication!|`|JvM44Bx5aa	Most children are potty trained between the ages of two and four. Some are ready sooner; others take longer and may not be ready to potty train until age five.  However, there is no right or wrong age for potty training.<br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/potty-chair-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/potty-chair-20</a>
TdiuwtM5aa	no just probably contractions but you can still go to the doctor|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If you are worried you should call the doctors office or the after hour nurse line. Showing up at the hospital will just result in you standing around waiting for hours for something the nurse could have probably helped with over the phone. Plus I don't know what kind of insurance you have but my insurance charges $500 to go to the ER.<br>  <br>  Drink a  glass of water, grab your phone, go lay down on your side in bed and call the nurse line.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I had something like that when I was pregnant with my daughter on the left side sort of like under my ribs. it hurt alot I thought something was wrong for sure turns out I was just constipated which I found out after going to the emergency room. You should contact your doctor just to make sure everything is okay but it doesnt mean something is wrong so try and relax.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	could be the baby turning around, if it was dull pain and it becomes sharp it could be apendicitis. get it double checked just to be sure. better to not take risks when you're prego.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i had the same exact pains/problems, i called the doctor, and it is just more expanding pains. that's it, nothing to really worry about.|`|seU9VwIJaa	I'd call the triage or on-call nurse and ask them. If you feel like something is wrong, they will most likely have you come in.<br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|kw80YHMLaa	Sounds like early braxtion hicks contractions go to the hospital just to be safe and to put your mind at ease good luck|`|TSxbN0Asaa	I would call your doctor of midwife first. Usually it is normal to have little pains here and there during pregnancy. Good luck and I hope you feel better.|`|6ErVPePEaa	The best thing to do is to call your Doctor or which ever doctor is on call and ask them|`|VHgfWPS2aa	I would go to the hospital if your scared|`|0vcm3pTkaa	You need to call your doctor and ask him or her.|`|lUSj480Oaa	I would call ur doc and ask him if you should go to the hospital or not|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Sounds to me like a pinched nerve, Ouch!|`|cn91FeWcaa	dont worry but u should contact ur doctor
Tr4Vj7RIaa	I don't know anything about teething tablets but here are some things that may help you some.  You can use baby orajel, massage her gums, wet a washcloth with cold water and let her chew on it and/or a cold teething ring.  Infant tylenol or motrin will help with pain.  I hope this help you and your baby.|`|u94HOVz7aa	worked wonders for my dd's but also colic tablets are nice too|`|4ztXoIDKaa	If you have nothing on hand put one of her wet washclothes in the fridge and let her cew on it frozen.  I've never used these teething tablets, actually I've never heard of them.  I'll have to check in to it.<br>  Best wishes.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Get more then just those tablets.  My son didn't get any relieve from them.  This is what I got: teething tablets, baby oragel(if ok'd by MD), Tylenol, pacifiers that have ridges on it specifically for teething, and every size shape and color of teething ring, and a teething towel(purchased at Babies R Us-it had different textures to bite on).  Good luck!|`|H2ZMDc4Iaa	If you'd like a non-medical way of treating teething, i'd suggest buying a fresh food feeder, and putting crushed ice in it then letting her suck on it. The coldness will numb her gums, and she'll get a little water from it. Can be messy so use a bib. And the RazBaby teething binky is a lifesaver!!!<br>  <br>  Also, they say letting them chew alot helps, or massaging their gums. It always worked for my baby if she'd let you do it lol.<br>  <br>  Teething tablets never worked for us, and those teething biscuits are horrible. Orajel should never be given at nighttime (although they make a bedtime formula) because it gets mixed in with their saliva and can numb their throat, causing a choking hazzard.<br>  <br>  The best solution is some tylenol, chewing, and anything cold.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	she is old enough. They work wonders!!! i gave them to my son when he was three months old
aL4UoRdTaa	I am so sorry for your loss.  I understand what it's like to have a loss and to be consumed with TTC and wanting to get pregnant again.    What helped me was this website.  It helps you time your bed time so that you can have sex while you are ovulating.  That is the most important thing and many women somehow miss this.  The website is www.fertilityfriend.com    How are you dealing with your grief?  If you want more support or want to talk more you can visit this message board I set up for women who have had a pregnancy or infant loss. Right now our membership is small but we are loving, knowledgeable, and we now how to have fun (when appropriate).  http://alovingjourney.freeforums.org/|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Just keep good care of yourself and watch your cycles...sorry about your loss|`|ROJans2Taa	I too experienced a miscarriage, it took me 4 mths to conceive again, average couple usually take up to a year anyway, just keep trying and dont stress if it dsont happen right away, they only consider it a problem if you exceed the year of trying, im sorry for your loss, i know how you just wanna pick up and get pregnant again, best luck|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it's best not to try at all, if u do, u kind of put ur body under stress not knowing it. usually people get pregnant when they don't intend to. so just relax, enjoy the sex, and i'm sure it'll happen when it's meant to :)|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	Don't try. The more you TRY to get pregnant, the longer it will take you! Good Luck!|`|k4c24zblaa	Keep taking your prenatal vitamins and try to conceive on the days your ovulating.. Everyone is different, but some good news is you are most fertile after a miscarriage. I fell pregnant before I even got my period after my miscarriage, so there is hope! Keep your head up and I'm sorry for your loss, no matter how far along you are, it's still tough to lose one! Good Luck hun!|`|3gMytPXhaa	In the same way what u did beforee miscarriage.
pR4nLjyRaa	Won't know til you test. good luck!|`|N6vEZVNEaa	YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT|`|THZEgP3waa	im freaking out myself.  its such a strain having to wait to take a test.  i took one yesterday and four days ago both negatives.  dont you just wish you could take one every time you pee until you know for sure if you are or not?  morning pee is best but some tests will find it out no matter what time of day.   being paranoid is totally normal, im going through the same thing myself.  your temperature raising could be a sign, but how many other symptoms do you have?  being stressed out will only delay your period longer if you arent pregnant, so try to relax and be patient until that test day.  i know, easier said than done.
pR4nLjyRaa	The test is probably right. They are pretty accurate starting the day of your missed period. good luck!|`|N6vEZVNEaa	YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A BABY GOOD LUCK
