31oOryfoaa	Well it depends on how much you weigh and if you plan on eating before you consume alcohol.

I wouldnt get 'drunk' though.|`|9z7k8HCXaa	On average you start to process 1 unit of alcohol per each hour 1 hour after you start drinking.     eg.  if you drink 1 glass of wine ( say a large glass 250ml equalling 2 units) at 10 pm, it will take 1 hour for the alcohol to be processed by the body. It will then take a further 1 hour for 1 unit of alcohol to leave the blood stream and 1 hour per 1 unit for every hour after that. ( so drinking 2 units will take 3 hours to get rid of)    So always think 1 hour per unit + 1 hour.      Many drink driving convictions are picked up the following day. If you are intending on having a heavy session, give the car a miss the following day!
OgT00dW4aa	Here's an orange ice cream pie that my family loves during the hot summer months!    Chocolate Orange Pie:    1 cup miniature marshmallows  1 cup (6 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips  1 cup evaporated milk  1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened  1 pint orange sherbet, softened  1 graham cracker crust (9 inches)  1/3 cup coarsely chopped pecans     Directions:   In a saucepan, combine the marshmallows, chocolate chips and milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until melted. Remove from the heat. Cool completely     Meanwhile, alternately arrange scoops of ice cream and sherbet in crust; smooth top. Pour chocolate sauce over pie; sprinkle with pecans. Cover and freeze for at least 4 hours. May be frozen for up to 2 months. Yield: 6-8 servings.      Or you could make your favorite lemon pie and substitute orange juice and zest for the lemon juice and zest!

It tastes like the orange cream sicles. It was really good. The texture was like a pudding pie.|`|EITcvAf2aa	I've been making this one for about 30 years. It's worthwhile. A family favorite.    Orange Meringue Pie    Pastry    2 cups all purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon salt  2/3 cup vegetable shortening  2 tablespoons ice water ( or more)  2 cups fresh orange juice  12 tablespoons unsalted butter; sliced  1 1/2 tablespoons grated orange zest  1/2 cup fresh lemon juice  2 teaspoons grenadine syrup  Filling  6 tablespoons cornstarch  3 tablespoons all purpose flour  1 cup sugar  1/4 teaspoon salt  1 cup boiling water  5 egg yolks; lightly beaten  Meringue  5 egg whites; at room temperature  1/4 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar  1/2 cup sugar; plus 2 tablespoons sugar    Method    Combine the flour, salt and shortening in a large mixing bowl, and  cut in  the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  With a fork, stir in only enough ice water to enable the dough to be  gathered into a ball.  Flatten the ball into a disk, wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for  at  least 1 hour.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into an 11 inch  round.  Without stretching, fit the pastry into a 9 inch pan.  Trim, leaving a 1/2 inch overhang all around; discard the pastry  scraps or reserve for another purpose.  Tuck under the excess pastry and crimp to make a decorative edge.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat the oven to 425 F.  Line the pastry with aluminum foil and weigh down with aluminum pie  weights or dried beans to prevent the pastry from bubbling.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp and golden.  Cool on a rack.  PREPARE THE FILLING:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornstarch, flour, sugar and  salt.  Stirring constantly, pour in the boiling water and blend until  smooth.  Add the egg yolks and orange juice and beat until smooth.  Transfer the filling to the top of a double boiler over, but not  touching, boiling water and cook, stirring frequently, for 15 to 20  minutes.  When the mixture is very thick, remove it from the heat.  Add the butter, orange zest, lemon juice and grenadine; stir until  the butter  melts.  Cover with a round of waxed paper place directly on the surface and  let the filling cool to room temperature.  Pour into the pre-baked pie shell, cover with waxed paper and chill  for at least 5 hours or overnight.  PREPARE THE MERINGUE:  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Place the egg whites in a bowl, add the salt and beat until the  whites are foamy.  Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form.  Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until the whites are  stiff and very glossy.  Do no over beat or the meringue will be dry.  Pile the meringue on the filling, mounding it in the center and  spreading it out to the edge of the crust to seal well.  Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes, or until the meringue  is golden. Let cool and chill for 3 hours before serving.  To slice neatly, use a knife dipped into boiling water before making  each cut.|`|HsGj95jMaa	Orange Pie  http://cooking-service.synthasite.com/?q...|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I make an orange cream pie, and an orange no bake cheese cake. They are out there.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Orange Meringue Pie       1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust   3/4 cup sugar   1/3 cup cornstarch   1 pinch salt   1 cup orange juice   1/2 cup lemon juice   1/4 cup water   4 eggs, separated   4 tablespoons butter or margarine, cut into pieces   2 teaspoons grated orange zest   1/2 cup diced orange segments   1/2 cup white sugar   1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar         DIRECTIONS  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line pastry with aluminum foil and a layer of pie weights or dried beans. Bake in the preheated oven until edge of crust is golden, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights; bake about 5 minutes more.   In a small saucepan, stir together the 3/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cornstarch, and salt. Mix in the orange juice, lemon juice, and water. Whisk in the egg yolks. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thick and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in butter and orange zest. If desired; stir in diced orange segments. Pour into prepared pie crust, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to cool.   When pie filling has cooled to room temperature, preheat oven and prepare meringue. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large glass or metal bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and cream of tartar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Spread over pie, making sure the meringue completely covers the filling and meets the edges of the pie crust.   Bake in preheated oven until meringue topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Why don't you invent one?|`|s4WywJ8baa	Orange Custard Pie    Orange Meringue Pie    You just have to look.

zmlBcOTcaa	In terms of social infrastructure, it causes a strain on police force who have to arrest, prosecute the number of people who break laws while abusing alcohol--spousal abuse, drunk driving, etc.    Financially, people who abuse alcohol are far more likely to have health problems, meaning more trips to the hospital and doctor, which we as citizens pay more in health insurance premiums and taxes to help those who can't pay for health care.     It also affects society since alcoholics have children that grow up with the trauma of an alcoholic parent, and they are also more likely to suffer from alcoholism.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	STDs and lots of little kids, and violence|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	You should be creating your own answers for your homework ;-)    Try this one on for size...

One way to tell if you are getting enough water and  other liquids is by the color of your urine.  If you are  drinking enough, the color will be light yellow, almost clear.  The darker it is, chances are you need more water.

Clerks are there to help you, so ask for the manager or a clerk to walk around with you.    What you will find:    Frozen dinners already cooked - follow directions on the boxes, warm in microwave. Stick with the big name brands for good taste. Add a can of veggies or frozen veggies as a side dish.  Ask a clerk to show you where to find them.    Pre-cooked meats found in the cold section (just pop into the microwave for a few minutes) such as baked ham, pot roast, chops, chicken, meatloaf, and so much more. Ask a clerk to show you where to find them.    Canned vegetables to add as a side dish.  Canned sweet potatoes to add as a side dish.  Canned potatoes to add as a side dish.    Frozen vegetables in large bags or small boxes. Heat in microwave.  Ask a clerk to show you where to find them.    Fresh salad greens now come already cut up and in large packages. Buy the pre-washed types. All you have to do is add the salad dressing. Be sure to use by the date on the bag. Salads turn black and need to be thrown away if not used by the printed date on the bag.    Canned soups are delicious. Follow the directions on the cans.    Frozen desserts of all types. Follow directions on the containers.    Bake shop inside the grocery store has all kinds of desserts.    The deli has delicious rotisserie/roasted chickens. They also have all types of side dishes for you to choose from.    But if you would like to cook from scratch, go to:  http://www.cooks.com/rec/ch/main_dishes....  where there are lots of easy recipes. Put this website into your "Favorites". At the website, scroll down the screen and read some of the dinner recipes. On the left hand side you will find categories.    Buy a crock pot, read the directions...you put your dinner recipe in the crock pot, turn the knob to low most of the time, and it will be cooking while you are away from your home.     Here are 1,160 Crock Pot recipes:  http://www.cooks.com/rec/search?q=crock+...    Here are 2,600 Microwave recipes:  http://www.cooks.com/rec/search?q=microw...    There are jars of all types of sauces for all kinds of noodles. These are found on a shelf. Noodles are in packages, follow the directions...most of the time you will need a deep pan for boiling lots of hot water for the noodles.   A clerk can help you find these items.    You will find many brand named boxed dinners such as Pasta-Roni. There is a seasoned packet in each box.   (My favorite is Garlic & Olive Oil. I put more garlic powder in it 'cause I like to taste lots of garlic)  Ask a clerk if you need help in finding these boxed dinners.    Remember...safety in the kitchen at all times. Keep EVERYTHING clean!!!     Keep hot foods hot, and cold foods cold!!!    And "when in doubt, throw it out".  ****************************  1.

And I know what kind of cooler you are talking about, and those usually keep the beer between 40-45 Deg.

If I pour a glass, I always have another (unless it's the last glass!)|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	Hnmmm, sounds like self-control issues.  It's not the wine - it's you.  Now, do you finally stop at like, three, ten or 100?  If you drink every day until you fall over, you have a problem.  You may also have a problem if you cannot, or will not, stop at one glass.    I can stop at one glass any time and usually I do if it's during the week.  On the weekend, I will drink a little more, but stop usually at three or four.  And that's not every weekend, just night I feel like having a few.    EDIT - LOL - now that you've clarified...  (Geez do people ever read their questions before hitting submit???)  You are drinking it for the health benefits, but it's apparent that you also like the taste or it would be pretty easy to stop after one glass.  For the health benefits, two glasses will not hurt you per day (5oz each).  And, I also take a multi-vitamin with an anti-oxidant, drink grape juice for breakfast and also take fish oil capsules.  Or, any oil that contains Omega 3, 6 and possilby 9.  Combine that with exercise and you'll be a pretty healthy guy!|`|AA11447210	Alas, I cannot manage even one.

rWUV9iTRaa	Extra virgin olive oil should "first cold pressed".  Any oil that is processed with heat is oxidized and unhealthy.   First cold pressed oils are best used in their raw state.  Any oil brought to its smoking point becomes oxidized.  In other words, there is no such thing as healthy fried food.  When I saute vegetables like broccoli, escarole, brussel sprouts or broccoli rape, I use a small amount of olive oil, and prior to serving, I drizzle EVOO over the top.    If you like the flavor that olive oil gives to a certain dish then use it. If you don't want your oil to impart much flavor then canola is fine.|`|g2TWCLo5aa	olive oil|`|fpg7oicWaa	depends on the use.. pastas def olive oil,salad dressings both,frying use canola?|`|HsGj95jMaa	canola oil  http://cooking-service.synthasite.com/?q...|`|7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	I think that evoo is unnecessarily expensive and I don't particularly care for the taste so I always use canola.

Olive oil has a stronger flavor and good too.  Just be aware that it has a stronger flavor.    Extra Virgin olive oil is best for salad with a much stronger flavor.  Good for saute'ing, but for frying not as good since it tends to have a lower smoke point.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	Virgin olive oil for salads.  Olive oil for sauteing veggies.  I tend to use canola oil for baking and/or deep frying.|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	Olive oil is wonderful in salads and a quick saute.  It's lovely in dishes like green beans and garlic.     But Canola oil is best for frying and in baking.    You need to have both in your cupboard.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Depends on what you are using it for. You should keep both on hand. You can't use olive oil for frying because it has a low smoke point, but you can use it to sautee on medium heat. Also, you can't use olive oil for baking becasue of the strong flavor. However, olive oil tastes better in salad dressings, as a condiment, or for flavoring, and is healthier for you.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Virgin olive oil is the best.|`|EITcvAf2aa	Olive Oil is a more beneficial oil and tastes better.|`|mV8aV3CXaa	Lite extra virgin olive oil. Thats what I like.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Almost 80 percent of fat is monounsaturated, 9 percent is polyunsaturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain beta-carotene and Vitamin E.    Canola oil is same in calories, also has no cholesterol, but has less "good," monounsaturated fats. It contains some vitamin E, too.    A study conducted at the University of Dayton showed that frying with canola oil releases more toxic fumes into the air than frying with olive oil.    Another aspect is so called triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in the blood, which are responsible for the risk of heart disease. Research revealed that canola oil is better than olive oil: the after-meal levels of these lipoproteins were lower after consuming canola oil.    Canola oil increases excretion of cholesterol and bile acids, increases serum marker of bile acid synthesis, and decreases serum levels of cholesterol compared to olive oil (European J. Clinical Nutrition. 2005 Dec).|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Canola or peanut oil is better for frying.

vcgn6XZgaa	You can't - it would be too difficult. Just used creamed coconut from a pack.|`|9PRKiYZZaa	They are two different types.  Dessicated is little flakes and creamed is a big lump that sort of melts when you heat it.  You can't change one to the other without some complex process/processing plant!|`|1CVOHoapaa	Take it in your strongest hand and shake it really hard!|`|HsGj95jMaa	cream dessicated coco nut  http://cooking-service.synthasite.com/?q...|`|ALbWt2ylaa	The "Cream of Coconut" that you buy in the can at the store typically contains not only coconut, but sugar, water, preservatives, salt, and gums (to thicken it). To make a more natural "coconut cream" with your dessicated coconut, do this:    Place 2 cups of your desiccated coconut in a blender container and add 2 1/2 cups hot water. Cover and blend for about 30 seconds. Strain through a fine sieve or piece of muslin, squeezing out all the moisture. This will give you a 'thick' coconut milk. Allow this 'thick' coconut milk to stand for a while, and you'll notice a rich layer that rises to the top - THIS is your coconut cream. You may need to do this a few times (with fresh coconut each time) to get all the cream your recipe calls for.    Remember, though - THIS coconut cream is PURE and does not have all the added sweeteners, thickeners, and other ingredients/fillers that the grocery store cans have. So at this point, you'll want to remove the layer of cream from the top of your milk, place it in a saucepan over low heat and add some sugar to sweeten it. (I don't know how much - add a little, stir till it dissolves,  taste it, and add more if you think it needs it.)     Granted - the cans are easier to use, but if you're in a pinch and don't have them - and DO have dessicated coconut, some water, and a little time, it IS possible to make your coconut cream. Hey - it's better for ya, too!    (If you repeat the blending process using the same coconut and 2 1/2 cups more of hot water you will end up with a 'thin' coconut milk. When a recipe calls for 'coconut milk', mix your two 'pressings' together for a good quality 'coconut milk' that can be used in any recipe that calls for it.)

92eca444a459defcc652f7d1d95404bfaa	there are HEAPS of things you can do with it. i prefer the firmer tofu, but there are a few different types, the silken or soft one is good for different things. try looking in some vegetarian recipe books too.   i mainly like to cook tofu very basically - i dice into smallish cubes or strips, marinate in whatever you like (i like tamari -non-wheat, japanese, milder version of soy sauce- and finely sliced garlic and sometimes some sweet chili) then fry in a little oil in a pan. you can also add it to vegies in a stir fry.   my mum recommends boiling tofu before you eat it (just cut into cubes), as this is supposed to make it easier to digest so you may want to give that a go also. it pretty much doesn't have much of it's own flavour so you can do a lot with it! just use you imagination and use your favourite ingredients! the soft tofu is good for stuff like making dips or layering in lasange..  good luck and enjoy!!|`|6Gfz125Paa	You can fry it like meat.

The word "kefir" is derived from the Turkish word keif, which loosely translates to; good-feeling, feeling of well-being or feeling-good. Kefir is a refreshing probiotic cultured-milk beverage, which is believed to originate in the Northern Caucasus Mountains many centuries ago.  yogurt:A thick, custard-like, mildly acid preparation. Usually made by fermenting partly skim or skim milk with a special culture. Fruit of other flavorings may be added.

You'll find what coffee you like, then you can experiment with different brewing methods.|`|Eo4PngmAaa	get everybodys opinion on the best and worst coffee shops then get one coffee from each store and see how they taste!!!!|`|r8rykCkGaa	If it tastes bad, then I don't like it.

I find that I get the best results from rice that has been cooked and left to chill overnight. This recipe is the most basic, with optionals and notes added on ways to make it even more delicious    Ingredients          4 cups cold cooked rice        4 tablespoons soy sauce        1 clove garlic, minced (optional)        2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion        2 cups cooked and cubed chicken (optional)        2 cups cooked veggies (optional)        2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola    Directions       1. Heat a wok or large non-stick skillet over high heat.     2. When oil starts to "shimmer," turn the heat to medium-high.     3. If using garlic and/or green onions add to oil now and stir.     4. Add chicken and vegetables if using and mix well.     5. Quickly add rice and continue to stir until rice is separated and coated with oil or mixed evenly with chicken and veggies.     6. Sprinkle soy sauce over rice and stir until distributed well throughout rice.      Cheesy Chicken Taco Casserole  With only 6 ingredients and a short bake time, this dish works well for busy nights and is a hit with traditional taco lovers.   Ingredients          3 cups chopped, cooked chicken        1 package taco seasoning        2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar, divided        2 cups mild salsa        2 cups corn kernels        15 corn tortillas -- 6" size    Directions       1. Combine chicken and taco seasoning; toss to coat.     2. Mix chicken, salsa, corn and 2 cups of cheese together until well blended.     3. Cut 3 of the tortillas in half and layer 4 whole tortillas and 2 halves into the bottom of a greased 9x13 baking dish, making 5 tortillas total per layer. Spread half the chicken mixture over the tortillas and top with 5 more tortillas; 4 whole and 2 halves.     4. Layer with remaining chicken mixture and corn tortillas on the very top. Sprinkle with the last half cup of cheese and cover tightly with foil.     5. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 30 minutes.     6. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.  *Try a combination of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses instead of all cheddar.    If your family doesn't like corn, substitute equal parts drained black beans.    Black beans can also be used in place of the chicken for a vegetarian version.     Chicken and Spaghetti Parmesan  My kids like this next recipe so much that they've said, "Mom, dinner was really good. Can we have it again tomorrow night?" Now, that works for me!     Ingredients          1 lb spaghetti, or other pasta, cooked to desired doneness        1 24-ounce jar of your favorite pasta sauce        4-6 breaded chicken patties OR un-breaded, cooked chicken breasts (I do this more often than not)        1 cup grated mozzarella cheese        1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese    Directions       1. Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a lasagna dish or other rectangular baking pan with cooking spray.     2. Toss cooked pasta and 2/3 jar of sauce together and spread evenly into pan.     3. Sprinkle spaghetti with 1/2 cup of mozzarella.     4. Top with chicken patties. Pour remaining sauce over all and sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.     5. Cover with foil and bake for 20-30 minutes until heated through.     6. Serve each chicken patty with spaghetti underneath.    *It's important to add sauce to the pasta before placing the dish in the oven; plain pasta doesn't bake as well. My kids like this even without the chicken.    Pita Pizza  All you need is mozzarella cheese, sliced veggies, olive oil, pita pockets, and a grill. Brush the pita with oil, layer on the veggies and cheese, and then grill until the pita is crisp, the veggies are tender and the cheese is melted.  ingredients    1 pita bread round  1 teaspoon olive oil  3 tablespoons pizza sauce  1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  1/4 cup sliced crimini mushrooms  1/8 teaspoon garlic salt  Directions       1.

If Anaheim chiles cannot be found, add an additional poblano and jalape?o to the chili. This dish can also be successfully made by substituting chicken thighs for the chicken breasts. If using thighs, increase the cooking time in step 4 to about 40 minutes. Serve chili with sour cream, tortilla chips, and lime wedges.      Serves 6 to 8     3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves , trimmed of excess fat and skin    Table salt and ground black pepper    1 tablespoon vegetable oil    3 medium jalape?o chiles    3 poblano chiles (medium), stemmed, seeded, and cut into large pieces   3 Anaheim chile peppers (medium), stemmed, seeded, and cut into large pieces   2 medium onions , cut into large pieces (2 cups)     6 medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)   1 tablespoon ground cumin      1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander    2 (14.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans , drained and rinsed   3 cups low-sodium chicken broth      3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes)   1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves      4 scallions , white and light green parts sliced thin         See Illustrations Below: Building Flavor in White Chicken Chili    1. Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving until skin is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken and lightly brown on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate; remove and discard skin.     2. While chicken is browning, remove and discard ribs and seeds from 2 jalape?os; mince flesh. In food processor, process half of poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and onions until consistency of chunky salsa, ten to twelve 1-second pulses, scraping down sides of workbowl halfway through. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and onions; combine with first batch (do not wash food processor blade or workbowl).     3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from Dutch oven (adding additional vegetable oil if necessary) and reduce heat to medium. Add minced jalape?os, chile-onion mixture, garlic, cumin, coriander, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat.     4. Transfer 1 cup cooked vegetable mixture to now-empty food processor workbowl. Add 1 cup beans and 1 cup broth and process until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add vegetable-bean mixture, remaining 2 cups broth, and chicken breasts to Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until chicken registers 160 degrees (175 degrees if using thighs) on instant-read thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes (40 minutes if using thighs).    5. Using tongs, transfer chicken to large plate. Stir in remaining beans and continue to simmer, uncovered, until beans are heated through and chili has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.    6. Mince remaining jalape?o, reserving and mincing ribs and seeds (see note above), and set aside. When cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding bones. Stir shredded chicken, lime juice, cilantro, scallions, and remaining minced jalape?o (with seeds if desired) into chili and return to simmer. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve.             Step-by-Step: Building Flavor in White Chicken Chili          1. Brown Chicken: Brown the bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts before poaching them to achieve deep chicken flavor.       2. Saut Vegetables: To create a flavorful chile-centered base, saut the trio of chiles and onion along with the spices and garlic.     3. Puree Vegetables: To thicken the chili, process 1 cup each of the sauted chile mixture, beans, and broth in the food processor.      4. Stir in Fresh Chile: Add one minced raw jalape?o to the finished dish for a last-minute burst of chile flavor.       Step-by-Step: The Chosen Chiles          Jalape?os: This small, smooth-skinned, forest-green chile provides heat and a bitter, green bell pepper-like flavor.    Anaheim: This long, medium-green, mildly spicy chile has an acidic, lemony bitterness.     Poblano: This large, heart-shaped, blackish-green chile is mild to medium-hot and packs a rich, vegetal, slightly sweet flavor.     https://www.americastestkitchen.com/reci...  |`|CciXZNYraa	Fettuccini Carbonara !!!

YzXjppI6aa	INGREDIENTS  LADYFINGERS   5 eggs, separated   3/4 cup white sugar, divided   1 cup all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon vanilla extract   3/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting       SYRUP   1 cup white sugar   1 cup boiling water   1/2 cup strong brewed coffee   1/4 cup rum       FILLING   1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese   2 cups confectioners' sugar   1/4 cup dark rum   1 teaspoon vanilla extract   2 cups heavy cream       TOPPING   2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, grated   1/8 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting   DIRECTIONS  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.   In a medium bowl, whip egg yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar with an electric mixer until thick and pale. In a separate bowl, whip egg whites (with clean beaters) to soft peaks. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar while whipping to medium stiff peaks. Fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Gently fold in the flour and 1 teaspoon vanilla. The batter should be thick and pale yellow.   Trace two 9 inch circles onto the parchment paper using a cake pan as a guide. Spread or pipe batter to completely fill inside the lines of the circles. Batter should be about 1/2 inch tall.   Load the remaining batter into a pastry bag fitted with a half inch tip or hole. Draw parallel lines onto another piece of parchment that are 3 inches apart. Pipe the batter back and forth just between the lines in a compressed S motion, until you run out of batter. This is the part that wraps around the outside of the cake. (It helps to have it in one piece, but you can pipe individual fingers using the guidelines drawn on the paper, if you prefer.) There may be extra.   Bake in preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, until firm but not browned. Remove from the oven and dust generously with confectioners' sugar. Set aside to cool.   To make the syrup, stir together 1 cup sugar, boiling water, coffee and 1/4 cup rum until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.   To make the filling, combine mascarpone, 2 cups confectioners' sugar, dark rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl. Whisk together until completely smooth, scraping the bottom of the bowl to remove any lumps. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream. Whip with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Stop whipping when the mixture shows the first sign of graininess.   To assemble, line the sides of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment or waxed paper. Place one of the ladyfinger rounds in the bottom of the pan. Brush generously, but do not soak completely, with syrup. Place the 3-inch high ladyfinger strips around the inside edge of the pan, so that the sides are completely covered. Brush generously with syrup.   Spread half of the filling mixture over the first ladyfinger round in the pan. Place the remaining ladyfinger round on top of the filling. Soak the second ladyfinger round with syrup until it cannot take any more. Spread the remaining filling over that and smooth the top. Sprinkle with grated chocolate. Refrigerate at least 4 hours.   To serve, remove the sides of the pan and carefully remove the parchment or waxed paper from the outside of the cake. Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Easy Tiramisu    3 egg yolks   1/4 cup white sugar   2 teaspoons vanilla extract   1 1/8 cups mascarpone cheese   24 ladyfingers   1 1/2 cups brewed coffee   1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder     In a medium bowl, beat yolks with sugar and vanilla until smooth and light yellow.

BhFeii5Xaa	When you heat the beans, add a teaspoon of ginger to the beans. Otherwise, add two teaspoons of ginger to the whole pot. You cannot taste the ginger but it will cut the gas effect for most people.    Have a bottle of Beano to pass around the table as well just to make sure!|`|AA10466359	Leave out the beans, you don't have to have beans. But to me it's just not the same. There is a product called Beano you can get it in liquid which you add to the bowl of beans before you eat them or chewable tablet which you chew right before you eat them.   http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...  How much Beano? do I need to take?     The correct dosage amount is key to Beano's efficiency. Take one Beano? tablet or five drops of Beano? liquid per ? cup serving of gassy food. A typical meal consists of two or three servings of food, so a good rule of thumb is to take three Beano? tablets, or 15 Beano? drops, with each meal. For best results, you may have to adjust the number of tablets or drops according to the number of servings.     What is Beano??   Beano? contains a natural enzyme that helps prevent gas before it starts. Only Beano? contains a natural food enzyme that works with your body's digestion to break down the complex sugars in gassy foods, like fresh vegetables, whole grain breads and beans, making them more digestible. Beano? enables you to enjoy your favorite healthy foods, whether at home, in a restaurant or at a friend's house, without worrying about gas. Beano? is not a drug.   How does Beano? work?   Beano? contains an enzyme from a natural source that works with your body's digestion. It breaks down the complex sugars found in gassy foods into simpler, easily digestible sugars before they reach the colon, thereby preventing gas before it starts.   How much sodium is there in Beano??   Beano? tablets contain less than five milligrams of sodium per tablet. Therefore, it can be said that Beano? tablets are sodium-free. Beano? drops contain five milligrams of sodium per five drops.   Where can I buy Beano??   Beano? tablets and Beano? liquid drops are available in the antacid section of supermarkets, pharmacies, mass merchandising outlets and health food stores across the country. Beano? is also available in outlets like Sam's Club and Costco.   http://www.beanogas.com/BeanoFAQs.aspx|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Actually beans are what gives people gas in chili; not the peppers or spices. A little vinegar probably won't make much of a difference.     Use soft, easy-to-digest beans... or... better yet. Try sprinkling some Beano into the chili. It will neutralize the gas-causing enzymes in beans.    Personally, I always prefer beanless chili... but that would be chili con carne (not vegetarian).    Vegetarian chili would definitely require beans.|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	Leave out the beans for sure.  But, the other ingredients can still give you gas.  Take a Beano pill before you eat the chili.|`|N1wUHYKlaa	i like the answer with beano! that stuff does work!    BUT! i have heard that vinegar works also. i was told to add the vinegar at the beginning- and it doesn't take much- possibly less than 1/4 cup- a tablespoon or so.    what i've done with chili (i'm also vegetarian, so beans and such are a major source of protein for me!) is get the dried bagged beans. i'll boil them (with a little bit of vinegar in the water- like you'd add salt to boiling pasta to keep it from boiling over) til they are almost soft first, then drain them. and then i'll boil them again and drain. then add them into the recipe to the slow cooker.    boiling them and draining them afterwards helps get rid of some of the amino acids in them that cause the gas.    i know it may be late for this batch of chili- but good to try in the future!|`|lPZudPkUaa	Umm well it's a little late now. Normally you pre-soak the beans overnight (IN THE FRIDGE) and that will make them less, uh...dangerous.     For now, just go buy some Beano. I realize it's a product that lacks a certain "cool factor" but hey, it works.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Don't put vinegar OR Beano in your chili.  Leave out the beans, or learn to cope with the gas.  It'll go away in a day or so.  Beans are a complex carbohydrate that our stomach cannot break down in the amount of time they are in there.  The beans are passed along to the intestine, where they are attacked by microorganisms that excrete methane. That is where the gas comes from.  Vinegar will definitely taint the flavor of your chili, and Beano will...well, it won't help the taste, either.
R8bXuLbTaa	Spring and fall are best.     Cupcakes, brownies, bags of cookies, mini loves, cupcake cheesecakes. Try to keep it CHEAP!    I usually do them for phund raising at schools, cheerleading comps, sports games.    50-75 cents for small things up to 2.50  dollars MAX  for mini loaves or larger goods.     Dont know of a website. Maybe the Great American bake Sale?    I find them easy. Just gets alot of people involved and make sure you tell them it's for a good cause.    Yes.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	I think all seasons are good, but spring is the best. I have not been in charge of one but participated in several. I think individual items are easiest to sell. Cupcakes, muffins, rice krispie treats, giant cookies, mini banana bread loaves, brownies, etc.  Here is a website that gives all kinds of good advice.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	rice krispy bars fancied up with chocolate chips, walnuts, etc. You can offer hot cocoa or coffee when it is very cold, we had one at work one time and the day before we had a meeting, since it was forecast to snow the next day I suggested cocoa, and we made some money off cocoa and coffee. I dont think bake sales are all that easy, we had the advantage over the other departments because we set up a table by the doors on the first floor of dorm buildings, and the students would buy something before they went off to class. Rice crispy bars were a favorite, kind of nostalgic or something. Brownies do pretty good too. You can also offer non-sweet snacks like chex mix, or trail mixes too.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Anything will go.    You need to doing it for an organizatio or purpose rather than just spending money. I say that for a few reasons:    1. When you do it as a group or organiazation everyone brings in one or 2 things, and there is no basic cist for the items to the organization.    2. People are more willing to spend money on items (they really have gotten pricey for bake sales these days) if the money goes to a good cause other than just mall money.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Websites are About.com, Ehow.com, and Diylife.com.    Just type in " how to have a bake sale" in their search box.    Have fun :)|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Flapjacks and chocolate muffins - any time of year - always popular!    50p each.
AA11394457	Let's put it this way: is plain pasta nice?  Surely not!! Cous cous is nothing but tiny grains of semolina pasta, most people think they're a cereal like bulghur, but they aren't.  Sauce of any kind is too heavy for cous cous, you flavour it by adding spices and/or raw or cooked chopped vegetables. Can be eaten hot and can be eaten cold.|`|X4hz3a9haa	No, its bland and needs spice added to it, or tasty veg, its like eating pasta without the sauce.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	Add a little butter and salt and pepper. It's tasty.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	yum, it is plain. But enjoy.|`|VrjF986Aaa	yes it's very tastey|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I like it. I put a little butter in the water before I cook it and add some salt before I eat it.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	no, it's vile|`|6pksPo7Zaa	It's like plain boiled rice.  You really need to at least put a stock cube in.|`|3gHE7e2Haa	it is nice but a bit dry try to have it with sauce It is much better|`|HWojJn0qaa	Yeah, I think so. It has a really nice texture. If you want to make it extra tasty try adding some grilled vegetables and black olives.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	It is what you put with it that makes it  tasty|`|7Fv0Z3RZaa	its nice  really like it   much nicer if you cook it with a bit of butter and salt though!|`|sDKCX43caa	No it isn't, it is almost tasteless, but it is good at taking on flavours, so think of something robust that you like, or what else you are going to have.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	to have completely plain is rather bland. try added a little something to it.even something as simple as butter and garlic powder...or if you like spice cayanne pepper or crushed red pepper. celery flakes...    to make a good one     I have added, finely dinced onion, diced tomato, garlic, celary flakes and black pepper with a touch of butter....    even a bit of chicken is good. I used a little bit of that canned chicken with chopped up brocoli and garlic with butter as a secondary choice or you can add this to the one above....almost a meal in itself.|`|7pUPu7fMaa	It doesn't really taste of anything. At least flavour it with some herbs and seasoning.|`|G9MW776Gaa	no...tastes like carpet. put something else in it|`|dl8mNWaDaa	I still think it tastes good - but it's better with some seasoning.|`|d6349f62c822e9e2c0bbfe6dd63591b9aa	It's about as flavourful as plain white rice.  Try using a stock cube instead of just water.    If you're in a rush but need a bit more, throw in some chopped green onion or frozen peas (any frozen veggie goodness in your freezer), chopped nuts (pine nuts or almonds are best) and raisins.  mmmm|`|AA11312551	It's like rice; if you put butter on it, it tastes good.   So, consult some recipes...you'll see that usually there are additives to the dish.|`|FdvVSeAdaa	No, seriously, don't try it, it's bland and its a waste of lunch.|`|inMfHLWoaa	better with some salt and oil..and something like chopped up bacon or salad with it :)  x|`|4TWfpvA5aa	no it as actually not good at all.. u should cook it in some broth or flavor it with seasonings..

I6dcRgD6aa	Hi Dwight- I am not a vegan but I saw your question & I was told the more pulb or fiber is better so it isn't good to juice of blend|`|rVnTnuU1aa	I juice. Even the veggies, that i really dont like the taste of, i juice with others so that they taste better.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Both.......and sometimes both together....use vegetable juice as a base for blended soup.|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	If I had a juicer, I would totally juice. I really want a juicer.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	I have a juicer and I do juice...    I've fallen off the wagon a bit here lately, but I juice a LOT in the spring and summer months (fresh fruit abound!).|`|TufsEE2baa	both  Juicing helps break down the cellolose in things like carrots and beets. So you can get the nutients easier. The only other way to break down the cellolose in carrots is to cook them.   I juice greens like kale and wheat grass and I wouldn't want those things blended. Wheatgrass will give a hella tummy ache blended.     I blend things like melons, berries, oranges because I want the fiber as well as the nutrients.     Oranges loose too many nutrients juiced we need the pulp it has bioflavinoids.|`|302ffef29effe357880969d9892d2d5faa	Neither. I eat vegetables. And cheese. Lots of cheese. On everything.

But I do love my fruits and veggies, whole and untampered with.|`|2r4kfcJmaa	I blend because I don't have a juicer. I eat whole fruits and veggies most of the time, but when I want a smoothie I use my blender to make a yummy smoothie.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	Believe it or not, I actually started juicing when I stopped being vegan/vegetarian.  The reason I started juicing was because I went to an alternative doctor who told me to do that.  He also told me to start eating meat.  I did and my health improved.    I still miss being vegan though.  But I felt like I had no choice.  I was really sick.  Although I think being Vegan can be healthy for some people though.    I started blending much later... So I guess my answer is neither.  I did not juice or blend when I was vegan/vegetarian.

nbChnDIBaa	Yes.  Butter is an amazing product. Other than the fact that dust and other free floating air particles may stick to it. The harmful stuff such as bacteria have a difficult time feeding off of it.  It would take a lot longer for it to putrefy or spoil......So spread away!    If it's soft, just cool it down in the fridge.   If it's too runny, dip your bread in it.  If it moves......kill it!|`|AA10236979	I don't keep mine in the fridge. That way, it's always ready to be spread!|`|ADP9swbMaa	Of course. I usually store butter on the counter in a butter platter. It's much easier to spread that way.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	I'm very surprised at the answers already given to your question, reason being, any butter I leave out by neglect, forgetting to put it back in the fridge seems to taste changed. Not fresh. Even if I then cook with it, not eating it on bread or over vegetables, will give the food a spoiled taste. As if it has gone past its' point of tolerating having been left out of refrigeration. I know am confused, since this is against what others have answered. Perhaps it's the butter I'm using. Don't know!|`|ylJoUuMDaa	Butter does not have to be refrigerated.|`|GIqACtxvaa	Butter does not have to be refrigerated.  Ours is always left out  on the counter at room temperature.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Shiela, not only edible, but spreadable as well....    Chris|`|MRDJu8v3aa	I grew up on a dairy farm where we used the milk to make butter. Since we had no electricity (interior of Brazil), we had to buy ice to keep the coolers cold. But when we took the butter to the city, we never kept it cold. It stays good for a very long time outside of the refrigerator.|`|1CJggYYLaa	If it is real butter, it doesn't have to be refrigerated.  I leave a stick out (covered, of course) to use to spread on bread, toast, or muffins.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Edible? Yes.    Gross? Also yes.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Yes. Most people are unaware that butter does not need to be refrigerated at all. It is stable at room temperature. Some people actually store it by the stick in the pantry or on the counter top, rather than in the refrigerator.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	It is not only edible it is spreadable on breads!! I never put mine back in the fridge after unwrapping it and putting it in the butter bowl! Unless that is, I am going to be gone for a week!
uOHf7rSlaa	Check out the source listed.  It's a great site that has healthy vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes that don't trade healthy for tasty.    There's a complete section of all vegetarian dishes.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Do you eat chicken and cheese?    This is very yummy and what we are having.    Creamy white chicken lasagna:    15 whole artichoke hearts(canned)  3 tbp olive oil  4 cloves garlic chopped super small  1/2 cup pine nuts  1-15 oz container ricotta cheese  1 egg  1 cup finely shredded parmesan  1/2 tsp salt  1/4 cup flour  1 cup chicken or veggie stock  2 cups half and half (or even evaporated milkl)  1 cup shredded mozzerella cheese  9 lasgana noodels cooked (or you can use the "ready bake")  3-4 boneless skinless boneless chicken breasts  1/2 stick butter      Cut artichokes in 1/2 and then either boil teh chicken, drian-cool-and shredd or if you have a grill then put it on the grill and then cut into bite sized pieces.    In a sauce pan put 2 tbsp of the oil and add the garlic, pine nuts, and artichokes. Saute iuntil the artichokes get a bit more tender, and the pine nuts start to toast, but be careful to Not burn the pine nuts and garlic. Drain and tranfer to a large bowl.    Stir in the ricotta, egg and chicken, 1/2 cup parmesan, and     Melt the butter and remaining oil in a pan and sprinkle in the flour, let the butter and flour bubble for 2-3 min. Slowly add the cream and broth. Adding alternatly, and letting it thicken slightly between each addition.    In a small bowl mix remaining parm with the mozzerella.    Pour approx 3/4 cup of the white sauce in the bottoom of a 9x13 casserole dish. Lay down one ;ayer or fnnodles and then add 1/3 of the chicken mix, white sauce, and about 1/4 of the cheeses.    Repeat ending up with about 1/2 the cheese mix on top so it is extra cheese on top.    Bake at 350 uncovered for 35-40 min. Or until hot and bubbly.    Serve with a nice salad-you could even do the pre-mixed baggies from the market, and a frozen loaf of garlic bread.      Serve with heart chaped garlic bread (use a large cookie cutter for the shape) and a nice dinner salad with a lot of red veggies:    beets, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes, sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese (I know it's not red but red and white work) etc....    You could even make the radishes into little roses to serve on top of the salad. Use either a raspberry vin, or a creamy white ranch or blue cheese dressing to go with all the red and tie in.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Spinach Lasagna    1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil   2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach   1/2 onion, chopped   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano   1/2 teaspoon dried basil   2 cloves garlic, crushed   1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce   1 1/2 cups water   2 cups non-fat cottage cheese   1 (8 ounce) package part skim mozzarella cheese, shredded   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese   1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley   1 teaspoon salt   1/8 teaspoon black pepper   1 egg   8 ounces lasagna noodles       DIRECTIONS  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Serve small portions of cake made with fat less cocoa sponge alternately layered with cherry compote and whipped cream. Keep cake and other layers thin so it's not too rich. Offer thin cream or thin chocolate sauce to accompany it. Don't over sweeten anything keep quantities of cherries and cream quite low so your guests don't get uncomfortable tummies. I know you said no fruit but small amount of  cherry compote balanced out with unsweetened whipped cream and light chocolate sponge (small portions, though) I don't think will be too acidic|`|uS07WAwcaa	You could do chocolate fondue and dip strawberries into it.

Well I'm not your mommy so in that case....By the time they all get hammered (or pissed in British terms), they will all be acting like a bunch of idiots, so just go along with it and act stupid with them.

BWxSSADaaa	-Tempura (basically, deep fried shrimp or veggies, but in a light batter)  -Fried rice/noodles  -Smoked Salmon roll (usually has smoked salmon, cream cheese, surprisingly it's not bad)  -Unagi (barbequed eel sushi.  I know, maybe you think eel sounds gross, but just try it.  It's surprisingly suited to an American palate, with that tasty sauce!)  -Yakitori (barbequed kabobs, the ones I've seen the most often are pieces of chicken breast, or little meatballs.  I love the meatballs, they're really great!)  -Teriyaki (I think it's already been explained ...)  -If you like the taste of avocado, get some avocado rolls.  I love the taste of rich, buttery avocado, so I like these.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Teriyaki is always safe for a palate that isn't used to Japanese food.|`|OEX7V9RFaa	You could go to a Japanese restaurant and order something that sounds familiar and stick to with what you know, you know beef then order beef dishes.  Or you could walk into an Asian market and buy a few sweets and 'on the go' food and try them out.    You could also start with the simple flavors, sweet & sour, teriyaki, and soy sauce and just add them to food you already love. I don't think you should jump into sushi right away because you might get sick from the raw fish, unless your eating veggie sushi.     Seaweed is also a great place to start as well. I love seaweed it has a nice leafy taste to it, a bit slimy when it's in salad form but very tasty as nori (used for sushi and rice balls) or as a lighty crispy snack on the go.    Rice balls are also a sure hit because it's really just regular rice with a bit of nori on it. It's not hard to make (look up a recipe if you want to try it I just made some last week) and you can seaon to taste with salt or soy sauce.    Hope I helped!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	I agree with CorpCity's answer, teriyaki, but let's take it a step further.    Most Japanese restaurants serve a traditional dinner called a Bento or Bento Box. The bento is a compartmentalized box with various different foods, sides, appetizers and sauces throughout. It is the PERFECT way to get acclimated with Japanese food as it gives you a sampling of some of the more transitional foods... just like you're looking for!    Most bento's have the following:    -White rice  -A dumpling appetizer; like gyoza. Usually a potato dumpling, or it could be filled with pork.  -Tempura shrimp/vegetable; temuro is a light, flaky breading on fried shrimp and vegetables. It comes with a light dipping sauce. Very popular and delicious.  -California Rolls; these are sushi "training wheels" if you will, or an Americanized version... the California roll contains no raw fish. It is cucumber, avacado and crab meat in a sushi roll. Try it dipped in the wasabi and soy sauce.   -Teriyaki protein; you can usually get salmon, shrimp, beef or chicken. Delicious.
mfXDUkRYaa	I chose to stop eating meat aged nine. It's never too late. As for tastes, I was a really picky eater before I became vegetarian but now I'm older and vegan I'm not that fussy at all.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Meat is essential to a growing child's diet, chicken is an excellent source of protein for her.|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	No it's not to late. The fact that you feed her healthy vegetarian food means that she has seen you doing that since she was born. You are setting a good example for her. When you are fully moved out you can be sure that she isn't eating any junk food.    BTW to those who say that a child needs meat: first of all that's not true. IF it was true, then chicken nuggets would not be they way to go anyways. If you insist on feeding meat to your children at least don't give them deep fried food and soft drinks!|`|vcgn6XZgaa	It is never too late to break bad habits - go for it!|`|A5gfxSyzaa	It's a little worrisome how uninformed some people are.  Meat IS NOT necessary for a child's development and you are doing a great thing by trying to get her away from junk food.    It's never too late.  The whole "age 5" thing is more to do with temperment and character traits, not eating habits.  You shouldn't have a problem.    Edit: Fat is important to a child's brain development.  The fat does not have to be animal fat, though.  I can come from olive oil, avadados, nuts, etc.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	No....most childrens eating habits change several times throughout childhood....they aren't fixed by 5.  5 year olds are often picky eaters, and grow up to like everything eventually.  I think taste is more part of physical development than psychological, so its not a question of personality.  I loved some things when I was a toddler, and loathed them by 5.  I disliked somethings when I was 6 and hate them now......if she ever longs for chicken nuggets in the future you could tell her they were vegetarian chicken nuggets.  I could never tell the difference between real ones and fake by Realeat.|`|9c0JAYP9aa	The soda is bad, the meat is good (chicken nuggets don't really count).    Meat and animal fats are an important part of the human diet and have been for millions of years (i.e. since the days of homo erectus). By all means minimize your child's intake of sugar, processed flour and artificial foods and increase her intake of fruits, veggies, and unprocessed meats. At the very least make sure she eats eggs and dairy. They are good for growing kids and the animals fats are essential for proper brain development.|`|3SY0ObRQaa	nooo of course not!  i went vegan two years ago.

The bartender will then ask you your preference of vodka.|`|mxEzagl7aa	Well the first thing to do in a situation like this would be to either sit at the bar (if possible) or at least order your drink at the bar.  Either way, try to order from the bartender and get in the habit of doing this, regardless of whether or not you have a special order.  This is a tip from cocktail enthusiasts that works for situations like this one.  Ordering directly from the bartender allows you to tell him or her exactly how you want the drink to be made and whether or not you want anything special (more olives, a particular type of vodka, a different garnish, etc.).  Ordering directly at the bar gives you a better chance of getting the drink that you want the first time, without having to go through a server or the table staff, where special orders can get lost or confused.    As for your actual order, just order a dirty martini with extra olive juice.  Dirty martinis are commonplace enough and simple enough that many bars will make you one even if it isnt technically on the drink list/menu.          Simply ordering a martini with extra olive juice might be confusing, as a traditional martini is simply gin or vodka along with a varying amount of dry vermouth.  The dirty martini adds olive juice or substitutes it for the dry vermouth, depending on the particular recipe.

Chris|`|lFqUMMAGaa	I had duck breast on Sunday I had mashed potato Broccoli and orange gravy with it it was really nice :-)|`|AA10698792	One very common accompaniment for duck is wild rice pilaf.  A simple way to make it is to cook 3 parts white or brown rice in stock (any stock you like), set it aside and then cook 1 part wild rice separately (it takes longer to cook than regular rice).    During this cooking saute some minced shallots, garlic, celery and carrots until they're softened and translucent and then mix all the ingredients together in the last 2 minutes of cooking to bring everything back to temperature.    The sauce I usually make for duck has cherries in it, but you could just as easily make the same sauce without them to keep the sweetness down.    Finely mince 1 teaspoon of fresh rosemary (or use 1/2 teaspoon of dried ground), and saute in a bit of oil or some of the fat from the duck(your choice) with 4 teaspoons of minced shallots (white or yellow onion will suffice) with a light sprinkling of salt until translucent.  Add half a cup of stock and any duck juices and half a cup of balsamic vinegar and simmer until reduced (it's ready when it coats the back of a soup spoon). (I use the cheap balsamic for this...the expensive kind gets very sweet during the reduction stage).    Chop about a tablespoon of fresh tarragon or fresh thyme and add at the last minute or so of cooking and serve with the duck.    You may want to add just a few dried cherries or cranberries, not so much to give the sauce a fruit taste but to balance out the flavour.|`|Jph6y9viaa	tamales|`|7xkwE3X9aa	nothing.  duck breast, eww.|`|qQx48XZuaa	chicken|`|d1372da2f003c93deb4aa8328efee51eaa	Wild rice.  it is what everyone has with duck.  probably because that is what the duck was eating or something.|`|Wch2WybQaa	Duck bras?|`|9F76AUgfaa	shame hubbie doesn't like fruity sauces because Delia's Bitter Orange Sauce for duck is lovely-have seen a recipe for duck and puy lentils somewhere,will try and find it.|`|fZnuyKSZaa	a wonderful addition to puy lentils ( which work beautifully with duck) is a swirl of balsamic glaze ( or syrup) which you will find in most supermarkets.

AA10466359	Watch this little how to video link here.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWtuHGg0H...  Here is a short video how to do it. This chef used wine and vinegar, honey but beef broth is milder. Even better would be a cup of leftover strong coffee or coco-cola. That would be a deeper richer flavor than the beef broth! There are many variations, you should try the coffee or beef broth first.  You can do this in other recipes with cognac, beer, bourbon.   Yes it's easy, she simply deglazed the skillet with red wine after the steaks were cooked. Any red wine will work don't go buy an expensive bottle.  When steaks are done, remove, then pour a good cup or more of wine in the pan and scrape the bottom of the pan to get the brown goodness( wine will not flame up but other alcohols will) then add 1/2 cup of water and a bullion cube or 1/2 beef broth which ever you have,    Then simmer and reduce to about half now finally add a spoon of margarine and serve.. Thats it!..  Use this technique for all your dishes. That is what I do with steak, chciken breast, pork chops that I pan grill. I either make mashed potatoes, rice or even baked potato and put the yummy sauce over it. Now I must have it!!!!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Not very helpful description.

ZaMzRSrraa	Nutritional Benefits of Honey   Honeys Nutritional Profile    Raw honey is a source of simple carbohydrates. Its composition on average, is 17.1 percent water, 82.4 percent total carbohydrate and 0.5 percent proteins, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. The average carbohydrate content is mainly fructose (38.5 percent) and glucose (31 percent). The remaining 12.9 percent of carbohydrates is made up of maltose, sucrose and other sugars.        Source of Energy    As a carbohydrate, raw honey supplies energy at 64 calories per tablespoon, providing fuel to working muscles. A limited study at the University of Memphis Exercise and Sports Nutrition Laboratory found raw honey to be one of the most effective forms of carbohydrate gels to ingest just prior to exercise. According to Dr. Richard Kreider, the studys lead investigator, honey appears to be a carbohydrate source that is relatively mild on its effects upon blood sugar compared to other carbohydrate sources. Continuing research is examining the effects of raw honey in comparison to different types of carbohydrate gels prior to weightlifting on the effect on glucose, insulin and markers of protein breakdown.    Other limited studies performed in Dr. Kreiders lab have shown that raw honey may comprise half of the secret to post-workout recuperation. Many post-workout products on the market combine a large amount of carbohydrates with protein. The most common carbohydrate source used is maltodextrin, a mildly sweet carbohydrate usually derived from corn. Upon comparison of a honey-protein vs. a maltodextrin-protein shake taken after a vigorous weightlifting workout, the honey-protein combination fared as well in promoting markers of muscle recuperation. The honey groups blood sugar was sustained for at least two hours post-workout. Our data suggest that honey functions well in all of the aspects associated with post-workout recuperation and energy repletion. In addition, raw honey appears to stand out as perhaps a better source of carbohydrate to ingest with post-workout protein supplements. These findings support our previous study presented at the annual Experimental Biology meeting in April 2000, added Dr. Kreider.    In addition to promoting muscle recuperation and glycogen [carbohydrates stored in muscle] restoration, honey-protein combinations also seem well suited to sustain favorable blood sugar concentrations after training.    Honeys Nutrition and Health Facts  Vitamins, Minerals and Amino Acids in Every Bite    Raw honey contains small amounts of a wide array of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and antioxidants. The vitamins found in honey may include (depending on floral variety) niacin, riboflavin and pantothenic acid; minerals present include calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. Just as the color and flavor of honey varies by floral source, so does the vitamin, mineral, antioxidant and amino acid content.    Antioxidants in Honey    In addition to the nutrients that are involved in normal metabolic activity, foods contain components that may provide additional health benefits. These nutrients are referred to as nutraceuticals. Phytochemicals are one broad category of nutraceuticals found in plants that are actively being investigated by scientists for their health-promoting potential. Honey has a phytochemical profile which includes polyphenols that can act as antioxidants.    Antioxidants perform the role of eliminating free radicals, which are reactive compounds in the body. Free radicals are created through the normal process of metabolism and contribute to many serious diseases. Researchers at the University of Illinois, led by Nicki J. Engeseth, Ph.D. and May R. Berenbaum, Ph.D., are studying the antioxidant capacity of common honey varieties.    Honeys Antimicrobial Properties and Benefits to Wound Healing    The use of honey as a wound dressing goes back to ancient times and has now been rediscovered by modern medicine, according to Dr. Peter Molan of the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It is a common observation in the many reports in medical journals that numerous benefits result from using honey to dress wounds, says Dr. Molan. The antibacterial properties of honey may help clear infection in wounds, and the anti-inflammatory action of honey may reduce pain and may improve circulation which hastens the healing process. According to Dr. Molan, Honey stimulates the re-growth of tissue involved in healing, making healing faster and reducing scarring.       www.champlainvalleyhoney.com|`|RGx530AUaa	I can't compete with the amount of information in Mama Mia's answer, but I do know one interesting fact about honey:     Honey is the only food that never spoils.|`|doL0RZN8aa	ALL KINDS F THINGS I HEAR AND IT IS SWEET TOO.....|`|vcgn6XZgaa	It is a natural product, is versatile and has a good flavour.

9CKrP9Keaa	Steaming rice is a misnomer. Measure 1 cup of rice and place it in a small saucepan. Pour in enough water until it's 1/2 inch higher than the rice. Bring to boil, turn down heat until it's a very slow simmer. Cover and set your timer for 20 minutes. Important, DO NOT PEEK. When your timer goes off turn off the heat, remove the cover and fluff with a fork.   Tip: If you want really great rice go to an Asian store and buy Korean rice. It is grown in the US and is Japanese style rice. Koreans call it Korean rice, it's the same as Japanese. Guaranteed you will never go back to Carolina or any other brand.

zawmsUO1aa	Additions to consider include crumbled crispy bacon, dried fruit, shredded coconut, chocolate, peanut butter, and instant espresso powder. And when your favorite fruit or berry is out of season, frozen versions do just as well when thawed and thoroughly drained (watery fruit will thin batter).    Stir mashed banana, chopped nuts, peanut butter, pumpkin puree, grated apples, and the like into the batter so whatever you add flavors every bite.    Sprinkle sliced banana or berries (halved or whole, depending on size) directly onto the batter right after you've poured it onto the griddle or waffle iron so the fruit remains intact and evenly distributed.        FLAVORED BUTTERS  When butter plays a starring role, opt for the best-quality sweet (not salted) butter you can find. Or make flavored butter. After mixing, roll in parchment paper to form a log.

AA12336927	Stouffer's Macaroni & Cheese    By Todd Wilbur    What is it about Stouffer's Macaroni & Cheese that makes it the number one choice for true mac & cheese maniacs? It's probably the simple recipe that includes wholesome ingredients like skim milk and real cheddar cheese, without any preservatives or unpronounceable chemicals in there. This basic formula is good news for kitchen cloners who want an easy fix that doesn't require much shopping. I found the recipe to work best as an exact duplicate of the actual product: A frozen dish that you heat up later in the oven. This way you'll get slightly browned macaroni & cheese that looks like it posed for the nicely lit photo on the Stouffer's box. Since you'll only need about 3/4 cup of uncooked elbow macaroni for each recipe, you can make several 4-person servings with just one 16-ounce box of macaroni, and then keep them all in the freezer until the days when your troops assemble for their mac attacks. Be sure to use freshly shredded cheddar cheese here since it melts much better than pre-shredded cheese (and it's cheaped). And use a whisk to stir the sauce often as it thickens, so that you get a smooth -- not lumpy or grainy -- finished product. If you feel like classing up this comfort food clone, serve it in your nicest casserole dish and tell everyone it's "pasta formaggio."    1 cup skim milk  5 teaspoons all-purpose flour  2 cups (6 ounces) shredded medium cheddar cheese  2 teaspoons margarine  1/4 teaspoon plus  1/8 teaspoon salt  1 3/4 cups cooked elbow macaroni (about 3/4 cup uncooked)    1. Whisk flour into skim milk in a small saucepan, then place it over mediumllow heat.    2. Add shredded cheddar cheese, margarine and salt and stir often with a spoon until the cheese begins to melt. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Use a whisk to stir the sauce every couple of minutes so that it becomes smooth and thick.    3. While sauce thickens, prepare macaroni by dumping 3/4 of a cup of uncooked elbow macaroni into rapidly boiling water. Boil for 8 minutes or until tender, and then strain. You should. have at least 1 3/4 cups of cooked macaronI.    4. When cheese sauce has simmered for 30 minutes, pour pasta into a medium bowl. Gently stir in cheese sauce, and then pour mixture into a loaf pan or casserole dish. Cover and freeze.    5. When you are ready to scarf out on your macaroni & cheese, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake frozen macaroni for 50 to 53 minutes or until the cheese begins to brown slightly.    Serves 4.    Tidbits: While I prefer the oven method of heating up the macaroni & cheese (since it adds a bit of browning and a slightly crunchy texture), you can also use your microwave oven to prepare the dish in a fraction of the time. Just be sure you freeze the macaroni & cheese in a microwave-safe casserole dish following the recipe above. When you are ready to heat up the frozen cheesy goodness, simply cook it uncovered on high for 8 minutes, and then stir. Continue cooking on high fo 2 to 3 more minutes or until the macaroni & cheese is hot.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Ingredients  1 cup skim milk   5 teaspoons all-purpose flour   2 cups shredded medium cheddar   2 teaspoons margarine   1/4 teaspoon salt   1/8 teaspoon salt   1 3/4 cups cooked macaroni (about 3/4 c. uncooked)   Directions  1.  Whisk flour into skim milk is a small saucepan.   2.  Place it over medium low heat.   3.  Added shredded cheddar cheese, margarine and salt.   4.

qNbHazO6aa	Personally, I think that if your head cook has been trained to make authentic Italian food from a legitimate source or school, it doesn't matter what their ethnicity is. Some people may be stuck-up and think that it does matter, but not all Italian people can automatically make amazing Italian food just because of their nationality. When I hear "authentic ____ cuisine", I think I would be thinking more about the food being authentic than the person making it, unless you change to something that says "authentic ____ cuisine made by an authentic _____ person," which is... kind of silly.|`|Lahpeewyaa	I'm not in the restaurant business, I am still in college, I don't think it is necessary to have an Italian cook. If you are really going for the "authentic" Italian cuisine it would be beneficial to have an Italian cook, or someone with a lot of experience in that category. If the head cook that you already have is that amazing, I would stick with it and see how it goes. I think when you go into a restaurant that's goal is to be authentic, the real question of authenticity is the restaurants atmosphere and the feeling that it gives you of the region.    Right now I am a business major and once I get that degree I am planning on going to culinary school. My dream is to own a successful catering/event planning business and one day I would love to own a restaurant. I wish you the best of luck and success!!!|`|Eb3SnljMaa	well i would say as long as your chef/cook is well trained in cooking italian dishes ( since you are promoting an italian restaurant) i would think that should be suitable enough....not necessary to be italian themself. i know in the italian restaurnant i was in, the main chef himself was not of italian decent BUT he was an amazingly good italian chef, i learned much from him almost as much as i learned from my italian grandmother and great grandmother who came from italy.    goood luck in your venture.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Rosieolg, not only would it be a good idea, that your chef was Italian, but you also must decide on the cuisine, if your going Northern Region or Calabrian/Sicilian. there may be some dishes you might not like yourself, but as a blackboard/whiteboard special, can be a real draw card. Things like, Tripe, Rabbit, Porchetta, Quails. Then you have the seafood lines, like sardines, baby octopus, whole calamari, muscles.    Then location, location, location, do you have a strong Italian community where your looking at opening. Good chef and good food, more business and less wastage.    Hope this was of help.

That would make the difference as to what to add to it to make it taste better.  obviously, they think it tastes just fine so it really comes down to personal taste.  If you do not like meat and beans and tomato base with lots of spices, you are pretty much out of luck with adding anything else to make it taste different as that is what chili is.  Now if your mom is making a horrible bland chili, you can boost flavor with lots of things like more chili powder or red peppers.

Ingredients  3/4  cup sesame seeds  4  tuna steaks , 8 ounces each and about 1 inch thick  2  tablespoons vegetable oil   Table salt and ground black pepper  Instructions          1. Spread sesame seeds in shallow baking dish or pie plate. Pat tuna steaks dry with paper towel; use 1 tablespoon oil to rub both sides of steaks, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Press both sides of each steak in sesame seeds to coat.          2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just beginning to smoke; swirl to coat pan. Add tuna steaks and cook 30 seconds without moving steaks. Reduce heat to medium-high; continue to cook until seeds are golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully flip tuna steaks; cook, without moving steaks, until golden brown on second side, about 1 1/2 minutes for rare (opaque at perimeters and translucent red and cool at center when checked with tip of paring knife) or 3 minutes for medium-rare (opaque at perimeters and reddish pink at center). To serve, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Serve with sauce or salsa, if desired.
ewUQuX4Kaa	Beer that is in clear or green glass is more likely to "skunk"    When UV light penetrates glass bottles, it causes riboflavin to interact with and degrade isohumulones from the hops in beer. The result is a chemical called methyl mercaptan, which is one of the chemicals in a skunk's spray.  Green and clear glass protect against only about 5% ov UV light.  Brown glass protects against about 98% of UV light.  Cans and kegs offer 100% protection.    Cheers!|`|ku7s4H83aa	Because sin lives in the dark. Only that which is good would be in the light and chose to be.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	It doesn't always.  Corona comes in clear bottles.|`|zGKmgwofaa	It helps keep the taste smooth. If exposed to too much light, the beer will go bad.|`|ra69rxxgaa	Because beer looks like piss, and no one likes drinking piss. Except this one guy i know.|`|8lzBktaeaa	b/c the look of beer isnt the most appealing.  I think you meant Beer bottles...|`|q2AsDnjpaa	light destorys the active ingredients and makes it go bad.

Its not so bad. I have done it many times when I didnt have milk in the house. If cocoa is what you want, then you will be satisfied !!|`|HigxGZbYaa	If you're using an instant mix that calls for hot water, then yes.    If the instant mix calls for hot milk and you use water, then it will be too watery and not creamy.    It's easy to make your own hot cocoa mix that can be prepared with water. Look online for recipes that include dry milk powder-- When water is added, it makes its own milk right in the cocoa!    If using regular milk is an issue (because of lactose intolerance, for example) you can prepare a store-bought instant mix using  soy milk or rice milk instead of cow's milk. Just make sure that the mix you're using doesn't already contain what you're trying to avoid.|`|qPfQM0p3aa	yes, but it would be bland.|`|01pBf4vhaa	Yea My mothers Lactose Intolerant so she can't have milk but she put water in her Cocoa itstead I personally perfer milk....^.^

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and have worked in the Caribbean mostly Jamaica, and split peas will cook fine unsoaked, just make sure to stir the pot, as they cook they tend to sink to the bottom of the pot and can scorch if not watched carefully, here in Toronto Canada we have many West Indian people and I tend to use the curry powders blended for Trini and Jamaican palate, less cumin, more allspice, mustard powder and turmeric, as for heat, that is your call, for me I like it fiery for dhal and doubles with channa dal in them so I use hot pepper sauce in the nd or scotch bonnet peppers in the beginning, seeds out if your not into something flaming.    If you cannot find roti skins in your area, I often use tortillas for it, a decent substitute.

4xzsPfVzaa	Yes, cake flour.

There is a brand called Swans Down in a red box and can be found on the baking aisle.|`|ylJoUuMDaa	My Mom used to use Swans Down Cake Flour but that's kind of old fashioned now and todays recipes just use all purpose flour unless otherwise stated.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Yes, there is a special flour made by Swan and labelled cake flour.  However, I have never used it to make cakes.  It is expensive and unless your recipe specifically calls for it, don't bother.    You can use regular flour (not self-rising) and add baking powder to it (as per the recipe).    I prefer that to self-rising but you can use that too.    It all depends on the recipe.|`|dhi9LyJ5aa	Regular Flour|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Cake flour is finer milled than all purpose flour. You can use all purpose, but get a finer texture in your cakes if you use cake flour.    One brand name is Swansdown, that is the one most available in any baking aisle in any grocery store. I think King Arthur Mills makes a cake flour as well, but I don't have access to King Arthur flours.    Cake flour is NOT old fashioned, nor does it have baking powder or any other additive in it. It is NOT a self rising flour.
6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Wine is largely priced based upon the rarity of the wine.    There are normally less than 25,000 cases produced of Opus One each year.      You will find that most ultra expensive wines have only marginally better ratings than wines at 1/10 their cost.    Take a great wine maker that makes a very good wine and keep production very low and you have the makings of a very expensive wine.     Rich people like to drink wine that not everybody has access to    If you think Opus One is expensive, how do you justify a bottle of 2005 Chateau Petrus for $2500?

Then set the burner to medium heat, or if your burners heat up extra hot, you should set it to medium-low.  Pancake mix (like Bisquick or Krusteaz)  Milk or water (milk works better)  Mix them based on proportions stated on the box.  Then mix in anything you might want in the batter, like blueberries or semi-sweet chocolate chips. Or just leave them plain.  Pour batter into heated pan, as much or as little as you want for the size of the pancakes.  Get a sturdy spatula, and after a couple minutes check the bottom side of the pancake by kind of slowly lifting up the edge of it with the spatula. When that side looks a nice golden color, slide spatula all the way under and quickly flip it over in pan, letting the other side cook.  Check it by sticking in a toothpick or fork, if it comes out dry then the inside of the pancake is cooked.

nWA0AaXtaa	in some urban places eg: new york, tap water is dirty(particles) and only fit for washing. but in some mountained areas, tap water is pureand is fit for drinking. so if u live in an urban area, buy bottled water. if u don't want to waste money, pure water also usually comes in big bottles (15 inches) and u have to insert a pump into it. them u can pump out the water. or simply buy a machine with a knob. when u turn the knob, water flows automatically. it very cheap. that also uses the big bottled water. hope that helped. ^.~-?!!!|`|AA11402528	ew yuck.  i use the one outta my fridge door|`|fv2GAAdPaa	yeah only from home though cuz mine is purified...straight from the tap. =]|`|E3yOmel9aa	tap water is fine, if you are worried buy a filter|`|355e7824f276b6c691ef34823338dea3aa	yes its cheap and theres nothing wrong with it, i wouldn't pay for bottled water, apart from savage waste of plastic on their bottles, i hate to pay for something i already pay for in my water bill|`|uurgL3oZaa	Yup, 'cause have you ever seen where bottled water companies get their water?

wJxlsKWxaa	They should feed their cat or dog normal cat/dog food.     Trying to force your pet to follow a vegetarian diet is cruel as the animals need specific vitamins, minerals etc. which come from it. Also cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies aren't supposed to process food other than meat [this is what my vet says]. Most vegetarians/vegans accept the fact that their pets NEED the meat, and believe that it is natural for these hunters to consume it even when domesticated.    If someone is against killing animals so much that they are not willing to let their pets have meat, they should not have a carnivorous pet in the first place!|`|0hdo4WORaa	Makes no sense, if we don't feed them they die, that would be killing them.    I know you mean "why do we feed them meat" but you didn't ask that.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	I feed them meat!  I myself am totally against killing animals for MYSELF. But were my kitten and dog left to their own devices in the wild, would surely kill animals without a second thought... I don't impose my lifestyle onto my kitten or puppy one bit - they evolved to eat meat, and depriving them as such can be very dangerous.    Accurately speaking though, a dog is an omnivore, and can survive on vegetable matter - but he'd much rather a T-bone steak, I assure you =)|`|RcCJSSMPaa	My dog is a vegetarian too and the word is "their" not "there"|`|diWKJGUvaa	Marshmallows and popcorn...|`|vLVYN2ohaa	If you're going to deprive them of what they are naturally suppose to eat, don't own a cat or a dog. It's your CHOICE to be a vegetarian, it wasn't FORCED on you, and you are FORCING your dog to be vegetarian. Don't even think of torturing an animal just because you believe what they are doing NATURALLY is wrong. If you want a vegetarian pet, get a bird, get a hamster, a rabbit, or other herbivorous pet. Don't torment a dog or cat by denying them something they naturally eat. (this, to me, is more animal cruelty that the actual killing and eating of an animal, killing is quick, depriving them of what they are suppose to be will be a lengthy torture.)|`|8lTjwBEzaa	meat is good for everyone except eating human meat give them carrots|`|AkFag8tNaa	Not a vegetarian or even remotely resembling one but the greater moral issue that most people don't even think about is all the native species that are wiped out by cats (they are basically an invasive species)|`|AA12334360	Its that issue that stops me having dogs on my land. I personally see dog food as creating a market for dead cows - this is in contradition to my not eating meat in the first place. To me, the slaughter house doesn't care if I'm going to eat it or a dog is, all they care about is if there is a market.    for ME, i couldn't buy meat for a pet. Others feel different.    We have pet sheep and cows and so don't have that problem.|`|AA11702934	My pets LOVE the taste of:      HUNTERS  BULL RIDERS  VEAL RAISERS  FUR WEARERS  **** FIGHTERS  ETC.

Technically dogs are not true carnivores and do quite well on a human type vegetarian diet. The vegetable protein that nourishes us will nourish them.    Cats are a different story. They need meat. If you have a problem with that then don't keep cats.|`|LnjyQDpBaa	We're all for animal rights so we feed our pets what they need to be healthy.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	I think it's not fair to impose vegan or vegetarian beliefs onto an animal which is inately carnivorous. It would be irresponsible and cruel to deny them meat, and if that's going to be a problem for them, they should get a budgie instead. My sister is vegetarian but she feeds her dog with meat, bones & dry biscuits like most people do.

TY6eLCtTaa	no, la verdad que no me hace falta verlo, solo hace falta pensar un poco...  yo tambien soy vegetariana, y si bien, vi muchos videos de como mataban y maltrataban animales, se que no me hubieran hecho falta, e incluso los vi mucho despues de decidir ser vegetariana. como ya dije antes, solo hace falta pensar un poco, dejar de lado la educacion que recibimos y empezar a pensar por nosotros mismos, cuestionar los que se ve por "normal" y verlo desde nuestro propio punto de vista.     voy a empezar citando algunas respuestas que creo que van con e esto de la educacion que recibimos..         "NO. E visto mas de una vez, y suena cruel,pero la realidad es que para eso son los animales " (Dulce)    nos educan haciendonos creer que los animales estan puestos en la tierra para el servicio humano, para que nos alimentemos de ellos, nos vistamos con sus pieles, nos entretengan, transporten, etc... es mas! en la mismisima Biblia dice eso! que los animales dios los puso en la tierra para que los hombres los usen! asi que podriamos remontarnos miles y miles de a?os atras y tendriamos la misma educacion especista que se tiene ahora.  pero seamos realistas, pensemos solo un poco... realmente los animales estan en el mundo para el servicio humano?... porsupuesto que no! los animales tienen sus propios intereses, y sus propias vidas, no somos NADIE para arrebatarselas. y menos que menos por gula, por que no es que estamos en el medio de un desierto y lo unico que tenemos cerca e un animal, ahi seria cuestion de supervivencia... pero vamos! en la sociedad actual tenemos acceso a todo tipo de verduras y frutas de todo el mundo, cereales, legumbres, etc.  no necesitamos comer animales para sobrevivir. la prueba firme de esto son todos los vegetarianos del mundo que estan en perfecto estado de salud ( y es mas, la mayoria de las veces, hasta mejores que los que llevan una dieta omnivora).      "El animal da su vida para que nosotros vivamos. Si no nos los comemos, sera como una vida desperdiciada. Es parte de la cadena alimenticia, y nosotros somos parte de ella." Garuru Den    primero: el animal NO DA SU VIDA para que nosotros vivamos... se la arrebatan! lo matan! lo asesinan!.. solo para que? para que alguien disfrute de un "delicioso"  platillo.... realmente valen mas unos diez minutos de sabor a carne en tu boca  que toda la vida de un animal?..... eso es realmente una "vida desperdiciada"...  ahh... y lo de la cadena alimenticia... no creo que estuvieran tan de acuerdo con ella si fueran por ejemplo, una vaca.    demosnos cuenta de que desde chicos nos meten muchas cosas en la cabeza, nuestros padres, la sociedad, la tele, etc.   en el caso de nuestros padres, no lo hacen por maldad, pero es que es lo que les ense?aron a ellos, y si nunca se pusieron a replantearse este tipo de cosas, seguro siguen pensando que esta bien, y nos inculcan su forma de pensar.  a mi tambien me ense?aron que si uno no se alimenta con carne, seguro se enferma, me llevaron a zoologicos, a circos con animales, hasta en la escuela nos ense?an a sentirnos superiores a un animal....    pero un dia me di cuenta de que lo que me ense?aron no estaba bien, que no era cierto, y que estaba totalmente carente de principios eticos.  me puse a investigar, a leer sobre nutricion, a leer sobre el trato humano hacia los animales, su utilizacion, ver fotos y videos en internet, leer sobre experiencias y opiniones de otros vegetarianos, y saque mis proias conclusiones.    dejemos de decir como un lorito todo lo que escuchamos..|`|caJV6ZSmaa	el unico ser con rostro q como es el pezcado y, con algo de culpa, pero prefiero no pensarlo hasta q tenga los medios para cultivar mi alimento.|`|4qcSb944aa	Es posible, Pero si preguntaras a las personas que sacrifican estos animalitos estara casi seguro que ninguno de ellos es vegetariano, eres una persona muy sensible y esa sensibilidad te est acercando a ser una persona ms pura y espiritual,todo es cultural pero en tu caso veo que es circunstancial.te felicito!

Yo soy orgullosamente carnvoro y lo veo con esta filosofa: El animal da su vida para que nosotros vivamos. Si no nos los comemos, sera como una vida desperdiciada. Es parte de la cadena alimenticia, y nosotros somos parte de ella.    Lo que si es aberrante es cmo tratan a los animales en una fbrica de embutidos. Eso si es cruel e inhumano. Y detesto que el animal sufra antes de morir. Es mejor una tajada bien dada en el cuello y es una muerte instantnea y casi sin dolor, que una deshollada viva o una electrocucin en la espina dorsal. En eso los apoyo.

To kick off the construction of this pork medley youll need to create a 5x5 bacon weave. If the strips youre using arent wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with.   2.  The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave.   3.  Now that youre pork is well seasoned, its time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like.   4.  Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy.   5.  Add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. Once youve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave.   6.  Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside.   7.  At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but were missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up.   8.  Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. I recommend 2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter.   9.  Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. You'll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so theyll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces dont contain as much, so they wont set up as well. If youre dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and youll get the same effect.   10.  lice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.   11.  Obviously pork is best served by itself, but if you feel the need to make this meat monster into a sandwich, you can place couple Bacon Explosion slices on a warm Pillsburys Grands Biscuit.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	This step-by-step (with pictures) tutorial will show you exactly how to make the perfect BACON EXPLOSION:    http://www.bbqaddicts.com/bacon-explosio...|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	Idk but 'bacon explosion' gave me a *****.  I'm going to look this up!    Edit: Why is b0ner censored? It's a perfectly acceptable word for a blunder.  As in this topic made me erect and caused me to have a blunder.    Edit  2: Since you didn't mention what specific problems you are having I'll assume it has to do with the shrinking of the bacon.  Having just looked into this I realized I made something similar once for my dad (something wrapped in strips of bacon).  They shrank and ruined the whole effect.  And all he said was 'you know I'm watching my cholesterol,' as a thank you.  It was great to make something with good intentions and have it be so thorougly unappreciated.     Anyways I know you don't want links but have you seen this:  http://www.bbqaddicts.com/bacon-explosio...    It's pretty specific and look at that bad boy!!

You will only have to add enough liquid (stock) to cover the beans and other solid ingredients.    I would boil the beans for twenty minutes to be safe. Red kidney beans can be very toxic if not boiled sufficiently. Do not boil them in the same water you have soaked them in. Both the soaking water (Minimum soak of 5 hours) and the boiling water (absolute minimum of ten minutes) should be discarded.    Cooking in a slow cooker can make the beans MORE TOXIC if they have not been boiled for long enough so TAKE CARE.|`|dMtZXgOCaa	are you talking about a crock pot?

Debe quedar de un color morenito.   Variantes: -Al agregarle la segunda leche del coco se le ponen uvas pasas   -En lugar de tres tazas de agua en la segunda leche del coco se le ponen 1 taza de agua tivia y se completa con coca-cola, en ese caso se le debe disminuir el azucar.     -Tambien se puede hacer de sal, agregando solo la sal y las leches del coco.     Tipicamente se sirve con cualquier pescado de mar frito y ensalada de tomate, cebolla y lechuga.Pero tambien es usado en las ocasiones especiales con lomo de cerdo y otras ensaladas un poco ms especiales.   espero que te guste!!!!|`|zs8lCY7xaa	Puedes preparar unos camarones, sufreir los camorones en aceite de oliva y abundante ajo, luego pones el coco en la licuadora, le agregas  dos cucharadas de crema, una taza de leche, sal ,pimienta , cuando lo tengas licuado se lo viertes a los camarones y los dejas cocer a fuego lento, si no te agradan los camarones puedes sustituirlo por pollo.

La dulces, es preparar un arroz con leche, pones el arroz con leche a cocinar, le agregas azucar, canela y clavo, y cuando tenga la consistencia que quieres le agregas el coco rallado, queda de lujo.  La salada, es utilizar el coco con el arroz, primero doras el coco en la sarten, luego le agregas al arroz cocido y le pones tiras fritas de pollo o pescado.  Ambas quedan ricas y son faciles de hacer.  Suerte!!!
nw0ntrsKaa	juice is NOT healthy unless it is 100% juice. the reason you feel sick is because of the incredibly high amount of sugar in any juice, natural OR processed. HI C and sunny D are both really unhealthy. if you realllly want to drink juice you should go with something like cranberry juice cocktail. grape and apple juice both have a lot of sugar as well. if you want to make up for nutrients, drink milk. orange juice doesnt have that much sugar. get a natural or organic juice with a low sugar percentage to be healthier.|`|BNA3mhpBaa	Juice is not healthy.  Especially that crap you have been drinking.  Eat the raw fruit instead.|`|2EEXaymXaa	You need to keep reading labels and pick the ones with the least sugar possible.    Also, pasta and bread do NOT make up for no meat.  You need to eat plenty of beans to try to get some protein in your diet.  Meat is protein - pasta and bread are not.    To be healthy while being a vegetarian, you need to do a lot of research on nutrition so you can plan your meals to make up for the protein and iron you are missing out on from meat.|`|gmmZWQgsaa	You should drink more water. Water has 0 of everything.|`|AA11012938	To be completely honest you should go with a fully natural fruit juice, drinks like Sunny D are known for thier additives!    Go to your local herbal centre and ask for advice. they can easily help you with alternatives for your meat- free diet!    In the meantime, try things like spinach to get iron content into your body, which is one of the prime things you miss as a vegetarian!
AA11309717	You can absolutely do it that way.you won't get quite the same flavor but it will be moist and tender.. Another good flavor is orange juice or any fruit juice with the zest (peeled colored skin) of the  same fruit|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Sounds good. I use all kind of vinegiarettes. Raspberry, pomagranite etc...    They are all so good and chicken goes with pretty much anything. Fruits, acidic, creamy etc...    Marinate it then it would be good if you crunched up some torilla chips and make a  breading/dredge. Brown in a skillet then finish in the over.    Or left over would be great in a salad with black beans, tomatoes, corn, tortilla chips etc...    Okay I got a little carried away. You didn't ask for how to make it after you marinated it, it just sounds good and made my mind wander.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	It's not going to taste the same, but it won't be bad. I marinate chicken in Italian dressing a lot before cooking it.  It makes it more tender, and flavors it, but it doesn't taste like italian marinade.|`|6Jw6Q4Y0aa	actually sounds pretty good, i would try it, i have used italian dressing,and ranch , so i don't see why not. :)gl|`|vvoz2jeyaa	it definately will have a different taste than the southwest sauce but it sounds fantastic! Im gonna try that with my smoked chicken for tomorrow nights dinner!
FicyC2TXaa	No it wasn't too much - it was inadequate both in terms of calories and in terms of nutrition.    Lying down motionless all day uses 1200 calories for the average person. At your age you need more calories than an adult does. Whether you had your main meal at lunch time or in the evening - you don't say - you were running on empty for much of the day.    And apart from two apples tou have had no veg or fruit. Rather than worrying about eating less, concentrate on eating better quality food. Add cereal to your breakfast, eat something nutritious and filling at lunchtime - soup, salad, sandwich for example - and make sure your evening meal includes vegetables.    Trying to cut back drastically on food, especially at your age, can mean weight gain in the future. Bodies don't know about diets, they know about famine - when they perceive a food shortage, they store fat for future use and shed lean muscle.    Believe me I know; at your age I did the same and felt so proud and self-controlled if I got through a day on just a few hundred calories. I wasn't overweight when I started that nonsense, but I soon gained, and have had a lifetime's struggle to keep excess weight off ever since - I'm in my fifties now.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	Apple - 65kcal each (x2) = 130kcal.  Cookie - 123kcal           = 123 + 130   = 253kcal.  Portion potatoes - ~144kcal = 144 + 253 = 397kcal.  Beef stripes assuming it was 1 serve = 145kcal = 145+ 397  = 542kcal  Nacho chips - 350kcal = 542 + 350 = 892kcal.    Even for your age (and assuming you're of average height and weight), you've consumed a lot LESS than what you should be consuming. This is very unhealthy, and a reoccurring pattern of this diet will cause many deficiencies and diet-related health issues. I urge to increase your vitamin and mineral intake along with protein, fat, carbohydrate and calories.    All in appropriate amounts and remember - moderation.|`|AA11095456	um .... NO.  you can do with some more......... don't let me come over there|`|b9uOax0aaa	That would be enough for my midmorning snack.|`|X3tMdpF6aa	No, you haven't eaten too much but if you want to be really healthy try cutting out nacho chips and fats/sugar from things like cookies.   Calories along with grams of fat and carbohydrates are all important factors to pay attention to when trying to lose weight.

Bring to a boil. Add a large fist-full of spaghetti pasta.  while pasta is cooking  (10-12 mins.)  In large bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, garlic, bread crumbs, salt and pepper   (best to  mix with your hands) Shape mixture into 1 1/2 inch  meatballs.

Brown meatballs in a non-stick skillet, 8-10 mins or until no longer pink, turning occasionally. Drain grease (if any) and add spaghetti sauce and oregano. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low.

Preheat oven to 180 C / Gas mark 4.     2.   Place the chicken breasts in a 23x33 cm (9x13 in) baking dish. Combine the apricot preserves, vinegar and sugar. Pour the preserve mixture over the chicken, cover and bake for 40 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.    Serve with rice and a mixed green salad if desired.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	TRY THIS:  Ground beef, browned in a skillet.  1/2 a kilo (1 pound) or more.  1 small white onion, chopped (or more if you like onions)  1 green bell pepper, chopped (red and yellow peppers may also be used)  1 can diced tomatoes, 425 g (15 oz.)  1 can tomato sauce, 425 g (15 oz)  2 cans kidney beans 425 g (15 oz)  Add any or all of the following spices: Paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano leaves, parsley leaves, salt, pepper, chili powder.  Judge the amounts by your personal preference.  I'd recommend starting out with small amounts of each of these.   NOTE:  You may increase the quantities of these ingredients if you have a lot of people to feed.  Combine all of these ingredients into a suitable pot and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour.  Congratulations!  You've just made chili con carne.  You can serve it with rice or noodles, or by itself.   If you have any left over, it should be good for two or three days in the refrigerator.  Personally, I rarely have leftovers when I make this stuff.|`|gvbK8VHgaa	just hit it with a spice weasel *BAM*|`|sqPglTDVaa	Pan Couscous with Chorizo and Green Beans    1 tablespoon olive oil  1 red onion, sliced  2 cloves, garlic  1 long red chili, sliced  2 chorizo sausages, sliced  400g can chopped tomatoes  2 cups chicken stock  150g green beans, sliced  1 1/4 cups couscous  1 cup coriander leaves    Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat.  Add the oil, onion, garlic, chili and chorizo and cook for 1-2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, stock and beans and sprinkle over the couscous.  Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes or untill liquid is absorbed.  Top with coriander to serve.      This is super easy and quick but if you want to make things easier.  Used minced garlic instead of fresh, replace the chili with some dried chilli flakes or powder and use frozen sliced green beans.

SjDVMh3Uaa	Do not drink if you are on anti depressants. Apparently you have a serious problem with alcohol because judging from what you just said you drink to numb the pain of being depressed. Alcohol makes depression worse. It is your choice but one I say don't make.  Alcoholism is not a disease it is a choice.|`|2oYo4krQaa	If you need someone to talk to, go to AA.

My friend, the decision is yours, I don't want to pressure you into drinking again * takes a gulp of Guinness *|`|9N3hAbFwaa	I know what you mean. When I turned 19(legal drinking age in Canada), I was getting drunk practically every night. Now what I do is drink twice a week. I have around 6 - 8 drinks a week. On the days I am not allowed to drink, I stay away from alcohol (though sometimes it can be hard).     Your situation is a little different because you are taking anti-depressants. I don't think you are allowed to consume alcohol while you are on those pills. Also, if you are suffering from depression, alcohol might make things worse for you. What you need to do is talk to your doctor and ask if it is okay for you to drink.
