Avez vous remarqué, que avec le RMI, les aides aux logements, les primes, le salaire pour la formation, les allocation pour les enfants, de plus en plus de personne fraude. Pour la classe des salaire haut, pas de probleme, pour la classe des salaire bas, ceci et logique, mais pour la classe moyenne qui représentante plus de 50 %, mieux vos ne pas travailler.

20090226125129AAArnQC	Local Businesses;United States;Other - US Local Businesses	Do you think this is wrong or know the email address?	Now this could be a rumor, but here's what I heard...      A soldier from my small town recently died in Iraq. Last week, when one of his family members was going around town and putting up signs about his memorial service, she decided that she wanted to put one in Dunkin' Donuts. When she got their she asked the store owner if she could put it in one of the front doors or windows of the store. The reply she got was "Sure, I'll hang it up, back here, outside, on the dumpster, where the rest of our US Soldiers belong".       Now.. Here's a few questions about this:   Do you think that this is wrong?   Do you know an email address in which I could email Dunkin' Donuts and ask them if this is true?                                               OR   Should I just leave it alone since  it already happened?

20090226130516AAMphQ7	Local Businesses;United States;New York City	What Bank Is The Best Bank To Have In NYC?	I currently have a WaMu account, but they made post adjustment. They took away 20 dollars. I called the company, and they didn't know why i lost those 20 dollars, they ordered a search. This happened to me before, losing an additional 40 dollars. I'm 17 years old and to me 60 is quite a lot (almost 10 hours of work), and i want to change to another bank that wont give me the same trouble, I was wondering if you could give me the best, most trustworthy bank in New York City. It would be gladly appreciated. Thank You =D
