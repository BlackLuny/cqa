20090220133815AAgKnUT	Politics & Government;Government	How important is dissidence to our society, when does it become?	Is Rush Limbaugh hoping for Obama's (and the country's) failure an example of healthy political dissidence or is it harmful contrariety?  What about people vehemently opposed to the Iraq war? I believe Social and political dissidence is a very important element of our foundation.  Without groups opposition to the government, there would be no civil rights, no women's rights, no workers rights.   I think that those who try to squash the voice of the opposing view are more damaging to our way of life than those who dissent.  It is just as harmful to stand by and let the government run wild than to be the ones running it wild.  And you cannot answer this from a partisan view.  Democrats and republicans share the responsibility/accountability of healthy dissidence.  Republicans can't just label anyone who opposes them as socialist, and Dems cant just call their opposition racists.

Democrats strike different tone on Katrina   By BEN EVANS – 1 day ago       WASHINGTON (AP) — The economic stimulus signed by President Barack Obama will spread billions of dollars across the country to spruce up aging roads and bridges. But there's not a dime specifically dedicated to fixing leftover damage from Hurricane Katrina.      And there's no outrage about it.      Democrats who routinely criticized President George W. Bush for not sending more money to the Gulf Coast appear to be giving Obama the benefit of the doubt in his first major spending initiative. Even the Gulf's fiercest advocates say they're happy with the stimulus package, and their states have enough money for now to address their needs.       http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/arti...

20090220134553AAONMjE	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did Obama promise a world without nuclear weapons yet Iran is developing one at full throttle?	You can find video evidence of Obama promising a world without nuclear weapons on youtube. Just type in Obama nightmare and you will find it. Ironically since Obama became president nuclear arms is speeding up with North Korea launching an ICBM (missile).      Seeing as Iran supplied hamas militants with medium range rockets free of charge I would hate to think what happens when they acquire warheads. Also.. just because Iran doesn't launch them directly it doesn't mean they are innocent.      If Iran gives a nuclear bomb to a terrorist they should be repeatedly hydrogen bombed until their land is completely flattened and absent of life.

Newly poor swell lines at U.S. food banks    By Julie Bosman Published: February 19, 2009      MORRISTOWN, New Jersey: Cindy Dreeszen and her husband live in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States. They have steady jobs, his at a movie theater and hers at a government office. Together, they earn about $55,000 a year.      But with a 17-month-old son, another baby on the way, and, as Dreeszen put it, "the cost of everything going up and up," the couple went to a food pantry this month to ask for some free groceries.      "I didn't think we'd even be allowed to come here," said Dreeszen, 41, glancing around at the shelves of fruit, whole-wheat pasta and baby food.

If you are an Obama supporter and are STILL behind him all the way I have one question for you........What to hell is your problem?      YUP I supported this "brilliant Harvard Grad" who said he was for the middle class. I didn't listen to those "right wing" talking points. I went on my own instinct. That didn't work out too well.       As it turns out, he is nothing more than a welfare king. Give to those who do nothing and take from those who do. I never saw it coming. Nope. Too naive. Too trusting. Too damn blind. Now look what he has done in one damn month and you stupid fools are dumber than I was because you are still supporting this smooth talker.       Hope that works out well for you all. My only hope and resolve will be in 2010 when this travesty can be somewhat turned around.      To all those who hate me for voting for this moron, I don't blame you. Go ahead and let me have it. I deserve it.

I couldn't stand the embarrassment so i just paid 25pounds and recieve some sort of fine receipt with my details on it. does this mean i have a criminal record? as i just seen online and that people do receive it but they were brought to court.

A couple of months ago I was at a restaurant and apparently this girl got her car damaged. She works at the restaurant. I got a call from a detective saying she wrote down my license plate and turned me in for a hit and run. My problem is that this NEVER happened. My husband was in the truck with me the whole time and it never happened. She has a witness that works with her and that girl's father is a deputy sheriff. The detective is trying to pressure me into saying that I did it, so we can just "get it taken care of" so he says. It is only 200 dollars worth of damage, and she is saying I backed into her and scratched her car. I drive a double cab HUGE pickup and if I backed into her it would cause massive damage on her little sports car. She is also saying I looked at her in the rear view and just drove off. I was in that parking lot for 10 minutes and she never came up to me, not to mention I have a double cab with tinted windows and a galvanized headache rack, so she could have never seen me in my rear view. That detective is threatening me saying he is going to make it a hit and run. What should I do? How can someone pick a car at random, write down their license plate number and fabricate something like this?

20090203042901AA35yvZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why are the Obamanazi so hard at work to destroy my rights?	Legislation to require a federal license to possess any detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifle or shotgun, or any handgun, has been introduced in Congress. Bills to re-impose the federal "assault weapon" and "large" magazine ban, or to impose a much broader ban, have been introduced in Congress since 2003, and will likely be introduced in the current Congress soon.       Already, the deliberate deceptions we heard from anti-gunners previously are resurfacing.  Anti-gun Sen. Carl Levin, D-MI, said last Thursday on the floor of the Senate that "assault weapons" are "capable of firing up to 600 rounds per minute" and that they are "once again pervading our streets and neighborhoods."       Did we mention that our opponents are deliberately deceptive?       Many fully-automatic firearms can fire 10 rounds in a second, which theoretically would work out to 600 rounds per minute, but they cannot be reloaded fast enough to achieve anything near that rate in reality. But we are not talking about fully-automatic firearms—we're talking about semi-automatics, and the difference between them need not be explained here.       "Pervading our streets?" Anti-gun lawmakers swore up and down that once the "assault weapon" ban expired, the murder rate would go through the roof. Well, the ban expired in 2004 and since then, the murder rate has gone down to a 43-year low.

The scarey part is "(4) to meet   other appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland   Security" from Sec 2 Paragraph b         Rep. Hastings created controversy during the 2008 presidential   campaign with his provocative comments concerning Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.      "If Sarah Palin isn't enough of a reason for you to get over whatever   your problem is with Barack Obama, then you damn well had better pay attention,"   Hastings said, as reported by ABC News.

20090203044528AAFVf6Z	Politics & Government;Government	Did you ever wonder how government contracting works?	The White House Fence      Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House   in   DC: One is from New York , another is from Tennessee and the third, is   from   Florida .      All three go with a White House official to examine the fence      The Florida contractor takes out a tape measure and does some   measuring,   then works some figures with a pencil. "Well," he says, "I figure the   job   will run about $900: $400 for materials, $400 for my crew and $100   profit   for me."      The Tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then   says,   "I can do this job for $700: $300 for materials, $300 for my crew and   $100   profit for me."      The New York contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to   the   White House official and whispers, "$2,700." The official,   incredulous,   says, "You didn't even measure like the other guys! How did you come   up with   such a high figure?"      The New York contractor whispers back, "$1000 for me, $1000 for you,   and we   hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence." "Done!" replies the   government official. And that, my friends, is how government   contracting   works!
20090203044914AAJTuYU	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is his warning too late?	"You cannot legislate the poor into freedom  by   legislating the wealthy out of freedom.  What one  person   receives without working for, another person must work  for   without receiving. The government cannot give to  anybody   anything that the government does not first take  from   somebody else.  When half of the people get the  idea that   they do not have to work because the other half is  going to   take care of them, and when the other half gets the  idea   that it does no good to work because somebody else is  going   to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is  about the   end of any nation.  You cannot multiply wealth  by  dividing   it."   ~~~~~ The late Dr. Adrian Rogers, 1931 - 2005  ~~~~~

What do we have to do to get there? We would like to live near the beach so where would be a good beach to be near or even on? we have dreams of living in a beach house or hut (if were not been to picky lol - like i said 'dreams'). We obviously want good jobs (I enjoy computers and technology and my girlfriend likes textiles/ occasion planning) and not too big of a house, we would want to be close to a city for obvious reasons like shopping and jobs. We would obviously want to be in a nice area, and just somewhere that we can settle down and just enjoy being there, so which would be best America or Australia? What are the usual expenses and procedures to get there? It would be nice if we could get good advice from both, I don't really want to be put off lol but please say the truth. Thank you.

20090203045610AAjpa4P	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What's the legal penalty in Virginia (or in general) for stealing livestock (a goat in this case)?	Let's say I live near a guy who keeps goats, and the goats keep wandering up into my property when I'm gone and eating my grass and shrubs.      The thing is, the neighbor is a good guy in general; he's just getting older and forgetful.  I don't know how much longer he can take care of his farm animals.        But as long as these goats are eating my grass anyway, I kind of want to steal one and eat it.  I can't resell it at the livestock auction, because all the goats are tagged and ID chipped.  I also don't want to put up a fence, because we share some trees that are MOSTLY on his side, and a fence would put them out of my reach.      I asked the guy once if I could just buy a goat from him, but he said he doesn't want to sell or slaughter any of them.  They are his pets or something.  He's a strange dude.      I probably won't get caught, but if I somehow am, what is the likely penalty for a guy with no previous record who gets busted for stealing a goat and eating it?  I have a captive bolt pistol and a garage, so the slaughter is not a problem.

20090203050034AA2FvLm	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Are the police really doing enough to keep us safe?	I personally do not think so.    I feel that the police are very lazy these days, they can't be bothered with the paperwork and rarely follow cases up.      For example, over the past two months I have been harrassed by an anonymos man via mobile phone, he has left obscene messages detailing what he is going to do to me sexually, he has also claimed he has been watching me.  The calls are 24/7, through the night and during the day. I have ended up just keeping my phone in a drawer and checking it now and then so that I can log the calls.   I reported this to the police, but nothing has been done. A police report has been filed, but they have yet to phone the network to trace these phone calls.    I feel like the police are being very negligent, does someone need to be raped/killed or stabbed before the police will actually do ANYTHING ??            Thoughts....?
20090220163203AA0CXHD	Politics & Government;Politics	Lies and Manipulation to control people?	Okay. I was in my room thinking about something. What is this called?   A person has a lie and wants to make it true. So they tell people that that "something" is true, but really it's a lie. And  when people react to the lie and believe the lie, it actually makes the lie, true. For example, if I tell people we are going to run out of t-shirts tomorrow you better buy them while they are still cheap. Which is a lie. But people will believe it and go buy as many shirts as they can. And what happens? The next day they run out of t-shirts. I've just turned a lie into the truth.       What is this called? Also, do you think this is being used by media/govt on the economy crisis?

I was reading an article the other day about a study done at the Barack Obama Institute for Change about how Americans feel about certain things. I was surprised to see that most Americans like paying taxes, and they wish their taxes were higher then they are now. It's a myth, perpetrated by racist Republicans that people don't like paying taxes so people who don't work can reap the benefits. The study interviewed over 10,000 people and found that 95% of them wish their taxes were almost double what they are now. Most people also felt that Republicans complain too much about taxes.      Why can't you guys just pay your taxes without complaint? Paying your taxes without complaint is part of being a patriotic American.

I know that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour  brought the US into the war against the Axis powers. However, could the Nazi's not  have avoided war with the US,prior to this ,say by agreeing to a special non aggression pact with the US(Just like they did  with the Soviets) even if they were allies of Japan. For I find it hard to believe that the Nazi's,would allow their alliance with Japan, to enable the US  to declare war on them,because of the actions of the Japanese, if that is not what they wanted.

Can she leave Ohio and go to South Carolina, miss the court date and refuse the test without some sort of punishment? I know that she only loses her state aid if she refuses the test through child support, but we're going to try to get one court ordered if the other doesn't work.

20090220155731AADCtkU	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do people compare O to Roosevelt and the New Deal when the differences are more than alikeness?	1.  FDR started a series of programs spread over years, not all-encompassing packages like the new proposals.      2.  In 1933, 1st thing he did was revamp government structure/ and eliminate waste in government      3.The largest of Roosevelt's jobs programs, the Works Progress Administration, begun in 1935, did provide jobs across the nation building roads, bridges and other projects. Among his other job-creating programs were the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Civil Works Administration, the Public Works Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority.      "Roosevelt came late to some of the ideas of big public spending to stimulate the economy," said John Halpin, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.         4  Roosevelt's efforts to fight the Depression with government spending caused outlays to rise to 10.3 percent of GDP by 1939 and to 12 percent by 1941 on the eve of U.S. involvement in World War II.      By contrast, government spending was 21 percent of GDP last year. Obama's economic recovery policies are expected to bring it up to 30 percent or more.      "The New Deal by today's standards involved a minuscule amount of spending," said Allan J. Lichtman, a professor of political history at American University. He said Obama is more of a "big spender" than was Roosevelt.      Roosevelt had a bigger crisis on his hands. Unemployment was at 25 percent when he took office.      Last month's jobless rate was 7.6 percent, up from 4.9 percent a year before but still shy of the postwar high of 10.8 percent reached in 1982 — and far from Great Depression levels.

The situation came down to his word against hers with the higher ups "investigating" and finding no proof for either side.  The matter was handled by separating the 2 with no contact.  Yesterday she heard a rumor that another woman there was making claims against this same man.  My sisters boss pulled her into the office to let her know that if she had heard the rumors, it is against policy to speak about confidential matters and she was not permitted to talk to this other woman. My question is...  can they legally tell her she cannot speak about this to someone directly involved?  I understand not talking to the whole office - but, the boss is trying to sweep it under the rug again, where she actually has a chance to finaly be vindicated. Any legal advice would be greatly appreeciated.

I was with them on the night they did it and did a car myself. I only took a couple of cds but we threw them out. The cop came to my house this morning with my friends in the back of the car and i allowed him to search my room. I didn't/don't have any stolen property because we threw out the cds but I did have my auto jigglers and he took those. We picked the worst night to do it because apparently there was other people out doing it to and credit cards and laptops got stolen out of cars and houses got broken in to on the same night so they think we are connected even though we just wanted to see if the jigglers even worked. The cop said he didn't take me to jail because I was completely honest and straight forward. He said he is going to send me a letter in the mail telling me when I have to go to court. He said because its my first offense that I will most likely get off with just probation but because i am 18 I could do a couple of days in jail.

I am technically still a dependent.  and ONLY because i am not married, have a child, am 24, or a veteran.  i think this is RIDICULOUS that i cannot afford to go to college just because my parents make money.

His character is completely and utterly flawed, based on his flip flop ideology.  So would those who voted for Obama based on the color of his skin be considered racist by Mr. King today?

20090220104110AAw9Lwx	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What is my rights are a noncustodial parent?	Hi Everyone    Here is a little back ground. I am a noncustodial parent (male) I have resonable visitation rights( can someone explian that to me?). I currently live 50 miles away from my child, and I don't have a car, but the mother does have a car. Can I compel the court to allow for her to meet me half way so that the visitation order can be full-filled?       Also, part of my childsupport pays for back childsupport. The reason I owe back childsupport was that I was unsure the child was mines, but I still provided for the child, but when she took me to child support out of malice, which was the case because I was getting married to someone else she had a problem with. I guess I did the immature thing of not paying until the child support case was done. When the child support case was done I ended up paying less for child support then what I was given her, but she also new I was going to have to pay back childsupport, because the legal system works very slow. She saw it as a huge check coming to her. So I ended up owing 2,100 in back child support and since in the state of Illinios if you owe more than 500 they put your name in the tax intercept database. I currently was expecting a refund of 2042 but the intercepted it. I would like to know if that amount will be posted to my account balance or since I have an agreement for partial payments built into my childsupport amount ever pay period will they release check to me or keep it?

I am 17 years old and I live in Nashville, TN--Are they legally allowed to do this without parental consent? They never asked for my age, but now I am wondering what the laws are for this. I am not worried at all..I am just annoyed at the whole situation! I had to go way off to some place to take the test which I shouldnt have had to take in the first place!

I was about ot have an axniety attack, and I just figure do what the cop says instead of arguing.  Now my insurance company is saying I'm 100 % at fault, (because I did i backed into this guy, but i never admitted to hitting anybody, I was just doing what the officer told me to do).  Now I'm screwed, I think the other drive is comitting fraud, and I have to pay the price.  What do I do?  And no I can't afford a lawyer.

Almost one month after he was told he would get a pay check, he got one for only $133.91. Even if taxes had been taken out it would have been much more then 133 bucks.

In my school when we do research in the library they have the mps blocks on certain sites for pornography..etc; however, we are doing a report for American history on the 1920's - 1930's and our groups assignment was the rise of the kkk; however when we try to find good information; including the official site naturally it's blocked for hate speech and racism purposes... understood. But why is it when i go to the new black panther official website and read  things like      "We want full employment for our people and we demand the dignity to do for ourselves what we have begged the white man to do for us.   We believe that since the white man has kept us deaf, dumb and blind, and used every “dirty trick” in the book to stand in the way of our freedom and independence, that we should be gainfully employed until such time we can employ and provide for ourselves."      "We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this devilish and decadent American society"      "We want all Black People when brought to trial to be tried in a court by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities, as defined by white law of the Constitution of the United States."      Are these not as racially and radically charged as the kkk; they are both terrorist groups setting our country back many many years, but why the double standard? Why is it not blocked under categories of "extreme" "racism" "hate speech"?  Would that be racist if we did?      This is an open discussion I am interested if anyone believes these double standards will end, such as racially charged scholarships, racially charged months of the year, and affirmative action!
