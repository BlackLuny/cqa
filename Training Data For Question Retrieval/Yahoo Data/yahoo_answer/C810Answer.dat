I bet you will be amazing!! Start by watching the channels, or just googling random recipes. That's the greatest way I found out. Improvise. Make your OWN dish, not somebody elses. Start with something easy, like chicken. And then make your way to meats. Good luck hun!!|`|zawmsUO1aa	Cook boneless skinless chicken breasts in a skillet with a little oil about 4 minutes per side on medium heat. Add one chopped onion, cook briefly and add 1 cup of chicken broth. Cook about 3 minutes then add one jar of spaghetti sauce.

Drain the pasta and serve the chicken and sauce over the pasta.  Add some bagged salad and Italian bread and there’s a meal.|`|ml76J5F7aa	One of my fav!!!!

But since I know about it I will answer it for you anyway. It means that two people agree to have sexual relations between the two of them without any type of emotional strings attached. They also agree that at the same time they are free to have any amount of sexual relations with anyone else during the same time. It is alot like masterbation in that area because it doesn't help the relationship between them grow at all. Its just a moment of weakness taking place because they are both desperate during the time it is taking place. |`|AA10020034	It means a friend that you aren't in a romantic relationship as in dating, cuddling, or future commitment etc but occasionally you have sex with them.<br>  <br>  F- - - buddies is another term. <br>  <br>  It is very hard for these relationships to work out.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	meaning you get to do things or done things with a person you've known for a while, a friend, or a girl/boy who is not officially you're girl/boy friend<br>  <br>  things: like kiss, hug, (basically) 1st,, 2nd , 3rd base?|`|21680c9a10053eab0bfdbf4390bb7f08aa	Basically, it means the boy wants sex (benefits) with no strings attached (no loving, no caring, no real relationship, no respect).|`|m70fi75Aaa	This phrase refers to people who are your friends but you have sex with them but don't have a boyfriend/girl fiend relationship with them.

Alot of people are just looking for one night stands, or worse. Your life, and your call though.   <br>  <br>  2. That depends on your metabolism, what you are drinking, how fast, and a bunch of other factors. If you limit yourself to two or three mixed drinks in over an hour or two, you should feel a buzz, but mostly remain in control. <br>  <br>  3. People who do that usually quaff large amouts of high proof stuff in short periods of time. Just take your time, stick to mixed drinks, or wine/beer and you should be okay. <br>  <br>  Good luck with meeting people, and your first time drinking. <br>  
XvG97CTPaa	100 calorie packs of Diamond brand almonds are one of my favorite healthy snacks. A jar of peanut butter is always a great investment for healthy non refrigerated snacks as long as you don't eat the whole jar at once =D<br>  Get some low calorie/carb whole wheat wraps.  Mission brand makes one that is only 80 calories per wrap. Spread on a little peanut butter and add a mini box of raisins, roll and enjoy. Though you did say no fruits and raisins are a fruit, you could also add some crisp rice cereal to the wrap for a little crunch, or some honey. Dry cereals are a good snack too- most have healthy vitamins and whole grain. Just separate the cereal into small zip lock bags of one serving each.

Depending on where you live and where they like to eat, your restaurant choices will be limited to possibly a baked potato and side salad. I am a vegan and I hate for people to cater to me, but at the same time I need to kinda mix and match foods (if I see two chicken salads on the menu, I'll ask for one without chicken and ask if I can add veggies that I see on the other salad, for example). I don't like telling people I'm a vegan because I think it pisses some people off, and sometimes those I'm dining with will say, "She's a vegan" when I start asking for substitutions. It makes me feel like I'm being a douche. I just say, "I can't have X." I'd rather they think I was lactose intolerant or something. <br>  <br>  2. People constantly assuming that you're malnourished. This is a serious pet peeve of mine. You know what I do for fun? I'm a bodybuilder. I'm a vegan bodybuilder and I have people telling me that I won't get protein or calcium being a vegan. I'm making better gains in the gym as a vegan than I ever was as an omnivore!<br>  <br>  3. People assume you're with PETA or somesuch stupid organization. I didn't become a vegan for animal rights...that's just a perk for me. I don't throw blood on people, I'm not opposed to fur, and I will be hunting this winter (I just won't eat any of what I kill, only a bite or two). I went vegan to manage an incurable disability I got in the Marine Corps. <br>  <br>  4. People not understanding what the f*ck a vegan is. When I say, "Does that have milk in it? I can't have milk" and they say, "Well, if there IS milk, it'll be nonfat milk," that doesn't solve my problem. People have a very dumb idea about what it is, especially thanks to people who eat fish and chicken and call themselves "vegetarians." <br>  <br>  5. People getting into my health because they overhear that I'm a vegan. I hate eavesdropping, and I hate people sticking their nose in my business. That sh*t happens. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. |`|LE1wmDc9aa	Con #1: FOOD AVAILABILITY. Forget about eating at Outback steakhouse, Cracker Barrel or many other restaurants. Their idea of a vegetarian meal is 3 vegetable sides. You also have to find all sorts of replacements to cook with at home. Trust me, my soups just haven't been the same since I gave up chicken and beef bouillon. Adding more spices just isn't the same. Unless you live in a big city (which we don't), vegetarian friendly restaurants and grocery stores may be small, if existent at all. You learn to be pretty creative. <br>  <br>  Con #2: Getting all of your needed nutrition. It is a lot harder for vegetarians to get the B12 vitamin. Without it, your brain can actually shrink, scary right? You have to be very conscious about getting all of your vitamins. Even more so with strict vegetarians/vegans, since they will not be eating eggs or dairy as well. <br>  <br>  Con #3: Social gatherings. It's really annoying to explain every time that you don't eat meat. No, vegetarians don't eat chicken or fish either. No, vegetarians don't eat soup with made with meat broth or mashed potatoes made with chicken broth. If you go to someone's house to eat (or even some catered events) you may be either left out (and starving) or get a sub-par meal of something like leftover pasta with some reheated vegetables. You have to make sure that they know in advance that you will need a special meal. <br>  <br>  Con #4: Less cultured peoples' attitudes towards you. The classic "we weren't put at the top of the food chain to eat rabbit food" types. They can even try to TRICK you into eating meat. They don't respect your decision and may even harass you.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	1) People who ask idiotic questions about will the animals take over or go extinct; about whether we can eat animal crackers; about the plants; etc.  And the classic:  But what do you eat?<br>  <br>  2) In many restaurants, options are limited.  A lot of places think vegetarian means just dump cheese all over it.  Forget about vegan!<br>  <br>  3) The endless spate of meat-centric commericals when you watch TV or look at a newspaper, especially around holidays.  Easter, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving--meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.<br>  <br>  4) When you go to special dinners, unless it's for a pro-animal group, you may not get fed.  Most people have no clue about what we can eat.  I've been asked at least twice whether or not I eat olive oil.  Uh, it comes from olives, which are plants, so yes.<br>  <br>  I guess most of it comes down to people not understanding what veg*ans eat and how to cook without corpses.|`|q19Sxa14aa	1.

Dairy has quite a bit of it, so make sure you add good fats into your diet. Buy some nuts - almonds, cashews, peanuts - but make sure they are raw (unsalted and not flavored). If you like avocados, they are also a good source of fat. Cooking/sauteing your veggies in some good EVOO is also a good way to add fats into your diet. Just don't go overboard. Our bodies don't need too much of it. <br>  <br>  If you use butter a lot, you should totally buy some Earth Balance. It's the best non-dairy butter out there! I love it and cannot tell the difference between it and its more "robust" counterparts. It cooks and bakes well too.<br>  <br>  I'm not a huge fan of soy cheese. It just doesn't do it for me, but you might find that it tastes good. <br>  <br>  Some staples that I always have on hand:<br>  ~Brown rice. I eat the stuff almost every day. I love it and it can go in a lot of dishes. <br>  ~Black beans (dry): They are a great source of protein and of course, the fibre content is a bonus.<br>  ~Frozen stir-fry veggies: I belong to a warehouse club and I buy a huge bag of Asian-style veggies. They can be made into stir-fry, lo mien, soups and "skillet" casseroles. The possibilities are endless and flash-frozen veggies are much better than canned ones. <br>  ~Flax seeds: Good source of Omega 3 fatty acids (promotes healthy brain function). They add a nice nutty flavor to my cereals. They are also great substitutes for eggs when baking when you add water. <br>  ~Mushrooms: I like to eat them just as a snack, but they also go well in pasta. They are a good source of fibre, protein and folic acid. <br>  <br>  As others have mentioned, www.vegweb.com is a good site for recipes. I found an awesome jambalaya recipe on there. It was SO good! The mock meatloaf is also good. There are scads of ideas in lots of categories. You cannot get bored/tired when you peruse that site for ideas. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hJ9iFzujaa	it's really not that tough to convert from vegetarian to vegan.  If you've been relying a lot on dairy for protein, then make sure to get extra beans and whole grains to make up for it.  Obviously get soymilk (or any other non-dairy milk...almond and rice milk are tasty too)..make sure you get a brand that is enriched with calcium and vitamin D.  Soy yogurt is good if you eat a lot of yogurt.  Silk brand yogurt is pretty good.  You'll also need to be more conscious about calcium.  Dark leafy greens such as kale and swiss chard are great sources of calcium and lots of other nutrients, and they're pretty cheap, too.  You'll need some source of vitamin B12, as that is the only nutrient that is not available from vegetable sources.  So either get a vitamin, or look to see if your soymilk or cereal is enriched with it.  <br>  <br>  I'd actually recommend avoiding vegan cheese at first.  While the taste isn't bad, it's really not that much like real cheese.  If you eat it right away, there's a good chance you'll think it's gross and will be disappointed.  Wait until you don't really remember what real cheese tastes like before you try it.<br>  <br>  Before I became vegan, finding a good "ice cream" was essential...my favorite is Purely Decadent, made by Turtle Mountain.  A lot of grocery stores carry it in their natural/organic section, or if you have a local co-op or health food store look there.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your transition!

9f87c8a92289b4d29480e289a2689d90aa	Cask ale is a working ale, it has to be properly kept from receipt to point of sale, It needs to be racked, and allowed to settle, hard pegged, then soft pegged when almost ready. The beer works and inside the barrel there are hops, to keep and preserve the beer and taste. A well kept real ale is a quality drink, and poorly kept ale is well horrid!

I have a son who is 20 mths old and who can't have dairy or eggs. I am breastfeeding him until he self weans and this is the only reason I am happy for him to be (almost) vegan aswell.<br>  I agree that the best way to do it is not to rely too much on processed foods. beans, pulses, lots of veg and fruit obviously. Saying that i have found vegan "mince" and vegan sausages to be cheaper than the organic meat sausages or meat i would usually buy so i guess it depends on what kind of food you bought before.<br>  the other thing i do is order a veg box to be delivered once a week, for me it costs 25 pounds and has all the veg and fruit we need for that whole week - maybe that wuold be an option to keep the cost down a bit<br>  oh and i like rice milk best |`|0F8hauikaa	I use rice milk quite often. I'm not home to read the label so I'm not sure of the nutritional values. I like it because it doesn't have to be refrigerated until opened and it tastes pretty good. It's a little sweet so your kids might like it. Although I'm not actually a true vegan, I don't eat a lot of meat or dairy and I do eat a lot beans, whole wheat pasta, brown rice and fresh vegetables which are all filling and inexpensive. I found a website that might be helpful.|`|2RzEaod9aa	"I am on a very tight budget and it seems like a lot of the specialty foods are so expensive"<br>  <br>  That's right, the *specialty* foods are so expensive. Frozen vegetables/fruits, dried beans, grains, pasta, and breads are not. Sometimes, you can get frozen veggies/fruit for about a dollar a pound. It's a fabulous deal. Frozen is better than canned anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  "How can I go vegan without breaking the bank and still know I am giving my children all the vitamins they need?"<br>  <br>  I explained above how you can prevent breaking the bank. Now, you're going to hear opposition, so just listen to me carefully so you can better understand what's going on: people on omnivourous diets don't always get all the nutrition they need. Just because you eat more kinds of food (eggs, dairy, meat, and honey) doesn't mean that you're getting better nutrition. The obesity rates in the US are not mostly from vegans or vegetarians: the obesity rate is thanks to all the omnivores that don't know how to feed themselves properly and instead rely on McDonald's for a "well-balanced" meal of meat and fries.<br>  <br>  That being said, all you need to do is ensure that you're getting well-rounded nutrition for yourself and your children. You're going to be getting protein, minerals, vitamins, carbs, and fats from all-vegan sources...and that's what your body needs: well-rounded nutrition. The only difference between a vegan complete protein, like avocado, and a non-vegan complete protein, like milk, is that avocado is better absorbed by the body. They have the same amino acids, and the amino acids are all you need to repair cells. <br>  <br>  Ensure that you and your children have well-rounded diets. Again, frozen is going to be your best friend here. Buy fresh when it's cheap. Stores like Kroger's will put close-dated stuff on sale. I just bought tons of pre-packaged salads for only $1.49 each when they're normall over $3.00. Then I put them in a Green Bag so they wouldn't go bad as quickly (yes, the Debbie Meyer Green Bags do work). This way, you can buy the cheap stuff in bulk and not have to worry about it. I got 20 Green Bags for $9.99 by the way. <br>  <br>  As for Silk, ask yourself what milk means to you: milk means a source of protein, calcium, and vitamin D. If your kids really hate Silk, you can try other "milks" (rice, almond, hemp seed, etc.) or their chocolate milk, OR you can just feed them other foods that will provide protein, calcium, and vitamin D. I also learned that having them help you in the kitchen makes them more interested in the food. I blended silken tofu with a little soy milk with the help of a kid, and she was all about helping season it and dipping tortilla chips into it. She absolutely loved it! Have your kids help you in the kitchen, and also have them go to places like foodnetwork.com or vegan recipe sites and pick out foods to help you cook.  <br>  <br>  B12 can be found in brewer's yeast, which is vegan. Just add some to a smoothie and you're all set. |`|AA11173395	For vegans on a tight budget there is one simple rule: Avoid processed foods.  Buy produce, whole grains, dried beans, peas and lentils, (one bag makes a pot of soup for just pennies!) pasta, etc.<br>  <br>  I wood find a good children's multivitamin for your kids regardless of their being vegan.<br>  <br>  My son never cared for Sillk or the other soymilks.

It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. The tree is small and deciduous, reaching 3 to 12 metres (9.8 to 39 ft) tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown.[1] The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 cm long and 3–6 centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) broad on a 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 2.0 in) petiole with an acute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves. The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter. The fruit matures in autumn, and is typically 5 to 9 centimetres (2.0 to 3.5 in) diameter. The center of the fruit contains five carpels arranged in a five-point star, each carpel containing one to three seeds.[1]<br>  <br>  The tree originated from Central Asia, where its wild ancestor is still found today. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples resulting in range of desired characteristics. Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.[2]<br>  <br>  At least 55 million tonnes of apples were grown worldwide in 2005, with a value of about $10 billion. China produced about 35% of this total.[3] The United States is the second leading producer, with more than 7.5% of the world production.

AA10279616	Yes you can and it will turn out fine.  My favorite bread pudding was made with day old cinnamon rolls with a wonderful nutmeg sauce on top.|`|rCYIWvwraa	Once in a while, a question arises out of the depths of loveliness, such as this one, that puts me in a deep euphoric state.  Bread pudding, not only happens to be one of my favorite things to make, it is one of my favorite things to make for other people.  When people indulge into a lovely bread pudding, all negative energy, hateful thoughts, irritability, whining and constant complaining about life itself, ceases to exist.  Just complete happiness and fulfillment.<br>  If you have bread that is, or has, turned stale, you can turn them into delicious croutons for salads.  Cut them into medium size pieces (3/8 - 1/2 diameter).  Place cut bread pieces into a large bowl (large enough to contain, without overflowing), add minced garlic, 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of melted butter and extra virgin olive oil, fresh chopped basil, Italian flat leaf parsley, salt and white pepper.  All to taste, according to how much of each ingredient you prefer. Melted butter and olive mixture should be enough to coat bread pieces, without being to wet.  You could begin by coating about half the size of each bread piece.  Add all the ingredients into bowl with bread and toss with your hands.  Place bread pieces onto a sheet pan or cookie sheet evenly.  Making sure that no pieces are on top of each other.  Bake at 350*F until crispy, golden brown.  This is great for salads or as a snack. (Note: You can most definitely add other fresh herbs, such as thyme, oregano, sage, etc.)  Any combination you prefer.  Enjoy!<br>  As far as bread pudding is concerned.  Try to use a bread that is sweet, relatively light and fluffy in texture.  Such as a Portuguese sweet bread loaf, when making bread pudding.  If you want an awesome recipe, complete with an even more awesome sauce to go with it, email me.  It's a recipe that is very special to me.  But would love to share it with you.  Only if you share it with others.  Meet you in the kitchen.  <br>  The Jian.|`|0tXcfq0waa	OH I LOVE PUDDING BREAD!! ummm..maybe it'll turn out good i mean it is all still bread rite?? but you know, the BEST bread to use is Kaiser bread yuuuummmmmmmy!!! lol..hope this answers your question ;)|`|AA11786341	Bread Puddingscan be easily prepared with simple ingredients. <br>  French bread, wheat bread, any kind of bread can be used in a bread pudding recipe. Use old sweet rolls or doughnuts if you have some left at home. Use multigrain bread if you want added fiber and nutrition.

Another variation to the chocolate bread pudding is to use chocolate custard.

If you have a centrifugal juicer, as is most popular, you can put about anything through it, just realize some fruits you will need a lot of to make enough to drink.  Berries may be nice for flavor but you'd need a ridiculous amount of them to get a glass full.  I recommend using a base fruit that will produce a lot of juice like apple, orange, mango, peach, watermelon, or bananas (process them in a blender) and then add in a mix of berries, grapes, or another "base fruit" to create a nice flavor to the base.  Looking at bottles in the store is a great way to get ideas.  Feel free to visit my blog or website for more info.
bmoCpcdraa	The list coke<br>  1. Remove grease stains from clothing and fabric (I had to start there)<br>  2. Remove rust; methods include using fabric dipped in Coke, a sponge or even aluminum foil.<br>  3. Remove blood stains from clothing and fabric.<br>  4. Make gooey Coke funnel cakes .<br>  5. Clean oil stains from a garage floor; let the stain soak, hose off.<br>  6. Loosen a rusty bolt; pour on some Coke and wait for the magic to happen.<br>  7. Kill slugs and snails; a small bowl of Coke will attract them, the acid will kill them.<br>  8. Help a lawn become lush and green (see my lawn tonic article here )<br>  9. Prevent an asthma attack! Apparently, the caffeine in two 12oz cans can prevent the onset of an attack.<br>  10. Defrost a frozen windshield. Apply liberally and wait (I’ll see if this works in winter)<br>  11. Clean burnt pans; let the pan soak in the Coke, then rinse.<br>  12. Descale a kettle using the same method in 11.<br>  13. Neutralize a jellyfish sting.<br>  14. Clean car battery terminals by pouring a small amount of Coke over each one.<br>  15. Cure nausea; let a can of Coke go flat then take a teaspoon of Coke every hour.<br>  16. Also, flat coke can help relieve an upset stomach (aka “the runs”)<br>  17. Make a Mentos & Coke exploding fountain. This one takes a 2-liter bottle of Coke.<br>  <br>  18. Get rid of hiccups; gargle with a big mouthful of ice-cold Coke.<br>  19. Shake up a can and pour it over your windshield to remove bugs and other crud.<br>  20. Use the method in 19 for your car bumpers, too.<br>  21. Clean your engine; Coke distributors have been using this technique for decades.<br>  22. Relieve congestion; boil and a can of Coke and drink while hot to clear you up.<br>  23. Make a sweet BBQ sauce. Mix a can of Coke with ketchup and brush over ribs or chicken.<br>  24. Baste a ham roast with Coke as it cooks. The sugars will caramelize; the ham will be moist.<br>  25. Add a can of coke to your pot roast to tenderize it and add extra flavor. (Thanks Linsey).<br>  26. Make pretty pennies; soaking old pennies in Coke will remove the tarnish.<br>  27. Make your hair curly; pour flat Coke onto long hair, leave for a few minutes then rinse.<br>  28. Age documents and photos; for that antique look, apply Coke, pat with paper, leave to dry.<br>  29. Clean tile grout; pour onto kitchen floor, leave for a few minutes, wipe up.<br>  30. Mix a can of Coke with a packet of Italian seasoning; cook a tough steak in it.<br>  31. Make better compost; Coke increases the acidity, adds sugars and feeds microorganisms.<br>  32. Dissolve a tooth in it; Use a sealed container, this takes ages. Why would you want to though, unless you’re Hannibal Lecter?<br>  33. Remove gum from hair; dip into a small bowl of Coke, leave a few minutes. Gum will wipe off.<br>  34. Get silky skin; mix a spoonful of Coke with regular lotion and apply liberally.<br>  35. Make low-fat brownies .<br>  36. Pour a little in a cup and set it out an hour before a picnic, away from your site; it will attract wasps and bees so they’re not bugging you and your grub.<br>  37. Remove stains from vitreous china. More info on vitreous materials here .<br>  38. Got a dirty pool? Add two 2-liter bottles of Coke to clear up the water (it acts as rust remover).<br>  39. Add Coke to your laundry to remove bad smells, especially fish.<br>  40. Remove (or fade) dye from hair by pouring diet Coke over it.<br>  41. Mop a floor with Coke to make it sticky. It’s a movie industry trick to stop actors slipping.<br>  42. Remove marker stains from carpet. Apply Coke, scrub, then clean with soapy water.<br>  43. Clean a toilet; pour around bowl, leave for a while, flush clean.<br>  44. Apply to skin for a deep tan (although this seems like a recipe for skin cancer to me).<br>  45. Supposedly, drinking an 8oz can of Coke every day can prevent kidney stones.<br>  46. Add it to a Sloppy Joe mix<br>  47. Perk up your Azaleas or Gardenias.<br>  48. Coke and aluminum foil will bring Chrome to a high shine.<br>  49. Strip paint off metal furniture; soak a towel in Coke, sit it on the surface for days. Make sure you keep adding Coke to keep the towel wet. (Seems like a hassle, I’d rather buy paint stripper.).<br>  51. Drink it straight from the can, if you can (too sweet for me)<br>  <br>  And a few Coke fallacies:<br>  <br>      * Coke is not used by the authorities to clean blood from the roads after accidents.<br>      * Coke will not dissolve teeth or nails OVERNIGHT. It takes a long time.<br>      * Coke and aspirin will not get you high.<br>      * Coke is not an effective spermicide.<br>      * Coke poured onto raw pork will not cause worms to come crawling out of it.<br>      * The acids in Coke do not make it dangerous to drink (your own stomach acids are much stronger).<br>      * Drinking too much Coke will not make you die from CO2 poisoning.<br>      * Coke does not contain cocaine (although it used to).<br>      * Coke did not become carbonated by accident.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read more: "51 uses for Coca-Cola – the ultimate list. | Wise Bread" - <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/51-uses-for-coca-cola-%E2%80%93-the-ultimate-list#ixzz09IszWJHH" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisebread.com/51-uses-for-coc...</a>|`|xnBbmCkCaa	No, of course not.

The lemon juice helps the chicken stay juicy.  The olive oil helps the marinade do its job.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I never use an exact recipe.  I just throw it together.  It always comes out great.|`|AA10928232	I just salt and pepper it and throw it on the propane grill outside.  If I'm out of propane, like now, I'll use an indoor grill pan on the gas stove.

It's best for 18 hours or so, in the fridge.... makes it very tender and juicy.|`|AA11786341	Mediterranean Chicken Recipe<br>  <br>  This dish is excellent served over a bed of couscous.<br>  <br>  Prep time: 15 Minutes     <br>  Cook time: 20 Minutes <br>   Servings: 4  <br>  <br>  <br>  1 1/4 lb. boned, skinned chicken thighs <br>  1/3 c kalamata olives <br>  1/3 c dried apricots <br>  1/3 c dry vermouth <br>  2 Tbs capers, drained <br>  2 Tbs orange juice <br>  1 Tbs white wine vinegar <br>  2 tsp dried basil <br>  2 tsp olive oil <br>  2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed <br>  3 Tbs packed brown sugar <br>  Directions<br>  Rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 1 inch pieces. <br>  Please all ingredients (except brown sugar) in a 9 x 13 inch bakind dish. <br>  Mix well and spread out evenly. <br>  Bake uncovered at 500 degrees F for 15 minutes. <br>  Turn oven on broil. <br>  Sprinkle chicken with brown sugar and broil 6 inches from heat for about 5 minutes.|`|AA11122479	marinade in either italian salad dressing or lemon juice and A1 steak sauce over night. drain off and throw away the marinade and either cook in oven at 300 oven for 30-60 minutes depending on how  much your cooking or grill on an outdoor grill. in a hurry? sprinkle chicken with lemon pepper seasoning. place a pan of water on the second rack in oven and and the chicken on top rack. the evaporating water will keep the chicken tender. you can also throw in some veggies with the chicken. cut into chucks and coat in olive oil and any seasoning you like (garlic works great) stir the veggies every 5-10 minutes or so. you don't have to use much olive oil. a little bit goes a long way

It was pretty watery and not high on carbonation, but it got us so drunk that we were seeing double, sitting by the campfire.  That was a good time.|`|y9CgveCGaa	Dominion brewery makes something called "Hop Pocket Pils"  I don't know if it is exotic, but, I've never tasted anything else like it.|`|6qngoElyaa	Dortmunder,,,, DAB!!!!|`|JvzgVc0Iaa	The monk made beers.|`|jsUE73TXaa	How do you define exotic beer exactly?  I've drank beer from just about everywhere except Africa.  I like Kingfisher, which is Indian beer, but only the Kingfisher they sell in the States.  The Kingfisher they have over in India tastes like Old English.  They also have something called Royal Challenge in India.  The challenge is to see if you can keep it down!  I like Japanese beer a lot.  Kirin and Asahi are both good.  Both of those you can get in the States.  In Costa Rica they have Imperial, Bavaria, and Pilsen, all good beers, and they have some interesting ones in Venezuela.  If you like German beer, Lowenbrau is the best (that you can get in the states, other than seasonals).  There is an awesome Belgian beer called Chimay.  It's expensive, but very stout.<br>  <br>  Like I was saying, it depends on what you consider exotic.  In my opinion, vanilla port or chocolate double stout are exotic.|`|a261ce06211df3c4e540ab06aacee02aaa	Id have to name 2 of them<br>  one is a Belgian monastery brew called "ORVAL": very interesting and exotic even there<br>  the other is Dogfish Heads "Midas Touch" its an ancient Egyptian recipe.<br>  Cheers|`|CBUHaFHaaa	personally I like to stick to the normal!<br>  <br>  drink some corona with some lime and salt.<br>   <br>  does the trick for me:)<br>  <br>  exotic enough? haha

No matter what you should eat at least 1200 calories a day to prevent your body from going into starvation mode.  Adding protein (like kidney beans) to your lunch salad is wise, and low fat ranch is better than ff ranch because you need a little fat in your diet to absorb all the vitamins that the veggies have.  Try a frozen veggie burger for some more protein (like Boca burger's vegan patties), and maybe a handful of almonds as an additional snack.  At the end of the day you need to make sure you are consuming enough whole grain carbohydrates and animal-free protein in your diet, not solely vegetables and fruit.

74ME7h3waa	A long island ice tea might be your best bet.  It doesn't have the burn of alcohol and will get you very buzzed after about 2 glasses.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, alcohol is an acquired taste.  When I first started drinking I hated beer, I had to seriously choke it down.  Then I discovered taking shots.  I would take shots of vodka and chase it with something like gatorade.  I used to could just take shot after shot, with a chaser.  Then I got really sick off of vodka and haven't been able to drink it since...so be careful.  After that I haven't really been able to shoot liquor quite as well, so then I began to drink whiskey and coke.  Crown and coke is probably the best I've found so far, but I used to drink Rich and Rare whiskey with coke just because it was so cheap and still didn't taste too bad.  And throughout all of those experiences I would drink beer here and there and now I have an acquired taste for it and I think that it tastes great now.|`|up6gtvvyaa	In general you can probably find lots of them if you experiment. The trick is to use mixers that are similar in flavor to the booze you have, or that will mask it well. Any juice with a slightly bitter taste will mask the alchohol flavor itself. Some to try...<br>  <br>  gin and grapefruit pop (the sweet fizzy one)<br>  gin or vodka and tonic (with lime)<br>  dark rum and coke/pepsi<br>  rye and gingerale<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|08923c2c52b9b7419814bbd2ee912d38aa	Well there are lots of things out there so it's all just a matter of opinion really.

I think that is wrong: if we all focus on one of the many problems of this world then what is to stop us making the world a better place? We cannot focus on everything: world starvation, pollution, deforestation, racism, overpopulation. We can only focus on so many, but who is to say that this won't make a difference.<br>  <br>  You might think it, even though you don't really care about it- you are saving 36 pigs, 36 sheep, 750 chickens and turkeys.<br>  <br>  So it doesn't really matter whether you are doing it for your health or for the animals: you are still helping.

There is NO substitute for pure water,there is not any kind of drink in the world that does the most for your body than water. Now , if you are only consuming just one glass of water a day I would suggest to you to drink no more than 2 1/2 glasses a day more for a week or week and a half to start. Then you will be able to increase your intake by about 1 more glass a day for the next week, and so on until you have attained the optimum amount of 1/2 oz. of water per pound of body weight a day.<br>  <br>   Warning!    If you drink too much to start you can make yourself very sick, too much of a shock to your body.So , go easy to start.

That water can actually come from a variety of sources.  In fact, most of it is in the food you eat, let alone the beverages you drink.<br>  <br>  The "64 oz" rule is based on a 2,000 calorie diet.  If you consume a lot more calories, you'll need a lot more fluids.  Things like milk, juice, and tea will usually count.  But anything with a lot of sugar, caffeine or alcohol will not.

Not to mention if I get up too quickly I get really dizzy. But I've never drank a lot of liquid throughout my entire life and I've been like this for the last few years.

AA12185092	A shot of vodka is the same alcohol hit whether you mix it or not. Drinking mixed drinks tends to slow down your consumption rate, and also reduces dehydration, so you tend not to get as drunk. You also miss that flush you can get from rapidly consuming straight spirits.|`|OVs6rWswaa	No it does not change the alcohol content of the booze of choice. 90 proof Whiskey is still 90 Proof.<br>  <br>  The additives only change the taste. If you mix a quart of Vodka with a quart of orange juice when you pour a drink it sitll has the same proof.<br>  <br>  You will get just as drunk if you drink a straight pint of vodka as you will if you mix it with any thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|TzZnsjquaa	It doesn't actually change the potency of the alcohol, it just decreases the amount of alcohol in ratio to total liquid. If you have 10 mL of an alcoholic beverage which is 50% alcohol (this is a rare percentage, but it makes my example's math easy) and you add 10 mL of a non-alcoholic beverage, you're still going to be drinking 5 mL of alcohol, there will just also be 15 mL of not-alcohol with it instead of 5.|`|kQcvnhdSaa	If you had a 25ml measure of whisky at 40% ABV it would be twice as strong as 25ml of whiskey and 25ml of water mixed. This would give you 20% ABV, but you would still have the same total amount of alcohol in the glass (10ml)|`|JvzgVc0Iaa	The alcohol remains the same but the drinks alcohol concentration is reduced so yes it does make it weaker.|`|FMpPWqnHaa	yes i think|`|aTRMObTZaa	If you have a half glass of liquor and top it up with coke, then YES, that drink is going to be weaker than a full glass of just liquor.<br>  <br>  The chemical makeup of juice, coke and other mixers does not affect the potency of the liquor you're using.

61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	Yes, aluminum is generally safe.  <br>  <br>  However, cast iron is iron not aluminum.<br>  <br>  Edit... Let me clarify a little more.<br>  <br>  Aluminum (as well as cast iron) are meant for cooking and not storage.  Also, the advice is to avoid cooking acidic foods.  Aluminum is a little more resistant to acids, but still should be kept to a minimum.<br>  <br>  In regards to Alzhiemer and Aluminum... that link has been debunked a while back.  The original study that showed the aluminum link was flawed.  Aluminum was a contaminant in the dye used to stain the samples so it lead to an incorrect result.<br>  <br>  However, junk science still push the Aluminum and Alzheimer link.|`|AAoQzU7oaa	i have read in the past that aluminum will leach into the food.<br>  <br>  we have replaced with cast iron or stainless steel.|`|D3rw1C8faa	Aluminum is not good to cook in.  It leaches aluminum into your food and the aluminum is stored in your brain.  Aluminum causes Alzheimers and memory loss.  Use cast iron (it releases iron and it is good for your) or modern pots and pans.  <br>  Get rid of aluminum.  That is why you see it at sales all the time.

AA12066269	If you like a good rare steak, tuna would be a good start. It has a similar texture to raw beef and very good  If you like lox on a bagel, salmon sushi is good (Crispy salmon hand roll is really really good)  If you aren't too sure about eating raw fish try Inari, Shrimp, or California Roll.<br>  <br>  Many people eat sushi with chopstix but it is ok to eat it with your fingers as they do in Japan.  Also when dipping into soy sauce you should only dip the fish side in, not the rice or it will fall apart in the soy sauce.  Most Americans don't know this though|`|HI0oQriqaa	i would say stay away from raw fish . you're asking for food poisoning.|`|4a3de9c591559d23061285bbb4b01257aa	Try the rice rolls.  California Rolls are very popular.  It's crab meat with cucumber in the rice roll, and it's not scary at all.<br>  <br>  Usually they'll give you edamame, ginger and/or wasabi on the side.  Edamame is soy beans.  They're tasty.  I like to dip mine in soy sauce, but that's probably a weirdo thing to do.  Ginger is weird, if you're not used to it.  And wasabi is SUPER spicy with a horseradish-like flavor.<br>  <br>  And definitely get the miso soup.  Very yummy.|`|6uCCu1R3aa	cucumber and avocado rolls are a good first start, maybe a tempura roll since the fish is cooked.|`|8e15Ty5faa	California roll|`|AA11786341	California roll|`|MUbbzN17aa	I like the philadelphia roll, it's crab meat, cream cheese, and cucumber rolled in nori (seaweed) and rice.  But I love a lot of varieties of sushi, it's ok to ask the chef what you should start with, tell them you're new.  Wasabi (the green stuff you can put on it) has a bite to it, but its an addictive sensation, you may want to be careful with how much you use.|`|IikDr2Elaa	I recommend not starting with raw fish because sushi has such a different taste than most everyday kind of food. I like California Rolls, and Avocado Rolls or Cucumber Rolls for a more simple flavor. Raw fish may really shock your taste buds, but if you have to go raw I recommend Spicy Tuna Rolls or regular Tuna Rolls.|`|qFGPYSTFaa	California roll is the most popular.  I don't like it though.  It has no raw fish.  Get tuna rolls, its raw tuna, wasabi and rice, if you've never had raw tuna before, its nothing like you would expect.  It's very good.<br>  <br>  Sushimi (spelled similarly at least)  Is just a chunk of raw fish, and is also very good.<br>  <br>  The little slivers of pink stuff you get with it, is pickled ginger.  It's used to clean the pallet between diff. types or something like that.|`|871DrzY9aa	Definatly the Californian roll.<br>  It doesn't have any raw fish in it but crab instead.<br>  It's a pretty safe one to start with :)|`|N0EEYQUnaa	ANYTHING!

v7XLArZraa	the veggie delight|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yes! They make custom salads exactly how you tell them to make it. They should have the following vegetables available: lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, olives, bell peppers, jalapenos, banana peppers, onions, cucumbers, pickles, and sometimes carrots and other things. They have a few types of dressing: vinegar and oil, ranch, sweet onion, vinaigrette, sandwich condiments if you like those in your salad, and maybe others. And usually 3 types of cheese to pick from but it depends totally on which Subway you go to (ask them what cheese they have). Some Subways have a "veggie max" which is a meatless thing kind of like a veggie burger. You can put any combination of vegetables and cheese and dressing in a sandwich also, and choose between 5 or 6 kinds of bread. Oh also some Subways have pizzas which are really good and you can put any veggies you want on them, and they cook in about 60 seconds!<br>  <br>  It's not "processed crap" like somebody else said. The vegetables are fresh, they cut them and then stick them in the fridge, except for the olives and pickles and banana peppers, of course those aren't fresh. The bread comes frozen and they bake them behind the counter. They aren't supposed to give wilted old veggies, so ask them to get you fresh ones, or talk to the owner if they do that.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Probably but there must be better salad somewhere.  I try not to look at the veggies when they make my subs.  Seeing them pick through the frozen and brown stuff  to find something decent is not reassuring.  If it wasn't for the mounds of meat and sauces I would not eat there.|`|ubukt8WWaa	Subway is a great choice.  You can do sandwiches or salads.  <br>  <br>  For a sandwich, you can start with cheese, decide whether you want it toasted, then get a bunch of veggies put on it.  It's almost like a little salad bar.  They are all there in front of you and you can say, "a little  this, a little that".  Included are cucumbers, black olives, baby spinach, green peppers, pickled spicy peppers, along with the usual sandwich veggies -- lettuce, tomato, etc.  You can even get avocado on it for a little extra (the other veggies are free),  Then you choose what type of dressing you want on the sandwich.  They have a few kinds of vinaigrette along with the usual mayo and mustard.<br>  <br>  Many Subways also have veggie patties.

You just have to ask.<br>  <br>  But it is NOT vegetarian friendly.<br>  <br>  A Sandwich Artist goes from touching meats to cheeses and vegetables constantly, so almost all the food could be contaminated. <br>  <br>  If your sandwich is toasted, it is cooked in the same toaster that meats are heated in, and therefore contaminated. <br>  <br>  Also, who knows what sandwich that knife just cut. The one he's using to slice your veggie delite could've just cut into a BMT. <br>  <br>  Behind the scenes, the bins that contain all of the vegetables previously could've contained a various array of meats and may or may not have been cleaned properly.<br>  <br>  So depending on how clean the store is, and how concerned you are, Subway may or may not be vegetarian safe.<br>  <br>  It's better to just not take chances.|`|XoAavDz8aa	You can have a salad made with anything you want.

I don't know if other Subways are any different, but I know at the last three Subways I've worked at we offer a salad which has the following:<br>  <br>  1) Lettuce, spinach, or both<br>  2) Any meat of your choice (or none - the deal is, you can make any 6" sub into a salad instead ... so for you, you'd ask for a Veggie Delite salad)<br>  3) Any vegetables you would like on the salad<br>  4) Any sauce you would like, and you can get it on the sandwich or on the side in a little cup, if you don't want it to get soggy<br>  5) Croutons<br>  <br>  You can also get the following at many Subways:<br>  <br>  1) Apple slices<br>  2) Yogurt<br>  3) Milk<br>  4) Veggie Delite Sandwich (Sandwich with no meat, just veggies<br>  5) Some of the soups may be vegetarian ... I know for a fact we serve a few soups that have no meat - my coworker was joking about how if I were Catholic, I could always eat the tuna or crab meat on Friday (during Lent) and my manager, thinking that I really was Catholic, interrupted and said, "you can get the soup, it's meat-free"<br>  6) Our Subway doesn't have them, but some Subways may or may not still have the Veggie Patty, which is like a veggie burger kind of thing ... I don't like them, but my coworkers who were Indian and adhered to a meatless diet LOVED them. <br>  <br>  One more thing: as for the comment about sandwich artists using the same gloves/knives/etc. ... you can always ask the sandwich artist to wash his/her hands and put on new gloves, and you can also ask for a new knife from the back - people who adhere to certain religions do it. As for the part about the containers having once had meat in them, that is true, but really all containers go through a 3-step washing process: washed in soapy hot water in one sink, then rinsed in a second sink, then sanitized using a special solution in a third sink. And with the toaster, well, I think any meat that did perchance get on the inside of the toaster would be burned, crispified, and fall to the bottom : ) <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!

nzKGyadWaa	What's the weather like? Grill hot dogs, serve with chips and cookies and lemonade. Play outside games like volleyball, croquet or Bocci - or have a bean bag toss at a target. If you want some ideas for inside games - have you ever played "Honey I love you but I just can't laugh."?  People sit in a circle on chairs. One person is "it". They are in the middle of the circle. They pick a person, crawl over to them (not walk), look them in the face and say "Honey, if you love me, laugh." They can laugh, make faces but they can't touch the other person. The person they choose has to answer with a straight face "Honey, I love you but I just can't laugh."  If they succeed then "it" has to pick someone else. They are in the middle till someone smiles or laughs when they answer. Then that person is "it". The game can get hilarioius if people are willing. Or play the card game "spoons". (We played it once with forks - don't recommend that.) Make personal pizzas - have everybody decorate their own, and then vote on the most creative.  There's also "Murder".  Everyone draws a slip of paper and doesn't show it to anyone else. One person has a dot on their paper. That person is the murderer. If he catches your eye and winks at you - you're dead. You don't have to announce that right away, but within a few minutes you have to announce "I'm dead." In the meantime the guests left alive are trying to figure out who the murderer is. If they think they have it they shout "I accuse .....". If they are wrong, they are out. If they are right, they've won the game.  This game is best played with a bunch of people.  These are very cheap games. We played them in college back when I ran with a creative but totally poor crowd.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	just hang with your friends at the house. get a cake and ice cream and have fun!|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	You can plan out a whole murder mystery party and have a bunch of people come and get into it! <br>  You can all dress fancy and then try to solve who died, who the killer was, etc!<br>  It should cost you minimal amounts if you do it at home and if you only buy food for everyone!|`|AKtLAbsOaa	do a car rally (when you go around town and do a scavenger hunt. i.e.: go to Nordstrom and ask a sales clerk in the juniors department what an upcoming trend is and have them write it down and sign the paper for you)!

Oranges are one of the most popular fruit and they are they make the most popular juice.<br>  <br>  There are many varieties of oranges to pick from. There are Navel, red navel, valencia, hamlin, pineapple, temple, moro and ambersweet. Navel oranges are the most popular to eat while Valencia oranges are often used to make orange juice.<br>   <br>  <br>  The bottom of a navel orange looks like a bellybutton or a navel which is where the name came from. The navel is a smaller fruit attached to the main orange. You can see this smaller fruit every time you peel and separate a navel orange. As the smaller part of the fruit grows the navel on the orange becomes bigger.<br>  <br>  Oranges are filled with disease phytochemicals. These substances , such as flavornoids, which are found in oranges, act as antioxidants and may protect against heart disease.<br>  <br>  Christopher Columbus was is thought to be the first person to bring orange seeds and seedlings to the new world on his second voyage in 1493<br>  <br>  In 1873 three navel orange trees were brought from Brazil and planted in Riverside, California. The trees started producing fruit in 1878. Today, one of the three original trees is still alive and producing fruit.<br>  <br>  Orange trees are evergreens, seldom exceeding 30 feet in height. The leaves are oval and glossy and the flowers are white and fragrant.<br>  <br>  Three essential oils are obtained from oranges: Oil of orange, obtained from the rind of the fruit and used principally as a flavoring agent. Oil of petitgrain, obtained from the leaves and twigs and used in perfumery. Oil of neroli, obtained from the blossoms and used in flavorings and perfumes.<br>  <br>  Oranges are rated #1 on nutrition among five popular fruits and are among the healthiest items in the produce section that provides valuable health benefits.<br>  <br>  In 1895 a freeze produced a major set back in production.

Granted, upon opening a bottle your senses will be overcome with a strong smell of fishy algae aroma. However, taken with a yummy glass of vanilla soymilk or apple juice you will have the deed done in under a minute. Or, if you prefer, you can do a powder form and mix it in your favorite juice but either way, you will benefit greatly from 3-5 grams of this harmless, natural green plant for a delicious energy boost, weight management and in addition to this and feeling fantastic, your body will receive nutrients that are powerful for health and longevity.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes spirulina is good for health it is full of vitamins and nutrients, great if you are low on energy. I take it every day. Only drawback it smells like fish food, (but it is fed to fish). Also wheatgrass is as good, maybe even better but is more expensive. <br>  <br>  The richest source of proteins, it provides 18 out of 22 amino acids the body needs. <br>  Its range of B-Vitamins strengthens the immune system and builds resistance. Its natural beta carotene (pro Vitamin A) helps maintain normal and healthy eyesight. <br>  It provides iron in a form that is easily absorbed. It helps maintain an optimum level of hemoglobin in the blood.|`|qFCQmKyAaa	Spirulina is really great for you, it detoxes your blood, is one of the most nutritionally dense things you can eat and is 60% protein, go ahead and google around it is such an amazing thing for you to consume, it should also strengthen your immune system and make colds and flues less terrible or not show up at all.<br>  jc, <br>  Chill man, all I can say is stick to nature as close as possible and avoid all the processed synthetic ingredients and chemicals in "food", spirulina is good because it contains way more vitamins and other nutrients than any synthetic multivitamin, thats why spirulina is good, don't mix it with anything soda-y, just water, juices or smoothies. Im curious as to what the FDA has pulled off the shelves at Whole Foods, can yuo recall any products by name? just curious. Thanks! :D<br>  jc, <br>  Well those are all contaminants, it can happen to any product, I meant like a supplement meant for nutritional purposes being pulled off the market after being declared the nutrients aren't safe or something like that, nutritional products are not dangerous and show very positive results if you take enough.

I think they will eventually get soggy no matter what you do especially if they were fried. Fried foods do not last long and retain their taste well unless frozen. That's the best advice I can give is to freeze it.

racnq84Vaa	A sandwich made with whole grain bread and loaded with veggies and lean meat and cheese is tasty and will keep just fine with ice like I describe below.<br>  <br>  If you just cannot live without a hot meal then go to your local army surplus store and purchase some MRE's.  They have a heat pack and do not need refrigeration.<br>  <br>  <br>  I often travel and purchased an insulated lunch bag made to hold 6 to eight soda cans.  I fill ziploc bags (quart sized) with water and set them in a bowl while freezing to catch any water that might drip.  They last longer than the blue ice packs.  In fact, when I place on in my bag at 7 am and return home at 11 pm on my day trips for work, the bag still contains ice and any remaining food is still cold.  And I live in South Texas where the car gets hot.  And my bag stays in the car.  I also will toss a bottle or two of frozen bottled water.  If it does thaw out completely, I have water to drink.  But it rarely thaws completely.  <br>  <br>  You could also bring a thick towel and wrap the lunch bag in the towel for added insulation.<br>  <br>  This method allows me to not only take healthy sandwiches and fruit but to carry other tasty fare.  Like pasta salad with seafood or chicken.  Yogurt.  Wraps made with spinach and other greens as the outer shell and carrots, onions, bell pepper, lean meat, cheese, etc rolled up inside with various dipping sauces that you can find recipes for all over the internet.  Hard Boiled eggs (good for you).  Salads.  For a treat, mashed beans of my choosing with no fat or lard added and seasoned to taste- makes a nutritious bean dip that is full of nutrients and I find veggie chips that are made with real veggies and baked.  <br>  <br>  Dried fruit and nuts are great for snacking and a great thing to add in place of chips or pretzels.  And they are good for you.  Just do not buy dried fruit that is processed with sugar.  You can find tasty dried fruit that is just fruit at most grocers.<br>  <br>  You do not have to have hot food to be healthy.  Just food that is nutritious.   Have your hot meal before you leave for work and when you get home.  And do what many people do everyday and eat a delicious cold lunch brought from home and created with your wonderful imagination and filled with nutrition.<br>  <br>  If you work using a computer, you can find usb lunch bags and containers on line that keep your food hot or cold depending on which you purchase by simply being plugged into your computer.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	fruit, nuts, pb&j sandwich. I really do not get why the ice pak did not work. It should if you kept everything in an insulated lunch bag for these tye of circumstances. this should not be a big deal.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Get some ice packs to put in an insulated lunch box and you can keep everything that can be refrigerated--yogurt, fresh fruits, raw veggies, hummus, lunch meats and condiments.  Ice packs can be made at home if you don't have one or want to buy them.  Just get a ziplock bag (preferably freezer safe because they're thicker) and fill it halfway with water and freeze it.  When it's frozen, put it into another ziplock to prevent leaking.  It'll stay frozen most of the day and keep everything cold enough not to spoil.<br>  <br>  As for specific foods, how about lunch meat sandwiches, apples, bananas, carrots and celery with ranch dressing, vegetable salads, pasta salads, bean salads, crackers and peanut butter, hummus and chips, salsa.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I don't know , but dog food is made from dry food that we don't eat from animals

ubukt8WWaa	The % sugar does not translate directly into % alcohol.  15% alcohol is a high goal.  If you dumped in enough sugar in the beginning, that leads to problems.  The high sugar concentration can actually interfere with fermentation. You'll need to add extra sugar gradually during the fermentation process to boost alcohol that high.<br>  <br>  Here's an article that might be helpful:  <a href="http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-high-alcohol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-high-...</a>|`|dXCjX2bFaa	who cares its alcahol<br>  but i think so|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	I can understand why you are having trouble. You are jumping into this without knowing what you are doing. Try reading Papazian on beer and Berry on wine.<br>  <br>  For example, you don't use cane sugar and water in the same recipe. Cane sugar is added to wine must. If you add it to beer, you get a cidery taste. Water is added to the wort for beer. Add it to wine and you will just make the wine thinner. You also don't use bakers' yeast if you have any idea of what you are doing. That would give you lots of carbon dioxide, very little alcohol, and an "oiff" taste.

sMTVcfiVaa	Interesting question! Fungus is in its own kingdom, so it's not an animal technically. Yes, it feeds off of animal by products, but so do most plants.

Place the sandwich on a plate and press with your hand to flatten the sandwich.<br>  Having the jelly between the two layers of peanut butter helps keep the jelly from leaking through the bread when you smash it.  You can add sliced banana for a variation but then it should not be smashed.|`|IikDr2Elaa	I am a PB and J pro. I personally like crunchy peanut butter best, dont go organic though because it has a much thinner consistency and in my opinion is really gross. Use whole wheat/whole grain or some kind or wheat like regular or honey, because plain white bread has much less flavor and the combination of peanut butter and whole grains is great. The flavor of jelly depends on your taste preferences, but the best kind of any flavor is the pure fruit preserves. Bluberry preserves are a new alternative to grape jelly, and strawberry or any kind of berry preserves are good. use at least 2 tbsp of peanut butter and make sure to cover one slice. spread the jelly on the other slice and just put them together. Cut the sandwich diagnolly because sandwiches always taste better in triangles. Last step is to enjoy! It tastes espescially good with a glass of skim milk.|`|2uFMBCk8aa	Get Bread Slices.<br>  Get Peanut Butter.<br>  Get Jelly.<br>  Get Knife, put in Peanut Butter, and spread on Bread.<br>  Get Spoon, put in Jelly, and spread on Bread.<br>  Put Bread Slices together, and place in mouth.|`|4EZ7sTEJaa	take 2 pieces of bread<br>  take some peanut butter<br>  take some jelly<br>  smash it in the bread<br>  <br>  voila!|`|CmVNgEmeaa	ewwww.  yea its like way hard i cant do it.  <br>  <br>  <br>  ps.<br>  like OMG|`|RCgWKjkPaa	LOL i really really really really hope this is a joke<br>  if not than wow... just sad|`|K4GIv4LLaa	eat **** instead thats wat I do

It's all alcohol and you're just drunk.<br>  <br>  The effects depend on your mood and the situation, not the beverage. Anyone claiming otherwise is fooling themselves, the alcohol goes into your blood and into your brain. Everything else is digested and has very little effect on how you react or feel or what mood you're in. An angry drunk is just an angry drunk, not drunk on anger-inducing whisky or rum or whatever.

They would then fill bottles with some of the alcohol, some water to dilute it, and some juniper berry juice, to make is smell like gin.<br>  It was called bathtub gin because that was the only tap in most houses the bottles would fit under.    <br>  It tasted horrible, and many cocktails were developed in order to mask the taste.<br>  People who drank poorly made bathtub gin could get sick, go blind, or even die.

Mix together Crisco and lard in metal bowl. Sprinkle with flour mixture. Chill in refrigerator for 15 minutes. Remove butter from freezer and slice into 1/2 inch chunks. Add to bowl. Work butter and shortenings together into flour with fingers or a pastry blender, leaving large chunks, the size of walnuts. The purpose is to coat the butter particles with flour, but not to allow the butter or shortenings to melt. Do not overwork the mixture.<br>  <br>  Add the lemon juice or vinegar to ice water and stir quickly into dry ingredients. Mix briefly, less than 45 seconds, leave large unincorporated pockets of butter and shortening. If mixture is beginning to melt, refrigerate briefly.<br>  <br>  Gather mixture together into a flat disc, approximately 1 inch thick, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour or up to 2 days. Freeze if you want to reserve longer than 2 days. The half hour rest is necessary so that the dough will become easier to roll out. The buttermilk powder and/or lemon juice also helps relax the dough and prevent gluten, which can make for a tough crust.<br>  <br>  NOTE: For a flakier pie crust, reserve 1/3 stick of butter and slice lengthwise, 1/8 inch thick. Place strips of butter onto dough and then fold into thirds before refrigerating for half hour resting period.<br>  <br>  For the filling, use a combination of different types of apples. The best combination consists of mostly Granny Smith apples and a few Cortland types. The Granny Smith apples retain their shape when cooked and provide tartness and flavor. Meanwhile, the Cortland apples cook down into applesauce.<br>  <br>  Mix the nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon with the sugar. Sprinkle the sugar with a few drops of pure vanilla extract. Work the butter and 2 Tablespoons flour or other thickener into the sugar. Slice the apples into thin wedges and place apples into pre-rolled out and fitted pie crust, packing apples in tightly, since they will cook down significantly. Mound apples higher in center. Sprinkle over the apples the juice of 1/2 lemon, then sprinkle the sugar-spice mixture over the apples evenly.<br>  <br>  Roll out and place top crust, fluting edges to seal tightly and creating several vent holes to allow steam to escape.<br>  <br>  Brush top of crust with a mixture of one egg white and one tablespoon of water or with a little cream. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.<br>  <br>  Variation: One method of making a nice base for your apple pie is to peel a portion of the apples, placing the skins, cores, lemon peels, cinnamon sticks, and fresh grated ginger, into a saucepan with sugar and half cup of water or apple juice. Simmer over low heat for about an hour and strain, reserving the liquid. Thicken 1/2 cup of the strained liquid with 1-2 tsp cornstarch or arrowroot and cool. Add 1/4 tsp vanilla, the sliced and peeled apples, and pour into the pie shell. This is a nice variation when you don't have cortland apples to mix in with the granny smiths because it keeps the pie from being too dry. The liquid is enough for one 10-inch pie about 4 inches tall at center. Adjust according to your pie size.<br>  <br>  Bake about 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.<br>  <br>  =======<br>  Gramma's Apple Pie<br>  Filling: <br>  1 cup sugar <br>  2 tablespoons flour <br>  1 tablespoon ground cinnamon <br>  1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg <br>  6 tart apples, cored, peeled and cut into chunks <br>  1 tablespoon butter <br>  For the filling: mix the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg with apples and set aside. <br>  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br>  Pinch dough around the edges to seal it.

That was their 2nd biggest blunder.<br>  Their 1st biggest blunder was in the 1920's when Pepsi( quite new) was struggling and offered Coke to buy them out( for peanuts).<br>  the Coke execs thought( at that time) Pepsi wasn't a threat and never would be and decided to refuse the deal.<br>  If they would have bought Pepsi out, Coke would have dominated the World.<br>  Since then Pepsi has been a thorn in their side.<br>  <br>  Linda B.<br>  First came Dr.Pepper, then came Coke.<br>  Dr, Pepper was introduced one year before Coke.<br>  <br>  The exact date of Dr Pepper's conception is unknown, but the U.S. Patent Office recognizes December 1, 1885 as the first time Dr Pepper was served. It was introduced nationally in the United States at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition as a new kind of cola, made with 23 flavors. Dr Pepper was far from being the first carbonated soft drink, or even the first soft drink in the United States for that matter. Vernors Ginger Ale and Hires Root Beer share the title for first American-born soft drink, both debuting in 1866.

b2261d1342601255ca19eb8cac0fdf39aa	Veganism can be hard at times but usually is pretty easy, with so many options out there it is not difficult. I personally am a freegan which means (at least too me others have other opinions) I will not buy any animal products but I do dumpster dive or trash pick them meaning they are being thrown out and I am not contributing to their deaths I am sort of reusing it in a way! Honestly the best thing to do is take it slow and easy, start by lets say giving up eggs and then milk and cheese and so on. Though always check ingredients and for things like pizza order it without cheese (and make sure the crust is vegan, which mostly it is though sometimes they add cheese to it) or with a burrito get it with out cheese or sour cream and a lot of places now have Soy Milk (I was at the smithsonian about a year or so ago too chill after a protest of some sort on the mall and they had soy milk) and I am finding a lot more places have it now. I would also learn how to cook, it can be a lot of fun and a great for you because lets say you want seitan chick'n in a marsala cream sauce (using soy milk or other vegan milk and nutritional yeast) you can make it yourself and be proud of what you did and make what you want when you want. It can also impress friends and family and can provide you with skills to start a career in cooking later in life which can win big points!<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy eating and remember nobody is perfect and if you "slip up" it happens.|`|MzXkWx0Iaa	just try your best. but you cannot call your self a vegan, if you eat dairy on weekends. its not that hard to be vegan. you can get good soy and rice ice cream in the grocery store!<br>  good luck!|`|mzz9Icdjaa	you can't be a part-time vegan if that's what you're thinking about doing. that would be vegetarian. But if you do decide to go vegan, just make sure you're getting enough calcium (since you're giving up dairy) so eat lots of dark, leafy greens like spinach. you can get the protein from beans and tofu|`|7857ce4d05df69a811cf2ac828f90172aa	Good for you that you are making this connection early on! I didn't turn vegetarian until I was two years older than you, and not vegan till three years ago.<br>  I went through what you are going through, I understand you are worried about it.<br>  But you can't be vegan some of the time. See the word vegetarian refers to a diet of not eating meat, but veganism is an entire lifestyle. We don't eat anything that has had any sort of connection with any animal abuse, not even on weekends!<br>  <br>  Listen, don't worry about these terms right now, just do what YOU think is right! If that includes eating dairy sometimes then that is entirely your choice, but you cannot call yourself a vegan. You see if you call yourself a vegan and people see you eating milk products, then they will either think that you are a hypocrite (if they know what a vegan is) or think that vegans eat animal products (if they don't know what a vegan is.) Trust me, ALL vegans have had someone come up to them and offer them egg or dairy and then say they met a "vegan" who ate them. It's simply not fair on real vegans for people to do that, it means we have to explain what a vegan really is, and potentially insult their psudo-vegan friend accidently and there re bad feelings all around.<br>  You might be a vegan one day, and when this happens to you you'll agree that it's not a term that should be thrown around lightly!<br>  <br>  I think you should do some more reading. Some good books are "Becoming Vegan" and "Vegan Freaks" These will give you a good idea of what veganism involves and what it is like to really be a vegan.<br>  <br>  good luck!

It has been commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen. Gelatin is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is in almost every "gummy" confectionery as well as other products such as marshmallows and some low-fat yogurt. Some dietary customs forbid the use of gelatin from animal sources, and medical issues may limit or prevent its consumption by certain people.|`|233bbb5ff35324aa581bb39605c0d28daa	no, and it can be found in many things like vitamins and candy. i found this great web site a few months ago called vegetarianvitamins.com. they sell vitamins with no gelatin or other ingredients derived from animals.|`|1IrVn1Dlaa	Well, the majority of gelatin contains cartilage and proteins, which they extract from animals.|`|wjlLWqLuaa	no
YtRB9Mhtaa	My daughters LOVE Poptarts, but they are allergic to some of the ingredients.  For their birthdays, I buy Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, (Strawberry Frosted, 6-Count Boxes).  They are the health food version of Poptarts!  They have no dyes, corn syrup, etc., but they cook and look the same.  Personally, I think they taste better.  <br>  <br>  You can buy them at health food stores or buy them on Amazon.  If you eat Poptarts every morning- you could buy a 3 month supply for about $33 on Amazon.  I'll try to hook up a link...

u3u9RQG3aa	To make clean up easier, line your roasting pan with aluminum foil. <br>  Do not add water to the roaster. <br>  To avoid drying out ham, cook slowly at 325oF. Allow 20 to 30 minutes per pound for ham that has not been precooked (follow directions on label for precooked hams). <br>  Begin roasting ham by placing fat side up, the melting fat will baste your ham. Turn ham over half way through baking to avoid uneven salting from the brine in the meat. <br>  For a crisp surface on your ham roast, be sure the oven is preheated before placing the roast into the oven in an uncovered pan. <br>  Do not use sharp utensils that may pierce the ham when trying to turn it. The piercing allows valuable juices to escape. Use other utensils, such as wooden spoons and spatulas for turning the meat. <br>  Do not overcook pork or it will become dry and tough. The threat of trichinosis is eliminated when the pork is heated to 137°F but the USDA recommends cooking pork to 160°F to be safe. Cooking to 160°F will result in clear or slightly pink tinted juices from the juicy and tender meat. <br>  After ham has completed roasting, take ham out of oven and let stand 15 minutes before slicing. Ham will continue to bake when out of the oven and letting ham stand for 15 minutes makes it easier to carve. <br>  Do not partially cook pork and then store in refrigerator to use later. It must be cooked until done.|`|AA10703634	you should put it in a tray/bowl thingy then cover it in aluminum foil then put it in another tray filled with water to make it juicer and better tasting. plus add in what ever flavoring u prefer, pineapples or herbs or soy sauce  etc....  on ham<br>  <br>  p.s that' s a really small ham|`|AA11963397	if you have a crockpot, i would put it in there. on low for a couple of hours. it shouldn't dry out in there. add a bit of water, maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup...|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	1 lb?<br>  Amazingly small.<br>  Put it face down, toss a can of crushed pineapples on it and bake it for 20 minutes in 325F.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	A POUND?

As a result, there is often regurgitation of gastric acid from the stomach into the lower esophagus producing spasm and inflammation of the lining that may produce chest pain that is very similar to angina pectoris, including the fact that it may be precipitated by exertion, and relieved by sublingual nitroglycerine. In fact, esophageal disorders often coexist with coronary artery disease.<br>  <br>  Chest pain from esophageal disorders is usually precipitated by eating of food, or by lying down after eating, and it can be relieved by antacids and milk. <br>  <br>  Often it is accompanied by heartburn and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Unlike angina pectoris, which typically radiates across the upper and mid chest, esophageal pain tends to be located at the lower end of the sternum (breastbone) and radiates to the epigastrium. <br>  <br>  Certain kinds of food more characteristically produce esophageal pain. These include alcohol, spicy food, Mexican food, and coffee. Unlike angina, which tends to last less than 5-10 minutes, esophageal pain may last for hours and fluctuate in intensity. GERD can be effectively treated with proton pump inhibitors such as Prilosec.|`|EbhDuNWHaa	That is the sensation of the alcohol going down your throat.

They will puff up in the skillet, so only add a few at a time. As they begin to puff up, remove and drain them on paper towels. Be sure to cook long enough as the under cooked noodles will be like eating needles. Once cooked, add them to the salad mixture. <br>  In a large bowl combine the iceberg lettuce, cooked and shredded chicken, green onions and toasted sesame seeds. Let chill about 10 minutes, and just before serving add the cooked rice noodles. Serve in salad bowls and offer the dressing in a pourable container so your family can add as much dressing as they want. You can also pour the dressing over the top of the salad, toss, and serve immediately.

Boil the chicken, with soy sauce, vinegar and water. Don't put in too much soy sauce because that will make it too salty. Toss the garlic, onion, and bay leaves in with everything.<br>  <br>  Let everything boil for a while so the flavor concentrates and really gets into the meat. After about 20-30 minutes, depending on how much water you put in, you add more soy sauce or vinegar depending on how it looks and how concentrated the flavor is. If it tastes salty you add vinegar. If it doesn't look brown enough or lacks flavor you add some soy sauce. When its near completion you add black pepper.<br>  <br>  Enjoy with rice!|`|Oa2HN2idaa	MAIN:Brandy Peppered Steaks <br>  <br>  ingredients:<br>  <br>  60 ml/4 tbsp green peppercorns, crushed<br>  900 g/2 lb fillet steak, cut into four slices<br>  25 g/1 oz/2 tbsp butter or margarine<br>  15 ml/1 tbsp oil<br>  25 g/1 oz/0.25 cup plain (all-purpose) flour<br>  250 ml/8 fl oz/1 cup Beef Stock<br>  30 ml/2 tbsp brandy<br>  30 ml/2 tbsp single (light) cream<br>  Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>  <br>  Method:<br>  <br>   Press the peppercorns into both sides of the steaks.
