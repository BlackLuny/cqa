eUgwHzeqaa	The strong probability is that no matter what kind of hematological issue you have, you will not be allowed to donate any blood product.  You can certainly call up your local blood donation center and ask, though.  There is no particular reason that you would also have problems with your platelets, though I don't know what your anemia is caused by specifically.    The issues with using your blood are twofold.  First, they will not take blood from someone who is already anemic because it might hurt YOU.  If your ability to make red blood cells is already reduced for some reason, it's just not a good idea to donate some of them.    Secondly, if you have a morphology issue with your RBCs (I'm taking a guess that you mean a thalassemia or some such thing?), then your blood is not going to be especially useful for others.  It's not just a question of fortifying with iron--they can't use blood that isn't able to carry oxygen well, because it's going to be used for people who really need help with that.  Red blood cells with pathological morphology are not as good at carrying oxygen.    People who have some types of anemia, like simple iron-deficiency anemia, may be able to donate after fortifying their own diet (and the other up side to that is that they will no longer be anemic!).|`|0xFQj585aa	Honey, it's not that there's not enough iron in the blood your donating - it doesn't need to be fortified, the reason you can't donate is for your own safety. (unless it is to do with the disorder causing your anaemia)  If you don't have enough blood as it is, you can't afford to give any away!    In platelet (or plasma) donation, they pump the blood out of your body, separate the platelets/plasma out and pump the red cells back into your body. You will still need to have over the baseline haemoglobin level to donate though.    To get your iron levels up eat plenty of red meat and green leafy vegetables and if you are chronically anaemic, it may be a good idea to consider iron supplements.|`|OXw0rv4Saa	They can't just add iron to anemic blood because that's not really what an anemia is.  The anemia (which it can be caused by low iron) is actually a low red blood cell count.  You have fewer red blood cells per drop of blood than a non-anemic person.  If you take iron for your anemia, it's only to make sure your body has enough iron to produce as many red blood cells (RBC's) as it can.     Some types of anemia also cause the RBC's that are there to be misshapen.  Adding vitamins or minerals, etc, to that blood isn't going to make the donated blood better (or else it would have cured you!)  The problem is in your bones, not in your blood.  Supplementing your vitamins in your diet only helps your bones make more healthy cells.    I don't know if your anemia would affect your platelets, but likely you would still not be able to donate.  To donate platelets, they still have to remove significant amounts of blood from your body, filter out the platelets, and then put it back.  In this process, many delicate RBC's will be destroyed.  The removal and destruction of a significant number of your RBC's (especially if yours are weak and more prone to breaking) could cause you to faint, or go into cardiac arrest, or starve your brain for oxygen.    The Red Cross can't endanger you in order to possibly gain some platelets to save someone else.    I appreciate your heart and your desire to donate- please continue to encourage your friends and family to donate blood- but please don't endanger yourself!  There are others ways that you can help out those in need.
P4cvrMxgaa	they are exactly the same with respect to the active chemical (the drug).  Both Prozac and generic fluoxetine have other things in the capsules or tablets, they are not 100% active ingredient.  The differences between the brand and generic formulations can only be in those other ingredients.  Examples would be maybe brand name Prozac uses green dye while generic fluoxetine uses red dye.  Brand name Prozac might use lactose as a filler, and the generic company might use glucose as a filler.  Often times the company that makes the brand name drug makes the generic as well.  In this case the 2 are usually indentical with respect to all ingredients.|`|YbVFL3SOaa	The major difference is the cost.  When the patent on a medicine runs out, generics can be manufactured by companies other than the one which developed it.

Generally the generics are of good quality if the company has been approved by an oversight group such as the FDA.|`|OXw0rv4Saa	Brand name and generic medications are the same exact drug, just made by a different company.

There are pheromone products for women and I have heard that they work just as well as the ones for men (obviously I have no direct experience with this, my being a man).    A good source of information on these is the Pherotalk Forum:    http://www.pheromonetalk.com/    The only two good sources for pheromone products I know of are Love Scent and Androtics Direct.  Love Scent sells most of the commercial brands that are legitimate.  You have to be careful as many brands are not legitimate.  Love Scent does an excellent job of only carrying the good brands.  Androtics Direct manufactures its own stuff and is currently the best available.  Give their Instant Sexiness product a try.  You'll be very happy.

CF5y5uywaa	Everyone is WRONG    1.) the slop of y=12 is 0!    2.) the y intercept is 1 because    y= mx + b    m=slope  b=y-intercept|`|AA10927246	Several people are saying that the slope of y = 12 is undefined.  They are mistaken.    y = 12 is a horizontal line with a slope of zero.  They are thinking of a *vertical* line like x = 12.  In that case the slope would be undefined.    PROBLEM 1:  Horizontal lines of the form y = ?? have a slope of zero.  Vertical lines of the form x = ?? have an undefined slope.    Your line is horizontal with a slope of zero.    If you are unsure, just write the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):  y = 0x + 12    You can just read off the slope (m) which is 0.    Answer:  Slope(m) = 0    PROBLEM 2:  y = -2x + 1    Again you can just read off the y-intercept (b) which is +1.    Answer:  y-intercept(b) is 1|`|EW9Dgbz7aa	1.   undefined    2.   1|`|rESVCrl8aa	1. 0  2. 1|`|3Dhacs6caa	1. 0  2. y=1    i was on the lesson monday!|`|cwXsXhnyaa	1 is not undefined!!!! i PROMISE!!!!! its 0|`|xOQdlBhcaa	If you have an equation y = a constant, the slope is always 0.    Extra information:  If you have an equation x = a constant, the slope is always undefined.    The y-intercept is when x = 0, so substitute 0 in for x.    y = -2x + 1  y = -2(0) + 1  y = 0 + 1  y = 1    So the y-intercept is (0,1).    Usually to find the y-intercept, it is all the constant in the functions added together because multiply any number by 0 is gone. In this case, it is 1.|`|lNyqUmcFaa	Don't you just hate math??

For any interval of x values:  Rise = 0 (the graph does not ever rise, it stays at constant height)  Run = that interval of x values.    For example, from  x= 0 to x= 1, the graph does not rise or fall at all (rise  = 0) while the graph went to the right 1 (run = 1)    so, rise over run gives: 0/1 which = 0, not undefined.  If the graph was x = 12 (or something) then opposite would be true. The run would be zero, but would have some sort of rise.  This would yield: 1/0 (or some fraction with zero in denominator) which is undefined (cannot divide by zero).    2))  The y intercept is 1.  Remember the equation:  y = mx + b  m = slope, b = y intercept    In this case -2 is the slope and 1 is the y intercept

9iutgEYAaa	Developmental biology will cover a 'baby' animal's life from conception till it reaches sexual maturity (sometimes further if the animal undergoes changes after maturation).     Primarily, developmental biologists are concerned with the genetic and molecular mechanics of how the animal develops structurally from a singe cell.     Focus can range from things like how the major bodily systems change, (like the circulatory and respiratory systems going from a liquid breathing fetus to an air breathing newborn in the case of mammals for example), or how the DNA tells what parts to develop, when, in what shape, out of what material etc., how chemicals direct the process of cell growth and differentiation, or how changes in any step of the process (i.e. by environmental contaminants or experience)  affect the organism at any later stage in life.     Keywords you might want to think about in your preliminary search are:  developmental biology, ontogeny, zygote, neoteny, embryology, prenatal, perinatal, postnatal    Also, many universities have specific areas of interest in the field of developmental biology such as genetics, biochemistry, environmental contamination and toxicology, phylogeny, or neurobiology    to get a feel for what the field mainly encompasses here is a link to an intermediate vertebrate developmental anatomy class at North Carolina State University's (fantastic) Zoology department:  http://courses.ncsu.edu/zo370/common/

YV9Txf75aa	The answer I got is 120 nm, or 1.2*10^2 nm in scientific notation.    You should be given the velocity (and you have to convert it into meters/second) in this problem. But anyway I'll do this the best I can up until the point I need a velocity, with your given information. This is more like  physics than chemistry, IMO.    So, you have to know this 1 eV = 1.602218*10^-19 J    This is called the fundamental charge    and you also have to know the total Energy (Et) . Et = E_work + E_kinetic of electron. (I'm going to abbreviate them, respectively as WE and KE)    WE = (4.37)*(1.602218*10^-19) = 7.00*10^-19 J      The mass of an electron is 9.10938*10^-31 kg, so use that as your mass in the next equation    KE = [m(v)^2]/2 ==> KE =  [(9.10938*10^-31 kg)*(v (in m/s)^2]/2 = ? J    1 J = 1 kg*(m/s)^2    Since this is hard to explain with the v missing, I'm going to make v = 1.5*10^3 km/s ==> 1.5*10^6 m/s    Now ...    KE = [(9.10938*10^-31 kg)*(1.5*10^6 m/s)^2]/2 = 1.02480525*10^-18 J    So now...     Et = WE + KE =    1.02480525*10^-18 J +7.00*10^-19 J = 1.72480525*10^-18 J    Now that you have the total E needed to eject the electron, you can use the equations c = Lv (L = wavelength in meters; v = frequency in hertz or s^-1) and E = hv (h = Planck's constant = 6.626*10-34 Js)    c = speed of light = 2.998*10^8 m/s    so by using v = c/L, you can get L = (c*h)/E    L = (2.998*10^8 m/s)*(6.626*10-34 Js)/(1.72480525*10^-18 J) =  meters 1.2*10^-7 m    and then convert m into nm    1.2*10^-7 m *(1*10^9 nm/1 m) = 1.2*10^2 nm     Note: Calculator will say 115.1709... but since we need 2 significant figures for the answer, 115's closest 2 sig fig up is 120 ==> so the answer is 120 nm.|`|MHBc2fvJaa	oh my gosh, i have the same question too! only that the electrons are ejected with a velocity of 3.7 x 10^3 km x s. so i cant figure it out for now but i will eventually, i hope.

rdENr9BWaa	Rapid diversification can occur if a species is subject to a strong selective pressure.  Natural selection is the main force that drives evolution, so if the climate changes, or if predators or a food source changes, a population can quickly change to adapt to the new environment.  Slight variations exist within populations, and the individuals that are best adapted will be more likely to pass on their genes, and the trait will become more prevalent.  On the other hand, a stable environment, or organisms that can succeed in varying environments can remain unchanged for long periods of time.  An example of this are crocodiles, which haven't changed in millions of years.

Good luck.|`|TPpTAKAdaa	I used to totally stink at math, it was my least favorite subject.  But then, a few years ago, I started loving it and finding it generally easier and easier.  What I did, was keep an elaborate math composition book.  There, I wrote down all the notes the teacher gave us, very organized with the date on it.  I also did my book work in the composition book, and I actually wrote down the question, so when my teacher put the answers on the overhead, I could actually try and understand any mistakes I had made.    Another tip is, the very day you do not understand something, even the littlest thing, I would go into lunch help with my teacher.  Math cirriculums brush by so quickly, and if you do not understand the first bit, you cannot come close to understanding anything else.  Do not be afriad to ask questions.    Also, it may sound really basic, but always do your homework, every single night.  It serves as amazing practice, and you never have to worry about running out of time to finish it, as oppose to class work.  Also, when doing your homework, try as hard as possible, and go back to any notes if you do not understand a question.  My mathbook has the answers to the odd numbered problems in the back, I always check with that after I attempt a problem I do not fully understand.

f7Rk1sbmaa	I got 30.65 m as one answer.    Remember if something is being thrown at an angle from the ground then it is a good idea to break your velocity into its x and y components.    Here are your knowns:    theta=53  y=10 m  a (in y direction)= -9.8  V (in y direction)= V*sin53= 25*sin53  a (x direction)= 0 !  V (in x direction)= V*cos53= 25*cos53  VFy= 0 (Final velocity at top of its path is 0. Lets assume that when the water reaches the top of the path, it is 10 m off the ground)  VFx=0    First find the time it takes to reach 10 m.    Vf= Vo + at  Arrange for t:  25sin53/ 9.8= 2.04 seconds for water to reach height of 10m.    Now we can use this time to find how far it will travel in that time:    x= Vxt + 1/2at^2    Since a (in x)= 0, 1/2at^2 cancels out and you are left with:  x= 25cos53(2.04)= 30.65 m!    And so, you put out the fire.  I hope I did it right, bye!

It's kind of hard to explain, but here's an example that will hopefully clear it up.  If you were measuring how quickly water cools down, time would be the independent variable, because it's not affected by anything else, it's independent.  The temperature of water would be the dependent variable because it can be predicted based on how long it's been.|`|twRHpxtqaa	just remember that which is independent is the variable you establish, while the dependent variable is relative to it.

Entropy is the tendency of everything to become more disorganized.  In a closed system, such as our entire universe, things naturally fall apart as time goes on.  This applies whether the ultimate end of the universe occurs in the Big Rip, Heat Death, or the Big Crunch.    The Big Rip is a proposed ending to our universe as it has been determined lately that the universe's expansion is accelerating.  This goes against common sense and so the ad hoc hypothesis has been put forth that dark energy exists and that by some means it is more powerfully pushing the universe apart, overcoming the pull of gravity.  If this acceleration continues, it is proposed that the very fabric of space-time will be torn apart.  I do not agree with this viewpoint.    I tend to believe as loop quantum gravity theory proposes: the universe is truly eternal.  It will expand to the point of Heat Death and remain there for an indeterminate amount of time (especially indeterminate for time within the Universe will have stopped) until something outside of the Universe disturbs the incredible delicate balance herein.    Gravity will do its eternal job and attract matter to matter, there will be the Universal Contraction (instead of the Universal Expansion which we are experiencing now).  All things in the Universe will form as the Universe contracts until it reaches the Big Crunch, followed immediately by the Big Bang, causing Universal Expansion (as we experience now) and so forth with no real end in sight.

ltDnlSqJaa	The name Rowan is the common name generally applied to the Mountain Ash tree. There is a great deal of history regarding the Rowan in regards to mythology (see the link below).   While the Mountain Ash or Rowan tree does belong to the plant family Rosaceae, it does not belong to the genus Rosa. It is of the genus Sorbus. The most common cultivars of Sorbus in landscaping are Sorbus aucuparia (European Mountain Ash) and Sorbus americana (American Mountain Ash). There are about 100 different species of Sorbus found between Europe and North America.  The Guelder Rose or Viburnum opulus (European cranberry) also belongs to the plant family Rosaceae but the Genus is Viburnum.  The berries from the Rowan tree can be used for jams and jellies, as a substitute for coffee, as an ingredient in alcoholic beverages, as flavoring for liquers and ales, and to produce wine. While there are food applications, these berries should not be eaten raw because of certain toxicities. The must be cooked or otherwise processed.|`|gCn6bXAFaa	No, rowan is in the genus Sorbus, family Rosaceae.  Though rosaceae is the rose family, guelder rose isn't actually a rose.

g5M5Ivhgaa	You're right about part A    Velocity in the x-direction does not affect the effect of acceleration in the y-direction due to gravity, so both will hit the bottom at the same time.    For part B, again your correct, since there isnt a vertical wall to stop them, both cars will keep going until they hit the ground.  Since they hit the ground at the same time, the one going faster will always go farther due to d=vt    For part C, do a free fall equation d=Vot+.5at^2  12m=0m/s(t)+.5(9.8m/s^2)(t^2)  t=1.56s    d is distance travelled  Vo is initial velocity in the y-direction  a is acceleration due to gravity  t is time|`|1Z6ELlIgaa	A) car a, because it's mass is alreaady in movement, so it will fall faster.  B) car a, again, because it's mass is already in movement at high speed, so it will go furthher away  C) i'm sorry, but i have no idea|`|5OYlafG2aa	You're correct with your assumption on part a.    Part b you can use your answer to part a as proof, since they both are falling for the same time, which is going to go further?  The one with a lower velocity or higher?   Since all we care about is the x component and there's no accelerations in that direction they'll have the same speed in that direction until they hit.  So a guy running 4m/s  vs a guy running 2 m/s for the same time, which will go further?      c.  Find in your book "equations of motion", should have one that says something like x = x0 + v0t + 1/2 at^2 or something.. well the accelerations are in the y direction and there's no initial y velocity so y_final = y_initial + 1/2 (10 m/s) * t^2  (10 since you're asked for order of magnitude)

4fWZL4TRaa	Power is proportional to torque x RPM. This race is a bit like a drag race. It is about squeezing the most from the motor and the car. It is less about the sustained high speed.    The motor torque is limited by the current the wires can carry and magnetic saturation of the armature, as well as diameter and reaction of the rotor. Motor speed is also limited, particularly when connected to a gearbox, as motors and gearboxes have a speed rating. There should be no limitations from the battery (it can supply any current that is demanded). I suggest a lithium polymer rechargeable battery (cell), which will give about 4V when well charged, just right for the motor. These are much lighter than others for the power and energy produced. Use wires that do not limit the current flow by having voltage drop at start-up. Make them short so they do not add to the weight more than necessary. Eliminate all unnecessary weight and friction. I think this is where most gains can be made.    Here are some points to ponder:  You need the motor torque and power curves to help understand the best utilisation. You could work these out yourself (see link below) but maybe they came with the motor. You need to know the ratings at 4V for:  Stall torque  No load RPM  Maximum power at what RPM.    The link below explains motor power/speed, and torque/speed curves. At a constant voltage, the torque is proportional to speed. The power has a peak, because it is the product of torque and speed.    A gearbox is to match the motor power/speed/torque to a constant load. This is easy, because the conditions are more or less static or stable. The situation here is different, under acceleration is not clear at all, because the conditions are changing all the time.    One of the problems here is that everything happens so quickly that it is difficult to understand by observation alone. You need instrumentation, and that is expensive (and maybe adds weight).    There is no simple formula, because you are looking at many interdependent things. The winner is just due to small changes, more about attention to detail than anything a calculation will show. I mean that using WD40 or better on the gears if gears are used, may be more important than the actual ratio. Also the battery. Voltage from a fully charged battery varies 50% down to discharged. An optimised battery could be much lighter than say 3 x AA Ni-MH cells. On some types the voltage drops quickly initially, but you might get a couple of runs at enhanced voltage (over 4V). This could have as big an effect as a gearbox.    There are no precise figures to do calculations with (vague variables). Once you get to a certain level, I think it is trial and error. I would try it with no gears, as a benchmark. If you could record the speed along the way, it helps understand what changes will help. Maybe a video camera can help there.    Modelling..  You could try to plot the curve of the car's speed versus the motor, just using a simple model of the car's mass, with the motor characteristics applied through the wheels. The method is to recalculate the car speed for each time increment of say 10 ms, then update the motor speed (hence torque, power etc). Easier with a computer program (excel?). The formulae are basic physics, F=MA stuff and on to Velocity, with motor characteristics like in the link. Torque becomes a force at the wheels, using the diameter. Once you have it working, try some "what if" like changing mass, adding gears, adding a loss for gears, friction in the car itself.|`|JOtJG9Zlaa	Trial and error.

R9KvEhMxaa	Not strictly.     Benzodiazepines are essentially exclusive partial allosteric agonists of GABA-A. GABA-A is a ligand gated ion channel made of five subunits, not a GPCR. There's more than twenty different subunits, though most are made of an alpha joined to a gamma and beta. Tolerance is mediated by a specific version of alpha (alpha-1 I believe, could be alpha-2, there's too many to easily remember)    Basically, wether or not tolerance develops to an effect depends on which GABA-A makeup produces the effect, which depends on where in the brain it is located. The anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines are mediated by the same subtype, and hence, do not develop tolerance - these receptors lack the necessary machinery to do so.    The sedative effect is mediated by a seperate isoform of GABA-A. Z-drugs are selective for this one. It possesses the alpha subunit necessary for tolerance to develop. It's been demonstrated in transgenic mice that you can take this alpha unit, and place it in the GABA receptors necessary for anxiolysis and tolerance will develop.    The amnesic and muscle-relaxant effects are harder to pin down and localize. I can't comment on them. The amnesic effect is dose dependent however.    Benzodiazepines do not make especially good antiemetics. I don't think I've ever actually seen one used -specifically- for this in the absence of another indication (anxiety etc). Usually 1st gen H1 antagonists like Pheniramine are preferred.    There are three types of GABA receptors. GABA-A, which is a 5 subunit ligand gated ion channel, GABA-B which IS a GPCR and is not touched by benzodiazepines. These are more or less exclusively located in the autonomic nervous system. Baclofen is an agonist of these. GABA-C is the final type, also ligand gated ion channels made exclusively of 'rho' subunits. These are not to be touched, horrible things happen when they are. They are exclusively associated with certain aspects of vision.    This is roughly what a GABA-A looks like:  http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~ddavies/GABAA.gi...    EDIT: It's an 'okay' antiemetic. The main reason you'd use a higher potency benzo or high dose with chemotherapy is that chemo is quite possibly one of the most horrible experiences imaginable, especially platinum based chemo. You'd usually mix dexamethasone and Ondansetron in to deal with the really bad stuff, but for some of the milder chemos, I suppose Lorazepam alone would work. It's matter of perspective. Wouldn't use benzos with opiate nausea.    As for the thumbs down, I think I pissed Minerva (one of local batshi!t nuts altmed witchdoctors, almost as unbalanced and off-her-meds as that guy with the NF brain tumors and the fixation on breast milk) http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Most of my answers mysteriously got thumbs down about an hour after writing that.    As for GABA-C. Well. The only commercialized drug I know of that has any effect on it is a nasty little bastard called Vigabatrin, in use in Canada. It's an anti-seizure drug, one of those off the deep end potent ones that gets kept locked up in the back of the medicine cabinet until everything else fails. It's a GABA analogue that acts as a suicide substrate for GABA-T (think of it like this, it's an MAOI for GABA). It severely limits the body's ability to breakdown GABA, and has the effect of giving every GABA receptor in the body a major kick.     Well, in the retinal nerves, that causes them to irreversibly decay. Doesn't cause problems for any other nerves using other GABA receptors though. The amount of damage is proportional to the dose and length of use. However, it works for drug resistant Lennox-Gastaut (which already responds to basically no seizure medications) and West Syndrome.    So yeah, basically blindness.    In the US, we use Acthar. $32,000 dollars a dose, and it destroys the heart.    EDIT: Well, admittedly one dose lasts for some time. But given how unspeakably horrible West syndrome is, a little heart damage is preferable.     Ativan's an okay choice. You'd need to be at the higher end of the dosage. The main thing when you're selecting benzos for things like chemo is half life, and kick. You don't want whoever has to get through the treatment to be very aware of it, much less remember it, be subject to panic, anxiety and the like. Midazolam(versed), or Triazolam (Halcion - but I don't think they make this IV anymore). It's just, in my experience, I wouldn't think Ativan alone would be enough to manage the nausea, though it certainly could put someone out of it enough to tolerate bad kinds of chemo.    It's not clear if they're subject to tolerance or not. No one's quite sure how the effect comes about (that I'm aware of).    I got about fifty horrific emails from Razwell - who if you haven't seen, shows up about once a month here. I'm not sure if it's because his ban expires, or he runs out of Vitamin H, and starts posting with about eight accounts about cholesterol conspiracies in all capitals. I made the mistake of answering one of his posts about JPandS.|`|JOChNigNaa	Wow!  I knew it had to do with receptors, but AzR increased my knowledge exponentially.
7ENILyMhaa	First solve the denominator.   So do 4^2 which is 16.   Then do (x^-2)^2 which is x^4.   (y^-1)^2 is y^-2  Thus the denominator is 16x^4y^-2  Now on to the numerator  2^2 is 4  (x^2)^2 is x^4  (y^3)^2 is y^6  Thus the numerator is 4x^4y^6    The answer is 4x^4y^6/16x^4y^-2
JDl0z6TGaa	Equilibrium favors left because the charges are more neutral    When OH is added to the system, the equilibrium will favor more to the left. Therefore it becomes more basic.    When OH- is decreased in the system, the system has to make more OH- to replenished the OH molecules that were taken out. Therefore the equilibrium favors right, making the it more acidic.    How to tell if basic or acidic?  NH3 wants to take an H from H20 making it a basic reaction.    NH4 wants to give OH- an H making it an acidic reaction.    Hope this helps

YrOTZsjtaa	Viewed edge-on the string forms the hypotenuse of a triangle with the adjacent side located where the string hanging at rest would be. The opposite side has length equal to the radius of the base of the cone. The angle subtended by the string while swinging with the position where hanging is :    sin = opposite / hypotenuse   = tan?1(0.30m / 1.0m)   = 17.5    From Newton's 2nd law, the forces acting vertically are :    F = 0 = Tcos - mg    Solving for T :    T = mg / cos  = (0.600kg)(9.80m/s2) / cos17.5  = 6.17N
4A6kUcB3aa	The mother can contribute either an A or an O, because for her to be heterozygous she has a mixture, not "pure" AA (if she were AA she would be homozygous.)  However, the father is homozygous B, so he can contribute either one of his B's or the other one of his Bs (he has two, or BB).  For the child to be AB, it has to get the A from the mother (chance is 50%, or 0.5, or 1/2) and a B from the father (chance is 100%, or 1.0).  You multiply   0.5 x 1.0=0.5, which is the same as 50%.      The universal donor is "O-" because if your blood type is O-, you can give your blood to anyone of any blood type and they won't have a bad reaction (the negative sign means no Rh antigen)    The universal receiver is AB+, because no matter what blood type you are given, you would not have a bad reaction.  (the + means you have the Rh antigen already)
AA12336056	The formulas you are given in class for the period of an oscillating system (like a spring or a pendulum) are derived and simplified.    You start off with forces. You have tension and weight. Newton's Second Law F = ma gives -mg sin ? = m (d2s/dt2) where ? is the angle the string makes to the perpendicular. You do a hell of a lot of calculus, and you get T = 2(L/g). This is assuming that ? is a small angle. All of the math done to derive this equation depends upon ? being less then 45 degrees because for small ?, the sin ?  ?.    If you pulled the string or spring back further than 45 degrees, mass will factor into the equation. I would redo the trials not pulling the mass back as far and you should get better results.
OlfVNTuYaa	Basically, yes.    Anything you can see is due to the light that has reflected off of it.    The light travels into your eye and hits your retina, which converts it into a signal to your brain. You have different kinds of receivers in your eyes that respond to different wavelengths.     Like you said: it isn't that much different from what a digital camera does.|`|f35JARiiaa	Take a look at this video http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=AW_jXrIQXE...    And start watching at the sixth minute. Our eyes recieve light energy (photons) and then they transform it into electric impulse that our brain see. but you can basically talk about it as frequency... wavelength an also electromagnetic radiaton (since the rainbow is in it). If you wonder why frequency or wavelength you just need one of these to know the energy. You'll know it when you take a look at this fomula E = (hc)/wavelength.  where E= energy, h= Planck's constant, c=speed of light, lamda as wavelenght
xWEYZWjZaa	I am not sure what frequency you are getting. If you meant 42ns signal and 83ns pause it derives to exactly 8MHZ, but then it should be the crystal frequency. You won't get square wave from single inverter because it is made to work as linear inverting amplifier. You have to connect another gate to the output to act as buffer and feed the rest of the circuit with square wave.

The 74HCU04 is a bit slow for this frequency, I'd use something faster like a 74AS04    some circuits  http://www.z80.info/uexosc.htm      edit. 17MHz is a period of 60nS, which means you need switching times of well less than 30nS. the 74AHCU04 will do this as long as Vcc is 5 volts or higher.    .|`|yxnUBSJqaa	I don't think you can stabilize it.

yrEuZXSOaa	They did not. We still do not. Microscopes are not powerful enough to see individual molecules, let alone atoms. We are able to tell the componenets of atoms.

uOqk7PzGaa	Probably, the relative distances between the bike and the rider can change, but the overall center of mass will preserve the original trayectory and the total momentum will not change.     So, if he does it just right, he can advance his body forward at the expense of making the bike recede or slow down in motion.
yxnUBSJqaa	When the resistors are in parallel they are called branches.  The source voltage is dropped across each resistor in the branch.  Here you only have one in each branch so you know that the full 15V is being used by each resistor.    In a series circuit the current stays the same through each resistor and the voltage suppied by the source equals all the voltage drops added together.    In a parallel circuit the voltage remains the same in each branch and the current varies through each branch.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Resistors connected in parallel all share a common voltage.  That would be 15 volts, in this case.  So the current through each resistor depends only on that common voltage and the value of the resistor.  Ohm's law relates resistance, voltage and current, since ohms just means ratio of voltage divided by current.  By the way if you calculate the current through each of the resistors and add them all up you find the total current through the 15 volt supply.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|FtaSznSQaa	No... you add the resistors in a series circuit.  In a parallel circuit, calculate the current through each resistor, and then add the currents.    It = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3    It = 15/12k + 15/27k + 15/47k = 2.125mA    Thanks for replying with "V"...    You could also calculate the equivalent resistance.    1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 = 1/12k + 1/27k + 1/47k    1/Rt = 141.65*10^-6    Rt = 7.06kohm    Now calculate It = V/Rt    It = 15/7.06kohm = 2.125mA    Oooops... the problem asks for the current in R3, so that is simply:    I3 = V/R3 = V/47kohms = 15/47kohms = 319A|`|bG4f83E4aa	So you must have left out the voltage source, but what you have to do is find the total current, just like you said (make sure that you add resistors in parallel, not in series).    Once you have the total current, you have to use do a current divider between R3 and the equivalent resistance of R1 and R2.

g5M5Ivhgaa	I'm not sure if this answers your question but i'll take a stab at it    a noble gas' electron configuration is always so that it's valence shell is full.  therefore, it will not bind to anything else nor give up or take electrons.  so no ions would be formed    Of course in chemistry, there are always a few odd ones out like Xe but i think that has something to do with d orbitals and f orbitals.     Sorry, didn't go through enough school to explain why there are odd ones.
AA11134471	my guess is you stripped a gear in the gear box. The clicking noise is an obvious sign, which as the gear strips down more, makes less sound, until it no longer has any teeth left on it.    replace the gear box and turn the shaft very slowly. As you say, with 6V connected to the motor, the output shaft rotated 1 time every 2 seconds, so turn it at that rate or less, but start out much slower until it gets moving. if it starts clicking again go even slower!|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	The gearbox provides a large step down ratio so that when you turn the output shaft by hand, you are not turning the motor very fast.  That is why the DC motor is not generating very much voltage.  You would have to spin the output shaft about 574 times a fast to get the voltage you expect.  That is how it works.|`|JOtJG9Zlaa	One of the gears is slipping on the shaft,and not turning the motor. The ratio is too great and cannot turn motor 574 times to 1 output shaft revolution,when used as a generator.|`|jjKCjWzZaa	What type of motor? Series, shunt, compound?    The motor must be designed to work both as generator and motor.    The following applies to a shunt or compound generator.    In old type big synchronous power stations:    Due to own residual magnetism, the Pilot excitor generate DC supply which supplies its own magnitising current and the same to the main excitor, which in turn supplies magnetising current of the main generator.    If the residual magnetism of the pilot excitor is lost, it can be re magnitised by an external DC voltage.    In your case by a switching arrangement first give magnetising supply from a battery, own magnetising wiring disconnected. When correct output voltage is obtained, check positive of battery corosponds to positive of generated voltage, to avoid short circuit. Then suddenly remove battery supply and switch on own magnetising supply. Then only an external load can be connected.|`|8f1645b57626d40f1d90691f3e9c2772aa	I don't think you're going to be able to turn that motor by forcing the output shaft.  That gear ratio is just too high.    With the gear box off you're going to have to get it spinning very fast to get 6V.  Basically as fast as it turn when you put 6 volts on its terminals.  I think the point of the science far is to simply show that ANY electricity can be generated at all when the shaft is turned.  Don't expect to get a full 6V.

Do keep in mind that either one will require getting a PhD in the field, and if you want to be an astronomer you should be majoring in physics, and if you want to be in neurology you'll probably have to major in bio to get into grad school.  Few schools have neuroscience majors to begin with, and those don't always have the preparation you need for a grad program, just like astrophysics usually doesn't contain enough physics to succeed in grad school.  So make sure you check out the grad requirements before choosing your undergrad major.

76LpTu3Gaa	This isn't a hard problem, it just takes a lot of steps. First, you have to calculate the time and height reached during the rocket during the acceleration period. To do this use the standard linear motion equations.  Vf^2=Vi^2+2ad --> Vf^2=51.2^2+2(1.91)(140) -->Vf=56.18m/s (after engine stops)  Then use mxht=Viy^2/19.6 --> mxht=56.18^2/19.6 --> mxht=161m; but then add the initial distance when the rocket was accelerating; 161m+140m=301m. Thus the rockets maximum height is 301m.    Then to figure out time to max height use:  d=Vit+(1/2)at^2 (to find time of acceleration) --> 140=51.2(t)+(1/2)(1.91)(t^2) --> 0=.955t^2+51.2t-140 (use quadratic equation) --> time=2.61 seconds for the acceleration period. Then to find the time after the acceleration to the top use:  Vf=Vi+at  0=56.18+(-9.81)t  t=5.73 sec   Then add the time for the acceleration period to the time for the rocket to stop. Thus: 2.61sec+5.73sec=8.34sec  The rocket takes a total of 8.34 sec to reach the top.    Then to find the time the rocket is in the air use:  d=(1/2)at^2 (d=distance to fall)  -301m=(1/2)(-9.8)t^2  t^2=61.43sec  tground=7.84sec  Then add this to the time to get to the top to find the total time in the air. Thus: 8.34sec+7.84sec=16.18sec    So in a nutshell:  Max height = 301m  Time for max height = 8.34sec  Total time in the air = 16.18sec    Hope this helps.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	If you are Obama, I'm sure you can use you can figure it out on your own.

K6QlFoo0aa	Integration by parts:     u dv = uv -  v du    Let u = 1 / (3x - 2)  du = [ln(3x-2) / 3] dx  dv = x dx  v = 1    uv = [1 / (3x - 2)]     v du =  [ln(3x-2) / 3] dx = (1/3) *  ln(3x -2) dx     [((3*x)-2)*ln((3*x)-2) + ((3*x-2)]/9)     For this integral you keep the ln(3x-2), you need to multiply the subject of the ln (that is (3x-2)) by that ln(3x-2), then you have to subtract that subject and finally divide by 3 which becomes 9 since there was already a 3 in the denominator.      This is a fairly standard example of the integration of a natural logarithm of a function.  It should be in your calculus book. :)    So the answer is:     [((3*x)-2)*ln((3*x)-2) + ((3*x-2)]/9)  ---------------------------
LwlfQvaNaa	Convert the grams of KOH into moles (molar mass of 56.106 g/mol).    Because you have an excess of acid, the KOH is the limiting reactant, so you will use up all of it.    Use stoichiometry to change the moles of KOH to H2O (it's a 1 to 1 ratio)    Then convert the moles of water into grams|`|f1734c79346c98e938e588703c7ac31faa	divide 19.6g by the molar mass of KOH(56.108) and then you'll have your KOH in moles .3934 mol KOH and then just set up your equation like this: .3934 mol KOH *2 and then divided by two. Which equals .3934 anyway. Believe me this is the right answer. If you are doing T-chart equations then if you put it in a T-chart it will all make sense. Then all you have to do is convert that number into grams to get your mass of water.

rttm1SLaaa	No.  Admittedly, a large enough amount (I don't know just how large) can kill you because of the hypo/hypertonic relationship between the fluid in the bloodstream and blood vessels.  There is a certain point at which that relationship becomes too separated, and the blood vessels either explode due to water intake (add more pure water and you'd see that) or shrivel up due to water exiting (make the fluid outside the cells less dilute).  One drop of water in the system wouldn't make a difference because the system is too huge.  You might see some exploding cells in the area of the drop, but it would be absorbed into the rest of the bloodstream after a time and be hardly any issue at all.  There's a lot of blood in our bodies.|`|KZJHW3UNaa	I'm not sure about the water but i know that air has the potential.

So:    L+W+L+W=150km ==>  2L+2W=150km  (Eqn. 1)    where L=length and W=width    The statement that the length is three more than five times the width can be written as:    L=5W+3  (Eqn. 2)    Plug equation (2) into (1), solve for W.    Then plug the result for W into equation (2) and solve for L.

7qxcQDsbaa	To answer these questions, it helps to know what each term means. The formulas for each would help too.    A). The mean age is just the average age. The units of the mean are just the same as the units of what you're averaging. What's the average price of a car? Whatever that answer is, it's in dollars. So in this case, the mean age is in the same units that the observed ages were recorded in: years.    B). Standard deviation... so tricky to understand if you look into it enough.    A Standard Deviation, like any measurement is can be thought of as a measure of "uniqueness" from the average. If we're talking about tests, and you got a score close to average, it's a common score. If you fail it completely it's pretty unique and probably far from average. If you ace it, that's also unique and far from average. So when you hear that this test was 4 Standard Deviations from average, that means it falls out the range of what a ton of people got. Lower number means less unique.     When you actually calculate a value for Standard Deviation is, the units are the same as what you're measuring. So here it's seconds.     C) Variance is squaring the standard deviation. That means the units are the square of what the standard deviation was in. In this case, seconds squared.    D) Median can be taken to mean "middle". So the "middle" age of the subjects was in units of? (what else do you measure age in?).    If you look up the formulas for each and stick in units, and then know how to do algebra for the units, you can understand the answers better (for units anyway).     Example: Find the average of these numbers:    5a, 5a, 5a, 5a     You would add them all 5a + 5a + 5a +5a = 20a and then divide how many there were. 20a / 4 = 5a    Units are like a variable. If you were to replace the variable "a" with "feet" and measure the average height of let's say those 4 people, you'd stick in feet where there was "a" and get the average to be 5 feet. Units follow the same algebraic rules as variables. So if you were to look up standard deviation and variance formulas, stick in units with the measurements, and then do the right algebra with the units (squaring, square rooting), you'll clearly see what the final units for those statistical quantities are.
aZUQvimWaa	(P1)(V1)=(P2)(V2)    It becomes an algebraic equation, and just solve for x (whichever term your missing). So you would divide to get the answer, you would not subtract. You would divide (4.62)(2.33), the answer you get there. You then divide it by 1.03.
31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    For a rectangular prism with the volume of 750 cubic centimeters, the length, width, and height can be any 3 numbers that would multiply together and equal 750. So it could be:    1 x 1 x 750 = 750  2 x 2 x 187.5 = 750  3 x 3 x 83? = 750  4 x 4 x 46.875 = 750  5 x 5 x 30 = 750  15 x 15 x 3? = 750  5 x 10 x 15 = 750  3 x 10 x 25 = 750  4 x 6.25 x 30 = 750  13 x 17 x 3.3936651583710407239819004524887 = 750  30 x 30 x 5/6 = 750    So there are an infinite number of solutions for length, width and height that would all have a volume of 750 cubic centimeters.    I hope that helps!! :-)

We have    n = 1200  p = 0.84  q = 1 - p = 0.16    The mean is np = 1008  The standard deviation is (npq) = 161.28 = 12.6996, so call it 12.7    The mean minus one standard deviation is 1008 - 12.7 = 995.3  The mean plus one standard deviation is 1008 + 12.7 =  1020.7    The binomial wants whole numbers, so we'll use 995 and 1020 for the limits.    Here are the results using BINOMDIST:    The binomial sum from 0 to 995 is 0.162392902  The binomial sum from 0 to 1020 is 0.837469814    Hence, the probability you're after is the difference of these numbers, so    Prob = 0.837469814 - 0.162392902 = 0.675076912

NbdTgyLPaa	The simplest way to think of this is to realize that a negative exponent means to invert your expression, this is by definition.  For example, if you have (4/5)^(-1), then the result is 5/4.  So you can just do your exponentiation as normal (that is as if it had a positive number instead of a negative one), and then take the reciprocal.  So 4^(-2) = (4^2)^(-1) = 16^(-1) = 1/16.  And 3^(-4) = (3^4)^(-1) = 81^(-1) = 1/81.
NbdTgyLPaa	This problem was fun.  The trick here is to realize that the ratio of the distances traveled by the two boats will always remain the same.  If you know some basic physics, you can see that pretty easily.  When the velocities are constant the ratio of velocities must also be constant.  And velocity is distance divided by time but the times are equal, the ratio of the ratio of the distances traveled must also be constant.  So the ratio of the distances traveled at the first intersection can be written as<br>  720/(d-720)<br>  where d is the total distance, i.e. the width of the river.  Similarly, the second time they meet, the ratio of the total distance traveled by each boat can be written as<br>  (d+400)/(2d-400)<br>  Since these are equal to each other, we just solve as follows<br>  720/(d-720) = (d+400)/(2d-400)<br>  720(2d-400) = (d+400)(d-720)<br>  1440d - 288000 = d^2 -320d - 288000<br>  d^2 - 1760d = 0<br>  d(d - 1760) = 0<br>  The d = 0 solution won't work in our problem, so d = 1760 meters<br>  Or the river is 1760 meters wide

AA10927246	I'm assuming it doesn't matter where in the flipping sequence you get 3 heads and 1 tail.    Any of the following sequences would be okay:  HHHT  HHTH  HTHH  THHH    The probability of any one of these sequences happening is 1/16.  That's because each coin flip has a 1/2 probability of coming up the way you expect.  1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16    But as I noted, there are 4 ways to have 3 heads and 1 tail.  If you are familiar with combinations, that is "4 choose 3" or "4 choose 1".  C(4,3) = C(4,1)    This is the 4th row of Pascal's triangle:  1 4 6 4 1    The terms are:  C(4,0) C(4,1) C(4,2) C(4,3) C(4,4)    As you can see C(4,1) = C(4,3) = 4    So multiply 1/16 by 4 = 4/16    Reduce:    Answer:  P(3 heads, 1 tail) = 1/4|`|mL3WTsXfaa	Since we have four tosses, let's use the fourth row of Pascal's triangle:    1 4 6 4 1    The first number (1) is the number of ways we can get 4 heads and 0 tails.  So the probability is 1/16.  The second number (4) is the number of ways we can get 3 heads and 1 tail.  So the probability is 4/16 = 1/4 (your answer).  The third number (6) is the number of ways we can get 2 heads and 2 tails, etc.    Another way to look at it -- we can get a tail on either the first, second, third, or fourth toss, so four of the sixteen combinations involve one tail.

RTY5VahLaa	1. Macrophages are important in surviving influenza infection mainly due to their role as APCs.  Macrophages are not the only APCs that can initiate an immune response against influenza.  There are also dendritic cells and B cells that do the same thing.  2. There is currently only one serotype of chickenpox virus circulating in humans.  Infection results in immunity to the only virus that is out there.  In addition, you come in contact with chickenpox on a fairly regular basis just by interacting with others.  These secondary exposures continually boost your immunity, and so it is life-long.  Influenza viruses, on the other hand, mutate rapidly from year to year.  Infection with influenza this year may or may not protect you against next year's virus.  It just depends on how much the virus changes during that season.  This is not predictable, but must be continually monitored.

Then you get x times 1 = 5 times 5. that means x=25|`|XHSl0wKzaa	multiply by a common denominator to get rid of the fraction, then solve like normal    x / 5 - 3 = 4  x / 5 = 7 (add 3 to both sides)  x = 35 (multiply both sides by 5)    note: you could also have multiplied by 5 first:  x - 15 = 20 (then add 15)  x = 35     x/5 = 5  multiply both sides by 5:  x = 25    in general, when working with fractional equations, the strategy is to multiply by a common denominator to clear the fractions... this will work even if you have variables in the denominator... the only change will be to make sure to check your solutions to make sure they don't make the denominator equal to 0|`|ngfPNolpaa	First add 3.  x/5 = 7  Multiply  x = 35      x/5 = 5  multiply  x = 25

But how you get a single fraction for the equation, you take two points from your line. Then, you subtract y2 (the y value from the second point) from y1 (the y value from the first point). You do the same for the x values. Then, you put your y value over your x value and simplify your fraction, therefore getting you the slope.|`|CcFH0TLzaa	if you get rise over run its a normal fraction like 1/2 or 5/9  simply rise or go up the amount of the top number or down if negative  then go right or run the bottom number or left if negative|`|CjY63J7paa	i am not sure what is the original problem, and what is your answer?|`|f030b22033deb2b78e1ed51b83cded8faa	You need to show us what you mean. The rise and the run is one fraction its not 2. So if you are getting 2 different fractions then there is something wrong. Maybe you are not simplifying enough.     ex....    rise is 2/3  run is 1/4     so it would look like this... (2/3) / (1/4)      the next step is to invert up the second fraction and multiply.    (2/3)(4/1) = 8/3      so you actualy only get one fraction. does that help???

Since then, the plates have been moving apart, creating the Atlantic Ocean, which is still getting wider.  The Appalachians, meantime, have been eroding away to the small remnants which are seen today.
AA10927246	Think of absolute value as a distance.  Now think of 22 and 50 on a number line.  What point would be the same distance from both those numbers?  It would be the one in the middle, right?    (22 + 50) / 2  = 72/2   = 36    Now turning it around.  If 36 is the middle point, what is the distance to 22 and 50?  It is 14 units each way.  The distance from 36 to 'x' will be 14 units.    In absolute values you would write:  |x - 36| = 14    Check that 22 and 50 are the solutions to that absolute value equation.|`|eHP0e1IZaa	| (x-22)(x-50) + 5 | = 5|`|gExbWnz0aa	if x =22 and x =50 are solutions, then, the equation is  (x -22)(x-50)=0   you want absolute value  solve  |(x-22)(x-50)|=0  or  |x^2 -72x +1100| =0

NbdTgyLPaa	Your problem seems simple enough, except for the confusing way you wrote the velocity.  Were you meaning 1.00102 km/h?  Or 102 km/h?  (In which case what is that 1.00 for?)  Or something else?<br>  <br>  But momentum is mass times velocity. i.e. p = mv.  I am going to assume you meant 102 km/h here.  So since you have both the mass and velocity, you just multiply, p = 695 kg * 102 km/h = 70890 kg*km/h.<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider changing the units on the solution, that is kg*m/s is the more common SI way of expressing momentum, so p = 70890 kg*km/h = (70890 kg*km/h)*(1000 m/km)/(3600 s/h) = 59075/3 kg*m/s or approximately 19,700 kg*m/s.<br>  <br>  The direction of the momentum is easterly, as that is the direction of the velocity.<br>  <br>  For part b, since momentum is the same, we know that (m1)*(v1) = p1 = p2 = (m2)*(v2).  Where the 1s represent the first car, and the 2s represent the second car.  So,<br>  (m1)*(v1) = (m2)*(v2)<br>  v2 = (m1/m2)*(v1)<br>  v2 = (695 kg/2360 kg)*(102 km/h)<br>  v2 = (139/472)*(102 km/h)<br>  v2 = (139/236)*(51 km/h)<br>  v2 is approximately 30.0 km/h

AA10277342	Given:  5x = 700 - 100*sqrt(x)    Move everything to the left side:  5x + 100*sqrt(x) - 700 = 0    Use quadratic formula to solve for "sqrt(x)":    sqrt(x) = (-100 +/- sqrt(100^2 - 4*5*(-700))) / (2*5)  sqrt(x) = (-100 +/- sqrt(100^2 - 4*5*(-700))) / 10  sqrt(x) = (-100 +/- sqrt(24000)) / 10  sqrt(x) = (-100 +/- sqrt(10^3 * 2^3 * 3) / 10  sqrt(x) = (-100 +/- 10*2*sqrt(10 * 2 * 3) / 10  sqrt(x) = (-10 +/- 2*sqrt(10 * 2 * 3)    So, either:  sqrt(x) = -10 - 2*sqrt(60)    However, this is impossible because the  sqrt(x) can't be a negative number.    Therefore, we're left with the *other* solution  of the quadratic equation:    sqrt(x) = -10 + 2*sqrt(60)  x = (-10 + 2*sqrt(60))^2  x = 30.16133230340664918547      To verify 30.16133  5x = 700 - 100sqrt(x)  5*30.16133 = 700 - 100sqrt(30.16133)  150.8066615 = 150.8066615  verified    So, x is approximately 30.16133230340664918547      .

AA11236094	Planck discovered that energy emitted at the atomic level could only be emitted as small, specifically sized packets called quanta.  More formally:    Planck found that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in a multiple of an elementary unit E = h, where h is Planck's constant, also known as Planck's action quantum (introduced in 1899), and  is the frequency of the radiation. This is work for which Planck received the Nobel Prize in Physics  in 1918.    At first Planck considered that quantisation was only "a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it..."; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career.     The full interpretation of the radical implications of Planck's work was advanced by Albert Einstein in 1905for this reason, the philosopher and historian of science Thomas Kuhn has argued that Einstein should be given credit for quantum theory more so than Planck, since Planck did not understand in a deep sense that he was "introducing the quantum" as a real physical entity.     I personally think they should share the credit, but whatever.    The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants.    So, Yea Planck!!    Just as an aside, one of Planck's sons was one of the real life Valkyrie plotters (re the recent movie), and was hanged by the Nazis in 1945 for attempting to murder Hitler.|`|oVz6sPsIaa	For the theory that explained the blackbody radiation spectrum.
He2WsvBcaa	The notation of M means molarity, and molarity is classified as the amount of a solute per liter of solution.  0.5 M means that there are 0.5 mol of salt for every 1 liter of water solution|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	A .5M solution means you have half a mole's worth of solute in your solvent.  Basically, it works like this:    For a 1M solution:  You would take the total molecular weight of solute and add that many grams to 1L of solvent.  The molecular weight is how many grams there are for a mole of that stuff - Avogadro's number of atoms of it.      So, for a .5M solution you can either dilute the 1M solution 1:1 (500ml of the solution to 500ml more water or other solvent if you want 1L), or add half as much of the solute to the 1L of solvent.    Make sense?

z7BiMSWmaa	The term polygenic inheritance is used to refer to the inheritance of quantitative traits, traits which are influenced by multiple genes, not just one. In addition to involving multiple genes, polygenic inheritance also looks at the role of environment in someone's development.    Because many traits are spread out across a continuum, rather than being divided into black and white differences, polygenic inheritance helps to explain the way in which these traits are inherited and focused. A related concept is pleiotropy, an instance where one gene influences multiple traits.    Early Mendelian genetics focused on very simple genetic traits which could be explained by a single gene. For example, a flower might appear in either orange or yellow form, with no gradation between the colors. By studying plants and the ways in which they mutated, early researchers were able to learn more about the gene which determined flower color. However, by the early twentieth century, people were well aware that most traits are far too complex to be determined by a single gene, and the idea of polygenic inheritance was born.    One easily understood example of polygenic inheritance is height. People are not just short or tall; they have a variety of heights which run along a spectrum. Furthermore, height is also influenced by environment; someone born with tall genes could become short due to malnutrition or illness, for example, while someone born with short genes could become tall through genetic therapy. Basic genetics obviously wouldn't be enough to explain the wide diversity of human heights, but polygenic inheritance shows how multiple genes in combination with a person's environment can influence someone's phenotype, or physical appearance.    Skin color is another example of polygenic inheritance, as are many congenital diseases. Because polygenic inheritance is so complex, it can be a very absorbing and frustrating field of study. Researchers may struggle to identify all of the genes which play a role in a particular phenotype, and to identify places where such genes can go wrong. However, once researchers do learn more about the circumstances which lead to the expression of particular traits, it can be a very rewarding experience.    In pleiotropy, on the other hand, one gene is responsible for multiple things. Several congenital syndromes are examples of pleiotropy, in which a flaw in one gene causes widespread problems for a person. For example, sickle cell anemia is a form of pleiotropy, caused by a distinctive mutation in one gene which leads to a host of symptoms.
cGDIG5URaa	I would say B.    Here's what a test cross is:  You have offspring with undetermined genotypes.  If you cross this offspring with a true-breeding (read, homozygous) individual, the offspring of that pairing would reveal the genotype of the parents.    For a practical example: Say you're playing Gregor Mendel with a very large patch of peas.  You have one patch that has, for many many generations, bloomed with white flowers, and one that has bloomed with purple flowers.    You transplant one plant from each plot and cross-polinate them, then plant their seeds.  All of the offspring have purple flowers.  (Assume you did this enough times - on the order of hundreds of plants - to know that your result wasn't a fluke.)    With just these results, we know one of several things could have happened.  First, we could hypothesize that only the purple plants pass on the gene for flower color (and nothing from the white parent plant).  We could also hypothesize that the purple genes "suppress" the white genes (i.e., complete dominance).    How you can test this would be to cross the offspring back with the true-breeding white plant.  If the first hypothesis is correct, all of the offspring would be purple.  If the second hypothesis is correct, some (~50%) of the offspring would have white flowers.    Now that we have worked out the rules of genetics, the more immediate use of test crosses would be to work out the genotype of the unknown parent.  For example, if you have a purple-flowered pea plant, that plant can be either Pp (heterozygous) or PP (homozygous) genotype.  If you cross it with pp (a white-flowered true-breeding plant), you would either get all purple, if the unknown was homozygous (all offspring would be Pp), or half purple and half white, if the plant was heterozygous (Pp x pp would result in half Pp and half pp).    There are other back-crosses that address some of the other choices, but a test cross is generally to detect recessive genes.

For c) i think the answer is you start at the y-intercept and go across the coordinate plane using your slope(or at least something like that?). For d) im going on a wild guess but the rate of change in this situation in this equation would be by hours. As the hours increase, so does the slope because x is both the slope and hours  Note: I pretty much forgot how to do these but i decided to help anyways. The linear equation is right, i think.

The TV camera was mounted on the side of the lunar module, not the moon's surface, for the astronauts' first steps.

The panel held the camera in position and focused onto the ladder.  It allowed us to watch live as Armstrong climbed down the ladder and took man's first step onto another world. Only later when the astronauts were on the surface did they move the camera off the LEM and set it upon a tripod on the moon's surface so we could watch them work.    Edit:  Actually you're partly correct.  As you mentioned, testing the surface first was a concern.  If I recall, Neil Armstrong's first step was actually just a small hop onto the surface then back onto the landing pad while hanging onto the ladder.  That was intended to first test that the surface was strong enough to support his weight and to be certain that he would not sink down into the soil.

	Hi,    If a Regular Polygon has interior angles measuring 140 how many side does the polygon have?    For any regular polygon, the exterior angles always add to 360. If an interior angle is 140, then its exterior angle is 180 - 140 = 40.    Since all exterior angles add to 360, then 360/40 = 9 means there are 9 exterior angles. This also means there would be 9 sides to the polygon.    The polygon has 9 sides     I hope that helps!! :-)

Assume you have 100 g of sample    C = 54.5 % = 54.5 g  N = 31.8 % = 31.8 g  H = 13.6 % = 13.6 g    Now, convert each mass to moles    moles = mass / molar mass  molar mass C = 12.01 g/mol  molar mass N = 14.01 g/mol  molar mass H = 1.008 g/mol    molews C = 54.5 g / 12.01 g/mol = 4.54 mol  moles N = 31.8 g / 14.01 g/mol = 2.27 mol  moles H = 13.6 g / 1.008 g/mol = 13.5 mol    So mole ratio of C : H :N   is  4.54 moles : 13.5 moles : 2.27 moles     Now, to get it to its simplest ratio, divide every number by the smallest number    C : H : N  (4.54 / 2.27) : (13.5 / 2.27) : (2.27 / 2.27)    2 : 6 : 1    The empirical forrmula is  C2H6N    To determine the molecular formula divide the molar mass of teh compound by the formulla weight of teh empirical formula. This tells you how many times the empirical formula fits into the molecular formula.    formula weight C2H6N = 44.1 g/mol    88 g /mol / 44.1 g/mol  = 2    Now multiply the empirical formula by the factor you found    C2H6N x 2    = C4H12N2

If you wanna make good money, you should look towards business. i hope this helped, good luck in your future!|`|92yiQo7uaa	If your a B student or better that's enough for high school.    I'm going to say that you'll owe $120,000 in student loans for all your college costs--bachelors and doctors degree,    Most doc's are at least $180,000 to millions per year depending on spoecialties    free website educationplanner.org has salary info for docs and other jobs|`|PleCBQeqaa	First off, high school doesn't matter when it comes to becoming a doctor, college is all that matters. Do well in college and enter medical school, from there, there is still a long road. Overall, it is:    4 years Undergrad  4 years medical school  3-5 years residency  1-2 years internship  Become a Doctor.    These numbers depend on what field of medicine you'd like to enter, what you'd like to do (surgeon, non-surgeon, diagnostics, pathology) and what you'd like to specialize in (cardiology, neurology, etc).    The cost total is completely random. If you attend a state school and a state medical school, it can be like a max of 50,000 in some cases, if you attend an expensive private college and expensive private med school, you could be owing upwards of 300,000 dollars in the end.    However, salaries for medical doctors are RIDICULOUSLY high. For example, the hospital that my mother works at just hired a brand new interventional radiologist right out of school with a starting salary of 350,000 dollars a year. Don't let anyone tell you the salary isn't worth it, because it is.   The only time the salary isn't really worth it is for family practice doctors who have to pay for their building, all their equipment, and everything else, but they have the least stressful and demanding jobs out of the other specialties.|`|nPt7hUE8aa	You need to major in pre-med/biology. then go to med school, cost varies. so does salaries.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	It takes 11 years to become a doctor,  4 years of college.  4 years of medical school.  3 years of working in a hospital!|`|AA12116854	OMG! It takes AT LEAST 8 to 10 years of study and then an internship in an emergency room! The cost is enormous, I'm sure these days it can run into hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition and you make a piddly amount as both an intern and when and if you start your own practice for several years. The medical malpractice insurance cost alone USED to cost $1 million and that was years ago!  That is one reason healthcare costs are so high, the doctors must protect themselves and they have to pay that million dollar insurance somehow!  In any case, if you are determined to become a doctor, you need to first have a strong ability in mathematics but especially in chemistry from high school onward and of course, your grades should be as good as they can possibly be. You also should contact colleges (community first to cut the costs the first two years for an AA/AS degree and get your basic classes out of the way) and their financial aid offices/counselors who can give you a more accurate idea of what the educational costs would be and how to plot your educational and training course toward your goal.  You might want to pay for college by working as an EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) or Paramedic for an ambulance company which you can do if you take emergency studies at your local community college and would give you an idea of how basic medicine works and you'd have some tangential interaction with ER medicine as well. That would prepare you a bit for your upcoming ER internship.

You tell us the sizes of the tube but not of the rod.  You tell us the conductivity of the rod but not of the tube.  You initially call the rod A but at the very end of your question the tube (cylinder?) has become A.  Your question a) mentions cylinders (plural) so I guess both the rod and the tube are cylinders (?).  So is the cold fluid in contact with the rod as you say (that means the heater is immersed in the fluid) or is the fluid outside the cylinder which seems more likely but is not what you describe?    I am not very motivated to start looking for a solution amidst all this confusion!!

All sides of the Moon receive sunlight (and therefore know day and night). When we see the dark side of the Moon it is still the same side of the Moon facing Earth, but still in night on the Moon.    Now the part of the Moon that you see during crescent phase that is still dark, but brighter than the sky background is illuminated by Earthshine. That is the moon's surface illuminated by sunlight reflected from the Earth illuminating the night portion of the Moon (similar to when we see the night landscape on Earth illuminated by a full moon) then reflected back to us.

09fa12a26541d585c238c7bb5ea61641aa	If  you do the above calculation you get a final temp of 118oC, higher than the original steam temp.  This can't be, and the reason is that not all of the steam condenses.  The remaining mass of steam (water vapor) is the partial pressure of water at the final temp.  I will do more and edit this answer later.    Here is my idea:  The steam will condense until the water reaches 100oC, at which point the water and steam are in equilibrium.  No heat will flow from steam to water or vice versa.  The mass of steam needed to reach that point is    Ms*529=1*200*(100 - 40)    Ms = 22.7 g.  The mass of steam left is then 30 - 22.7 = 7.3g.  The mass of the water is now 200 + 22.7 = 222.7g    If the mass of steam is only 20g, then if all the steam condenses you have    200*(T - 40) = 20*539 + 20(100 - T)    200*t - 8000 = 10780 + 2000 - 20*t    T = 20780/220 = 94.5 oC    However, there is still steam (water vapor) in the container if the water is 94.5 oC, so all of the steam has not condensed.  To compute that is more difficult and would  involve successive approximation because of the non-linear vapor pressure vs temperature curve.

As far as nostra is concerned, the history channel and N.Geo have both basically debunked the methods/predictions he made.     Anybody can make generalizations about a "great war" or "large fire in a big city" and wait hundreds of years for it to come true.    The "predictions" that he made that "came true" during his lifetime were very vague and generalized.    I don't believe for a minute that it's true, rather that the rumor of the end could push society further in that direction (people take these things way too seriously and start taking to the streets with crayola posters warning of apocalypse- it's ridiculous)|`|PR7e81GWaa	All this history is a misinformation campaign from NASA!    It all started when Dr. Robert Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory has some theories about the probable existence of Planet X. Some years later, he left for an expedition to New Zealand from which he believed to be the best place to observe it. After some months of research and observation, he died from a mysterious cancer shortly before announcing his findings. The whole story died with him, and if you look for official information on Dr. Harrington, you will read that he had already discarded the possibility of this planet a few years before their dispatch.    After some years, in 1997, has surged a comet that became famous as the Great Comet of 1997, the Hale-Bopp. Many people believed that this comet was on a collision course with our planet, and even for some time the space observatories were worried, because it really became very close to Earth. Indeed, if he had been here 3 months before, the possibility of a direct collision would be very large. Many comments were made on the comet, and even mysterious about the lack of official information and photos from space agencies regarding it, many other independent and amateur astronomers began to make comments on their own. One independent astronomers photographed what appeared to be a "company" of the comet. According to this picture, it would be a much larger company. This photo was discussed in the Art Bell's radio program, a major critic of NASA and well known in the United States. Few days later, 38 people from a sect called "Heaven's Gate" was found dead by suicide in a house. According to official information, they committed suicide so they could reach such company of the comet, which they believed to be a spaceship that would get them. But the real story was not that well.    Once the news of these deaths cames, Art Bell was blamed by the media to have disclosed to this picture and hence the death of those people, and soon after the NASA confirmed that the photo was false, and that had been manipulated by the person that delivered it to Art Bell. That was a big hit on their behalf, and unfortunately he has not been able to defend itself, since he died of the same mysterious cancer that killed the scientist Robert Harrington. But the photo was genuine, and this whole scheme had been manipulated by NASA and the U.S. department of defense. The "disciples" of the sect were not really religious or anything like that, they were systems developers, and were creating a system of encryption and firewall that even the computers of the office of U.S. defense could break. Were killed one by one in the house where they were found, one after another while going inside. Pictures of the comet and his company were left at the crime scene, and a fake site was created immediately about them. And from there, the whole scheme was created in 2012, because those pictures and information regarding the comet were true, and many other more important things could still be found.    After some years, the name zetatalk appeared on the Internet, according to its creator, Nancy-some-thing, she received telepatic messages from extra-terrestrial beings, which in 2003 warned that a large planet known to us as Nibiru was coming to our Solar System, and would bring with it the apocalypse. Many books and DVDs were sold on the subject for this site. Some time later, Mark Hazzlewood released books on the same subject using data taken from the site zetatalk but eliminating the telepathic contact with aliens to make the story easier.     Many other books and DVDs were sold by him. Of course nothing happened, and now these same people returned to their sites and their books, but this time with a new date: 2012, the year in which the Mayan calendar "ends" and when the holy city of Shamballa would make visible again. It is logical that it is the same campaign which took place earlier. And in that gap of time between 2003 and 2012, much material came from the Internet, and I believe that over 90% came from zetatalk's site and from informations from Mark Hazzlewood's books. The curious thing is that the creator of zetatalk is married to an important person of NASA, and that Mark Hazzlewood moved in with his girlfriend to Canada to get rid of charges related to his books.    Before we go back to the issues of the comet Hale-Bopp and the Planet X, it is important that you know of some studies that were originally developed by Belikovsi and since the 1970s are being performed by Dr. James McCanney. In this model, other than the current model used by scientists to understand the mechanics of celestial bodies, there is what he calls "Electrical Space", where intense interactions of electromagnetic order occurs between them. In this model, although all the theory applied physics is exactly like the current, the electromagnetic interactions between the different celestial bodies count as much of the calculations to be made, not only the

5OYlafG2aa	Depends what you mean by "comes close" and "much smaller".    Think of Earth & Moon system, the Earth has about 80 times the mass of the Moon but is almost 250,000 miles away.   The Moon's gravitational influence on the Earth causes tides to form, and if the Moon had water you'd definitely see major tides there because the Earth is more massive.   Now you don't need water to get tidal bulging, the actual dirt/rock/whatever of a planet can actually do this as well.       In fact a couple of Jupiter's moons have warmer interiors and it's due to this gravitational tidal forces.   Where as our moon, which is much closer to the Sun is quite cold inside.       So to answer your question, yes.

The gravitational interaction would most likely affect tides first at farthest. When close enough, the weather condition would most likely be affected in both planets since the atmosphere receives the energy from the interaction thereby making the atmosphere/weather turbulent and unstable. There's a theory that Triton, Neptune's largest moon is caught in this fashion where the atmosphere of the parent planet received the drag enabling the capture. A little closer and most certainly, for objects of terrestrial nature, geologic activity would most likely affected. Io, Jupiter's moon is an example of an object experiencing this kind of interaction wherein its core is "munched" by its neighbor satellites and Jupiter itself. In a collision, you would most likely know the outcome.|`|eFMrzJOAaa	orbit of small planet will get disturbed.

Each recorded measurement has a certain number of significant digits. Calculations done on these measurements must follow the rules for significant digits. The significance of a digit has to do with whether it represents a true measurement or not. Any digit that is actually measured or estimated will be considered significant. Placeholders, or digits that have not been measured or estimated, are not considered significant. The rules for determining the significance of a digit will follow.    Rules For Significant Digits    Digits from 1-9 are always significant.   Zeros between two other significant digits are always significant   One or more additional zeros to the right of both the decimal place and another significant digit are significant.   Zeros used solely for spacing the decimal point (placeholders) are not significant.

wXlIksDYaa	Hi Dino,      Orbs like the one in your picture is probably dust or a very small piece of lint. Very common in group pictures as people have stirred impurities that float in the air as they gather for the picture or stopped moving moments before.    I have been studying the paranormal for 24 years now. I have seen precious few photos with orbs in them that would make me think spirit. I do believe 98% of orbs in still photos are impurities in the air the flash reflects on, 1.5% are of the ball lightning effect, a build up of energy we happen to catch on film and is nothing more than static energy that floats, then disperses, the last .5% that leaves one scratching their head might be spirit related.     Good luck in the search for answers, take care.|`|BqdqSRvLaa	Your sadly going to hear this over and over.. what you have there is really nothing.. a dust orb thats reflecting like .. thats all you really have ..|`|PpuOab4Gaa	Light refraction.

More proof and evidence of the paranormal than of God, that's for sure.|`|YIy9yu4qaa	actually the culture of "ghost orbs" is just a pop craze. The causes of various "orbs" are very well known to be caused by natural occurances, and there doesn't seem to be any coorelation between orb photos and ghosts. But I suppose its more exciting to believe an orb is caused by a ghost, especially if you are a paranormal investigator. However, I have spent at least the last 10 years of my life focused on photography and videography.   In my opinion, this is not an ordinary dust orb. It looks more consistant with lens glare. My guess is that t he flash was aimed directly at your forehead, and this light reflecting back is what caused the problem.   There is a dust orb to your just above the person to your left, however.     There is no reason to suspect a ghost. Sorry if this ruins your fun.    edit: Kudos to Brodes for calling that one.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I see nothing in that photo which compels me to conclude it even might be what is commonly referred to as an "orb".  I have never seen any orb that can't be attributed to a natural cause.  If you notice, all orb photos are taken with a flash.  This strong light source can reflect off objects (i.e. moisture, dust, etc.) or refract to cause optical artifacts.

I have almost decided that no orbs are paranormal. It took me a while to find the theory of ghost orbs and I did at one time believe some orbs are ghost. After several hundred photos and dozens of investigations I doubt any orb is paranormal. However I have taken pictures of 2 that I still can't say for sure what it is but I no longer claim it is paranormal. The few ghosts I have seen have looked like people not orbs. I am also departing from most paranormal investigators because I don't think ghosts can be photographed and if they can they will look like people.. . when i do photograph a ghost then i will change my mind again.|`|RpDLrPbOaa	It really hard to tell becuse of the glare. Most orbs I see are in the evening or at night. Being it is right on your face and not around or over where most are it is very hard to judge.  If you want you can do a test.  Go out side at night and get a radio. Tune it to a station that all you hear is static and turn it up louder than normal. This is called white noise . The noise will draw spirits, it is a source of energy for them Let it stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes and then start talking to someone who you know has passed. Be serious and talk as if they were there in front of you. Take  a lot od pics with you digital camera.

Split into two binomials.      2x^2+17x+21=0  (2x+3)(x+7)=0  2x+3=0, 2x=-3, x=-1.5  x+7=0, x=-7  The answer is x=-1.5 and -7    Take the first two in the parentheses 2x and x and multiply together=2x^2    Now do the outer.  Which is the first in the first parentheses (2x) and the last in the second parentheses (7).  2x*7=14x  Then do inner.  Which is the last of the first parentheses (3) and the first of the second parentheses (x). 3*x=3x  Then add up the outer and inner. 14x+3x=17x    Last do the last.  The last of the first parentheses (3) and the last of the second parentheses (7)  3*7=21.    Put all of these together and you will get your 2x^2+17x+21.  FOIL is used to break up the polynomial into binomials and vice versa.    To be honest this is difficult to explain by typing.

Using the familiar:    Torque = r x F     Size of torque = r * F * sin (angle between them)      the cross product is zero when the angle between them is 180 degrees.

This means the NET ionic equation will be the same as the total ionic equation.    molecular equation    Ba(OH)2(aq) + H2SO4(aq) ------> BaSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)    Total ionic equation (split all the (aq) solution into their constituent ions) eg BaSO4(aq) ----> Ba2+(aq) + SO4(2-)(aq)    Ba2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) + 2H+(aq) + SO4(2-)(aq) ---> BaSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)      Net ionic equation - leave out the spectator ions - these are ions that are exactly the same on both sides of the equation. In this case there are none. So NET ionic is same as total ionic.

Either the agar was contaminated or there was contamination somewhere within the production of the plates.  If you made these plates yourself, then contamination is the best reason. Also if you have the plates upside down in the fridge, then air can still diffuse into the plates and growth can occur.   Another reason could be that your antibiotics just were bad when you made the plates (assuming you made antibiotic plates).  good luck.
PR7e81GWaa	All this history is a misinformation campaign from NASA!    It all started when Dr. Robert Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory has some theories about the probable existence of Planet X. Some years later, he left for an expedition to New Zealand from which he believed to be the best place to observe it. After some months of research and observation, he died from a mysterious cancer shortly before announcing his findings. The whole story died with him, and if you look for official information on Dr. Harrington, you will read that he had already discarded the possibility of this planet a few years before their dispatch.    After some years, in 1997, has surged a comet that became famous as the Great Comet of 1997, the Hale-Bopp. Many people believed that this comet was on a collision course with our planet, and even for some time the space observatories were worried, because it really became very close to Earth. Indeed, if he had been here 3 months before, the possibility of a direct collision would be very large. Many comments were made on the comet, and even mysterious about the lack of official information and photos from space agencies regarding it, many other independent and amateur astronomers began to make comments on their own. One independent astronomers photographed what appeared to be a "company" of the comet. According to this picture, it would be a much larger company. This photo was discussed in the Art Bell's radio program, a major critic of NASA and well known in the United States. Few days later, 38 people from a sect called "Heaven's Gate" was found dead by suicide in a house. According to official information, they committed suicide so they could reach such company of the comet, which they believed to be a spaceship that would get them. But the real story was not that well.    Once the news of these deaths cames, Art Bell was blamed by the media to have disclosed to this picture and hence the death of those people, and soon after the NASA confirmed that the photo was false, and that had been manipulated by the person that delivered it to Art Bell. That was a big hit on their behalf, and unfortunately he has not been able to defend itself, since he died of the same mysterious cancer that killed the scientist Robert Harrington. But the photo was genuine, and this whole scheme had been manipulated by NASA and the U.S. department of defense. The "disciples" of the sect were not really religious or anything like that, they were systems developers, and were creating a system of encryption and firewall that even the computers of the office of U.S. defense could break. Were killed one by one in the house where they were found, one after another while going inside. Pictures of the comet and his company were left at the crime scene, and a fake site was created immediately about them. And from there, the whole scheme was created in 2012, because those pictures and information regarding the comet were true, and many other more important things could still be found.    After some years, the name zetatalk appeared on the Internet, according to its creator, Nancy-some-thing, she received telepatic messages from extra-terrestrial beings, which in 2003 warned that a large planet known to us as Nibiru was coming to our Solar System, and would bring with it the apocalypse. Many books and DVDs were sold on the subject for this site. Some time later, Mark Hazzlewood released books on the same subject using data taken from the site zetatalk but eliminating the telepathic contact with aliens to make the story easier.     Many other books and DVDs were sold by him. Of course nothing happened, and now these same people returned to their sites and their books, but this time with a new date: 2012, the year in which the Mayan calendar "ends" and when the holy city of Shamballa would make visible again. It is logical that it is the same campaign which took place earlier. And in that gap of time between 2003 and 2012, much material came from the Internet, and I believe that over 90% came from zetatalk's site and from informations from Mark Hazzlewood's books. The curious thing is that the creator of zetatalk is married to an important person of NASA, and that Mark Hazzlewood moved in with his girlfriend to Canada to get rid of charges related to his books.    Before we go back to the issues of the comet Hale-Bopp and the Planet X, it is important that you know of some studies that were originally developed by Belikovsi and since the 1970s are being performed by Dr. James McCanney. In this model, other than the current model used by scientists to understand the mechanics of celestial bodies, there is what he calls "Electrical Space", where intense interactions of electromagnetic order occurs between them. In this model, although all the theory applied physics is exactly like the current, the electromagnetic interactions between the different celestial bodies count as much of the calculations to be made, not only the|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end).

It's a fringe group of people.     2012 is nothing but a pop culture myth. It has no basis in fact.|`|AA11029380	Since the 2012 rumor is just that, it has nothing to do with today, tomorrow or anything.|`|2JeCyjF8aa	2012 relates to today in that for thousands of years before us there have been great civilizations that have been keeping track of time, they have kept track of time by observing astronomical cycles. For example the Mayan calendar which is the most discussed regarding  2012 is a cyclical calendar that NEVER ends, it keeps repeating itself, the logic that went into designing the calendar was to track time so accurately that we would be able to foretell evolutionary changes of humans and Earth by observing astronomical changes in space and documenting it in calendars. It is only because of our useless calendar that has no relevance to time whatsoever that we have turned time into something meaningless other than being able to serve the purpose of keeping our societies and structures in order.  People believe the Mayan calendar is bullshit, and that its ending in 2012 means nothing, well first off, the calendar doesnt end at all, it repeats itself, it only ends its 25,625 year cycle which is relevant to some astronomical occurence that was documented with the creation of the calendar, with the end of these large cycles or even the smaller cycles within it, the Mayans believed the Earth went through evolutionary changes because of some occurence in space that they had seen time and time again and decided it was an accurate marker for a cycle. In fact the mayans believed the Earth had been destroyed and re-created several times before, each causing a shift in evolution on Earth, things die...new things are reborn stronger and more fit to survive, whether physically or in some spiritual sense. The only misinterpretation of the calendar is whether or not the Mayan calendar actually ends its cycle on Dec. 21 2012, given that that calendar was translated and could have been mistranslated. During the spanish invasion of what is now Mexico, Central and South America many artifacts relating to the significance of the calendar were burned as the spanish saw this as witchcraft nonsense, this is actually where out culture gets its ignorance in believing the calendar is some astrological meaningless depiction of time, take into consideration that the "predictions" or more like calculations of time have been accurate for thousands of years, there has never been an event that hasnt been correct when we follow the Mayan calendar, it is actually considered the most accurate calendar ever created. There is lots of relevant ideas that come from the 2012 prophecy, consider for many years we have been told of some "big one" earthquake that is supposed to devastate california, well it just so happens that this is believed to be the end of the 5th sun, Earth will be destroyed once again and once again evolutionary changes will occur, this time it is prophecized that Earthquakes will be the main cause of destruction(this comes straight off the Aztec calendar, I am not making this up), consider for many years that we have been warned by our government that we are on the verge of another ice age and that we must go green in order to slow down the process, consider the catastrophes they have warnes us will happen when it gets here, consider the money trail, consider the evil tendencies of politics to manipulate things to their advantage, consider that the Mayan calendar is just one of many different sources that speak of an"end time" in which humanity will be tested once again, and once again a divine interaction will unfold and this will bring us supreme knowledge as we evolve consciously by observinng some phenomena that hasnt been seen for tens of thousands of years. People cant believe in something when they dont take the time to learn about it before first knocking it down as a hoax or hogwash or charlatan bs, there is nothing bs about dozens of civilizations tracking time and perfecting it in a way that we are unable to do because science has hindered our perspective and driven us into some idealistic way of thinking...in which nothing that cant be validated scientifically deserves to have any valid attention drawn to it. To ignore something simply because we are afraid of what it is saying, or because we cant come up with a way to test it and prove it is to say that we are all knowing and that we cant be wrong. Believe what you want, but I will believe that for thousands and thousands of years before us, the people that lived  were far from primitive, if they were so primitive and clueless then why are they the basis for mathematics and why were they able to build such perfected temples and structures that we cant even re-create today if we wanted to. We only believe they are wrong about some life altering event because we are so arrogant o believe that no civilization has ever been greater than ours, well it is apparant alone from the pyramids of giza, the Mayan pyramids, the aztec pyramids, the Inca civilizations, the Olmec civilizations, and many more that these people had some advanced knowledge or technology that enabled them to do such great things.  Believe that humanity will be tested soon, you can either comply with nature or nature will destroy you, the test has already begun with the financial collapse, this is our warning to get on track with nature to avoid annihilation. Its your choice what you want to do, in the end your life will either be spared or it wont, millions will be spared, billions wont. Think about that, people will die for the future benfit of humanity, do you want to live and be a part of a golden age or be part of the sacrifice.|`|PX8ouaC4aa	Actually that's wrong at the beginning, it's not "most people" who think this.

xpyQZba7aa	Fe(s) + 2HCl (aq) --> FeCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)    a) You need to determine the moles of H2 formed in the reaction  using the gas equation    PV = nRT    P = pressure  V = volume ( 62.0 ml = 0.0620 L)  n = moles = unknown  T = temp in deg Kelvin (Kelvin = deg C + 273.15)  R = gas constant. This is different for different units of Volume and pressure, see link for different values)    Now, I am not sure exactly what SLC is. I assume it stands for Standard laboratory conditions. According to wikki this is 25 deg C (298.15 Kelvin) and 100 kPa (0.9869 atm) (are you game enough to trust wikki)     If using Litres and Atm R = 0.0821 L atm mol^-1K^-1    Solve the equation for n  n = PV / RT    n = (0.9869 atm x 0.062 L) / (298.15 K x 0.0821 L atm mol^-1K^-1)  n = 0.00250 moles H2    Then you can convert moles of H2 to mass using  mass = molar mass x moles  molar mass H2 = 2.016 g/mol  mass H2 formed = 2.016 g/mol x 0.00250 mol  = 0.00504 g    b). Now you know that you produced 0.00250 moles of H2  Use the balanced equation to determine how many moles of Iron must have reacted to form this much H2    The equation shows us that  1 mole of H2 forms from 1 mole of Fe (and 2 moles HCl)    So if you formed 0.00250 mol H2 you must have used 0.00250 mol Fe    mass = molar mass x moles  molar mass Fe = 55.85 g/mol  mass Fe = 0.00250 mol x 55.85 g/mol  = 0.140 g    c) Since there is excess HCl you must assume that all of the Fe in the sample reacts. So if all teh Fe has reacted then there was 0.140 g of Fe in the alloy    % Fe = mass Fe / mass alloy x 100 / 1  = 0.140 g / 0.160 g x 100/1  = 87.5 % Fe in the alloy

LTKohWZKaa	your curve is y=x^3    the derivative of y tells us the slope of the tangent at any point (x) on that curve    the derivative of your curve is dy/dx=3x^2    (remember to multiply by the power and reduce the power by one) when you get more advanced in calculus you will learn that this is just a quick way of fiddleing about to get the same as the derivative (thats for another day... lol)    aaanyway...    so we know that the slope of the tangent at any point x on the curve is 3x^2    we dont want to know it for ALL x on the curve, we want to know it at x=0.5    so simply whack in the value 0.5    so dy/dx at x=0.5 is 3(0.5^2)=0.75    since we want to know the equation for the tangent at 0.5 we have just worked out the slope of the line.     So the equation for ANY straight line is y=mx+c    we know m is the slope, so m=0.75    we need to now work out the 'c'    in order to work out c we will need to know a point on the equation of the line. A point we already have a bit of info about is the point where x=0.5    to find out the y coordinate of that point sub in x=0.5 to the origonal curve equation     we are doing this because x=0.5 is also on the curve since it is the point where the curve and the line meet    so we can see that y=0.5^3=0.125    so finally we know a point on our straight line is (0.5,0.125)  so y=0.75x+c  0.125=0.75*0.5 + c  gives us c=0.125-0.375    which is c=-0.25    so the equation of the tangent to the curve at x=0.5 is    y=0.75x-0.25        I'm not sure what you mean by tangent line approimation of 0.63?|`|c11SdnCZaa	You need an equation to find the tangent line.

2YkEQrmvaa	Stem cells are undifferentiated cells.  That means it's basically a blank, generic cell that hasn't decided what kind of cell it will yet.  It could be a skin cell, a neuron, a muscle cell, and so on.    The Pros: we can learn a lot from them about how cells differentiate, how development occurs, and how we can use stem cells to help disease.  For example, if someone has a disease where their muscles break down, can we use stem cells to make them new muscle?    The Cons:  There are several types of stem cells, but the best ones for this kind of work are called embryonic stem cells, meaning they come from embryos (that's the stage of development before the fetus).  Right now, they are unused embryos from in vitro fertilization ("test tube babies" where couples who can't get pregnant have the sperm fertilize the egg in a dish and the embryos that are formed are implanted into the woman.)  There are leftover embryos that are frozen, and those are what we use to get embryonic stem cells.  The question is: when does human life begin?  Is this ethical?  And if this research continues, will more embryos be created?|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Basically stem cell research is a undefined cell.  This means that the cell can be adapted to fight of other diseases.  This is a good thing for humans in the future as well as now.  Your anti argument will be where stem cells were found.  Doctors took them out of un born fetuses (babies that were not born completely)  But now we can take them out of skin and the male testies.  Stem cell research is a great thing for mankind and will hopefully cure many diseases and help fight of infections in humans.
yR75rXThaa	Slightly closer than the Helix nebula is the less fancy-named planetary nebula called SH 2-216 which is between 390-425 depending on who does the parallax calculations. It's bigger than the Helix Nebula, but it's a lot older and a lot more faint so it's not as well known. It's so old that it has expanded so far over the years to be extremely diffuse and dim.    One interesting thing about it is it takes up 1.6 degrees of the sky (appears bigger than the moon!) but it's so faint you can't see it with the naked eye.    The biggest nebula in Earth's sky is the nearly invisible planetary nebula that is 2 degrees across that was only discovered a few years ago. They're still not sure if this new nebula called "Hewett 1" is closer than SH 2-216 yet or not, but it probably sits around 500 light years away.

AA10935727	Things are not really "to do" with science, it is the other way round. Things are discovered, assembled, measured by the application of science but the weather, electricity the environment. They all exist without the invent of science.    Science is simply the business of determining how nature behaves. So in that context, science can be applied to EVERYTHING.    For example, if you brother or sister ran around the block and you were timing it to see how fast he or she runs. Then you would be measuring his time, which is an act of science. You see a bird out of the window and you write it down, you have made an "observation", which is a science.    Radio, farming, laser, internet, telephone. They all came from the application of science on our natural surroundings if you are looking for a simple less philosophical approach to the answer.

You know the initial vertical velocity (V1), the initial vertical height (D), and the vertical acceleration (g). However, Initial velocity, acceleration, and distance are negative because they point downwards and you are dropping something from that distance. You are looking for V2.    You use this equation to solve for V2, and then plug in the rest.    (V2)^2 = (V1)^2 + 2ad  (V2)^2 = 64 - 19.62(-15)  (V2)^2 = 358.3   V2 = 18.9 m/s downwards      b) How long does it take (in seconds) for the stone to hit the ground?    For this one, you need to know time. You can calculate time by this equation:    d = V1t + 0.5at^2  -15 = -8t - 4.905t^2    You can now use the quadratic equation or a calculator quadratic program to find t.    t = 1.11 seconds      Hope this helped.

5B5pirFWaa	To add onto what Peter said is    Three factors affect the density of water  Salinity  Temperature  Pressure  The higher the salinity, the lower the temperature, the higher the pressure, the denser the water.    You take the Volume of the Submarine and the equal volume of water. If the Submarine weighs more that that volume of water it will float, if it weighs less, it will sink.     Now the denser the water is, the heavier it will be for the same volume of water compared to water with less density. The USN measures water density by cubic foot, roughly 68 lbs for 35ppt salinty in the ocean at 50 degrees. As the three variables change, the submarine will tend to become "light" or "heavy" and will compensate by moving water into or out of variable ballast tanks to have the same density//volume as the water.    The same idea works with surface ships, but instead of total volume of the ship, you measure the displaced volume and use the total weight of the ship (you will always see ships size with displacement listed) referenced to the same water/weight volume to determine if the ship will float.|`|t1zlbOURaa	If the vessel weighs less than the same volume of water, it will float, more and it will sink.    With submarines the challenge is to make the ship neutrally buoyant so it will stay where it is put under water.

If you are asking regarding the area to which it's native, it's from Europe and Asia but has been introduced to the US.  But the extent of the spread and when it arrived at different regions might only be able to be discovered from herbarium records or journals of early botanists in an area (since you mention this being for an historical project).    But within the US, the places from which it's been reported are http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?k... - tansy    If you want to explore further the occurrence of the tansy where the range overlaps the other species, if you move the cursor over the range map, you'll see the source of the data for each state.

ku2tP4eEaa	White-tailed deer do not see in colors.  They do see in every shade from white to black.  They have no color receptor rods in the eye.    http://www.atsko.com/articles/hunting/ho...|`|lhiS83ojaa	Not really. They're dichromats, meaning that the color-detecting cone cells in their retinas contain two visual pigments, blue-sensitive and green-sensitive. (Normal humans are trichromats, with three visual pigments.) Deer would be able to discriminate shades of blue and blue-green from other colors but would have trouble distinguishing colors in the green-to-red range. Reds would look black or dark gray, and some greens would be indistinguishable from white. This would be very similar to the color vision deficiency in humans known as protanopia.    In deer and other nocturnal to crepuscular animals, the cone cells are greatly outnumbered by rod cells that give them "black and white" vision. With the help of the reflective tapetum lucidum layer that produces that eerie "eyeshine" in a car's headlights, their night vision is far superior to ours. (We're not only night-blind compared to deer but colorblind compared to many other animals. Most birds have four types of visual pigments, Australian lungfish have five, and mantis shrimps have more than ten.)    That's how. Why, as evolutionary biologists usually explain it, starts with our distant mammalian ancestors, who were little guys that came out mainly at night to stay out of the way of predators such as dinosaurs. They descended from reptiles that would have had good color vision, but at some point they lost all but two of the genes that code for visual pigments. Think of this as a cost-saving measure - it cut out the less useful color-detecting cells and made more room in the retina for the more useful night-vision cells.     Once the dinos were out of the way, the early mammals radiated to fill many niches, both diurnal and nocturnal. In most of those niches, including large herbivores such as deer, the long lost visual pigments weren't missed much. When our Old World primate ancestors took to the trees, a few mutants that produced a new kind of yellow/red-sensitive pigment had an advantage in detecting the ripest fruits and most succulent (and least toxic) young leaves. They survived better and produced more offspring than their red-blind (dichromat) relatives and became the founders of our family line.

So 2.5 would be 2 + 1/2    Now make 2 into a fraction such that it's denominator (the lower number) is the same as the 1/2.    So 4/2 = 2  because if you divide 2 into 4 you get 2.  It gets a bit confusing because there are so many 2's floating around.    so 2.5 = 4/2 + 1/2.    Now when adding fractions with the same denominator you simply add the numerator (top number) together and your answer will be what that addition is with the shared denominator.   In this case (4+1) / 2 or 5/2

rdENr9BWaa	Well to explain this you have to understand a little bit about what temperature actually is.  Temperature is just a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules.  Remember, all molecules are in motion, even atoms in solids are vibrating in place.  So basically, the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules are moving and the more energy they have.  Enzymes just help lower the amount of energy necessary for a reaction to occur, so as temperature increases, all the molecules have more energy, and therefore more reactions are occurring.  This allows respiration to occur faster, giving the peas more ATP (energy) and they can grow faster.|`|OXw0rv4Saa	Enzymes have a very specific temperature range that they are effective in- when they get too cold they don't function efficiently.

fec9977a5483ec366a466856bafd9b4daa	There are some variations, but the process goes like this:    1. DNA is transcribed to  "messenger RNA".  2. The RNA is editted, and "introns" are removed by splicing.  3. The RNA goes to an organelle called a ribosome, which reads it 3 base pairs at a time.  4. So-called "transfer RNAs", which are specific to different amino acids, carry them to the ribosome.  5. The ribosome picks the appropriate amino acid for the current base triplet of the messenger RNA, and adds it to the protein.    There are some other details like "chaperonins" which help fold proteins correctly after they're made, but that's the basics.|`|1gWJzD4Caa	Hi there, and good question. It starts off with you breathing in oxygen. I wont go all in detail even though I could so I will skip to the key parts. When that oxygen is in the blood and goes to your organs and tissue, in that process it is absorbed by your cells, at least parts of the blood. Not all the blood but different elements of it. Then it transports to the ribosomes within every cell. By the way another thing to point out is that when a cell is created in your body it comes with all the organelles already in place once it's complete such as gulgi apparatus, reticulum types, ribosomes, etc. so while it is stored in the ribosomes the DNA undergoes activities with the three types of RNA. Again I wont get into detail but the last RNA type in the cycle for a proetein to occur happens in the ribosomes and "tells" directs the activity of the molecular reaction that occurs in the ribosomes resulting in the production of the most common proetein in humans which would be glucose. That is your process from frant to end. Im sorry it is so long and complicated but i you try to shorten it anymore then it already has then i would really not be telling the actual function occuring and it would be a totally wrong answer without those key step. thank you, and good luck.

In addition to the LN2 and LO2 the other guys mention, hydrocarbon gases are also frequently made into liquids. LPG is of a composition that it liquefies at low pressures. LNG is natural gas that is very cold so that it becomes a liquid so that a lot can be shipped in a tanker.    Industrial users also make solids into liquids for transport in pipelines. For example, coal slurries are often used. Coal is ground up into dust, and mixed with water, and can then be pumped through pipelines. There are other types of slurries, such as wood chips/water in paper mills, sand/water mixture in dredging machines.    You can also heat some solids to make liquids for pumping.

Intrusive forms when magma cools inside the Earth. Some examples of igneous rock are granite (intrusive) and basalt (extrusive).  Sedimentary- Forms when sediments get compacted and cemented together. Follow the law of superposition, which means that the oldest layer is on the bottom and the youngest layer is on the top. The only rock layer that contains fossils. They can be easily broken down into sediments. Examples include limestone and sandstone.  Metamorphic- Forms when rocks change in chemical and physical structure from extreme heat and pressure. All rocks and go through metamorphism. The temperatures are greater than 150-200 degrees C with pressures of at least 1500 bars. Some examples are marble and slate.    2.http://www.learner.org/interactives/rock...  or http://www.okaloosa.k12.fl.us/technology...    3. Chemical and mechanical.

It's just their philosophies are a little different    Osteopathy is an approach to healthcare that emphasizes the role of the musculoskeletal system in health and disease    In most countries, osteopathy is a form of complementary medicine, emphasizing a holistic approach and the skilled use of a range of manual and physical treatment interventions in the prevention and treatment of disease.     In practice, this most commonly relates to musculoskeletal problems such as back and neck pain.     Osteopathic principles teach that treatment of the musculoskeletal system (bones, muscles and joints) facilitates the recuperative powers of the body.    The American osteopathic medical degree (DO) has identical training requirements and practice rights as the MD degree    Comparison of MD and DO in the United States. Look at this link to see the differences    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_...    MD are called Allopathic medical doctors. Primary they are more concerned with Evidence-based medicine (EBM). It  aims to apply evidence gained from the scientific method to certain parts of medical practice.     It seeks to assess the quality of evidence relevant to the risks and benefits of treatments (including lack of treatment).     According to the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, "Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	They are both qualified to practice medicine.

aIZ82X0raa	A pollutant could be carbon monoxide, in living organisms such as ourselves we have red blood cells which "carry" oxygen, it does this due to the protein complex of haemoglobin inside the red blood cells (erythrocytes). Oxygen binds to the protein as it has an affinity for O2. Then as it travels round the body it is released into the muscles and cells that need oxygen for aerobic respiration. CO has a higher affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen does, this causes an irreversible bond to the haemoglobin molecule which means the red blood cell can no longer carry oxygen. CO is just one example. You could also talk about green house gases such as carbon dioxide and methane being a pollutant but it does not affect the cells directly but by causing a change in climate it can cause dessification in certain areas of the environment which would cause death in the inhabitant organisms of that area. Sulphur in the air is also harmful as it can cause acid rain, which can damage and destroy plant life as well.    To sum up, pollutants can cause undesired effects on organisms which can interrupt the usual cell respiration or life of that cell. If the environmental conditions are not favoured then it can be harmful.  I hope you get the gist of what im trying to say?

The moist atmosphere 'holds back' the evaporation rate of the sweat.  The dry air will evaporate more sweat from your body than will moist air.

But SomeGuy mentions that it feels harder to breathe in humid air and that contributes a lot to feeling uncomfortable.  I believe that smothering feeling is related to another way our bodies cool themselves:  insensible perspiration--in this case, water vapor which passes mostly from our respiratory system as we exhale.  (It's why we can 'see our breath' on a cold day and fog up windows in a car.)  The humid air is not as good a receiver of vapor from our lungs because it's already nearing saturation--like a sponge that's already wet.  So that's another reason 'dry heat' is generally preferred over humid heat.

We would have to find a way to from clouds that cause rain. It would take millions of years for us to come up with this technology.

Thirdly, our galaxy the milky way is on a collision course with our sister galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy. This will cause a merge in the galaxies in which there is a very high chance that there will be other solar systems near us with planetary characteristics almost exactly like earth.

The last two years are clinical, and you are expected to take call as part of your training.

S8H5yYcoaa	The speed is just a simple multiplication - you're given that it's .998c, and that c=3*10^8 m/s, so  speed = .998c = .998*3*10^8 m/s = 2.994*10^8 m/s.    Momentum is velocity times mass - magnitude of momentum is simply speed times mass.  We've just calculated the speed, and the mass is given, so  |momentum| = speed*mass = (2.994*10^8 m/s)*(9*10^-31 kg) = 2.994*9*10^8*10^-13 kg*m/s = (2.449*9)*10^(8+-31) kg*m/s = 22.041*10^-23 kg*m/s = 2.2041*10^-24 kg*m/s.    Momentum is also magnitude of momentum put in the direction of the velocity - you're already given this direction in unit vector form (you can check that .588^2 + (-.784)^2 + (-.196)^2 = ~1 - it's approximate because of course they're rounding each of the coordinates to 3 significant figures), so multiplying by this vector of magnitude 1 will not affect the magnitude, only give the correct direction (if you had not the unit vector, but another vector, you'd have to calculate the vector's magnitude and divide by that to compensate).  As they allow you to leave it in factored form, you don't even have to multiply out the terms here:  momentum = |momentum|*direction = (2.2041*10^-24 kg*m/s)* = 2.2041*10^-24 kg*m/s.

qqoHyFakaa	how about doing it on genetics?    get some fruit flies (they're very cheap) and breed them for recesssive genes like short wings, white eyes, red eyes, etc.    you can then do a punnet square and calculate rates of mutation in controlled populations.    this is a common experiment, but it's not something i got to do until college so it should work great for someone in 9th grade.|`|cpiddNaNaa	Well if your school has gel electrophoresis boxes, you can order some enzymes from a company like bio-rad, use the enzymes on the DNA, run the gel, stain it, and blow your teacher away! It should cost less than $50 if your school provides the electrophoresis boxes. Micropipets are also a must for what the school provides. Without the machine or the micropipets, to purchase them will be anywhere from $1000-$5000 so that would be just a tiny bit over budget. My school has them so yours might too. good luck!
ufJd5wtnaa	There is no way to figure out your genotype. As of right now of course. The only way to do this is to guess, using your phenotype. For instance, lets say that the gene that allows you to roll your tongue is R dominant and if you can't roll your tongue, it is gene r recessive. Yes R and r are different. If you can roll your tongue, you could have the genotype of RR or Rr. As long as you have at least one dominant gene, you will have the dominant phenotype. People who can't roll their tongue are rr. The only way for the recessive gene to appear is if you have two recessive genes and no dominant.|`|nuctW71oaa	Give it 10 years and for the price of $1000 US.

Gnfc4wRlaa	While most galaxies are rushing away as the universe expands, Andromeda is the only big spiral galaxy galaxy moving towards the Milky Way. The best explanation is that the two galaxies are in fact a bound pair in orbit around one another. Both galaxies formed close to each other shortly after the Big Bang initially moving apart with the overall expansion of the universe. But since they are bound to one another, they are now falling back back together and one very plausible scenario puts them on a collision course in 3 billion years.    As Andromeda approaches, it will grow in size and just before the collision the night sky will be filled by a giant spiral galaxy. When the two galaxies intersect, our familiar Milky Way arch over the sky will be joined by a second intersecting arch of stars but this will only last for 100 million years or so and will be a very confusing state of affairs for galactic astronomers. Finally, when the two galaxies merge our view will depend on which direction the Sun is thrown. There are two possible fates for the Sun which depend closely on the details of where it is in its galactic orbit at the time of the collision. In the first case the Sun may take a ride on a tidal tail and be ejected into the darkness of intergalactic space. In this case, our star would be all alone with few stellar neighbours so the night sky would be very dark with few stars to see.    In the second case, the Sun may be thrown right into the centre of the merging pair where a great starburst will be underway. The huge number of stars forming will result in supernovae going off at a rate of a few per year in the new merged galaxy. While these will likely not present a direct hazard to the Earth, they will truly light up the sky letting you read at night but probably frustrating the endeavours of backyard astronomers!     The final result will likely be a new elliptical galaxy.|`|jSPj3S6faa	I'm against it.|`|gAzb5PAbaa	I won't be alive to see it.

I havent found anyone who will give me a realistic vision of now much less in the future.|`|E0U2yII3aa	Actually I will probably hate to live on an elliptical galaxy. The collision will ruin the grand design spiral between the two large galaxies. But there are a few good things about it:    1. As the two galaxies near each other, you will be able to see the Andromeda Galaxy as a bright large object in the nightsky. As it approaches closer, some of its stars will be visible even in daylight. The merging process will create starburst formation and will create plenty of massive stars to illuminate the night sky.    2. A more massive end-product galaxy is more resistant to galactic cannibalism. Imagine having a very large elliptical galaxy. Any galaxy that comes our way will be crushed and incorporated into the system rather than destroy ours.    3. And we get to change the way our galaxy looks if we get tired of the spiral look.    The bad points:    1. The grand barred spiral design will be destroyed and the very, very long process of merging will distort the shape of the galaxy.    2. The merging process will exhaust all the gas and dust supply of both galaxies eventually leading to a halt in star formation. The night sky will be filled with yellowish and reddish stars instead. Prett boring for a stargazing.|`|nYirFGvqaa	you must have watched the Science channel tonight.    Very little chance human life will be around to see it.

2YkEQrmvaa	Depends on where:    In general, mitosis would be faster because it's only one division rather than 2.    HOWEVER, many organisms (I'll focus on humans) arrest the cells in the gonads during meiosis.  Females are born with all their eggs, all arrested in prophase I.  They won't complete meiosis I until they are ovulated, and won't complete meiosis II unless they are fertilized, so technically that process could take 12 years or 50 years!|`|ufJd5wtnaa	Although Meiosis and Mitosis sound the same, well, they mostly are the same....    Here are the main main differences of Mitosis and Meiosis    In mitosis, two cells are formed. Each cell has 46 chromosomes, just like the original cell, where in Meiosis, 4 cells are formed, each one with 23 chromosomes. These are called Gametes are For Meiosis, in men the gametes are called sperm and in females they are called eggs.    The steps of Mitosis are Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, and then Cytokenisis    The steps of Meiosis fall under two catagories: Meiosis 1 and Meiosis 2. In Meiosis 1, the steps are Prophase 1, Metaphase 1, etc... and in Meiosis 2, the steps are Prophase 2, Metaphase 2, etc...    Meiosis 2 is EXACTLY like Mitosis. Only two cells are splitting at once.     In Prophase of Mitosis, not much happens besides the centrioles and the spindle fibers forming. In Prophase 1 or Meiosis 1, not only to centrioles and spindle fibers form, also homologus chromosomes pair up. Homologus Chromosomes are consisted of two pairs of sister chromatids. Also, crossing over can occur during prophase, in which the sister chromatids of one side of the Homologus pair switch parts, or "toes" with it's pair. The sister chromatids are no longer identical.       In Meiosis 1, during Anaphase1, instead of Sister Chromatids being pulled apart, homologus pairs are pulled apart.       Mitosis occurs pretty much everywhere in your body, except for some special places, like nerves.    Meiosis only occurs in sex organs, for males the testicles, and for females, the ovaries.       If you stop doing Mitosis, you DIE  If you stop doing Meiosis, you don't die, but you can't have any children.    Hope this helps!|`|9emBySataa	I don't know for sure but mitosis most likely faster because meiosis has to go through meiosis 1 and meiosis 2. Both of  which, as you probably know, include the four stages (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telephase) that only occurs once in mitosis.|`|cpiddNaNaa	Reguardless of which process is faster, there is something you need to know. Mitosis produces a duplicate cell (cell with exact same DNA and 46 chromosomes). In meiosis, the chromosomes can "translocate" (or part of one switches with part of another). You get 4 cells, but they each have random 23 chromosomes in each, instead of the same 46 produced in Mitosis. These cells with 23 chromosomes are called "gametes" or sex cells (sperm and egg). 2 VERY different processes.

This would make the second equation y=x-7. Then, switch x and y. This makes the equation x=y-7. Y= -7, so if you plug that in, you should get x= -14.

Time is only a figment of your imagination.

I do not believe that God is omnipotent. The reason being is the greater the handicap of the creator, the greater the creation.

The Big Bang Theory states that 13.7 (approximately) billion years ago, all of the matter we see in the universe was condensed into a single, infinitesimal, incredibly dense point, called a 'singularity'.     Eventually, this singularity 'exploded' (this isn't accurate, but it's the best term in the English language).     Galaxies give off a particular color depending upon how far away from us they are. Scientists have noticed one thing: these galaxies are spreading out farther. We apply this in reverse, we logically conclude that at one point in time, everything was in this singularity.     There is also "cosmic background radiation" left over from the 'Big Bang' - exactly what the theory predicts. Basically observations suggest that the universe began around 13.7 billion years ago. Since then, the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases. The very early universe, which is still poorly understood, was the split second in which the universe was so hot that particles had energies higher than those currently accessible in particle accelerators on Earth.|`|W2suykEtaa	"God" is an answer, just not a very good one.    the next question would be "How was God created?"    if you answer "He wasn't created" then I would wonder why you thought the Universe needed to be?    we can trace back the Universe to within  a few micro-seconds of the beginning.... with pretty good confidence that something like that actually occurred.

YIy9yu4qaa	No, I don't think it is possible, or at least so improbably that I doubt it would ever happen.   There are several ideas about the source of spontaneous human combustion. One is that an event which causes a traumatic firing of neurological synapses can trigger a chain reaction releasing oxygen and hydrogen in the body causing it to ignite and burn.   All documented cases I have heard of seem to have a source of possible ignition, such as a cigarette or candle.  Also, according to the theories of SHC, the surrounding materials such as clothing, furniture and rugs, should not burn up with SHC, however, in all documented possible cases that I have heard of this has not been the case.   I think the Wick Effect is a more accurate and scientific explanation than SHC. The Wick Effect has human fat as the source of fuel, and the skin, hair or clothing act as a wick, much like an oil lantern.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No, it doesn't appear possible.

Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.

During June, July, and August; the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the northern hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in December, January, and February. Contrary to what some people believe[who?], the seasons do not result from the varying distance between the Earth and the Sun. Instead the tilt of the Earth causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux.    See diagram to explain    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Season...

There are a few reasons for this:    1. there is usually a simplify part first that requires use of some TRIG identities.  2. there is the use of RADIANS rather than degrees, for which some students are not at ease with.  3. there is the repetitive aspect of TRIG functions that students find bewildering.    All in all, a potentially daunting topic. To be honest though, there is nothing that you need fear here, so long as you take it methodically and slowly. Also, you have to understand what it is you are doing.    Solving the TRIG Equation  Of the 3 topics listed above, I am concentrating on part 3, here in this Lesson. I may well write a Lesson on RADIAN measure at a later date.    First thing, when solving a TRIG equation, is to understand or accept that each of SINE, COSINE and TANGENT have 2 angles that will satisfy the given equation within any 360 degree range. This applies only when we have things like sin(x) or tan(x) + 2 for example.    If we have multiples, such as cos(2x), then we also multiply up the possible number of solutions. In "general", as a rule of thumb, expect the following, within any 360 degree range:    sin(x) --> 2 solutions  sin(2x) --> 4 solutions  sin(3x) --> 6 solutions  sin(4x) --> 8 solutions  sin(5x) --> 10 solutions etc    I shall concentrate here on simple equations, using just (x)... so 2 answers are expected.    Basics  This is difficult to explain, with no real picture to use, so bear with me.    Imagine a set of axes with the 4 quadrants being (in an anti-clockwise manner) 1 to 4 starting with the top right one.  Imagine a line from the origin and lieing on the positive x-axis. This is defined as zero. Now imagine the line turning anticlockwise. When it reaches the positive y-axis, the angle is 90 degrees.    The line carries on rotating, to rest on the negative x-axis... the angle is now 180 degrees.  The line then carries on again, to rest against the negative y-axis... the angle is now 270 degrees    Finally the line completes one revolution and reaches the positive x-direction again. This is 360 degrees (equivalent to 0 degrees).    So, thinking about an angle of say 15 degrees, this is identical in TRIG terms to one of 360+15 --> 375 degrees. Etc.    QUADRANT PROPERTIES  Looking at a set of axes:    Quadrant 1 is the top right one.  Quadrant 2 is the top left one.  Quadrant 3 is the bottom left one.  Quadrant 4 is the bottom right one.    In Quadrant 1 SIN, TAN, COS are ALL +ve  In Quadrant 2 SIN is +ve  In Quadrant 3 TAN is +ve  In Quadrant 4 COS is +ve    eg sin30 = 1/2 and sin150 = 1/2  but sin210 = -1/2 and sin330 = -1/2  what about cos240? well, this angle is in the third quadrant, where cos is negative, so whatever the numerical value, it will be negative, at least! Put it in your calculator...answer is -1/2.    The issues come when you are asked something like "Solve sinx = 1/2 for 0     If you put this into your calculator, you will get 30 degrees as the answer but what about the 150 degree answer too? How do we find that? That is what i am building up to.    Look at the following lines:    graph(200, 200, -6, 6, 3, -3, x/2, -x/2 )    This is the crux of this Lesson... think about the angle each line makes with the x-axis. So in the second quadrant, we have the triangle and the angle between the line and the -ve x-axis is 30 degrees. However, I said earlier that in my view of angles here, angles are measure from the zero of the +ve x-direction, so the line in reality makes an angle of 180-30 --> 150. Look on your calculator at sin(150). this is 1/2.    NEGATIVE questions  If the question asked "Solve sinx=-1/2", then by my method, we would do the following:    1. work out the Quadrant 1 angle, ie solve sinx=1/2 --> this gives 30 degrees.  2. Now, for sin to be negative, we need the quadrant 3 and quadrant 4 angles.    So, these are 180+30 and 360-30. In other words 210 and 330. Find the sin of both of these..you get -1/2.    Done!  That is all there is.    EXAMPLES  Q: Solve tanA = 0.4877 for 0   A: The solution is as follows:    1. Find the quadrant1 solution using your calculator, as A = sin^(-1)(0.4877) --> A = 26 degrees, to 2 significant figures).    2. What about the "other" angle that will satisfy this equation? Well, for tan to be positive, the angle must be in Quadrant3. Visualising the third quadrant, with the triangle with an angle of 26 degrees there, this is really an angle of 180+26 --> 206 degrees.    3. check... tan206 is 0.4877    Q: Solve cosA = -0.5592 for 0   A: The solution is as follows:    1. Find the quadrant1 solution (the POSITIVE VERSION) using your calculator. In other words find angle A = cos^(-1)(0.5592) --> A = 56 degrees.    2. The question wants the angle to give a negative answer, so for COS, this means the angle has to be in Quadrant2 and Quadrant3.

Ym1KivCuaa	The equation for Boiling point elevation is:    ?T = Kb * mb    mb can be defined as mass * the number of ions the solute breaks into.    Since CaCl2 will break into Ca and 2 Cl, it breaks into 3 ions.    Therefore, the equation is 0.52 * (5 * 3), which equals 7.8.    Now add the 7.8 to the original boiling point (100) to get the new boiling point. 100 + 7.8 = 107.8 degrees Celsius, which is the new boiling point.|`|tvUPseuwaa	ITs CrazY KooKy BlAHA

cRDbeUDvaa	Start with the integrated rate equation for a second-order reaction.  We'll call the reactant A so that [A] is the concentration of A at some time = t, and [A]0 is the initial concentration of A (0.060 M).  The second-order integrated rate equation should be in your book:    1/[A] - 1/[A]0 = kt    You know that 50% of A has reacted, so [A] = 0.5[A]0.  Substitute in for this and for t and for the value of [A]0 = 0.060 M    1/{0.5(0.060 M)} - 1/(0.060 M) = k (143 s)    16.67 M^-1 = k (143 s)    k = (16.67 M^-1)/(143 s) = 0.117 M^-1 s^-1    If you have other problems that are second order, this will work.  You will need a different integrated rate equation if the reaction is first order or zero order.  Look up those equation in your book.  Note that the answer above mine is wrong because it uses the integrated rate equation for a first order reaction, not a second order reaction.|`|JDl0z6TGaa	ln[At]=-KT+ln[A0]  -ln[At/A0]/T=K    At=.5*.06  A0=.06  T=143    -ln[.03/.06]/143=K  -ln[8.333]/143=K    K=4.85E-3    rate coefficient has units of mol^1-n L^n-1 s^-1  n=order    K=4.85E-3 L/[mol*sec]    Hope this helps

If you your reasoning to prove their is a creator, then the same logic can be used by placing the God of your choice in place of "atheism" in your question and it still fits together just as nicely.

All events, by definition, occured with 100% probability.  Now, quantum mechanics limits events to only part of reality, since much of qm (and therfore much of reality) is probability based, much of reality is by definition not about events.  You go right ahead and eliminate metaphysics (whatever that is) and probability from your "reality".  good luck with that.  Might have trouble explaining things such as chemistry, physics, matter and energy but those are minor objections to your amazing insight. take your meds.  By the way look up the term "solopism".

Science, I was taught and believe is not about finding Truth it is about a process of eliminating the false and (hopefully) getting closer to undrstanding the truth.  It is a work in progress and never complete, it never claims to have "the" truth.  Scientists believe in "truths" - everybody has a philosophy - at least those of us with a coherent consciousness - but I digress.  Scientists are people and even if the institution of Science does not claim to have any truths, even if the practitioners think THEY have truths, it has been the most reliable way to enduring knowledge that we have ever used.

CAUSE 3/4 = 75%  SO I TAKE 2,2,&1 ----> from 1,1,2,2,  so you would get a 5/6  score, meaning the 2 points is FREE since its IMPOSSIBLE to get full score with 3 questions, so you get a 7/8 (87.5%)    that ??/80 is maybe just a number... i personally think 60 is the best score you can get assuming you get 2 on every question... so 60 would be an A.... thats the most logical explanation i can think of...    so you got a   2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (THIS IS just an example using the 55 score you were talking about, these numbers are just made up)    the top 75 % would be   2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1  meaning it would add up to 55/80 or 55/60 since its impossible to get an 80 if it was a 75% counted score  BUT  im assuming 20 points is FREE  so it would be 75/80 you pulled off  since it would ONLY COUNT the top 30    ======================================...    if it was confusing  , then sorry  BUT  it simply counts 30 questions to GRADE  and you get 10 questions FREE  since alot of tests do that... they are lenient with the education system nowadays, using multiple choice and the point system... just like the SATs    i say this theory is correct, cause its the only FAIR possible grading system logical enough to even exist    40 questions x 2 ( maximum score ) = 80  counting 75% of 80 = 60   or 30 questions so 60points ( 30 questions )    so 60/80 ---> 80/80 (100%)  and 20/80 ---> 40/80 (50%)  and 0/80 -----> 20/80 (25%)  25% or 20/80 is the MINIMUM possible score you can get      ====================================  SO YOUR ANSWER IS  WHAT EVER YOUR SCORE YOU GOT +20  so SCORE + 20 POINTS = YOUR GRADE  ======================================...

1AZLDNZLaa	Engineering in any discipline will require solid math skills.  All undergraduate Engineering students regardless of discipline usually have a set of common core courses which will include Calculus I, II, & III as well as Linear Algebra & Differential Equations at a minimum.    It is a myth that Industrial Engineering is light on math. Industrial Engineering involves a lot of probability and statistics (calculus-based) as well as mathematical programming, and linear and non-linear optimization. In addition since IE is involved quite a bit with process improvement there are plenty of cross-over courses into other disciplines like Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Engineering that require strong calculus skills.    Despite IEs sometimes being called "Imaginary" Engineers it is also a myth that IEs don't earn as well as engineers in other disciplines. Being involved with process improvements, supply-chain management and optimization, the efforts of an IE can save companies millions a year, and the IEs doing so can be compensated very well.     Many of my colleagues throughout my career have been EEs, MechEs, ChemEs, yet those of us involved with the mathematical modeling and mathematical programminng all had advanced IE degrees. "Imagine" that.    You will need to work hard to improve you math skills (and it can be done) if you want to go into engineering as a career, but don't count on anyone cutting you some slack.|`|6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	You have to get the degree first, which means at least two semesters of calculus (probably 3), and a host of classes that build on that foundation.|`|1Izur5YXaa	not that much|`|xdiwDak3aa	Engineering has a lot of math.|`|8f1645b57626d40f1d90691f3e9c2772aa	If memory serves, IE was for engineers that didn't want to do calculus.

omGIB04Uaa	"Mol equiv" has to do with the relative amounts of starting compounds in a reaction, based on their numbers of moles.    "Add 1.5 mol equiv. of acetic acid" means you need to use 1.5 times the amount of acetic acid with respect to the other starting material, based on the number of moles.      For example, let's suppose you are starting with 2 mol of compound A. If the procedures say you need to add 1.5 "mol equiv." of acetic acid, that means you need to add 2 x 1.5 = 3 mol of acetic acid.
xpyQZba7aa	You produced 0.461 moles of H2O. So you only used enough octane to produce this much H2O    The equation tells you that  18 moles H2O forms from 2 moles octane  So 1 mole H2O will form from 2/18 moles of octane    Therefore 0.461 moles H2O forms from (2/18 x 0.461) moles octane  = 0.0512 moles of octane    So 0.0512 moles of octane must have reacted to give 0.461 moles H2O    You started with 0.360 mol octane.  Left over octane = start octane - used octane  = 0.360 mol - 0.0512 mol  = 0.309 moles octane left over

memleYtRaa	The Galactic Plane is the densest part of the Galaxy, our solar system periodically crosses this area and will soon again cross over it. However, there is no "Date" for crossing it, people who already believe the Myan theory use the fact that we should be crossing the Galactic Plane soon as evidence that it will happen in 2012.    The crossing of the Galactic Plane happens about every 30 million years, and coincides with periodic extinction events on the earth. One theory claims that due to the density of the crossing many comets strike Earth during this period.    However, this is not some sudden event and actually happens over a period of THOUSANDS of years, in which comets periodically strike Earth.    This is simply a respected theory being dragged into hype, it has no potential for the OMG end of the world in 2012 scenario.    Keep in mind that in recent years scientist around the world have drastically improved Asteroid Detection systems, nothing is going to slip in without us noticing, and the solar system has passed through this Galactic Plane over a hundred times and all life hasn't ended.    If most species could survive it without any technology, we can definitely do it.    The Myan calander does not END in 2012 it RESTARTS in 2012, the same as it restarted when Cortez arrived.    Also keep in mind the Myans thought their white skinned snake god would come back with his dreaded tall animal mounts, NOT Cortez.|`|pHcb7atgaa	i have asked a similar question. you worded it better than i did lol but id like to know the same thing so if any way could you let me know of info you get about this? ill try to watch this question or whatever to keep up. thanks|`|E0U2yII3aa	See  for youself:    http://www.universetoday.com/category/20...|`|sCD1YaAmaa	Even though I don't know much about it and I wont probably even answer your question, there is a lot of people who trust science and technology to stop massive natural power!

But it's bad to use anything & everything you can come with to try and try say it's so.
g5M5Ivhgaa	I did a lab similar to this before and I hope this helps    In my lab, we had the substance hooked up to a flask of water so that when the substance entered the flask, it pushed water out into a beaker.  Then we took a barometer (measures atmospheric pressure) reading and used P(total) = P(A) + P(B) +...      The total pressure is equal to the sum of the partial pressures.  Water has a certain pressure at certain tempuratures.      Once you subtract the water vapor pressure from the atmospheric pressure, the pressure will be known

JovL9W12aa	We'll need the molar mass of quartz first:    Si: 28.09 g/mol  O: 16.00 g/mol  SiO2 = (28.09) + 2(16.00) = 60.09 g/mol    Now we need to find out how many quart molecules we have. Find how many mols there are first:    1.10g quartz / 60.09 g/mol = .0183 mols of quartz  .0183 mols quartz * 6.022*10^23 molecules/mol =   1.102*10^22 molecules of quartz    There are 2 atoms of Oxygen for every molecule of quartz.

yrEuZXSOaa	When mass is lost, it is balanced by the increase in energy.  When energy is lost, it is balanced by the increase in mass.  A small amount of mass, however, can be turned into a tremendous amount of energy. E=mc^2 (thanks to Mr. Einstein)  This can be seen in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Where the mass in the bombs were transformed into heat, radiation, light, and sound energy.|`|EDjKCt0baa	This means that mass and energy must not be created or destroyed in your reaction. It also means that when you convert from mass to energy, it must balance out to conserve both. Given by the equation   E = mc^2    Energy = (mass)(speed of light)^2    For example, this most frequently comes into play in nuclear reactions (fission and fusion).  If you weighed a uranium atom and then you weighed the parts together after it was split, you would come up with the split uranium atom to weigh less. This seems to defy logic. Doesn't the sum of the weight of the parts equal the weight of the whole? It turns out that when you split it, some of the uranium atom's mass is converted directly into energy. You can find the amount of energy produced using the above formula. And vice versa.    I hope this was somewhat helpful.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	if you are talking about btu(brittish thermal units)it is the amount of heat generated by burnins something,such as woor compared to the same mass as coal or fuel oil,if its nuclear its the yield of electrons in a chain reaction u239 and strodium the mass of each being the same strodium will yield around 10 times more electron units of energy.plus other types of energy.but the energy release it 10 times more,if you meen food then a same weight of watermelion will not provide as many calories as the same mass of meat,also the amount of avalible energy of any mass of anything converted to energy has a ratio.mass times energy

F211fxNFaa	The trick will be to have ailerons. The aileron on one wing will be bent up and the other will be bent down. The more you bend them, the tighter the circle will be. But a turning airplane tends to slip a lot, causing it to fall faster than it otherwise would, so it will be necessary to bend up the elevator on the horizontal stabilizer (at the tail).    It would be easier to mount the entire horizontal stabilizer so that the back of it is higher than the front and to make the wings so that they are slightly warped.    I know this is not easy to understand unless you already know a little about aeronautics, but I do not know how to explain it any better without a picture. I hope this helps anyway.

ldl8y9i2aa	The plane of the ecliptic IS the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun.  The earth is the only planet that is ALWAYS at 0 degrees to the ecliptic plane.    Every other planet crosses the plane of the ecliptic twice each time they orbit around the sun once.  So each planet can also be at 0 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic, although momentary, and far and few between.    As mentioned the only planet with inhabitants is earth.|`|Ww4Va6sqaa	Well, the Earth is the only planet anywhere near the ecliptic that has inhabitants.

Now the probability of a person at random, given the test is positive, actuall has heart disease is ...    The percentage with heart disease and a positive test / the percentage with a positive test. This is equal to .0768/(.0768 + .0644) =0.5439    So if the dr tells you the test came back positive for heart disease, there's almost a fifty percent chance that you don't have heart disease.

AA12336056	Okay. First thing you do is make a chart.  in the X direction:  Vo = 3.2 m/s  Vf  a = 0 m/s2  s  t = 2.3 s  and in the y direction  Vo = 0  Vf  a = 9.8 m/s2  s  t = 2.3 s    You are trying to find the displacement (s) for both x and y. Let's start with y.    a)  Use the formula s = VoT + (1/2)a(t^2)  So you get s = (0)(2.3) + (1/2)(9.8)(2.3^2)  Leaving you with s = 25.92 m    And now x    b)  Use the same formula s = Vot + (1/2)a(t^2)  So you get s = (3.2)(2.3) + (1/2)(0)(3.2^2)  Leaving you with s = 7.36 m|`|VxhdpARWaa	you must look within yourself to find the answer you seek.

E0U2yII3aa	A star above 100 solar masses usually don't turn red. It will stay as a blue supergiant, spending roughly less than 2 million years before exploding as a bright hypernova.    Stars from 40x to 60x that of the mass of the sun spends a little over 5 million years before turning into red hypergiants.    Stars around 10x to 25x the mass of the sun usually spend 10 million years before turning into red supergiants and dying in a supernova.    Stars below 10x the mass of the sun don't turn red supergiants, just red giants. Usually a star 8-10 solar masses will spend 20 million years at main sequence before turning into a red giant to die as a massive white dwarf.    Stars around 6-8x the mass of the sun will spend 30-40 million years as dwarfs and die a massive white dwarf as well. Sirius B is a good example.    Stars 3-6 solar masses spend dwarfhood from 40-200 million years. The lower the mass, the longer will it stay at main sequence before turning into a red giant.    Stars around 2-3 solar masses spend 200million to 2 billion years of dwarfhood before turning into red giants.    Stars around 1.5x the mass of the sun spend around 3-4 billion years as a dwarf before turning into a red giant.    Stars like the sun spend 10 billion years at main sequence before turning into a red giant, 200 times as large and a thousand times as luminous.    Stars can only turn into a red giant provided it is above 0.8x the mass of the sun. Anywhere lower than this, stars will spend their eternity as dwarfs fusing elements very efficiently into heavier elements before dying and cooling as black dwarfs. Anyway there are red dwarfs. They are stars less than 40% the mass of the sun. They are red when they were born and will spend a very, very long time having that color.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	It all depends on the mass of the star and what you mean by "turns red".    A star like our sun will expand to a red giant once it exhausts its hydrogen fuel (when it is about 9 billion years old).  It will be a red giant for about a billion years before shrinking to a white dwarf stage.    A star more massive than our sun could become a red giant much earlier in its life (less than a billion years old) and remain as a red giant for only 100,000 years before likely exploding as a supernova.|`|5OYlafG2aa	Depends how massive the star is.    Do a search for 'stellar evolution', it probably can yield much better results.

D5QgyGbXaa	There was a perceived "missle gap" in the 1950s that was not true.  When the USSR orbited the first satellite, the first animal in earth orbit, and the first human in orbit, the US government felt that it must spend time and money on space to keep up or pass USSR.  The missles were built for military, but adapted to science and manned missions for public approval of expenditures.  The situation has changed somewhat.  There is no "Cold War" now, as countries mentioned are not isolated from one another, and depend upon trade ties for economic successes.  But that could change as long as there are differences in political philosophies and national goals for the future and for space colonization.  The spinoffs from research for space effort has changed daily life.  Integrated circuits and minaturization, new materials and uses, communication satellites, and grants and scholarships to universities and companies have stimulated research in many fields.|`|32ae3644d1b4faf4df296639803a0433aa	start with luna -ussr and surveyor usa|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	You may have to find some archive website - articles that were written at the time (the 1960's) were in print only, not electronic.

DhLIo8nbaa	Even thought they are expired it will decrease the potency but they will still work, so if she takes too many of them she could overdose because you can overdose on vicodan.  It all depends on her tolerance and height and weight, and the milligram of the pill.  If they are a high milligram and she takes like 20 of them then there is a good chance she could overdose.  You need to rtalk to someone because if she really wants to commit suicide then she will do it any way possible, usually pills are the way of choice because its the least painful.  You need to talk to her mother, or even a guidence counselor at school or someone like that because she obviously needs help.  The thing is I used to counsel in mental health, and I have found that usually when people tell a friend or family member they want to commit suicide it is because they want help, and they are crying out for it because she would not have told you about it if she did nnot want some kind of help.  You really need to make sure you talk to someone about it, maybe mention it to your mother that you are scared about it and she can point you in the right direction.  I dont even know how old you are im just assuming your in highschool.

qqoHyFakaa	it actually has a lot to do with biology.    our eyes contain rods and cones.  rods are sensitive to light while cones are sensitive to colors.  human eyes don't have a lot of rods whereas many nocturnal animals, such as raccoons, have lots of densely packed rods and are able to see well with very little light.    our eyes, however, do have a higher concentration of rods at the peripheries. astronomers often use something called averted vision to see dim objects through telescopes.  this is done by directly looking at an area of sky next to the object that the astronomer really wants to examine, allowing the higher concentration of rods to really pick up the light from the object and hence, allowing them to see more detail.|`|jSPj3S6faa	We can't see at night because we are asleep.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Not sure what you mean "why can't we see at night" - I can see at night, lots of people can (there are cars on the roads all night).    We see because light enters our eyes.  That light could be light emitted by an object (such as the sun, stars, or a light bulb) or light that is reflected from an object (such as the moon, planets, and almost everything else).    At night, when there is no sunlight, only the rods in our eyes are in use.  The rods can detect low light levels, so we can see at night but we don't see in colour and we can't discern fine details.|`|uv6eCTibaa	The human eye uses light to see. Light bounces off our surroundings and into our eye through our pupil, the black hole at the center. A picture forms on our retina, the lining at the back of the eye.

BDKqYOSraa	My friends above are well meaning in their suggestion and I intend no disrespect, but ... very, very few practicing physicians can/want to have a teenager follow them around as they examine patients.    I am a physician, a medical school instructor and a med school admissions committee member. I live this every day.  I'm telling you, it almost never happens. Med students: yes. High school students: no.    All physicians are bound by privacy laws that require patient permission before anyone has access to their private medical information, let alone a stranger standing in the room listening as they discuss that sore on their genitalia...  'let alone the fact that the spectator in the room is a 17 year old kid without any medical training whatsoever.    Maybe this was done 10-15 years ago, but today most malpractice insurance agents would have a seizure at the thought.    Instead, volunteer at a hospital. This is a great way to get a feel for a medical environment, meet lots of doctors and pad your college application with a nice activity.    Then, approach one of your new MD friends for an "informational interview". Prepare a full list of questions about medicine and "the life". Physicians will be much more amenable to this then you watching them perform appendectomies or pap smears.|`|AA10579309	I second the vote for shadowing -- it is really the best way to learn what a doctor does.

The dimensions provided for tubing on the other hand refer to the actual outside diameter.  *For example: The actual outside diameter of 1?" pipe is 1.625"  while 1?" tube has a true 1.25" outside diameter.  *The best thing to do is measure your material on the outside diameter and size your tools from there.    *A tube is formed continuously (such as an extrusion), whereas a pipe is rolled from sheet material and seamed along its length.  Tubes can have an end on them (test tubes) rounded at one end. Pipes are always open on both ends.  *Pipe can be defined by Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) under American standards classifications.  Nominal Bore (NB) may be specified under British standards classifications along with a schedule (wall thickness).  Looser tolerances compared with tubes.

OXw0rv4Saa	As long as you keep the skin clean, the brain is a really clean place to be.    The intestines, however, harbor an As-yet-undiscovered variety and quantity (some estimates put feces at close to 30% bacteria) of bacterial species.  True, most of these are "good" bacteria that help us digest our food.  That doesn't mean they can't be pathogenic if they get into the wrong places.  Even a few specks of fecal matter left in the abdomen after surgery can cause massive infection that spreads to the blood-called sepsis, which is deadly in hours and almost impossible to cure without advanced cardiac monitoring, fluid support, and special blood-pressure-supporting drugs (like epinephrine).  All of those are recent medical innovations.    Many of these bacteria are resistant to the earliest antibiotics (like penicillin) discovered.    It's true that an abdominal wound won't kill you quickly- there aren't many major blood vessels to hit, and the belly doesn't contain any of the organs that support immediate life.    Your kidneys, liver, and intestines are very important, it's true, but aren't important to your survival over the next, say, 24-48 hours.    Other wounds will kill you faster, but abdominal wounds were and are much harder to keep clean.|`|15dc330dd70f88a8cc71d777d9410557aa	Those Roman "brain surgeries" usually resulted in death within days. infection and lack of sterilization procedures kept it from being effective until relatively recently.
pKOkarYhaa	Simple answer - It's what I refer to as the Shoes and Socks Theorem.    You can think of f as putting on your socks, and g as putting on your shoes. Then f^-1 is taking off your socks and g^-1 is taking off your shoes.    Now, you generally put on your socks before you put on your shoes, BUT, take off your socks *after* you take off your shoes.    Complex answer -     You will find this kind of behavior in any Group - any structure where you have an identity element (something like 0 does for addition and 1 does for multiplication), the associative property (a+b)+c = a+(b+c), and inverse elements a+(-a)=0 and (-a)+a=0.    Notice that I didn't list the commutative property, a+b=b+a. That isn't required in groups. So if we look at a group, you can see that (f*g)*(g^-1*f^-1)  = f*g*g^-1*f^-1  = f*1*f^-1  = f*f^-1  = 1

NQfwFTUdaa	Of course! E-mail it to me! [Just kidding]    Ideas do get stolen. I think if you read the history of science, you get the feeling some undergrad students had ideas that evil professors stole.    But this is more uncommon in modern times. For example, grad students often submit a research proposal, this goes usually goes to a committee, and a faculty member is chosen to guide you through it. When this research is published, it will either be the professors name first followed by the student, but sometimes if it really was all your idea the professor will put his name second [followed by other people who assisted]. Research is occasionally published alphabetically if everyone contributed equally, but usually the people who contributed most to the project get their names first.    However, just being an undergrad or grad student and having your name attached to an important project will propel your career forward. You would get a great grad school position, great fellowship opportunities, you're choice of career positions, etc.    When you submit your idea to the research committee, it is in writing, and many people see it. It is proof that it was your idea initially. If you are extra worried you can get a patent, or write it all down and have it notarized by a notary public (hell maybe twice if it is that important). I have also heard of someone that sent an idea to himself in certified mail with the description written as "Idea for enzyme inactivation... [blah blah]" on the actual mail declaration form. I don't know how legally binding this is, but it's cheap and you can do that along with the above idea for a notary public certifying your idea...     I've had a great academic career, top tier universities, with decent (OK) grades, and got admitted into med school. But I've never published and it is something I really, really want to do. Having a great idea is great, but honestly rare (all the easy stuff has been done). More often it is being in the right research project at the right time and knowing the right people. I did YEARS of research and never got published. A friend of mine went to a research project and ONE MONTH later the project was published, with her name attached!!!

Well it is like you have used PE also, Look:    PE = Mgh ...................KE =1/2mVf^2 - 1/2mVi^2  PE = KE..  PE =1/2mVf^2 - 1/2mVfi^2..........  ......=1/2mVf^2 -0  So it follows  mgh = 1/2mVf^2    ...gh =1/2Vf^2..2gh=Vf^2  are they similar?  So, will Vf be the same?|`|AA12336056	This is a pretty straightforward energy problem. You just have to remember that energy is conserved in pretty much every problem you will be given.    Before the rock is dropped, it only have Potential Energy. This can be expressed as PE = mgh.    Half way down, the rock has equal parts Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy. That means that the total energy E = mg(.5h) + (1/2)m(v^2). This is equal to the PE we found in the previous step.    In the instant before the rock hits the ground, it only has KE. So this can be defined as E = (1/2)m(v^2)    Remember the conservation of energy? That means we can set the PE from the first step equal to the KE in the last. This gives us:  mgh = (1/2)m(v^2)    Notice that there is m on both sides. Those will cancel to give us: gh = (1/2)(v^2)    Multiply both sides by 2 and take the square root, and you get v = root(2gh)    Plug in the values you listed and you get v = 5.42 m/s.

Kil7sZUSaa	The speed of sound is 0.34 km/s, and the distance (in km) is speed (in km/s) multiplied by time (in seconds).    d = 0.34 x t    When we divide the time by 3, this is just the same as multiplying by 0.33, which is very close to 0.34, that is why this is a good approximation.    The speed of sound is 0.211 mi/s, close to 1/5, so a good estimate is to divide the time in seconds by 5 to get the distance in miles.|`|AxlFcjZoaa	the speed of lightning is 3*10^5km/sec & speed od of sound  is just 332mt/sec .it is negligible  in  comparison to speed of light . therefore to get  the feel of distance  just count  the seconds till sound (thunder) is heard  after flash.  use the  simple formula  distance=speed*time i.e dist(km)=3*10^5*time(seconds)   1 mile=1.61 km

Meridians are lines of longitude (vertical lines on the map). Because the come to a point at the poles they cannot be parallel.    The date line is a point where the time zones force the date to change.  Time zones are a result of the earth's rotation where the poles are [seen as] not moving. Only one "slice" gets sun at a time. The time is an indicator of how much sun that place is getting.    Therefore the date line must be a meridian.

96145621c75947c84171b675f275b9cbaa	mRNAs (messenger RNAs) are a kind of RNA transcript. Examples of other kinds are ribosomal RNAs (which make up the catalytic parts of the ribosomes) and transfer RNAs (which link codons to corresponding amino acids). All of these types of RNAs are transcripts produced from a DNA template    RNA transcript is the copy of RNA from DNA (occurs in the nucleus in eukaryotes). RNA transcript goes through modifications within the nucleus before it is released into the cell as mRNA. Since there is no nucleus in prokaryotes, they just use RNA transcript.
MJBpR9byaa	No need for confusion: You have probably already proved that the diagonals of a rectangle are equal. In case you havent already done so, lets prove it here:    Draw rectangle ABCD.   We already know that AB = CD and BC = AD.  We also know that angle BAD = angle ABC = 90.    Now, draw the diagonals, AC and BD.  We will show, first, that triangle BAD and triangle ABC   are congruent, by s. a. s.:   side AB = side AB, by identity;  angle BAD = angle ABC, shown above; and  side AD = side BC, also shown above.  Because the two triangles are congruent, all their corresponding parts must be equal. Therefore, the two diagonals, BD and AC are shown to be equal.     Now, we have established that the two diagonals of a rectangle must be equal.     But this is the very same thing as saying that, if the two diagonals of a quadrilateral are unequal, then it can not be a rectangle, which is what we set out to prove.    I hope that you find help in this answer.

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	Cooling alone is not enough for the formation of clouds.Sufficient moisture in the air is also necessary.That is why there is no cloud formation over the deserts.Even though the temperature comes down to very low level in the deserts during night(when compared to other places),no cloud forms as the moisture is scarce.  Even if sufficient moisture is available in a place,the cooling should cause condensation;in other words the temperature should decrease and become equal to the dew point temperature.These conditions are sometimes met over the ground during night or early morning resulting in the formation of fog which is nothing but cloud on the ground.|`|9Wi2eNInaa	It depends on the relative humidity of the air plus it's density.    Clouds form when the air is laden with an amount of moisture and as the temperature drops the moisture condenses as little droplets because the cold air can't support it. But close to the surface of the earth, the ground cools less quick than the air so it gives up it's heat and the heat rises and carries off thosw droplets of moisture usually before you see them.     By the morning the ground now is usually colder than the air and the moisture remaining in the air condenses on colder surfaces to make dew.    A lot of the moisture in the air also climbs to cloud level where the low pressure allows the moisture to condense and remain liquid at temperatures below freezing.     There are to many air currents and condensing surfaces on the ground level for moisture to stay close to the ground for long enough to make a cloud

As for crustaceans, most of them don't even exhibit internal fertilization (i.e. the male and female release egg and sperm into the water together outside their bodies.)      There are some species of octopus in which the female keeps her clutch of fertilized eggs attached to her arms. She does not leave her den to hunt or feed while brooding, she stays and makes sure the clutch receives the proper water flow and temperature conditions. By the time the eggs hatch she is so weak that she cannot go hunt even when released from mothering duty. The newly hatched octopi then eat her as their first meal.     Many animals die after reproducing from the energy expenditure of mating, but this is usually right after egg deposition.

I'm going to assume you're asking a question about crustaceans, not fish, which are two very different things. (Incidentally, I can't think of any exploding fish either).     Crustaceans can't really be said to 'get pregnant'. Typically, they disperse eggs, sperm or fertilized eggs freely into the ocean. There are, however, a few groups of aquatic crustaceans I recall incubating eggs, and I think you might have better luck searching within these orders:    Decapoda - More specifically Pleocyemata since that's what Pleocyemata refers to--the female keeps the eggs in her pleopods.     Isopoda - These include the terrestrial 'wood lice', which keeps their eggs under the abdomen until the small pink offspring hatch, giving the impression of giving birth, and of course marine isopods such as the giant isopod and the sea slater.      I did, also, find a poem by Durienda, "Neptune Can't Save You Either", which mentions this sea animal but sadly does not name it. Also, the book "Her Mother's Daughter" by Marilyn French describes the life of a female midge, whose offspring somehow eat her from the inside out(a midge is closely related to a mosquito). I have no idea if that's true.

E0U2yII3aa	Stars rotate on its own axis. The sun rotates on its axis every 30 days on average. Sirius on the other hand rotates on its axis at a moderately slow speed of 16km/sec. With a radius of roughly 1.75x that of the sun, it makes a complete rotation in under 5.5 days. Stars revolve around a common center of gravity IF they happen to be in a multiple star system. Sirius is a member of a binary with a massive white dwarf, which I think you know is Sirius B. They revolve a common center of gravity of 20AU on average (8AU at perigee and 31.5AU at apogee) at around 50.1 years. Anyway, all stars in a galaxy still have their galactic orbits that takes hundreds of millions of years.

I will assume you are asking from the perspective of an observer on earth.    It is not the stars that 'rotate', it is the earth but they appear to rotate.    If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, the north star (Polaris) will be located near true North at an angle up from the Horizon equal to your Latitude.  Near the North Star (very near) there is an imaginary point called the "North Celestial Pole" that all stars appear to SPIN around.  Those stars further away from this point will 'spin' faster and those closer will seem to spin around the point slower.|`|2b3eeb86bc8d64e12f3c71ade9c771eeaa	A star is a sun.

Then for Balsams say 30(x+2)+20 ... so you have 1400=x+20+30(x+2)+20  Then simplify that.  I think|`|AA12196812	OK, let's call   of hemlock X  Twice as many sprice, then, is 2*X  Balsams =20+3*X    so X+2*X+20+3*X=1400  simplify that and it's easy!|`|0fMGbp8Qaa	Ok so the only one not multiplied by something was hemlock.  You have 2x spruce as hemlock, so spruce+hemlock= 3x (x is hemlock)    balsams are 3x+20    so when you *** 3x+20 and 3x you get 6x+20=1400    so 6x=1380  x=230|`|7qpQSk0Paa	S + H + B = 1400  S = 2H  B = 3H + 20    2H +H + 3H + 20 = 1400  6 H = 1380  H = 230  S = 460  B = 710|`|JMjZwvPKaa	hemlock + spruce + balsams = 1400    hemlock = x  spruce = 2x  balsams = 3x + 20    x + 2x + 3x + 20 = 1400    6x = 1380    x = 230|`|HMUEO3NTaa	Hemlocks=230  Spuces=460  Balsams=710    h(2)=s  20+h(3)=b    s+h+b=1400  h(2)+h+(20+h(3))=1400  h(6)+20=1400  h(6)=1380  230=h    h(2)=s  460=s    20+h(3)=b  710=b    BOOM!|`|wK5k435Waa	Look in the back of the book, youll find the ansere there.|`|25YN8Aohaa	use the website cramster.com it helps with aLL ur math homework|`|8PtMvfzBaa	Here is your set of equations.    spruce=2 * hemlock  balsams=20 + 3*hemlock  spruce+hemlock+balsams=1400    What you need to do is to solve the systems of equations.  The easiest and most efficient way in my opinion is to use matrices. The source will give more information about how to do this.    Ax=B    S=2H  B=20 + 3H  S+H+B=1400    Solve the equations so all the constants are on the right and all the variables are on the right. Also make the order of the variables the same in each equation.  If a variable does not exist in an equation write it with a coeffcient of 0.    2H  -S+0B= 0  3H+0S -B= -20   H  +S +B= 1400    Now turn this into the matrices A, x, and B. This is basically done by taking the coefficients of the variables for A the variables for x and the constants for B.    A= [2 -1 0        3  0 -1        1  1  1]    x=  [H   S   B]    B=[0       -20       1400]    Now you need to find the inverse of A which I really don't feel like getting into.  You can use any graphing calculator or the MINVERSE() function in excel. Then multiply the inverse of A times B.  The resulting matrix will be the number of hemlocks, spruces, and balsams in that order(the same order as your matrix x).    Hope that helps. :)|`|dnXT1c8maa	solution:    Let x denote the total number of hemlock planted.  Then, from the given condition              the total number of spruce planted = 2x                   and   the total number of balsams planted = 20 + 3x  Given: total number of seedling trees planted = 1400  Therefore,                    x + 2x + (20 + 3x) = 1400                => 6x  = 1380                => x = 1380 / 6                => x  = 230  Hence,  the total number of hemlock planted = 230 ,               the total number of spruce planted = 2*(230)                                                                           =460                  and   the total number of balsams planted = 20 + (3*230)                                                                        = 710

I'm using the Power Rule, which may or may not make sense to you.    f(x) = 0.08(x^1) This is just another way of expressing it.  f'(x) = 1 x (0.08)(x^0) Power rule states that f'(x^y) = y(x^(y-1)).  f'(x) = 0.08    The slope of the tangent line is 0.08 for all points on the function.|`|7qpQSk0Paa	for any x including x = 2 the rate of change of elevation with respect to x is .08 miles per mile
