They should tell you much you will need to pay if you were to pay out your loan.<br>  <br>  If you are staying with the same lender, as it sounds that you may be then it is possible that they will refinance for no additional fee.  Again though ask your lender what establishment fees you will have to pay for your new loan.<br>  <br>  In Australia regulation means you should be provided with all this information.

El Patriot Act obliga a las intituciones financieras a obtener y verificar los numeros de seguro social de sus nuevos usuarios. Asi que para abrir una cuenta con un broker (ya sea online *scottrade, ameritrade, sharebuilder o etrade o uno "en vivo" como Merryl Lynch o Charles Schwab etc) primero necesitas obtener tu numero de seguro social (ya sea haciendote ciudadano o residente legal).<br>  <br>  En cuanto a los impuestos, solo se aplican impuestos en la venta de acciones. El % sobre la utilidad obtenida a consecuencia de dicha transaccion dependera de cuanto tiempo retuviste dicha accion. Cuando se poseen acciones a largo plazo el impuesto es menor. Tambien depende la situacion particular del dueno de la accion, pq se puede ser dueno de la accion como persona fisica o como persona moral. Las personas morales ( corporaciones ) simpre gozaran de una taza preferencial, asi es la miscelanea fiscal en USA.<br>  Los brokers no retienen ningun cobro. El ano pasado yo vendi unas acciones y a final de ano (antes que comienza la epoca de impuestos en USA) mi broker me envio el monto a pagar (el % de impuesto correspondiente a la ganancia por la venta de las acciones que ordene) y al presentar mi declaracion de impuestos del ano correspondiente lo declare como un ingreso extra.<br>  <br>  Espero haber contestado tu pregunta.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|hbPy3CR6aa	PUEDES TAMBIEN CONSIDERAR ABRIR GRATIS UNA CUENTA FOREX;UN FONDO DE INVERSIONES A CORTO PLAZO Y CON UN ALTO RENDIMIENTO DE INTERESES.....<br>  FOREXMACRO investment<br>  Que es ForexMacro? <br>  Forex Macro es un fondo en el que tienes la oportunidad de acceder al Forex Market desde una mínima inversion de 50 dolares y obtener una extraordinaria rentabilidad de un mínimo de 0,60% diario de su inversión o un 18% de rentabilidad mensual mímino y puede llegar hasta un 30% de interes mensual, según el plan de inversión que usted elija. <br>  Para quienes además de conseguir una alta rentabilidad por su dinero, deseen alcanzar grandes ingresos de carácter residual Forex Macro ha dise?ado el más lucrativo Plan de Ganancias por medio del cual usted ganará excelentes comisiones por los depósitos de sus referidos, en 3 niveles.

7a1604768bf7474c9170d8cc6d86d9f2aa	Depends on the job and the union.  Mine are ~ $14/week|`|4f3GfrN6aa	My union fee is only about $3 a week.  As an Aussie, I willingly pay that money, because firstly, I get life insurance through my union, and secondly, I get it all back at tax time.  Union fees are entirely tax deductable in Australia.  I work part time at that job.  If I worked full time, the fees would be about $6 a week, but again, I'd get it all back at tax time.  I don't get paid any more than someone who is not a union member.  The union has negotiated an award that benefits everyone employed in that industry, not just those who are union members.      I would thoroughly recommend anyone joining a union for these reasons.      I don't believe that union fees have any inflationary effect on the economy.  They are a tiny cost I pay (not my employer, as it is deducted from my pay) that allows me to pool my resources with other union members to have cheap life cover and the benefits of union membership.  It is certainly not as big an inflationary effect as people going out and buying huge cars on finance and plasma screen televisions they don't need.|`|C4LT48CFaa	It depends.  I have seen anywhere from $5 to $10 per paycheck, they usually pressure you to join the union at the time you are hired and then take out the dues by payroll deduction.|`|7QwPe8Waaa	I work in the motion picture industry and we are very union intensive.

z3TIcyI6aa	If your starting A levels, you should be entitled to the EMA (Education Maintenance allowance)    http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAnd...    My half sister would have got this as her dad didn't earn enough to cover expensive books and travel to college etc but being a drunk he refused to sign the paperwork and she worked part time on a saturday as a waitress. It can be done without but the EMA was brought in to help kids stay on at school.    Ask your school or college about it, or if you don't want to do that you can google it and get the info. While its great you want to get a part time job or make a bit of money there is also no shame in taking help when you need it.    In terms if what you can do other than that... I would try and sell on ebay (but you'll need an over 18 to help as you can't get a paypal account till 18)    I do Opinion bar surveys but I have only made 10 in a year and you only get paid for a survey that fits the demographic, so if they only want 25 to 30 year olds in the survey you'll only get 30p for taking part up until the point they kick you off lol ie you say your age, or say you don't own a car etc.    There seems to be a lot of people who say do them but it's not a quick cash thing. The sun does one, someone showed me and it's so complicated and you basically end up spending money on products (such as sign up to Lovefilm, car insurance etc) to gain only 2.50 a pop.      What about asking for a few hours for a paper round or working in the local chemist delivering people's meds?    I know there are laws on how much under 16's can work and what hours but if you google that as well to find out.    I would to be honest try to see if you can get the EMA as that seems to help out a lot of people and be the best way forward especially if there isn't much for you do try out work wise where you are and takes the pressure off you trying to earn when studying.  :0)  Hope that helps!|`|ARAYm7BLaa	there is very little money to be made out of internet surveys particularly at your age - go on freecycle and ask for the books that you need...someone may be able to give them to you|`|7a1604768bf7474c9170d8cc6d86d9f2aa	Walk dogs, babysit, shovel snow, run errands for the elderly, rake leaves, mow lawns.

Not paying in full will destroy her credit worthiness.  Anything close to using 30% of the available credit limit each month will reduce her scores.    At 17 you can open a checking account at most major banks.  Ask for student checking account.  You will be assigned a debit/atm card.  That way the second you turn 18, you ask your bank for a visa card - they will give it to you, if you never over drew in your checking.  /|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Your under 18 and it's not your card, it's your mom's so everything you're doing will only help her (don't take that as a suggestion to not pay, you'd be hurting your mom in the long run if you did).     You can't get your own card til you turn 18 because its a legally binding contract between you and the card company, the agreement to pay and minors can't sign contracts.

This is probably better anyway since splitting puts you below the standard deduction.  If his SS number is on the 1098 form this should be no problem.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The rule for itemized deductions is that you can't deduct something you didn't owe or didn't pay.    So if you own the house together and each pays half, then each can only claim half of the interest and tax and if that's less than $5450, tough....
NwkZ5OmCaa	Chill out.    Get the 1040X ready to go, but don't mail it until you are closer to 4/15.

OK, you may be a first time pax payer or just a cofused one, so I shall be nice about this.     You file a 1040-X (amended return) which says to the IRS that you made a pretty big error (well not that big, but whatever...) and you discovered it before they did.  It is better to do the "X" than wait for them to catch your mistake...they will catch it.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	No- you need to file an amended tax return IMMEDIATELY.  This will probably result in delaying your refund or could result in you owing the IRS money if you've already received your refund and the new info results in higher taxes.  You should know who you've worked for during the year and wait until you've gotten a W2 BEFORE filing your taxes.|`|AA10469473	No, now you have to file an amended return on form 1040X, showing ALL of your 2008 return.  That's why you shouldn't file until you have all of your paperwork.|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	So you filed a false tax return! Not a good idea.  Now you must report the income from the W2 you just received on a Form 1040X, you must mail the Form 1040X to IRS, if you are due a refund once you file the 1040X the refund will be mailed to you.  If you owe then you will be charged penalties. Wait to file the Form 1040X until you are sure you have received all the tax information for tax year 2008.    Processing of Form 1040X takes up 12 weeks, IRS processes all original tax returns first, then when able start to process the Form 1040X|`|tw44fqCpaa	You can't do that.  You have to file a 1040X.  But you need to wait for your refund first so that the original return is processed.  Then you fill out the 1040X and it has to be mailed, it can't be efiled.  It's easy to follow - one column has the numbers from the original return, another has the new numbers, the third column has the difference.  It's best to not jump the gun when filing as employers had until 2/2 to postmark W2s this year.  In future years remember that you will receive a W2 for EACH job you held.  And if you work for a company in multiple locations they sometimes have different EINS and you would get multiple W2s for the same job.|`|bAulU9v1aa	No silly.  You have to file 1040X.  Pay attention to how many jobs you have, then you'll know how many W-2's to expect.

RNqRnG86aa	The housing and mortgage meltdown are responsible for the recession.    The Community Reinvestment Act enacted by Congress in 1977 compelled banks to make loans to poor borrowers who often can not repay them.    The Federal Reserve held interests rates way too low for too long which helped create a housing bubble.    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac turbocharged the credit mania because they were able to borrow at rates below prime because they had the implicit backing of the federal government even though they were allegedly private corporations.     Countrywide and others created and bought sub-prime mortgage loans of questionable value.    Wall street securitzed sub-prime loans and pushed them as safe debt instruments when, in fact, they were near worthless.     The credit rating agencies that are supposed rate the fundamental value of these debt securities failed miserably.    Bank and SEC supervision was non-existent over the last several years.    So you can see there is plenty of blame to go around.|`|4sTnvMJhaa	were have you been for the last eight years? The gov. lied to us as long as they could and now the chit has hit the fan.

If you have a friend or family member who does have a bank account with at least the amount of the check in their account they may be able to cash it for you. You will need to go with them and bring your ID and they may also require a social security card for that amount. Good luck!|`|7a1604768bf7474c9170d8cc6d86d9f2aa	Open a bank account with it.

If you are getting a check you probably won't already be getting it in just two weeks.  Checks take forever, like 4-6 weeks to get, your move may also delay the check, as then the check will be forwarded.  Consider opening a bank account with it.  That would avoid a fee, the funds should still be available, as it's a government check and then you'll have a bank.

mwkfirjRaa	If they cut the check in 2008, then you need to report it as 2008 income.  If they do send you a 1099, the IRS records will not agree with your records and they will send you a tax bill, including interest and penalties.  Definitely not worth the hassle!    Did you know you could have requested that the company delay sending you payment until January?  Most will comply if you make the request.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The company cut the check in 2008, so yes, you put it on the 2008 tax return and can file anyway since the form isn't attached to the tax return anyway.    I would photocopy the check and keep that with my tax records.    Then, when you finally get the 1099-Misc, if by any chance it says 2009 instead of 2008 you contact the company and demand that they reissue it as 2008.  (This is unlikely--clearly they intended to pay you in 2008 since they mailed the check before 12/31.)    The reason I like to wait is that my old consulting job paid me for my expenses.  I didn't know for sure until I got the 1099-Misc if they were using an accountable plan or a non-accountable plan.  They said they were on an accountable plan which would have made my taxes easy to do and if I'd been ready to file, I might have sent them in.  When the 1099-Misc showed up, they had retroactively decided to be a non-accountable plan and had added the expenses to box 7.  If I had already filed, I would have had to amend the return to add the income and expenses.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	File it on 08'. You don't need the 1099 to file , it has no federal withholding|`|bAulU9v1aa	Generally, income is determined by the cash method.

I'd wait a week or two and see if it shows up before filing your taxes.|`|AA10469473	If the check was cut in 2008, then it's 2008 income and should show on your 2008 return, even though you didn't actually receive it until the first week of 2009.    They should show it on the 2008 1099.  And yes, it'll come back to haunt you if you leave it off of your 2008 return.
vUiUoamVaa	sound good to me, but no, social security and medicare do not give refunds on withholding.|`|AA10469473	Not unless you are married filing a joint return, and that's your total joint income, or you have a dependent or some deductions or credits you didn't mention.  If you are a dependent and made over $5450, or single and made over $8950, you'll owe some income tax.  You might still get some of your withholding back, or might not.
TwqIpHJLaa	Yes, the IRS will take complaints but typically doesn't want you to call them on this issue until 15 Feb.  Businesses have until 2 Feb (Monday) to get their W-2s and 1099s into the mail so you ought to give them a little more time to make it to your home.      You can also file a substitute Form 1099 using Form 4852.  This document will have to be signed by you, include the best figures you have or can get with respect to payments and taxes withheld.  It also asks what efforts you've made to collect the actual 1099.      So I think your first order of business is to call the company or stop by and visit and ask them when you can expect your 1099 for 2008.    Good luck!|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Backup.

If so, that is your problem.

When both spouses work, you need to change your W-4s to reflect Single (or Married but withhold at the higher Single rate; they're the same thing).  The one with the higher income claims any exemptions and the other claims 0.    Alternatively you can have an additional $40 per week withheld from your wages.

Then if you ever open a bank account, which I do not reccommend if you owe money, the lender can put a levy on your account and take EVERY cent you have when you are not expecting it. There is no notice on this action and hopefully you aren't writing checks or have automatic payments being deducted, because this by itself can cause MORE bad credit and banking fees for non-sufficient funds. (And the lender can and WILL do this at very random intervals until they are paid in full.). And lastly, they can put a lien on any future monies you receive, i.e., tax returns, lottery winnings, inheritances, etc. Lovely, isn't it?    I've been there and it ain't pretty. My best advice is to try to make or take a settlement offer with the lender. Your very last resort is to save a couple hundred dollars when you get a job and file for bankruptcy (unless this is a student loan or child support, as these can NEVER be discharged). You can even tell the judge this is your plan. Nowadays, judges try to make lenders settle the debts for less than the original note and debtors can work out payment plans to avoid this. The theory behind that is the lender gets some or most of their loan back and you don't have horrible credit for 10 years. (Bankruptcy destroys your credit for up to 10 years.)     With that said, you will not have your furniture or clothing sold at auction, despite what you may read on the internet. You are not Marilyn Monroe or JFK, so no one will want to buy your used stuff and it wouldn't even bring in anything close to what you owe.    For future reference, if you can't afford to pay for something outright with cash in hand, then you can't afford it, period. Loans should be for cars and mortgages ONLY. Don't get another credit card. If you can't afford that stereo or $90 pair of shoes NOW, what makes you think you can afford it at the end of the month with the added interest of extending you the credit to have it when you wanted it? And if you CAN afford it at the end of the month, BUY IT THEN WITH CASH. Best of luck on your future endeavors. Keep your head up, get a job, pay your debts, and take care of you.|`|o5aHZ1Xdaa	This is a very tough situation, and something that is unfortunately effecting a lot of people at this time.    If you go to court, they judge will very likely rule in the lenders favor. They lender will be able to take everything you have with any value (basically, emptying your pockets and your place of residence; cloths, cars, electronics, etc.) AND THEN garnish (take a large percentage of) any wages/earnings you receive until your debt is paid off, with a considerable amount of interest.    i would recommend contacting the lender (preferably in person) and negotiate with the, a gesture of good faith. Don't look for any hand-outs -- you are defiantly not going to get any at this point -- but they may work with you for an out of court remedy that wont totally DESTROY your financial future.    I know you know this now, but for everyone else: In the future, don't ever spend beyond your means, EVER, if it is absolutely necessary (i still don't really see why it would ever be) you HAVE TO keep up with your payments, and if you cant you HAVE TO keep consistent contact with your lender. If they sue you and win you, and your loved ones, will be their slave for a long, long, time.    good luck, and i am really sorry that this is happening to you,    Shamar|`|AA12283595	File for bankruptsy!|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	umm you end up in debt to them and when you get a job you're forced to pay what the court grants them in increments i think|`|nIfOozNNaa	it depends how much you owe and what conditions u have with ur lender, if u loan is with the bank depending on the conditions they make take assets you have thought of, however if i was u i would just expanding my payment if u have to pay the money back within a year change it to spread the costs over 3 because banks need the money due to our current economic problems  i would discuss this situation with the bank  p.s im only a business studies high school student, so i may be incorrect

yJSPecgoaa	[Thank goodness for the warning given by n0spam4me.   I do hope you are paying heed to it.]    I don't doubt for a minute that your mother is way more intelligent than most people out there.  Unfortunately, with the marketplace being what it is, people with the sort of education and raw high intelligence your mother possesses are usually passed over in favor of those who, even with far less education and intellectual horsepower, nevertheless possess the sort of technical skills your mother may lack.     It personally pains me to think that someone of your mother's caliber and intelligence might have difficulty finding a job.  She has so very much to offer....and yet, the marketplace is very different now than it was 20 years ago, and  these are extremely difficult economic times...    I'll be very honest with you.  At your mother's age, unless she has been taking computer courses, she will qualify for very little in the marketplace, even amongst jobs for which only a high school diploma is required.  Even "mere" receptionists these days, who only need a high school degree, are still expected to be fluent and fully competent in Excel, Power Point, Microsoft Office and the like.    Had your mother been born 30+ years later, she *automatically* would be a whiz at such things, just like every other young person out there nowadays.    I know you're concerned that "teaching doesn't pay well," but it pays a whole lot better than the menial jobs she isn't even qualified for--even with her high intelligence--because, like most people in her age group, she likely lacks the necessary computer skills most young people today readily master long before they graduate from high school.    I would suggest she consider tutoring.  Depending upon what part of the country you live in, your mother can easily make anywhere from $20 to $75 an hour, even if she tutors at the grade school level.  Further, with her love of books (Charles Dickens no less!), she'd be a great tutor at the middle and high school levels as well.  She can begin by joining an established tutoring group or agency, and later, once she has established a good reputation and/or a following, she can go out on her own, thereby making even more money.    Keeping my fingers crossed for your mom, and sending all good thoughts her way.|`|PKfh0jhLaa	Just a caution  ... there will be LOTS of "answers" to this question that are links to somekinda money making exclusive club on-line and gee it only costs $5 to join and members are posting pictures of checks they have received for hundreds of dollars... ya, right & I'm the easter bunny!

ZeDjn4cVaa	You do not have to take the interest deduction on the mobile home mortgage.    However, everyone is entitled to mortgage interest deduction on up to $1,000,000 for the purchase or improvement of a first or a second home.  A second home is any home you own and do not use for business or rental.  So, the home that you allow your family member to live  in would qualify as a potential second home. If you have more than one potential second home, then chose to deduct the interest on the second home whose qualified mortgage interest is highest.  If you have no other potential second home, then by all means deduct the mortgage on the mobile home on your schedule A.  If later you buy a different second home with higher mortgage interest cost than the  mobile home, you can switch your second home to the second home that gives you the greatest tax deduction.      All the property taxes on all your homes or real estate (no matter how many you own) are deductible as property taxes, so don't forget to include any taxes for the mobile home on your schedule A.     Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  Enrolled Agent    This advice was  based upon my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.  See my profile for more infromation.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	You'll be fine.  Not deducting the interest leaves your income higher.  The government is happy to let you claim all income and no deductions.|`|AA10469473	you can safely ignore it

TwqIpHJLaa	First part of your question has been answered correctly.  No, you did not finance their loan.  The fed's insured the buyer's loan through the FHA.  That transaction doesn't concern or affect your taxes.    You take your mortgage interest deduction on Schedule A, line 10, which reads "home mortgage interest and points from Form 1098."    Good luck!|`|vVTmJjJDaa	nope - skip it - you didn't finance it - the government did.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	"got their own loan via FHA"--so YOU didn't finance it.  Thus you aren't getting the money and have no interest to impute.    You apparently answered a question wrong in the interview.

You don't need your parents for a private account with bank of america.|`|L0jeEhChaa	same thing happened with my son and his dad (his dad and I are divorced) see if you can take her off your account, you may not be able to till your 18 though. change your pin number on your ATM, or speak to a banking representative. They may be able to put something in place that requires BOTH of your signatures before she can withdraw money.|`|7VnmPYuXaa	Well, she has a legal right to take money from your account because she is the custodian.  I totally agree and do not believe that it is right at all for what she did. What's even more interesting is that she didn't tell you that she was going to pay it back.  I could see if she needed money quick and then she used it and was going to repay what she took, but to just take it and leave it at that..!      I would not try to get her in trouble and I think that your actions going forward will teach her the lesson that you want to teach her.  I would keep your money in a safe until you are 18 and then open up your own checking / savings account.      Oh, I would just give her the $200 as well and tell her that she needs it more than you and you would rather just give it to her instead of her stealing it later....... It will be a matter of principle and it will really make the point that you are trying to make.       Start your own funds from scratch again and don't let mom know your financial situation.|`|CvVgihRtaa	Hi,  I'm sorry to hear about what your Mom did.  Of course she may think she did nothing wrong since she cared for you in your growing up years plus her reasons for the funds were legitimate.  But she should have asked you first.    I think you should not want to teach your Mom a lesson or try to get her into trouble.  Write off this incident as a learning experience and let it be the first and last time you be swindled of your hard earned savings.    By all means start another savings account if you wish, but remember it is always best to have beneficiaries on you account.      However, since you are wiser now, you must stipulate that you are the ONLY signee on the account and should anyone else on the account desires to withdraw funds then your signature must also be on the check.    All the best to you.|`|nKwcGLQraa	dude, what a B***H.|`|PxoKseAiaa	There is probably nothing you can do, since you are a minor, your mother is probably ON your bank account, meaning she has full access to it.

Also, saying that she never does anything for you is a fib, you do have a roof over your head and food right?|`|om2lE7jfaa	there is nothing you can do sadly, she is your legal guardian for the time being, she has full access to your account the wise thing to do would be cancel it until your 18, until then i guess rough lesson learned, trust no1 with your money.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Thats a felony actually since she took 500$ from you without your permission.    I say sue her *** even if she is your mother, that sh*t cant be tolerated as thats your hard earned money|`|0jQcNWITaa	I am sorry that your Mom did this to you. She should have asked you and let you know how badly she needed the money. You cannot take her to court being only 17. Perhaps you can find another adult to take her to small claims court. But that is still no promise you would ever see your money again.    Putting your money in the safe at home sounds like the best way to go until you turn 18.    I am sorry that your Mom did this very rude thing to you.  Good luck.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	try and talk to your mom   i know times are hard right now  say you will really appreciate if she would pay you back in the future  even if she could do monthly payments   try and be nice about it|`|8Y9timR4aa	take her to court|`|sIdoUK2Laa	oh man i'm sorry to hear that! what's up with your mom?  that's messed up.  good idea about your own account when you are 18.    sorry you can't trust your mom|`|P9inKWOaaa	she should have asked your right, but giving money to help instead of spending it on yourself is part of being a man, get used to it .|`|yJROr3Iraa	legally, until you're 18, your parents control all money you make through working but none of the money you get as gifts, so you can't really do anything unless more than $200 was birthday money or something.     so sorry! just do your best to guilt trip her|`|3keA0Rtnaa	No, there really isn't anything you can do to her. Just keep your money at home and talk to her about the problem. My mom did the same thing to me but she closed out the account and kept a hundred dollars because she said it was hers for co-signing with me! Never asked her to help me with anything since. Best of luck to you.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	I'm a little confused.  I'm assuming her name was on the account since you are still a minor.  If that's the case, then legally there is nothing you can do since she has the right to take money from the account.      If she's not on the account, that is theft, and there is a lot you can do.  Contact the police.    Either way, I think it's deplorable for your mother to do that.  I'm sorry you caught such a tough break.  I think your plan for the future sounds good.  Just stick with it and make sure she doesn't get the numbers to your safe.  Don't let her do any fancy talking to try to get her hands on your money.  Good luck.|`|we5DkJVVaa	Pretty sad situation you find yourself in, even sadder some of the advice being given here. I am sorry, you must be hurting as this is your Mom we are talking about and what she did is criminal. However sometimes we must look at the larger moral picture and decide what to do. Legally the bank has listed both you and Mom as co depositors so legally the money is both of yours. Morally we know the truth is different.    So what should you do? No, legally your Mom is in no trouble for what she did. Legally it was her money as well. I think closing the account is a wise move, keep the money well hidden in a location unknown to anyone else.    You have already confronted your Mom about this issue. She knows what she did is wrong. You know you are in the right. She does not have the money to pay you back as your family is broke. Yes it hurts. I am willing to bet your Mom feels bad about this issue she probably is just trapped by her circumstances and has been beat up by life.    What you should do is follow the example laid down by Jesus and forgive your Mom. It will make you feel a lot better. Do you actually believe your mom could repay you that money? Why did she take it in the first place? Forgive her and you may find a solution.|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Damn Bro you got owned...................................

Review them carefully.  1 out of 5 people have an error in their reports.  After you clean up your reports get one of the scores.  I recommend going to experian.com - about 7 bucks.  No need for expensive scores.    Note:  When applying for a mortgage, your lender will NOT look at your score.  They will look at your reports in detail.  They will make their own decisions based on your credit usage, your employment, and your salaries.    Do not open any new credit card accounts 6 months before applying.    And try to pay off any credit card in full before applying to get top credit, and best interest rates.  Any debt you have will directly reduce the monthly payment you will qualify for.  Do all your applications for mtg's in a 3 week window so they will be lumped as one - and not hurt your credit.  Put 20% down to avoid that nasty PMI, which is like throwing thousands away a year.  Do not let them bully you into variable rate loans - which are big money makers for them.  Stick to 15 or 30 year fixed.    Do not go with the scores - make sure your reports are pristine.  And be careful with other sites - they might not give you the full reports - or not give you a real score.  AND just charge you more.

It's usually someone who's freelancing; offering their skills to small businesses and companies, but it requires no less work, planning, and knowledge than a traditional 9-5 job situation and does come with it's own body of risks.    If you are still curious, try to figure out what skills you already have that can be made available on-line sitting at home, be it graphic design, web design, music, photography, digital imaging, sound engineering, illustration, writing, or more.

fNoDk12caa	Its not easy for suppliers to reach retailers easily. Manufacturers produce a large amount of products in a day and all the products go to the suppliers they have to handle huge volume of products which retailers can't take directly. It's dealers that take the load off from suppliers they supply to retailers and at the same time retain the products and store for future. Retailers can't buy all the products a manufacturer produces. In my opinion there was no need to have suppliers, distributors, retailers. Consumers could have got an option to buy from manufacturers directly to cut the cost by more than 70% but unfortunately its not how things work.

Assuming there is a stated value, what is the stated value of the common stock?  $1,200,000/600,000 = stated value of $2 per share    3. What is the par value of the preferred stock?  $600,000/6,000 = par value of $100    4. If the annual dividend on preferred stock is $30,000, what is the dividend rate on preferred stock?  $30,000/$600,000 = 5%    5. If dividends of $60,000 were in arrears on preferred stock, what would be the balance in Retained Earnings?  $1,858,000 - there is no change. Preferred dividends in arrears are not recognised in the financial statements. However they must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

I would recommend joining some web-based trading company that allows more specific orders to be placed.|`|	Buy @ 15 stop will cause a market order to go in when the stock trades at 15.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

And, any investment in helping people keep their homes will help not just those homeowners, but also all the other homeowners because, otherwise, their home values will keep declining if nothing is done to stop the foreclosures.    I also support giving jobs and aid to Main Street because we've already seen how irresponsible Wall Street has been with the money given to them.  They were given billions of taxpayer money to start lending again, and they didn't lend.  They just decided to give themselves bonuses and when asked to account for the money given to them in the bailout they basically said, scr*w you, we don't have to tell you (the taxpayers).|`|AA11906603	You would think if you listen to the Republicans who are whining now that Obama singlehandedly created this situation in the last 12 days and has no idea about what to do, compared to all the Republicans who know it all.

Many people are looking for work from home companies. All the scams definitely create a big problem but also, there is a problem of people misunderstanding the difference between work from home "jobs" and work from home opportunities. There really are not work from home “jobs”. To get that you have to start working for a company in their offices first, then they MAY allow you to take the job home.<br>  <br>  Most of the work from home opportunities that are legitimate offers are not an hourly pay type job. They are business opportunities that help you in starting your own business from your home. What you should do first is to decide if you are simply looking for an hourly rate type job or if you are looking for more of an opportunity for additional income such as what you would make in your own business being your own boss from home. Small home businesses have some small costs involved, less than $500 to start is reasonable and I would stay away from those wanting $1000-$5000. It doesn’t cost that much to start and run a home business so you shouldn’t pay it. <br>  <br>  If you are coming across places that say free then I would RUN don’t walk the other way! They never are. I tried them many a times and 3 weeks later I had to buy this and 6 weeks later that. After 6 months these “free businesses” had cost me over $800 on average.<br>  <br>  After trying 15 things I now work about 18-25 hours per week for a National Medical Healthcare Company. This is a nationally known and reputable home business which is what you need to make sure you are looking for. I have been with the company almost a year and a half now and I make over $4500 a month! In your first month, depending on how many hours you can work, I have seen people make anywhere from $500 to over $2500. And your income will increase each month because you get paid residual income as well. <br>  <br>  The best part is they have 401(k), direct deposit, life insurance and a benefits package most of which you get from day one. In addition, there are no products, no hard selling or pushing, no cold calling, no home parties and no telemarketing! That was VERY important to me. I absolutely love working with them and I can't believe I am making what I am making and in so few hours per week. The neat thing is there are other people on your team that you work with so you are never alone. You have great team support and you get to know the other people on your team pretty well. <br>  <br>  I was a bit apprehensive at first because I know a lot of companies are not legit but this company is the number one National Medical Benefits Company in the US. They are a member of the US Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Dental Plans and the owner of the company actually sits on the board of The Consumer Health Alliance to which we are also members. Also they were featured in “The New York Times”, “Wall Street Journal” “Time Magazine” “American Medical Review” and even in the May 2008 issue of “Parents Magazine”. Even “60 Minutes” did a big special on this home based business.<br>  <br>  Even more then all this is they are accepted at over 100,000 retailers nationwide. These are fortune 500 companies like Sears, Target, K-mart, Rite Aid, CVS, Wal-mart, Publix and more. These companies would never work with a company that was anything less than reputable. <br>  <br>  You can research the company at www.workathomeplus.net<br>   <br>  <br>  TOP 10 WORK AT HOME SCAMS:<br>  <br>  10. Craft Assembly <br>  <br>  9. Medical Billing <br>  <br>  8. Email/Rebate Processing <br>  <br>  7. "A List of Companies Looking for Home workers!" <br>  <br>  6. "Just pay for and take this class first”  Then we’ll give or find you a job! <br>  <br>  5. Typing At Home / Data Entry<br>  <br>  4. "Turn Your Computer Into a Money-Making Machine!" <br>  <br>  3. Pyramid Schemes (this is NOT the same as Multi-Level Marketing MLM)<br>  <br>  2. Chain Letters/Emails ("Make Money Fast") <br>  <br>  1. Envelope Stuffing <br>  <br>  Please beware of these scams. There are some legit home businesses out there so be careful. Look for companies in business over 10 years. Look for companies with a needed product or service, something you would be proud to represent. Look for companies that have a national reputation and are members of the US Chamber of Commerce.<br>  <br>  As for those of you who say…..”I want to work from home but I don’t want to have to pay for anything”. Well, that’s great! But it will never happen. Let’s be honest, there is no such thing as a free lunch. If  it is a true honest home business you need to expect to pay. Mr. Walt Disney didn’t start the Disney empire “without paying for anything”. Neither did Mr. Sam Walton, owner of Wal-Mart.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to learn about REAL home businesses visit: workathomeplus.net <br>  <br>   www.workathomeplus.net. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you in your search.

Try looking into investing money in foreclosed properties with property tax liens on the title, on average 20% of money is lost by the mortgage company in properties that go through sheriff's sale with the winning bid, so you're paying 80% of the market price of the house, then sell it again for full market value.|`|7b1d5447f72c26dfddad46cbc6b5ab07aa	 I would go with hard cash in an FDIC-insured savings or Money Market account. Also might want to go with an FDIC-insured CD. I do not think that gold will perform well either, against a backdrop of general price deflation in natural resources and commodity prices. Gold's price is just way too volatile, too. One week it's way up, next week it's way down. How can you plan, if you can't predict? So stick with cash.

However, likely shareholders will be one of the ones holding the bag on the bad investments the company held.  An investment in a bad investment is also a bad investment.  I don't know details of the shutdown and buyout so far so can't claim to be expert on this particular case, but, it sounds like the valuable assets were sold to JP Morgan/Chase, in order to keep the banking system and insured deposits stable; what's left of WaMu isn't the valuable stuff.  Secured creditors will be first in line for reimbursement; shareholders are usually last in line at the breakup buffet, and usually there's nothing left over at that point.  <br>  <br>  Stocks are a gamble; if the company does well and public opinion and intent to buy is high, you share in their success.

5d215ccfd1642e3e59afa15b855f6421aa	ok did you tell them that you worked hours that you didn't and if they go back and look they can see that you lied? or did they make the mistake? if they made the mistake then they can ask for the additional money they gave you back. if you made the mistake either by falsifying your timecard (lieing on the timecard and saying you were there when you werent or bying coming in punching in leaving, coming back and punching back out and not working) then they can get you for fraud, some sort of timecard fraud type thing, and they can have you arrest and press charges, i don't know what the penalties for that our, i'm imagining public service hours as well as heavy fines, and of course it could ruin your career. if you know that a mistake was made now is the time to come clean to them, say i was looking over some of my past paystubs while cleaning up my home filing and noticed that this one is wrong (hopefully it only happened on 1 pay stub) and bring it to HRs attention, they might want their money back but it sure beats the consequences otherwise.

Send a letter to several churches and synagogues in the area.  That you will help a young couple start their new life with a houseful of furniture and you will pay for the U-Haul.<br>  Then write to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and tell them that they can have a garage sale of all of your possession but they have to have the sale at their headquarters. Once again, you will pay for the U-Haul if they will provide the labor. And you will pay to haul any unsold items to the dump.<br>  When you interview realty agents, tell them that part of earning their commission is that they must have the furniture removed when the sale closes.  They may end up giving it to a family member but you won't  care..
VI7phxR7aa	Hi,    It seems California does not grant common law marriage, but does recognize common law marriage that is acquired in states that do support Common Law Marriage.  Thus unless you were married under common law in a supporting state, such as Texas, you cannot claim to be married this year.    Hope that helps,  Evan|`|AA10469473	Most states don't even recognize common law marriages any more, and CA is one that does not.  So no, you can't file a joint return.  If you get married this year you could file joint next year for 2009, but can't for 2008.    See http://www.cadivorceonline.com/calpages/...    See http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/ObjectID... or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-law_... for more info    And even that  site isn't up to date - PA for example stopped recognizing common law marriage.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	It is not optional under any circumstances.    If you are married as defined by the laws of your state, including a common law marriage, if you live in a state with common law marriage, then you must file as married.    If you have lived together only in a state without common law marriage or do not meet the definition of a common law marriage under the laws of the states in which you have lived together, then you must file as single, until you either marry or are simultaneously both living in a state with common law marriage and meeting that state's definition of a common law marriage.

5d215ccfd1642e3e59afa15b855f6421aa	well if you don't have any account manager experience, i'd say doubtful. If you have accounting type, then maybe your chances are ok. However, you have to consider that your husband's boss is going to dislike the idea of hiring you wether you have experience or not solely because of the fact that you are married. A lot of places don't like to fire people who are related. Pretty much every application you fill out anywhere says do you have any relatives who work for us? It's not always fair but thats the way it works. i'd say no probably not. sorry.

MmTe8W8uaa	A "tax return" is a document that you send to the government.  The money that you want the government to send to you is called a "tax refund".    If you have no other income, and have no dependents, 2 is approximately the correct number to claim, but will result in a small refund or none.  If you want a large refund or have a large amount of other taxable income (such as interest or dividends), you should claim fewer (0 or 1).  If you have dependents, you should claim more.    You can submit a new Form W-4 at any time.  It may take a few weeks to be processed by your employer or your employer's payroll service.  Once processed, it supercedes all prior Form W-4's (with respect to future paychecks only).  There is no need to "change" the earlier ones.    Note that the amount you receive is based on the total amount that was withheld over the year, and not directly based on the number claimed on any particular Form W-4.  For example, if you submit a new Form W-4 in late December, it will have little effect of that year's return, because most of the money withheld for the year was withheld from paychecks issued earlier in the year.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	you can change your w-4 at work at any time you like and as many times as you like to.yes you are claiming too many exemptions.    if you want a tax refund you will need to lower your number of exemptions,so that more taxes can be withheld from your paycheck each week,resulting possibly in a bigger tax refund.so change it to 0 if you want the most taken or 1 if you want just a little more taken and of course keep your status as single.|`|AA10469473	If you claim 2 you'll either get a small refund or owe a small amount.  If you claim 1 or 0 you'd get a refund if that job is your only income.    To change it, just fill out another one and turn it in the same place as you turned in the first one.|`|161de69a9833dd88dea520e119827c7caa	1) Determine the proper number of exemptions for a "$0 refund" tax return.  2) Claim exemptions to result in $0 refund.   3) Determine the size of "refund" you want come tax season.  4) Divide desired refund by number of paychecks per year (26 if you're paid biweekly) and have that amount directed to an interest bearing savings account.  5) Pretend the savings account doesn't exist until tax time.    You'll increase your "refund" by earning interest on it instead of loaning it to the government at 0%. You also have the option of getting the refund as early as you want in the new year. You will be impervious to $150 refund anticipation loans because you will have your money before you even file the tax return!
AA10469473	Is he the baby's biological father?  If so he can claim the baby as a qualifying child.  The way you phrase your question though sounds like he isn't.  If not, he definitely can't file as head of household, or get EIC or other child related credits for the baby.    If you had income for 2008 over $3500 total, he definitely can't claim you, and can't claim the baby unless he is his bio father.    If you lived with him ALL of 2008 and you didn't have $3500 or more income and he provided over half of your support, he can claim you if there are no laws where you live making your relationship illegal.  If your relationship violates any state or local ordinance, he can't though whether the law is currently enforced or not - and believe it or not there are still many places with laws on the books with laws against cohabitation by unmarried couples.

This will deplete your cash value in you policy if you don't.  Talk to the company or person that sold you the policy to get the specifics.|`|Po6Bhqfoaa	Some policies have a cash surrender value.  Some do not.    You could ask my relatives, they have probably insured and borrowed off me many times, waiting for the day. I am like a cat with nine lives.  I don't want to die.    First time they had me insured was not my parents idea at all. My parents were decent people.. They canceled the insurance on me.  Had done nothing to merit killing,  no one ever asked my side of anything They  would have been quite surprised, obviously, had they, astonished in fact.    I thought about taking out a burial policy so my kids would not be stuck with the bill, but I am terrified to do so, the people here are ruthless and older people have so little value in society any way to people.especially here.My creditors or their lawyers would think nothing of killing me. I do not fear my kids.  Now we older ones are just good to do the dirty jobs and the  non paying  volunteer work or just die.

Cash value is about 10% of what you've paid in.|`|y6HmMl9naa	My parents got money through their Universal life policy. their policy had cash value, you should contact your Insurance agent to give you more info.

Call your insurance agent and ask.|`|WCZLDvJBaa	There are two types of life insurance.  Permanent (whole life, universal life) and term life insurance.  Permanent life insurance policies have cash values sometimes not for a year or two.  You can borrow the cash value from the insurance company, usually at a fixed rate shown in the policy.
JXJvxhZPaa	Educational credits are not dollar for dollar equivalents to how much you pay--there is a formula that is used to calculated them.  It's something like 100% of the first $1000 spent on tuition and 50% of the next $2000.  And that's it.  So if you spent $10,000 on tuition, you will only get a $2000 credit.  The child credit will increase the amount of money you get back, assuming you are not above the threshold income level.  When you hit a certain level of income, the credit is slowly reduced.  With both of you in school, however, I wouldn't think you would surpass the threshold income level.  I would wait for the childcare provider.|`|AA10469473	Each credit has a maximum.  And for most credits, including education and child care credits, you don't get anything if your tax is already at zero.  So if you have no tax liability and are already getting back everything that was withheld, no sense waiting for the child care form.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Most credits are not refundable and can only reduce your tax liability to $0.  If your tax liability is already $0, don't waste your time claiming them.  The exceptions to this are the Earned Income Credit, Additional Child Tax Credit, and the new First Time Home Buyer's Credit.  Those are refundable so if your tax liability is already $0, the excess will be paid to you as a refund.
ZeDjn4cVaa	You might receive  a 1099-DIV or 1099-B or both.  The 1099-DIV would report to you the amount of dividends paid by the account and any capital gain distribution.  The 1099-B would report to you if any mutual funds (other than money market funds) were sold during the year.  If you have a 1099-B, the mutual fund should be able to tell you the cost basis of the funds sold.  You gain would be the difference between the cost and the 1099-B proceeds.    You can all the toll free number of the mutual fund and ask what documents they will send you. If you have online access to your mutual fund account, then usually there is a place for "tax statements or forms" after you have logged, where you could see and priint out the tax documents your self.

NDjPx9I9aa	Most places nowadays require you pay first (Usually to avoid thefts)|`|bNSv3imvaa	It depends on the gas station. Some do require you to pay before you pump the gas because of problems with people who drive off without paying. In Iowa, most places you just pump the gas and go in and pay for it. There is no receipt. The people at the register can see how much is spent on each pump. You pay your bill and then you're on your way.|`|AA10823513	You will have to pay first before pumping, that avoids drive offs without paying.

L0yNkZBBaa	If you speak with the landlord, they will have both of you sign a roommate release form which will allow for one of you to leave.

However, whichever roommate decides to leave forfeits their right to the security deposit.

If you escrow and trust yourself to be able to pay taxes/insurance when it is due, then maybe stop escrow, that is extra money every month, then pay taxes/insurance early when/if you get a tax return refund in early spring.<br>    Obviously, no concrete answers, but you need to seriously talk to your lender, they may have more appropriate answers to make it easier on your pocket book.|`|36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	the mortgage companies and banks are in a bind themselves. They don't want or need another house in foreclosure and you don't need to file bankruptcy. At this point in the game I would highly suggest you contact the mortgage holder and explain the situation.

(if you're foreclosed on you will still owe your loan and your credit is ruined. but  if you go bankrupt, then your house will be sold and all of your debt would be wiped out but your credit would be messed up until the bankruptcy is discharged.)<br>  <br>  have a consult with a bankruptcy lawyer and let them tell you which is in your best interest for the long term. (you can go through legal aid if you can't afford a lawyer)<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Follow Jeanne R's advice first.  a short sale should only be a last resort after you've done everything else and you are still looking at a foreclosure or a bankruptcy.|`|xoqQbHi1aa	You can work your way through this!  Don't give up!  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. The holidays are coming and there will be plenty of temporary jobs available. It is better to have a no fun year or two than a no fun decade. <br>  C.Do NOT get a home equity loan. Taking on more debt will not get you Out of debt.<br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  Look into getting your mortgage restructured.  Part of the bailout package was to help homeowners in your situation.  Housing prices will go back up again, you just need to hold on.  You may have a "no fun" yeat or two but that is better than a no fun decade or two which is what you will get with either a bankruptcy or a foreclosure.  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan.<br>  <br>

However, the deduction that comes out of your paycheck that issues you the $10,000.00 can sometimes push you into a "higher tax bracket" than you are actually in and the amount withheld can be a higher percentage.

Another thing you can do is negotiate with your landlord if you have a skilled trade - for example trade your carpentry skills for discounted rent. There may be charities or social services agencies that may be able to provide rental assistance.     The only real fix to your problem is to find someplace to live that you can afford. I know people don't like to hear that, but if you're paying more than 1/3 your income in housing than it will poison many other aspects of your life.

Work it with your child(ren) to teach them self sufficiency. (And you get cheap labor!)  Make sure it is a real product that isn't a scam or pyramid.  Pick something that has a recurring income, no inventory, and a high need. Make sure it is something that no one else has.. If you do that, you'll make what you want.  (I sell an investment program that really is one of the best, and only we offer it. Unique. Good for customer and me too.)     Good luck!|`|b29b8933d49526f53444fe74fb26cc64aa	Hi..single mom?/ Yep..me, too. I have tried this simple program.

w9rfIlKJaa	I still don't have enough information to give you an accurate answer. It looks like your EIC will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $111.00. You may qualify for a larger credit if your income was higher last year and you were in an area that was declared to be a federal disaster area. The best way to tell how much you will get back is to use one of the free tax software programs such as trubotax (some versions you have to pay for, but they do have some free software)
NwkZ5OmCaa	When you withdraw money from a 401K and you are younger than 59.5, the tax implication will be horrible if you have any other income that year.  There is no way around this (short of taking only a little bit of the money at a time).    While they withhold 10% for tax (and another 10% for penalty), the 10% is woefully inadequate.  I'm in the 25% tax bracket most years, so I would owe 25% on the 401K money, meaning I'd have to come up with another 15% from either withholding or a check.    Others have low income and depend on EIC--but getting the 401K money will change your AGI and can reduce the amount of EIC you are eligible for....|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Don't put in over the maximum, and you will not be taxed. If you put in over the maximum, it will be taxed. There is no way around it. So you shouldn't put in over the max.If you wan to save more than a 401(k) allows, you should put your money into a regular, taxable investment account that you are completely in control of, and that allows you to invest in anything.    If you want to get into mutual funds, I recommend Vanguard, because their fees are the lowest. If you want to trade individual stocks, open an account at a low cost broker. TD Ameritrade, Scott Trade, etc.    The maximum that you can contribute tax free to a 401(k) was $15,5000 for 2008, and is $16,500 for 2009.
fe85493e1f4a412e33463450bc1057d5aa	What kind of connection are trying to make.  If it's on a personal level, try giving him a seasonal card, a thank you note for a recent spiff or boon in your paycheck, any excuse to endear yourself to him.  Work places are very dynamic situations and when we have change, it really affects us.    What were some of the connections you had with your old bosses, and what are you looking for here?  Is it a professional connection?  Perhaps you could just have a sit down with him and talk about what you were expected to do for John Doe in department x before you came over to his group, and if that's what he expects from you, or is there something else?      You being older gives you some credibility as well.  He would be pretty lame not to expect you to know your job and how to do it.  If you approach him with the intention of getting the job done as he sees it happening, the connections will come.  At least he'll know where you're coming from and perhaps he'll let you in on his world as well.    Good luck, and remember that sometimes the only thing that works is time...|`|41192d5f2cac178283e1bd7eb8ccc3e0aa	I'm not sure what kind of a "relationship" you want with your new boss.   What do you mean by "connection"?  My suggestion would be to learn to be content with a "get along" report and accept the fact that a work-relationship does not involve being emotionally, mentally, or physically connected with your boss.  If he's a considerate boss appreciate that fact as many bosses are micromanaging, egotistical, power mongers.

Did you ever heard that if u r going for a job and employer ask you for money before hiring? After lot of search, I have found one website, where you can make $600 in a month working at home. The work need to be done is posting a discussion and answering a discussion. the link is:    http://tinyurl.com/yhzzph    But there is nothing called free lunch and you have to work if you want to make more and more money. When i said $600, i meant in a month, if you will work hard you can even make $1000 or more.. it all depends on your usage pattern. How u get money is through posting a discussion and replying to discussion. I worked for 1 hour daily last month and i got paid $238 for the last month.

I am an employer, and I can't believe how many people tell me personal things such as - I'm a Scorpio, I have a cat named Bobo, my mother told me to come here, I love romantic walks on the beach etc.) None of that stuff is important or interesting to the interviewer.     They want to know how you got interested in this job. Here's a sample answer:    Well, I have been interested in plumbing ever since I saw my dad fixing our sink, and ever since then, I have always been the one in our house to fix anything. After graduating high-school, I decided to go to ABC college to get a certificate in specialized plumbing as well as to obtain my gas fitters license. Etc. etc..     Make it a timeline of relevant information. Be prepared for the question as most people will ask it in one form or another. Be pleasant and confident about your answer. Don't think about it too long as if you are thinking of making something up.     I could go on and on, but I'll stop for now!     Hope this helps!|`|e7d7dfc30f09b6ccc9e5e15215b5a633aa	Your answers are going to be job related..Tell them about your background, your education..Describe your strongpoints..Most important, don't forget to tell them what you can do for them..Interviewing is about selling yourself, convincing them that you are the best candidate.|`|ebd4116f333f698015886841f1388eafaa	Keep it brief and upbeat!

It's not all about skills, which is why employers ask that question.      In my case, I would state that I am married, no children, my husband works for the County. (without gushing out too many details, these things denote personal stability.)    I would tell them that I am very involved in volunteer work (don't make it up, if you aren't!  It can bite you in the butt, especially in a small town!)  This shows that you are non sellf-absorbed.    Tell them about your hobbies, sports etc, which indicates that you are an involved, well-rounded person, with diverse interests.      Good Luck!!|`|QH42mrP0aa	well that would depend on what you've done in your life.    here is an example.  one thing you need to try not to do is hesitate.

Julie--  Lets see I was just married 8 months ago and we are enjoing or life together.  And for the past 2 years I've been volunteering at the local hospital.  I've been filing papers and talking to the patients.  It has been a very rewarding experience.  When I was not doing that I worked at the Home Depot in the lighting department.

I'm self motivated and care alot about my co workers.  I'm a team player and work well with others.       There is so much you can say and should say but be careful not to over do it.  They mostly just want to hear you talk.  They want to see how you can communicate with them.  Before you walk in think that they are your best friends.

TwqIpHJLaa	Taxes are a creature of law...not ethics.  It is entirely lawful to take a tax deduction for charitable contributions, including donations to the church.    I'm not aware of any ethical issues implicated in taking such a deduction.  You're still rendering to Caesar those things that are Caesar's and to God what is God's.      Interpretations include the belief that it is good and appropriate to submit to the state when required to do so by law AND that spiritual demands supersede earthly demands but do not abolish them.    Hope this helps.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The ethic is that our society believes that churches do good by existing and provide more value to our society than the loss of tax dollars the donors got on their tax returns.    Since tithes are cash, the math is relatively simple.  The minister's salary is taxed anyway, the money is spent, etc, so the money gets back in to the system.    The piece I have trouble with are the people who drop bags and bags of clothes they no longer want off with the Salvation Army and then put $$$ on their tax return to get a non-cash deduction.  Charities routinely throw away 70% of the stuff they receive as junk--meaning they didn't get anything for the donation either.  The IRS finally clamped down on car donations (you only get a deduction for what the charity was able to sell the car for), but I feel they should disallow the other donations.|`|bdd7d896b89fd31804e7891c35b2c4e6aa	Yes.

The lender will payoff any existing notes against the home just like a regular refinance and to the best of my knowledge they will only sit in 1st lien position. You still hold title to the property just as normal. Your loan will be for a specific amount however instead of sending a check to the lender they send you one! Interest accumulates against the loan as it would with any other loan.    To qualify you must be 62 years or older and their must be so much equity in the property. These loans are managed by HUD and are highly regulated.    Before spending any money trying to get info on these programs go to www.hud.gov. Click the link for seniors and then reverse mortgage. There is a ton of info there. Also the AARP has a ton of info on these programs.    Good luck    Kevin 866-562-6838 x 106  kruorock@firstratelending.com

For financing a business 10% down payment (called equity investment) is a minimum and 20% is more typical.  Hypothetically, a gas station project could take in excess of $1,000,000 (or more) to start and therefore you will need $200,000 cash for your part of the project (or more).

AA11370600	Assuming that you have good credit the rate will depend on the type of 2nd your looking for and your state.    If you're interested in a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) then you're looking at Prime (8.25%) minimum. At that loan amount figure a 1/2 point add to the margin +/- so somewhere around 8.75% interest only.     If you're talking about a fixed 2nd then you are most likely in the 7.625% or slightly higher.    Closing costs on a 2nd are typically ALOT lower than a new 1st (refinance) since title and escrow is cheeper. Depending on the lender you go with many have a low or no closing cost option but will have a small early closure fee to reimburse them for their 3rd party costs of title and escrow. This is usually in the $500-$750 range if you close with in 3 years of opening the line.    I agree with the above poster however. You should look at what the payment with you existing 1st and a new 2nd will be and also find out what a cash out refinance will put you at. You may find that with a new refinance that you will pay yourself back for the closing costs and reap 20-25 years of overall lower payments. Really check this out... it can save you thousands per year in interest payments. You can go to my companies site for a mortgage calculator. Use this to see what your payments could be either way. No application required.    If you would to discuss your scenario in detail, drop me a line.

It is easy to do the math on this just add it up over the term of your loan.  Take the one that works best for you, don't forget that closing cost are based off of your loan amount, keep that in mind for your calculations, also keep an eye on your LTV (loan to value) don't go over 80% or you will have PMI

TwqIpHJLaa	I've not read anything directly on point but in your situation I'd file an amended return with the federal govt.      My reasoning:  The States and Federal govts routinely share info on taxpayers and using different figures on the two tax returns is likely to invite inquiries.  Moreover, the 1098-T or other interest stmt from the lender has likely also been provided to the IRS and the differing interest figure on your return (although clearly not altered to your financial advantage) could, again, trigger an inquiry.    Hope this helps.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Based on your situation, skip the 1040X for federal.  There's nothing to change.

X5eH20qzaa	One's refund or tax payment is based on the difference between one's total tax and what has already been paid.  It sounds like his employer is not deducting the appropriate amount.    Is he a statutory employee?  This is common in a commissioned sales position when the individual is paid on a W2.  In such a case, the employer will not deduct income tax and the individual is responsible for quarterlies.    In any case, as long as the IRS doesn't consider his underpayment excessive, and you have the money to pay the tax, this is actually a good thing.  Most people look forward to a big return, not understanding that this represents an interest-free loan they've given Uncle Sam.  In your case, it's the other way around.    .|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	It's not that he's working overtime, but that his total income isn't working the standard W-4 logic.

For 2009, I would recommend that you sit down quarterly with the pay stubs, go to irs.gov and run the withholding calculator and let it estimate your yearly income from the ytd-estimates and make a recommendation.  Or you can sit down and do a minit tax return on your own and do the same guestimates.

Regardless of how he files, if he wants to avoid paying the IRS when he files his tax return, he can fill out a new W-4 & have add'l monies withheld from his paycheck.    Contact the employers' HR or personnel dept, or go to http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf to download the form & give to the employer.    If you haven't already, the 2 of you should consider filing jointly (MFJ) vs. separately (MFS), as this generally will be more to your advantage.  You can calculate both ways to see which provides a better outcome for the two of you.  If one of you filed as MFS already, you can amend that tax return to MFJ by sending the IRS a 1040X.  For a 1040X, go to http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040x.pd... to download this form.

0S7JNY5Aaa	You r Parents dependent I would think.  So if you just had wages use a 1040EZ but make sure you don't claim yourself.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	No they don't require documentation - these deductions are what the IRS gives you if you DON'T itemize.  If you DO itemize, then you need receipts, etc.  You don't have any deductions beyond school tuition & expenses and learning credits that I can see.   Be sure your parents can't claim you before you file.  EDIT:  If you have deductions that total $5450 or more (the standard deduction) then you should itemize (i.e. you "beat" the $5450 figure), if not (more than likely not) then claim the standard deduction.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Go to irs.gov, print off a schedule A.  Look at it.  The only 2 lines that you are likely to have are a) state and local income taxes (or sales tax) and b) the charity line.    Without a house, the odds are you simply do not have anything that goes on this form that is going to add up to more than $5450.    Medical, maybe, but it has to exceed 7.5% of your total income.  As a waitress, you shouldn't have any unreimbursed business expenses to sneeze at.  (Even then, it'd have to be more than 2% of your total income.)    I won't even go near the exemption issue.  According to you, you do meet either the support or the time test to be claimed as a dependent.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	well to start you are under 24 and a full time student, are you your parents dependent? Standard deduction does not require documentation, It is the amount5 the government allows you before you become subject to a liability.$5450.00 is standard and a itemization makes dollar for dollar over that not taxable to you, if you can beat 5450.00 go ahead and itemize.  Write off? for what? school? Education credits are available. Don't see any unreimbursed employee expense.     I think you need to seek a pro and get educated on taxes your first year out.Good Luck
tw44fqCpaa	Yes.  Put it on Schedule C Line 27 Other Expenses|`|vUiUoamVaa	That is darn iffy...Paypal was not around when the tax laws were written.  I would tend to think that is a 'business expense' therefore it is deductible, but...  I would give it a try.|`|oiOtOD0Taa	Yes, It's a business expense just like bank charges, interest paid etc.
NwkZ5OmCaa	Possibly.    Call 1-800-304-3107 and see if your SSN is flagged for a refund interception.
vzqKVGnsaa	I check the costumer reviews for every product that I plan to buy. If all the reviews are bad I want buy it. If it's 50/50 I'll think about it and buy it only if I really like it. If more than 50% are good reviews i will probably buy that product. If there is no review, I will look for it on some other website :)    +-------------------------------------...|`|98eb82548cca88f7da53bfcb622f91ceaa	I rely heavily on consumer reviews before buying something. I always check for customer reviews, written and in video.|`|oiOtOD0Taa	Customer reviews can influence me. For example, they might bring up that an important feature is missing, or consistent reviews of poor quality would turn me off.|`|YMBB6q5Vaa	if its something that i only kinda want i'll look at the reviews. if  reviews are bad then i wont buy it. but if its something that i really want to buy then i wont even bother to check what other people thing

That should be fun and I'm not sure why you have to do this but when learning is the goal humor and stories are 2 of the best methods!
