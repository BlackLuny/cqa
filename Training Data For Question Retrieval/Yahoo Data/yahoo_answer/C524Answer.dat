5rJ6nf2oaa	I know how you feel, really. Believe it or not but this is all good news. Your diet is working and you are merely detoxing. The toxins have to come out, through your skin, breath, bowels etc and at the time it isn't pleasant I know. But this phase will not last so please don't give up now. Usually after a couple of weeks you will feel a lot better and all of that will have stopped. Drinks lots of water to help flush everything out, and exercise too because you will also eliminate toxins through sweating. This will speed it up. Better out than in as they say. Well done so far and good luck.|`|djUMvICoaa	Your body is reacting to something new.  You didn't expect to change a life style and not have a little trouble getting there did you?  But how much sugar is on your menu yet?  That is one big reason for gas and one thing your body doesn't need.  Also, how much water have you been drinking?   It's nature's natural cleanser.  But if it continues you might have something else that's been hiding and could now come out or be felt.|`|1rcnc56Waa	A sudden change in diet isn't good for you, thats why we always do baby steps. Its equivelent to a person who never exercised running the marathon, it an't going to be pretty the after effects.<br>  <br>  For stomach pains, try eating less chilly, if thats the case. Gassy with stomach pains n bad breath could be a gastric ulcer. Need not be, but that is something that it presents with.<br>  <br>  Bad breath can be anything from, food stuck inbetween your teeth.<br>  See if you feel better with your normal diet, and slowly change.<br>  <br>  Even if with your regular diet you feel bad, go see the doctor.<br>  Its better to get treated early, then waiting for complications and bills to pile up

Unless, he was sexually active before you and the chlamydia has not shown up until recently.|`|mAp90hEeaa	His test more than likely will not come back negative and unless he shows you a piece of paper, do NOT believe his words when he gets the results.  He is lying to your face.  Do you really believe he would admit to cheating?  You need to get treated then re-evaluate your relationship.  He also needs to be treated at the same time that you are, otherwise if you continue to have sex with him, you can easily be re-infected and need treatment again.|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	it is possible to come negative, but please talk to your boyfriend.<br>  my roomy got the same thing, and her boyfriend manned up and told her he cheated on her with someone. <br>  <br>  that might not be the case with you, it might have been some other thing, but please check yourself again, and i do hope you get better
ODvnyAdlaa	no not at all x
xvey8ixPaa	Usually this happens when a person is stressed, does not have enough sleep, drinks a lot of caffeine, and might have some busy stuff going on. It usually will get worse if your situation gets stressed. Even good stress is stress! Like a vacation or a party! So, Sleep your full 8hours. eat your 5-7 fruits and veggies. Take a multi vitamin, Walk around the block a couple times on your break to vent stress hormone. Drink your 8 glasses of water a day! Drink less caffeine! Take some time to relax. Warm compresses are a good thing to take some time to do....it helps you to have some relaxation time too!

kiKB7tdaaa	There are some key flaws in your weight loss plan, which you really need to change, but you are on the right track. The primary flaw is how much you are eating. 800-1000 calories is FAR too little. When you eat so little, it slows down your metabolism and causes your body to store fat, not only hintering weight loss but making you feel sickly and weak. So little food could be considered starvation. For healthy weight loss, you ought to be eating about 1,500 calories per day.<br>    Your second flaw is your expectations. Weight loss takes much more time then 5 pounds a week, unless you are severly obese. You aren't all that heavy to begin with, so a realistic expectation is 1-2 pounds per week. Still, by May you should be able to lose a significant amount of weight, so don't stress!<br>     The exercise you are getting is exellent, but make sure you give yourself a little break every now and again if you need it. You don't want to wear yourself out! 5-6 days of exercise per week is ideal, because it will give your body a little time to rest. <br>     As for eating chocolate or junk food, thats fine. You shouldn't try to forbid yourself to ever eat it, because that's no fun. It's fine to have a treat 1-2 times per week, and more then just 100 calories of one too. Allow yourself some wiggle room, if you are craving a bowl of icecream or a slice of cake, let yourself have it once in awhile. If you do this, it can motivate you to stay healthy, because you can still have a little fun.<br>    Good luck, just be cautious not to go overboard. 28 pounds is a good goal, but keep in mind that if you aren't to lose all the wieght (say you only lose 10lbs or 20lbs) then you shouldn't be dissapointed. Losing any amount of weight is a great accomplishment!|`|05b3af152124c775d5129804746bbc06aa	If you eat that FEW calories; your body is going to go into "Starvation mode" and your weight loss will stop. <br>  <br>  Keep your calories UP to a MINIMUM to 1200 each day. Muscle toning will do far more to give you a svelte figure instead of just watching the scales.|`|zx5zzf53aa	To lose 5 pounds a week you have to do more than count calories and work out. I think a low carb diet is right for you. try to stay under 20 grams of carbs day. <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/atkins-diet-what-it-is" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/diet/atkins-diet-wh...</a>|`|N8cAwzxzaa	It's incredibly bad for you to be losing 5lbs a week. And at 5'2" your ideal weight is between 8.5 and 9 stone. 'At least 2 stone' takes you way under that. At 9 stone you'd be a British size 8/10 (US 4/6), which is perfect.<br>  <br>  You need to be coming out with 1500 calories per day, not 800-1000. If you carry on eating only that amount, and exercising, I can guarantee that by May you will be too ill to do anything, let alone go out partying for your birthday.<br>  <br>  If you go on your cross trainer for an hour 3 times a week, limit your calorie intake to 1500 and walk to and from school, you will lose 2/3 lbs a week, which is a healthy level of weight loss. 2/3 lbs a week loss will get you down to your ideal weight in a minimum of 7 weeks. BEFORE May.<br>  <br>  You must not go below 8.5 stone however. It's exciting to be losing weight but if you go too far your face will look gaunt, you will have terrible skin and feel like crap.<br>  <br>  While you are dieting drink lots of water. Tea is also good for you as it's an anti-oxident and will help your body flush out any rubbish.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to count drinks in with your calories. A bottle of Dr Pepper for example has nearly 300 calories. If you forget to count them you may not lose the weight you want to.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You can not lose 5 pounds a week. Maybe the first week,b ecause its all water weight and some fat from shocking your body into exercising, but afterwards it slows to 2 pounds at the most unless your starving yourself. Even then, only a puond or 2 a week. sometimes none. <br>  <br>  Lose weight hte right way. Then when your 18 going to prom you wont have to worry about your weight.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	If you want to lose weight, Quit drinking soda pop, even diet soda pop. Start drinking water. For breakfast, eat a bowl of Special K, Cheerios, or a dry Oatmeal cereal, with Skim Milk.<br>  For Lunch, eat a turkey sandwich, on wheat bread, and use mustard or fat free mayo.<br>  For Dinner, eat some type of lean meat, a can of vegetables, and some type of salad.<br>  Between meals, if you get hungry, drink water or eat some dry cereal.<br>  This and with the exercise you do, you will notice a difference in a couple of days. Good Luck

8CNUNQdwaa	Why are you masturbating at work anyway!!! Those kinds of things should be left in the privacy of your own home!! Totally Inappropriate.|`|KTp27Fokaa	No, I never get caught. I'm good like that.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	not yet......|`|T497f0iwaa	This is not a "women's health" question.   Please post these sorts of silly questions elsewhere.
loBIruvbaa	yes, like sleep medication if you take it for a long time and then stop, you may not be able to get to sleep but i don't know about other ones it could be.|`|utGddhnVaa	yes it can|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Dude,<br>  <br>  Prescription drug addiction is what killed Elvis Presley, Howard Hughes and many others, it also took Rush Limbaugh's hearing.<br>  <br>  So yeah, you can get every bit as addicted to those as you can smack.|`|djUMvICoaa	You can hide aches and pains under prescription drugs and that for the most part is what they are designed to do.  They never really fix anything, unless you are talking about the antibiotics, they usually mask pains until you don't feel them anymore.  Take them away and the pains return.  The question is what is causing the pain.  There isn't a pain that shouldn't be able to be removed from the body with the right help.|`|XUrgcOMDaa	It sure can.<br>  <br>  Bodies are naturally self-sustaining.  Your limbic system, which is a group of glands in your brain, controls everything from sexual and hunger impulses, to fear, thirst, anger, fear, pleasure, and numbness.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system#Function" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_syst...</a><br>  <br>  Our bodies can become dependent on any artificial chemical that is put into our bodies, because once a synthetic chemical is present, our bodies will stop producing the natural equivalent of the chemical.<br>  <br>  This is what happens when people who do drugs like heroin and cocaine try to quit.<br>  <br>  This is also what happens when people come off of anti-depressants... but anti-depressants are a different story, because it was a (natural?) chemical imbalance in the first place that caused the person to take the synthetic ones.<br>  <br>  The body can even become dependent on it's own natural chemicals.  You might have seen people that exercise incessantly?  It's the chemicals... the endorphins that they get.  Some people are truly addicted to sex... for the orgasm... the release of chemicals.  There are thrill-seekers.... for the adrenalin.  <br>  <br>  So yes.  By taking synthetic pain killers, it could be causing your body to stop producing natural chemicals (another form of endorphin).  Based on this alone, it would factor in that if you stopped taking the pain killers long enough, your body would start to produce endorphins again.<br>  <br>  However, I would still check with your doctor and make sure your knee is alright!|`|oG9FZ5hWaa	Yes, your body can depend on those and the physical withdrawals could be worse than you initial pain. I would try advil and seeing a physical therapist. You don't want to be addicted to pain killers...its a nightmare!|`|V5TC4x6jaa	Absolutely especially if it is a pain medication or sleeping pills.|`|2j2C44FDaa	It depends on what medication you are talking about. If something causes you to take it because of ill effects if you don't, means that yes you are dependent on that drug. That doesn't mean it is an addictive drug though. However without knowing more about the drug and what it was meant for in the first place it is not an easy question to answer. It could also be that your knee always hurts but you might not know about it, only if your other drug wears off. This might be the case with painkillers for example. Then the drug would have nothing to do with your knee hurting.|`|58e95a5bcb9b3b1cb28831601a8bb259aa	sure you can. They are still drugs but they are sold at the pharmacy and are legal. Legal does not mean they are safe it means some people are making a lot of money by selling them.
WPzaF2osaa	When you undergo any X ray procedure the best information can be obtained from the radiologist or from the Doctor who ordered the procedure. Following this path prevent the filtration of wrong or incomplete information that cause a lot of confusion in the patients. Nurses or x-ray techs should abstain from given any preliminary until the doctor reviews the result and confirm the findings. Believe me, I have been in similar situations and is embarrassing or upsetting to have a wrong reading from an ancillary personnel. Always look for the best source or who will give you the whole truth.
MmRDzhaHaa	I to have a curved spine, and had surgery and i to am in a lot of pain since i had it, and like you im thinking( it cos of you im in pain)when i think of the one who operated! i have just started to use a cane too, i feel older than i actually am,so i know how you are feeling, but ive been in pain for 25 years! i was offered more surgery but i refused well who can blame me,but im sure there is hope for you, do you lie down during the day to rest the pain away? you could try swimming to strengthen the back muscles, so that your back will be supported better! i was told to do this but i don't fancy swimming!  i hope you feel better soon, best wishes Blackcat.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	What was your original surgery for? Disk, slippage?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are carrying around a lot of anger with you.<br>  That will not help you to move on and do what you must to  find the help you need to either improve your situation or to learn to live with it.<br>  <br>  Have you gone to get another opinion about your current situation and pain? <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many people are in the same situation you are. Many of us live in daily pain due to past surgeries or to illnesses we were born with.  Sometimes we can find solutions to help lessen the pain, but other times it is about learning to accept our situation and deal with life as it is.  <br>  <br>  Part of acceptance is to drop the anger, accept that no matter how we got to this point, we are here now.  We have two choices, to make the best of it, or to live in anger and victim hood.<br>  <br>  Relying on pain meds for that long is really not a good thing.  This can cause multiple problems in addition to your existing pain.  It can even PREVENT you from getting relief from pain in the future when you need it.<br>  <br>  I would say the first step is to find a caring doctor that you can go to for advice about the past surgeries repercussions,  Who can tell you what your options are.<br>  <br>  But no matter what, get rid of the blame and anger, as it will only poison you further and cause you grief.
f8mLpPXlaa	It's called referred pain. Especially happens with stomach conditions. You might have gastritis or a small ulcer. Do what they said and get it looked at by a GI doctor.|`|5lNrIsFraa	Hiatal hernia could be the culprit.  I am a nurse and I have had patients that have had similar complaints before.  There could be many other things but that I think would be a common one.  I would just continue to follow up with your doctor and see what they come up with.  Hope you get to feeling better.
LzsCnwnFaa	Sweating means you probably have or had a fever and your body is trying to fight off the cold or infection by maintaining the right temperture. And you are lethargic because your immunity is low and all your energy is being put into keeping your body healthy. All that to say.... Sleep well and I hope you feel better soon!|`|mAp90hEeaa	Of course this is normal - you are probably running a fever.  You need to be taking some tylenol or ibuprofen (motrin/advil) on a regular basis, resting as much as possible because that is how your body heals itself; dramatically increasing your daily water intake, if you smoke - stop while you are ill, and run a humidifier in the bedroom where you sleep.  All will help until you are well again.|`|8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Cold lowers our body’s defenses and makes us feel fatigued. So fatigue and malaise is a common feature of cold.<br>  It is important to know if you are running temperature along with cold and taking Tylenol for it. One tends to sweat a lot when the body temperature is returning to normal after taking Tylenol.|`|aeVz0lrBaa	its not uncommon.  Sweating and tiredness are part of the bodies way of fighting infection.<br>  <br>  although as with everything , probably best to have a Doctor confirm what is wrong, should you still be unwell after a week or so.
CuVnpxh3aa	She will keep getting worse until she passes out and ends up in the hospital. If you don't have enough circulating blood you either can have a heart attack or pass out before that happens. She sounds a little anorexic in the fact that she knows she is under weight but is not eating foods to raise her iron levels or her weight. I bet she is also not eating much. No one can force her to do anything to get a transfusion but once she passes out call 911 and her Dr. They have to assume she wants help as long as she can't tell them differently but then the Dr would question why she doesn't want help when or if she is able to speak for herself. Just keep after her, maybe she will give in to get you to hush up. Good luck
1rcnc56Waa	Sounds like pregnancy, especially if your boobs hurt. If your 100% sure thats not the case could be hormonal, PCOD (if your gaining weight, an have a tad more facial hair then you would like)|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Sounds like pms to me.|`|vdPIWtNHaa	Hey listen have you ever thought that you may be about to have your period?

My first ejaculation was at age 11, and it was clear for about a year before it started to be white.|`|GB1f4sEEaa	I don't remember what my first load looked like, that has been so long ago but I would say that it is normal. The fluid that comes out is not all sperm, most of it is what's called seminal fluid.

You won't get sperm until they fully drop, and your voice begins to crack.|`|sCCjAKllaa	I'm pretty sure it is.

Y4s4Om38aa	Just give them the time to heal that you are supposed to.  8 weeks if i remeber correctly from mine.  Im assuming you are asking because of wanting to change the jewelery?   Though it never hurts to let them go longer then that.   I have had mine for over 2 years, and really still see no difference from how they were after a few weeks and now.  <br>  Only real difference is you dont have to be as careful about being in water with them like swimming, and having to take the care to clean them as often to prevent them from being infected.  Oh the one thing i did notice is early on if didnt do the salt water soaks or use saline swabs that i got that are for peircings for a couple days, they would start to get really sore.   That may have been them not being quite healed yet...was around 8 weeks think|`|1lTcxYWhaa	They may never heal. Once discharge stops and there is no pain with changing the jewelry, they have healed. But if you still have lymph fluid coming out and crusties, they likely pierced one of your milk ducts and it may never heal. I had mine for one year and nine months and the discharge never stopped. The discharge could also be a reaction to the type of jewelry.
piDDZ6Ywaa	It's swelling because lt is trying to fight off an infection, which is good. Then you won't need any antibiotics or such. But if lt's been swollen for that part, maybe go doctors and get it checked out.|`|1rcnc56Waa	Did you have a throat infection earlier? Dental infection? Ear Infection?<br>  <br>  Check the back of your throat in the mirror do you see a flat surface or more like a pocky ulcerated surface (suggests chronic pharingitis, in which case you would probably not have fever n throat pain- but you will have a lymph node aka "gland"

vyKVuYVmaa	Evercleanse is not a laxative.  Evercleanse provides sources of soluble fiber along with probiotics (healthy bacteria) that help support normal, healthy bowel function (regularity).  If a person is chronically constipated, and or has difficulty forming normal stools or struggles to move their bowels, Evercleanse can provide support for these issues.  There have been reports of individuals having accumulated, undigested matter in their colons.  This combined with the above mentioned issues can, once removed lead to a loss of weight.  The amount will vary.  We don’t suggest not incorporating exercise and a healthy eating plan along with other lifestyle changes.  We suggest Evercleanse as an addition to necessary changes in lifestyle in order for individuals to maximize the benefits of the program.  Evercleanse is a comprehensive cleaning/detox and wellness program that if used along with a healthy lifestyle incorporating the right foods, exercise and Evercleanse products will help you achieve your health goals, whatever they might be.|`|tOhsw07Yaa	The pattern for losing those extra pounds is not difficult - consume less and exercise more often - the difficulties appear when we actually try to put that into operation!

The only thing that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I worked off 25 pounds, it definitely does produce results!
iQOqj2KVaa	Sorry sorry for what your going through my friend. Honestly if your in a lot of pain the tooth is probably is infected and you will need to be on a antibiotic for a few days so they can remove the tooth comfortably for you , This will take the extreme pain away too.  I would call different local Dental offices to get quotes for a emergency exam and x-ray to start.  To have a tooth Surgically remove can be costly it ranges from $200. to $700+  it all depends if you need a Surgeon or if a general dentist is able to remove it. It costs less if you use only local anesthetic and not put Out by General Anesthetic. <br>  Costs vary from each dental office. I hoped this helped a bit. <br>  Please take care and know that most dental offices want you to be as pain free and comfortable as possible.|`|KyaAdqUpaa	I am not sure how much it would cost, but I have a suggestion to try and cut down the cost. Instead of going to a regular dentist's office see if you can find a dental hygienist school or orthodontists school near you. You would be overseen by at least 2 dentist and it would be a lot cheaper. A friend of mine went to dental hygienist school and you could go there a get a whole work up & cleaning for $20.00 and you were checked by a dentist. I am not sure if they will do oral surgery or not but it is worth a shot. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful but it is something you could look into. Good luck!!!|`|QjP2qtSnaa	You can try a low income health clinic.  Sometimes they have dentists or can refer you to one that offers a sliding scale.  Try this website <a href="http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/</a>  I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed at once.  It cost $1300, which included sedation.
WzKrZoHQaa	As medics they are bound by legislation to do everything in their power to keep that life.  However sometimes it is not just a case of whipping the heart out and putting in another - the theatres would be over-run and working on 24hr basis.  There is not enough Intensive equipment or even the beds - let alone the high level of staff req'd.  Then there are organs - we don't have by far enough and certainly not a reserve of them just hanging around waiting and many are not matches. It is just not possible.  Life and death are all part of the great circle of life.  The population needs to be kept in check - the food would be a huge issue and so in the end we make ourselves extinct - bad move.   Sorry it is just a natural process sad as it may be.|`|TsjqzanQaa	After death, the brain is starved for oxygen, and within minutes, the brain cells begin to die.<br>  <br>  After a couple of minutes, there's irreversible brain damage.<br>  <br>  And revival of someone has to take place within minutes, or else it's too late.      And it all depends on the other organ damage, such as liver, kidneys, pancreas, etc.<br>  <br>  It isn't that simple of just replacing the heart or restarting it.      It if were, then a lot of people wouldn't die and could be kept alive almost indefinitely.<br>  <br>  The human body is very complex, and there isn't any simple way of reviving individuals.|`|ZQjw9G6Oaa	well  its the brain shuting down and a blood match and the body acceptence to  new organ and the time it takes|`|9b0290b1dd64a25beeb14fe63183728caa	Apart from an existing shortage in human translpant organs, if this was possible where would the organs come from because we would be keeping everybody alive so nobody would want to donate because they would be expecting a new organ to replace their 'broken' one?  <br>  <br>  If this is possible, the technology has not been found to do it yet otherwise it would be going on all the time but would lead to mass over population.<br>  <br>  The only way i can think to compare is to a car (bear with me) sometimes all of the parts are too run down for the car to be fixed and road worthy merely by swapping one part.<br>  <br>  Humans, i suppose, are kinda the same.  Besides, a brain can only survive for three to five minutes without oxygen after which it quickly deteriorates and turns to mush making it useless as an organ.|`|AA11809403	if breathing has just stopped, CPR or shocking the heart may revive someone.<br>  <br>  Replacing a heart takes HOURS in surgery - too long, plus you would need a compatible heart.<br>  <br>  but it would be possible if someone was already in a hospital with great cardiology equipment, to put a "just des" person onto an artificial heart, hoping to replace it with in a few days.<br>  <br>  =====<br>  most docs don't try to revive/resuscitate after brain function stops UNLESS the person has been in freezing water.|`|0Sk5h2Mpaa	Yes,in certain circumstances,a heart attack or certain accidents,the heart can be restarted,unless they have been dead for too long.
2GdZSXC1aa	Increase your protein intake. Add foods such as peanut butter, whole milk and dairy foods such as cheese. I would exercise lightly for now, so as not to burn off more calories. If you do not start to gain weight over the next few weeks, see your Doctor again for a check-up and lab work.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Has your normal appetite returned yet? If you're eating normally again, the weight will come back on naturally anyway. Just eat slightly larger portions for a while.
Z8qBgv8taa	BDD and ED's usually go hand in hand. Sorry you were dealt such a lousy hand. With ED's just because you aren't acting on behaviors does not mean you are not having disordered thinking. That is where these illnesses lie. In our minds. The behaviors  come later. Much later. You need a support system that will encourage and listen and care for you. Feel free to contact me if you ever need a listening ear. Good luck
NK9Qc46Paa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|2eW4z4Hmaa	i got my acai info from here|`|w2zjDTxgaa	You should try an Appetite suppressant instead. for more details: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bx2lll" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/bx2lll</a>
6N47TXvsaa	To be honest with you, once upon a while I used to be strictly picky about the acnes I grow on my face. This was to the point that I would refuse to leave home for days until the acnes disappeared. But later I realized that I can have totally different perspective by recognizing my acnes as sort of cosmetics. i.e. something like tattoo. I sometimes wish I could have a vertical linear scar on my face that could represent a Samurai blade. Lol<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would take it easy and enjoy having my scars rather than perpetually suggesting myself that why I do have these.
Lfha91fsaa	this sounds oddly like a homework question
RQfLKOPQaa	Somebody described the symptoms, but one good description of the illness is: it feels just like it sounds. Nothing called that can feel good, it sounds like your body will disintegrate.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	it feels Terrible.  for a man, a green discharge from the penis, strong painful, urination.<br>  <br>  /jerome
1rcnc56Waa	The pain swelling is due to inflammatory reaction at the knee. Will take 2 - 3 days to die down and become a dull aching pain for a week or so. Probably become restricted for some time too. Best option is keep your mind off of it. Watch tv, watch friends, watch house, lost what ever. You will be suprised how well not thinking about it, improves it.<br>  <br>  Since I can't see the picture i realy have no idea where it is. <br>  <br>  As for other methods for stopping the pain, you could try this. Keep ice somewhere above your knee. It will sting your thighs at first. But you will see the pain won't be as visable at first in your knees. An soon starts going away. Try not keeping the ice over the knee since you want a good supply to the site to help reduce the inflammation faster.<br>  <br>  You could also take some anti-histamines and mild analgesic.  Cetirizine, and paracetamol 500mg (dolo)<br>  one pill of each Morning n evening after food|`|tSlWyoEPaa	I could see if it was just a regular scrape, but it seems really serious, I would definetly get to the doctors as soon as you can to see if you can get any help with that.|`|k0Om67JGaa	Go to the ER. Anytime you have any kind of discolored discharge, usually means infection. You will need anti biodtics.|`|Z5jt9mkKaa	STOP GOING DOWN ON UR KNEES. I KNOW ITS NOT FUN TO NOT BE A SLUT BUT IT SAVES  U FROM THE PAIN DUR TA DUR|`|FVkyxQjqaa	see a doctor|`|AA10139925	You probably haven't done any permanent damage, but with the way things are going it sure would do to have a doctor evaluate the injury for further infection, etc.  Usually something like this at a young age, is just tissue damage and obviously you will have some soreness and obvious bruising and those are the signs you are talking about which can and do cause a ton of pain because it's the knee caps and the fluid and bleeding under the skin and around the joint does go into the joint and that can cause aching, etc.  So, go to the doctor, have x-rays done of the knee area and have them evaluate the extent of your injuries and possible infection.|`|odu4jOx3aa	ok..ew.  just amputate that ****.<br>  if it's that bad you need to do something
VC7PyH53aa	Talk to your doctor. There's a drug called Diopan (sp?) that's controls<br>  that.

mh0QRDE9aa	You don't say how long you have been on the meds.  They do take time to work.  Maybe after 4 - 5 days, if you are not better, go back to the doctor for further testing.  If it is a pulled muscle,  it will take 2 - 3  weeks to heal.
Q4ggnG0waa	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a genetic condition involving the abnormal growth of blood vessels in some parts of the body which are particularly rich in blood vessels. It is caused by a flaw in one gene, the VHL gene, on the short arm of chromosome 3, which regulates cell growth.<br>  Medical care for people with von Hippel-Lindau disease depends on which tumors they have. Many tumors can be removed by surgery; some do not need to be removed unless they are causing symptoms (for example, a brain tumor pressing on part of the brain). Individuals with von Hippel-Lindau need to have complete physical examinations regularly, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain, abdomen, and kidneys to watch for new tumors. Eye examinations should also be done regularly, since eye tumors may develop.
AA10392637	Your breakfast will make you hungry sooner is is loaded with sugar, and a BLT with mayo is not a good selection for lunch.  A snack should be an apple or grapes and preferable no cheerios (which have a lot of sugar in them).  You dinner selection is great.  Do aerobics one  day with stretching afterwords and the next day do some lifting with weights.  If you do not have weights canned goods work just fine and add your sit ups and crunches on this day.  You want to alternate your days of aerobic activity and weights.  Stretching is very important when  you work out do it after you have warmed up your body. To be honest you are not overweight at all even if you are small bone.  It is okay for you to have a BLT at lunch, but your breakfast leaves a lot to be desired.  If you are trying to be healthy then just eat right and follow an exercise plan you can faithfully.|`|6wW7iLrbaa	First answer- since when is "whole grain" a dietary requirement? I bet you take yakult as well, don't believe everything you hear on TV. <br>  Chocolate sugar puffs are quite unhealthy they will drastically increase your blood glucose levels early in the morning which really isn't a good thing. As long as your BLT is on brown bread then that is fine- white bread is plain carbs which are quickly metabolised into fat. Your dinner is very healthy nobody can have an issue with that. However your exercise looks quite poor- doing low intensity work for an hour is boring, wastes time and it isn't very effective. Also seeing as your abdominals are quite a small muscle group it is not very efficient to only work out them. Work out your legs chest and back mainly if time is limited. I think you should try a tabata routine, it only takes four minutes but you will be completely tired after it. All it comprises of is exercising for 20 seconds then resting for 10- repeat this 8 times. The important thing is that each 20 second burst is at a maximum intensity. Try this with running, on a stationary bike or with squats. Finally you should eat 6 meals per day because giving  your body regular food increases the rate at which the food is broken down.|`|47790329901dba8887db0c7f8d7b4d1faa	Sounds good to me. For breakfast though, try to add whole wheat toast. And maybe for exercising try more cardio activities such as Tae Bo. Hmmm and BLT's I heard are not too healthy. Try a turkey sandwich instead.|`|JltE5LIHaa	Bit boteing eating that everyday. Try to vary it and loose the choco cereal too much sugar.|`|uUbiu131aa	i would say good for staying healthy and maintaining a healthy weight... if your weight isn't healthy then you will possibly lose some weight, but you should add some cardio if that is what you are going for.|`|zyxJFuFAaa	You need some whole grain in your diet. All bran, etc.....or brown bread.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	thats very good, its nice to see you treat your self with the sugar puffs, x|`|RW6YWEc2aa	it's good and all...but what is your goal?<br>  staying healthy?<br>  losing weight?<br>  or just having fun?

PBOWJYQ6aa	Do you like your job? How about your co-workers? The only way to address it is to change the way you see it, which is a hard thing to accomplish. In some ways it is harder to convince ourselves of a new viewpoint than other people. If there isn't a tangible issue that causes you to dislike work, you may be able to convince yourself that it is your favorite place to be. It seems silly, but if you tell yourself everyday that you are excited about the challenges the day holds, you can convince yourself of it. Try a rote memory technique. Find something that you like about it, even if it's the color of the wallpaper, and tell yourself a thousand times that you like that thing. "I love the purple wallpaper at work. I am going to see the pretty wallpaper at work. The wallpaper at work makes me feel serene." Give it a shot. It can't hurt- unless you go to work and lick the wallpaper and get sick. Good luck!|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	You just might not like that line of work. Try a new job. But, get the new Job before you quit your old one.  In the meantime, try to stay focused on what you have to do.

Stop worrying and anxiety, you will face everything boldly and nothing will happen to your health.|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	You panic before work and I don't want to assume, but you probally panic before doing other things as well.  I know how you feel.  Before the right medication that I am on, I would feel sick and worried.  It is tuff to suffer from social anxiety.  You might need something a little bit of "tweaking" in your meds.  It is great that you are going to cognitive therapy.  Stick it out.  I still to this day have anxiety, I have to show up before work ie.. appointments early to feel normal,  But what really is the deffintion of normal?  You will be fine.  My advise to you is to focous on something eles, maybe your breathing or picture yourself in a place that you love.  Anything to try and get your mind off the panic of going to work.

cSqx1DxKaa	Do you mean self-conscious?  I think a lot of women feel this way about their large chest.  They get in your way, they are heavy and can make your back hurt, you have to be careful of what type of shirt you wear so that you don't look obscene or tarty, and oh yes, you are probably far more to get your chest stared at by men than a small-chested woman is.  Most women don't particularly appreciate people talking to their boobs instead of their faces!|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	when i was a bit heavier, i was self conscious about my breast. i personally, do not like big breasts. as i lost the weight, i lost the breasts, and i actually feel more comfortable. for me, it was a bother for running and i felt people staring.<br>  i know other women who love having big breasts and it doesnt bother them.|`|Qa9pBa7aaa	well I am a 32-E and to be honest i don't feel that conscious -girls with smaller boobs look good too.And I really don't understand why women go to plastic surgery-whats the point having in my body jelly?

pjYQhPPBaa	Birth control pills are only pills with estrogen, no other chemicals (at least that I'm aware of). I'm sure it would be fine if you took BC with your UTI medication. On the BC pack and the UTI bottle it should say what medications you should/shouldn't be able to take them with.<br>  <br>  The doctor should have asked you if you were on any other medications. When they do, you should always mention you're on birth control because it can affect certain medications. If you're concerned, you should ask your doctor.|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	depends. please contact your doctor. with your pill packet, theres this huge form that gives you instructions plus further information for the pill. i know you cannot take stuff like tylenol/advil because of the ingredients. please contact your doctor and/or refer to your pamphlet.
5rJ6nf2oaa	Hemorrhoids don't turn into cancer, no. But your health status sounds to me like you are currently carrying an increased risk of developing colon cancer than you need to. This can change. You already know what to do. But the only way you are going to feel better about this for the moment is to go to your doctor and have some formal checks. Then you can put your mind to rest and concentrate on improving your health. By the way, if you change your diet and increase exercise you will find the hemorrhoids appear far less often and will be less troublesome. If you would like some help with cleansing your digestive system and starting a better diet I have added some links below about how to go about it. Best wishes.|`|AA10139925	Depending on your age, the only way to be sure is to have a colonoscopy and a rectal exam by a doctor.  But usually hemorrhoids are not a sign of cancer.  Hemorrhoids do not turn into cancer either.  That is why colon cancer is so hard to detect without an exam because it's another silent disease.  You can have no symptoms of colon cancer.  You can have  what they call a fissure which is a tear in the rectal tissue and that can bleed. Or you can have something called a blood filled sac caused from hemorrhoid tissue forming a blood clot like formation outside the anus and that is not cancer either.  Sometimes they can remove those but they usually don't bother you unless they become inflamed and sore.  Good for you to change your diet and that should help a great deal.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Not really.<br>  You have a lump? Where? Hemorrhoids can be a lump too!<br>  HOT TIP!!!  Put white zinc baby diaper creme on them twice a week.<br>  It makes them go away totally!!!|`|lEX3CjWlaa	There doesn't seem to be any association between hemorrhoids and colon cancer.<br>  <br>  There are treatments for hemorrhoids aside from diet that you may wish to talk to your doctor about. <br>  <br>  Check out: <a href="http://www.hemorrhoid.net/cancer.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hemorrhoid.net/cancer.php</a><br>  <br>  Hope this Helps|`|mAp90hEeaa	These do not usually become cancerous.  The poor diet/water intake can contribute to other problems within your bowel that eventually could become a cancer source but hemorrhoids are not a common cause of cancer.  You can go to WebMd and type in hemorrhoids and read up on the care and treatment of this condition and change the things you can change.|`|zHmZkMStaa	The short answer is no, they do not turn into cancer.  They do get larger and more painful as people age though, unless steps are taken to correct the problem.  Good luck.|`|bhZJqk4raa	Ok here's a serious answer<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor not the idiots on here|`|jJxUCkkFaa	consult your doctor!in person!
rQBbK6iEaa	You probably won't find an easy answer to that question. First, there are several different types of depression - and there will be different statistics for the ages at which the different types most frequently occur  for men. Also, some types of depression are chronic and reoccurring, meaning the depression may last the whole of the man's life, with cycles of him feeling depressed and then other times feeling okay. In those cases, you can only address the age of "onset", that is, when the first episode of depression occurred. You may want to choose only one type of depression for that paper.<br>  <br>  There is also some controversy about diagnosing depression in younger males. Many clinicians are reluctant to diagnoses the more severe depressive disorders in young men (under 21 or so). Also, in the past decade there has been increasing recognition that depression in young men often looks very different than the typical symptoms commonly associated with depression. In teens and young adults males, the symptoms of depression is likely to be expressed in aggressive behavior, rather than withdrawal or sadness. This means depression in men at these ages is often not diagnosed. <br>  <br>  The "athealth" page referenced below does have some further description of these issues and some statistics that may be helpful to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with the paper|`|f7PlvV4Baa	jus to let you know you really shouldnt use information you get here in a paper. u need to cite the source. look it up at the library or on the internet...<br>  it really is a form of cheating|`|c19bL0Iiaa	I was really depressed at around 23-25. Financial problems and drug problems. I'm 31 now and much happier that I took control of my life.|`|sm3hxXDSaa	Depression can happen in any stage of a man..provided there is a trauma like losing your job, girlfriend, status related to it.<br>  <br>  Depression most often hits men in the teenages btwn 17-20.

The breast tissue mussels go under your arm to your<br>  back so sometimes you can get what is called radiating pain.<br>  The best bet of relief is a heating pad or ice as every one is <br>  differant so try one if it does not help try the other. And you may<br>  want to ask the doc for a mussel relaxer like flexeral or cyclobenziprin<br>  but both are by perscription only so your doctor will be the one<br>  to priscribe meds. Also some times a hot shower may help.<br>  Best to you and hope the pain calms down.<br>  Carol
0Sk5h2Mpaa	No,HGH is only given to children who are severely stunted not for people who want to be a couple of inches taller because they think it would be nice.You still have a good few years yet to grow,you will probably grow another 2 or 3 inches.|`|7sMyItRDaa	short dudes do all right why do you want to screw up your body like that|`|7izZ17ncaa	yeah there is side effects you'll grow weird. and your bones will not work properly, because you're not allowing them to grow naturally.
wwRbkCMraa	Whey protein is a food product basically... so it's safe.  Being a female you definitely want to keep it on the light side.  I don't think you need more than about .5 gram per pound of body weight per day.  That means if you weigh 100 lbs the you would need 50 grams of protein for the whole day... whether via whey protein or other animal sources. <br>  <br>  Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.
ZW5GQFMhaa	i would advise you to go to the doctors but if you cant get an appointment for soon,then why not try a solution of alcohol and vinegar (sparingly). its what many older people say to use or go to your local pharmacy they have a liquid for your ear which should help|`|2QiLmXfhaa	you might have an infection or something...? go to the docs and get it checked out. Its prob nothing serious. <br>  <br>  It might just be like the left over from yr cold as well.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	hold your nose shut with your fingers,close your mouth and fill up your mouth with air until you feel a pressure in your ears and a little popping sensation(doesn't hurt).Then,let go of your nose and swallow a couple of times.That should clear your hearing.May not work the first couple of times.Keep trying.I got that trick from an ENT specialist.|`|3YJe5Z4Faa	Fluid behind the eardrum can occur after a viral infection.  It's typically not dangerous but it can be annoying.  Decongestants can be tried in an effort to unplug the Eustachian tube to speed up resolution but this doesn't always work.  Typically time does the trick.<br>  <br>  One question - did you have any discharge from the ear when you were ill?  If so, it's possible that you had an ear infection that perforated your eardrum.  In this case, the reason you can't hear is that your eardrum has a hole in it.  If you think this might be the case, be sure not to get any water in your ear (and don't put anything in the ear and don't pop your ears anymore) until you can get someone to take a peek in there with an otoscope.|`|DTAzCQlqaa	I suffered with this after a cold about 4 weeks ago.<br>  <br>  I went to my doctor and he explained its to do with pressure during your cold, just the same as when on an areoplane.<br>  <br>  There was nothing they can do - it should go within 5 weeks but if suddenly you get alot of pain you should go to your doctor as you may have an ear infection|`|rywmWJDoaa	Do you have sore throat? And if you are young like young teenager then probably there is a problem with your euthasian tube (the tube that connect the mouth to the ear) block. But don't worry it isn't anything serious. <br>  <br>  Do you have fever or ear pain? I would advise you to see your doctor or ENT doctor.|`|fHwGbsRMaa	Hold your nose and blow really hard out of ur nose. Just don't let go til you hear a pop noise.
kk8ypSTSaa	Hmm.... THings that will motivate me are my family , kids & friends. I want to be around long enough to create & share memories. For you who sounds like you are not really overweight & you  just want to be active, I say you need to start doing it . I think the more you do it, the more you will have fun and that will be motivation enough. For example... Get on a team or something with people your age. It will be a great source of networking as well as getting a little workout in. Do fun things like going to amusement parks. That is a lot of walking. For you I would say you do not really need to go to the gym all the time persay. Living an active life is best since you dont have much fat to burn. Go biking with some friends. Go to the beach and run around. Stay off the internet for too long. Dont be stuck in the house. DOing small things that keep you active when you are young will lead to great active healthy habits in adult life. Good luck.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Well... it's 14 weeks till the end of may to get a well fit body in check.. plenty of time.<br>  <br>  Umm.. i have to poop at 6:30am, then i can't go back to bed, and i dont leave to go to school till 10, so i've got 3.5 hours to kill... so i do high-intensity-interval-training (hiit)... and now im on yahoo answers... so yeah.|`|kiKB7tdaaa	Try something new . Haha, truthfully I'm not very motivated at all, I've just learned the art of making my mind go blank for an hour while I jog. Have you tried listening to music or playing a video game while exercising? If you're doing a sport, bring an I-pod, and if you have a tredmill, hook up a TV and a game in front of it any play while running.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i treat myself after my session to something i love doing like having a nap or going to the cinema or going shopping. I also use music to motivate me when i am at the gym to keep me going. I like the gym because if i get bored from one machine i can easily go on to another one xx|`|RW6YWEc2aa	IWannaBeSkinnyIWannaBeSkinnyIWannaBeSkin...|`|dAcNaajsaa	sorry can't help you|`|AA11988490	looking at myself in the mirror is pretty good motivation! Plus wanting to fit back in my "skinny jeans". Also, I remember how good I feel when I do workout.<br>  There are days when I don't want to do anything at all, because I worked all day, then I had to go to the grocery store, then run the kid to swim practice. But I still make time because if I don't, then the next morning I always hate myself for not working out. Even if its just 25 minutes of exercise, it still makes a difference.|`|FVhvys3iaa	The two things that are currently motivating me, aside from overall fitness and well-being...goals and fun.  For example, I am currently training with the couch-to-5k (c-2-5k) program because I am determined to run a 5k in the spring/summer.  I've never been a runner but having lost a considerable amount of weight, now is the time to do it and I am very determined to make this happen!  I use a calendar to chart my progress and it's cool to see how far I've come along.<br>  <br>  Fun: I am also enrolled in a belly dancing class.  Great workout and I LOVE it!  My instructor is fantastic--not technical at all and makes us all feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  I guess motivation will depend on what you want to get out of exercise--fitness, weight loss, etc.  Despite your reason, my advice is to make goals for yourself, whether it's to lose a certain amount of weight, run for x amount of time, etc., and to find things you enjoy doing.  Trying taking a class (alone or with a friend) such as a dance class, pilates, yoga...or joining a team sport--like volleyball or softball.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.  Have fun and get moving!  :)|`|47790329901dba8887db0c7f8d7b4d1faa	I don't want to be fat and die of PREVENTABLE diseases such as Diabetes, High Blood Pressure and the like (did that motivate u? :D). I content with how I am.<br>  <br>  Also, I like the way i feel afterward. I do Tae Bo and Belly Dancing.|`|JltE5LIHaa	I take my dogs for long walks and I ride my horse so dealing with all those things associated with him help|`|JoyAPIGeaa	I used to google for things to motivate me just before I'd run.. even rocky on youtube lol :) but once you get into it, other things motivate you like how your body looks and how healthy you are by comparison to your former self and how you feel just after you completed the exercise etc.  the activities I like are running and strength training mainly because they're free :p<br>  also, perhaps you could plan to work out a while before your favourite tv show and reward yourself by watching it (post shower of course)<br>  <br>  for getting off the couch, there's a c25k beginners running program which might get your fitness level back up <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/...</a>  << half way down the page<br>  <br>  yeah that makes sense, I went through a period of just sitting around doing next to nothing and it took me a while to get into running (I chose running because it's something I can do without having to rely on a gym as I found it harder to motivate myself to go there than I did to do the exercise). I had a few stop/starts before I really got into it and I used that couch to 5k plan which builds you up slowly and you can see fitness improvements every single time you run.

AA11020187	Cancer cannot be diagnosed through a blood test and blood work is often in the normal range when a person has cancer. You state her cholesterol was a little, but she is okay, but she isn’t okay.<br>  <br>  These are not typical symptoms of cancer, but they are symptoms of heart disease. They often come and go and people explain them away when in fact it is a warning sign. Taking aspirin when you are having symptoms of a heart attack can help keep it at bay and that may be why the doctor recommended it, but she needs to be followed up. You should also be aware that women with heart disease often present with varied symptoms and are not classic like they are in men, for this reason it is often over looked even in emergency rooms. She needs to be very diligent in getting to the bottom of this.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Routine blood tests don't usually include a cancer check unless the doctor has asked for it specifically.

yvdxzQDsaa	it may be the water u r using for shower <br>  u can buy a shampoo for the hair loss <br>  but also visit a doctor|`|TCpTlCTRaa	The type of hair loss that causes excessive shedding is called telogen effluvium. This type of hair loss is usually temporary and reversible. Any type of physical or emotional imbalance can cause this type of hair loss. The hair will usually begin to shed 1-3 months after the disturbance is perceived. It could be medication, vaccination or flu shot, change in diet, stress, infection, low ferritin levels, etc. or any type of health imbalance. Telogen effluvium is often temporary and reversible. If the body does not adjust quickly it can become more severe and long-lasting. Chronic telogen effluvium may develop. <br>  Essential oil scalp massage are a wonderful, effective remedy to stimulate new hair growth in this type of hair loss.|`|PhTKb3JUaa	I have thick hair too.

However, if it balds in one spot, it's a stress problem you should address.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i would see a doc and ask.  hair loss is probably oneof those things that could indicate some health problems.  also, some medications can cause hair loss.|`|3zm0jA0yaa	People usually lose 70 to 90 hairs per day anyway, so you are not to worry about that amount. If I were you I'd get some vitamins especially meant for hair growth. My hair did the same thing but its because i was going thru menopause. It could be the type of medication you are taking or just a period of natural hair loss. If you are finding little hair growing back in around your hair line don't worry. at least it is growing back, but I know how all alarming it can be to see all those hairs in the shower and on the brush. I am still doing that but am growing new hair in. Go to the natural food store in your town, speak to the owner preferably she or he knows more about things, and tell them what is going on with your hair. They should recommendnd some hair nutrients and vitamins which will help your hair to grow. Good luck and don't worry too much. That will make you loose hair too. lol|`|AA12198724	You really need to seek a doctor or dermatologist. You may have too much DHT in your scalp.<br>  Or you may be using too many chemicals in your hair and its dying off. I recommend products like doo gro or dr. miracles if you cant afford other natural products. Like avoid shampoos and stuff with Alcohol, Lanolin and Petrolatum (or petroleum) because they dry the hair and clog the scalp. You should deep condition your hair though with natural ingredients (like 11 in 1 or whale,sheep or goat sperm as a last resort.) Look online you can make your own deep conditioning formula from like coconut and stuff so check that out. If you go to the archives on here there are some more better homeopathic suggestions. But visit your dermatologist first because it may be underlying for something else (stress). I think maybe your scalp is just dry and overworked with chemicals but i dont have a MD so you should visit him or her and see whats going on. Also are you eating a lot of junk food because that can be a big factor. Try to eat more fresh food because the chemicals in junk food can be bad for your body and hair.|`|vtTpUCNfaa	I don't know how old you are but around 37 I started losing my hair like crazy.

I went in to have some testing done only to find out I was having some issues with my thyroid. The doctor started me on T3 and my hair stopped falling out. Now..it could be some vitamin you are lacking in your body. My mother use to lose alot of hair and bought Biotene shampoo and conditioner at a locat vitamin store which helped her alot.

CuVnpxh3aa	I think the Dr will check your thyroid and your sugar. You have symptoms of both problems. I know the Dr will find out your problem(s) so don't worry. These problems are not caused from low blood pressure. You may be anemic but that would not cause all your problems. These are also not the symptoms of high blood pressure. Normal BP is 120/80, yours is only 100/60, not too high. Mine runs 90/60 and I don't have your symptoms, they sound more like anemia or low blood sugar and possibly both. Let us know. Good luck|`|xt6bhqDPaa	Hi there, <br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about your symptoms.?<br>  <br>  From the symptoms you've described, I can tell you that they closely match those of somebody who has high blood pressure...<br>  <br>  ?...almost exactly in fact.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of things that you can do to lower your blood pressure (and generally protect your heart), such as making small changes to your diet, and getting more exercise.<br>  <br>  The problem with high blood pressure is that many people will do everything their doctor will tell them, and therefore continue to take whatever pill or prescription drug that is scrawled onto paper.<br>  <br>  Whilst certain pharmaceutical drugs show promise (I even recommend certain over the counter ones), the truth is that you can lower your blood pressure naturally simply by taking proven steps in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Note: See the end of this post for a resource which provides the full daily plan to reduce your blood pressure, after reading these tips... <br>   <br>  The problem with many prescription drugs designed to treat high blood pressure, is that they merely deal with the symptoms (not the cause).<br>  <br>  This is true for many types of drugs, so it's no wonder that natural ways to lower your blood pressure are becoming more common place these days.<br>  <br>  Plus, many low blood pressure drugs have many side effects such as nausea, headache, and some can even cause aneurysms. Certain medications can damage your internal organs, and cause your cholesterol levels to rise...not good.<br>   <br>  So, I've come up with 6 ways for you to take the first step to naturally lowering your blood pressure without using costly prescriptions:<br>   <br>  1. Add certain foods to your diet. Foods containing magnesium and potassium are super effective for reducing hypertension. Some of these foods include bananas, potatoes, chocolate and beans. Garlic and Vitaimin C are also great for the heart, and anything with Omega 3 will help (sardines are a great example).<br>  <br>  2. Exercise. You don't have to exercise like a nut, but even as little as 10 or 15 minutes per day of light exercise like walking can help significantly lower your blood pressure.<br>  <br>  3. Reduce Stress. If you are stressed out, this can cause your blood pressure to rise, and without you knowing it. Try yoga, deep breathing and meditation to help lower your stress levels and blood pressure.<br>  <br>  4. Reduce sodium in your diet. Salt levels can affect the heart and dehydrate the body. This will damage your heart over time and can lead to high blood pressure over a longer period of time. Avoid ready made meals, as they are high is salt levels (because they taste bad!)...and try to tone it down on the seasoning if you can.<br>  <br>  5. Stop smoking, and avoid excessive alcohol. You know you shouldn't eat much salt if you have hypertension, but you should also reduce alcohol intake to 1 or 2 ounces per day. Stop smoking if you do.<br>   <br>  6. Add herbs. Herbal ingredients are wonderful for maintaining normal blood pressure, and do treat the underlying cause. Herbs also don't have the risky side effects that some medications do.<br>   <br>  These are a few things you can do to lower your blood pressure naturally. Taking an active role in your health can improve your overall health and even add years to your life.<br>   <br>  If you take prescription medications, consider switching. Why poison your own body with synthetic and potentially harmful substances when there are natural ways to lower your blood pressure that work better?<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you, and you get better soon! For your reference, I've also added a link at the bottom of this answer to a blog that offers more advice...<br>  <br>  ...and you'll learn more about hypertension, what it is and how to stop it in its tracks naturally and quickly! <br>  ?|`|DL5vxzBHaa	Sorry to know you've been feeling so unwell  and it's good to know you have an appointment booked to see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers is not really the place to discuss your symptoms, as people could offer you all sorts of suggestions which will make you feel more worried.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will go through your symptoms and history and may send you for blood tests to try and find out what's going on.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you soon feel better :-)

Tonsillitis is an inflammation or infection of the tonsils.

If those droplets come into contact with your mouth, eyes, or nose, you can become infected. (Logically, it would also spread by kissing or any other mouth-to-mouth contact, like CPR.) <br>  <br>  However, it may in rare cases be caused by a parasite or fungus.|`|3YJe5Z4Faa	Tonsillitis caused by a virus is contagious just as any viral cold/flu would be.

THIS IS SERIOUS, therefore if it seems to be moveing and/or pushing out then you may have a problem.. if you go to a dr they will just say take it out... so it would be best to go to the place where you had it done.<br>  <br>  If you cant go there then just take it out for a few days, keep it clean ect.<br>  <br>  Then when it looks less red and crusty then put it back in.
67jA9Wb7aa	You're body naturally produces creatine and dhea. Rather than consuming them, which will actually create a dependency on them, try to naturally raise those levels. It is funny that you said besides food, because the best way to gain lean weight is eating the correct food. Eating 5 meals a day about 600 calories each evenly spread through the day is a good way to increase your metabolism and increase creatine levels in your body. Eat plenty of complex carbohydrates, and remember to include fiber in your diet. Avoid sugar and empty calories, your body needs plenty of vitamins and minerals especially working out. Don't be afraid to eat plenty of fat, but get it from unsaturated fat. And of course eat plenty of protein. Eggs are an excellent source and so are beans and chicken. And contrary to wait you might hear raw eggs are not better for you than cooked, in fact raw eggs are less readily absorbed into the body and it robs the body of biotin. Also all these over the counter ****, has alot of ingredients in it that are either unnecessary or unhealthy, and an intoxicated body will not develop properly. But diet aside, the most important thing is your workouts. I could give you more tips on that if you like but it seems like you know what you're doing. Testosterone is what you want to increase, hence its your growth hormone, the best way to do that is high weight and large muscle groups, so try squats. The only products I will recommend using is arginine, whey protein, glucosamine, any anti inflammatory, and green tea supplements. I guess the most important thing though is: patience.<br>  <br>  Just wanted to add that, what comes fast goes fast.|`|uUbiu131aa	well, ive never answered a question about gaining weight... but im guessing that you want to gain muscle...  my dad is a ex wwf wrestler, so i kinda know a bit about this stuff<br>  <br>  you eventually will beable to gain 15 in muscle but it may take a while.. the suplements and vitamins will help but not very much..its mostly just in the workout.. sorry to say..<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a bit of chunk(extra weight) then you may lose some after gaining some muscle..<br>  <br>  But just stay deddicated to your workout.. if you can get a trainer, it may cost a bit extra but it will be well worth it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

EMbaak9waa	Maybe your body can't handle meat.<br>  Get a test done to see if this is the case.<br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|FKqtAhjraa	My friends and I have had trouble with this and we just avoided meat for awhile. We think it has something to do with the rise and fall of hormone levels.|`|djUMvICoaa	You may be having some reaction to meet.  Have you tried giving it up for a while to see if things clear up?  If it would then you might have to look at replacing meat with other things to get your protein, like cheeses, nuts etc.  Have you laid on a bed and pushed your fingers into the area that hurts?  Try it right under your ribs.  If it is painful stop where it's tolerable and hold for about 20 seconds, if it goes away, push a little deeper, repeating what you have done.   I do this through my whole stomach area and it makes me feel better, but sometimes there are areas that are really sore but not after doing this.  lots of luck|`|yiUNN8ADaa	Stop eating meat=No more nausea! :)

Also, if you keep washing and washing, the skin produces more to protect itself as well. So don't wash your skin so much, twice a day is plenty, and using the products you mentioned the same, twice a day for toner. Exfoliate much less than that - once or twice a week tops. Don't overdo it.  Meanwhile you can just blot when it gets to be noticeable, there are blotter sheets you can buy or just use a good old fashioned Kleenex.
Rwf8D5toaa	Losing your virginity just for the sake of losing would be a mistake. Don't be embarrassed by it; too many young women are not picky enough about their sexual partners. (And I bet you've seen plenty of proof of that!)<br>  <br>  When you have sex, do it because you want to do it and after you have thought it through carefully. Don't do it just because everyone else is, and don't do it just because you're drunk. Make sure it's a guy you can trust, and that you're both prepared.<br>  <br>  Don't do it because you think it's the only way to get or keep a guy, either. Any guy who is only interested in you if you'll have sex with him seriously isn't worth the trouble!<br>  <br>  I have many friends, male and female, who have chosen to wait to have sex, even until marriage in their late twenties in some cases. None of them have regretted it. (And they didn't sit at home without dates throughout college, either.)<br>  <br>  I've had other friends, again male and female, who did have sex just so they wouldn't be virgins anymore. Most of them regret their decision, and usually their choice of a first partner, too.<br>  <br>  I always liked Cher's line from Clueless: "You see how picky I am about my shoes and they only go on my feet!"|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Guys will stick in anything.

As long as it is not severely deep (which is unlikly unless put a lot of force on it), and not right on a joint where moving the fingers would continually break it open, it should be fine.  Clean it, and then just hold paper towels on it putting some pressure on it.  Should stop bleeding.  Dont keep trying to clean any other blood off the skin right now as that will make it keep bleeding as you will be cleaning off the blood that is clotting.

pjYQhPPBaa	Sounds like TMJ or an ear infections. First you have to determine where exactly the pain is coming from. Is it coming from the ear then going to the jaw, or coming from the jaw then going to the ear?.<br>  <br>  Does your jaw lock or pop? That had been happening to me for years, until recently when it really started actually hurting. I noticed that it starts in the jaw and goes to the ear, rather than the other way around. I spoke with my dentist about it (though I haven't seen him because I'm at college) and he said it sounds exactly like TMJ.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is go to the doctor to determine if it's an ear infection or not. If not, then talk to your dentist about it. However, he'll most likely tell you it's from grinding your teeth (which you might unknowingly do in your sleep) and that you need to wear a night guard for a while to fix it.|`|1rcnc56Waa	Most likely Middle Ear Infection with referred pain through Chordae Tympania (nerve that travels through your ear and supplies your tounge)<br>  <br>  You should also feel slight warmth in your ear, a sense of slight hearing loss also|`|B68rQSjoaa	you have a ear ache take some olive oil warm it up and put it in your ear|`|AA10720479	ear infection|`|xshrKvIRaa	You may have TMJ disorder or you could have a sinus infection that is draining.

3YJe5Z4Faa	What you're describing strongly suggests the presence of a seizure disorder.  Not all seizures are the kind where people fall to the ground convulsing... those kinds are called generalized clonic-tonic seizures.  There are other types of seizures, one of which is called petit mal seizures, where the victim will simply "space out" for a few seconds to a minute and not recall anything of what happened during the time of the seizure.  During this time, the victim is entirely unresponsive - even to a pin in the finger.  Afterwards, the victim has no recollection of what happened during the time they were "spaced out".<br>  <br>  Some people will even get "auras" - odd sensations that they come to associate with the seizure coming on - auras can be sounds, smells, visual disurbances, a sense of deja vu, or even something indescribable.<br>  <br>  These types of seizures are often mislabelled daydreaming or laziness before the correct diagnosis is found.<br>  <br>  Kindly do the following,<br>  1.  Do not drive or operate machinery or do anything (e.g. climb heights or swim alone) which might be dangerous if you had another one of these spells.<br>  2.  See a doctor and ask if they think this might be seizure disorder.  A referral to a neurologist may be in order.  If it IS seizure disorder, there are a number of medications that can help.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|V3rz6G6yaa	Go to the hospital ASAP.

rQBbK6iEaa	Hi Amanda,<br>  <br>  I won't speculate on what is occurring for you, but I would strongly encourage you to take steps to find out. What you're describing is serious enough that figuring our what's going on is important. If one of my clients told me of these symptoms I would immediately refer them for a medical assessment. First, there are some situations where spacing out to that degree can potentially be dangerous for you. Second, with that occurring it's possible for you to start becoming more and more anxious - worrying about when it might happen next. Third, it's affecting your quality of life - like you said, you miss out on things that you were excited about. Fourth, there may be a medical or neurological issue going on (possibly epilepsy seizures) that can be treated, but probably won't go away on their own. The site referenced below gives descriptions of some type of epilepsy seizures, although PLEASE don't assume that is what is going on.. let a medical professional help you find out for sure what is happening.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck,<br>  Geoffrey|`|Ia1ddgSCaa	I get it and my doc calls it dissociation, I have a dissociative disorder.  <br>  <br>  It may not be epilepsy, so don't panic.<br>  <br>  Both can be treated with medication anyway.<br>  <br>  Go see your doctor and tell him.|`|y4XOGjPPaa	You sound like you are having mini seizures which can last a couple of seconds.

9iXGakohaa	It's most likely from the food you are eating. Food particles can get all over your mouth and cause minuscule scratches. Are you eating lots of chips, or something with a similar texture? That would definitely cause it. <br>  <br>  You may also want to buy a new toothbrush. It could be aggravating or even causing the scratches if it isn't a soft bristled or is too old.<br>  <br>  Talk to your dentist, there are easy solutions that they can provide you with for covering the raw wounds and preventing them.

XWPOUafmaa	There are many dietary sources of potassium, especially fruits, vegetables and meats, so it is very likely you ingested at least some potassium. <br>  <br>  It is unlikely you will have a deficiency due to diet from one week of poorer than average diet, especially when hypokalemia caused by insufficient consumption of potassium is quite rare, even more so in first world countries. <br>  Maintain a healthy balanced diet.<br>  <br>  If you are specifically concerned about potassium deficiency, I recommend eating bananas.<br>  <br>  Depending on how much water you drank over the period of time (5 to 6 litres over a day is fine), and how you are replacing your electrolytes, you may be better off being concerned about water intake and replacing electrolytes, including potassium, rather than focusing on having hypokalemia.<br>  <br>  If symptoms persist, see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1qKvCldEaa	Sounds like a potassium deficiency. Muscles need potassium in order to contract. It might not be calcium because calcium stores in bones. Potassium doesn't really have a storage facility aside from muscles. It would explain the muscle aches/weakness/and headaches (brain uses a process similar to muscles to cause neurons to fire). Diarrhea though I'm not so sure, that could just have something to do with excess amounts of water being absorbed into your feces to relieve your bladder.<br>  <br>  P.S. be careful if you use bananas for your potassium, you can't bank it up in one day, it takes a week for your body to accommodate. Eating over 5 bananas in a day can make you constipated. If after 3 days symptoms persist, call your doctor and have some blood work done.|`|IBFlHjsdaa	Very possible. Very easily diagnosed and very easily treated.<br>  <br>  Eat some bananas. No joking! Bananas contain potassium.|`|Get4HnNKaa	yes. eat more tomatoes|`|RvddYKqjaa	Potassium deficiency can cause serious problems, including heart trouble. Don't play around with it, if that's what it is. Get a supplement and start taking it, then make sure your diet has foods rich in potassium, like bananas and oranges. There is no way we can know for sure if you have a deficiency without a blood test.|`|sTdlAMv7aa	As others have said, electrolytes like potassium are vital & dangerous to manipulate.  To put liters into a familiar frame of reference, 3.78 liters = 1 gallon.  The recommended intake of water for a 2000 calorie diet (which would have sufficient potassium sources) is 1 gallon.  So you had 1/3 to 1/2 a gallon more than necessary without proportionally increasing potassium.  That could account for your headache, muscle aches & weakness, & diarrhea.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like a potassium deficiency/water intoxication.  Make sure to get enough electrolytes, as one can die from such imbalances (such as Jennifer Strange, who participated in a competition called "Hold Your Wee for a Wii" & died from consuming too much water [<a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/8849/1092/" rel="nofollow">http://www.itwire.com/content/view/8849/...</a> ], & bodybuilder Mohammed Benazziza, who died from taking excessive diuretics).
tcvQwTa5aa	get a flashlight and have someone(parent or whatever)look at your tonsils.If they look really bad or have white spots on them,you could have strep,and that requires prescribed medication.Take some alkaseltzer plus cold.It works wonders for me.You don't have to use the kind you put in water,they come in capsule form,too.It works really good.I recommend it to anyone.|`|rInv89Xnaa	Save your money. you either have the common cold or strep .|`|lQwKS5VLaa	i dont have allergies so i dont know how severe it can get but your symptoms dont generally point to one diagnosis thier just all over the place. you should probably think about going to the doctor if you can. you might have tonsillitis :o

piDDZ6Ywaa	Okay, lf you mean Marie died of cancer, do you mean skin cancer? Skin cancer is caused by overexposure of UV radiation light.<br>  <br>  In common usage, "radiation" is synonymous with ionizing radiation. It refers to any radiation process in which the individual quanta of radiated energy are able to ionize atoms or molecules of the substance in which the energy is absorbed. This leads to chemical changes that can damage biological tissues and structural materials.<br>  <br>  Sources of ionizing radiation include most nuclear processes (e.g., nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, radioactive decay), X-ray equipment, high-energy physics experiments, and cosmic radiation.|`|oNQydySCaa	Radiation is, in layman's terms, a stream of angry words that cells can hear. When the cells hear this and start to weep uncontrollably, the cellular "tears" form into a solid mass that we in the aeronautical industry call "tumors".<br>  <br>  To counteract this, you need to play a louder stream of words that can embolden your body's natural ego. We in the horticulture industry call this "chemotherapy".

6NZeItMAaa	Many people just stop eating or they eat only one meal a day, thinking they will just cut out all the calories. DON’T DO THAT!<br>  <br>  When you deprive your body of food, your body will react and go into survival mode, taking what it needs from wherever it can. That can lead to very serious consequences! It can put you in the hospital, or worse, the morgue!<br>  <br>  One suggestion is to SLOWLY cut back on what you eat. Instead of 3 spoonfuls of food, cut back to 2.<br>  <br>  The key is to not send a message to your brain that you are starving. And yes, there is a difference between feeling hungry versus starving!<br>  <br>  It will take some time to train your stomach and your brain on your new routine. Just please do not rush it … Remember: Small Steps!|`|t81MEJ82aa	It doesn't work like that. Eventually you'll starve the weight off but your body does not work like a car.

rcPnnfmmaa	Have you ever tried to sunburn the bottoms of your feet? Even in the age of poolside lounge chairs this is difficult. The skin is thicker in both these places and almost always in the shade.<br>  <br>  People who live in tropical climates are highly pigmented to prevent skin cancer. They can still burn but less permanent damage is done when they do.<br>  <br>  White skin is an adaptation for greater transparency. You may not be aware of it but humans photosynthesize. We're not like plants; we're set up to do something very different from what plants do and it's not a logical way for a creature that burns as much energy as we do to try to feed itself anyway. In sunlight we make vitamin D, and before the advent of fortified foods people with dark skin who tried to live in northern climates often developed crippling vitamin D deficiencies. White people can develop vitamin D deficiencies too; in places like London during the industrial revolution the sky was so dark and smoggy, clothing so thick, and food was so low quality that a disease called bow-legs or rickets was extremely common.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D</a>|`|sXVkRGJIaa	I dunno but I dont think this question should be in the 'skin conditions' category !|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Why do some people have blonde hair and others have brown hair?

For your scenario, I don't think the response would be common, and you'd have to create specific circumstances and back story to lead to the response you want to describe.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I was only referring above to the cases that go unreported, not like the person above who was greatly traumatized.

A7tCRFuJaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I think you are dealing with two different problems here. Premature ejaculation is probably the underlying problem which because it has not been treated has also manifested itself as impotence. <br>  <br>  Drugs like Viagra do work in some circumstances but are you sure this is the road you want to go down as there could be harmful side effects. Have you looked at what could be causing the problem in the first place as there may be a much easier solution that does not need your husband to take drugs.<br>  <br>  You have made the first step towards a solution by asking the question but take your time and read up on causes and cures before you commit to something as strong as Viagra.<br>  <br>  There is further information on natural cures in this blog|`|3jjOpK0aaa	You could try viagra but I will tell ya what,  that stuff sucks.  The side effects are terrible.  Have you ever tried a sexual enhancer?  I was in your situation,  like  I said,  viagra was tried but it wasn't for me considering the side effects overwhelm the pleasures of it.  I found this natural herbal enhancer and figured what the heck,  if it's natural it must be great and plus it said no side effects.  I tried it and after about two days of taking it I was just horny like a mad man.  All the time,  I have erections that want to stand straight up and the orgasms are to die for.  The stuff was called vigrx plus and I saved on it at the time at <a href="http://hughs-reviews.com," rel="nofollow">http://hughs-reviews.com,</a>   You should check it out.  I love the fact it's made from a researched blend of herbs that seem to do the trick for me atleast.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	Two seperate situations.<br>  <br>  E.D. erectile dysfunction. unable to obtain or maintain an erection.<br>  <br>  premature ejaculation - "cùmming", ejaculating semenial fluid too fast before or too soon during sexual intercourse.<br>  <br>  for the E.D. take some STIFF NIGHTS.<br>  <br>  For the premature ejaculation - have him to learn Multiple Male Orgasms techniques.<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|H2IqzG12aa	ED usually refers to an inability to get or maintain an erection.  Premature ejaculation is another condition entirely, the one you describe with your husband.<br>  <br>  If he ejaculates early, he probably hasn't reached a point when he would experience an orgasm.  There are creams and lubricants available that contain a mild local anesthetic such as nupercaine that reduce sexual sensitivity so that the experience takes longer.  That may or may not help in your case.  Often premature ejaculation is a learned response, one that can also be unlearned.  You might want to consult a urologist or a professional sex therapist for advice.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	No, ED and premature ejaculation are not that same; HOWEVER, premature ejaculation can have a psychological effect on getting erections.  Erections are caused by blood flow into the corporal bodies (think tubes) that make up the penis.  If the blood flow is not adequate (sometimes due to diabetes, hypertension, medications, etc.) erections are too soft for intercourse or not existent.  Premature ejaculation is the inability to hold back an orgasm.  Orgasms can happen without ejaculation, however.  Something like Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra may be helpful for the premature ejaculation as well because it acts as an "insurance policy" giving the man reassurance that he will be able to maintain an erection for intercourse.  There are techniques to try for premature ejaculation such as holding the base of the penis when he believes he is going to orgasm; slowing down the rhythm of intercourse; less foreplay for him or more foreplay for you.  He should see a urologist for a more complete assessment.  He may have a slight infection in the prostate or even some psychological issues that need to be addressed as well.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Please try viagra...im not sure how they work because me and my husband are still young and dont have this problem but hopefully something will help because i dont see how he penatrates you if he isnt erect.|`|sCCjAKllaa	It seems like it.

How long has this been going on? <br>  <br>  What I'm trying to get at, is whether or not it's a response from a bad experience in the past (i.e. psychological) or perhaps it's some sort of reaction to the chemicals released during sex/orgasm...|`|bHcxSUwtaa	Ooohh.. :| go to the doctors|`|1lTcxYWhaa	This will sound odd but it's worth a shot.

PBOWJYQ6aa	No I don't think you will lose the job. I think they will look on it favorably because you are handling it responsibly, seeking treatment for it, and taking care of it. They will just ask you if the stress of the job is too much for you, and if you would prefer a different assignment. The answer to that is clearly "no" since it sounds like you really like your job or you wouldn't be this worried about it. Just tell them everything you told us, and it will be fine.|`|BTTFVbYYaa	just say its mild if they are decant people they will respect your honesty.
gPlUDaRoaa	Well all you can do is go see your doctor and tell him/her whats going on with you and how horrible your cramps and anxiety are during that time of the month for you.With the way people are abusing pain meds these days chances are they wont give you anything really strong like vicodin.Especially if you haven't been in to the doctor before regarding this problem your having.All you an do is ask right?Good luck.|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	probably not. you cant just go in there and ask for vicodin or somas and think that you will just get them.

Especially if you ask for them.  Narcotics are very hard to get prescribed now since the DEA is cracking down on them so much.  He'll probably give you something a little more powerful but you aren't going to get vicodin.
iAv9P3HTaa	1. Check your diet. If you are not eating a balanced diet, your entire body will be affected, and your hair is a part of your body. Certain proteins, minerals, and oils are critical for normal hair health.<br>  <br>  2. Check your stress levels. Anxiety and stress are common causes of hair loss. Some stress cannot be avoided, but you can take steps to reduce their affect on your body. One of these is regular exercise. As well, you need to develop relaxation techniques, such as breathing therapy, Yoga, or meditation. Whatever works for you, increase it!<br>  <br>  3. Hair loss can be a symptom of a disease – Lupus and Diabetes are two common causes. When hair loss appears to have no other cause, you need to check with your doctor. Diabetes and Lupus are more dangerous than the hair loss they cause.<br>  <br>  4. How about mom and dad? Hair loss, particularly pattern hair loss, is partially a result of heredity, and heredity from both sides. Unfortunately, this one can’t be reversed.<br>  <br>  5. Fungal infections of the scalp can cause hair loss. Usually, you will see the signs of these on your scalp. Have them diagnosed and get them treated!<br>  <br>  6. Harsh shampoos can cause increased hair loss. There is an ingredient in shampoo which causes it to lather – surfactant. Too much of this can cause itchy, dry, and scaly scalps, and those conditions can cause hair loss.<br>  <br>  If you find that you are doing everything right and have no diseases or scalp conditions, you will want to try other remedies, which fall into three categories.<br>  <br>  1. Medicines developed specifically for hair loss. There are a multitude of creams, pills, and ointments available to try. Everyone is different and what works for one will not necessarily work for you. You will need to experiment to find one that seems to work best for you.<br>  <br>  2. Natural remedies are available as well. Most of these include essential oils, that is, concentrated oils from specific plants. Provillus is a very good example of this method of hair loss treatment. Provillus is an oral supplement, which works to block DHT, a form of testosterone that is responsible for 95 percent of hair loss. <br>  <br>  It also works to stimulate the scalp and bring dead follicles back to life. You can use Provillus as a preventative tool, starting the program before hair loss becomes severe, or you can use it after DHT has already begun to take hold of your hair and scalp. <br>  <br>  3. Surgery: There are a wide variety of procedures available to you, however, they are quite costly. Any type of permanent hair replacement will take several months, several visits, and several trips to your bank account. Research your options, and get several consultations before a final decision.Try the least expensive and lifestyle change options first. If they work, you have saved yourself time and money. But don’t sit on the situation too long – hair loss can be a symptom of something more serious.<br>  <br>  You can order a free trial of Provillus from the source link below. You have a chance your brother didnt have. Help your self before its to late, you might even help your brother.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Hair loss is caused by many reasons such as malnutrition, illness, tension and other health problems.Perming, straightening, hair dyeing and bleaching ,hot combing, using heated rollers and hot wax inevitably damage the hair.Badly damaged hair breaks at the scalp.

I was losing a serious amount of hair every couple of months.. It took me a horrifying 2 or so years to stabilize but eventually it did. <br>  Anyway, I learned that some of the unnatural causes of hair loss can be (and i believe ARE) associated with external pollutants.<br>  <br>  For example: the smog in cities cause a lot of young and old women to go bald or semi-bald. The best way to deal with that, of course, is to leave these areas of high pollution. A simpler solution is to wash your hair after being in a high-pollution zone - every day if need be. <br>  According to that awesome doctor on Oprah (Dr. OZ), it is healthier for     your scalp to wash your hair under cold or mildly warm water. <br>  <br>  The chemicals in shampoos, conditioners and styling gels are also bad news. So you have to try and use the most gently products as possible.<br>  <br>  You may also have had a major fluctuation in your hormone levels. Perhaps you need to observe your diet. And it is ideal to constantly perform exercises that involve stimulation of the hypothalamus and thyroid glands. Yoga is the best possible answer to that. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, the more obvious reasons are that you experienced extraordinary trauma/heavy stress or you have baldness in your genes and it is your time... <br>  <br>  But I have problems with the definition of an incurable baldness that cannot be indefinitely halted. There is a new treatment on the market called Provillus. Apparently it's outstripping everything that's gone before it. If you want instant (and apparently guaranteed results) that would be your answer. <br>   <br>  Personally I would recommend a product called Hair Rebuilder by Aloe Vera. It's a sticky gel which you apply to your scalp every night for at least 2 months. Wash it off in the morning. You can also use it as styling gel.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1n2OESdBaa	Hi there,<br>  There are a number of reasons why your hair may be falling out, some of these include:<br>  After illness or major surgery<br>  Hormonal problems- if your thyroid is overactive or underactive your hair may fall out<br>  Some medicines also cause hair loss - but usually this will improve after you stop taking the medicine.<br>  Apart from that Common baldness or male-pattern baldness is the most common cause and is usually inherited.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Jules|`|0ds3JhY4aa	Male Pattern Baldness (MPB) is a genetic trait. It’s called Androgenetic Alopecia. It’s inherited from your family. If the men in your family are showing a bald spot on the crown, it’s likely you will too. <br>  <br>  This is an issue men have been dealing with for centuries. According to legend, Julius Caesar invented the laurel leaf wreath to cover his receding hairline.<br>  <br>  Too bad Julius didn’t have access to Provillus in the days of the Roman Empire. <br>  <br>  MPB results from genetic traits, and hormonal causes. Provillus can’t change your genetic history, but it can help with the hormonal causes.<br>  DHT (dihydrotestostrone) is derived from androgen, a male hormone. As the androgen circulates through the bloodstream, it is converted to DHT by the enzyme, 5-alpha reductase. DHT tends to bind to hair follicle receptors, <br>  causing the follicles to sprout thinner and thinner hairs until nothing regrows, and the follicles eventually wither away.|`|grOhOl9qaa	Well,its natural to lose hair so new hair can grow in so yes,your hair will fall out as time goes by,as long as its not too much hair your losing.It could be due to stress if your going through any at all?

Do that before considering any other option and see how it works.<br>  When I had long hair myself, the hair used to fall out like crazy, remember the longer your hair is, the more pressure you are applying to your hair follicles. Also do you tight up your hair with pony tails? that puts also a lot of pressure on the hair, so the roots weaken.<br>  <br>  Any other than the above, you could use a shampoo I have used myself successfully called "Alcepin" (just google it).<br>  However, nothing replaces seeing a doctor first!|`|j1dCtfNLaa	Avoiding or limiting foods and drinks that are high in alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and sugar can help greatly in hair loss prevention.<br>  Similarly, avoiding cholesterol-rich foods, which are linked to increased DHT levels, will also help.|`|FExrXqsKaa	It could also be a symptom of  hypothyroidism.

ufgv7oTjaa	I would assume it's a B-12 injection... if it's under a different name, the doctor will know it by that name anyway.<br>  B-12 can be injected or taken orally in pill form. Personally, I don't like the idea of the shots because it gives your body a mega-dose that overdoses the body and I've heard of too many occurrences where someone actually got sick for a day or two because of the overdose and they felt weak for a day or two before the next shot because their body had processed most all of it out of their system. I've found it to generally be healthier and more effective to take a daily dose of any nutrient instead of a mega-dose less often.<br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!

If it continues, go to the dr.|`|PzfozDAJaa	My advice to you would be to go to the hospital, they should give you the problems that are caused, and should allow you to take the correct tablets to eeze the pain, and should put a cast on it if it is badly damaged, sorry to hear about your heel.
LTsmr0SPaa	How would men react? I give my husband full credit for actually asking me to give him a frame of reference so that he could understand how I felt when I told him I was cramping. I told him it was like having really bad abdominal cramps that weren't relieved at all by going to the bathroom. He said the same thing then he said when I gave birth by C-section "I wouldn't be a woman if you paid me!"<br>    I will admit there have been a few times that I have suffered from "penis envy", but only on long hikes or situations where it would have been nice to just whip it out and relieve myself. What other reasons could there logically be? <br>    Being able to take matters in your own hands to relieve tension and produce endorphins without needing any artificial medication to do so.<br>    I love your line of reasoning. As for being the only ones capable of becoming astronauts or being in the armed forces--those same monthly cycles could become a problem for our intrepid men. What would happen if they had to face a choice of either taking enough ammunition to fight the enemy or enough "supplies"?<br>     What if a country was under siege and there were no manly supplies being delivered? Not even so much as an aspirin to relieve the PMS, cramps, and migraines to help these valiant sufferers get through.

zMD0VeOmaa	I cannot say for sure what the facility he went to will be like but I work at a hospital where they have a psych ward. I did rounds with nurses and the psychiatrists for a couple weeks as an intern where they discuss the patient's progress.<br>  <br>  Since your husband checked himself in voluntarily he should be able to leave the facility after a period of time. The doctors will want to keep him for awhile for observational purposes to monitor his progress. They will likely prescribe some anti-depressants such as paxil or cymbalta or prozac and/or anti-anxiety drugs such as Ativan or xanax for him. Sometimes they will also give the patient drugs such as Ambien to help them sleep. <br>  <br>  You can visit your husband at the facility if you get approval from them. You will have to call ahead and they will let you in.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope your husband feels better soon.

Stress can do a lot to a person.|`|Sn4zj9T3aa	The weight loss could be associated with the drugs, the cigarettes, and the unhealthy lifestyle. If you're younger and naturally not very heavy 148-132 isn't that much of a difference. If that drop was over 2 weeks, I'd be more concerned. Stress also causes weight loss. <br>  <br>  It could be this stress is associated with you're disgust and mistrusting nature toward women. You're transposing you're anger into fear. The root of hostility is fear.<br>  <br>  When you break it down ,your fears are irrational. 1.)You had sex ONCE, with 2.)ONE woman, a year ago...3.)ASSUMING she has copious amounts of AIDS virus in her 4.)vaginal secretions, WHEN her transmission rate was high, If you even contracted it....what really are the chances of all 4 of these variables coming together and  infecting you with the worst STD on the planet? Kinda slim...actually I believe it's something like 1 in 500,000. It's harder from men to get it than women, unless you're a homosexual or had anal sex.

That means don't worry about it. It doesn't mean continue to have unprotected sex.

Acute HIV (i.e. HIV contracted just a few days to weeks ago) can cause a brief flu like syndrome but this passes in a few days to a week or so.  Symptoms like weight loss and energy loss for several months don't show up until someone has had HIV for several years.<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind while waiting for the results - one estimate of the infectiousness of HIV puts the risk of getting HIV from a single episode of unprotected sex from someone who ALREADY has HIV at somewhere between 1 in 50 and 1 in 5000.  So even if that woman had HIV, it's unlikely that single encounter will give you trouble.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, be sure to check the results to be certain.  Good luck!

OgaJqkSQaa	No, because when you're on the pill it's not a period, just a withdrawal bleed. Have they investigated hy your periods haven't returned? I have heard that it can take a long time after the injection though.<br>  <br>  You might want to look into a herb called vitex agnus castus. I have pcos and I used it to get my cycle from 50 days down to 28 days. It helps balance the hormones and I'm pretty certain it's safe to use when ttc, although check up on this :) If you try it, get a good quality herb - tincture form is supposed to be good.

N9nJWYa5aa	I'm so jealous, I really want a road going recumbent bike!<br>  <br>  If you've already got both sets of DVDs I say which ever takes your fancy on a particular day.  You might want to modify this depending on who you live with.  If you have a set time when you can exercise in peace, use this time for your TaeBo, and then you can add in some Turbo Jam when others are around (it's more fun and you look less of a fool in company).  Regards the additional cardio, both TaeBo and Turbo Jam are pretty good cardio, though if I had a recumbent cycle it'd be hard to keep me off the roads.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, keep up the good work, and enjoy your cruise (including their gym - take full advantage you're paying for it!).|`|CHaGCTzfaa	Exercise is just as pivotal as food consumption when it comes to losing weight, but the only diet that clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

Try this, feel around it's neck, pushing in on some of the muscles and up and down the neck.  Is there any indication that there were tender spots?  Or how about muscles that are very tight?  I have relieved such muscles on myself and others and probably figure it out on a dog, but trying to explain might be harder.  I have had epilepsy and I found that after I relieved those muscles I've had a pretty painfree existance.  In fact, I wasn't aware that there were muscles that sore in the are until I was working on them.  Try what I suggested and if one of those things are present let me know and I'll try to help.
gPlUDaRoaa	Wow i totally feel for you.I was addicted to pain pills for 18yrs and i finally admitted to my self & my family that i had a problem.So i went to a treatment center for 10 days and it will be a year next month that i have been clean.It has been both a rough year & a good year.If you don't have medical insurance i would suggest calling your local social services and inquire about how you can go about getting it for your problem.Don't get discouraged if you don't have insurance call around there are people & programs out there to help you that is what they for so don't feel embarrassed to ask for help.Know that by going through treatment for your addiction does not mean that once you leave treatment you are cured.Because your not,you are going to have to live with this for the rest of your life.Don't fool yourself into thinking that once your detoxed & feeling good,you can take a couple here & there.Your going to have to get it in your head that you can never take just a couple again ever.If you get the urge to use,just think back to all you went through withdrawing off that crap & the living hell you went through.If this is something you are going to do on your own then i would suggest you maybe pick up some benadryl,it will help with the anxiety & will keep you kind of calmed down.But you really should let someone know whats going on with you because if your hardcore on these pills,withdrawing at home could be dangerous.Call your local hospital and ask to talk to the ER nurse.Good luck to you.|`|InSi6vUTaa	Oxycodone (oxycontin) is an opiate that is manufactured in controlled release tablets which are twice as potent as morphine. When used legally, this medication is intended to alleviate moderate to severe pain and is an active ingredient in percocet and percodan. Originally approved for use by the FDA in 1995, this pain killer has become a popular recreational drug along with heroin, vicodin, lortab and other similar opiates.<br>  <br>  The original labeling of this medication carried a warning that users should not crush these tablets because the result would be a release of lethal amounts of this drug. However, in addition to warning patients using the drug for legal purposes of this danger, it also informed recreational users of an added method of abuse. <br>  <br>  Oxycodone binds to pain receptors in the brain so that the sensation of pain is reduced. However, if used more frequently than prescribed or in larger doses, it also causes both mental and physical addiction by triggering intense feelings of pleasure in the brain - followed by a feeling of contentment that lasts for several hours. <br>  <br>  More Oxycodone Detox Articles Oxycodone Addiction <br>  Oxycodone Withdrawal <br>   <br>  For those individuals who have unfortunately become dependent upon this powerful opiate - many through no fault of their own - there is hope for highly motivated men and women who are ready to become free of chemical dependency. The Meditox Method is designed to provide a safe and effective form of oxycodone detox which will eliminate the need to experience the pain and misery of withdrawal.|`|sQETRcxtaa	1. u can go to detox <br>  2. u can try a suboxone program <br>  3. u can detox at home using ultrams/tramadols some sort of muscle relaxer and an anti anxiety medication start out taking meds every 4 hours then ween yourself down within 5 days till u are at meds every 12 hours. <br>  4. cold turkey<br>  <br>  talk to your doc first. <br>  <br>  an in house detox program usually consists of 6 days 5 nights with the meds listed in #3 and LOADS of AA meetings<br>  <br>  the suboxone program is basically trading one drug for another it keeps a steady level of narcotic in your body but actually blocks receptors so u can take narcotics but u wont feel them. you will be expected to take them for 6 months up to 2 years sometimes longer.<br>  They will ALSO sugegst you go to NA/AA meetings while in this program. Its to get you used to NOT taking the narcotics then they detox you so basically all this does is delay your actual detox. <br>  <br>  choice 3 is like going to a detox hospital but its basically a do it yourself recipe NOT RECCOMENDED unless you are familiar with the meds and dosing schedules for detoxing. <br>  <br>  cold turkey is the worst and also NOT RECCOMENDED as u will get sick as heck and can go into siezures or worse. <br>  <br>  Whichever your choice good luck take care of your body while going through the detoxing stay hyrdated and id also reccomend taking a multivitamin as well.|`|lFR1YxzSaa	Call your Doctor!
bogfZ6Xsaa	I don't know how many pounds 2 stones are in America....I'm assuming you live in the UK so to get a real answer you may have to convert to American English words!! But I think in order to keep the weight off you need to eat a little healthier and do a little cardio exercise every other day and maybe a little stretching and maybe some weights on the other off days.<br>  Hope this helped!|`|OL5WYfAOaa	hi, i lost just over 4 stone (14.5-15 down to 10.5) it took me 18months to 2 years. I never used to exercise and then i started to and i enjoyed it and now love it. Try getting a membership at the gym dont cancel it and just make sure you go.<br>  <br>  Eating i found it really difficult, i used to be able to eat as much as i want and still not be full up. You have to "train" yourself in terms of eating, just before your getting full stop eating. When you over eat you feel bloated and it takes longer to digest. I was 18 when i started losing it and im now 20 and just need a little more off. <br>  <br>  Once you start a diet and start exercising it will drop off (considering you do it properly) then you will reach a point where you stop and dont seem to be getting anywhere, dont whatever you do stop what your doing. If anything get a little more healthier, exercise that little bit more and give it 2 to 3 weeks and it will slowly start coming off again. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)
S1A20Oouaa	I developed an allergy to penicillin when I was in my 30's.  I had hives for nine days.  I can never take it again.  You might have to wear a medical alert bracelet stating that you are allergic to augmentin.  You could have a  much worse reaction if you ever take it again.  Good Luck!

There is NO such thing as a safe food allergy.  My son has egg and milk allergies. As a result, I have learned a little bit about how they work.  <br>  <br>  What happens is that the antibodies in your system mistake it as something that it needs to attack.  Continued exposure will remind the antibodies to fight it.  Over time, they might think they need to fight it harder since it keeps coming back.<br>  <br>  That's why when a baby or toddler is diagnosed with a food allergy, they tell us that with 100% avoidance they have a good chance of outgrowing the allergy.  That's because their immune system is still developing.  So as it grows, it might forget about that thing that it once thought was a virus or something.<br>  <br>  I've put it into very simple terms because that is how it was explained to us by our son's allergist.<br>  <br>  You are best off to see an allergist and be tested and figure out exactly what you are allergic to.  It's just a simple blood test.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	dont eat chocolate
AA11830724	The best thing to do would be to call your primary care Dr or your gyn and see if they can get you in before then.  The longer it goes untreated the more uncomfortable you will be and it may worsen.  If they cant squeeze you in you could try a med center or urgent care facility. If you cant be seen by anyone there are a few things that will help ease some of your symptoms.  Drink lots of water and try some cranberry juice.

Both great grandmothers having breast cancer is a very small risk factor especailly if they developed it after menopause. <br>  <br>  The blood test would not have shown cancer<br>  <br>  2 weeks is not unusual.  Often doctors do this so that patients don't have to worry so long<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor if he/she thinks vitamin E might help prevent or resolve these in your case<br>  <br>  It's not related to your tonsil.  The only way this could be is if it were a lymph node and they are both responding to an infection.  Lymph nodes near the breast are above the collar bone and in the arm pit, not palpable in the breast itself. Tonsils stay swollen after an infection for some time too, and your test was negative so I say no.  Not related<br>  <br>  Have the test but the odds of something being serious are slim given the information you told me so try to stay calm

If he continues isolating then I would get him some professional help as soon as possible.

Retainers, particularly the braced retainers (meaning they have a wire running over your front teeth), are designed to hold your teeth in position. Over time, your retainer can be used to move your teeth back to where you want them.<br>  <br>  The orthodontist wouldn't adjust your retainer simply because the way you're wearing it right now was the "best fit" at the end of your treatment. The purpose of the retainer is to retain the best fit position of your teeth. <br>  <br>  I doubt you'll be in any serious pain, but if you've stopped wearing them for a month and a half, they will be slightly painful for 1-2 weeks. I recommend wearing them at nights only, simply because towards the end of your treatment period you are instructed to wear your retainers as often as is necessary. <br>  <br>  Following the nightly routine, you should feel your retainer grow loose and fit better after about two weeks.<br>  <br>  Wearing it 24/7 except when eating will move your teeth back within a week. <br>  <br>  If in any doubt, or if your gums are bleeding, make sure to contact your orthodontist right away.
dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's possibly an infection and you should see a doc.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	This is not necessarily an infection. Discharge can occur as a result of erosion of the cervix. Not as bad as it sounds. Basically it means that the cells in your cervix are changing into a different type of cell that secretes mucus. This is not dangerous to your health and is not linked to cancer. Get a referral to a gynaecologist to find out for sure, and if it is that, the cells can be lasered away (painlessly).

EMNwWAuvaa	Sarah, have the therapist that is working with you try this.  Start with the uninvolved knee.  If you have access to a prone hamstring curl start with the normal leg.  Do three sets of ten to fifteen repetitions with a one minute rest period in between sets.  Now go to the other leg and try that leg the same way.  The weight factor is going to have to be different but go through three sets of ten to fifteen repetitions with the one minute rest period in between.  The knee should improve with each series.  On the normal leg the object is to push the leg as much as it can handle safely.  The body has an overflow mechanism where work done on one side flows into the other making that side perform better.

JhL9kC05aa	Heartburn or pyrosis is a painful and burning sensation in the esophagus, just below the breastbone usually associated with regurgitation of gastric acid. The pain often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the jaw. Heartburn is also identified as one of the causes of chronic cough, and may even mimic asthma. Despite its name, heartburn actually has nothing to do with the heart. It is so called because of a burning sensation of the breastbone where the heart is located although some heart problems do have a similar sensation to heartburn. Compounding the confusion is the fact that hydrochloric acid from the stomach comes back up the esophagus because of a problem with the cardiac sphincter, a valve which misleadingly contains the word "cardiac," referring to the cardia as part of the stomach and not, as might be thought, to the heart. Overeating, spicy foods, caffeinated beverages, alcohol and even stress can lead to symptoms of heartburn. It is not always possible to avoid them all. There are many natural remedies for heartburn and many over the counter medicines for heartburn relief. Chronic heartburn symptoms should not be ignored and should be evaluated by a physician, as they can indicate more serious medical conditions and acid in the esophagus can lead to erosion of the esophagus. Natural remedies for heartburn include fennel and peppermint, however, some doctors advise against peppermint, saying it brings on heartburn in some people. Fennel seeds can be seeped in water to create a soothing tea. Fennel is an ingredient in many products sold by companies that sell natural remedies for heartburn and other conditions. Peppermint oil listed is an ingredient in some over the counter medicines for heartburn and indigestion. Fennel seeds and peppermint have been used by Native Americans and Europeans as natural remedies for heartburn.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	It all depends on what you eat and maybe if you have acid reflux. I am 23 and get heartburn sometimes when I eat acidic foods like grapefruit, spaghetti sauce or hot sauce. It all depends on your system. Once you find the foods that give you pain, eat them in moderation. You shouldn't worry unless it's chronic. If it doesn't go away, I'd go to the doctor to check for acid reflux which will eat away at your esophagus. Good Luck!|`|EoroQbCraa	You can get heartburn at any age.

It could be from something you ate or drank like soda (pop). There are many things on the market for occasional heartburn. I think the best is Gaviscon. But a home remedy is a little baking soda mixed in water and drink it. It will sweeten the stomach and reduce the acid until you eat or drink something that gives you too much acid again. If you keep getting it you need to see a Dr for a prescription or buy one of the acid relievers OTC and use it for a while. I've had it most of my life.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	You can have heart burn at any age. My son was born with what is called reflux. That means the piece that closes the top of the stomach does not close all the way. That causes heart burn. I have found with my son if he eats to much bread it will act up. Some times if you eat spices food it will act up. Prilosec works great. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Michelle

It doesn't definitely mean you have diabetes, nor does it definitely mean you have ketones.  Sometimes bubbles form as the urine hits the water.  It's harmless.  You can't diagnose yourself with a life-threatening illness just because you have bubbles in your urine.|`|ympCibR4aa	Bubbles in your urine could  indicate kidney disease.  You should tell your health care provider about this symptom.   They could get more information from a urinalysis and/or blood tests.
iK3YYRaTaa	First of all , A HBA1C is not used to test for diabetes. No matter what you read on answers. The doctor is stupid to do a HBA1C unless you were diagnosed with diabetes.  HBA1C is used to see how you are controling you glucose level afeter you are a diabetic. You need either A fasting test a random test or a glucose tolerance test. <br>  <br>  What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test<br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have. <br>  Hope this answers  your question.But the most important thing is to change doctors.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	YOU DO NOT HAVE DIABETES. If you did, the A1C would be high.  Yours is just fine.  You do not have diabetes.

You are most likely in the early stages of type two diabetes. The symptoms you describe are very much like mine were six years ago. <br>  <br>  The fix is, get on a healthy, raw natural foods based diet, and get plenty of daily exercise. The nutrients in the diet will give you more energy while satiating your appetite as well as nourishing the all important insulin producing cells in your pancreas. The exercise will help burn off the triglycerides that contribute to the insulin resistance increasing your metabolism while helping to keep excess weight off. <br>  <br>  Look up 'metabolic syndrome' for more. Or visit some of the places I've linked in my profile. You can also Google, "Mr. Peachy" and find my posts on tudiabetes.com.|`|pRF5LLloaa	The A1C test is MUCH more accurate that the "finger stick" tests.  The A1C test should be the primary source of information leading to a diagnosis of diabetes (or not), with the Glocusoe Tolerance Test used as a follow up and verification.<br>  <br>  if your A1C readings are within the 5 to 6 range then you are NOT diabetic, or you are controlling it very well!  If a diabetic person can keep theri A1C reading in the 5 to 6 range, the diabetes will have no effect on their life.  if your A1C reading is between 5 and 6 there is no medical reason to change your current treatment method -- which in your case is nothing.<br>  <br>  Diabetes canNOT be diagnosed through symptoms alone!  The symptoms of diabetes are shared by MANY other diseases --including puberty!  For example, diabetes causes tingling in the hands and feet -- but so does a "slipped disk" in the spine.  Diabetes casues blurred vision -- but so does the beginnings of cataracts.<br>  <br>  And diabetes causes intense thirst -- but so does dry winter weather!  And when you drink a lot -- you pee a lot!<br>  <br>  The A1C test is the most accurate test currently used to diagnose diabetes. and based on your result you've listed here -- YOU ARE NOT DIABETIC.<br>  <br>  What you need to "get a grip" on is your emotions.  it is very clear that YOU do not have a medical degree, so complaining about the doctor's diagnosis is a useless waste of money and time.<br>  <br>  if you insist that you still have diabetes, you should consult with a psychiatrist.  it appears that you have such a need for sympathy (given your social status) that you will do ANYTHING to garner sympathy -- including wasting the doctor's time and your money.|`|MATiTs5Oaa	Diabetes( high blood sugar levels) and hypoglycemia(low  blood sugar levels )  are treated with the exactly same diet. stay away from white potatoes, white rice, and white breads, and pastas, and fruit juice. Eat 6 times a day (small amounts). Eat proteins and lots of veggies. Eat moderate amount of fruit. Don't eat sugar. Never be hungry and never eat too much. Diabetes does not mean that you are going to die within a year, it does not mean you need insulin, it does not mean you will have blurred vision. If the pancreas is still working they may give you meds to make it work as it should ( plus a diet of course). Or they may choose not to give any meds, just , give a suitable diet so that it does not have to work too much . If it is not working at all, then you should use insulin. Then, you are free to eat sugar, because you are regulating the insulin in your body yourself. But this is a phase further. I'm diabetic for lots of years and I'm using meds, but I'm still not using insulin for example, I'm not in that phase. If , diabetes stays untreated, then it may harm veins and arteries. Meanwhile it may cause damage in eyes ( hence blurred vision ) but not necessarily. If it harms the veins and arteries in the penis for example, it may cause impotency. But, not necessarily.  It takes a long time of unattended diabetes to do that. Don't freak. If you have the means, get a lab result elsewhere. If you have unexplained weight loss, it may also be that your Thyroid is working too much. Are you also more nervous than usual? If so, get yourself checked for thyroids  too. If you are urinating too much, it may be that you have bladder infection. Then, only some antibiotics will be sufficient. Don't get upset. None of these are fatal. Get a break.<br>  Take care.|`|23d301972b7aa34f0dee311075c3c233aa	I'm confused as to why you want a diabetes diagnosis if you're not diabetic?  You're not diabetic.  WIth an A1C of 5.4, you're not going to die within a year.  Type one diabetics such as myself have survived with A1Cs three times what yours is.  You don't need insulin.  If your A1C is perfect, your sugars are perfect, too.  Labwork doesn't lie, especially when it's been done repeatedly such as in your case.  Work on your weight loss, proper nutrition, and keeping active and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  PS: An A1C of 5.4 does not indicate hypoglycemia. In fact, it's a perfect value. You're perfectly healthy.

BKxAt8mNaa	Probally a few, but not enough to lose any weight.<br>  Well, you would lose WEIGHT but not FAT weight. Only water weight. <br>  I'd guess only about 3% of calories are expelled through laxatives.<br>  xxxx|`|4GNNOQeLaa	If you take them before your intestines have time to absorb nutrients you can decrease the calories absorbed, but if its been a while since you have eaten then you won't.  Laxatives are not a good alternative to lose weight and I would suggested eating a good breakfast while decreasing your overall caloric intake throughout the day.  Burning more calories than you take in will help you lose weight.  Taking a multi-vitamin will also help cover the vitamin deficiency you may have if you don't have a balanced diet.  Using a laxative constantly can have some adverse effects and also decrease the absorption of nutrients your body does need.|`|cGNTSoc9aa	please dont ever use laxatives as a form of weight loss.... i know the thought is, the quicker out the less damage the food is doing to me, however, your body will forget how to process food and expel it properly, winding up with you not being able to poo properly, as daft as it sounds, its completely true. You cant expect to be on laxatives the rest of your life, so you will come off them eventually and wont be able to pass waste.|`|MnTvROkmaa	maybe|`|lWD8f9veaa	hahaha, maybe... your body will burn calories as you poop... but only the energy used to contract your muscles that push out the poop, and maybe if you count the walk to the toilet.  , oh and the act of wiping.  Laxatives wont burn calories in your body while you are sitting watching TV (if that's what you're asking)  they will cause you to lose weight because diarrhea makes you lose water, and you will lose any weight you have in poop that is sitting in your colon.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Nope.  Those calories would've came out once you went to the bathroom anyway, they just speed up the process.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Well you lose calories when you do a poo, so yes. But it's not actually that much more than if you hadn't taken laxatives and let things happen naturally.<br>  There was a study done recently where a group of people ate a big meal (over 2000 calories) and half took laxatives and half waited for nature to do its work. The people that took laxatives never passed more than 100 calories more than those that didn't.<br>  Frequently using laxatives also seriously damages the bowels and wider digestive system.

Don't scare the kiddies, answerers.|`|r5ge48OKaa	Your period should come every 28 to 30 days. However if you had your first period, it usually is never consistent and may not be right on track.

zLUQJxJkaa	No there is no difference. When the warrior is ready for action they look the same.<br>  Also, you will NOT lose sensitivity to the penis. Circumcision does not harm the nerve used for sexual activities. And you won't lose sensitivity due to not having it covered- my doctor said that argument is like saying that if you don't wear a glove on your hand almost all the time then you won't feel as much as if you did.. just not true.<br>  There is a psychological factor.. a guy can THINK he doesn't feel as much.<br>  There are no major benefits to either, whatever you want.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	you weren't circumcised as a baby like 85% of men? cool<br>  <br>  i've asked girls and they say they don't really care<br>  and why would you want to get circumcised? there are no benefits to it<br>  <br>  i dunno why your ween smells, but i know even cut guys have BO down there<br>  <br>  maybe you're not washing well or using soap (which you're not supposed to do) or not drying the head after the shower which can cause odor|`|sTdlAMv7aa	If you're looking to last longer & maintain glans sensitivity, there are other options than circumcision (i.e. kegels).  The glans will become less sensitive with time after circumcision as it gets keratinized from brushing against clothing all day.|`|CWcipoG7aa	I'm 37 and not circumcised and my wife loves it. Most American woman are brain washed thinking that uncircumcised men are not the norm when in fact we are the norm and being circumcised is a cosmetic and hygiene thing. <br>  <br>  Why are you contemplating whether or not to get circumcised?<br>  <br>  Being uncircumcised demands a little more hygiene and that's it! <br>  If you get circumcised be prepared to lose some sensitivity and pleasure while masturbating or having intercourse. Don't do it!<br>  <br>  Most woman will admit that once they get a hold of a guy who isn't circumcised they won't let him go unless there shallow and in that case you don't want them or need people like that in your life.<br>  <br>  If its odor you are worrying about then give this a go:<br>  Use unscented soap to wash your privates, once you get out of the shower make sure you pull back the foreskin to allow your penis head to dry otherwise you will get an odor. Make sure its dry before you allow the foreskin to overlap.<br>  <br>  To the guy who said you will not lose any sensitivity. Cutting off the foreskin will not only remove the skin but it'll remove all the nerve endings at the tip of the foreskin which decrease your sensitivity and pleasure while having intercourse.

Some guys get cut and only lose some sensitivity.

It was forced on me, and I suffered more than the usual loss of sensitivity from the damage.<br>  <br>  Circumcision always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  It very frequently causes adverse effects and complications that the doctors won't disclose and in fact suppress, as they make money from circumcision, and very frequently belong to the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  Very, very few men ever choose to be circumcised.<br>  The vast majority of circumcised men had it forced on them as infants, and had no choice in the matter, and couldn't fight back against this assault.<br>  <br>  I'm restoring my foreskin, and have vastly improved sexual sensitivity and function, and the intensity of orgasms is also dramatically increased.<br>  <br>  I suggest you look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS to find out some of the adverse effects of this before you become another victim.<br>  <br>  While it's your penis to do with as you please, you may want more information before you become another victim.<br>  <br>  About 200,000 guys are restoring now, and we all would have given just about anything to have been left natural and normal with a foreskin; the way that nature intended.<br>  <br>  You should be proud to have a whole penis, unmutilated and fully functional.<br>  <br>  Look before you leap; most men who were circumcised haven't got a clue about the sexual sensitivity of which they've been deprived.       Sex still feels good to most of them, but they have no idea about how much better it feels with a complete penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|E64juLwJaa	Had it done at age 23:you loose some sensitivity,but last longer due to that too,<br>  Never did I make a better decision:it feels great<br>  Planets.

0TT5q0cUaa	Few tips to bring about weight loss as well as ensuring good health:<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, and grain products like wheat. <br>  Increase the consumption of complex carbohydrates like whole wheat, millet (jowar) and barley (bajra)<br>  <br>  Restrict refined products such as flour (maida) and its products such as bread, noodles, macaronis and pastas in regular diet<br>  <br>  Restrict fat and cholesterol rich foods. Only non-vegetarian foods (like eggs and dairy products) are good sources of cholesterol, however saturated fatty acids present in butter, ghee, vanaspati and coconut get metabolised to cholesterol in our body<br>  <br>  Reduce the amount of sugars consumed<br>  <br>  Consume raw fruits and vegetables in form of salads and raitas in every meal. These provide adequate vitamins, minerals and fibre. Fibre is essential as it aids in digestion, has an effective role in managing obesity and cardiovascular problems<br>  <br>  Limit salt intake<br>  <br>  Have small portions of food at a time<br>  <br>  Do not skip meals<br>  <br>  Have regular meal timings<br>  <br>  Do not eat while cooking and watching television<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water (6-8 glasses) in a day<br>  <br>  Exercise regularly.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

It doesn't hurt - it should take about 30-60 minutes for either a upper/lower or full mouth to come out. <br>  <br>  Your teeth will feel slimy when they are done - you've had metal on them for so long that they will feel weird when they are all nice & smooth again - good luck - congrats on getting them off :)
Rwf8D5toaa	The most common candidates are a bacterial infection (bacterial vaginosis), a chemical irritant, or simple irritation.<br>  <br>  A yeast infection is less likely, since that isn't usually accompanied by so much inflammation.<br>  <br>  As for the timing, it was probably aggravated by the rough sex, especially if you didn't use adequate lubrication. (That just happens sometimes.) It may have been in the early stages already. Alternately, the sex may have left your body vulnerable to an infection or irritation.<br>  <br>  Treat your body gently and avoid any sexual contact with your genitals until you have healed. I would probably recommend trying to get an appointment with your doctor.<br>  <br>  As for STDs, if you are at all worried, just get tested. If either of you has ever had sex or any sexual contact with anyone other than each other, go ahead and get tested. (An STD doesn't even mean your boyfriend cheated on you necessarily. It could be a disease that was previously dormant.)|`|uVMlNvLoaa	I learned the hard way that I was allergic to both the latex condom and the nonoxyl-9 spermicide that's put on nearly condoms. I got a yeast infection every time after we used one.<br>  <br>  If you suspect that it's latex allergy, use some polyurethane condoms without the spermicide--it might relieve your pain.<br>  <br>  Sex by itself always carries a risk of messing up your pH--some women tend to have yeast infections once and a while after intercourse.<br>  <br>  Experiment around, and be safe. You might want to consider the pill, and getting your partner tested. :3|`|ZhnxOA2Maa	lol <br>  Condoms don't prevent STDs<br>  <br>  You got the fire crotch|`|9YQVIolwaa	lol he cheated on u and now passed whatever she had... eeeww me no wants till cured....  =p|`|IM3QwSS2aa	okay, weird advice coming from a man but here goes:<br>  take some Oil of Oregano capsules to work internally.<br>  apply some diluted Oil of Oregano to the distressed vaginal areas, not internally, in the vaginal walls.|`|H7HZXTaWaa	Sometimes rough sex can cause irritation to the vaginal area, so I really can't tell you what it is.  You and your boyfriend should have been tested before having sex to be sure neither of you had anything.  Then you would know it was just irritation.
Mm7NMWXraa	Sounds full menopausal to me. My mom had her moments - daily - but nothing to this extreme. But each woman goes through menopause differently. <br>  <br>  Make sure she is getting enough vitamins, minerals, and water. And that she has been to a doctor recently and has good blood pressure. <br>  <br>  Help relieve her menopause symptoms by giving her some herbs (my mom used a free trial and they worked for her so she continued with them and things settled down at the house)<br>  <br>  Turn the AC on full blast and don't invite friends over.

My advise is to get used to it.<br>  <br>  I'm a nudist and never wear clothes in my house unless company is coming over.  My wife is a part time nudist lol ... that means she wears clothes sometimes, but will quickly lose them when a "hot flash" arrives.  So I would say your mom's behavior is perfectly normal, for a nudist.  There are several millions of us out there, enjoying life without the encumbrance of clothing. <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong or dirty about the human body.  I'm more concerned about your rather strong aversion to it, then I am her affinity for nudity.  <br>  <br>  I suspect that long after you have found a job and moved the heck out of Mom's house, she will still be living her life the way she wants. lol<br>  <br>  You'll just have to stay after the job search.  Maybe accept a position that doesn't quite match your expectations so you can get a place of your own ... then you can do whatever you want in your house lol
uJKTR4d2aa	Load of crap. I wouldnt buy it at all. You cant get a six pack or firm abs just by wearing something.<br>  <br>  No, i have not tried it. However, there have been hundreds of products exactly like that for years now that all say 100% satisfaction and all that other stuff. Its garbage though. Through all the years these companies have made those, it is still not possible to spot reduce<br>  <br>  Spot reducing, aka building abs simply from that, is a physical impossiblity. You have to already be at a fit healthy weight and doing exercise/weights in order to have abs. Which is there subliminal advertising.<br>  <br>  You notice they show them on fit people who are exercising and not overweight poeple who are sitting down. in their way, thats them telling you that you have to exercise, lose weight, and then use it to see results. If your going to do all that though why waste money|`|tIldpr7vaa	i have tried a very similar product, with NO results<br>  <br>  The problem is even IF they make ur abs stronger (simulate real ab workouts), you still wont see your abs unless you get rid of the fat between your ab muscles and skin. Simply working the muscle underneath the fat wont burn off the fat above, you cannot target fat loss. Fat loss can ONLY be done with a good diet and lots cardio.<br>  <br>  Gabe is right
3YJe5Z4Faa	Sounds like both a minor concussion AND a bad blow to the head.  Time will relieve the pain... until then, only medication and rest will help the pain.<br>  <br>  See a doctor if seizure, passing out, repeated vomiting, trouble with vision or hearing, numbness or weakness in a part of the body, or lethargy.  Also see a doctor if still having pain after 5 days.|`|0a59616d0e7f84a6e411f50c3cf9f584aa	i;d finish first rather than last :P
AqU180claa	You could put a little bit of vitamin e oil on your bruises. And it will help them fade away.|`|3QkVoT2kaa	You could try witch hazel, which you buy cheaply from most chemists.

znjl6WrWaa	I had implantation bleeding. It was bright red for 2 days and then it became brownish red spotting for about a week. check with your doctor to be sure everything is ok.|`|uVMlNvLoaa	I haven't had experience with this personally, but if it's around your period it's probably spotting. Are you on birth control, or are you trying to conceive?<br>  <br>  And it's sex. Not "baby dancing".|`|fYMWDQLGaa	ITS SAID THT IMPLANTATION BLEEDING IS BROWNISH SPOTS WITH CRAMPING. <br>  <br>  GOODLUCK N LOTS OF BABY DUST DEAR...|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I had it with my first two and it lasted about 4 days both times.
Px8urrAuaa	It honestly doesn't matter to me.<br>  As long as you use it right, that's what makes the difference. :)<br>  <br>  I can't speak for all women, it's just personal preference. I guess circumcised might look nicer, but whatever YOU prefer is what matters. Most girls will love you for you, not whether you have foreskin or not.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	I am a respected female, and in my opinion, it does not matter at all. I would respect you more for leaving it as is, than if you change it to be like everyone else. <br>  And so many girls care more about what is in the back of your pants (the wallet) than what is in the front. Avoid them.|`|zHmZkMStaa	Not to embarass you; but can a gay guy chime in here?  Please don't go thru all the pain and inconvenience of getting circumcized at this age.  Many people find it attractive.  You're more 'natural' than cut guys are.  Though there's a bit more hygiene for you to care about, truth is, you probably have more 'staying power' than most cut guys according to studies.  Also; foreskins are more fun to fiddle with :)|`|H7HZXTaWaa	Truthfully, I have never seen a penis that wasn't circumcised.  I have heard that sex feels the same for a woman either way, but can't tell you from my own experience.  Getting circumcised is a personal thing, if you feel you want to be circumcised then go ahead, but if you don't really want to then keep your foreskin!  It is your penis and if a woman judges you on this than she probably doesn't respect/ love you enough to be seeing it in the first place.|`|6uo0NbUgaa	I don't think girls would care at all, I know I don't.  Girls care more about what a guy is like than what his dick looks like anyway.  I would highly recommend that you DO NOT get it circumsized.  That sounds extremely traumatic and I heard that it will make it less sensitive.|`|tCmwFJn5aa	It is a very painful procedure to get circumsized at your age.  If you aren't getting infections or irritations.  Leave it as is.  I don't think that the females mind either way.|`|Q2nRbZjJaa	a lot of girls are really grossed out by them but i mean it's just like any other thing - some guys are grossed out by different kinds of boobs<br>  <br>  its really normal in europe if youre that concerned just move there, i wouldnt get circumsized at this age it probably hurts like hell|`|UMouJTJeaa	uncircumsized...

What i used to do is lay flat on the ground on my stomach. then id pick my feet to the position and my arms out aligned with my shoulders. then i'd lift up and down. Since i was stretched out when i started and kept my feet and hands in place, i didnt hunch my back|`|aXnVFFUkaa	this link shows how to do them correctly|`|iPje1iyGaa	Keep your back straight and your abs tight.  Make sure your hands are facing forward and are on the floor slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Hi Ade,<br>  Maybe it is just my perceptions, but it seems to me that people are getting bolder and meaner in their communication over the internet. I think it is because they can hide behind annonymity and just spout off words without any regard for how it affects others.  When you are already feeling angry, the last thing you want to hear is criticism....it is hard enough to hear that when you are feeling calm and neutral.  The person who wrote that paragraph is an arrogant and insensitive person who took advantage of your vulnerable state of mind to spout off something that was not at all helpful. Just let it go, and know that in the future to be careful about disclosing too much information about yourself in a public forum.  There are a lot of whacky people out there.<br>  <br>  And, and to be direct, no, this answer is NOT justified.|`|6koVzvNlaa	Honestly speaking, anybody who went that great length on an Yahoo answer is only trying to help. So, Yes, you are over reacting a little bit.<br>  But, that is very much of a symptom of borderline personality disorder.<br>  <br>  I am very happy that you are being helped. During therapy, you will gradually learn a whole new way of thinking. Hopefully, your attitude toward people and life will change.  You want to be happy, right?|`|TdqeC0vmaa	Well two things are going on here. <br>  <br>  Yes. we over react to things.<br>  <br>  First you over reacted to the exam results and rambled on yahoo feelings and thoughts that might have been totally different an hour or two later. <br>  I have bpd too. When something strikes an emotional chord in us its no holds bard. These intense over reactive feelings happen and we have an urge to also get them out of us. So you, like I, sometimes write on yahoo answers about the momentary feelings that seem so very appropriate at the moment. <br>  <br>  But what the question ends up sounding like is exactly the kind or responses that you got. And you have to try to understand it from a readers perspective. They do not know when reading a ranting sometimes irrationally emotional question that the person who wrote it has bpd. All they can go off of is the question itself. So yes your question may have seemed like you were blaming others hateful etc. When you are not. But you are bpd and at that moment you may have been because you were triggered by your grades. <br>  <br>  So thats the first half. And the second half is heightend alertness to criticism over sensitivity and overreaction to the responses themselves. Also a normal aspect of bpd. <br>  <br>  So first we get "all fired up" overreacting. We ask about it. And the questions make us look and sound selfish irresponsible... whatever. And then we in turn get negative or critical answers, which based only on our ranting question may be legitimate, causing us to be hurt and "all fired up" all over again about the answer to our question. <br>  <br>  Ive come to realize this in my own use of yahoo answers having bpd. <br>  <br>  What Ive started to try to do to make it easier on myself is to write out the question when Im all worked up but NOT post it. <br>  To leave it sitting there written and unsubmitted for a few hours. Then I'll reread it and see if I should post it or not when my mood is less severe.<br>  And Ive tried very hard to not take to heart so much the negative and cruel responses I may receive especially if I know I wrote the question when I was extremely worked up.|`|mi3Udvroaa	Yes, I have the same problem, but everyone will just keep telling you that you are responsible for yourself and your actions, but I think most people like blaming others for their problems. I do it all the time, it's certainly easier than blaming myself. It's just about choosing the easier way to cope with anger.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I can't understand why you would be angry about the exam, unless the professor was somehow extremely unfair.  Science classes are usually a lot harder than liberal arts classes, even for people who are good at science and math.  You're supposed to study 6-10 hours a week for a science class, and even more for some classes (physics, calculus) plus time for prepping for exams.<br>  <br>  I agree with the person who said that you will have poor relationships and be miserable all your life if you let this go on. I have very severe bipolar disorder, but have excellent relationships with others, because I keep a lid on it. I have asked my husband to stay away from me when I am having a really bad time (breaking things, for example). I went thru years of severe sexual abuse besides. If I can get a handle on my behavior thru self-education and therapy, so can you.  You may also require medications. (I have not been able to find any to help me, though, after trying over 20 of them and even electroshock last year).<br>  <br>  The central symptoms of borderline are fear of abandonment and a feeling of "emptiness." Mood instability can be other things, if you don't have the abandonment issues or emptiness.  Unfortunately, many people with borderline "go off" on others, and lose the very relationships they are despertate to keep. You have to do a post-mortem and figure out why you couldn't walk away, or count to ten, etc - why did you go off on someone? Then modify the situation next time. Perhaps work out a plan with that person, trying to figure out triggers that they can avoid.  And you MUST learn to apologize sincerely and often. Sometimes that will still not be enough - people can't handle being verbally attacked. But it is the minimum. You CANNOT give yourself permission to go off on others, ever, it is never ok. Do not justify your behavior. It is wrong.<br>  <br>  Also, DBT or dialectical behavior therapy, is very effective for treating BPD. -it has a very high success rate. Look into it.

5HFOYjCMaa	At first I was going to write that yes it was too much because you can't eat double as much just to make up for a meal.  But I have to tell you that what you ate isn't so bad.  Calories aren't just calories no matter what you eat.  Eggs and bacon are actually what is suggested by Dr. Oz to have every morning because it gives you protien.  Cheese has calcium so in moderation it is fine.  You should look at what kind of toast your eating because everyone thinks that just because it says wheat it's healthy...it has to have no enriched flour and no high fructose corn syrup.  A little butter never hurt anyone but if you like peanut butter, it's much better for you!  Glass of skim milk is good and I don't knwo what kind of granola bar but look for one that doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup.  So even though it looks as if you had a lot of calories for one sitting, it's all good calories, things you body is happy about you ingesting.|`|04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	Actually it doesn't matter what time of the day you eat.  If you are trying to stay with in a certain calorie range everyday, you could eat all of those calories at one time and it wouldn't matter.  Now, I wouldn't advise doing that, because you might get hungry at other times. No worries, you're ok.|`|0bab5b072351ed63b6da5bcf0dbdcc9caa	its fine why are u so paranoid lol its just brunch ?<br>  <br>  loads of people do it, and people have them kind of lunches on sundays anyways <br>  dont eat so much that you not hungry and your still eating<br>  just eat a resonable amount in future<br>  like make your breakfast eat it, and then make a sandwich and eat it half an hour later so your breakfast has time to digest|`|uUbiu131aa	not good as an everyday thing.. but if you really really need the cals then i guess its okay (if you are a weight trainer or exercise vigorusly)|`|ji5vcwcvaa	That's okay but I don't think you should make that an everyday thing :]|`|23bs0kAKaa	Take a deep breath... if you can take a deep breath you are not a robot, if you are not a robot, CHILL THE F**K OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|LCLpSa5Faa	Nopee.|`|2uZivThaaa	Yeah that's great! Your body burns 75% of what you eat in the morning 50% of what you eat at noon and only 20% of what you eat at dinner! So its a good idea to eat a large healthy breakfast and snack on fruits and veggies all day. When dinner time comes around try to limit your self to a glass of milk or a bowl of cereal. Its recommended that you should not eat 3 hours before you go to bed because your body does not burn as many calories while you sleep.|`|QvDOyPjBaa	It's fine...besides, you probably won't be hungry for awhile and you'll have plenty of time to burn off your meal|`|GaAPIDzMaa	good idea i do it every day|`|brSfRLspaa	oh yeah stuff your face out that's always the best  diet plan
tCmwFJn5aa	If you are going to go through with this no matter what advice you get to not do it.  Then yes, it is painful the first time and sore the second time.  You must use a condom, no matter how much you love your bf everytime that you do it. KY Jelly is helpful the first few times.  You may have some spotting or bleeding make sure that you have tissue and panty liners.|`|dpgXzMenaa	For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|NeUU2rrSaa	Hiya. First Of All Its Good You Are On The Pill.

3QIWdvG1aa	Symptoms of a common cold usually appear about one to three days after exposure to a cold virus. Signs and symptoms of a common cold may include:<br>  <br>      * Runny or stuffy nose<br>      * Itchy or sore throat<br>      * Cough<br>      * Congestion<br>      * Slight body aches or a mild headache<br>      * Sneezing<br>      * Watery eyes<br>      * Low-grade fever (up to 102 F, or 39 C)<br>      * Mild fatigue<br>  <br>  The discharge from your nose may become thicker and yellow or green in color as a common cold runs its course. What makes a cold different from other viral infections is that you generally won't have a high fever. You're also unlikely to experience significant fatigue from a common cold. When to see a doctor<br>  For adults — Seek medical attention if you have:<br>  <br>      * Fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher<br>      * High fever accompanied by achiness and fatigue<br>      * Fever accompanied by sweating, chills and a cough with colored phlegm<br>      * Significantly swollen glands<br>      * Severe sinus pain<br>  There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and re|`|xdYX9DLCaa	a cold but if your higher than 100 degrees than it might turn into a flu....i had flu last week >.<|`|osoTq2dcaa	a cold ... but it sounds like it might turn into a sinus infection ... my sister just went to the doctor for this yesterday

vR4oTlKAaa	Ok you need to stop the three times a day muscle building workout and do it either in the morning or evening once a day. Your body has to repair the muscles that are straining to do this workout and if you workout several times a day you dont give your muscles what they need to heal and you keep tearing them down instead of building them up. You have to keep up protein if your dieting and trying to build muscle . That is  a pretty severe regimen.

Once you wear it more, it WILL get easier, believe me!<br>  <br>  You need to continue to wear the retainer as long as the dentist says to - or else all your hard work in wearing the braces will be wasted - the retainer keeps your teeth where they should be once the braces are off - if you don't wear the retainer, your teeth WILL move, not back to their original position, but they will drift. <br>  <br>  Keep wearing the retainer - you don't wear it to eat or drink, so that gives you some time off. <br>  <br>  Remember how weird it was when you first had the braces put on - it took you a while to get used to those didn't it?

3YJe5Z4Faa	Maxalt MLT is a prescription medication for migraines; the tablets dissolve under the tongue.

If you haven't already been checked out by a doctor for possible health problems causing the migraines, I would suggest doing so. Even the smallest non-malignant tumors can cause a great deal of pain (meaning non-cancerous tumors). Hormones can also cause migraine, and if you are entering puberty or exiting your prime (menapause for women, after 40 for men) this can cause a load of symptoms. History of migraine is a big one as well, especially in women, so if your family has experienced such intense headaches frequently, this may be the reason and you can guess you will experience this for life. Woman especially experience migraines in a seasonal or pendulum like manner. The headaches will go away and come back in specific intervals of time (days, months, or even years). This has been proven to be connected with hormonal and chemical changes in the body that just happen to occur with the individual during a specific time. You may also have an eye problem, so you may want to go to an eye doctor *a real optometrist not a sears or walmart eye care person. You may need your prescription changed, need glasses, or have a problem with the actual workings of your eyes. <br>  <br>  My family has migraines frequently and here are a few non-medicated tips that might help. <br>  1 dark room with no noise<br>  2 something tightly wrapped around the head. My grandmother used to use a hot wet towel and wrap it tightly around her head. Also hot compresses in general as well as hot baths. <br>  3 no caffeine, no cold liquids, only hot teas or hot lemon water during painful times. <br>  <br>  To prevent migraines<br>  Caffeine should also be avoided when possible. And you should avoid having bright lights in your home. Lamp shades and 60watt bulbs should be your best friend. Make sure the lighting isn't too dark either when you need it (such as when reading). <br>  Computer screens can also be the culprit. If your job involves long term computer use, buy one of those screens that fit over them that reduces glare and makes it easier on your eyes. <br>  Take frequent breaks from any long periods of reading, tv, or computer use.<br>  <br>  Ok...now I can recommend that if you do all these things and still get these intense headaches, try valerian tincture. It can be found in health food stores and sometimes certain pharmacies like walgreens. If you can't find the tincture, you can buy the capsules and break them open and mix them with applesauce. <br>  For tincture start by taking 1/2 teaspoon 1-2 times a day and you can increase it to a full teaspoon if necessary<br>  For capsules don't take more than 250 mg or it will become a sedative. Start off with 150mg 1-2 times a day.<br>  <br>  Lower doses of this is used for stress, migraine, hypertension and nervous stomach. Higher doses are used for muscle spasms, insomnia, restlessness, and also work well for migraine if you want to fall asleep too. If you wish to take valerian before bed, the capsules can be taken 300-500mg. Again, break open the capsules and mix it with applesauce or honey. Drink hot water or tea afterward to get it into your bloodstream faster and more efficiently. <br>  <br>  I suggest valerian because it lowers blood pressure (which will help lower the pain), it releases tension and relaxes spasms (which will also help), and it reduces pain directly. It is a natural herb, which means if you must take it for the rest of your life it will not do any damage to your liver *as tylenol would, or your harm your body as other pain relievers can. Valerian causes no dependency. Just don't take it with narcotics, sedatives or pentobarbitals. It works by relaxing your central nervous system and increasing your vascular circulation.<br>  <br>  choose valerian with .8% valerenic acid for the best quality.|`|RQ7utEMBaa	You can get some stuff by liquid, but have to take more of it as it is made mostly for kids.<br>  <br>  try slipping a pill into a spoon of applesauce and swallow the whole thing. the applesauce is not as liquidy as water and will mask the feeling of a pill going down. you really have to get used to taking pills. I suffer from Migraines and don't know where I'd be without Excederine Migraine . Try it. they're amazing.

But her risk of getting orally infected by oral sex with you is just about zero.  First, she probably is immune to catching the same strain of the virus she is already carrying at a new body site.  Second, even if you have been infected, the odds are good your immune system has cleared it up and you no longer carry the virus.  Third, oral warts are almost never seen except in people with advanced immune deficiency (e.g., AIDS).

It may not be great to get HPV--but there's at least that silver lining.<br>  <br>  If you go there you can read the BB and ask questions...good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  EWWWW....warts with oral sex???|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	If one of the person has HPV already, and the other person has a cut in their mouth, then the chances are really high, considering sperm and precum contains HPV.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	absolutely. it's spread through a skin-to-skin direct contact with a person infected by it|`|XkWd08Uvaa	please read www.raysahelican.com/hpvviral--www.rrpwe...|`|niwq7mvKaa	Yes and it's ugly|`|jLLkSWyiaa	yea
3YJe5Z4Faa	Obstructions can be missed by plain xray while abdominal CT is nearly 100% accurate in diagnosing it.  The trouble is that abdominal CT is a pretty hefty blast of radiation (a LOT more than abdominal xrays) and therefore doctors will try to avoid doing this test to the same patient over and over again... each additional test increases the radiation burden and therefore the risk of subsequent cancer.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a doctor will take a history and do a physical and be of the opinion that an obstruction is unlikely... in this case, abdominal xrays might be used as a form of doublecheck that's relatively safe to the patient.  If these also don't suggest obstruction then it's reasonable to reassure the patient and, at the same time, advise the patient to return for re-evaluation if things get worse.<br>  <br>  One last thing - from the point of view of obstructions, plain xrays can be read as "normal" "nonspecific" or "obstruction".  If the xrays are read as "normal" then it's quite unlikely that there is obstruction.  If the xrays are read as "nonspecific" then it is possible that there is obstruction that would only be seen on CT scan.  If they're read as "obstruction" then, of course, it means there's an obstruction.  It is possible that your xrays were read as "normal" which would make the doctor even more confident that there wasn't bowel obstruction and that CT scan was not required.
uVMlNvLoaa	If it is a UTI, I HIGHLY suggest that you see a doctor and get some antibiotics! If you do not treat the infection, it spreads up your urinary tract and gives you a kidney infection, which is life threatening and extremely painful (I've had one before--it requires hospitalization).<br>  <br>  Tell you parents that it is imperative that you see a doctor right now to do a urine test. If you are -bleeding- from your urethra and not your uterus, you might have an even more serious problem. Borrow some money, or something, because you don't want to mess around with this.|`|qog0Yd72aa	How are you so sure its not your period?<br>  i bet it is but you just dont think so. i promise you will be fine.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	You need to go on google and find a free clinic in your area and get yourself checked out ASAP if you are sure it's not your period and you would know better than anyone if it was. It could be an UTI. Also, I have to ask: are you intimate with your boyfriend? I only ask because it is also possible that you could have a ectopic pregnancy. <br>  God Bless.|`|v0UuWJSSaa	If its an infection, you NEED to get antibiotics, The urinary track infection go move to your kidney and become life threatning.

Bdu0hZcsaa	Hello  Tony.  I 've taken prozac, and i found it takes about 3 to 4 weeks for it to work.  When it does work, it really does lift your mood and you feel much calmer.  There is a lot of bad press about it, but my philosophy is if you feel miserable, take something and all doctors will tell  you if it is monitored then its fine to take. Dont pay attention to all the people who say medication is bad, its not bad if taken properly and if you are talking about your problems aswell.  I wish you the best of luck and hope you feel much better soon.  I'm sure you will.|`|eC8FNv3paa	they make you not feel happy or sad its weird then i felt like killing myself so i don't think there that great, but they work for some other people i know who that them, they can take up to 6 weeks to start working just don't drink to much on them,|`|fNgv2FeRaa	I've been taking all different medication for 15 years and nothing has worked..the symptoms of the medication have always been really bad so now I gave up taking any.<br>  <br>  Try them see how you feel.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It works for some people. If you don't feel better in a week or two, call the doctor and try an increased dose for a few weeks (ask him how long it should be before you notice a difference). If that doesn't work, then try another prescription and go thru the same process. It's totally trial and error. One way to decrease the trial and error is to tell the doc what drugs did and did not work for immediate family members, if they have also had depression.  Weird you were inpatient for only moderate depression - in the states, you have to be planning suicide or wildly psychotic to go inpatient.  Also, see a therapist - research shows that the combo of drugs and therapy are far more effective than either by themselves.  A few people have to add other meds on with their antidepressants to get them to work better. Also, you could really have bipolar disorder and not major depression, and if the diagnosis is wrong, you will be getting the wrong treatment. At age 21, you may not have had a manic episode yet, but still have bipolar, or maybe you only get hypomania. Also, if you have been emotionally or sexaully abused, prozac won't completely plaster over those problems - you will really need therapy.|`|E8Z5PWmcaa	I just left you an answer to your other question lol, but i need these points to ask one of my own! :)<br>  Cheers Midge
UNNl0sN1aa	yeah if u cry after sex i guess its because you just let your feelings go while sex an your emotions star floating around .... which means it was some pretty good sex i believe :)|`|tADSxyqwaa	YES! its all about strong emotions. when you dont know how to express them they tend to blurt out in an embarrassing (and for me, snotty) laugh/cry combo|`|Px8urrAuaa	Haha. Kind of.<br>  The first time I had sex, I cried because I was hurting, but my boyfriend is THE HUGEST clown, and always jokes about things. I was probably laughing out of sheer embarrassment, also...
2c726775df1bee382684b2b2b4d3e248aa	I have had this since I was in my 20's and it is only recently that it has really been a problem (I'm now a pensioner) apart from a few acute episodes over the years when I have herniated discs in my neck and lower spine.  I find that two "Co-codamol" capsules help (500 gm paracetamol and codeine).  It is also important to exercise carefully, swimming is great as it takes the weight off of your spine and you have to be extra careful when bending and lifting anything heavy - it is very important to remember to bend your knees, not your back.  If you have probems find yourself a good osteopath or chiropractor for advice and treatment. Hope this helps and good luck for the future.|`|zLK1iWXbaa	A diet could bring remedy to your pain…check it out here.|`|etPa1fbUaa	One cod liver oil capsule per day is very good and get off any statins you maybe on .change them for another type.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	It just means normal wear and tear arthritis.<br>  Do you have it all over, or only in one area?<br>  Did you do serious sports when you were younger, have a very strenuous job, or have an accident or injury?

Also you cant eat that every single day! Because what is  going to happen when your done with your diet?? Try thinking big and changing your life style by eating healthier period. It is VERY difficult to limit yourself to a certain menu every single day.Try eating a lot of white rice, vege stir frys, avoid sodas, eat lean meats, google delicious low fat/calorie recipes and eat plenty of fruit! There are many alternatives to loose weight than sticking to a bland meal plan! I commend you on your dedication!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yK58oehFaa	WOW! It's superb!

Be happy with your height. If you are overweight than exercise and lose it. Growing taller will make you gain weight anyways.|`|AA11447210	Sorry honey, there is nothing you can do to naturally cause yourself to grow any taller than your body is already preprogrammed to grow.<br>  <br>  A healthy diet, and good fitness regime, will help ensure you reach your maximum potential, but that's the best that can occur. It is very unlikely you're going to grow much more before it's time for you to stop, and 5" is out of the question. Sorry.
GLOBmh0Baa	It depends. Most girls stop growing by about the age of 18. Like every other human trait the age at which growth plates fuse follows the normal curve (or bell curve). When your growth plates fuse you are finished growing.|`|e5f0c993dc43986b75d483b1ea872bc2aa	Most girls stop growing shortly after getting their period.  Height usually stops between 14 and 17.  Your body can still change a bit until you are about 25yrs old.  Like breast can still be developing for awhile. Your hips and waist may change and your facial features will look more grown up. Nobody is the same and this is just a generalization.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	It is partly genetics and partly physical exercise.

Q5PwNDHXaa	to be honest, i would have to say you have already gotten some good answers. a common response to sexual abuse is promiscuity, however, i wouldn't see the harm in making it the other way around in your novel. i'm sure it's the case that people are sometimes much more uncomfortable engaging in sexual activity after such a traumatizing experience. so yeah, go for it. best of luck, hope the novel turns out great.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Actually, he would be more likely to be extremely promiscuous with girls but not be able to have an emotional connection.|`|lITolEVJaa	it depends on the person and how old they are, but most likely, they will never be able to have a real relationship because they are always going to think about that one time if they are old enough to remember. Every time it happens they will think about it and won't be able to be with that girl and it pretty much just ends up ruining their relationship life. Child molestation is sick and wrong and who ever commits it should be caught and put away for a LONG time.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	"Actually, he would be more likely to be extremely promiscuous with girls but not be able to have an emotional connection."<br>  <br>  That is the best answer because to me that is the common occurrance. Victims of child abuse can develop a wide range of other emotional or mental behaviours though some more uncommon than others. So could your story be realistic, it is possible. Best thing to do when beginning to write a story is to do as much homework as possible until you feel comfortable enough on the subject to write from experience.|`|4yrqRS4qaa	it depends on the person and the experience they had with the abuse. <br>  some ppl go towards sexual addiction. the drive overrides the connection with the girl. sometimes there is a resistance it is difficult. trust, touch, staying present and not being triggered into a flashback all makes intimacy frightening. it is not unusual for drugs or alc to be used to help numb the difficulty and for some ppl needed to be able to approach sex at all.<br>  email if you want<br>  malesurvivor.org is something you may want to check out.|`|r2bbLMUZaa	Motion seconded for the fourth time. 2 POINTS!!|`|nyeYS0Seaa	agree with above.|`|M8ImbhM3aa	In short, no.<br>  <br>  I'm making a documentary on a victim of sexual abuse and how she operates in relationships as an adult.  Through making the movie, I did plenty of research on the subject concerning both male and females.  While there are trends, each case is different.  <br>  <br>  One of those trends is sexual promiscuity.  Sometimes it seems that the victim tends to place less importance on sexual acts in general and therefore has a more cavalier approach to sex.|`|9240749c186cc50485fb8fcbe650e163aa	I had a sicko brother and unbeknown to me he was being molested by this sicko picture taking pervert who never was convicted (he  molested many of the latino boys in the neighborhood) <br>  My brother continued this molesting activity with younger children and even molested kids at a camp where he became a counselor (nobody complained) he married a 35 year old woman to keep an eye on the two boys he molested at camp he later had two children by this woman who died of cervical cancer and he molested these children till they were 15 and 17 years old.<br>  He was arrested because he started to molest his two other children with his group home wife of 8 years. Non of the charges ever stuck but <br>  He never was convicted because the girl recanted and the boy ran away.<br>  He died three years later from a drug overdose, he was Bipolar and a sociopath.<br>  In regards to fear I do not think it is fear, I feel it is control of  feeling empowered and it can be used for any age. I think it depends how easy you can manipulate the mental state of the person, chronological age does not matter.<br>  Not all children of sexual abuse become perpetrators but they have a higher chance.<br>  I have noticed that in several barrios in Orange County there is always a local pervert who molested many of the boys which in turn they have become criminals, murderers and committed suicide.|`|f6bmh5oTaa	listen to the first one and then the ones who agree with the top one alswell|`|ndt6HlsTaa	2 points for agreeing with the first one, yahoo! pun intended|`|zxXzJH09aa	yea what she said ^^^^^^^^^^^
EoroQbCraa	Yeah, but it can go either way.  He can be either afraid to do so, because of past experiences, or he can be over-eager to do so.  Trust me....I am one of those girls who was raped at age 10 by my father and older brothers....  I sort of got over it, but now I am scare to so much as even talk to teenage boys - - let alone older guys.  I'm working on that problem...but it's not easy.  So yeah, to answer your question, yes, I guess, but it can also be an extreme opposite of your topic.  Good luck with your book!|`|8d42ow2Raa	Having sex at an early age is scary for anyone, but can be worse if you have been molested.  I was first molested when I was 4 by a stranger, and then for years by a family member and friend of the family.  But as I got older I had it in my head that sex was the only way to please a guy and did so for many years.  At 14 I got pregnant by a 22 year old man and became a mom a month after I turned 15.  I am now married and have been for 9 years and I now know that sex is not bad and have learned to love it.  So I guess I am just trying to show that with some they become fearful and others use it as fuel to feel normal.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	First of all, ANY person can be afraid to have sex at a young age, and it probably means they have a brain in their head considering all the possible negative consequences.<br>  But yes a peron who was abused could have trouble forming normal relations with people or trusing them emotionally.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	Absolutely, but it can be either extreme as mentioned in the other answers. I was raped and molested for 7 years, every night . I am now a grandma and still have problems with sex. This can last all your life without help when it happened and you should never be blammed as I was. I was 11, I didn't know what sex was but I was blammed for "allowing" it to happen. The man was much bigger and older than I was, how could it have been my fault? Never blame a rape victim, rape is something they never forget, they shouldn't have to try to overcome blame as well.
BTI0XOptaa	Here are 4 different head lice prevention methods with Tea Tree Oil:<br>  <br>  1. Mix 10 drops of Tea Tree oil in with her shampoo. This will make her totally invisible to the lice as they no longer regard her as human. As transferring to anything other than a human spells certain death, they are not even willing to take the chance. <br>  <br>  2. Put her hair up in a tight plait. Lice find it harder to get hold of hair that is well up and out of the way. Mist her hair with water in spray bottle and 10 drops of Tea Tree added. This will help to further repel them.<br>  <br>  3. It is possible to repel them by simulating dirty hair as this makes it hard for the lice to move around or attach their eggs. Gel is one way to simulate a dirty environment without the hair actually being dirty. Mix in a few drops of Tea Tree oil. This will be a double whammy as the lice will not think she is human as well as it being impossible for them to move around or attach their eggs.<br>  <br>  4..You can also get "leave in" conditioner which will do the same trick again. Add 10 drops of Tea Tree Oil and spray this over a tight plait every day.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following sites for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Do you have dogs or cats and let the kids lie around on the floor with them?<br>  I think that's a big factor sometimes.<br>  But talk to the other parents and try to figure out where it's coming from.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	shave there heads<br>  thats what they do to babies who get lice<br>  i had lice really bad and i was so tired of it i shaved my head<br>  its just that my hair is thick and even the best shampoo worked  but if there is one single nit that is still alive and hatches then you have them all over again|`|WzKrZoHQaa	You won't totally eradicate it, sadly.  People don't realise that bedding needs to be changed at same time the hair treatments are applied or the conditioner method used PLUS hairbrushers also washed.

At 18 to 20 if you are a computer attic and book worshiper you will need less calories. Where as if you are a cheerleader, athlete, and late night partier you may need more.<br>  <br>  Edit: For someone spending most of their time studying look for foods that are high in calories but low in all fats. A recomended serving of a wheat product is good when you are having your mind do much of the work for the day. If you are 100 to 120 pounds you should maintain around 1000 to 1400 calories. If you are 120 to 160 pounds, you should maintain 1200 to 1600 calories.|`|o6HB29o8aa	that depends on how tall you are and how much you weigh, but for average females its 1 200 - 1 400 per day

To loose one pound you need to burn 3500 calories. Try eating lots of fruits and veggies and less meat, carbs. and junk food in general. Start running or working out and getting a little more exercise in, even if it is parking at the back of the parking lot at stores. Lastly, get a larger pair of pants. You need to feel good about yourself to loose weight and be accepting of your body, don't let those pants that shrunk in the wash get your down!

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|AA11215737	If you sleep on your leg for a long LONG time the blood loss could have killed or damaged your nerve endings.  They'll grow back, don't worry.

I54KyS8Laa	Losing two stone would put you way underweight. Maybe a half stone, but that's all. It sounds like your problem is more that you are self conscious rather than being overweight. . Some grow out of self consciousness naturally by their late 20’s—some never grow out of it which is why I'd suggest you get a head-start by reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz (which I have no financial interests and a book that everyone should read at least once). If it seems too advanced, focus on the parts about self consciousness and being happy. <br>  <br>  Then make sure what you're eating is healthy. The following has helped a lot of others your age.<br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or a half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a>|`|3d1XRIzkaa	First thing, Quit drinking Soda Pop, even Diet Soda Pop. Start drinking water. Do not eat any candy. If you get hungry, eat some dry cereal, like Cheerios, dry Oatmeal cereal, or Special K. When you eat your meals, take small portions, and eat your food slow. While chewing your food, put your fork down on the table. When you feel full, get up from the table and walk away, or you will over eat.

You should make an appointment with a GI Doctor (Gastrointernologoist). They will help you regulate your bathroom schedule alot better.

Mirilax is an over the counter product that will help regulate you if you want to try it yourself, but I reccommend the GI dr.
3YJe5Z4Faa	The patient is placed on their left side lying down.  The idea is that lying down helps get more blood to the brain since the heart doesn't have to work against gravity to get the blood to the brain.<br>  <br>  The reason for lying on the left side is that the left lung is smaller than the right lung so if the patient vomits and breathes their vomit in, it'll only end up in the left lung and the larger right lung will be spared.

This went on for a long time at which one point I honestly thought I might have some kind of cancer.  I went to the doctor and after he checked everything he put me on Ativan(nerve pill)  The symptoms went away as long as I took the meds.  I finally found another job and I went off the nerve pills.  I have not had those symptoms since then.  I am happy in my new job.  BTW:  Don't believe all the crap Wal-Mart says about being family oriented or they take care of their employees.  It is all b.s.

TsjqzanQaa	Obviously you haven't heard about the adverse effects and complications that can and do result from circumcision, which is male genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  I'm quite the opposite; I have gone from being circumcised, to UN-circumcising myself by foreskin restoration.<br>  <br>  The damage inflicted on me when circumcision was forced on me as an infant caused more than the usual (50-75%) loss of sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  I didn't know what was wrong with me for years, and finally found out about foreskin restoration.       <br>  <br>  Having a foreskin, even a restored one, is 1,000 times better than being circumcised and mutilated.       <br>  <br>  In circumcision, the foreskin with its thousands of nerve endings is amputated, nerves and nerve endings on the penis are damaged, veins, capillaries and blood vessels are severed, permanently disrupting the normal penile blood flow.        <br>  <br>  Scar tissue is formed, and the glans and surrounding tissues meant by nature to be covered by the foreskin dry out and keratinize, and all of these combine to destroy sexual sensitivity.       The keratinization continues throughout the victim's lifetime, and the remaining sensitivity slowly and inexorably continues to decline.<br>  <br>  In addition, the foreskin has Langerhans cells.      These cells have antiviral and antibacterial properties, which is why circumcised males have a much higher rate of HIV infection than uncircumcised men.<br>  <br>  This has been proven by the fact that, in the US, when 80% of males were circumcised, the HIV rate was much higher than in any of the other countries in Europe, South America, Scandinavia and Asia where males are rarely mutilated by circumcision.      <br>  <br>  Pakistan, for example, where more than 90% of males are circumcised, has an HIV rate 400% higher than that of India, where the vast majority of men are uncircumcised.      <br>  <br>  Doctors do not disclose the adverse effects and complications that can and do result from circumcision.      They make money from it, and are very frequently members of the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  Doctors NEVER discuss the issue of reduced sexual sensitivity, nor the psychological damage done to individuals by this atrocity.<br>  <br>  Before you become another victim of circumcision, I suggest that you visit the site CIRCUMSTITIONS, and find out just what the real drawbacks are.<br>  <br>  Very, very few men ever choose to be circumcised.     Almost all males who are circumcised had it forced on them as infants, when they had no choice in the matter, and couldn't fight back against this assault.<br>  <br>  Being circumcised diminishes sexual sensitivity, and using a condom further diminishes the sensation of having sex.   <br>  <br>  My new foreskin doesn't replace the damaged and amputated nerve endings, but it has enhanced my sexual sensitity, ability and orgasms.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't give up my foreskin for ten million dollars!<br>  <br>  Obviously, anyone with intelligence can understand that a complete penis, natural and normal with a foreskin, feels and functions better than one that's been made partial, mutilated and scarred by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|E64juLwJaa	I had it done at age 23 and can tell you that you loose some sensitivity,but for the rest all gets better:sex has never been that good,<br>  Planets|`|AA11476749	I read an article at the Men's Health website that addresses the issue.

If you want a circumcision, by all means get it done while you are young and healthy. There are many benefits. Young guys who want to be "cut" almost invariably are very pleased with the result both visually and sexually. I had mine done at age 26 as a medical student. The experience was exhilarating and embarrassing and a lot of other things but it was not painful. I hated the erections at night which did hurt until I curled up into a ball and took the pressure off the stitches.<br>  Healing was very rapid and I was gently masturbating with lube in no time. I feel that sex is much better and more intense with longer orgasms. <br>  You are old enough to join a pro circumcision group and get some valuable information before you do anything. I should be pleased to give you the information if you don't mind hearing from me privately rather than in this setting. I am delighted that you are asking sensible questions about this very therapeutic procedure. Don't listen to gay slurs and thoughtless information that often appears on Answers. Good luck whatever your decision|`|CWcipoG7aa	I'm 37 and not circumcised and my wife loves it. Most American woman are brain washed thinking that uncircumcised men are not the norm when in fact we are the norm and being circumcised is a cosmetic and hygiene thing. <br>  <br>  Why are you contemplating whether or not to get circumcised?<br>  <br>  Being uncircumcised demands a little more hygiene and that's it! <br>  If you get circumcised be prepared to lose some sensitivity and pleasure while masturbating or having intercourse. Don't do it!<br>  <br>  Most woman will admit that once they get a hold of a guy who isn't circumcised they won't let him go due to the pleasure and feeling they get while having intercourse. <br>  <br>  Trust me dude, keep the foreskin!|`|qImMwhUHaa	What's the big deal??

But nothing big at all.

1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	If you are only going in for a UTI, then I highly doubt the doctor will ask you about potential STD's.

1dL6fU0Haa	For general fitness improvements a 60-85% of your maximum heart rate is a good range to see improvements.  If you are trying to improve your cardiovascular system, I would suggest training closer to 85% and for fat burning, keep your heart rate closer to the lower end of this range near 65%.<br>  Your maximum heart rate is estimated by a simple formula which you can apply.  Simply take the number 220 and subtract your age to find your estimated maximum heart rate.  Then multiply that by your desired target heart rate percentage.<br>  In your example, a 46 year old female looking to lose weight, you will want to exercise at a heart rate range of 65-70%.<br>  <br>  220-46=174 (maximum predicted heart rate range)<br>  174 x .65 = 113 (65% of maximum heart rate) <br>  174 x .70 = 122 (70% of maximum heart rate)<br>  <br>  In the example above, you will therefore want to keep your heart rate in the range of 113-122 beats per minute.  Most cardio machines come equipped with heart rate monitors that can provide you with quick and easy readings to ensure your ranges are met.  You may also want to wear a digitized heart rate monitor if exercising in the outdoors or you can easily check your own pulse with a 10-second count ( count how many beats you hear by pressing firmly against the front of your wrist for 10 seconds and multiply that by 6 to find out your beats per minute.<br>  <br>  If you find your heart rate is too slow, simply speed up or increase the intensity of your exercise or slow down if your heart rate is too high to maximize workout efficiency!

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them.

uVmwUqhIaa	As of right now, your problem is a result of constant irritation. Stop removing your gauges. Leave them in so that your ears are able to heal and adjust to the stretching. Clean your ears with a sea salt soak as Ray suggested, or diluted Dial soap. Do not use both. If using the soak, simply soak your ear in a cup of sea salt and water. If using Dial, wet a q-tip, dab it lightly on a bar of Dial and clean your piercing gently. Use another wet q-tip to wash away the Dial. After cleaning, spray your ears with Bactine. This will help fight current infection and prevent future infection. Never use peroxide or alcohol on piercings. Both are inappropriate and can be damaging to surrounding tissue. Plus the body already produces its own supply of peroxide when fighting infection. Your infection should clear up. If not, consult a local nurse help line.|`|xRvetiAMaa	Dab cotton with hydrogen peroxide on it to the wound. Let 'bubble', wipe, repeat three times. Keep clean with plain soap and water thereafter.<br>  <br>  If not better in 7 days, time to see a nurse Practitioner or MD.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Always leave them in to clean them. You should never take out a healing piercing to clean it, even if it's a stretch. That would open the hole to bacteria. Leave them in, and soak your earlobe in a sea salt mixture of 1/4tsp sea salt to 8oz boiled water (and let it cool a bit of course.,. should still be warm). Should clear up in a few days. If the infection doesn't go away, go see your piercer and they'll tell you what to use. You may have to downsize but you won't have to take them out. <br>  Downsizing is no big deal anyways.

GjtIXiK9aa	Once contracted, coldsores (herpes simplex) is a virus which you carry lifelong, living in the ganglion nerve tissue (usually in your temple - i.e. the side of your head).  There is no known cure.  While latent, it is possible to pass the infection on through any body fluid or open wound, although less likely than in an active phase.  You would have to have touched the wound with a similar wound or bodily fluid of your own to allow transference, though.<br>  <br>  Herpes simplex is not always 'just a coldsore' - it can even be passed on to an unborn child, and can cause encephalitis, certain types of meningitis or even raise the odds of getting Alzheimers in certain genetic make-ups.

3QIWdvG1aa	Initially, the flu may seem like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu.<br>  <br>  Common signs and symptoms of the flu include:<br>  <br>      * Fever over 101 F (38 C) in adults, and often as high as 103 to 105 F (39.5 C to 40.5 C) in children<br>      * Chills and sweats<br>      * Headache<br>      * Dry cough<br>      * Muscular aches and pains, especially in your back, arms and legs<br>      * Fatigue and weakness<br>      * Nasal congestion<br>      * Loss of appetite<br>      * Diarrhea and vomiting in children<br>  <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away. Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness by a day or two and may help prevent more serious problems. Seek immediate medical care if you have signs and symptoms of pneumonia. These include a severe cough that brings up phlegm, a high fever and a sharp pain when you breathe deeply. If you have bacterial pneumonia, you'll need treatment with antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant wome|`|uFT0k30Kaa	Muscle Aches (back muscles and leg muscles)<br>  Headache<br>  Fever (high) + 102<br>  Cough/Sneeze<br>  Weak<br>  <br>  Feel like you were hit by a mack truck|`|eBB9qJRxaa	Yoink!

If you had sex that first month without back up protaction you could be pregnant, also if you missed any pills you could be pregnant.  There are also a small percentage of people who get pregnant even when they use the pill correctly.  I would make sure you are not pregnant again before you start your next pill pack.  Better safe than sorry.|`|hFNqA23Maa	no you shouldn't be too concerned you should just rest or go see a doctor , that happened to my mom when she was having a little bro..

ZNbauLJzaa	You MUST speak to your doctor about this. If your doc did not explain how to handle low/high blood sugar then he/she is not doing their job properly.  Are you seeing and endocrinologist?  If  not,  make an appt with one.  An endocrinologist has more knowledge about diabetes and can treat you better.<br>  <br>  For now, you can take glucose tablets, or drink juice to raise you blood sugar level.  If you are low frequently, your medication needs to be adjusted.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	You need a simple fast absorbed sugar--usually a juice box (orange etc) and some hard candy you can suck, a packet or two of raw sugar etc; which you should have a stash of at all times. You should act before you get to 50 however, if at all possible (which is why they should be close at hand at all times).  Getting to 50, is close to unconsciousness and damage to brain cells. If you are constantly hitting lows, you need to speak with your diabetic educator about diet plans & dosage modifications. Wide swings in blood sugar levels are not good for the body.|`|E8Z5PWmcaa	drink lukozade, if you get that low then you need really fast release sugar...lukozade is practically liquid glucose, so if you're really low  then its really good for getting your levels up. Then eat a slower acting carb like a sandwich or something, cus your levels will fall sharply again after the lukozade if you're not careful|`|R3yUkaCSaa	thats nothing i can run and play with that number. but just eat a couple gluclose tabs or crackers.
gkgN5PeBaa	the quick answer is that no that isn't a good work out.<br>  <br>  BUT, the fact that you're even in the gym is world's ahead of a lot of people like you that want to lose weight so congrats on that, you've already won half the better I think.<br>  <br>  The main mistake many people make is not weight training right away. Weight training will add muscle to your body (duh!), and that extra muscle means your body needs needs to burn more calories every day to keep that muscle on your body, meaning you will be burning more calories even as you're not working out.  this really boost your fat loss (plus you'll look great).<br>  <br>  If you're going to do weight training though you need a program to stick to, otherwise (and i've been there) you end up at the gym just wandering around and leaving after 20 min because you really don't know what you're doing. Big Mistake.  Find a program that you LIKE, and you feel motivated to start and complete. Then follow that program until its over (ideally 3-4 months)  and reassess your situation then. <br>  <br>  As for your cardio, I think you're doing waaay too much.  If you pick the right program you could do a great workout including weight training and cardio only 3x a week and I guarantee you'll get better results than you are now.   <br>  <br>  Just remember, whatever program you choose, make the commitment to stick with it to the end.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|t81MEJ82aa	You'll burn fat faster if you weight train. Your body needs energy to maintain and build muscle mass, thus you will burn more calories even when you are inactive. <br>  <br>  I don't think using 3 different cardio machines is necessary. Keep it to 1 or 2, then when it becames stale or your body adapts rotate 1 out and switch to another. At least not all in the same day. For example, treadmill + elliptical then perhaps rotate out the elliptical and add the stair master.<br>  <br>  Plus this is all assuming that you have a healthy diet.|`|1j7QLM7Saa	push ups sit ups broham|`|cNveRYTxaa	yeah that sounds great, but u cant keep doin the same thing all over and over, ur body will need different frequencies.. lets say, 2 miles and 15 mins stair on mon and wed... and 4 miles and 25 mins on a carido machine on tues n thurs..  something like that, you know the deal... <br>  <br>    but if its ur first time in a long time... start out easily and loose your muscles up first before you go crazy..

CEoT8pjqaa	You probably haven't started because of the stress.<br>  Try to chilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll...<br>  ^.^|`|tCmwFJn5aa	Sometimes, weight changes and stress will disturb your period cycle.  If you are not sexually active, you shouldn't worry about this month.  Sometimes young girls have delayed, irregular and missed periods.  This is normal.

Under 2 hours gatorade or better yet Heed is good.<br>  <br>  For example, if I ride 100 miles om my bicycle I will burn an estimated 6000 calories. I will need to have calories in my body and eat while riding so i don't 'bonk' that is your muscles just say Ive had enough and your stopping no matter how determined you are. <br>  <br>  If you are just going to the gym eat right all the time and no don't eat special just because you are about to go to the gym. eat right all the time.<br>  <br>  For endurance fuels try hammer nutrition on-line they are great IMO.<br>  <br>  The gym is filled with very strong and fat weight lifters. Try to find a better balance than the majority. Alot of weight lifters think they need much much more food to build muscle than they really do, Eat smart and maybe get a trainer who looks like what you want to look like.|`|obHa7Stuaa	Get some protein and complex carbs 1 to 1 1/2 hours before, IF your doing heavy lifting.<br>  <br>  If not, simple carbs (gatorade) will do fine while your working out.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Are you talking about cardiac catheterization or having a catheter inserted elsewhere like into your bladder?|`|I3CNklLKaa	It's a catheter and if you're a chap they poke a thin tube up your willy. If you are of the female gender they do the equivalent. This then saves you doing a wee for a while 'cos it goes automatically into a bag. It doesn't hurt or anything (although the bag is a bit of an encumbrance - especially when doing the cha-cha-cha).|`|SxHvknWMaa	Cardiac catheterization is used to diagnose and plan the treatment for many heart diseases. Catheterizations are frequently performed to measure the pressure within the heart’s chambers, collect samples of heart muscle, measure blood oxygen levels and blood flow in the heart’s chambers, and evaluate heart muscle pumping ability. This enables the cardiologist to access who how well the heart is function. During cardiac catheterization, x-ray images, called angiograms, are usually recorded to examine the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle. This is necessary to determine the need for bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stent placement.|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	Ah right. Erm..avoid if at all possible. It involves having a tube inserted up the old fella. I'm not sure if it goes all the way to the bladder or not but it's probably not best to find out.<br>  I had surgery last year and they threatened me with one as i was bed ridden, believe me I made a miraculous recovery and went to the piss house quick smart.|`|9EoV0ppmaa	Usually fitted up urine tube.

Cut out fatty foods like crips, biscuits. fizzy drinks and fried foods. Also excercise is essential, you can do lunges at home and sit ups or best thing go for a jog round the block.

Some grow out of self consciousness naturally by their late 20’s—some never grow out of it which is why I'd suggest you get a head-start by reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz (which I have no financial interests and a book that everyone should read at least once). <br>  <br>  And then after you gain some insights to self image psychology and later on want to build true self esteem so you can feel good about you even on a bad hair day or when you really make a big mistake or look clumsy or what ever, then take advantage of the references below. <br>  <br>  As far as what you eat--it's best to eat healthy and here are some tips that have helped many others. <br>  An egg with whole grain bread or a half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a><br>  <br>  Healthy eating,<br>  <br>  Richard K|`|jw6Lpt37aa	126lbs or 57.12kgs  this is ideal weight you don't need to lose weight you need to adjust the weight and firm your body and specially your waist and abs and that can be done with dancing or running for 30 minute daily and eating small snacks in between meals like carrots and cucumber or a small banana or an apple all this will make your stomach full most of the time and will get your belly flat and will tone all your body best of luck and enjoy your life|`|6UKd0Gedaa	thats a perfect weight|`|DgMFQRuHaa	What does eight stone mean?<br>  I'm fourteen and I weigh 115?<br>  I think I'm over weight but that's because I grew up with five anorexic family members.<br>  None weighing over 110.<br>  If I knew what you meant I'd help you out.<br>  But if you honestly think your over weight,<br>  I'd try exercising and what I've been doing is instead of snacking and eating a full lunch I eat yogurt.<br>  It's especially good with granola.<br>  But I still think were too young to be worrying about weight, <br>  I mean it's hard enough being our ages in the world today.<br>  Good luck.<br>  (:|`|CEoT8pjqaa	Hon you're not overweight.<br>  And besides, you're 13!

4GNNOQeLaa	All medications have certain side effects, depending on the drug or class of drugs.  Many antidepressants take a few weeks to a couple of months to take full effect and side effects like being tired are usually worse early on.  Some drugs work better than others and since you feel none of these have worked well for you, maybe something like Cymbalta might help since it works differently than these other drugs you have taken.  If you have tried all other options at least for a couple of months each and feel they are not an option try Cymbalta or talk to your Dr. about other options.  Goodluck.|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	Just Google It does have a point. Your depression could be situational. The drugs that you are given are meant to correct a biological chemical imbalance in the brain. If you do not have this imbalance then they aren't going to work. Sure you may feel numbness as a side effect or that numbness could also be from the depression itself. I don't know you so I cannot tell you exactly what's going on. I can only take  a guess. And being that I'm not a psych that's all I can do. Good luck. I hope you find something that works.out. <br>  <br>  <br>  Note: <br>  <br>  Have you ever considered trying therapy for your anger outbursts and to find the root cause of your depression? Just a thought.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	if you are having severe mood swings than you were probably misdiagnosed..other than that if it is depression from a particular situation that might cause it and no meds will work unless you remove yourself from the situation<br>  <br>  have a second opinion that might help especially if nothing is working|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Could your depression be situational?  Are you depressed because of your living situation, or because of illness (other than depression itself) or because of the loss of a loved one? <br>  <br>   In my experience, antidepressants do little to nothing to improve situational depression.  Don't needlessly dope yourself up, if you can help it.  Try changing something in your life instead, or seek counseling to help you find better ways of dealing with stressors and the negative things in your life.|`|2KC467tFaa	Try researching natural anti-depressants. They naturally work with your body unlike the chemicals that you're taking now. Prescription anti-depressants have been known to numb people, cause other health problems, and even cause more depression and suicidal feelings. If they worked with the body, there would be no side effects.|`|sbeoF50gaa	Try st. johns wort. I've heard it really works, plus it's natural. You can find it by the vitamines.

7TcxJqW4aa	Yes definetly. If you eat 1200 calories and burn 1400 you will definetly lose weight. Because you are burning more calories than you are taking in. But be careful! Your body needs some calories to survive! Try eating 1400 and burning 1400 this will still help you slim down, probably about 2lbs a week, which is healthy. You can look up tips and keep track of your calorie intake on this website called www.livestrong.com. You can also track your physical activity on that website and it'll keep track of how many more calories you can eat. <br>  <br>  Also if you are hoping to gain some muscle, be careful with eliminating all calories from your body. You need some calories to help with muscle production. So make sure you give your body the nutrients and food it needs.

5MvZ5EiXaa	Your story sounds so similar to mine that it's scary. I will be 21 next Wednesday (March 4th). I have also been using drugs since I was 16. Opiates are my drug of choice although I have tried pretty much everything except meth due to my stupid theory; "I'll try anything and everything atleast once." Not a very good theory to live by I have realized. I went from sniffing hydros/vicodin, morphine, oxy-cotton, ect. to shooting up heroin, morphine, oxy-cotton, kadian, ect. I always thought I had control of my addiction and that I control my drug use; that my drug use/addiction didn't control me. Well, I was wrong. I always told myself I would never stick a needle in my arm and that if I did I knew I had a problem and would seek help. I voluntarily admitted myself to an Outpatient Chemical Dependency Program just recently. I am not completely clean and sober by any means, but I am getting there. Opiate addiction is very serious and it is one of the hardest addictions to overcome and has some of the worst withdrawl symptoms. Opiate withdrawl usually only last a couple days to a week, but it is the cravings and "need" to use that is the hardest to cope with once the withdrawl symptoms have diminished. You have to have the will to want quit using, and the will-power to do it. You also have to be completely mentally, emotionally, and physically ready to quit using otherwise you will most-likely relapse, over and over. My advice to you is to do what you feel is right. Not everybody has to go to rehab, attend outpatient treatment or even meetings to become sober. Although, many, many people find it easier, and very helpful, and the outcome is usally good. My doctor did not want to put me on Methadone or Suboxone for withdrawl/cravings, ect. because he doesn't agree with using one drug to become sober from another drug consider both Methadone and Suboxone are highly addictive. But, if you do feel like you just cannot take the withdrawl symptoms you are experiencing you can go to your local emergency room, and they will monitor you, and help you through it and they can also give you advice on what to do or where to go for further assistance.<br>  I'm not sure if this is any help to you, but I read your question and became extremely interested and determined to give you as much information that I could.

N5mSDe1Naa	I can sympathize. I have a close family member who has recently started to show signs of anxiety and depression. He was always very social and charismatic and just a joy to be around. His father suffered from severe anxiety and now he is suffering immensely. His father knows and is not very helpful. Just wants to dope him up so he will not have to deal with the issue. I would like to let the other parent know what is going on, but the father is very much against it. <br>  <br>  I think his parents need to know on some level that your friend is not doing okay. It's easy to get wrapped up in your own life and not always see what is going on in your child's life. I would maybe tell your friend to see the school counselor or see if he could see his therapist more than once a week. If he is uncomfortable taking to his parents about the situation the counselor or therapist can perhaps bring the parents up to date about your friend.<br>  <br>  I can understand his concern with the meds. I have had friends who have taken them and some felt numb, others felt out of it and unable to react to life. This sounds strange, but maybe have him talk to a nutritionalist. I have a friend who started eating better and taking the right vitamins and it helped him a lot! He felt his depression wasn't on high gear and he felt better and not worse, like some of the meds can make you feel. <br>  <br>  Good luck. I understand how uncomfortable this situation can be.|`|zXazRsKzaa	If you think your friend might hurt himself, or somebody else immediately tell someone!!!<br>  <br>  If not just talk to him about how is feeling. Not wanting to take drugs for depression is very common, especially since in teens taking anti-depressants can sometimes make depression worse. He may have taken the drugs and had negative side-effects to them. <br>  <br>  If he is seeing a therapist he is most likely in good hands. However, if your friend really is seriously depressed try to talk to him about it. He obviously needs a friend right now. Ask him how badly depressed he feels today. And then ask what do you think would make you less depressed. <br>  <br>  It is 100% possible for him to get over this without taking drugs, but he needs to have people to talk to about his feelings. Support him, and make sure he knows how much you care about him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|5HFOYjCMaa	Ask him what makes him feel depressed.  If it's something situational such as over weight then yes he can curb his depression without drugs.  Exercising makes endorphines that will make him feel happier.  If his depression is something that he can't put his finger on then yes he needs medication...either way, it doesn't just go away on it's own.|`|479460cc8a083eaa121c7c4f99e95066aa	Oh, sweetheart, it is so easy.

Even though that may not always help right away it's a step. But if it really as deep as it seems then you probably have no choice but to tell his parents. you may not want to and i understand that it is hard. He may not liek you for doing so but it's for his best interest and you are after all a friend: someone who cares for his well being. hope this helps you on whatever you choose to do.<br>  <br>  cheers<br>  natalierose|`|LNnRSLdtaa	its normal to try <br>  but depression is caused by a lack of seratonin on the brain and thats hard to fix without medication<br>  <br>  dont tell his parents<br>  if you do that its such a breach of trust <br>  tell him he should tell his parents adn if he wont you just have to be there for him|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I will tell you i have taken a couple different depression things and they made me feel worse but then again it is different for everyone, i personally don't take anymore, i got better without them but like i said they may help some people, i don't know what to tell you but wish i did, good luck though....|`|GqTSa85daa	You can't beat true depression on your own.

yrBSkJKGaa	Mono is a viral infection that will remain in your body forever.  You  should try to take a full week off from work, and literally sleep the entire time.  Your body is craving it.  It also sounds like you are partying a bit on the weekend (up until 5am??).  You need to take a time out on the drinking and late nights for sure.

ARaAWXpjaa	Step1 Rest the bruised area. This permits the blood to clot more quickly, which limits the spread of blood beneath the skin. <br>  <br>  Step2 Apply a cold compress to the bruise'20 minutes on, 20 minutes off'as often as you can for the first day or two. The cold will constrict blood vessels and help keep the bruise from spreading. Never apply ice directly to the skin. Always use an ice pack or a cold compress. <br>  <br>  Step3 Avoid aspirin until the bruise has started to heal. Aspirin is an anticoagulant, which prevents blood from clotting as quickly. Blood that does not clot spreads more extensively underneath the skin. <br>  <br>  Step4 Take acetaminophen for pain. This does not affect clotting. <br>  <br>  Step5 Apply a warm, wet compress after the first 48 hours to reduce pain and swelling. Heat is recommended once the blood has stopped spreading around the bruise. Heat dilates blood vessels, which will help speed the sweeping away of blood cells from around the ruptured vessels.|`|629b2a254146ba15b3a5223b9513e6b0aa	yes, bruising is just bleeding under the skin, and the cold ice stops or slows the bleeding.|`|991d9dbadb757302092acf58552d5e65aa	Just make sure you follow the rule 15 min on, 15 min off.|`|xRvetiAMaa	First 24 hours of injury, icing it is perfect.

AA10248239	People of any age may need to use bifocals, although it's more common in older adults.  Most people adjust to them fairly quickly.  Just as with regular lenses, the world looks larger and clearer once youu finally have them on.|`|9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	Well it depends if the doctor said  you need a more old fashioned lined bifocal, or the more modern and popular progressive lens, which is a no life bifocal. If he recommends the lined one, there will be a line in your lens, visible to you and others. Above the line will be distance vision  - below the line is reading vision. You will have no intermediate (computer distance and such) in the lens.<br>  <br>  If he recommended a progressive, there is no line in the lens. It is essentially a no line TRIfocal, as you will have distance, intermediate and reading vision in this lens. It is very easy to adapt to (in fact, there is a higher non adapt rate in bifocals than in progressives), there's just a few things to keep in mind, like to hold your head back when you read and to point your nose toward what you reading rather than just scan your eyes. (The reason for this is that a progressive is the RX design is somewhat hourglass shape - so by not reading that way you may seem some distortion). <br>  <br>  It's uncommon but not unheard of for someone of your age to need bifocals or progressives - I've seen 8 year olds that need this too! <br>  <br>  Good luck and let me know if you have any other questions! =]|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	That would be unusual, but not impossible.<br>  The need for a bifocal or varifocal due to the eye losing it's natural adaptability (accommodation) with age cuts in on average at 45, for someone of European descent, but rather earlier for African and more so Asian ethnicities.  Even so, an Indian rarely needs a bifocal before 35. <br>  <br>  The other main legitimate reason to give a bifocal early is not to do with the vision, but if the eyes have a tendency to over-converge when reading, causing eyestrain or double vision.  There, reducing the focussing effort the eyes make can ease their alignment strains.<br>  Teenagers sometimes benefit from this.<br>  <br>  But I would never prescribe bifocals to your age group without doing a full cycloplegic Rx, to make sure there was no "hidden" long-sight (ciliary spasm) making it only appear that you need bifocals, when in fact it is a more +ve simple distance Rx that is required.  This means using eye drops similar to the dilating ones, but considerably stronger.<br>  <br>  If that hasn't been done, I'd be reluctant to accept a bifocal Rx without a very clear explanation of *why* it is necessary, which you don't appear to have hard.<br>  <br>  If necessary, they are not dreadful to get used to but again, that's their job to explain, not just give you a set of numbers and shove you out the door.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|Vk4mZi5Yaa	Everyone could loose a few pounds, just eat healthy & exercise!<br>  <br>  Im 5'6 & im 126 pounds but im a girl lol go on google and search BMI CHART & see if your in your ideal weight! x|`|yXr3O7uDaa	Hey!  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master cleanse" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.  She teased at me at first and I felt embarassed about it and she told me her secret on how she lost her weight.  She gave me a book entitled "Strip That Fat" - within a month I lost 18.3 lbs!<br>  <br>  I seriously recommend and urge you to learn more about this since it has helped me a lot - it demystifies false beliefs like low fat diet, eating low carbs and such help you!  <br>  <br>  Learn the real truth:<br>  www.Strip-That-Fat.tk|`|Bh3QeLaoaa	Could you? of course. <br>  Should you? no.
3f051d1522659b9e1c4844497c5a4e90aa	Maybe you are really not used to it. Not talking to your boyfriend, makes you feel uncomfortable, gives you a lot of questions about him such as 'is he okay, does he love me of course he does, is he angry?'. <br>  <br>  I believe you may learn how to communicate with friends at the same time you're talking to your bf. Also learn how to spend time with your friends and your boyfriend equally[talking on phone,msn,emails, etc]. I know you don't see him a lot but try act like you guys are having a normal relationship.<br>  <br>  Learn how to cope with it, of course you're learning it! It will give you a lesson of how to cope not talking with people you really love, and to accept in your heart that you absolutely understand that he needs space. <br>  <br>  You just love him so much, and you care about him. That is a true girlfriend. If you weren't, you would be:<br>  1)breaking up with him<br>  2)not caring about anyone esp him.<br>  3)doing something like having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  But you're not like that person, are you? He knows you love him, if he does not, well! he should! When you guys can talk, make sure that he understands that you're there for him, you care for him, and love him with your heart. Tell him how you felt, and he should able to let you know how he felt when he was not talking to you.<br>  <br>  It's better for you and him to have own space otherwise you both would end up taking anger on each other and breaking up. It would hurt like hell if you were still talking to him. <br>  <br>  You just got to learn how to accept that not talking to someone for a few days are absolutely fine. If it was for months, nah that's not okay. Do something about it though.  <br>  <br>  Try find something you can focus, such as watching films you love, read magazines? books? go to clothes shopping by your self, don't sit on the chair yahoo answering! he he! You will do those things in the future if it happens to you again. <br>  <br>  Again, it's better to have own space rather than both being clingy!|`|RwStCt82aa	You are young, and i know you probably dont want to hear this, but you shouldnt waste your time with a relationship that hurts you this much.

I know it may sound rough but if you find somebody else that does worse (mental, sexual or verbal abuse you) and you feel like you need him therefore letting him not to be lonely then it can turn into a real problem. <br>  Do things for you...

g9EnLhaPaa	I am betting you roommates are skinny, and have never had to lose weight in their entire lives.  <br>  <br>  You are absolutely correct in training abs to avoid underdeveloped core strength.  You are also on the right track doing full body workouts instead of a split (EG: Chest/Tri's monday, Back/Bi's Tuesday).  Splits are for muscle gain, and isolation.<br>  <br>  It is also correct to do abs on your cardio day.  Do it before your cardio workout.  However if you are a beginner DO NOT go from ab workout to ab workout with little/no rest.  I would recommend 60-90 seconds between your sets.  If you are a beginner and do a circuit training style regime w/abs right off the bat you will end up injuring your lower back and neck.  Make sure your hands are at the sides of your head NOT behind your neck.<br>  <br>  If you do not do abs or lower back at all, you risk injury doing other workouts (Squats, Dead Lifts, Pull-Overs).  Any lifting movement that involves the abs as a secondary support group will suffer.  Good luck!|`|mlaLgoaSaa	Your roommates are wrong. Keep working on your core. Any strength training will help. Muscle burns fat! The more lean muscle tissue you have, the faster you will burn fat. Crunches are an awesome way to strengthen your core. keep it up! Hope this helps!|`|zu0W6hCTaa	The crunches wont help u lose weight, but it will build muscle in ur abs. The more muscle ur body has the more calories ur body burns. So cardio along with ab workouts will be effective. Also u need to vary the type of exercise u do for the abs, dont just do crunches.  Understand that the midsection will be the last thing to go, its gonna take hard work and time. U need to have under like 10% BMI to even have any visible abs.|`|XQJg3RNTaa	Thats right, you should do cardio after you do abs and use the abs as a warmup. <br>  <br>  Every calorie you burn is a calorie you lose so working your abs can only help you lose weight, but a correct ab routine only take 5-7 minutes, only a few times a week, you should be moving very fast during this routine and resting very little, which will also help you lose weight. I always go for a short run after any lift just to burn an extra few calories and drive the point home, it's not fun but it gets the job done.<br>  <br>  In addition, Muscle mass consumes calories all day long, even while you sleep, the more muscle you have the more it will pick up some mistakes in your diet for you so don't drop strength training.<br>  <br>  if you want to lose more weight through lifting you need to decrease your rest, I never rest more than 30sec. and never more than 1min. between lifts.|`|04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	Doing cardio is great for burning calories, but it only burns them WHILE you are doing the cardio.  Doing other things, like weight training and crunches for the abs, burn calories long after you're done, because you are building muscle.  Muscle helps to burn fat, so don't skip the abs, but don't skip the cardio either. It all pays off in the long run.|`|jPf2TMgLaa	well, theres nothing bad about ab workouts, i used to do loads, it works the core muscles. ive stopped doing them now.<br>  but actually running works alot of ur body, including ur abs! <br>  i lost more 'tummy' from running them anything else, and i think its just better overall exercise...|`|0vlVkSE1aa	Cardio gets rid of the overall fat, but you still want to focus on your core muscles as well. Your roommates may have meant that just doing abs is not going to work.<br>  <br>  You need to incorporate weight training as well.|`|2UnjeOQUaa	Abs definitely need to be worked in there somewhere but it is true it is not the best way if you are first trying to lose weight.

Because you had to ask the question might mean that you are self conscious as most teenagers are. Some grow out of self consciousness naturally by their late 20’s—some never grow out of it which is why I'd suggest you get a head-start by reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz (which I have no financial interests and a book that everyone should read at least once). Focus on the parts about self consciousness and being happy. <br>  <br>  And then after you gain some insights to self image psychology and later on want to build true self esteem so you can feel good about you even on a bad hair day or when you really make a big mistake or look clumsy or what ever, then take advantage of the references below. <br>  <br>  Have a Great Year of Self Discovery<br>  <br>  Richard K|`|imziSPonaa	You have to burn 3500 more calories then you take in to lose one pound.

nDHzrfvSaa	Maybe U need to get Urself tested.is it that U are involved in some strenous activity or something lately??maybe Ur hunger is resultant of that.try this trick for a few days-have a big breakfast..U know,Oats,milk,fruits,etc.Fill Urself up really nicely in the morning. Have a moderate lunch so that U don't end up dozing in the afternoon.have the lightest possible dinner and pack up urself for bed having lots of water so that U don't snack in the night.this will also enable U to be hungry in the morning and have a good breakfast.if U feel hungry in the middle,have a glass or two of water.we tend to misinterpret our thirst for hunger.if U are really hungry,instead of snacking on biscuits or some junk food,choose grapes,orange or a simple sandwich.That fills U up in the true sense and is nutritious too.<br>  <br>  There is another possibility though..Maybe U have some problem,something deep.Don't mind me saying this please...Maybe U are mixing up Ur emotions and feelings with food.Think it out.Ponder it within Urself.U will find the solution.if it is not that way,try those things i've suggested.they've worked for me..<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	It sounds like your hungry.

lPdCTyOAaa	"TMJ" stands for Temporomandibular Joint.  In fact, you have two of them.<br>  <br>  I know that's not what you meant, but what you have is Temporomandibular Joint Disorder or Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome.    Simply referring to it as "TMJ" is something of a pet peeve, as it is an imprecise and incorrectly applied abbreviation.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you can leave it behind you is dependent upon several factors.  One is the extent of damage in the joint, one is the ability of your own body to adjust, one is the skill of your dentist/doctor/therapist, and finally there is your own compliance with your treatment programs.<br>  <br>  There are many ways TMD can be treated...none of us can know which combination (if any) will work for you.  But it is at least theoretically possible that one can fully get over TMD.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NPpalf1Gaa	I have TMJ.<br>  <br>  TMJ is usually only treatable with surgery because it is your actual bones and not just your teeth. Definitely follow through with your dentist and ask him or her to refer you to a facial or oral surgeon. This pain will not simply go away on it's own but infact gets worth with time because you are straining those joints and this could eventually lead to lock jaw. I'm having a surgery to correct TMJ called orthognathic surgery, however it is very expensive and takes your surgeon about a year to find out the exact measurements your jaw(s) should be moved, perform x-rays, and complete the braces which is mandatory even if you've already had them. Also talk to him or her what hospital they will perform the surgery and go to that hospital's financial aid/assistance building for ways to help with the money portion. <br>  <br>  It use to hurt so bad when I chewed my food and sometimes my joints would ache and it even popped when I yawned.. which is not good. However, I hopefully will have the surgery during the summer to correct it!<br>  <br>  To learn more about the surgery, go to google, yahoo, or youtube and search "Orthognathic surgery."<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Its better to be aware of it and catch it quick then too late as long as you do not become obsessed by it.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	I had an infection in my surgery incision and had a lump come up behind my ear, right on the bone ridge. It was just a lymph gland. Swollen glands come and go and I wouldn't worry too much about it.|`|XQIbx7Plaa	Cancerous tumors appear as painless lumps a lot of the time.  I think that it is a very legitimate concern of yours.  I think that it is unprofessional for your physician to dismiss your concern, because that is what they are there for, to help with our individual health concerns.<br>  I would suggest you first check out your insurance plan and make sure that you are knowledgeable about your coverage. Then go and google 'Top Rated Primary Care Physicians in your state' it is good to get patient reviews.  <br>  As having gone through some tough medical issues, and cancer myself I know that as individuals we are our biggest advocate.  Doctors are often too busy and have so many other concerns, our priorities are not the top of their lists, sad to say, but true.<br>  Your concerns are important and don't dismiss them because one doctor did!<br>  Chances are when you find a good doctor they will observe the growth over time to look for any changes.  And be sure to keep an eye on it yourself and if you notice any changes ie. Size, Shape, color be sure to document it and let your doctor know as soon as possible.  If it is cancer the sooner it is detected the better off you are for treatment!<br>  I wish you luck, and am sorry to hear about the unfortunate circumstances that your family is going through!  I hope, for your sake that the growth is benign.<br>  Don't worry about it, but be sure to be proactive about being seen.<br>  You can also message me if you have any other questions!<br>  Best Wishes|`|PNFS1JFqaa	I have had a lump behind my right ear fpr about 8 years. Doc said its a lymph node that never went down. Very hard for the nodes behind ears to go away as thiers no circulation in that area. I have has another doc look at it and said same thing. I found it when i was having vertigo due to bad allergies but i think it was thier b4 that peob either from tooth infection or wisdom teeth infection and just vener went away. Thiers so many different lumps u can get that just stay in your body. Craziness !|`|1da901c1e68f32ae8b022510892d658baa	behind your ear are lymph nodes (I think that's what thy're called)  My daughter got an almost gumball sized lump there 2 years ago.  She had been bitten by a tick a few weeks before that.  The docter said everything was fine, and it would go away.  It did after a while.  It had something to do with the tick, but it wasn't lyme disease.  It was harmless.  So....maybe that's it.  I'm not a doctor though, and you should get a second opinion.  You need to be careful with your body.  If it is anxiety or depression, then the second doctor will say that too.  Also - don't worry too much about meds like Zoloft or something.  You don't have to be on them forever, and they could be very helpful in your situation.

6kBAj12gaa	There are a few things you can try actually.  One thing is talk to someone about your feeling to a close friend a parent or even just a therapist. Holding it all in is not healthy and could just make your situation worse. I learned that one the heard way as well. Another good thing to do is make sure you are eating on a regular basis and eating all the food groups each day. Bananas are a great food to eat when you are down. They have a vitamin in there that reacts with your body and produces a happy endorphine so eat a few bananas every day its like a natural happy pill.<br>  <br>  Then the other thing you can do is work out get some excersice even if its walking around your block anything that can get your heart rate going will help because excersicing produces happy endorphines and makes you feel good about yourself as well..<br>  <br>  <br>  that is everything that helped/helps me when I am down|`|YX8IUaRFaa	hi, im sorry to hear that you've been so down you attempted to take your own life. i cant say i can relate to that, but when i get down and depressed sometimes i do a few things to raise me back up. <br>  1. make a really gd chillout playlist on itunes get in sum proper comfy clothes ( jack willis sweatpants) and just cotch (chill).<br>  2. Go buy some really gd ice cream and eat it, i recommend ben and jerrys baked alaska.<br>  3. do something productive that makes you feel proud or good, i go out and chop logs, because it needs doing and its satisfying to destroy things aswell. <br>  4. Masturbation, always a good past time<br>  <br>  Hope some of these help you or give you some inspiration.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I would recommend that you talk with a professional that can provide a program that will enable you to think more positively. Also, there may be other things to try of which you are unaware.<br>  <br>  Participating in activities that require your focus and provide gratification also help. Try charity work, helping at a school and other places that enable you to focus on other people's needs that are urgent. Also, when you finish there, go exercise. Maybe join a volleyball team or other activity that helps you be fit while interacting with others. <br>  <br>  A healthy balanced diet does help. I know Tom Cruise sounds crazy when he focuses on this, but there is some truth. <br>  <br>  Please try everything, especially the professional help.

Read up on foods that make moods better. You might be over using artificial substances that do not serve the body well. Diet is the number one cause of depressions and mood swings although no one will admit it. It would put most therapist out of business, not to mention the drug companies. Could you imagine, if everyone ate food that was good for them, how much healthier our world would be? There are also allergies that can cause depression, as well.

EeTs9DqUaa	Potatoes are high in carbs and type 2 diabetics need to limit carb intake .  The best way to determine how much he can eat is to test his blood before the meal and then 1 hour and 2 hours after the meal.  If he stays below 140-150 on both of the after meal readings he can eat them.  However if he goes over 150 he should either eat less or skip the potatoes.  The butter is not going to affect his blood glucose.  <br>  <br>  Sweet potatoes are better than regular potatoes on not spiking as high.|`|ympCibR4aa	He could,  it depends on how much potatoes and what else is in his meal.

FU4TyghIaa	dear pain<br>  <br>  okay, the self harm and stuff, this stuff with your pets, it really sounds typical how you describe the pain and cutting yourself to ease it, i don't want to say it, but it's typical of borderline personality disorder.  hey, i've seen some stuff in here about borderline, but it's more about how hard it is to put up with and how unjust it is for family and friends  to have borderline children and/or partners.  But seriously, these people have real trouble understanding or supporting the plight of borderlines, as most people do.  That's if you are borderline, which i won't say either way, but illness of the mental variety, yeah, well people have trouble dealing with that.  Like when they tell you to call 911 or whatever, like phone services can help?  that suggestion is not in the real world.  Some people understand how emergency services work because they've seen it in tv shows right?  <br>  What would you rather be, mentally disturbed or stupid?<br>  Think of yourself as above those suggestions.<br>  Don't get me wrong, if you're really on the verge of suicide, then you shd call them, but if you feel that way, you're very unlikely to anyway, so it's better to try and get some real intervention before it gets that bad.  The emergency numbers will want a real crisis and if you don't have one bad enough, they may have a tendency to discourage you from getting any treatment at all so as not to waste their precious time.<br>  <br>  The thing with borderlines and other mental illness, not many people understand, whatever they say, and not many doctors either.  Then understanding but actually empathising and helping you is another challenge on top of that..<br>  <br>  If you are legit with what you say, then you could use a diagnosis.  Treatment is another thing, be careful, it's hard to find the good treatment.  It's so easy for treatment to make you feel worse through guilt or misunderstanding of what the therapist is trying to tell you.  <br>  <br>  Please be supported.  Getting treatment is a real challenge.  Living with mental illness is a lifelong challenge, but take heart, people with no illness have a pretty rough trot too in this day and age.  <br>  <br>  I'd really suggest you avoid making a big scene or marching up to the gates to demand some response.  Just cause it sounds like borderline, don't go around telling people.  Clinicians have to make up their own minds.  See if you can see a school counsellor maybe as a starting place or a community or youth centre might have some workers too, who you can approach informally.  But like i say, i've known good school counsellors and absolute **** ones.  You have to try and see what you get.<br>  <br>  it would be good to find somebody who you feel supports you and you can confide in.  That can be a real challenge. I don't know where you are or what's available to you, but school counsellors, youth health centres, family health centres, many of them have counselling subsections you can go straight to and avoid sitting in a general waiting room with people sneezing in their sleeves and squirming on their piles.<br>  <br>  Like i say, my advice would be to try and get some support without having to involve too many explanations and difficult situations.  Nobody close to you (famliy) will want to know you cut.  Not because they don't care, but because they don't understand and will be very upset.  In this respect, if someone gets upset with you, or worried for you, they may become angry in an effort to get you to see sense.  Like i say, you don't want to upset people like that which can easily become just hostile, and instead you need support.  <br>  <br>  Try to talk about something, maybe call it depression until you get to see someone privately rather than blurting it all out.  Like, yes you're depressed, you have thought about harming yourself etc. and yeah you've actually cut if they want to know.  See, just tell them the story.  If they know you've self harmed, there's always a chance you'll get admitted.  That way at least you'll get a diagnosis.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with the journey, hope that makes a bit of sense.<br>  <br>  look after yourself and your pets|`|AA11215737	Well, for starters, you are purposely inflicting pain upon yourself.

ECG and 12 /15 lead telemetry. Give Beta Blockers as needed. Nitro IV infusion, pain control with morphine (or other narcotic). In many areas Paramedics are allowed to transport to a hospital with a cardiac cath lab directly based on there ECG findings, where an EMT Basic / Intermediate has to bring the patient to the closest hospital at all times.<br>  Also Medics have a much larger knowlege of anatomy and physiology then the other levels, which leads to more in-depth care.|`|PQifZodNaa	It's funny how you asked this question because I am an EMT-Basic and my dad suffered from a heart attack early early sunday morning.

e5f0c993dc43986b75d483b1ea872bc2aa	Well realizing that you do this is a big step in the right direction.  You need to feel better about who you are as a person.  It sounds like you don't have self worth and you don't value the goods things about yourself.  Try to ask yourself why I feel like crap when someone says something to me I don't like?  Why do I feel bad about me?  You are accepting messages from other to be true about you.  You need to decide who you are and screw them.  Eating your hurt away doesn't really work and you know that.  It is a cycle that never ends and only reinforces the feeling of negativity you already have.  Find the good things about you and hang on to those.  Tell yourself everyday how much you like you.  Be good to you; you are worth it.|`|FMfQVCkDaa	its all in your will power.  seriously.<br>  <br>  just tell yourself that its a stupid habit and isnt helping anything.  <br>  <br>  as an alternative, try exercising instead.  it works just as well to release the feel good hormones and gets you in shape!|`|b7dlK2Jzaa	You need to tske some pills and eat because you are going to die.

I find I get sick if I don't eat before I got exercise in the morning.  And let me just say, walking 20 minutes in the morning is something...congrats for doing it!

cGNTSoc9aa	have you just started a new form of contraception, because that can cause weight gain? Or have you quit smoking? Keep a food and drink diary for one weeks and really look at what you are eating, dont just look at calories, look at saturated fat aswell, it is the worst form of fat. Dont go crazy with it just try to reduce your saturated fat.<br>  <br>  Also i highly recommend weight watchers, i lost 5 pounds in the first week, and its my second week now. You get a chart with calories and saturated fat and learn alot too.|`|QvDOyPjBaa	speed walk, jump rope, job, aerobics, and watch your diet.  That will help burn some of the fat and tone you up.  Good luck!|`|WyNOAZb9aa	By eating right you mean you are not eating carbohydrates (sugars, starches, etc)?<br>  Limit yourself to 15 grams of carbs a day, and you will lose the fat. When you do not eat carbs, your body burns body fat to digest the high protein food you eat.  Until you add carbs to the food cycle, you will lose the fat.|`|5HFOYjCMaa	Master Cleanse will just take off water weight and leave you heavier than before when you start eating.  Diet pills don't work.  Want to lose weight?  Drink a LARGE amount of water everyday to clean out your body, it also makes your metabolism faster.  Exercise, even if it's for 15-20 minutes a day!  Eat smart - know what's going into your body and yet don't deprive yourself or you will just fail.  Make sure you are staying away from not just high saturated fats but sugar intake and sodium.  For example all calories aren't the same.  1000 calories of sugar isnt the same as 1000 calories in protien.  Eat fruit that will be better to break down the fats - grapefruit, red grapes, pineapple.  Eggs and low sodium bacon is actually a very healthy breakfast.  Almonds are a great snack to munch on.  If you drink coffee, try green tea but DONT FORGET to drink a lot of water, you'll be shocked on how much weight you'd lose just by drinking a lot of water.|`|yPltmRp2aa	Hey!

5rJ6nf2oaa	Please don't buy products, these are to make money for others and not to help you. It takes time to do a real cleanse, you can't do it by swallowing some pills. Just do it with diet, food can be cleansing as well as clogging. You just need to eliminate some things and replace with better things. I'm detoxing right now with an 8 week diet I do every year. It works. <br>  <br>  Briefly, stop red meat, animal fats, dairy, processed food and anything with additives for 8 weeks. Replace with fish/seafood (nothing fried), some lean chicken, lots of vegetables (raw is better) and fruit, whole wheat bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water to flush the toxins through. <br>  <br>  You will notice almost immediately that the toxins are leaving your body. The effects settle down after a couple of weeks then you start to feel really good.<br>  <br>  If you're interested I've attached some articles about this, they include further explanation, tips and an example diet plan.

Vitamin B (of all kinds) deficiency, Magnesium deficiency, Vitamin D (sun) deficiency and many others like Vitamin C deficiencies and Zinc can help cause depression. Make sure they eat when they are not hungry, go out with then even if they don’t want to. Push them into doing these things Aromatherapy also is good for you. (Find things that smell good and put it around you i.e. perfume). Exercise gets the endorphins going (your energy level gets higher.) Another thing, energy produces energy remember that. And finally therapy, not actually going to a therapist if you don't want to although it works too, but just talking it out with someone that will listen. And if they can't get that done take a certain time in a day that they would like to write down what they are feeling and what made them feel that way. Don’t let it get worse i am helping someone get out of depression she is cooperating and so far so good.<br>  Work out small plans day by day and make sure they do it!!!!!!<br>  antidepressants along with all of those other things would then do wonders on that person

If the area is red, swollen and tender to the touch, you might want to call your primary care doctor for advice. If the area looks like it is healing well and there is no evidence of infection, you should be fine. Just watch the area to make sure you are not getting an infection. <br>  <br>  <br>  Next time if you cut yourself use mild soap and water or peroxide to clean the cut. Apply some triple antibiotic ointment (Neosporin type med) and cover with a bandaid to keep infections away until healed or you can seek medical attention.|`|3YJe5Z4Faa	Please - no Purell or rubbing alcohol on open wounds.

Blood poisoning, staph infection, flesh eating bacteria and mirsa.

Xu1Yrayaaa	If you want to lose weight you want to avoid Increasing muscle mass at first. Cardio exercise works great for losing weight. <br>  <br>  First you need to adjust your diet to reflect your weight loss goals. Lowering your daily caloric intake is key. It's ok to eat what you want, in moderation. Food is important when starting a new exercise routine. <br>  <br>  50 lbs is a LOT of weight to lose, take your time. Your body and your skin will thank you. Start with changing your diet and with simple cardio exercises, such as walking and jogging. Keep yourself in the weight loss mentality. you need your brain, i.e. your food cravings and will to work out. Do little thinks during the day to get a little more calories burned off your backside, such as parking in a distant spot when going to the store work or the mall, walking past the snack machine and taking a smaller amount of food than you normally would. <br>  <br>  Ok now for the heart of your question. You want to target the places of your body that you want to lose weight, like your tummy or behind. Walking and jogging not only burn calories but target your abs and backside. Sit ups, leg lifts and crunches handle things in specific areas. Remember losing weight is a lifestyle change. 50 lbs won't happen over night. Losing 10 lbs a month is considered healthy. It will be slow going but it's safer than dropping 20 lbs in a month. Either way, set a reachable goal every month. 10 lbs seems small but when you look at the scale at and see you lost 15 you will feel great about yourself. likewise when you only lose 5 it won't feel like a total loss.<br>  <br>   How you eat is most important. It will work on days you can't work out. As for the exercise, just do it when you can, and think about walking or biking instead of driving, just remember, you can do it!|`|368a6e81bdaa2a5b8481b212caf63699aa	hi a lot of cardio and the right diet is the only way to go.eat 5 to 6 balanced meals and a lot of water.also a good exercise programe would help tremendously .<br>  <br>  goodluck with it all.<br>  Parwez Naqvi<br>  www.funkyfitness.net|`|DR7Nc2D4aa	Water and streching makes you loose weight fastest.

You need to be at your "target heart rate" for 30 plus minutes for the fat burning to actually happen otherwise you're just doing cardio.  Also don't get me wrong, exercise helps a lot, but if you really want to lose that much weight you are going to have to focus more on dieting.  you don't really need to change what you eat all that much, just eat less of it.  the doctor told my Mom to eat a fistful of food at mealtimes but to continue eating what she likes.  i would also eat more frequently, like 4 to 5 times a day as it increases your metabolism.  you can eat veggies as snacks because you can eat as much of that as you want without any worries of weight gain.|`|8CGOfmk3aa	You are on the right track.

AA11747527	i have a lot of dandruff on my scalp and on my face sometimes too.  I have like big flakes that stick to my scalp as well.  The only shampoo that works for me is Selson Blue.  My Dad has a similar problem and he is 83.  I went to the doctor once and he said it was something similar to dandruff (forgot what exactly) but he never mentioned anything about cancer.  Even if that was a possibility I still think it is much more likely to be a problem such as psoriasis, exzema, fungus, or even simply just dry skin.   Here is a website i found:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dandruff/DS00456/DSECTION=causes" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dandruf...</a><br>  <br>  oh and stress causes dandruff too so stop thinking about it being cancer.  if it helps just go see a doctor about it, perhaps a dermatologist.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Load of clap trap girl..They be playing with your mind..ITS dry scalp,if only recently started,whats stressing you..Stress can cause dandruff big time,so can crappy shampoo's..Suggest a visit to the Chemist & get good information about it..Be led by their knowledge..Be fixed in no time..PS my daughter,got dandruff when she was about 17,stressing about finals..She used a raw egg & flat beer,rubbed into her head &hair..Sit around for a couple of hours,then rinse it out & wash with anti dandruff shampoo,never blow dried it @ this time..Dumb old Dad had to do the brushing though..Hope this helps you..|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	And what would that be?

ZQrPoHjTaa	Establish your max. An easy way is to do 5 reps to failure and look on a bench press chart (google) to find your theoretical max press. Keep good form, once you know your max do a bench pyramid system (google). Before your max set, do something you can do for 5 reps and strive for 6, its okay if you dont hit 6 but have someone help you do a forced rep on your last one. Pyramid down the same one you went up. If you did your max easily, add on 2 or 3 pounds and try to get a new max rep high. <br>  <br>  If you are under 25, you should be able to do a 3on 1off system. Example: Chest, tris shoulders on Monday: Back Bis on Tues: Legs on Wed: rest Thurs: start chest, tris and shoulders again on Friday.<br>  <br>  Every 4th workourt on try to use dumbells for movements, this will help with strength as well as confuse your body. Just remember not to max out every workout, volume is good, but keep it around 10 sets per bodypart, overtraining is something you do not want encounter, trust me. <br>  <br>  Strive for 30 to 40 grams of protein every three hours and drink alot of water. Supplement with creating an glutamine if you want. Keep in mind there is no need to load creatine, 5grams works just as well starting out and as maintenance. Make sure you go off creatine and glutamine after 30 days, best to cycle, there is such thing as too much of a good thing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|vOOdwjMzaa	lift a weight that you can do approximately 3-5 reps with(185lbs 225lbs etc) then every week attempt to increase about 5lbs.|`|FTL1F0fGaa	well benching almost everyday helps but say your max is 100 do that until you can do at least ten reps easy then move up to 105 and just simply repeat also maybe doing pushups will help|`|emKcof02aa	do it every day|`|GWBorz3Taa	put a towel in between your shoulder blades|`|oeCIzoF9aa	Get a strong spotter.

If you feel like doing 2 hours on some days, do it separately and take one capsule before each workout. The effects of heavy resistance training go down a lot after the 1st hour.

2KC467tFaa	It's a phase. Know it will pass. You may have to take a few steps to push your life in a different direction, but this rut will transform into enjoyable experiences. Try to set aside a day just for you. It won't change overnight, but it will be a start. Read a couple chapters in an uplifting book, go for a walk, bring your camera and take pictures of pretty things, think to yourself how beautiful and peaceful some things can be, and try to enjoy what is happening in the moment. Don't worry about bills, errands, work, or anything that makes you feel like a robot. If you like animals, visit an animal shelter and spend time giving attention to the dogs and cats. Smile at people. Slowly begin doing nice things for other people. Don't go out of your way right now. I say this to save hurtful feelings if something backfires. Once you begin to open up to feelings, you might feel a bit vulnerable. If you need to cry, cry. Try to find humour in things and laugh out loud. Do something new. Go to a fun class, pick up a new hobby, volunteer, or do something out there like skydiving. The goal is to do things that make you feel good so you will enjoy life and find opportunities everywhere you look. Just don't give up on yourself. Slowly things will fall into place. Try to be patient. You could also find an inspirational quote every day and consider it. Write it down, hang it up, and start making an optimistic quote wall. I hope you begin feeling better soon.|`|EoCk1VzDaa	You should definitely try marijuana.

mlaLgoaSaa	Congrats on your new lifestyle! I did Weight Watchers for a while, and it really is a great program (as long as you are following all the guidelines). You can expect to lose 6-10 lbs your first week, but the weight loss will decrease after that (as it should). A healthy and reasonable weight loss rate would be about 2 lbs/week. So, if you change your lifestyle, you can expect to lose your 40 lbs in about 5 months. here are some other tips to jumpstart your weight loss plan:<br>  <br>  1. Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Work hard, and it will pay off!|`|AA11447210	It's not recommended to lose more than 3 lbs/wk on any plan, as that's typically a sign of unhealthy practices and greatly increases the chances of the weight coming back.<br>  <br>  If you should manage 3 lbs/wk (depends on what you eat, and your activity level) you could drop 40 lbs in approx 13 wks (towards the end of May).<br>  <br>  That's best case though...you will probably not experience the same amount of loss each week, sometimes maybe more, sometimes maybe nothing. It will vary.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|y4w6ybr3aa	It could take anywhere from 5-20 months.Don't give up. Weight Watchers works and teaches you how to eat right for the rest of your life.

Be diligent in keeping track of your points. This was ruff for my wife at first but 2 years later she still tracks everything she eats, it has become 2nd nature<br>  <br>  4. There are lots of tasty 1-2 point snacks out there for when you crave something sweet...stock up<br>  <br>  5. Use all of your daily points. Sometimes at night my wife will be searching for a 1 pt snack to finish off the day before bed.<br>  <br>  6. Start exercising, even if it is just an evening stroll to start off with. You can work your way up from there<br>  <br>  I am making a ww reference website for my wife and others. It has point info for lots of dining destinations, low point food items and a secure amazon store with lots of ww recipe books, ww scales, etc. Check it out below.|`|6PfJXI7iaa	It's all about how you follow the plan.

Eat healthy, do about 20 minutes of ab routines 3 - 4 times a week and lift fairly intense. Since your a female, cardio should be more of a priority. Eat small portions.

If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.

CfQ1WAXLaa	Are you a runner?  This appears to be the result of poor preparation and workouts before running.  I found the following information in an article on the web:<br>  <br>  Iliotibial band syndrome is an injury that has been seen over the past few years with increasing frequency. It appears to be related to weak hip abductor muscles. Strengthening the hip abductors and stretching the ITB and structures that attach in to it are usually the keys to recovering from this problem. <br>  <br>  Symptoms and Causes: <br>  <br>  Symptoms of the iliotibial band syndrome include pain or aching on the outer side of the knee. This usually happens in the middle or at the end of a run. A concomitant problem may occur at the hip called greater trochanteric bursitis. During flexion and extension of the knee the iliotibial band rubs over the femoral condyle which leads to irritation. Weak hip abductors, especially the gluteus medius is often found. Some other factors that may contribute to this syndrome include genu varum (bow legs), pronation of the foot (subtalar joint pronation), leg length discrepancy, and running on a crowned surface. We need to emphasize that over the past few years an association with weak gluteus medius muscles has been found in many runners with ITB syndrome.|`|xRvetiAMaa	The tight band can definitely cause your problem. Proper exercises & gentle stretching can correct it. Ask Mom/Dad about seeing an Athletic Trainer or Sports Physical Therapist.|`|kuIVIy57aa	You should see a Chiropracter before you do anything else. I saw one and never had pain again. Good Luck.

niZBsn9Qaa	drop your caloric intake to 1200-1500 calories a day. It's not dangerous, but any less than this would be. Make sure 60% of that be veggies, especially green ones, 30% lean proteins and 10% complex carbs (whole grains and fruits)<br>  <br>  Now, for the exercise. I insist you try HIIT training. HIIT, if you don't know already, stands for High Intensity Interval Training. You do a 2 minute warm-up on your favorite piece of exercise equipment (or if you run or jog, walk for 2 minutes) then for one solid minute, sprint, increase speed and intensity until you are huffing and puffing. Then moderate intensity for 2 minutes, then the next minute, push it again, etc etc. Do this for 20-30 minutes and it will melt fat off. It works because it makes your body constantly burn more calories because your routine changes and you don't give the body time to adjust.<br>  <br>  Plus, get yourself a tape measure. Keep track of your measurements and pay attention more to that then the scale. Bust, waist, hips, arms, thighs and calfs. You will gain muscle through exercise, which, as we all know weighs more than fat. That's why its important to not worry about the scale too much. Give yourself 2 months of this routine to start seeing results. I know it seems like a long time but losing weight takes time, its not immediate and if it is its not permanent, you'll gain it all back if you lose more than 1 to 2 pounds a week. Some people even gain back MORE than where they started.<br>  <br>  good luck and keep the faith. Perseverance is the key.|`|y3I1qSHEaa	Please do not starve yourself,  that is not a good option at all.  Eat less carbs, do at least an hour of cardio exercises every day.

The following has helped many others like you. <br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or a half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a><br>  <br>  Additionally I'd recommend reading a book to overcome self consciousness as most teenagers are self conscious.

If you aren't getting enough energy then this would cause your metabolism to slow which is why you aren't losing as much weight as you would like to. There are sites where you can enter your height, weight and age and based on your activity level it will tell you how many calories you should eat in order to lose weight. Just google search 'basal metabolic rate.'<br>  <br>  It's also recommended to eat 3 meals a day with snacks in between and to also drink plently of water. <br>  <br>  Also what kind of exercise are you doing? How long are you exercising for? How many days a week? If you use the same machines for more than a month, then your weight loss will start to plateau. You need to shock your body by using different machines in order to target different muscles. I would try to exercise 4 times a week.. try 50 minutes each time you work out, maybe 2 different machines if you can.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Honestly, unless you have some type of medical problem you cannot be doing these things correctly. How many times a day are you eating? You should spread your daily calories over 4-7 meals to keep your metabolism active. Eating every 2-4 hours (about 4-7 meals/snacks per day) is much better than having it in 1-3 meals. Are you drinking enough water? Making sure you have plenty of water will allow your body to function more efficiently which includes burning fat. How many calories per day are you consuming? If you aren't consuming enough, your body slows down it's metabolism thus causing you to lose burn calories at a slower rate. Or perhaps you are consuming too much.<br>  <br>  Do not exercise everyday. You need to give your body time to recover. Your gains come in between workouts. At least give yourself one rest day per month. Also are you doing resistance training? Building muscle helps you burn calories even while you are resting. How intense are your workouts? You should feel challenged from them. You may need to up the difficulty.

gKJkbn6laa	nicotine addiction varies from person to person. some people have a genetic predisposition to be very sensitive to nicotine, in which case they get alot more form one cig than a regular person would, thus they smoke less and do not become addicted. <br>  <br>  i read a book that included a study that was conducted on nicotine addiction which puts the 'tipping point' of cigarette addiction at most probable in those who smoke over 4 a day. after that point you are very likely to become hooked. <br>  some people on the basis of a purely addictive personality will be hooked for life from the first one. some people will smoke casually 1 or 2 a day, or a few a week and never become addicted at all. <br>  <br>  doing anything for long periods of time creates a sort of 'beaten path' that your body gets used to doing. like biting your nails some people get used to the act of smoking. this tends to happen more often in people who get sued to smoking along with certain activities [like if you have a smoke and a cup of coffee every morning for a year and then decide you want to stop smoking youre hand will reflexively miss the act of hold a cigarette.] if you decide to stop and this is a problem you can replace the cig with something of a similar shape like a pen or lollipop<br>  <br>  <br>  from personal experience:  <br>  i tried my first cig way back in like 5th grade and never touched the things again till this november. im not hooked on it, but i do like it, more so probably just because i like the act of smoking no matter what it is. i recently quit for a month cause i got caught and it was easy, and a pack lasts me at least 2 weeks. <br>  i wont push it on anyone, its got pretty bad consequences in the long run, but im not gonna say its the devil either. you gotta know yourself and your self control

vqtpF1Q5aa	I would not say you are jumping to a conclusion because those are symptoms of ADHD. I have a son now 9 with diagnosed ADHD and I knew at a young age that he was hyper and his attention span wasn't as full as it should be...Some of the things young children do is one thing but other things you can tell it's pure boredom. <br>  <br>  We can pass this through gene's to our children, yes. That is one thing that has been proven. When we had my daughter looked at for possible ADD we took her to a Psychologist who gave us a questionnaire to fill out and it helped him greatly in diagnosing her. She did hands on things with him as well as written things --- she was in the 3rd grade. She did end up with the diagnosis of ADD and we put her on Concerta and she worked through that wonderfully.<br>  <br>  When she hit puberty in about the 6th grade her ADD began to show slight reducing and we went back in and talked to the doctor and he said that sometimes in children when they reach puberty they will begin to lighten in the symptoms and that is exactly what happened with our daughter. In the 7th grade she stopped taking medication and hasn't since and she is a JR in high school now.<br>  <br>  I would say to go in and talk to your doctor about the things you are seeing in your child and see what he or she says. There are things that can be done and worked with to help ease this for you and don't ever feel bad that you possibly gave something to your child....I went through that guilt with our son more so than our daughter and although it could have passed a gene onto our children - either one of us...It's something that can be worked with....<br>  <br>  -- good luck --|`|vWLWdQGHaa	I think personally that you are jumping to conclusions you would have to wait till they get older to actually see really if they have it or not.

You will see it in your other children and in many other children too.  This does not mean they all have it.<br>  <br>  Everyone experiences ADHD to some degree, but this is a serious brain disorder  and only a small percentage of people actually have it.<br>  <br>  Imagine that ADHD is like height.  Everyone is born at a different height, some are short, some are tall and some are average, but most are normal.  Then there are people who go outside the realms of normal and are extreme and are dwarfs.  Generally short people are short but are still normal only a few are dignosed with a condition that is outside the norm.<br>  <br>  Peoples temprements are the same, some are calm, some are a bit crazy, because thats the way they are.  But just as all short people are not dwarfs, all of those who are a bit on the hyper side are not ADHD.  To be diagnosed with ADHD the problem must be very extreme and really outside the realms of what is normal.<br>  <br>  One question then is how do we determine where the line is between normal and abnormal.  And the key is in functioning.  For something to be considered a 'disorder' there must be 'disorder' ion their lives.  With ADHD there are two serious problems learning and behavior.  If they are at the top of their class then learning isnt a problem.  If they are not in constant trouble at school, being suspended and driving everyone crazy then its not ADHD.

Depend on hormonal, emotional, light exposure, exercise etc. In general the leght of the menstrual cycle is between 24 to 30 days. The norm is 28 days. So you will find that it never fall on the same date. It will came short by one to three days always,sometimes a week. The best way to get and approximate day for your first day of period is to keep  a calendar for at least a year. the fact that you have menses is the probable proof that you ovulate and are fertile. If your cycle is too irregular and fail for more than 3 months and menstrual flow is too heavy(more than 7 days, more than 6 pads per day), then you need a visit to the gynecologist.

My advice would be just to wait a few more years to see how things pan out. I know its hard, but things may sort itself out in time :)<br>  <br>  Jason|`|hHSsMyNpaa	My take on all that is antidepressants don't really make you feel happy all the time, but they narrow down quite a bit your range of emotions.  You won't feel as happy or sad for any reason.  You might not want to or even be able to cry anymore (if you ever did).  Your focus is usually a lot better.  Its a different existence.  I stopped taking them because I wanted to feel my emotions and I was going to deal with the bad stuff whatever it took.  Be aware if you are a minor you might not be able to voluntarily just stop taking these meds if you wanted to.  Don't get on that road unless you are sure you want to stick it out.<br>  <br>  >>> Agreed with Susan below - it is far better for you to go through the natural process of grief and reconciliation.  You are doing the right things right now.  It is part of an unfortunately painful growth process.  At 51 years of age I have seen my share of difficult times, so I do not want to come across as somone who is not sympathetic or compassionate towards you.<br>  <br>  I really am.

I got implants and went from a 34B (with more padding then you can imagine) to a 34DD.  I absolutely love it and would do it again in a heartbeat.  If that's what will make her happy, I don't think there is anything you can say to her to convince her not to have implants, I know I didn't listen to my husband.  Sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear.

Antibiotics are only useful against bacteria, NOT VIRUSES!  <br>  If you have a bacterial infection, e.g. chlamydia, syphillis, streptococcal meningitis, then these can all be treated by various type of antibiotic.  <br>  colds, influenza, hiv, scarlet fever are all cause by viruses and therefore not influenced in any way by antibiotics.<br>  best thing to do for a cold is keep warm and drink plenty of fluids.<br>  vitamin c is unlikely to help but a proprietary cold/flu remedy such as lem-sip can.   personally i find a hot toddy works best! - i.e. whisky, hot water, lemon juice, sugar/honey<br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Because they are caused by a virus (ie, rhinovirus).

9OyIL8P9aa	Yes, having the pains that you have are normal because without taking the 7 day break from the pill to allow your period to come is going to mess up your system. That is also why you got your cycle early is because it is not normal because you are not allowing the break that you are suppose to come. <br>  My suggestion would be to take the 7 day break. And if you are looking for a different method of birth control pill that does not allow your system to have a period, talk with your doctor or health care provider about getting you onto a different form of birth control.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|tCmwFJn5aa	You have to take the 7 day break.

4GNNOQeLaa	Your nasal symptoms are probably caused by allergies if you are not sick.  As long as you have no heart problems or uncontrolled high blood pressure you can take some OTC nasal decongestants like Sudafed or other similar products.  These will help clear you nasal passage so you can breath.  I wouldn't use nasal decongestant sprays because after 3 days they can cause nasal rebound and you will have congestion worse than before.|`|TNiX3jQ8aa	I am not an expert but do you live in a polluted area? e.g. London.

I am not sure if you have started this issue at your current place or you had it at the other places in the past as well.<br>  <br>  Better breathing exercises (pick any good book or DVD on Amazon) or running in the open space can help you apart from nose inhaler; of course, leave dairy products too. Get your allergy tested in w/ HMO clinic & stop eating the items cliniclnic finds you allergic from.
XadcGNGnaa	I have eczema and sometimes I get this. I'm not too sure whether eczema and the spots link together as I usually put it down to heat.

Don't worry, if it does start to itch put some non-fragranced moisturizer like Vaseline Essential Moisture on it and that should clear it up.

I know exactly how you feel, no matter how much you do to protect it it's still always on your mind. Pretty stressful stuff. And stress, in turn, can lead to your periods being late. Therefore causing more stress...... like a viscous circle. Just relax. Calm down. Take deeeeeep breaths. <br>  <br>  Think to youself, what am i possibly achieving by stressing out?|`|M7H6QMJQaa	You are taking the pill correctly and your timing is fine. I'm sure that you have the knowledge that having sex has risks and even using birth control does not guarantee that you will not get pregnant and you can get pregnant at any point in your cycle. Now that I said the responsible thing, I have some questions. Are you usually regular and have you been regular since you started taking the pill? It can take a while for your cycle to stabilize and during this time your periods can be inconsistent. You still have time to start your period or you may skip it and still not be pregnant. If you are really concerned take a pregnancy test and ease your mind.

EMNwWAuvaa	Vijay, you don't state what the surgery is for.  Is it for removal of a blood clot or a tumor?  Since there has been no movement for twenty days the therapist is going to be acting to prevent contractures of the left side of the body.  To do that the therapist will do range of motion movements to keep the joints and tendons limber.  They will also be trying to facilitate any return to that side by doing techniques that trigger a response in the muscles.  They will also be working with the right side to maintain strength and mobility.  Work should also be done to increase the strength of the right side of the body as there is evidence that work done on that side has a carry over effect upon the injured side.  They may also attempt to stand the person up to maintain stress on the bones to prevent osteoporosis and to maintain the body's ability to be upright when they are ready for walking.  They may also attempt to work on primative reflexes that are present in the brain.  These reflexes are suppressed as the brain matures but always remain present and in the case of a stroke or injury to the brain they may be able to be used to elicit reflexes that will help that person function.  Do not give up hope for it can take up to a year for some people to regain function.

aiBOMU9kaa	The ordinary saline won't disinfect your lenses UNLESS it is being used in a heat cleaning unit. Even then it isn't the saline that disinfects, it is the heat.<br>  <br>  Those heat cleaning units cost about 60.00 , if you can even find one anymore. They make the lenses turn yellow very quickly.<br>  <br>  Your only option is to use multi purpose solution, and you can use saline just for rinsing. Saline is NOT good for storage of your lenses either, although it can be used in an emergency to store them overnight if you run out of multi-purpose solution. But then the next day, you would have to get multi-purpose and disinfect them before wearing them again.<br>  <br>  Saline is just salty water ( sterile )...it has no cleaning or disinfecting properties to it.|`|2WK2UoPyaa	Go with the multi-purpose.

It only disinfects and stores correctly with a heat disinfection unit. If you use the saline and do not heat disinfect, you are not disinfection your lenses at all. Plus, the multi purpose solution also has a surfactant in it that cleans the lens and also a mild enzyme that removes protein deposits, and your saline has none of those. Use the cleaning and disinfecting system that your doctor recommended for you and your contacts, that is your best bet.
ZQMjPCDxaa	You should stop cutting. I've been there, I know what you're going through, and I know what feels better than continuing to cut-- reaching a year without touching a razor or tool. The more you cut, the worse you're going to be. Its sounds to me that you have become so attached to what you are doing to yourself that you know no other way of dealing with your problems. Break ups are really really tough, especially when you've been going out for such a long time. But you WILL get through this, but you might not survive long enough if you continue this self-harm.<br>  <br>  A website I've always found helpful is facetheissue.com.

Trust me. I've felt better than I ever did while I was self-inflicting, because I know that I can overcome my issues without hurting myself anymore. One way I deal with my problems is by running. I run until I hurt, and at the same time it releases endorphins that help raise my mood. So it helps out in many ways. I highly suggest trying it out.

hfigZbx5aa	It's not an anti-stress. The ingredient in Benadryl is Diphenhydramine, which is an antihistamine known for causing drowsiness. Part of becoming drowsy is having the muscles relax out.

If your not taking in the right calories you will hit the WALL. You  have to learn how the calories of your food work with the your metabolism. Even if your not real over weight I have found the information from The Biggest Loser site really helpful. I right my goals every day on my bathroom mirror with a dry erase marker. It reminds me of the work I have to do and positive things that will come from it. Be positive and relax! Eat your meals, remember if your body feels starved it will go  in to survive mode and use your muscle for fuel. Small meals more often, fresh fruits & vegetables, lean meats, water,water water!

1Ad7jJgwaa	Yeah exercise is a good vice. Go jogging for a mile or two 2 times a week. Keep yourself eatting healthy, because the name of the game is energy. The more energy your body has, the more active you'll feel. Depression is about immobility, feeling like you can't escape or pursue anything out of your reach successfully. Anything you do mentally or physically that works against that idea will benefit you.<br>  <br>  Keep an online journal too. It makes a good reference and can act as motivation. Be optimistic and progressive when you write.

Only do this for about 2 weeks though because it is NOT healthy...

And, furthermore, the doctor is not considering that sleep apnea is a common and treatable condition and you need to be tested to know if you have it!!!  A sleep disorder test is done by a doctor who specializes in the tests and they do a sleep study to monitor your sleeping patterns and how many times you wake up, etc.  It's a very common problem and a pretty serious condition that can cause further issues down the road.  Get another doctor!|`|ZQV4QAD3aa	do you have a normal ritual before you go to bed. i clean a little and then read for 30 min.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	my dad has sleep apnea .. most common signs are if you stop breathing at night for long periods of time (i used to have to wake my dad up cuz i thought he had quit breathing acouple times) when you drive for long periods of time you fall asleep at the wheel ( once again my dad did this many times... he was almost hit by a semi because of it)  what my dad did was went in the hospital and they did a sleep study test on him ... where you stay there over night and they have machines hooked up to you monitoring your oxygen level (the nurse had to wake him at least 5 times that night because he had stopped breathing for several minutes at a time) if you do have sleep apnea it is very noticable .. you may also want to look into to see if you are annemic ... i was annemic when i was younger i constanlty slept and didnt have any energy (caused by low iron because i wasnt eating enough meat) <br>  <br>  i hope this helps you|`|gUCjkj9oaa	if you can sleep 12-14 hours straight then you don't have sleep apnea|`|VCIZJQCJaa	it doesn't sound like sleep apnea however there is a condition people get where they wake up within 15 minutes or so same time each night,it is called insomnia depressive order.caused from stress usually,but can be from the toxins in the food we eat and the environment.

Keep a little diary, which I know is hard because you are never sure when it is going to happen.  Did you try anything for the pain?  Take some ibuprofen or Tylenol if you are not allergic.

WzKrZoHQaa	It will be hormonal at yr age - but you can help as diet plays a big part in the healthy appearance of our skin.  As I tell my 16 yr old - if you have good skin you can then wear the cheapest of make up and you will still look good - BUT if you have bad skin then even the most expensive stuff on the shelves will not make you look any different.<br>  <br>  Do eat more fruit and veg and cut out crisps, nik naks, quavers, skips all that sort of thing that tends to be easily available in the cupboard - these are FULL of fat and you can even set fire to many as they have so much fat - no joke but don't try this at home!  Cut out fast foods and pizza - deffo cut out cheese for say a month and see how you skin is then - I bet you see a huge difference.  You may not realise the amount of animal fat there is in cheese.  Don't get me wrong I'm not a strict Vegan or anything like that banging the drum for vegetarianism far from it - I'm a fully paid up member of the carnivore society and love steaks, cheeses  etc but I have found I have to keep them as a now & again "treat" otherwise my skin just tries everything it can to get rid of the fat and oil I have just eaten and it shows in my face  Good luck Hun.|`|5h0nUQODaa	your doctor can give you some really strong stuff for them that should help it clear up<br>  <br>  my friend has had them since your age.. shes 16 now and has had to have microdermabrasion.. haha.|`|74zKhLxQaa	your a teenager and its natural.. somethin u gotta deal with unless u want surgery or really strong medication..|`|MnTvROkmaa	make-up

3YJe5Z4Faa	The standard amount of blood that they want to take from a donor turns out to be a rather large fraction of the blood that a small person has.  The reason they don't want you to donate is that they're afraid of taking too much of your blood and inducing anemia - that would cause fatigue, rapid heartbeat, exercise intolerance, shortness of breath, and increased likelihood of passing out.<br>  <br>  This would continue until your body made enough blood to replace what they took.<br>  <br>  God bless you for trying to donate anyway!|`|niwq7mvKaa	anemia, shock. best case they don't want you passing out from blood loss|`|6RmWCmUNaa	Your body may not be capable of making the blood back to go around your body quick enough. i think people who are thinner dont make as much blood to keep their body warm as other people. <br>  im not sure<br>  but that is just my opinion.

If that's the case, you should be in the clear.  It usually depends on how much you've smoked, when the last time you smoked was and the half life of the THC of the kind of weed you smoked.  <br>  <br>  The tail end of the range of THC being detectable is generally agreed upon to be around 30 days - so it looks like you're in the clear.

PZtvRcPBaa	You partially answered your own question.  A big part of the reason that you are confused and depressed is that you are 15.  Your body goes through a lot of hormonal changes at this age.  There is a lot of insecurity that goes with changes in your body.  You may feel like it's not even your body anymore and that me be why you feel you are ugly. <br>  Your entire life will not always be like this. It sounds like you do quite well in school, so you have a lot going for you.  Try to be more social.  get involved in subjects that your are interested in.  You will most definitely find that there are other people who are having exactly the same feelings you are having.  Once you surround yourself with like-minded people, you will realize that you are not alone.<br>  Whatever you do, DO NOT DROP OUT OF SCHOOL!  School is the best chance you have at making sure your life later on is better than it is now. Try to hang in there and know that it will not always be this bad.  Life is all about change and how you get through it.  Once you get over this hurdle you will all the happier because you will know that you did it.|`|aJ9S77fDaa	how will your entire life be that way?<br>  you leave school at some point right?<br>  <br>  just do what you have to do and keep working hard.<br>  i know its boring and you dont think theres a point to it,<br>  but so did i,and now in my last few months im working my *** off so that i can get good qualifications for when i leave.<br>  (i have very little idea of what i want to do)<br>  <br>  if you do the same,you will open more doors for yourself to enjoy life.<br>  you can go down any route you want and do so much.<br>  <br>  & unless theyre really pathetic,people go for personality over looks,so if youre convinced youre ugly,which your probably not,then dont worry.|`|RwStCt82aa	At least you are only fifteen.

Im in my 3rd year in college and I still dont know what I want to do with my life. Be more easy going. Dont stress over the small stuff. The journey there is worth even more than the end result.

There are a considerable number of patients who have a short P-R interval, normal QRS complex and bouts of tachycardia. They are usually females, in middle life, devoid of organic heart disease and exhibit a snapping apical first heart sound. They do not demonstrate any of the features of anomalous A-V conduction.

hQGxAYZdaa	i would say just try doing exercises in the comfort of your own home. jumprope, pushups, curl ups, ect. and as for dieting just watch what you eat. common sense tells you what good for and whats not good for you, so just try watching what you eat also.|`|I54KyS8Laa	Hi, <br>  Last I checked, processed junk foods cost more than fresh fruits and veggies. <br>  As far as exercise goes, it's great, but not necessary. If you want to jog, drive to a safe area of town or a safe high school and use their track. Inside your home you can run in place, skip rope, jumping jacks, put a ball about the size of a soccer ball behind your back and do sit-ups. <br>  Following tips have helped a lot of others your age: <br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or a half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a><br>  <br>  Additionally I'd recommend reading a book to overcome self consciousness as most teenagers are self conscious.

4GNNOQeLaa	You should avoid any food product that has Vitamin K in it.  Green leafy veggies are a good source of vitamin K.  If you take a multi-vitamin make sure it does not have Vit K in it as well.  But if your diet is consistent and you know what to eat and not to eat then your doctor should increase your Coumadin/Warfarin dose to get your INR to the level they want you to be at.  Checking your INR regularly is important to, so if you have insurance or go to a coumadin clinic try to find a good routine so you can get a good grasp on your INR level.  Also other drugs may decrease the effectiveness of the coumadin so you should talk to your pharmacist if you are taking other medications.|`|DDswEgtZaa	try to avoid:<br>  <br>  Kale <br>  Spinach <br>  Brussel sprouts<br>  Turnip greens <br>  Collards <br>  Cabbage<br>  Swiss chard <br>  Parsley <br>  Mustard greens <br>  Avoid eating cranberries, drinking cranberry juice, or taking cranberry herbal products <br>  Avoid drinking alcohol, which can increase some of the side effects of this medication <br>  Avoid smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco.

The most popular natural passion products are Tribulus, Maca, Horny Goat Weed, Yohimbe, Avena Sativa, Tongkat Ali (or LongJax), L-Arginine, and L-Citrulline. Each of those help a different aspect of sexual health, so you might need to try a few.<br>  One thing to note is that Yohimbe does have a warning that it may increase your blood pressure, so you have to watch out for that.

With that in mind, a short cleaning with an alcohol swab will do little to your skin, but a longer contact will dry it out, literally by sucking the water out. <br>  <br>  This is not for just medicinal alcohol, and I hope you are talking about rubbing alcohol, it does the same thing with any alcohol.  <br>  <br>  If you drink too much liquor, it will draw the water out of your system in much the same way, possibly causing a lot of harm.

AA11528369	To quit smoking, you can do the following things: <br>  <br>  Write down the reasons why you smoke. <br>  <br>  Know in which situations you like to smoke best. <br>  <br>  You should know these situations very well (for example, when you are having a good time) and start to think of a solution for how you want to deal with that situation. More. <br>  <br>  Determine the day you will stop. That can be tomorrow, but you can also wait for a more favourable moment. <br>  Tell the people around you that you are going to quit. Possibly with somebody else. <br>  Take away everything that reminds you of smoking. <br>  Stop radically; it gives you the best chance of success. <br>  Change your eating and drinking habits. Drink a lot of water, eat a lot of fresh fruit and be aware of 'pleasure drinks' like coffee, tea and alcohol. <br>  Take care of enough physical relaxation. Go for a walk or a ride or go swimming. <br>  Reward yourself. Do nice things or give yourself something, like a cd or clothes. <br>  If you fall back, don't give up. Find out in what situation it happened and try to find out with what (alternative) behaviour you can react in the future. If you manage to come through the same situation next time, you have become stronger. <br>  The desire to smoke is one of the first things you notice when you stop smoking. Such a moment lasts a few minutes. It comes, stays for a while and then goes. If you have stopped smoking recently, you will have that desire more often than after a few weeks. After a while, the periods between 'wanting to smoke' get longer and longer. Ultimately, the desire to smoke diminishes. Nicotine patches, self-help books and your doctor can help you to stop smoking. Also, health care centres usually have special "quit smoking" programs. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck! fight the hard fight I will be pulling for you

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.<br>  Side Lunge Slide<br>  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.<br>  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot to the side, torso<br>  upright and abs in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position,<br>  repeating 8-12 times. Switch legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.<br>  <br>  Lunge Slide<br>  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.<br>  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot back into a lunge<br>  position, keeping the right knee behind the toe, torso upright and abs<br>  in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position and repeat 8-12<br>  times. Switch legs and repeat on each leg for 2-3 sets.<br>  <br>  Front One-Legged Squat<br>  Stand on a step or small platform. Lift left leg out in front of step<br>  and bend the right leg, bringing the toe of the left foot to the<br>  floor. Touch the floor lightly and keep the knee of the bent leg in<br>  line with toes. Straighten the right leg and repeat 8-12 times. Switch<br>  legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.<br>  <br>  Chair Squat<br>  Stand in front of a chair with feet hip-width apart, abs in and torso<br>  straight. Slowly bend your knees and lower and until you're almost<br>  touching your butt to the chair. Hold for 2-3 seconds, knees behind<br>  the toes, and straighten. Repeat for 12-16 reps, 2-3 sets.<br>  <br>  Heel Drops with Leg Extension<br>  Stand on step or platform with left leg on the step, right leg<br>  hanging off the side. Bend the left leg and lower the right foot<br>  towards the floor (a few inches). Straighten the left leg and bring<br>  the right leg out to the side, foot flexed, in a leg extension.

Squeeze the glutes and hamstrings and straighten<br>  the legs until they are level with the hips. Hold for 2-3 seconds, and<br>  lower letting toes lightly touch the floor. Repeat for 2-3 sets of<br>  8-12 repetitions.|`|SpcYCBndaa	eat less<br>  do more|`|a6hQftotaa	well heres a tip<br>  WORK OUT<br>  hugs not drugs<br>  ?|`|onVUS2fGaa	Congratulations on losing that 20 lbs. Unfortunately, it sounds like your body is just predisposed to storing fat around your thighs and waist (pear-shaped). It'll be the first place your body stores fat, and the last place it comes off. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. You're on the right track, just keep up your healthy new diet and exercising daily. Make sure you maintain a variety in your workout routines to keep yourself from getting bored and from reaching a plateau.<br>  <br>  Good luck, keep up the good work.|`|Rwf8D5toaa	Shannon D's answer is excellent, so I have nothing to add in that area!<br>  <br>  I do want to give you perspective:<br>  First, keep your expectations reasonable. You are only thirteen! Don't expect to look like photos you see of fit adults. Your body just isn't there yet.<br>  <br>  Second, you may be eating healthy foods, but are you eating the right amounts? Go to a couple of reliable websites (or talk to your doctor or dietician), and see what they recommend for your activity level (which is rather high). You may be eating too little or too much.<br>  <br>  Third, it can take time. If you're trying to lose lots of weight, it's normal to hit a plateau. Just keep going, and don't get discouraged. You've already accomplished so much!|`|wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to
rTJeVb6Aaa	Concentrate on aerobic exercises, like go to Self.com and they have some pretty good ones. I have a problem right now where I have been doing weight machines to strengthen them, but it makes them bigger! I started trying aerobic exercises and saw a difference in the way they become toned. So by doing aerobic workouts, you strengthen them while keeping them lean. Good luck!|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Butt and thighs are probably the easiest to exercise (if you ask me, anyway!)<br>  <br>  You should get a bike and start using it, instead of a car.  You'll really see some results that way!<br>  <br>  Other things are... running, rollerblading, jumping jacks,..... anything that requires you to use your legs, really.|`|EceJ73w8aa	i'm a swimmer and my old coach used to have me do a TON of leg lifts. that may sound like just lifting one leg to the side and then the other but that's not what it is. if you've ever swam freestyle you know you have to kick your feet nonstop without moving your knees or bending your toes. just do that in the air a BUNCH (starting with 3, 30 second kicks and then going up eventually to 2, 30 second and 3, 45 second kicks and so on. basically all you do is kick in the air as though you were in the water but your feet have to be in a straight diagonal line and you have to kick fast while laying on your hands, this not only works on your thighs but also is even better for your stomach than crunches and sit ups|`|bAY9j21Paa	ballet type moves....did you actually just trya nd google "exercises for butt and thighs" you will get a crap load of results and they all work as long as they are done with additional diet and cardio|`|j2gDHCSyaa	Cardio - Running , Jumping jacks<br>  Do lunges they help you loose them thigh fats!

It sounds like an anxiety attack, but I am no doctor and I wouldn't know for sure. If you haven't already, google your symptoms (exactly as it happened) and sometimes you will find that someone else has had the same exact problems and may have found an answer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I hope you find your answer!

ji5vcwcvaa	That seems okay but you should eat more fruits and vegetables. Don't eat processed food (egg beaters, butter, mayo, whipped cream)|`|pjFe5FWTaa	No, it doesn't sound like too much. However, you might want to cut down on the block cheese and replace the 'i can't believe it's not butter' with olive oil.<br>  Making those small changes would be even healthier and can make all the difference when it comes to reducing your overall calorie intake.|`|RPpXarDDaa	sounds good to me..5 smaller meals are better than three big ones. i would continue and switch high fat foods for low fat ones. don't cute breakfast...and if you wanted you could cute lunch and have early dinners. and then a fruit before bed|`|1tjJPHpMaa	sounds pretty good
KBOcgbOVaa	Take Ibuprofen, as it's a inflammatory medication. If your toothache gets worse, you need to see a dentist! He could probably give you something stronger or it might be infected, abscessed, or rotting. Don't risk your health!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Take ibuprofen instead. Aspirin can ruin your stomach lining, if you're not careful. If you have a toothache, you need to see a dentist.|`|NBuFZd5Aaa	IBUPROFEN are best for tooth ache. Take 3 tablets 4 x a day for sever pain...or 4 tablets 3x a day...If it's not that painful then take 1 or 2....Hope this help. IF you are planing to take out your teeth asprin would not be a good med to take at this time. It will cause you to bleed easier when you have an extraction.
HBx6q05Oaa	The best thing for tooth pain is Ibuprofen (motrin). If you're over 16 and normal weight, you can take 800mg three times a day with food. This will work better and last longer than aspirin, plus you dont risk the chance of increasing your bleeding times.|`|AA12082265	I agree with Randy CCRN........Good advice........One thing to add to Randy's comments --- Take ibuprofen with food for it is hard on the stomache and can cause stomache upset......
f13c61e5eac8be2f275c050b8cdb9a2aaa	Ahh Hey Mr. P90x. Im a month into mine. I take my protien supplement twice a day along with a protien bar. It differs with everyone. I take <a href="http://www.bodyconcept.com/family/5777/display.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyconcept.com/family/5777/d...</a> protien muscle meal shakes. They are about 50 dollars and that will last you about a month at a time. Its expensive but it also has alot of other great stuff for you such as more creatine for you to get that extra couple reps in each workout. I also take protien bars but I choose those by random and by what I start to like more... Of course I make sure they collaberate with my diet though. Hope this helps!|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	don't ever touch any weight gainers...<br>  <br>  but take whey protein that is on the lighter side<br>  and take glutamine for your recovery as well<br>  don't eat excessive carbs either<br>  <br>  and u should still weigh train...

It is only at 12 and that puts you in the 1 (out of 100) percentile. (check your BMI at: www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/ - cut and paste this link to get to the site).  This puts you in the category of needing to see a doctor right away.  If it were a little under the minimum BMI of 19 that would be one thing but at 70lbs you are already very dangerously underweight!  Even as a gymnast that is way too low.  Have you talked to a doctor?  You may have some psychological issues here.  You could be suffering from anorexia or something similar (visit this site: <a href="http://www.mamashealth.com/anorexia.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mamashealth.com/anorexia.asp</a> ).  At 5'3" the low end of healthy weight is 105lbs (go to: <a href="http://teens.lovetoknow.com/Average_Height_and_Weight_for_Teenager" rel="nofollow">http://teens.lovetoknow.com/Average_Heig...</a> ).  You should NOT be dieting.  If your coach recommended you lose weight he is not a good coach.  That advice is unethical!  You need to gain weight.  You could die if you try to lose more!  Please do not become another victim of body image mis-perception.<br>  <br>  I hope you seek some real help with this issue.|`|kiKB7tdaaa	You're severly underweight... I hope you aren't serious.

Listen to your doctor. Why can't you put the suppositories in? It's NOT HARD. If you are not too large to wipe yourself without an extendy tool then you are perfectly capable of giving yourself a suppository. Not being mean, some people really are that big and you gave no reason for why you "can't do it". If that's not it- yes, it might be a little gross but your hands wash. If you fear your butt is so dirty you can't bear the thought of touching it, then either grow up and gtf over it or BATHE!!! Next of all, quit straining. That will make it worse and then they'll bleed. Sorry if this sounds a little mean, but this is the God's honest truth.<br>  <br>  Listen to your doctor. If you can't use a suppository, CALL THE DOCTOR BACK! it's not hard. Now, what do you find worse- obeying your doctor and having to wash your finger, or having to be given a relaxant and dealing with the pain of having a twenty foot hose with a camera on the end put into your intestines and THEN being told to obey the doc and have to use a suppository?

Alcohol will lower glucose levels. Adjust to the way your body reacts to the carbs and alcohol. <br>  <br>  For a woman I would cut that to 4 beers a day if I was you.|`|pVCIrAs1aa	I have a friend that is a type 2 diabetic and they tell him that it is ok to have at least1 because even though the sugar content is small 4 beers can raise your blood sugar 20%|`|pRF5LLloaa	less than one (1).<br>  <br>  Consumption of alcohol should be limtied to no more than three beers (or two hard liquor drinks) a WEEK.

Important to note, however, that moderately elevated levels of blood sugar will not cause symptoms but WILL still do long-term damage to the body so the absence of symptoms is not a reliable sign of satisfactory blood sugar control.

It is the last source of energy your body wants to use.  Your body excretes any protein it doesn't use which is anything above 1g per pound of body mass for an athlete.  Also trying to consume too much protein also means consumption of too many calories.  Cut down on red meats and fried foods.<br>  <br>  That being said, the intensity and type of workout determines if you fat burn, tone or build.  You can build muscle by using heavier weights.  Lighter weights for maintenance and tone. <br>  <br>  For fat burning you want to use a low intensity workout where your heart rate is around 70% of your maximum heart rate--usually for 1 hour or more.(Walking or slow jog). <br>  <br>  Cardio increases heart and lung capacity as well as muscle growth as it is usually a higher intensity and the primary energy source is sugar/glycogen and some fat.|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	Have you lifted weights before? if not start out with like 100-150 grams of protein weak muscles don't require as much protein as strong do.<br>  <br>  Cardio will slim you down.<br>  <br>  sorry i didn't full read your question. you could start with 150 tho i don;t see a problem there i weight 170 pounds and i get about 120 grams of protein.<br>  <br>  Btw whey protein <3<br>  <br>  270 is a bit too much try 200 =]<br>  <br>  I will continue to update my answer as I see fit.

They are very easy to wear and when you have them in you cant even tell. You have to have a good teacher to show you how to put them in and take them out, and it does take practice. I have found that its easier for girls than boys! They don not hurt! Go fo it!

As soon as people get sloppy and casual, the risk goes up.<br>  <br>  I've fitted contacts to 12 year-olds and younger, especially when there was a real need because of active sport. <br>  Modern soft lenses are not generally hard to wear at all.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	If you are responsible enough then get them- people younger than you have been known to use them!

QqY8YgGDaa	Learn relaxation techniques<br>  --You can read information written by yahoo answerers and you know how to write e mail messages to any answerer  here ,by clicking here in profile picture|`|mTwn8p79aa	Remember that good deep relaxation is almost as good as actually sleeping.  The most important part here is not to stress about not being able to sleep.<br>  <br>  To help get into a deep state of relaxation you should try a little visualization.  Get in a comfortable position in your bed and talk yourself though relaxing in your inner dialog.  "Breathe deeply and relax.  My feet are very calm and relaxed.  With each breath they become more relaxed and start to feel heavy.  This sensation moves slowly into my calves and with each breath they become more relaxed.  Now my hands are completely relaxed, with no stress or muscles being used . . . "<br>  <br>  I know it sounds a little "touchy, feely" but it will really help you relax, especially to "turn off" that over active mind at night.<br>  <br>  As for sweating, I think you need to invest in a lighter blanket or turn the thermostat down.  If you just sweat from one spot, like your underarms, you might want to look into hyper-hydrosis.  There are several products that help this problem.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Well it could be a number of things .....just out of curiosity are you overweight? or are you stressing over something at school or even you social life? try to start taking a nice relaxing warm bath before you turn in for the night and then when you go to lay down just cover up with a sheet and see if it helps you can also put a cold rag on the back of your neck when laying down and it will help cool you down|`|aNbYThzsaa	Same here! I was taking trazadone for sleep, It helped but it made me eat everything in site. So I am instead going to ask for rozerum, it is not a narcotic like other sleep medications. It has no addictive traits also.|`|QYq1sdbdaa	your body could be detoxing - if you have been smoking and boozing. Not that 16 yr olds would do that in the UK!|`|p96PiyiIaa	Finding it hard to fall asleep at night is called onset insomnia, and not being able to maintain consistent sleep is called middle insomnia. If your too stressed then that can cause insomnia, because you cant switch your brain off or relax. Anxiety, fear and stress might also be the reason you sweat so much. If you bedroom is too hot, that makes it harder for you too sleep well; open the window or turn fan on or something so your room is well ventilated. <br>  Sleep problems and irregular sleeping patterns are common in teenagers though. Apparently, teenagers are better rested when they go to bed late at night and wake in the late Morning. It's just how the body clock functions I guess. <br>  I have insomnia too, so I just read or watch a DVD or play on my laptop until I feel sleepy (last night I watched Batman Begins and The Dark Night). Because these things stimulate the brain it can help falling asleep. Relaxation techniques like listening to music or drinking herbal tea or taking a warm bath can help relive any stress you might be feeling and calm you down. Just laying still and breating slowly is 80% as good as falling asleep. If none of these work try seeing your GP. <br>  Take care xx|`|avF364R8aa	Hmmm depends, there are a lot of reasons why this can be happening, but let's tackle the obvious question. Are you stressed?
AA11447210	Washing a lot removes the skins natural oils. If you are concered, get a good quality moisturizer and use it after you shower.

Sounds like you aren't showering any more than the average person - you should be ok.
ouzrDPaSaa	Heya, Are you not still doing your nursing course?  If you are then I wouldnt worry, you should be able to get a newly qualified nurse position.  Remember, lots of people join nursing courses straight from college/school and have little work background.  As long as you can get good references from your personal tutor and a placement mentor or something it should be okay.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Oh no, Im really sorry to hear about that!  You shouldnt have to leave though.  As a student you are not held accountable for your actions, and you cant be forced to leave because you've made a complaint.  You're perfectly entitled to do that.  While I was on my nursing course someone in my cohort gave x amount of one drug when it was meant to be x amount of a different drug. He could have really hurt the patient involved, but luckily the patient and his family saw the funny side.  Nothing happened to the student though, the nurse he was with should have been monitering him!  Hope it all works out for you x|`|VHmNfHa6aa	Yes I was for a few months.

I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.

However, lymph nodes that remain swollen for 4-6 weeks should be brought to the doctor for a check as ONE reason (out of MANY) for a lymph node to be swollen for 4-6 weeks is cancer.|`|7fb808f1aa4b2c411633165e9aafc57faa	Get it checked by a doctor.  It could be an infection.  Rather than focus on what it may or may not be, go see a doctor who will exam it first and decide whether a blood test, x-ray and perhaps a biopsy or scan is needed. Get peace of mind and see a doctor.  THEY have the real answer, not us.|`|DDswEgtZaa	swollen lymph nodes usually occur in result of an infection of some type.  If it is persistant and lasting more than 4 weeks then I would definetly call your DR and schedule an appt.

They cause massive weight gain.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	You have a good chance of killing your mom by having her stop her regular meds and go on the natural remedies, which do not work. Omega 3 was promising, but follow up studies have found it to be ineffective for bipolar. So it's still up in the air - if it was extremely effective, you wouldn't have had these studies showing no benefit. So any benefit is modest, at best.  Lithium carbonate is a standby for bipolar, and it is a naturally occuring mineral.  Exercise and getting lots of bright light are also natural, and do help. But they are not enough. She may end up killing herself if she does not have adequate medical treatment.  There is no cure for bipolar disorder. Some people only have a few episodes in their lives, and maybe can get by without ongoing treatment, but for your mom, it appears to be chronic (as it is for me) and she will have to take the horrible meds. You have made a huge mistake with this "help" you are providing - she needs to see a psychiatrist and get more help.  Bipolar is a VERY severe mental disorder. 20% of people kill themselves, it hurts so much.  Quit acting like you know what to do - if you did, you would know it is an incurable disorder!  Some people do not get better with medications, but that is not common and the science of medicine needs to improve. Also, bipolar research is very, very poorly funded compared to other problems, which doesn't help.|`|VHmNfHa6aa	I know how you feel but bipolar is treatable but no permanent cure. She needs to stay on meds and if they are not working then take her to her doctor and explain the meds aren't working so they can try other meds or treatments.

N9nJWYa5aa	If you are lucky you can pick them up for a little under ￡70.  It's fun, and can help you with your stability and general fitness.  It's not going to make you sweat much though (I have one and love it).
M0qoqvJbaa	The reason your skin is loose is because it's been stretched and there's no more fat left there (at least not enough).<br>  <br>  In order to shape up, you either have to build muscle or get excess skin removed surgically.  Some times there's just no other way.<br>  <br>  The healthiest choice is always to combine cardiovascular exercises with weightlifting to meet your fitness goals.  If you aren't willing to dedicate the time to it, I don't know what results you hope to achieve.<br>  <br>  For your cardio exercises you don't want a slight "burn" you want to get your heart rate up, and keep it up.  That's how you strengthen the heart and lungs.  For muscle building, you have to put the muscles under stress and make sure you're getting the proper nutrients and recovery periods to stimulate hypertrophy.<br>  <br>  I don't know what your fitness level is at and I don't know what your goals are, but in both activities you want to utilize as many muscle groups as possible as well as give maximum and consistent effort through your work out routines.  They work best when they're alternated so that you don't get burnt out and to help promote muscle growth.  Muscle itself is much denser than fat so it takes up much less space, but it also burns lots of calories to build and also burns lots of calories to maintain, your body will want to burn to maintain muscle so long as you have a healthy diet and remain active.  If you have a poor diet and remain inactive, your body will switch priorities.<br>  <br>  If you're young, your skin should have some natural elasticity left and should work to conform with your body's changes even if it didn't keep up with the weight loss so far.  If you're getting on in years, I really do think surgery is the answer for a problem that then becomes more cosmetic than health related.|`|hMLqqI8raa	Isometrics.

It isn't as bad as it sounds and it is not that noticeable. <br>  <br>  I do understand your concerns but the alternative is that you your heart could suddenly stop- the ICD will give you a better quality of life. The electric circuit will check your heartbeat. If your heart starts to beat too quickly, the ICD sends an electric signal which will shock your heart back into a normal rhythm.<br>  <br>  The operation to put it in only takes about an hour, you will only be in hospital over night and you should be allowed to go home the next day or the day after- providing there are no complications.<br>  <br>  The cut is only about 8 centimetres long. A cut will be made across the chest just below the collar bone. Dissolvable stitches are generally put in afterwards.

Your health has to come first.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  No, people with LQTS who are having syncopes despite beta blockers, generally find that ICD is the next step for effective arrhythmia termination. <br>  <br>  Have you already had one cardiac arrest? How often were you getting the dizziness? Beta blockers can do that too. If you are concernd then have a chat with your GP and tell him your concerns. increasing your beta blocker dosage will likely not help.

The transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor. The pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow reconstitute all three blood cell lines, giving the patient a new immune system, red blood cells, and platelets. However, besides the risk of graft failure, there is also a risk that the newly created white blood cells may attack the rest of the body.

989f721f6f0094f42c5e2c07d44ee693aa	I read something a while ago about about an imbalance of amino acids...lysine and arginine...<br>  when you eat foods high in arginine the imbalance might make you more susceptible to an outbreak. Since lysine is an amino acid that your body cannot produce, I've been taking about 1000 mg of lysine supplements a day(double that if you feel like you're getting an outbreak). Taking lysine along with handling stress better has brought my annual outbreak count from 5-8 down to 2-4.  I also just got a prescription for Acyclovir from my doctor to lessen the duration of outbreaks when I get them. Oh, also I've been using herpecinL instead of regular old chapstick because it contains lysine.  I've been dealing with these things for a long time...they suck and always show up at the worst moments.|`|LlUXPZm0aa	Coldsores are a herpes virus (Dont't worry not the genital kind it has nothing to do with sexuall contact).  It also has nothing to do with the foods you eat.  However avoid citrusy foods and drinks such as oarnge juice because they are more acidic and will prevent healing.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Food does not cause cold sores, the herpes virus does.  Nothing you do or don't eat will cause them or cure them.  If they're particularly troublesome, see your doctor.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Reduce consumption of processed foods, cola drinks, sugar and caffeine, which may increase the chance of an outbreak. <br>  <br>  Drink alcohol in moderation.<br>  Make sure to have a healthy diet with plenty of fresh, unprocessed foods.<br>  Eat foods high in vitamin C or take a supplement of at least 1,000mg daily.

I could feel them half way up my cheeks, it was nasty, but when I started wearing a baseball cap swimming I didn't get one again, ever. I think it was too much sun and the salt in the water. I always wear lipsalve in the cold now and I have not had a cold sore for 15 years.

It's probably nothing but best to get checked.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	From all the things that I have read and heard about cancer, it does not hurt until you get in the final/fatal stages of it, so I would rule cancer out.

6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	Wow ... lucky you! When I had GD my diet was the same as yours, except mine had 15 grams instead of the 30's, and 30 grams where your 45's are. They're really letting you eat.<br>  <br>  One of the more important parts of this diet is to keep a steady stream of carbs. You should not under any circumstances skip your meals or snacks. If you must, then eat fewer carbs at each sitting.<br>  <br>  It's only hard to get started. Once you figure out what you're doing it gets easier. You want to think of foods in 15 carb increments, that's called a carb serving. It doesn't have to be 15 exactly ... I've been told anywhere from 18 to 12 carbs can be considered a serving. 1 carb serving includes: <br>  <br>  18 red grapes<br>  1 cup cantaloupe cubed<br>  1 small apple<br>  1 1/4 cup whole strawberries<br>  2 clementines<br>  1 banana<br>  <br>  Some people say a banana is two, but I buy smaller sized ones, and you can be a little more flexible with fruit anyway.<br>  <br>  Lots of packaged foods will give you servings in 15 or 30 carb increments. Even if they don't, it's still usually pretty easy to figure out with a little simple math.<br>  <br>  You can have oatmeal sweetened with fruit. I used to make myself baked macaroni and cheese in little oven safe bowls. ... just sit down and think about the types of foods you want to eat, and figure out how you can fit them together to make the amount of carbs you need for a meal or snack. You just need to plan ahead a little better.<br>  <br>  And don't forget ... no artificial sweeteners. I know it's tough, but you shouldn't use them while you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iK3YYRaTaa	All of the vegetables and fruits are raw, unless otherwise stated.

How many extra calories is that?<br>  <br>  I would stick to real sources of protein, like lean meats, fish and milk instead.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	1) Sure, but chocolate milk is just as good a recovery drink.  But with whey you get to experiment with different flavors and it's a convenient source of protein.<br>  <br>  2) Yes it will but it depends on the intensity of your workouts.  I don't know how much more a teenager can bulk up if they've only got 135 lbs to work with in the first place so I wouldn't expect to be 165lbs of body builder any time soon.<br>  <br>  3) The shake looks yummy.  Instead of Milk (and being redundant), I used to use orange juice and it made an excellent orange julius.  You might try peanut butter and chocolate (sugar free syrup)....<br>  <br>  4) Usually the rule of thumb is that if you work out you need to consume 1g-1.25g of protein for every pound of weight per day.  You can't 'overdose' on protein as your body excretes any excess, and it is unlikely that your body will have a protein shortage as it reuses celluar building blocks from damaged tissue as well.

Go to the drug store and talk to the pharmacist, they can recommend something that may help.  Otherwise, you may just have to tuff it out.

ONIa9Z17aa	You have to think of a good reason to do it. For me, I bought a gym membership even tho I hate the gym. but I'm cheap, so if I'm paying for it I'm damn well going to go. This works for me.  Maybe it can work for you, or else you can look at it as an investment in you health.  Maybe something like: You'll be a better mother if you can play more actively with your kids. Also, eating healthy will teach your kids good eating habits, making them healthier. <br>  I also really think about if I want what I eat, and when. Yes, I would like that ferrero rocher, but do I need to have it? will miss it if I don't? Plus, I'm about to go to bed and it'll take an age to work it off.<br>  <br>  So find a reason, and keep it in mind. Think of your kids, and cut your portions by a third. <br>  Goodluck|`|2gstVBcMaa	Honestly getting started is the hardest thing.  If i were you i would try to get into some sort of workout routine and ease your way into eating properly.  Because the BIGGEST motivation is when you put on those jeans that were a bit snug and now they fit just a bit better!  that right there, for me, is enough to keep me going another week.  I am not sure about your finances but as a single person i do not cook (and i am pretty bad at it too).  After seeing a good friend start to loose weight doing nutrisystem i decided what the heck and tried it too...AND WOW!!  It was super easy, the food was not bad and i did not have to worry about cooking.  I lost about 30lbs in 3 months.  No i am not a spam bot...lol.  And i actually have pictures to prove that i am a person who lost weight.  That was over a year ago and i am still doing great and eating healthier normal food now.  So anyway, you just have to make yourself and soon you will do it because you want to ..not because you have to. Good Luck|`|yXr3O7uDaa	Hey!

Such as borderline personality disorder, its basically a label for someone who is a step below mentally insane but is able to pay bills (sometimes) and converse normally with people. But they still don't know how to diagnose it or treat it. Its somewhat like bipolar and depression. Princess Diana was diagnosed with this disorder. <br>  <br>  Many of people use their "disease" or disorder as a crutch, which I think unless you are completely off the deep end is deplorable. I've seen people who say, "Well my son has ADHD so its ok for him to run around naked screaming and pulling people's hair." Excuse me? No, people with these "disorders" should be treated as you and me, there just has to be a different way of punishing or reprimanding them. When they are in trouble you must sit down with them and have a one on one. Eye contact. <br>  Because so many people use this as a crutch, society has formed around them & told itself that these people are different and should be treated at a higher or lower level than the "rest of us". They should only be treated different when it comes to things they do not excell in. Then things should be done to help them excell so they do not have this problem. It is poor teaching I believe because most people are not familiar with it so they shrink away and just tell the kids to be careful and play nice.

My eyes do the same thing when I am at the computer too long or doing one thing where a lot of my focus is for a long period of time.  It's nothing to worry about.  Mine usually goes away after sleeping.  I would suggest if it doesn't go away after a day or so maybe see your primary doctor.  It's no reason to stop playing video games though.  <br>  <br>  It also helps every once in a while to step away from the TV and give your eyes a breather.  And to remember to blink frequently when playing, often times we forget to blink when focused on the tv or computer.  (At least this is what my dr. says)

It's hard to do by yourself. I DONT think you should go cold turkey on this, although it's the healthiest and you'd only have to go through one massive withdraw ONCE. <br>  Start by eliminating cocaine. It's the worst of the 3. <br>  When you've accomplished this, eliminate ecstasy. <br>  Then, eliminate marijuana. It's the least harmful (well, studies say ecstasy is the least harmful but it will mess you up a LOT more). <br>  Of course, that not very thorough advice and likely won't get you far. <br>  Talk to your doctor, they will be able to refer you to treatment. You could choose to just see a councilor or go as far as a stint in rehab. <br>  If you choose to quit cold turkey, DO IT. Don't say, well, a tiny hit of this. When you've finished going through withdrawl, it'll be over. You don't want to have to go through it multiple times. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and you should read a million little pieces by james frey. Similar story.

First of all, you need to be familiar with the anatomy of a cut or scrape. When the upper layer of the skin is exposed by sudden force or a sharp object, a cut occurs . Then bleeding occurs, and if germs get into the cut (i.e. the cut makes contact with dirty hands) infection then can happen. <br>  <br>  Conversely, a scrape may occur through a sudden force rubbing against the upper layer of the skin, causing bleeding, and infection can happen through similar means. To prevent infection hydrogen peroxide for pain relief will be an effective means. <br>  <br>  The skin needs to be exposed to the air in order for it to be sufficiently healed, While a band aid can help protect against infection during the first day or so of the cut, but the cut will take longer to heal. The air itself helps dry up the residual blood with the help of the air and put the skin well on its way to healing. <br>  <br>  When it comes to the specific uses of hydrogen peroxide for pain relief, when the cut is throbbing with pain, when this happen they mean that it is in danger of getting an infection. The hydrogen peroxide not only cleans the wound, but also prevents infection. When the hydrogen peroxide makes contact with the air, the sting happens and it means that the germs in the cut are being killed. <br>  <br>  So, the next time when you are at your local convenience store, go to the first aid section and look at all of the ointments that are available. If you want a more natural form of healing for your cut, get an ointment with aloe in it. However, hydrogen peroxide is the choice for you if you want fast, effective healing.

F5cO0PbLaa	If your wrist is only sprained it should only take a couple of weeks to heal, provided you rest it. Just wait until it is better. You will be better off in the long run doing this, strapping it and pushing through the pain barrier will only prolong healing and possible further damage. If it doesnt look like it is getting better, see your doctor or physical therapist.<br>  <br>  A chiropractor can't help a sprained wrist. A sprained wrist is damage to the ligaments which support the wrist joint. No amount of "adjustment" will make it better.|`|xvPsAonzaa	You can use the straps and put them around your forearms instead of using the handles, this will actually target the biceps better than lifting through the wrist.

Good Luck!|`|YeBbtDW3aa	Good question, I have trained 5 to 6 days a week for almost two years now and have dealt with NUMEROUS bouts of soreness and pain. Unfortunately the only way to recover from such an injury is rest. Or if the pain has persisted for a long period of time you should consider seeing a chiropractor. I say chiropractor as opposed to a regular doctor for one reason: they are a lifters best friend. A normal medical doctor is more likely to give you pain pills which don't really fix the problem. A chiropractor will provide the proper adjustments to your body to help your wrist actually heal instead of masking the pain without curing it. Trust me, I go to mine at least one time a month due to my intense training regimen. I have had pain in both shoulders, knees, ankles, right elbow and left wrist. Also taking a cartilage repair supplement is paramount, such as Osteo Bi-Flex or something else with Glucosamine and Chondroitin. Hope this helps you some.

Good luck!|`|bjqjkDMHaa	I have had tics since I was seven but got diagnosed officially at age nine.<br>  I was sort of weirded out, like, I have this thing that is wrong with me?!  Then once I got over the initial shock, I was glad that there was a name to explain the weird little twitches I had and kind of relieved that it wasn't just something I should be able to control.  It used to be very mild, it was just an annoyance, like, my head would start to hurt when I nodded too much or  people would look at me funny in class at school because I couldn't stop grunting.  People would ask if I had hiccups or something, and my friends would sometimes stand up for me when kids picked on me over it.  Then two months ago, the sky fell out.<br>  Or at least it seemed like that.  I was sitting in band class when  my arms started moving.  The teacher in the next class sent me to the office to chill out for a while, but the desk worker called my mom because I really had no idea what was going on with my body.  Two days later, I spent my fourteenth birthday at the neurologist's office while the doctor talked to my parents, I sat on the exam table convulsing.  The doctor did nothing other than prescribe Risperdal.  It has been two months since, a trip to John Hopkins for their neurology program and I am still getting worse.  I've tried all the neuroleptics but cannot take them due to severe and scary reactions like dystonia and tardive dyskenesia.  My ability to walk is impaired due to hopping squatting and falling tics.  I shout profanity and hit myself with my fists as tics.  My whole life has fallen apart, all the normality disentegrated by the reality of this disorder. I don't know what happened, and nobody  can explain it.  Most people my age with TS are getting better, not worse.  All the doctors asked "has anything happened" but the answer is no, my life was getting better and I was on the way to new and good things before my arms started moving and I continue to get worse.  We are really at a loss, praying for an answer when no one can give us one.  The hot-shot neurologist from Hopkins has actually mentioned deep brain stimulation as a treatment if I don't get better.   We are really at a loss.  This is just my story, most people with TS are very mild and it is really just a mild annoyance or a slight embarassment when they are stressed.  Mine has taken over my life, comandeered my body.  I shout the n-word and other profanity in public as I ride in a wheelchair and calmly tell black people I don't mean anything about them, that I can't help it that I have to shout a racial insult.  I don't know if they believe me, I don't know if they are really offended, but I have been trying so hard to stay strong.  Every minute, I wonder: what will happen  next?  Will I put a fist through the wall?  Knock myself out as I punch myself in the jaw?  Will I fall on the floor before I get to the door of my room?  Will my pencil go flying as I start to flap my arms?  There is no relief, really.  I am very lucky so far that I can still type like this, going online and writing things and making beaded necklaces and playing piano or flute and singing are some of the things I do for fun that I can still do.  My life has changed a lot in the last two months, and I am starting to see what really matters.  My family is really suportive, and I really depend on them at this point.  I don't know if one minute I will be able to walk or if I will break my own ribs battering my chest with my fists.  <br>  I can calm down and be still for periods of time, but it always comes back when I get stressed.  Last night my dad and mom had to hold my wrists, restraining me so I didn't hurt myself.  <br>  Two months ago, I would have been thinking about going to high school in the fall, but now my main goal is to pull through until tomorrow.  It is such a roller coaster ride, every day, this disorder curses me and blesses me with the ups and downs, the sweet joy of every little victory over Tourette's and the bitter defeat and rage I feel when I pound my skull with my fists.  This is my life.  Everybody pays a price, and mine is paid in my experience with Tourette's.|`|cRdeb0T1aa	i was about sixteen when I discovered I had tourettes.  <br>  <br>  I was very relieved, because for the first time, my strangeness had a name.  I now knew WHY I ticced, and it made me feel .... not as odd, because suddenly, I knew why I did what I did.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't really affect my life.  I tic and go on with it.  The worst it's affected me is watching my son ticcing, and knowing that chances are, he'll have problems in school too.  (I made it through though)<br>  <br>  Peers, big problem.  I ticced, and because of that, people thought I was strange.  <br>  <br>  My husband supports me the most, he knows me and loves me.  He sees me tic and he can tell how stressful my day is by how bad my tics are.  He's awesome!<br>  <br>  None of my friends stopped talking to me, because I'm still the same person.

The highest calorie ones would be avocado- which are very good for you in small amounts- and bananas- which are also great for you. Go for the dark foods which contain the most vitamins, minerals and other good stuff which prevent heart disease and stroke, high BP/cholesterol, etc. Examples would be blueberries, strawberries, all the other berries, dark grapes, dark leafy lettuces, carrots, eggplant, broccoli and other cruciferous veggies, tomatoes, etc. Good luck and don't forget to also eat a wide variety of other healthy foods!

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|sZOiNdD5aa	if you really want to lose weight so fast, i think you need to take crevax, that was the most effective way to lose weight that i've tried so far, i've been using that for almost a month but you can see a noticeable results within a week.|`|mwtvYwzXaa	To be honest, there is no shortcuts in reducing weight.

BRDqfAy3aa	Don't panic!!! - There is a lot of medicine which can make you relaxed - to be drunk is also a solution (but really fully drunk! - ask your husband to do it BUT without planning! he should do it on any unexpected day!!!).<br>  By the way, read this:<br>  Vaginismus (the Latin equivalent of the word Vaginism) is a condition which affects a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration, including sexual penetration, insertion of tampons, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations. This is the result of a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, which is sometimes referred to as the "PC muscle". The reflex causes the muscles in the vagina to tense suddenly, which makes any kind of vaginal penetration—including sexual penetration—either painful or impossible.<br>  <br>  A vaginismic woman does not consciously control the spasm. The vaginismic reflex can be compared to the response of the eye shutting when an object comes towards it. The severity of vaginismus and the pain during penetration, including sexual penetration, varies from woman to woman.<br>  Read more below|`|gUCjkj9oaa	could be psychological or maybe you have sjogren's ,see an gynaecologist.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	It seems that the only way is to get you relaxed and if that entitles you getting drunk, don't get to the falling down throwing up point just so your feeling no pain drunk, and then try it, do a lot of foreplay and maybe use small toys to stretch out a bit before the main event.|`|rAQADfSvaa	From personal experience it took about 10 tries before it was actually comfortable, pain-free and enjoyable. Sex is supposed to hurt in the beginning, but it hurts a lot more if you're tense and dry. The best thing to do is use LOTS of lube and explain to your husband to take it REAL slow! Don't forget foreplay, as that will help loosen you up for lack of better words. Don't get drunk...You can get through this - trust me!|`|zu0W6hCTaa	sounds like u need to start masturbating. go buy a small sex toy and work ur way up. But in all honesty, i think ur just paraniod.|`|woOeYFrEaa	You need to see a psychologist.  I'd imagine that maybe you were sexually abused at some point?  Its normal to be a little fearful of pain but what you're describing needs to be addressed by a professional counselor, not just a doctor who tells you that you have fear and you should relax.  There's a reason you're so afraid and you need to work past that.<br>  <br>  Until you get past your fear, I don't know that anything will help.  You'd probably have to drunk to the point of almost being unconcious to not be fearful.  Fear causes you to clamp those muscles down and it'll be painful every time until you can get past that fear.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|WrXQfYTeaa	Try lubricant, or drinking or smoking, as those can really calm you down a bit. Have you spoken to a psychiatrist, because that could seriously help. Find one that is under your insurance, if you have it, and go see him or her.

Sex can be very painful especially if it is your first time. You are lucky because like me you seem to have a supportive husband. Have you tried to start the sexual process, by not having penetrative sex, but oral sex?<br>  <br>  That is usually quite a good start, as it helps the couple relax, enjoy themselves and get to know more about each other's 'equipment'. Light some candles, put on some music and switch off phones. Then make it very clear that it's just teasing and experimenting, no actual sex.<br>  <br>  A lot of times, especially when you come from a strong religious background (like me) young women are almost driven to be afraid of sex and the penis. Of course when you are married that can become a problem.<br>  <br>  Whilst you are enjoying oral sex (it is very pleasurable, does not hurt one bit, just make sure you are both clean, so that you feel confident and not embarrased by bodily odours), why not try some more intimacy techniques to bring you closer to your goal?<br>  <br>  You can take a bath together, cook each other meals, give massages, kiss, lick, tickle and touch all body areas. You can also buy one of those sexy boardgames to have fun!<br>  <br>  Then when you have your period, maybe in stead of a sanitary towel, try using a tampon (always go for mini, as it is ideal for women like us). Make sure you use lubricant to aleviate any pain and insert it slowly. Do that until you feel comfortable. Remember it is your hand insering it and you can remove it if necessary very simply.<br>  <br>  When you feel comfortable with this why not try to allow your husband to finger you? (again make sure hands are clean and nails cut).Tell your husband to be gentle and go at your pace. The penis is similar in a way to a finger and a tampon (but feels much better!) it just takes time getting used to the idea.<br>  <br>  You need to do all this at your own pace and with baby steps if necessary. Don't be afraid, if your husband loves you he will wait. After all you waited for him. And please don't get drunk. <br>  <br>  Penetrative sex without foreplay will be painful. So always make sure that your husband does his duty to you, by turning you on with oral sex, foreplay, romance and love. Then the time will come with God's will when you will be ready, because your body will.<br>  <br>  Remember be as comfortable around each other to help this. Be naked together just touching, say romantic things to each other, watch a film that will put you in the mood...<br>  <br>  I am married for 10 years now (I am 27) and sex was and is painful if I do not do all these. But my husband is gentle, we use lubricant, have lots of foreplay and then I am hungry for him and wet enough.<br>  <br>  If you suffer from dryness, use lots of lubricant and start the penetration just with the head for a while. When you are ready you can go for it, full force!<br>  <br>  I hope that helpsand if you need any more advice, please let me know.|`|ldB0Fyo2aa	You poor thing. You're right, it's easy to say "relax", but when you've built up such a phobia over two years, that would be impossible. Have you considered counseling? You know, you may have twisted up your heart into so much pain about this, you might need some help getting things worked out. Don't think about it as a sexual problem, think about it as a real fear that you, a counselor and your husband can work to unravel. <br>  <br>  Yes, alcohol might help, but I'd hate to see you start drinking just for that. And the doctor said there was nothing wrong at all? I hate to be graphic here, but has your hymen been broken yet? If it hasn't, then yes, it's going to hurt at first. Maybe the doctor can prescribe a pain relieving cream for the first time. I know someone who had to have her hymenal ring, the opening a little deeper into the vagina, enlarged, so that sex wasn't painful. It was an outpatient surgery that worked wonders. Have you tried all the "tingling" lubricants they advertise on tv? <br>  <br>  If you've tried lubricants (which are absolutely necessary if you're not producing your own...otherwise sex would hurt anyone!), and you're sure it's not physical, then please consider looking into some counseling. You deserve to have a loving sexual relationship with your partner, but you don't need to take on any more guilt for it not working. I hope you can heal your fears and grow with your husband into a healthier place. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!|`|8JPDOXagaa	It sounds to me the your doctor is right.<br>  You need to seek some help, you should never dread sex this much!<br>  Why dont you find out whether your Doctor can refer you to get some help - perhaps therepy ..

My doctor told me I had a tilted uterus which was causing the penis to hit my cervix at the wrong angle. I had to go to several doctors before I found one to help me, I didn't meet my husband until I was 26 and had seen 4 or 5 gyno's before who never said anything about a tilted uterus. I had surgery to fix it and it worked until after I had my daughter. The pain has slowly returned, she is 18 months old.<br>  <br>  You have to be your own advocate. If you feel like something is wrong, don't give up until you find a professional that can help you. You may have to open your mind and think of unconventional types of care. Try a chiropractor or acupuncture. Your spine being out of whack can effect countless things in your body. A really good chiropractor can help you with total body wellness.

ZB9zkbxxaa	Aluminium chloride is used in regular antiperspirants. However hyperhidrosis sufferers need solutions with a much higher concentration to effectively treat the symptoms of the condition. Its main secondary effect is that it can cause irritation. Also, the solution is usually not effective for hand and foot hyperhidrosis. For severe cases of palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis there is some success using conservative measures such as aluminium chloride antiperspirants[citation needed].<br>  <br>  Botulinum toxin type A injections are used to disable the sweat glands. The effects can last from 4-9 months depending on the site of injections. The procedure when used for underarm sweating has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br>  <br>  Several anticholinergic drugs reduce hyperhidrosis. Oxybutynin (brand name Ditropan ) is one that has shown promise. although it has important side effects, which include drowsiness, visual symptoms and dryness in the mouth and other mucus membranes. A time release version of the drug is also available (Ditropan XL ), with purportedly reduced effectiveness. Glycopyrrolate (Robinul) is another drug used on an off-label basis. The drug seems to be almost as effective as oxybutynin and have similar side-effects. Other anticholinergic agents that have been tried include propantheline bromide (Probanthine ) and benzatropine (Cogentin ).<br>  <br>  Antidepressants and anxiolytics were formerly used on the belief that primary hyperhidrosis was related to an anxious personality style. Beta-blockers have also been tried, but do not seem to be very effective.
BdlGBdE5aa	You still have bad breath because you are not dealing with the real cause of bad breath.  The major cause of bad breath is the tongue not the teeth.  Bacteria grow on the top of the tongue and produce the bad smells.  You can often see these bacteria by looking on the top of your tongue for a white substance.  This white stuff must be removed if you are going to get rid of bad breath.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

VzPMVu53aa	Doubt it.  Judging from your question I'm guessing your arms are still sore long after your workout.  You're symptoms are likely due to Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, abbreviated as DOMS.  In a nutshell, this usually occurs when you overwork your muscles during exercise, causing enough damage that is made worse by your body's inflammatory response to the damage.  <br>  <br>  The best method to prevent DOMS is simply not to overdo your exercise.  Aside from that, some light (and I mean very light) exercise can help the repair process by facilitating blood flow to the area.  The symptoms themselves should go away within a week.|`|wGTisY1aaa	Muscle soreness <br>  <br>            A certain degree of muscle soreness or pain may be experienced after a workout. Muscle soreness that occurs directly after a workout is known as acute muscle soreness. Acute muscle soreness may last up to hour following exercise and may dissipate soon after. The cause of acute muscle soreness or inflammation may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the muscle and an accumulation of metabolic byproducts like hydrogen ions or lactic acid. Recovery follows when enough oxygen gets to the muscle. Post-exercise muscle soreness (PEMS) or delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) happens when the muscles are sore 12-48 hours after exercise. Some soreness is alright, but excruciating pain is not. If you experience slight discomfort from soreness, you can help alleviate the pain by placing ice on the sore area and stretching while you have the ice pack on. Stretching with the ice pack is on will help relive some of the tightening of the sore muscle the next morning. This is nothing to get freaked out about. Our bodies undergo the processes of inflammation, repair and remodeling in response to the stress imposed by training. This will occur even when you use right form and technique. If you do feel excruciating pain you may need to; call your doctor right away.<br>  <br>  Recuperation tips<br>  <br>  Pre-training<br>   Before we discuss aspirin, I have to stress to allows follow your doctors orders before taking any medications. Aspirin is not something to take all of the time. If you know that you are not supposed to take anything like aspirin then this tip is not for you. Don’t feel like you have to do this, this is only a tip for those who can take aspirin. <br>        Aspirin operates on a variety of levels. It helps to improve blood flow by reducing the body’s output of thromboxane, a natural which causes blood platelets to become stickier. Research has proven that smaller doses of aspirin are as effective as larger doses with less possibility of stomach irritation. To protect your stomach lining even better crush of the aspirin between two spoons and add them to a glass of milk. Aspirin also reduces edema (swelling) after hard training. You should try to only take aspirin on the heavier training days if you can take aspirin. Once again< I cannot stress the importance of following your doctors orders first. I cannot be responsible for you not doing so.<br>        Leg elevation is another way to help the blood flow to our legs. Many people today spend eight or more hours sitting at their desks and their legs become swollen. Spend 20-30 minutes a day, both during the work day and prior to your leg and/or your lower body workout with your back on the floor and your legs up against the wall or up against the side of a couch or chair. The gravity helps to return the blood back up to the heart, restoring optimum circulation. Doing so will help promote an important physical and psychological transition between work and training.<br>  <br>  Recovery during training<br>  <br>           Time between sets is important. You must always take no less than a minute break between sets. You can also follow your heart rate. Everyone is different in this area. Usually when you “feel ready” it is alright to start the nest set.<br>         Movement between sets is important. It is not a good idea to sit down or do as little as possible. The movement could be considered the cool-down from the previous set and the warm-up for the next set. This practice aids circulation and helps reduce swelling of muscular tissues.<br>  <br>  Post-training recovery  <br>  <br>          Contrast showers are done immediately after training. Expose your lower lumbar area to alternating hot and cold water- as hot as you can stand it for two minutes followed by progressively colder water, almost to the point of discomfort.<br>            Cryokentics is another way to help ease any discomfort. Immediately after leaving the shower, construct an ice bag by placing crushed ice in a Zip-lock bag. Lie down on the floor with your feet propped up on the couch and place the bag under your lumbar spine. To improve the effect of this procedure threefold, try stretching your spine while on the ice. Gently perform side to side flexions alternated with pulling your knees to your chest. Mobilizing your spine, this way will help counteract the stiffness that you may have experienced icing your back in the past.|`|AA10230143	It will go away in a couple days and youll be brand new again and stronger at that!!|`|fEKCRmv8aa	During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, lactate is produced faster than the ability of the tissues to remove it and lactate concentration begins to rise. This is a beneficial process since the regeneration of NAD+ ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. The increased lactate produced can be removed in a number of ways including<br>  <br>  oxidation to pyruvate by well-oxygenated muscle cells which is then directly used to fuel the citric acid cycle, <br>  conversion to glucose via the Cori cycle in the liver through the process of gluconeogenesis. <br>  Contrary to popular belief, this increased concentration of lactate does not directly cause acidosis, nor is it responsible for delayed onset muscle soreness.[1] This is because lactate itself is not capable of releasing a proton, and secondly, the acidic form of lactate, lactic acid, cannot be formed under normal circumstances in human tissues.[citations needed] Analysis of the glycolytic pathway in humans indicates that there are not enough hydrogen ions present in the glycolytic intermediates to produce lactic or any other acid.
EUTRJqCsaa	you'll need to see your ob/gyn. the first time I would assume they might insert it to show you how, but after that you'll need to. to my understanding, you keep it in for three weeks, take it out for the fourth to have a period, then put in a new one.

Long term effects are insomnia and delirium, chronic renal failure, sepsis and there is quite a few more. Treatment is to come off it and adjust to without it slowly.

I'm sure you have gum disease but I don't know about rotten teeth.  Go see a dentist!|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Read the above answers to your question and see a dentist.  In addition, you probably need to clean your tongue to remove the bacteria that grows there and causes bad breath.  You can look for this bacteria on the top of your tongue.  It is generally white in color and there is more in the back of your tongue.  This white stuff must be cleaned off if you want to get rid of bad breath.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner.  Here is their site: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|4c7QomPoaa	Bad breath isn't always an indicator of problems with your teeth but if if they hurt and bleed you might want a dentist to look at them. .

People with college degrees are fighting for jobs that people with high school degrees had. People with high school degrees are fighting for jobs that part-time high schoolers had. You might have to settle for something other then what you went majored in school. Or you might have to move to a different location in order to pursue your desired career. Keep your head up!!! We will eventually work our way out of this economic mess!!!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	everything can change quickly. You can put your stuff or craigslist & find the right buyers. You can suddenly find you get the right job. If it makes you feel better & you have the time just take another job while you are waiting. You will be bringing in a check & meeting people who may be the lead to your job. Most successful people went through hard times. Tyler Perry (he writes, acts, etc, in the Madea movies) was homeless. Find people who have had rags to richs stories & stay focused on them. There is so much nagativity here so be careful. Hang around your friends who are making money & if they are doing work that doesn't require an education do what they are doing. My son has an education & is doing very well so you just might have to wait to use it but know it is not a waste. Matt Laur from Good Morning America applied for a job as a trash man or something like that & he thought was getting the call for that when GMA called him. You are not at all alone. Keep focused on President Obama if you live in the USA b/c he is doing what is best for us. If you listen to Rush or Fox they just want to upset people. They work for the drug companies.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	I know where you're coming from - I am in exactly the same position.

I'm an out of work pilot that's been looking for work for nearly a year.<br>  <br>  It's just a tough market out there right now.  You've got to get by the best you can.

But, if that's what I would have had to do I would have done it.)<br>  <br>  I'm planning on going back to school to get a Master's degree so I'm a little more marketable in another field.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, it's not you.  We'll get through it.  It's just going to be a little tough.  Take some time to enjoy not having a job.

You must branch out to survive.  My husband is an Audio Engineer for Live Sound.  He graduated 8 years ago and still can't find a job that fits his degrees.  So, he runs laser shows.  He works as a tech for a science museum.  He also works security at another place.  He's not really fullfilled, but eventually he will be.  He's a hard worker.  He did a stint at Radio Shack even.<br>  Keep plugging away.  It can be hard, but if you keep wanting it badly and putting yourself out there you'll make it.  Don't begrudge your peers who didn't go college.  Eventually you will make enough money to be comfortable and maybe even support a family.

sIv9gaolaa	Yeah I think you do qualify. My friend had it done but at her first GP appointment she told her mainly about how she hated men staring and felt self conscious. The GPs answer was "how do you know that will disappear when you have a breast reduction?".

Some of your problem might be an ill fitting bra and that will make everything worse.  Also remember that any surgery will bring its own risks (e.g. infection) and lots of pain.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Yes, I think you will qualify.  My daughter's friend had hers reduced on the NHS|`|ODvnyAdlaa	yes i think you would go and see your doctor who can get you a referal.

In the first instance you have got to go see your GP and stress how difficult things are for you and he/she should put you on to someone else and take it from there. Good Luck.|`|emUJYL0caa	yes my friend is on the waiting list to have hers reduced, she is 22 and a f cup, but she would probably only be a size 10 if it wasn't for her bust. she always gets stares and jokes about her boobs and she has real bad backache.|`|ZCCZT9agaa	Yes I think you should qualify. Damn that huge.Yes you should get a reduction because thats a little to damn big. good luck with that.|`|vw2FpFn9aa	I dont know much about this sort of thing but reading the information above, I cant see why they would say no!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|VrMetP9Maa	I'll say go for it|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Yes, you will, unless you are overweight, in which case they might tell you to lose weight first.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Yes, you're likely to get the surgery if they cause you back pain.
EN32vSsCaa	Your brother is addicted to 'pot'.  Otherwise he would not have hid a jar of pot in the car.  Your parents are allowing him (enabling) to continue his addiction.<br>  <br>  For all those who believe marijuana is not addictive:<br>  Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit.

He obviously doent want to quit so hes making you think hes addicted.|`|uuWTr7N9aa	I will honestly say i am also a huge pot head and along with many of my friends and quitting is hard. I'm still young and pot doesnt really get in the way of much right now, but being 19 years old it might get in the way of a lot of things. I would say if your brother had something to occupy his time, i'm not saying he doesnt, but if he doesn't have much then it would be a good idea to start a time consuming hobby, like a sport. Also i think once you smoke a lot and become addicted and once you are free from it after a couple of days you feel extremelyyy "free." If he could get that "free" feeling then that might help him not want to do it anymore.

1tjJPHpMaa	you don't need to lose any weight
9BbV2xqIaa	what specifically do you not like about your body?<br>  <br>  if you think you are overweight/underweight and would like to lose/gain weight until you are healthy, you should see a doctor in order to determine your ideal weight. once you know what that is, and a doctor IS the best place to find this out (unfortunately), you can change your lifestyle and eating habits to be physically healthier.<br>  <br>  if this is about skin issues, a dermatologist could probably give you some cream/gel to help with that. I have a few friends who had *crazy* acne but it got better once they used the right products on their skin.<br>  <br>  this could make a difference in how you feel about yourself, leading to less self-loathing and more comfort in the skin you're in. however, if your issues with how you look aren't based in reality, then this may be something that you need to really think about: *why* are you upset about your body?<br>  <br>  also, if your mother says stuff that is just putting you further down, you need to tell her that. possibly just write something out similar to this question saying:<br>  <br>  hey mom, you know when you tell me I am worthless, won't graduate, (and the like) it makes me cry more, and it makes me feel worse about myself.<br>  <br>  the reason you're even upset is because you feel bad about yourself right? and it's not at all right for your own mother to make you feel worse!<br>  <br>  also: if your own mother is treating you like this, is there another adult who you can talk to. or an older sibling/friend. maybe a school counselor? you could call a local mental health line, and if by chance your region has a computer chat mental health like (know mine does), that might be better since you are obviously good with using the computer. plus, no one will be able to overhear you.<br>  <br>  edit: ahhh, I see. hm, that is not too great then. do you think you would feel better if you exercised? personally I think 115 is probably pretty skinny, depending on how tall you are. anyways, that obviously isn't the problem<br>  <br>  re talking to others: if you don't have anyone else to talk to then that sucks. and btw, I have the same issue, since I can't read or write my mothertongue (Tamil) and my mom's English isn't so spectacular. hmmmm.... that really does put you in a rut... I'm sorry :/<br>  <br>  edit2: no problem, too bad I can't really help you anymore though :/ I just wish there were an easy solution to this... sounds like you're in a fix if you can't write the letter though.

4GNNOQeLaa	First off, sorry to hear that you have lost your insurance, there is not an OTC option for thyroid replacement.  First a little information about Thyroid hormone.  Normally the thyroid gland produces T3 and T4.  The body can convert T4 to T3.  Synthroid or generic Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of T4 and Cytomel supplements T3.  You would need to speak with your Dr. but I think you can increase your dose of Synthroid and discontinue the expensive Cytomel.  Speak with your doctor, I'm sure he or she will understand your situation and change your medication dosage

My son had this same issue until we removed gluten from our diet. Many doctors misdiagnose and treat for other issues. Celiac was thought to be very rare until the last few years, now it is diagnosed at 1 in 133 people or so. Many people that are intolerant to gluten are also intolerant of milk.<br>  <br>  To test the theory, you can make your diet basic. Meat and veggies, no breads or breading.

If these symptoms occur, seek immediate emergency medical aid.

Eat small meals and avoid or cut back on aspirin, coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol. Avoid wearing tight belts and other constrictive clothing. Wait at least two hours before lying down after eating. Also, avoid bending over immediately after a meal. If heartburn occurs after going to bed, use extra pillows or elevate the head of the bed.

The condition typically lasts less than 30 or 60 seconds, and causes a partial blocking of breathing in, while breathing out remains easier. It may be triggered when the vocal cords or the area of the trachea below the cords detects the entry of water, mucus, blood, or other substance. It is characterized by stridor and or retractions. Some people suffer from frequent laryngospasms, whether awake or asleep. In an ear, nose and throat practice, it is typically seen in people who have silent reflux disease.

HyPp4VOpaa	Hooah soldier! I spent 5 years in the United States Army and loved every minute of it! As a Paramedic on a Blackhawk, it prepared me for my civilian job as a Paramedic. Chances are I would still be in if I hadn't injured my knees. But to the point, BCT (Basic Combat Training) is the most physically demanding event most people will ever have to endure in their life, but i guarantee you that you will NEVER once in BCT see weights. My advice to you soldier, would be to begin a regimen of Push-ups, Sit-ups, and Running. These three events are part of the APFT (Army Physical Fitness Test), which each soldier needs to take prior to completion of BCT and will also take on a regular basis while serving. This consists of 2 minutes of push-ups, 2 minutes of sit-ups, and a 2 mile run. So my suggestion, stick with those three exercises, get as good as possible at them, and in three years you will be able to top out the APFT before even entering BCT! Good luck to you soldier!|`|znLzOCHlaa	Ya, if'n you eat good. Then, when you are out of the army, you could be a police officer. They hire people from the army, and you have a much better chance of getting and keeping a job like that. And, you will be able to pass the physical tests with ease.|`|CMDnwVuUaa	Yes if you keep improving and try doing more and more weights you will definately be i top condition for the army in 3 years you will be amazingl|`|oa3Y7Xltaa	Listen friend, your doing the right thing here. But to be in the army you need to be fit. Make sure that you do a fair amount of running to gain fitness. Just have your protein, carbs etc and you will be fine the weights will defintley sort your shape. BUT REMEMBER WITHOUT THE PROTEIN YOUR NOT GOING TO BUILD THE MUSCLE YOU WANT.

AG9msdUDaa	Meds are not the answer, I have been on several from all classes of psychotropic drugs and they actually changed me from a depressed 16 year old girl going through a break up to a crazed ***** that attempted suicide three times between the ages of 16 and 27 which is when I stopped taking ANY psychotropic drugs. Also, my mom is on 5 at the SAME TIME and she is literally dying from an infection because these drugs compromise your immune system so badly in high doses and she will NOT stop taking them she is so hooked!<br>  <br>  What finally fixed things for me was reading up on the CAUSE of depression and anxiety. It sounds to me like you are low on magnesium as this can cause headaches/migraines, racing heart and reduces your ability to handle stress.<br>  <br>  Doctors never look at the nutritional status, it takes too much work. It is easier to throw a pill at you with 15-100 side effects, many of which you are going to get, and only one other possible effect that you are not likely to get, which is treatment of the anxiety/depression.<br>  <br>  Go to a Natural Doctor for all relevant testing, including food allergy tests and toxic load tests as they are very important to your mood. You can try asking your doctor for these too, but you don't have to even ask and ND because they know better.<br>  <br>  You will need a General Metabolic Profile, Food allergy test and hair analysis for toxins, then you can design a therapy that will likely not be a life long treatment once the imbalance in your body is remedied.<br>  <br>  Exercise does help too, but if you do have a deficiency and you are not changing to a healthier diet along with the exercise, you will exacerbate the deficiencies and your mood could get worse and you will start to weaken your immune system.|`|oojO4WAraa	Happiness is a choice.  You are the one in charge of your thoughts.  If you think negative thoughts it is your own fault.  <br>  <br>  Get more exercise because it helps greatly with anxiety and depression.  30-60 minutes a day - you will notice improvement within 2 weeks.  And there are no bad side effects.<br>  <br>  Also - get control of your thoughts.  When you find yourself thinking negative thoughts - think of something else.  It is up to you what is in your head.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit - I was depressed, even suicidal, for years and then started walking.  It changed my life.  Now I ride my bike an hour (10 miles) every day and walk (3 miles) when I can't ride.  It has changed my life.|`|53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	You are not alone with this.  I have had anxiety where I had from the moment I woke up till I went to bed.  I have even had it in my sleep and would wake up from it.  My mind raced so much it was hard to tell what was real and what was from the anxiety. I went on meds and it all went away.  After a couple years I went off of them and then a couple months later it all started up again this time with depression.  I went back on my meds. and started counseling which has helped but I am still working thru this.  The meds. do help but it is true that you have to put a lot of effort into it too.  So you don't feel bad, negative thoughts are something you need to work on and it is not easy when you anxiety BUT just telling yourself to be happy doesn't make it go away.  People have told me to be happy, just relax, get over it, etc. If it was that easy why wouldn't we do that.  So I understand what you are going thru. Find a good psychiatrist and counselor.  It sometimes takes med changes to find the right one. I tried 5 different ones.  Then you have to find the right dose and it also takes time for the meds to get in your system.  I am still working thru mine although it is better.  Have hope because it does get better if you seek out help and put alot of work into yourself.  You are not alone nor are you crazy.  It is what you said it is anxiety and depression.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	Here is an incredible statistic - 1 in 4 of the population will suffer from some form of anxiety disorder at some time during their lifetime.<br>  <br>  So you are most definitely NOT alone - there is an army of us all with you!!<br>  <br>  Here is a site where you may find some answers.<br>  <br>  Remember, YOU ARE NOT ALONE - we have all been there.
C6X9peAoaa	Hey! First things first! Calm down. Just relax a little and take a few deep breaths. Confidence is a funny thing isn't it?!? Sometimes we have it sometimes we don't. I am a person that suffers badly at times from anxiety and slight depression. I find that doing things I enjoy doing take my mind of the things that get me down. Hence why I am on here now. Keeping myself busy. It all comes down to how we all react to situations that are presented to us. If we took 50 people and gave them the same situation you may find that 3/4 of them reacted in a completely different way. If someone insults you, you may react in a way which makes you feel badly in yourself. were as the next person might take the insult and just walk away and not give it a second thought!  Someone else might turn around and smack the insulter! Its all down to us. Ex mates, you said it! Why are they Ex mates? They obviously are no good for you so why listen to what they have to say, or even better laugh it off. They are still giving you attention and as long as you react to it they most likely will continue! As for your tan lines! Lucky you going skiing! I'd kill to do that! Most likely they are jealous of you! <br>  <br>  As for your presentation, I recommend that your become confident in what it is your presenting. Practice it till you know it inside out. Then when you have to do it, concentrate and just do it like you have practiced many times before. If someone interrupts you then stop. Take a breath and then continue after they have stopped. They will look the fool if you don't react! Its good to have people looking at you. Its a good sign they are engaging in what your doing so don't let that throw you!<br>  <br>  Get in touch with the guy from France if you have contact details, if you ddon't, dont worry, chances are another person will be just around the corner! Life will get better I promise you! Just keep your chin held high and enjoy the highs and lows of life!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and didn't ramble too much!|`|XoRkPaa1aa	I agree, you sound young. Your'e not gonna kill yourself, and you don't hate your life. You're just hormonal, and under developed. We've all had these feelings about insignificant things (I hate presentations too!) but as you get older, you'll realize no one's staring at you, and no one really cares how you look or how you sound except for you.|`|Bdu0hZcsaa	You are obviously a teenager with a few problems.  Believe me honey, I had a fair few of them when i was growing up, i was bullied like mad in school.  You are suffering low confidence, and i bet you are so intellegant and so pretty and you dont even know it.  The advice i would give  you is to study as much as possible and do the best you can exam wise in school.  Try to ignore the stupid people who are teasing you about tan marks on your face, they are obviously brain deads.  Not worth thinking about and will probably end up cleaning toilets somewhere if they are lucky.  As for the voice shaking when reading, i had the same thing in school.  I suffered terrible panick attacks.  In retrospect, you should have  quiet word with your english teacher and explain you feel very anxious about reading and ask not to be picked to read right now.  That is not weird, its perfectly ok to do that.  If you are feeling really depressed and like you will run away or do worse, you need to ask your mum to go to a doctor and get some help.  Things will get be tter and you will actually do really well in life.  I had all those problems, shyness, being bullied, nervous speaking in public (everyone is though), and I've done really well in life and i used to get really crap results in school.  You have loads to look forward tom, honestly you have.  Life gets better.  And you are perfectly normal, not nuts or not in anyway strange.  Get help sweetheart if you are miserable.  Lots of people do and probably loads do in your form aswell, but you dont know that because they dont discuss it.  Best of luck to you.|`|IajU0k0Saa	Your problem, its really bad, I think this is on par with people who have been raped, molested or had a close person die.

JvOL7y2Kaa	I don't think this is porno talk.  This is a legit question.<br>  <br>  Depends on how small and also depends on how the hymen is shaped.<br>  <br>  not all hymen are shaped the same.  Some are on the sides on the opening, some are in the middle, some are on the top and bottom.  So it really depends on how the intercourse was done.  Also, it is very possible for some hymen to remain behind after the first few times of intercourse.  Meaning it is not completely broken thru.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|6zDYJRjmaa	i guess its possible, unless its <br>  THAT small|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	heres how it works<br>  <br>  the hymen doesn't always break with the first intercourse, whether it breaks or not is a bit irrelevant to the act of having sex, just concentrate on having a good time, not a little membrane of skin, why is that so important to you that it breaks anyway? hehe!<br>  <br>  please use protection! you can get pregnant on your first time!<br>  <br>  Also, don't overreact or get upset if nothing happens. On some cases the Hymen doesn't break, has been broken through masturbation and she didn't realize it, or it isn't that apparent. With my girlfriend when we had sex for the first time, she was a virgin and there was no bleeding or anything of that nature, just mild uncomfortable pain from her first time and insertion.|`|XxUIOZdIaa	it doesn't matter how small unless its THAT small. but other wise yes it could.|`|uvLU3JPjaa	yes|`|zWX5GDehaa	yes|`|U531TVPOaa	was it human?|`|OntE0pjhaa	well that depends...the usual answer would be "ummm, sure" but it really comes down to your usual habits. If you do masturbate let's say moderately your hymen may or may not break due to the fact that it has been used to "movement". I'm a guy so I don't really know how to describe it but imagine it like a used tennis shoe...even if it's a bit tight at first it loosens up after a bit of "usage" (in your case that would be masturbation)|`|NqnF1KYbaa	i think so. i mean ur hymen is like right there and if he inserts it in when he's erect even if he's little, he can still tear it. but some hymen are different adn sometimes he can miss it and it wont tear. but he might if he goes in again.|`|Nh9ts9joaa	yes it can a guys dick doesn't have to be big for it to break your hymen most guys brag about having big ***** but their dick only goes in your hyman up to a certain point their is no dick that can not break it|`|HBx6q05Oaa	If the wee lad achieved penetration, then yes, you may have broke your hymen.|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	How small are we talking here?!?

PI8VfiY1aa	It's unknown as to whether or not telepathy is possible. But one must question why, without the common pretense of religious advocation, this phenomenon has been so thoroughly researched for over a century if it were false.  <br>  <br>  Recently, new theories have arisen to suggest that telepathy has a scientific explanation rooted in quantum mechanics (1)(2)(3). This is apparently linked to the theory of quantum entanglement and other areas of theoretical physics (4)<br>  <br>  If 300 years ago, you were to tell someone that their brain was a system of chemical and electrical reactions- that what they called "love" was really a chemical in the brain called oxytocin, they surely would've declared you insane.

AG9msdUDaa	Wow De Mac what a load. IT IS PART OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM:<br>  <br>  <br>  "Lymphoid tissue begins to accumulate in the appendix shortly after birth and reaches a peak between the second and third decades of life, decreasing rapidly thereafter and practically disappearing after the age of 60. During the early years of development, however, the appendix has been shown to function as a lymphoid organ, assisting with the maturation of B lymphocytes (one variety of white blood cell) and in the production of the class of antibodies known as immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. Researchers have also shown that the appendix is involved in the production of molecules that help to direct the movement of lymphocytes to various other locations in the body."|`|ed6dd97680f16853ceee083850fe8bd6aa	Mesenteric adentitis is a well recognised reason for an incorrect diagnosis of appendicitis. It simply means that the lymph nodes (glands) in the mesentery (part of the tissue, the peritoneum, that supports and covers the bowel) are inflamed. This can happen with a simple viral infection. It clears up without treatment.<br>  Usually, once the abdomen has been entered, the surgeon will remove the appendix.

BG8vMyZjaa	Digestive enzymes, available as over-the-counter supplements, help digest carbohydrates and may allow people to eat foods that normally cause gas.<br>  <br>  The enzyme lactase, which aids with lactose digestion, is available in caplet and chewable tablet form without a prescription; Lactaid and Lactrase are two common brands. Taking lactase supplements just before eating helps digest foods that contain lactose. Also, lactose-reduced milk and other products, such as Lactaid and Dairy Ease, are available at many grocery stores.<br>  <br>  Beano, an over-the-counter digestive aid, contains the sugar-digesting enzyme that the body lacks to digest the sugar in beans and many vegetables. The enzyme comes in liquid and tablet form. Five drops are added per serving or one tablet is swallowed just before eating to break down the gas-producing sugars. Beano has no effect on gas caused by lactose or fiber.<br>  <br>  There is much more information on the site listed below.|`|3EmsD4y7aa	Stop eating beans , silly !|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Lmao!

Go to the doc. Good Luck!|`|lXEvMuJBaa	Alcohol in any amount is a contributor.  There are so many OTC drugs for this condition (because it is so common.)  Have you tried any?  If nothing helps, see your doctor, it could be something more serious (although doubtful!)  Good luck!|`|IOXLASr3aa	I can offer two solutions for you.. One is eat more fiber like fiber one and also maybe take beano.. That will help you with the gas hopefully these help you. Theres a third on try dan active it will help your digestive tract.|`|DKzadEW7aa	This looks like a job for BEANO!! Use beano and there will beano gas!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, use it, it will help, and if it doesn't, try pepto bysmal<br>  <br>  hope this works for you :)
