If Taro Aso resigns due to his unpopularity in the polls, should Shoichi Nakagawa compete for the leadership of the LDP and become Prime Minister? I think he would be a much more competent PM than any of the current diet members of the LDP. He has handled his finance portfolio well, apart from being tired at a conference he has done a decent job sorting out the mess of the Japanese economy.       I say if it was Nakagawa vs. Ozawa in the next election, Nakagawa will win.

20090128105318AAmycoI	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	Ireland travel section, how do you give an Irishman an exorcism?	He came to visit me from Dublin and we spent the day together in NYC. We went to the zoo, to the museum, ice skating and to Central Park. I also drove all the way to upstate New York to take him to the super Walmart that sells guns and is open 24 hours a day, just to give him a piece of real Americana. When we got back to New Jersey, we both wore black leather trousers with our names written in rhinestones on the back while we wrestled in oil. Now I'm afraid something is wrong with him as he's been speaking in tongues and acting crazy. I gagged him, tied him up to a chair and tried to pour a circle of salt around him but I didn't have enough salt, so I just used powdered sugar. I called up every church in my city asking if they'd perform an exorcism on an Irishman but they all hung up on me. The only help I could find was a Mexican dwarf witch doctor in Newark with one eye and a hook hand. He said he'd need to use a stretching machine and an arsenal of laxatives and suppositories to perform the exorcism. He also stated that he wanted to be paid with all of the wisdom teeth both the Irishman and me had, which he said he would pull out with a wrench himself. I'm not sure what to do? Can't I just tie him to a wheelchair and take him to the Irish embassy in NYC and let them deal with it?      Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

Basically, I'm (hopefully) going to Florida on holiday in just over two weeks, so when I learned that I needed a travel visa in order to get into the states, I applied for one and wrote down the number in a word document. Recently when cleaning up my hard-drive, I deleted it accidentally.      So my question is, does anybody know how to get that Application number back?

20090128121329AA51kN6	Travel;United States;Chicago	Need some advice about living in the Chicago area.?	Hi.  I hope somebody out there can help me.  There is a possibility that we will be moving to the Chicago area.  We should find out next week.  The company is in Homewood.  I've been doing my research and seems that this area is kinda ghetto?  So here is my question:  If you worked in Homewood where would you live.  Our budget for rent will be $2,000 a month also take into consideration that I have an 8 year old who needs to go to a good school (possibly a private Catholic) and an 18 year old who will want to go to JR. College.  We are wanting to rent a home not a condo because we want a yard.  Also of course living in a safe area is a must.  We are an Italian/Mexican family so we love diversity, however, our most important factor would be safety and the schools.  We will be moving from Northern California. And yes, I do know the winters are cold so please no negative comments about our  move.  We are moving due to the job situation here in this area.  I would have never imagined Chicago, but actually we are very excited for a change in life style and think we will fit in well.  Any other information would be greatly appreciated, such as info on schools, or rental agencies. The company is flying my husband out next week to "meet" him and have a face to face interview. So I'm sure we'll know in the next week or two if he gets the job.  Also, are there fireflies in this area?  I loved seeing them when I was in the Army, stationed in Alabama.  Would love to have my 8 year old see them.  Thank you so much in advance for the help.

Ammirando i quadri di un museo parigino, pochi giorni fa, mi è capitato di notare diversi ragazzi che osservavano la mia maglietta e si mettevano a ridacchiare in modo sospetto. Alcuni addisittura si avvicinavano leggendo la scritta sulla t-shirt e mi battevano il cinque in modo chiaramente ironico. Sulla maglietta c'era scritto in spagnolo "DONDE ESTA' MI CERVEZA?" (Dov'è la mia birra?). Date le risatine sospette, mi è sorto il dubbio che la frase o una parola particolare se letta in francese possa avere un altro significato o assomigliare a un'altra parola. Qualcuno può risolvere questo mistero? Merci.

20080326225931AAlKkCv	Travel;Africa & Middle East;United Arab Emirates	Do i need an NOC to work in UAE?	HI friends      I worked in the UAE for the past 1.5 years and i cancelled my visa for some personal reasons and now iam in India.I now have 6 months labour ban( still i can go there by visit visa) and 3 months are already over.Iam now planning to go to Dubai by a visit visa to findout a better job.      I heard that if somebody cancelled their resident visa and trying for a new job there, they have to produce NOC from previous employer.Is it true?? I can say that my previous employer wont give an NOC, that is sure.   So how can i get a job there without an noc or is it needed for me because i already came back to india (exited from UAE) and going there by visit visa???

20090225074532AA0hOXz	Travel;Europe (Continental);Belgium	How to travel to Belgium with a 7 month old baby?	My partner and I are travelling for a weeks holiday to Belgium with our 7 month old child. This is our first time of travelling by plane with our baby so would like some advice and tips on flying. I know it is possible to travel by black cabs in UK with just a pushchair, however does anyone know if this is the same in Belgium? I spoke to BMI and they said I can bring the pushchair on as hand luggage but should I bring my car seat too and check that in as hold luggage? I really don't want to be lugging around a car seat in Belgium if I can help it but safety comes first. Also what about baby food? Is it ok to take pre-made formula onto the plane? Cheers.
20090225075045AAbcCQ6	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Where should I move to? I want more job opportunity and healthier living.?	Ok, I guess I'll just say that I'm 25 years old and I was born and raised in Northeastern Pennsylvania. I'm living here currently with my son and fiancee. I want to live somewhere with more job opportunity and healthier living. I would like to live in an area where people care about their environment...where the streets aren't filled with litter. Am I asking for too much? I have looked  into California and Colorado.I am currently in school and I don't plan on leaving this area for the next two years or until I obtain my Bachelor's Degree (which would be in about 4 years) So I'm open to anyone's comments and suggestions. Just don't be mean... I'm kinda clueless and just want to hear what people say. Thanks, have a nice day!

20090225075758AA3Jzno	Travel;Air Travel	What should I do with my Spirit Airlines flight?	Hi, I booked a flight for vacation to BOS from FLL last month for the 25-30th of March on Spirit Airlines -- no flight insurance or anything like that.  I now know that I will have to stay in FL for the 27, 28 and 29th for work.  Obviously, this flight won't work.  The flight cost me $60, and spirit has a cancellation fee of $100... so I would owe them $40 if I cancelled.  What happens if I miss the flight?  Is there anything I can do to get another flight at the same or close to the same price?  Thanks everyone…
