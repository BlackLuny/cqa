The other with us, not a countryman of ours,   Yet from him we garnered the most support.      Adorned in symbols more precious than the prize,   We three acted to open up eyes.   Afterward, we were ostracized and banned,   But worldwide attention was gained, as planned.      We did not invent the salute, but made it infamous   Showing solidarity to a country so heinous   We arrived home, no oceans to cross   And, just like on the stand, wearing only socks      Vilified for not crossing our hearts   We used our own sign to show our support   To our brethren at home, suffering de jure   We promised them, we will endure.      Who are we?

I can't remember if he won or not I think he lost. as I am typing this I think the boyfriend was a dealer at the casino.   The husband I believe lived in a trailer.      Does anyone know this movie?

20090308033154AA71m92	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Can I get a cancer womans point of view?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. she is cancer. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. We went to her place so I can fix her computers I didn't make my moves. I think I respect her brother too much. I live pretty far away for work. When I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her I didn't write back before cos I was busy, and I want to continue where we left off, she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him (he works with her) I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? Is she making it up to see my reaction? It's been two months since. I've fallen and don't know what to do next..

His only son, Clemence, who used to    help him, was in Polsmoor Prison. The old man wrote a letter to his    son and described his predicament.          "Dear Clemence, I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't    be able to plant my potato garden this year. I'm just    getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all    my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me .      Love,    Papa"     A few days later he received a letter from his son.       "Dear Papa, For heaven's sake, Papa, don't dig up that garden, that's    where I Buried the BODIES. Love, Clemence"          At 4 A.M. the next morning, the Scorpion Unit, NIA agents and local    police showed up and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies.    They apologized to the old man and left. That same day the old man    received another letter from his son.          "Dear Papa, Go ahead and plant the potatoes now. That's the best I could    do under the circumstances. Love Clemence."
20090308033840AAj3lCu	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Tin whistle music - Where can I download it?	I have a tin whistle in the key of D, and I need to be able to play something good in about 3 weeks. But I can't find any good (FREE!) music for it.   I'm quite good at playing it, so difficulty shouldn't be too much of a problem here. But working out tunes that are in the right key and are within the tin whistle's range (2 octaves, + a couple of notes, but it goes too squeaky at the higher notes) is proving to be a bit of a problem.         Basically, does anyone know a good site where I can download popular music [preferably not random Irish tunes no one has heard of] for free, that could be played by the tin whistle?      Thanks for any responses :)

20090308034511AAgPLGj	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A hard death row riddle for ya?	You are one of 20 prisoners on death row with the execution date set for tomorrow.      Your king is a ruthless man who likes to toy with his people's miseries. He comes to your cell today and tells you:      “I’m gonna give you prisoners a chance to go free tomorrow. You will all stand in a row (queue) before the executioner and we will put a hat on your head, either a red or a black one. Of course you will not be able to see the color of your own hat; you will only be able to see the prisoners in front of you with their hats on; you will not be allowed to look back or communicate together in any way (talking, touching.....)      (The prisoner in the back will be able to see the 19 prisoners in front of him   The one in front of him will be able to see 18…)      Starting with the last person in the row, the one who can see everybody in front of him, he will be asked a simple question: WHAT IS THE COLOR OF YOUR HAT?      He will be only allowed to answer “BLACK” or “RED”. If he says anything else you will ALL be executed immediately.      If he guesses the right color of the hat on his head he is set free, otherwise he is put to death. And we move on to the one in front of him and ask him the same question and so on…      Well, good luck tomorrow, HA HA HA HA HA HA!”      Now since you all can communicate freely during the night, can you find a way to guarantee the freedom of some prisoners tomorrow? How many?

Is there any truth to this? I have also heard by my family who are Carter's that a lot of Johnny Cash's music was ripped off of the Carter family, whom June Carter would have been a distant cousin of mine. The line goes that June's mom was influenced by black gospel hyms, and their music reflected that, as well as the music of Johnny Cash....because he was basically had not developed his sound well before he met her. Johnny simply took the style and made it famous, in the same lines of Elvis Presley.      Truth or Fiction?

20090308044234AAqGBAY	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What's a good song for a guitarist?	I've been playing for over four years already, and I'm pretty dang good at it, if I say so myself. But the thing is, I have a problem with dynamics and all that stuff. Since I'm in a band, I need to learn how to elaborate my playing. What's a good, flexible song that I can practice on that has a nice series of dynamics? I was thinking something within the genres of rock, powerpop, rock pop, punk rock, or even electro. Stuff that sounds like Coldplay, Tenth Avenue North, Paramore, Boys Like Girls, Nevertheless, Leeland, The Afters, DecembeRadio, Skillet, Flyleaf... that stuff. It can even be a song from the artists that I just mentioned (I don't really check into them except for Paramore and Nevertheless, so I don't know all their songs). If you don't have a song for me, can you at least give me a site or some advice that would better my skills? Answers are appreciated. (:

20090308042952AA09qH2	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I want to win the heart of an Aries man, but i have made a serious mistake! How can i win him for real?! Help!?	There is this man who i really really liked and everything was going well. Ive known him for about 6 months but really only started talking to him in the last month or so. He took me on our first date 2 weeks ago and then a second date and then last friday he invited me over to his house to watch a movie. I know that you are supposed to tease aries men and leave them wanting more and i had played it perfectly up until friday, where we both had a little too much to drink and i ended up sleeping with him. Now i am afraid he has got what he wants and he will go looking for something else! I have spoken to him since briefly by texts and he seems fine but what can i do to really win him? Do i ignore him or start teasing again, or what? I am so confused, and i really do like him! I am a leo girl btw, any advice would be appreciated thanks xx

20090307222510AA2Be40	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Give a star if you like this or think it's funny.....?	A woman is at home when she hears someone knock at the door. She   goes to the door and opens the door to see a man standing there. He asks the lady" Do you have a vagina"?   She slams the door in disgust.      The next morning she hears a knock at the door and it is the same   man and he asks the same question of the woman "Do you have a vagina".She slams the door again.      Later that night when her husband gets home she tells him what   has happened for the last two days. The husband tells the wife in a loving and concerned voice "Honey I am taking tomorrow off to be home just in case this guy shows up again".The next morning they hear a knock at the door and both run for   the door.      The husband says to the wife in a whispered voice "Honey, I'm going   to hide behind the door and listen and if it is the same guy I want you   to answer yes to the question because I want to see where he is   going with it". She nods yes to her husband and opens the door.   Sure enough the same fellow is standing there and asks the   same question.      Do you have a vagina"?........   "Yes" she says......   The man replies.. "Good! Would you mind telling your husband to   leave my wife's alone and start using yours?"

20090308080850AAjO9GE	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why does everyone like jade goody now she has cancer?	Before I go on may I first say i don't wish cancer or death upon Jade Goody, i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. No one in my opinion deserves death.      But why does Jade Goody dying mean people have to suddenly like her? Just because she's got cancer does not mean I have to like her, it just means she has got cancer. If someone you didn't like had cancer would you suddenly have to like them?      I know she's using all this publicity for her sons but I still don't like her selling out her death to the press. She's shown be very ignorant, racist, idiotic and undeserving of any fame she's got. Just because she has cancer doesn't mean I should forget all that.      There's many people dying on the NHS at her age of cancer and they don't have fame to get preferential treatment. My mother has breast cancer yet she was put on a waiting list like everyone else. But somehow my love for my mother didn't increase just because she had cancer.      If you liked her before then fair enough and there's nothing wrong for being sympathetic for her dying as anyone dying is a sad thing.

20090307224807AATxrry	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: Are you going to be sending a tea bag to DC?	if you don't know what I'm talking about just look up New American Tea Party.      Think this protest will help?      here is the chain e-mail i got:   There's a storm a-brewin'.  What happens when good, responsible people keep quiet? Washington has forgotten they work for us. We don't work for them.  Throwing good money after bad is NOT the answer.  I am sick of the midnight, closed door sessions to come up with a plan.  I am sick of Congress raking CEO's over the coals while they, themselves, have defaulted on their taxes.  I am sick of the bailed out companies having lavish vacations and retreats on my dollar.  I am sick of being told it is MY responsibility to rescue people that, knowingly, bought more house than they could afford.  I am sick of being made to feel it is my patriotic duty to pay MORE taxes.  I, like all of you, am a responsible citizen.  I pay my taxes.  I live on a budget and I don't ask someone else to carry the burden for poor decisions I may make.  I have emailed my congressmen and senators asking them to NOT vote for the stimulus package as it was written without reading it first.  No one listened. They voted for it, pork and all.       Okay, folks, here it is.  You may think you are just one voice and what you think won't make a difference.  Well, yes, it will and YES, WE CAN!!   If you are disgusted and angry with the way Washington is handling our taxes ~  If you are fearful of the fallout from the reckless spending of BILLIONS to bailout and "stimulate" without accountability and responsibility, then we need to become ONE, LOUD VOICE THAT CAN BE HEARD FROM EVERY CITY, TOWN, SUBURB AND HOME IN AMERICA.   There is a growing protest to demand that Congress, the President and his cabinet.   LISTEN to us, the American Citizens.  What is being done in Washington is NOT the way to handle the economic free fall.      So, here's the plan.  On April 1, 2009, all Americans are asked to send a TEA BAG to Washington , D.C.   You do not have to enclose a note or any other information unless you so desire.  Just a TEA BAG.   Many cities are organizing protests.  If you simply search, "New American Tea Party", several sites will come up.  If you aren't the 'protester' type, simply make your one voice heard with a TEA BAG.  Your one voice will become a roar when joined with millions of others that feel the same way.  Yes, something needs to be done but the lack of confidence as shown by the steady decline in the stock market speaks volumes.      This was not my idea.  I visited the sites of the 'New American Tea Party' and an online survey showed over 90% of thousands said they would send the tea bag on April 1.  Why April 1?  We want them to reach Washington by April 15.   Will you do it?  I will.           Send it to:   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington , D.C. 20500

20090308050859AAL2Pvn	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should i call the police? or am i making a big deal over nothing?	YESTERDAY I ASKED THIS QUESTION:I was on my own in a shop with bras in my hand and this group of 5 boys came over to me and went 'my mate thinks you are really fit', i just looked at him and started to laugh. He started to ramble on at me and then went 'so i be you have a boy friend then' I lied and said yes, because i thought that would get rid of him, but it didn't. One of them then asked for my mobile number, i refused to give it to him then asked them to get lost. They didn't go so i walked off. They followed me so i turned round and yelled at them to **** off. Eventually after following me around for about 15 mins they left when my 'boy friend' (thanks ben btw) rang me. But they were still stood staring and smiling at me. What would you have done in this situation. In the end i freaked and left the shop... =[ i'm 13, they looked like 15 or something...         MY QUESTION FOR TODAY   i went back to the shop to buy the stuff i had put down yesterday and they were there. I thought i had managed to sneak past them until one of them smacked my ***, so i turned round and slapped his face. He then called me a horney b**ch and started making growling noises at me. I decided just to ignore them so i went to the check out paid for my stuff, then noticed he was reading the sizes of the stuff i was buying like my eg: my bras. So told them to **** off and leave me alone. I walked out of the shop and noticed they were still following me, i didn't want to leave the mall because i was like freaked out bout the fact there were like 9 boys stalking me. It got to a point when i really had to leave so i went to the loos because i knew they couldn't follow me in there. I hoped they would be gone when i got out: they weren't then told them if they didn't **** off now i would phone the police, one of them replied 'okay sexy, calm down, we will go, but don't worry we will definitely be seeing you again'!!!!!!!!  Now i am like uba freaked out, what the hell should i do!?

20090307225059AAgZSw8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How would you talk to your crush?	Okay, maybe he's not exactly perfect--but I do like bad boys. He's a druggie and he got expelled from school last week. I've heard he's kind of nice and he's cheating on his girlfriends. Also, he doesn't like it when people don't like him--so he just talks to them to make them like him or just leaves them alone.      He's very, very handsome and I can't get over that fact. We've seen each other many times though. At first I was bumping into him on purpose but then I stopped. However, it continued. When I was going home I saw him near my house at the bus stop.       I hope he doesn't think I'm a stalker, though.    How do I talk to him?   what would you do?   We've never said a word to each other.      If he's "such a bad guy" how do I get over him? I think about him a lot and because of him, I'm motivated to go to school so I can see him after school. x)

20090308054852AAzR1Xv	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Hi i need to know da steps to make it in the music business?	Ok first I LOVE MUSIC i like all styles hip-hop, rap, rock, hard rock, techno, romance, country etc I like it all. At every minute of everyday there is a song playing in my head. I am constantly thinking of lyrics. Unfortunately I do not have alot of money its hard the way the economy is these days to sit and go pay $50-to-$100 pre hour for recording studio time. It is also hard to sit there and buy the beats off line considering the fact that i would need thousands to get beats to all the songs i want and to mix them up and get $400 programs to mix them effects etc. I am a white 16 year old male trying to become a rap/hip-hop artist i have loved that style and been a fan of it seance I was a young kid. In 1 of my favorite songs from eminem the 8 mile track. Loose Yourself. It states "loose ya self in da music the moment you own it you better never let it go you only get 1 shot do not miss ya chance to blow this opportunity only come once in a life time" that one course has been what keeps me inspired to not want to give up.

20090308003612AAQP7nJ	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	I'm looking for an animation short with a squirrel.?	It started off with it being old fashioned flip book sort of animation.  As the short progressed the animation became more detailed and eventually colored in.  The protagonist was a male squirrel, and there weren't any words, but only music.      I'm not sure where this short came from.  I haven't seen it in five years or so, but it was so awesome, I've been trying to find it ever since.  I think it may be a Japanese short since the person who showed it to my class at the time loved Japanese art, but that's only a guess.      If anyone has any ideas on what this short is, it would be much appreciated.
20090308005134AAUf3kR	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Can someone help me find a stop motion animation?	I don't remember much about it, but I do remember renting it a lot when I was a kid.  For some reason I wouldn't look at the title, go figure.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure it was stop motion or clay animation.  For awhile I thought it was "Bump in the Night," but I was watching that on YouTube, and I found out that was not it, but had a similar style.      The show I am looking for involves toys that interact with each other, and I remember one of the main characters being blue.  He was square, and I think he was a viewfinder or some wind-up toy.  I do not remember much else about it.  I would rent it in the early 90's, but it could have been made earlier than that.

20090308072747AAa2jMp	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does the film "Eraserhead" fit into the horror genre?	I am taking a horror/fantasy film course; and a major part of our grade is a project, which consists of presenting a film of our own choosing to the class.       I immediately thought of doing Argento's "Suspiria", but I recently saw Lynch's "Eraserhead" again for the time in years; and I am suddenly reconsidering that as a possibility.       My only issue is about its placement in the genre; since it's not exactly a conventional horror movie. Therefore, I was wondering if anybody had feedback, as to whether they agree with me that it contains enough horrofic elements to fit in as a surrealist horror?       I am also open to any other good suggestions, thank you.

20090227140119AAnWH7s	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Re: Guiding Light-- Did director ruin it when he changed the look, music, & production aesthetics of the show?	Sometime within the last year, the whole Guiding Light series took on a very different look and feel.  They changed the opening and the theme song which they then started piping in at all different times during the action of the show whether the scene really needed it or not.  So you get sick of hearing that new theme song which is not that good or well-sung to begin with.      And even beyond the theme song, they began using other atmospheric music to accompany scenes, leading one to believe it was building to some climax or end when it wasn't.  With music going almost constantly, It started to look and sound more like an MTV video than a dramatic soap opera.  The superfluous music was not an enhancement; it became a distraction.      And then they changed their cameras to something lower-grade that made many scenes look more like home video.  To save money, they may have switched tape formats or cameras but you can definitely tell because of the degradation of the show's look which is now in the amateur league by the looks of it.      So what happened?  Do you know?  Did the production company start running out of money so they skimped on production values and improvised however they could?  Or is some new whiz-bang junior genius now running the show straight out of Radio/Television/Film school with their hand-held Sony camera like this was a college assignment project?  I actually feel sorry for the actors and acresses on that show, many of whom are pretty good and a deserve better production base.      TV and Film is my industry so this may pop up on my radar screen faster than that for others.  But if you have followed Guiding Light and have noticed the difference in production values, I'd appreciate hearing you comments.  Love it?  Hate it?  Differences not that noticable to you?        I'm not looking for snide remarks from those who don't watch soaps, hate them, or don't know the genre.  I only occasionally tune in for reference sake but from what I see, someone messed this show up -- big time!  That's just my opinion (and this doesn't even speak to the writing which would be another topic), and you may have a different one.  I'm just looking for feedback and perhaps validation that my eyes and ears aren't off-track on this one.

20090308013209AASP51i	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think and is there anyway i can change it?	My first memory of trying to pursue a woman consisted of me being called ugly and a nerd. Then everyday for that year it was a constant humiliation of people telling the girl I liked her and me getting laughed at because her and her friends calling me ugly. In later years I found out one of those girls liked me but her friendship with the girl that humiliated me was more important. As I got older I became the one that was just a friend. I would meet one talk build a connection only to get told I only like you as a friend. It was the same process for years. In college the only time I talked to women was when I was drunk. Eventally that lead to them recieving a bitter verbal assault from me. My friends constantly fussed at me saying I had anger problems. I left college and started working. I met a female there and started talking to her. she was married and at the time I was only looking for friendship because my only focus was leaving and finding a better job. Eventually I began to develop feelings for her and we had sex. It was my first sexual experience. It took months for me to build up enough courage to declare my feelings for her. She said she felt something for me. eventually she would change that and say she wanted friendship. It happened during a very awkward moment. She stayed on my mind because I had started falling in love with her. I kept trying to pursue her. I bought cards, chocolate, etc. She said she wanted cigarend got another job didanything for her. I left and got another job and things changed. she communicated with me less. it hurt but I found someone else. It didnt work out because my heart was still devoted to this woman and she cheated on me with a married man. Now the woman doesnt even want to be friends with me because she says my feeling will ruin the relationship. I had finally found the desire to be friends when she told me this. I got angered and told her I was tired of her stringing me along and playing with my emotions. It has now left me bitter. People say let go and move on its not that easy because she was representative of most of the relationships I have had with women. It brings back those memories of when I was younger. hell I never went on a date until I was 24. Had sex the first time at 25 because all I ever could be was a friend. YOu know how that feel to see that person that wants to be friends come and talk to you about likeing someone or being on a date with them. I have even had one describe in detail her sexual encounter with a guy. It has destroyed my heart and my perception of this man/ woman thing forever. I can never recover from this

20090308050353AAdLYFR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you dance                   Latin?	Dances from Latin America   Latin dance typically includes dances originating in Latin America and    the Caribbean islands such as cha cha cha, rumba, samba, salsa,    mambo, danza, merengue, tumba, bachata, cumbia, and bolero.    Some dance instructors also include tango and Argentine tango in this    list, although these differ from the rest in their style. In Argentina tango    is not considered folk dance as is the case with dances like    chacarera, gato, escondido and zamba. Typical Bolivian folk dances    are morenada, kullawada, llamerada, caporales and the recently    created tinku. In Colombia one of the typical dances is the cumbia,    not to be mistaken with Argentine cumbia, a popular music genre    influenced by Caribbean reggae and ska.

TODAY I FEEL LIKE A FOOL BECAUSE I THINK I AM A WEAK JUDGE OF CHARACTER & NATURE, BECAUSE OF THIS!      1) I had a whole group of rocking friends during graduation.[{(Now we are away from each other but we have phone contact & also meet occasionally)}] There was a particular female friend who was very dear to me. We were very good friends. Then she started to show her real colours. She dumped us for some guy younger than her. Then she ditched him for some other guy. She proposed someone whom she used to call 'brother'. She called her mother insane in front of others. She took to smoking & drinking. She started to spread our phone numbers to bad guys. She started spreading rumours about us, fought with a guy & a woman & also got beated by them! . (THERE are many things that she did but i cannot mention HERE). Our whole group was hurt by her behaviour. Now she is away from us but she always wants to know about us. She says that she was always right & we were always wrong. Huh! We always used to think for her good. The rest of my friends knew her since 3 years. I knew her since 5 years. I couldn't judge her or see her real self. I feel ashamed of myself & terribly hurt.

Pan's Labyrinth is obviously on a different level, but they're both great and they're kind of alike- children's stories that aren't really children's stories (esp. in the case of Pan's Labyrinth), lots of myth and fairy tale elements, gorgeous music and artsy shots, and just an overall sense of mystery and secrecy.      Does anyone know of other movies like this? I'd rather have a couple that really match than long lists of movies that are just sort of similar :)      Thanks!!!

I fell for him   Kept my crush hidden   Never got it out   All was going alright   I could get by      Here we are a year later   Still not over him   My stupid li’l crush   Turned into first love   Soon my heart broke   He found someone new   I broke down soon   All sad and blue      He could never be mine   I could never shine   Through my own skin   I broke down   Cried every night   He was still in my sight   With his arm around her waist    So I knew it was true      He can never be mine   I’m crying all alone   On this damn floor   Still not over   A boy who came   New to school   Had met his eye   There! Fell for him   Now my story ends

I don’t care      Ch: I have no regrets   Over as I am   I want people to   Take me as I am   If they don’t want to   Then they can leave me   Cuz I ain’t gonna change   Take me, take me   Take me as I am   Only, only as I am      People say I’m never late   Some think I’m not straight   Some hate my hair   Others think I ain’t fair   They say I’m fat   But I disagree on all that   Cuz you know that   I never care      I know what people are   They feel like stars   But no one is so   They shouldn’t diss   Me or anyone else   Everyone has strengths   And some weaknesses   Look at me   I’m never sorry   Neither worry   Cuz I am what I am   Take me or leave me    As I am      Song 2: “LOOK WHERE WE’RE NOW”      How many days it has been   The day I’d first seen   A mere boy of eleven   On April the seven   We bonded quickly over   A few words with each other   Since that day on   Of you I grew more and more fond   Look where we’re now   You almost into manhood   And me into womanhood   We laugh and still fight   But always get it right   Only because of you   People like you are few   I know you too well   Even know when you go through hell   Look where we’re now   I’ve seen thing in you   Things nobody else saw   I see right through you   These things I can undo   I’ve seen you stay cool   Even in bad times at school   Look where we’re now   Realize things before it’s too late   You can decide your fate   Can be my best friend forever   Or we can get together   Either way, I wish the best for you   I’ve always loved you

Why was he stalking and terrorizing them?" - - - I think that the person who answered that question best was the terrific Roger Ebert in his Review of the movie.      I felt the same way after seeing the film.  His review is on his website at:    http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs...

Hotline to Hell.   Jigoku Shoujo is about a website called 'The Hotline to Hell', which opens at exactly 0:00, or midnight. There, you may type in the name of the person you hate, and Hell Girl or Jigoku Shoujo will appear and "exact your revenge". Of course, when you pull the string, two graves are dug. One, immediately, for the victim or target, and the second for you. When you die, in return for the Hell Girl's work, your soul will fall into Hell as well.      R u freaked out? I'm looking beside me and stuff....it would be awkward if Hell Girl came in here with me wearing a towel. Lol.

20090308012057AABIjBs	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Expensive item wasn't posted! What should I do?	I bought a quite expensive item (handmade collector's doll) on eBay for a friend of mine for around ￡200!!! I live in the UK and it was being shipped from the US.      I sent the payment on wednesday, and the person told me she would post the item the next day. It's now sunday...      The tracking number off paypal's order details still states that the label has been printed, but the parcel hasn't been given to the post office.      I sent a message and there was no reply, even though she has uploaded new auctions since I sent it.      Furthermore, she hasn't had a feedback since mid-february, despite having sold 2 - 3 dolls a week since then. Should I be worried? What can I do?

20090308070056AA2FgLH	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What are the bases of a good movie and how do critics see it?	I want to be a good movie critic. I love movies and for me they're not just a form of entertainment but a work of art.      However, I often can't appreciate a good movie. For example, No Country For Old Men won an Oscar Best Picture but I don't see why did it win. I don't appreciate it while critics in Yahoo! Movies gave it an A rating but the users gave it only B. It seems that most users don't fully appreciate the movie and are viewing the film vastly different from the critics' style.      Please tell me how to watch a movie correctly. What are the things I need to look for when viewing a film?      P.S.   I know the Coen Bros.somewhat believe that they can't please everybody. I just don't know why the critics gave an A in Y!movies and bunch of 100 in metacritic while users gave a lower rating.

20090308064406AAIBLIF	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What is the best album from an artist who went solo?	As in they used to play in a band (or still do) and did a little side project that's just them (Or rather, has their name as the artist). I ask this because there are very few solo careers that are... well... good. At all. Oh and no people who were solo and then went into a band (No Buckethead!).      Anyway I'd have to choose David Gilmour's "On an Island," I dig every song on that album.      MQ: Which artist would you like to hear a "solo" album from?   BQ: Chocolate milk or chocolate pudding?   MQ2: If you could combine two genres of music, just to see what it would be like, what would they be?

20090308080339AASOrYF	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Is fate/stay night bloody?	I am wondering if the anime of Fate/Stay night is gory or bloody.  I faint very easily at the site of blood, organs, etc, and I am usually pretty bad with bloody movies, etc.  Normally, i wouldn't be afraid, except for the fact that the anime Princess Mononoke was so well made, that I had to stop watching it half way through since the blood was drawn so good . . .   I was wondering if i should stay away from this anime, since it looks like its about warriors and things   I want to watch it so badly, but i have to know how bloody it is first!  any input is greatly appreciated!
20090308082814AAliQ6o	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Tell me about Fruits Basket!?	Well, I am a HUGE fan of almost any manga, and I've been wanting to give fruits basket a try!   I will probably buy the anime, which I know is only 26 episodes, and completed, so that's not my main concern . . .   my biggest question is how many volumes of the manga are available in english currently, and how many will there be in the US? (once it's completed)   I also want to know if you think that the english publisher will be releasing a full series box-set once the manga is finished, and if i should just wait for that to come out if i end up liking the first few volumes, since i ALWAYS love having the entire set of any manga or anime.     Anything that you think would be useful to me for the anime or manga is truly appreciated!   Thanks in advance!

20090308071559AAFQM7F	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Your comments on the following joke...?	A local United Way office realized that the organization had never received a donation from the town's most successful lawyer. The person in charge of contributions called him to persuade him to contribute.   "Our research shows that out of a yearly income of at least $500,000, you give not a penny to charity. Wouldn't you like to give back to the community in some way?"   The lawyer mulled this over for a moment and replied, "First, did your research also show that my mother is dying after a long illness, and has medical bills that are several times her annual income?"   Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbled, "Um ... no."   The lawyer interrupts, "or that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair?"   The stricken United Way rep began to stammer out an apology, but was interrupted again.   "or that my sister's husband died in a traffic accident," the lawyer's voice rising in indignation, "leaving her penniless with three children?!"   The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, said simply, "I had no idea..."   On a roll, the lawyer cut him off once again, "So if I don't give any money to them, why should I give any to you?"
20090308080103AA9CZ3T	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Read this joke...some might find it very rude but its still pretty funny :)?	A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks."    The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language."    Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today."    As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the ***** in the kitchen."

My question is, does this sound like a good idea? The other Bachelor choices are, elem. Ed, sociology, exceptional ed, and a lot of science eduction degrees.
