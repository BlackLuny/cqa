20090429191538AAu74xC	Social Science;Psychology	How do I get out of a down mood?	How do I get out of a down mood? What triggered it was the actions of my best friend yesterday. He talked down to me like I was a little kid and he was the controlling dad. This happens every so often, and I've accepted the fact that it is going to happen.      My problem is getting out of the down mood that can last for days afterwards. The last time this happened, it took almost a week to get back to normal. The fact that he didn't do it intentionally and that he is a good-natured man doesn't make me feel any better. I have always been very sensitive my entire life and have taken people's moments of as*holeishness very personally. I just don't know how to get out of it.

We are both college students. We plan our schedule around each other. We intern together because we are both into government. He wants to be a secret service and agent and I want to be a lawyers.  He was great. He put me first. All his family loved me. Lately I felt like he has been getting distant. I told him that. I got so attach to him . I imagine if we ever break up. It would be on good terms and he will always be in my life. He break up with me because he see me more as a friend now because he is starting to have feelings for some girl who is in his class? I am an A student and that’s all I had before him. I had 2 scholarship interview last night and I did not get any of them. I will not be able to go to school if I don’t get any scholarship  feel like it is the end of my world. I really thought he was the guy that I would marry! We talked about marriage. HE told me how is uncle and grampa separated out of college 3 times by transferring to different states, and they ended up together anyway. He think they were meant to be. He’s been telling me that story for a week but never get it.  He hurts me a part of me wants to be friend with him as he offered ( but I feel it’s temporary until he ask this girl out) .   Ps: I am 20, he is 19. The girl texted him once while I was with him asking him to go shopping. I made no big deal. I was his first girlfriend and he was my first boyfriend. He has been so encouraging about future goals. I never met someone carrer minded like myself that much. How can I let it go.     How can I ask God for help when I actually ditched church last Sunday because he wanted to hang out.

20090306172647AASh8kl	Social Science;Economics	If govt prints money to pay its own debts why would it cause inflation?	I understand that if the govt prints money and sends it out to people (consumers/citizens) in  various forms (tax rebates etc), the value of the dollar will drop, because everyone will then have more money to spend.  However, the govt is just paying itself off when it pays its own debts, so why would that affect the free market that is not a part of govt?  In fact, why would govt even need to pay itself?  Why can't everyone just keep their income and the govt just print money to pay for the cost of running govt? I am finding this very hard to explain.

Are UFO witnesses insane, for instance?  Society would assume this to be true since society has concluded there is no such thing as a UFO, so the only conclusion would be an error in perception on the part of the witness.  If you are happy all the time ignoring the pain of others and living in your own deluded vision of reality are you sane?  Society would tell you were sane since if you are happy you are well adjusted.  So is it reality or society that determines a person's sanity?

It started in 7th grade (I'm in 9th now) when my best friend at the time started to call me fat every single day and I'm put down by other constantly. I never had a problem with myself before then, but ever since I've been repulsed by my body and my looks and just everything about myself. I've been trying to improve, but no matter what I can't lose weight, I can't improve my appearance, no matter what I try. I don't think of myself as ugly or fat, but other (especially "friends") always find something to make fun of me for.      How do I, for once, feel good about myself?

20090306223936AAp1yc3	Social Science;Psychology	Does this relationship have an underlying affinity that goes beyond the bounds of casual friendship?	I met my best friend over an MMORPG. He and I have had a very close friendship for two years now. There is next to nothing that he does not know about me, and is potentially the only person that I can tell anything to -- the same goes for him towards myself. If we ever make huge decisions, we present it before the other person first before finalizing it, and he plays an important role in my life. I flew down to the city that he lives in to visit him six months ago, and the time spent there was purely platonic. However, we have said that either of us would consent to engaging in sexual activity were we both available. In addition to that, we jokingly talk about moving in together. We greet each other the first thing after seeing one another in the immediate vicinity, and tell each other "I love you.. as a friend." on a regular basis. This seems quite obviously more than just a platonic friendship, but what should I do about it? I don't know if I should tell him how I feel, or keep silent - due to both of us having significant others at this point. Any advice on the matter?

20090226222016AARfbFj	Social Science;Psychology	Cheer me up somehow please...?	I cry all the time now. I'm cring now. My dad has been gone for almost 10 months now. I miss him terribly. But he just left. The night after my brothers birthday. That was last May. He's left before, but never this long. When he left I thought he would leave for just one night to go dance at a club and come back the next day. He didn't. But he's done that before too. So I though maybe the next day. He didnt come. He's done that too. So I waited another day. I was beginning to worry why he wasn't coming home. Days and days went by and I'm saying to myself that he's left. He's gone. I cried a lot. November came and I expected him to call me and wish me a happy bday like the last time he left for 7 months. He didn't. He didn't wish me a happy 14th bday for the 1st time in my life. I cried some more. Christmas came and no sign of him. Around late Jan. or early Feb. he called me mom. He left a message saying something I couldn't put together since it sounded muffled. But his last words said "...so goodbye. Goodbye Forever."   My parents have been divorced since I was 5 but I never cared.   It was as if I was born knowing they were divorced.   Back in October or somtime before that I found out he had another baby in Mexico. He never told me. He denied it when I asked him. But i knew it was true. I think he got 2 women pregnant. Now he's forgotten about me and my brother. I miss taking walks with him, I miss watching movies together, I miss watching him play video games, I miss watching him draw, I miss him hugging me. I miss going on vacations with him. I miss his humour. I miss him playing with my dog.   (more tears. My throat hurts now.)   He's dead to me now. He doesn't exist. I am going to grow up without my dad.   When I was 5 I used to sing songs about missing my dad. I used to cry for him then. When I found out he would be moving in with us on my 7th bday I was happier than ever. I can finally be with my dad. He took away my happiness. Everything reminds me of him.   Cheer me up please.         I'm sorry this is so long. You can  SKIM THROUGH IT.

20090307001848AAHiPJo	Social Science;Psychology	Missing childhood-- is it the overpowering force of disillusionment or does life simply never get better?	I know that most adults gush on and on about the simple joys of their childhood and adolescence. I frankly can't see why.       When I reminisce upon when I was maybe 8 or 9 what I remember an "okay" life. I mean yeah, I played with friends, went on some cool vacations, but it didn't really mean much. I was reasonably content, I supposed, I never had responsibilities, but I never really felt ecstatic about it all. That's what happened in reality.      Now when I look back on that I feel an urge to believe that it was better than it was. I think it's because junior year is presenting me with more obstacles than I'm accustomed to and I want to console myself into believing that life has the potential to be as happy as it is portrayed in books and television.      My background:  Don't get me wrong, i'm extremely thankful that nothing truly horrible ever happened to me. I've never had to cope with losing a loved one, living with a serious illness (heck, I don't even have allergies!), going through a traumatic incident,... I'm a pretty good student, have a few passions, a lot I would like to change to help the world. Perhaps the worst thing about my life is that I'm a bit shy, but that's my own fault if anyone's and that's not a horrible issue.       Am I on to something with my theory? Or is it just the way I perceive things?      Thanks for your time and opinion.

Like serial killers they can't help themselves of feeling pleasure on hurting and abusing people and like serial killers, they also commit crimes in series. There is not cure for pedophile, rapist and serial killers. I think they should open their brain and study, maybe it can lead to some form of cure.

20090307010553AAxKL2D	Social Science;Psychology	Dreams after my sister's death?	My sister shot herself in the head February 16th of this year.  After the funeral, I started having dreams about her every night.  We were very close and all the dreams are different.  Sometimes we're kids and everything is like it used to be.  One dream I had was just the two of us talking, and then she stuck the gun in her mouth and shot herself in front of me.  Another one was of her ghost, giving me her approval of the way I was raising her daughter.  We don't have custody of her daughter yet and we won't for another year.  Most of these dreams aren't nightmares but it's really messing me up.  I see her in my dreams and then I wake up and I have to remind myself that she's gone.  I don't want to start every day with that constant reminder.  I'm afraid to go to sleep and often stay up late to avoid it.  My husband says I'm blessed to be able to see her again when I dream but it's just too painful when I wake up.  It's like I have to say goodbye to her every morning.  What do I do?  Is there anything I can do?

It's so nice and when I wake up i find myself missing these made up characters for a split second until i realize they were only figments of my imagination.

20090306230515AAZYE7J	Social Science;Sociology	Ladies, what are your honest thoughts on p*nis size?	Okay, it's pretty aparent that size does, to at least some extent, matter.  Any guy who would argue obviously is either insecure about his own size or has been told by women that he was "fine" or "okay" and so he interpreted that as meaning "size doesn't matter".        So, how would you rate size on your list of "important sexual stuff"?  Is it number one, is it somewhere in the middle, is it pretty low on the list?  What?      I think alot of guys are wanting to know this and some are afraid to ask.  I say, let the truth come out!  So to speak... ;-)      What are your initial reactions to small, average, and large p*nis sizes?  Do you expect smaller men to be less good and larger men to be better?  Do you not judge at all, waiting to see how he "uses it"?  What runs through your mind when you first see a guy for the first time?      I know there are alot of quesiton marks here, but there are alot of questions I feel should be addressed.  So ladies, please state your HONEST thoughts/beliefs/opinons on p*nis size.  Also, girth seems to feel better than length, so is that more important?  Are they equally important?  Please share as much as possible.        I'm putting this in many different categories because there doesn't seem to be a "best" category for this Q.....      Thank you :D

20090307135253AABOqmC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why don't we expect batterers to leave? Why are the battered victims suppose to go?	From the article: 20 Reasons Why She Stays: A Guide for Those Who Want to Help Battered Women; by Susan G. S. McGee    http://www.ncdsv.org/images/20ReasonsWhy...       According to McGee, This article really should be entitled “Why Some Battered Women Sometimes Stay for Varying Periods of Time”.      McGee asks:"Why do women stay?" She says: "This is the wrong question.       Further: "The questions we should be asking are:    -Why do assailants terrorize and torture their partners?    -Why is it that the vast majority of batterers are men and the vast majority of survivors are women?   -Why does the community allow battering to continue?"      McGee points out: "We routinely scrutinize and evaluate the survivor. What is she doing wrong? How can she change? What should she be doing? By doing so, we avoid looking at the behavior and intentions of the perpetrator of the violence. This error rests on the assumption that if we could change the survivor or force her to leave, the battering would   end. This allows the assailant to continue his terrorism unchallenged, since the focus is not on what he is doing but what his partner is or isn’t doing."       Also: "Since violence and abuse in an intimate relationship is under the sole control of the assailant, by constant microscopic examination of the survivor, we miss how we can reduce or stop the violence. By our misplaced focus on survivor behavior, we also miss the ways our culture condones, supports and gives permission for battering"      So why don't we expect batterers to leave? What are the battered victims suppose to leave?       btw: Look at the question-it doesn't refer to either gender as the batterer or victim. If you think all men or mostly men are battered, then you can still answer the question...otherwise, if you want to talk about how oppressed men are by women, ask your own question about battering.

20090307112111AAb2UQu	Social Science;Other - Social Science	I once watched a film on the BBC2 about eugenics carried out in Sweden until 1975. Anyone know the name of it?	The legal assault against people of "bad heredity" began in the United States with compulsory sterilization bills. The first of these was introduced into the Michigan legislature in 1897, but was defeated. A second bill, aimed at "idiots and imbecile children," passed the Pennsylvania legislature in 1905, but was vetoed by the governor. Indiana was the first state to actually enact a compulsory sterilization law in 1907 and it was followed by some 30 others. California did not repeal its law until 1979 and, in 1985, around 20 states still had laws on their books that permitted the involuntary sterilization of "mentally retarded" persons. The United States was by no means alone. In that liberal paragon Sweden, compulsory sterilizations of "unfit" persons were performed into the 1970s. All these laws were meant to improve the genetic make-up of the population, and especially of poor people, by preventing those judged to be "defective" from passing on their "defects" to future generations.

20090307121302AACfdoG	Social Science;Economics	Why do people assume that countries have to loan the US money?	Here is my opinion on the matter after much research and learning about the situation, please read it before answering the question:      The US is the consumer of the global economy, in other words we are in the back not the driving force of this global economy, and unfortunately, we don't produce and manufacture much anymore. Other countries produce much more then the US, especially in Asia and those products are used to stock our stores in the US.      The US borrows a great deal of money from countries through the sale of Treasury Bonds and with that money consumes products from the same countries that it borrowed money from.      There is no real way to pay back those countries for the loans other then by printing money since that money never went to creating anything to export.      How does it continue to benefit the rest of the world to keep this pattern going?      BTW: I am pleased it is continuing for now because if it stopped it would be disastrous for tens of millions of people in the US and since I live in the US, I wouldn't like the consequences of what would happen, but, I don't believe it is sustainable and eventually this system will come to an end and the problems will be that much worse especially due to the amount of new money being put into the system to solve the problems and the inflation that it will create.

I am 18 and I often wonder about the unknown alot (religion, creation, life beyond, mysteries of the natural world, etc.). Instead of like others at my high school who are down to earth and can only see what's in front of them. I don't concern myself with what others my age these days think about (ie. Ipods, games, latest trends, blah!)      I don't know I always think abstractly.
20090307141556AAHwRKH	Social Science;Economics	Do prices change randomly?	I highly doubt that.    In my own studies with various neural networks and genetic algorythms - they were all able to predict the values within different market time, different time frame and to different instruments.    Aside from that, there is a serious logic behind even simpler technical analysis instruments( stochastic oscillator, Williams %R, etc.).       So, I regret to say that....but Bachellier, Scholes, Black and many others were wrong.       Happy trading though.

20090307132328AAScYJg	Social Science;Sociology	How do i avoid these type of people?	I am 14 i am a girl. I live in PA. So far, my school is good, no drama ever since last year. Except for my bf's cousin (girl) hating me because she said im ugly, but my bf said im pretty. Anyways, at the first 6 months of school were good and my bus stop too. Now i have someone stalking me all the time afterschool. There is a boy who is annoying  and he knows where i live, he has my cell # and idk how the hell he got it. He knows my mailbox. Yes i told him, but not my #. I would'nt realize he was stalking me until friday when i was slowly running away from him and he ran after me. I just wanted to push him and tell him to get a life. But i couldn't, and i wish i did. So, at the bus he kept texting me, but i didn't know it was him and when i texted back and said "WHO'S THIS?". he said i am a d-head and to call him. And i heard giggling at the back of my seat and it was him laughing and he was like "I GOT YOUR #!" It was so childish of him to say that and text me because i am not interested. Then that was when i made a run for it until he catched up to me. So, he texted me the day after and asked me if i liked him becuase another girl from our bus stop said i do, i texted the stalker back and said "IDK WHERE SHE GOT THAT FROM..NO I DONT LIKE YOU." he was like ok are you sure.And i texted back and put."YES IM SURE, WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT, SO STOP BECAUSE I HAVE A BF."He is sooo annoying i wish i never met him. He is so irritating like a bug that never gets off you!!.WHAT DO I DO?..please i need help

20090307144317AAFb2jd	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What is anti-feminism motivated by today?	Third wave feminism is very different from second wave feminism, yet many anti-feminists talk like feminism is still exactly the way it was in the 1960's. They still quote obscure feminists from the 1960's or 1970's. Are anti-feminists motivated for equality, or against the past feminists, or really have a score to settle with women or something else?      Here's a contrast of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd wave feminism, maybe a few ppl need to read this so they realize what feminism is today, not 40 years ago:  http://civilliberty.about.com/od/genders...     http://www.bookrags.com/wiki/Third-wave_...

20090307144654AAFTLrU	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	The focused attraction?	When single, men and women, who are looking, try to be attractive to all. They don't know yet who "the one" is for them. So its like an open mind and it shows from the body language.       But in a relationship, committed or legal, do you think that desire to be attractive to all goes away? If your beau tells you that they like you however you look, would you stop spending so much time and effort after looking attractive?   If you try looking attractive, who is it for?
