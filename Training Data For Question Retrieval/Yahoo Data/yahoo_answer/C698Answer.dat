b9pyg0lraa	As a matter of fact, yes we can. But honestly, some don't. I guess i really depends on the person, if she wants to be very committed to the relationship. And if they don't, then of course we all know the answer. Hope that answrs your question.|`|TOSeJQJnaa	The fact is, that due to our nature, no one is able to give our hearts 100% to anyone else.  We all spend our entire lives trying to satisfy only ourselves.  It is impossible to love someone else completely because the focus is always on getting our own needs met.  Think about it:  when we think we are giving ourselves totally to another person, we are looking for ways in which that person is going to return the same level of satisfaction back to us.<br>  <br>  There is hope however that we can find a way to love those outside of us completely and totally and I have included some more information in the following links.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes|`|IT77K1gfaa	I don't think it is healthy to give 100% of your heart to anyone other than God. I love my husband unconditionally and it takes effort, an effort that is worth the work. <br>  <br>  I think that too many people rely on the feeling of love. Love isn't a feeling it is an action. If a woman has feelings but doesn't back them up with actions they are null and void.|`|NctuEmFKaa	Some yes, some have been hurt and it takes alot to get that back.  After a woman has been hurt, she tends to guard her heart and not let the walls down all the way.  If you Truly love her give her time.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Don't understand the payback comment. But anyways, YES women are capable of giving 100% if not more to a man....but only a man who proves himself worthy and do the same in turn.|`|a7xuzUPeaa	Well I'm married and my husband has my whole heart. I would do anything for him! I couldn't ask for a better man. I guess it depends on the woman and what she is willing to do for the man she married.|`|lyWSufFBaa	I can only speak for myself.  No, I can not give 100% of my heart. I can give him all my love but not necessarily my whole heart.  Hard to give someone something that's tainted.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	You tell me Farshad...<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226184830AAFS9c4&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|AA10408380	Yes. I felt I gave that much. which is y it's hurting me even today that he threw my heart and shattered it into a million pieces. Women give more than men. They are trained that way. But then they get with those men, and soon realize that if they don't reserve some, they will get lost in their husband's identity, and have nothing to give to their kids, or to save for themselves. U have to reserve some of ur heart for urself, so then u can more adequadely give it to others as well. Anyone wanting 100% of anything from someone else is selfish.|`|lGSv138Paa	I will make it short and sweet for ya, yes!!!!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I have given my boyfriend 100% of my heart, body, and soul.|`|YzObEmUqaa	Some do <br>  Some don't<br>  Some would live with you but in love with others

Problem is you feel guilty about your weight. But even if you were at an ideal weight, he'd probably still be on your case. <br>  Fact is that others find in you what they don't like in themselves. So he is really telling you more about himself than he is about you. In other words if someone criticizes you for a bump on your nose, he's telling you he couldn't stand a bump on his nose and that's his problem, right?<br>  Bill Cosby wrote a book called "SO." Anytime someone criticizes for something you reply, "SO." and leave it at that. Maybe you can find the book in the library or on Amazon. It's a quick to read book and well worth it. <br>  Now as far as your weight goes, it's probably a good time in your life to re-identify youself and get rid of most of it. You might find the following helpful:<br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>   <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm " rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a><br>  <br>  Additionally I'd recommend reading a book to overcome self consciousness as most teenagers are self conscious. The best book is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz--hopefully your library has a copy of it. Most people read it at least once in their life time and the sooner the better. If any of it seems a bit advanced for you just focus on the parts about self consciousness and being happy. <br>  If all of what I've written makes a lot of sense to you and you'd like to talk to me, get permission from your parents and go to <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/counseling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/counseling.htm</a>|`|1zfwLsQpaa	wow 5'1 and 160<br>  <br>  i am 5'7 and 150 and I get made fun of...<br>  <br>  wow<br>  <br>  Kill him i suppose. <br>  <br>  I know your pain, but not really. wow|`|kdmGZn8taa	omg i feel so bad 4 u. i cant really tell u what 2 do but just think about this: do u really care what he tells u if everyone else says ur really pretty?<br>  <br>  and also try to lose some weight if u can cuz ppl can b really cruel in this world. try signing up for a sport outside of school or something. hope i helped u|`|WnGMzDFaaa	CALL HIM A LITTLE  F.A.GG;O'T  A;S-S  *********!!!!!

FzS3aphWaa	Marriage is about compromise and doing what is best for your relationship.  She sounds like she is too immature or too selfish to understand that sometimes we have to do what is best instead of always doing only what we want to do.  I am sure that you have noticed this attitude in other aspects of your relationship.  <br>  <br>  If you have thoroughly researched your job prospects and the possibility of getting a job where you want after you have the required experience, then it is up to you to make the decision that is best for your future.  She may be happy to have a long distance relationship for a year but you will need to decide if you want to go that route.  Apply for jobs in both locations and, if necessary, fly out for the interview.  If you are given the job in LV, you will need to choose the job and a new life or an inferior job with your old life|`|d1TTwwUUaa	That's hard. I understand your girls objection but you are the man she's going to marry. What if you were transfered. She than would have to go with you. Just keep talking to her. Explain air fare isn't to bad and she can go home for visits and her family is more than welcomed to visit you guys. Sometimes we can't have what we want. Talk to her parents and explain your reasons maybe they can help you convince her the move would be good for your futures.|`|0AShsMsoaa	your fiancee is your fiancee as long as you are in PA.  take it or leave it.  <br>  <br>  me, i would be on the first train to las vegas.  alone.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I went to a wedding in november and the officiant said something really neat. When you make a promise to someone that  you are going to marry them, you are each others everything. You put that person's needs and wants above your own. You are each others family and your individual family needs to understand that your spouse comes first. I loved this and I find it very true. Marriage is about compromise. I will tell you right now, if my fiance needed to go to Timbuktu to fulfill his wishes and to get a job I would do it in a heartbeat. I choose us. When we get married we will be each others family and I am ready for that commitment, I would do anything for him as he would in return. If she cannot sacrifice for you then why are you sacrificing for her. You are sacrificing your hard earned certification and not to mention any money you have spend on getting to that certification/degree.|`|IUYpGvCXaa	I am wondering how old your fiance is??...she sounds a bit young and immature.  Once you are married...you two are each others family & your partner should come first and foremost over parents, siblings, & extended family.  Compromise & supporting your spouse are two major themes in marriage & it makes me wonder what her idea of marriage is?  Plus I have heard that moving away for your first year of marriage is one of the best things you can do.  You are eachothers everything since you don't know many people when you first get there.  Plus no running to mommy & daddy at the first sign of trouble.  You may want to discuss marriage issues more & maybe take a premarital class before you go through with the big day!  Good luck...hope you can find compromise or decided if this marriage is really the right thing to do.|`|yTirNVXyaa	My fiancee and I moved out to Vegas about a year ago, because this is a great place to get started. We left all our friends and family and our relationship has grown and we made new friends. Yeah we get home sick but flights home are cheap and the opportunities for us were worth it.<br>    However I would get a job before you move here the unemployment is one of the highest in the country and they just cut teacher's salary's by 6%. Also people out here don't place emphasis on education because you don't have to high school diploma to support your family. Honestly you couldn't pay me to raise children here.<br>    I would try the midwest before coming out here Iowa, Kansas, and Texas are providing great incentives for new teachers to work there such as tuition repayment, living costs, and so on.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	have you considered HER job prospects in las vegas? would SHE be able to find work out there?|`|PBdPD748aa	i really think your fiancee should really be moving with you. after all, im sure all you are wanted to achieve is to support you and her. and you are marrying this girl which as you know means you will be each others immediate family now and priority.... so she really shouldnt be putting her parents and what not before you, i disagree with that.<br>  <br>  you need to sit down and have a serious discussion. tell her that you are looking to support both of you, which is your family right now. she cant make you keep living badly, not having positive employment opportunities, its for the BOTH of you. speak about it from both of your perspective, yes her parents are important but you need to break free from that for a while, its about you two now! my fiance and i are looking to move as well, far away from everybody, for financial reasons as well.

UBdt4Wm0aa	Not cuddling all night isn't an indicator of incompatibility. Most people like their space when they're sleeping. Now, if you're in separate beds, that could be a sign....and sometimes that's not even a sign but more a case of one being a light sleeper and the other being a heavy snorer and restless/tossing turning type of sleeper like my hubby. LOL We no longer sleep in the same bed because of his sleep issues and because I can't stand wearing earplugs and getting woke up by kicking legs or loud snoring. LOL|`|43CAj5M8aa	This is totally normal sleep behavior. My wife and I do the same. She has a certain way she wants to lay when she is ready to go to sleep. I have a certain way I want to lay.

Besides it gets hot as hell laying too close to each other and you don't want to sweat up the bed unless you're doing somethin else.|`|0wp8tsiPaa	It's sweet to think two people can lie wrapped in each other's arms all night long...very highly unlikely in reality...ha.

We can't stay like that for long...he likes to sleep on his side and I sleep on my back so after a while we give each other a kiss and get into our comfortable positions so we can actually sleep!  I don't think this has anything to do with compatibility...more to do with needing good rest!  Good luck and don't worry!|`|IT77K1gfaa	My husband likes to cuddle but I don't like to be touched when I sleep. I try to give him some cuddle time and then we roll apart and sleep on our own.

00BZohelaa	I am with you in the fact that I can't open up well to people.  Here is one way to help fix this, although I don't know where you work or if this would apply.  If you and a co-worker are next to each other and you see a young girl you could say something like, "That little girl's dress looks just like my daughters".  This in turn will result in your co-worker saying something like, "Oh I didn't know you had a little girl" and then you two will probably have a conversation that just flows naturally.  If you become more comfortable with this co-worker it will get easier with the others.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Brian|`|1TETqLxmaa	ur coworkers dont need to know about ur 3 year old daughter... being open to people does not mean laying out everything about ur life on the table. just try being easy going. dont be too closed off or too open.|`|o5TV8KSLaa	dont worry about it.<br>  its kinda could be a good thing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Asjns8_BkbL5SaKxMODLRE7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226192817AAc5LC9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

6S5Md8Itaa	Abusive people only get worse in my opinion, im not a physchologist but from what i know the first time it happens GET OUT! ASAP! you cant change an abusive person unless they want to change themselves & if they do want to change i would suggest some talk therapy & anger management classes.<br>  <br>  Girls stay with schmucks like that because they think they are in love with them, but what they dont realize is that they are in love with person that they met, not the person they have become. Also every girl wants to be able to change a complete asshole into a better man but most of the time, it doesnt happen.<br>  <br>  If the person your talking about is you, i really wish you the best & i hope you make the right choices.If you have any close family members or friends dont feel embarrissed or scared to open up to them about it because they will only help. I hope this was helpful to you. Take care!|`|X7i59NeIaa	Abusers do not change, they only get worse. Please take a look at this site about abuse<br>  <a href="http://d21c.com/amiani/TarasDedication.html" rel="nofollow">http://d21c.com/amiani/TarasDedication.h...</a><br>  Many women have died because they were afraid to leave, thought they could somehow change the abuser or couldn't escape the abuser. Women stay for many reasons. Money or the lack there of is one reason. The abuser often isolates the victim so that she is cut off from friends and family. He is always sorry and apologetic afterwards and promises not to do it again. She wants to believe him . I am telling you, do not believe him. He will do it again and next time it will be worse.Please if you are in an abusive relationship run as fast as you can. If you know some one who is in such a relationship try to help them escape. These women and their children need all the help they can get.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	From what I've been able to determine, there is a sort of power that abusers feel over their victim when they abuse them. This has also been reported for females who are abusive. The stereotype is that men are typically the abuser, but evidence suggests that females are more abusive in relationships.<br>  <br>  Whether any of that is true, I can't confirm, but women tend to stay in these relationships in the hope that they will get a positive return on their investment. In short, 'if they just love him enough, he'll change', and the ever so sly sucker shot these guys play, the make up, remorse 'act' that they put on.<br>  <br>  Most abusers are very immature emotionally and feel that they have a right to physically dominate their partner. They have found ways to justify their behaviour and can actually become quite adept at it. She might also stay because of one or two positive characteristics that he has or rather that she believes he has. It's an illusion. And rather than face the disillusion, they stay, equally convincing themselves that he is somehow worth it.<br>  <br>  Once a pattern is established, it is very much like quiting a cocaine habit.|`|AA10408380	I don't know. It's a learned behavior. Ur not born abusive. U can control it. I knew this guy who abused his sisters, and his first wife. But now, through counseling, and loosing his first wife, he's really good to his second wife. But I also know my ex, who abused me like an animal for trivial things. His parents and sister stood by and laughed while he did it. They said if I was a better wife, he wouldn't do such things. But he's a bully, he'd order his parents and sister around. They wouldn't say anything in rebuke to him, and if they did, he'd throw a temper tantrum. He was 28 yrs old at the time. So, I don't know. With the first guy I mentioned, his folks didn't put up with it, they did all sorts of things to try and tame his habit(except counseling), and now, he's learned the hard way, that abuse is the wrong way to attain love and respect.<br>  But my ex, his parents were cool with him abusing me. They were cool with hm advocating abuse. I told them he'd go to jail if he were in the states, and they said, "I guess so." he says all girls should be slapped around for advising their men....women should just be seen n not heard...he'd say. and his mom would tell me that my hubby should be my god. So in that case, I don't think he'd ever change, because that's the mentality of him, and the company he keeps.<br>  <br>  the first guy I mentioned. His wife stayed because she wanted to make him pay. And she did. she had his kid, used the kid as leverage, and cleaned him out nice. And, she was also alone(her folks were in india), and she was frightened too. Me...I did love him. HE was so nice prior to the marriage, I thought that maybe if I was nicer, he'd be the same guy(his mom said this would happen). Plus, indian girls are always encouraged to try n work things out...no matter what. In fact, my folks didn't get me out until they saw the big blue bruise on  my arm...and even then, mom said,"let him say he wants out, if he says he wants in, u say ok." Thereby convincing me it was my fault he abused me. I love u, and I abuse u, she'd say, so y is it so hard to imagine that a man who's just learning to love u(arranged marriage), abused u?" He'll change if I do...and I tried my best, but he just got worse.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Abusers do not change. They live in a world all their own, much of it made up. Some girls like to be abused and have it rough. <br>  <br>  If you are involved with an abuser I suggest that you get out of the relationship, whatever it takes.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|5jMNBO2naa	they can<br>  but usually they have to have a conscious first<br>  something they bury in relationships<br>  abusers are extremely insecure people by default<br>  <br>  the women who stay with them are as insecure, if not more so<br>  they get 100%of their validation from the abusers<br>  hence why they stay|`|dCmSA6r2aa	nope some fall for their abusers and start to think that the way they are treated is how he shows he loves her or it is as good as she deserves|`|TJiGs8S4aa	No, they don't typically change.  They continue to try to control and intimidate.  And if they lose one victim, there are always others to abuse.  The only thing that might change an abuser if he realized that he wanted to change - but that is about as likely as snowballs in San Francisco in July.  Women stay with abusers because abusers choose their victims wisely, and go for the ones with low self esteem.  They can be very charming when they woo and draw their victims in - and they are not always abusive.  They carefully undermine their victim's self esteem, destroy her support network and isolate her so that the only reality that she sees is the twisted reality that is in his mind - so that she almost believes that it was her fault that he got mad.  They give just enough positive support that it makes the victim still feel loved - it is very insidious.|`|2KC467tFaa	I didn't think they did. My abusive ex is married now, so there might be a possibility that they can change. I wouldn't count on it, though. I don't think anyone can change an abusive person. They have to change themselves. Someone might allow them to "see" differently, but in the end, it's always the abusers who have to do the changing. Girls stay with them for many reasons. They might stay due to fear, no place to go, emotional addiction, false hopes, lies, or (a common one is) no self-esteem. Abusers have a way of breaking down their victims' confidence, self-worth, self-esteem, and self-respect. They have a way of brainwashing and replacing true confidence with insults and few compliments (building back the esteem with their power behind it). It takes bravery and strength for victims to stand up for themselves and leave. It may take years for them to restore confidence, independence, and especially trust. It's not an enjoyable experience to go through.|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	They stay with them because they were most likely raised in an abusive household, the people that I met that were raised with abuse all tolerate a certain amount of abusive relationships and end up being victims.  I don't think abusive guys change, I do think that when the girl is gone they may feel guilty, but that doesn't mean that they will stop their abusive behavior, becuase every girl is different, their level of abuse will be different x|`|yOHCXiaMaa	Abusers start with mental and verbal abuse to ingrain their victims.  When they show too much strength they go for the physical.  Beaten down or abused women are so insecure due to this behavior they are afraid to leave or run.  Some truly believe if they leave he will follow and the end result will be more deadly..some times it is.<br>  <br>  These guys are sneaky.  They get you to trust them wholly.  No doubts.  When they slip up they apologize and tell their victims "See what you made me do?"  They can't take responsibility for their actions and they won't.  Let one of these mix with a person like me and the result will end badly.<br>  <br>  You can not change anyone.  Get that through your head.  This person must want to change no matter how embarrassing or challenging it is to them.  It takes years of help from professionals and even then it can flair back.<br>  <br>  If you are in this situation  RUN.... don't look back and take back your life cause it wont get better|`|x9FienLUaa	nope and I have no idea why anyone would stay in a situation like that|`|4zeazkWOaa	only death can change them|`|AA10747411	no they really don't.|`|093adb8ec6136150f94ebe4b7a62899eaa	Abusers usually always abuse. Some can get into therapy and do make a recovery, but for the most part, they stay abusers.  I don't think anyone who is not a professional can help these people. They have anger management issues, and control issues, they need professional help. <br>  As for why women stay? I do not understand it completely myself, however I think these men are so manipulative, and controlling these women are scared for their lives more if they left than if they stay. It is a slow process but little by little these abusive men take everything from their women. They strip them of all self confidence, and keep them from friends and family until they are almost isolated. I am glad I have never had to deal with any of that.|`|IT77K1gfaa	I would like to think that they can change, but it will be a lifetime of practice. almost like a drug addict the urge never goes away. That is how they deal with their emotions and lack of self esteem, but unless they get intense therapy to find the root of their behavior and really want to change there is no chance.<br>  <br>  Some relationships are more intense than others and the abuse is a result of this. They may find themselves with someone that keeps them mellow, but the root of the behavior is still there and there is always the chance of a relapse.|`|GyMYBIUuaa	Abusers 99.9% of the time do not change. They abuse for many reasons: raised in abuse, anger issues, control freaks, etc. <br>  <br>  People stay in abusive situations for the kids sake, financial reasons, he will change, they love them, they will kill themselves, no one will want them, kill the abuser, etc.<br>  <br>  None of them good reasons.<br>  <br>  You should not stay together for the kids sake--they are not stupid and know what is going on and are even being harmed in the environment.<br>  Love? Is this love? or habit. Does love hurt like this? NO! It doesn't.  Most abused people are slowly brainwashed to believe they have no recourse. There is no way out. Hence, I will find you no one will want you, etc. <br>  <br>  Call a domestic violence or battered womens' shelter near you for advice in your area. They also have phone support and you never have to give your name or real name to them. Give your friend the number also. Counseling is the only way out. <br>  <br>  Abuser seek victims with certain characteristics that stand out. <br>  Learn how not to be a victim.<br>  <br>  Remember, when they are good, they are real good. When they are bad, they are real bad. You must be pretty smooth talkers to suck you into their web in the first place.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your friend. <br>  <br>  The most domestic violence occurs during Super Bowl Sunday. Above all holidays.  Interesting fact.
bd3f51d39e25c82dde748f2590cdc143aa	Things like these happen to people, It is obvious that what your friend needs right now is a financial aid, if you can help her with that it is much better than talking or simply just be with her to let her know she has someone to depend on it doesn't need words to tell her or give her advices 'coz sometimes talking about things like that is somewhat frustrating... just tell her everything is going to be ok just trust in God, and cheer her up or take her out.|`|WnGMzDFaaa	JUST BE THE BESTED FRIEND TO HER!!!!!!!!AND GO ON YOUTUBE AND WATCH NEWS REPORTER BLOOPERS!!!!!

C8DOT8Y7aa	Approach the girl you like. Say "hi" or "hey" and ask her a question or give her a compliment. It can be scary, but it's really pretty simple. If starting conversations is not your strong point, read these articles:<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Talk to Strangers <br>  How to Come Up with Good Conversation Topics <br>  Flirt a little! Relax, crack a joke, and break the touch barrier (see How to Touch a Girl). <br>  Gauge her interest. Take notice of eye contact, smiling, laughter, and enthusiasm in her responses. Read her body language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous to touch you yet. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she likes you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. <br>  Pop the question. "Hey, why don't you come to the movies with me this weekend?" (It doesn't have to be the movies - it can be anything you're interested in, and that you think she'll enjoy too.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Another good way to ask is "I heard about this movie, _______. What do you think about it?" If she says she'd like to see it, ask if she'd want to see it with you. If she says "As in a date?", don't be afraid to say yes. If she doesn't say that, just make a time, turn up and treat it like a date and she'll get the drift. <br>  Keep your cool if she says no. Respond gracefully, like "No problem! Maybe another time. I'll see you around, OK?" And go about your business - there are other fish in the sea!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another way to go about doing it is to bail before she has a chance to respond. See How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsAsk her when you two are ALONE. Having others around you will stir pressure on her to say yes or no. <br>  Ask her out directly. Instead of texting, getting other boys to ask her out for you, or beating around the bush, just ask her. Even if you're nervous, this will increase your chances. Most girls will admire your confidence if you are not arrogant about it. <br>  Being relaxed and confident is the difference between a comfortable silence and an unbearable silence. It's natural to have breaks in the conversation. Don't sweat it. <br>  Don't be afraid of rejection! Most girls have big hearts and will not let you down very easily, if at all. Some girls agree to one date just because you asked and they're being nice. Don't take it the wrong way, it simply means she likes you enough to not hurt your feelings but not enough that she's ready for a relationship. <br>  When you do approach the girl, try not to start the conversation by a "Hey, can I talk to you?" or a "Can I ask you something?". Don't ask her out randomly, but these lines are giant hints that you are about to ask her out. This would be awkward. <br>  If she says no, just ask "Oh, OK. Is it fine if we're still friends?"<br>  Source(s):<br>  Be persistent, but not too persistent. If she turns you down gently, then she's politely telling you she's not interested. If she flat out refuses, back away. You don't want any girl to think you're a stalker. <br>  If you have to ask her out through a friend, you will get a "no" by default. Girls do not enjoy hearing, "Hey! I'm asking you out for (Name of guy). He doesn't like you enough to overcome his lack of confidence." They will hear this regardless of how tactful your friend is, unless her friend is a very close friend to both you and herself. <br>  Make sure you don't have bad breath! <br>  The worst thing you can do before asking a girl out is not even having a friendship with her!|`|nLiCiRnSaa	wtf? how do you know she likes you? if she didn't tell you it probably was a joke|`|pLirJP9Taa	You should probably ask her to a movie or something.|`|yLTDUZIDaa	well... how hot is she?|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	OH you RWALLY... need help|`|1zfwLsQpaa	how would u that with an ugly chick|`|e3a4075c6850002f169185ad414d1a75aa	u - "what time do u want me to pick u up?"<br>  her - excuse me??  what r u talking about<br>  u - saturday.  i think we should go have some fun saturday night, like bowling or something (please no movies), so what do u think?<br>  her (giggling) - ummm, r u asking me out?<br>  u - of course!  so what time?<br>  her (still giggling) - umm 7<br>  <br>  show some confidence, but don't be a gerk, if she likes you like u say, than u'll be good.  but go bowling or something, not the movies,  go somewhere where u can have fun and talk, actually get to know eachother.|`|hGIi4mKlaa	Yeh sure<br>  She'll marry you any day!<br>  <br>  Completely agree with all the people who think your mad<br>  <br>  Also i thought you were already married ?<br>  Cause you have a daughter according to this question...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApfvLnD6Gmunwnx.ukeTL8vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226192513AArmnNa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7GQb45wRaa	Ask her casually to the movies, dont ask her to marry you or to have sex that will freak her out.

See what happens. <br>  <br>  (And, there may be someone else "in the wings" that you havent noticed yet!)|`|iJeGjRTTaa	It probably won't work out unless he has admitted his feelings to you--lots of guys flirt with girls that they don't go out with. -coughs-<br>  <br>  He could just be trying to be humorous about the titania thing, but I don't know...|`|rNE7XAmgaa	He seems pretty friends, perhaps you have a crush on him? It looks like you've given this a lot of though, you must like him.|`|gjwP0xfeaa	I think he likes you but don't push it...let is happen naturally for him. He is probably trying to read your signs to see if you like him or not.|`|bCGfqfi1aa	He could like you, or could just be trying to be your friend.|`|7QDYWAkfaa	ok, if he liked you he would ask you out.  If not he won't. move on to someone else.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	friends sorry no future|`|zO59ezH3aa	He, likes u... Alot. just flirt with him or ask him out eventually something will happen|`|Xgx8TjWcaa	He probably likes you, its kind of silly that you are asking people on YA because you yourself said in #4 he flirts with you, why do guys flirt? To show that they like you. Also everything else points to he likes you.<br>  <br>  So if you like him, flirt back, if not I suggest you go find out if this guy is a creep and a stalker|`|3Gg8PDXOaa	well about the play thing im a boy and sometimes i do that to get attention  but if you want my advice ask him over to ur house then ask him if hr like you or not|`|OmyQFP4Laa	i think of what you just said, that he loves you. he is always hanging out with you. so i guess he really loves you. and probably when you get a chance you should ask him|`|kfioQ6GGaa	I think he might like you.  You may have to wait a while or if he asks you out or something but it might take sometime.|`|rpI9PLO6aa	it sounds like he likes you, but he needs to grow a pair of balls first and stop giving these mysterious hint things. its so annoying when guys do that. :P|`|e4ecc6ecde0e449c7b00bc9bd8ce1f8daa	Either/or, Darlin'.  sorry.<br>  <br>  with the flirting...I'd lean toward liking you.|`|BuKdYyMVaa	Yes! ^^|`|kERP7zAhaa	i think he might just being friendly. he seems like he wants to be friends with you.|`|hbtCPs5qaa	yes|`|7AndmAg4aa	i think he might like you a little.|`|K2QwEM4raa	I think he does like you but just doesn't know how to go about showing you.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Yes he likes you, either that or he considers you a really good friend.<br>  <br>  <br>  Might be either one|`|zzHR6uuiaa	Yeah,he likes you! try talking to him more and find out more about him. if you like him then tell him!
oQcDZI9Daa	goodness... he definitely likes you.<br>  next time he says it, be coy.<br>  say something like, "i don't know... did you miss me?"<br>  put the ball in his court and see what he does with it.<br>  good luck.|`|kPl1SJ1Aaa	If you like him, BE YOURSELF, dont be weird and shy.<br>  <br>  Why is he asking you so often? <br>  <br>  Always be sure to say "Do YOU miss ME also?"<br>  <br>  Or, get some groove, girl, and occassionally toss him a "Well, I'm not sure, I'll have to think about it." or a "Not so much today, but check back with me tomorrow."<br>  <br>  Its all about the flirt and staying IN control. Right now, sounds like he has the control and is trying to make sure you are still on the hook.|`|ZWEUdfN8aa	say no just for the fun of it and then say JUST KIDDING, and throw your arms around him.. it will get him thinking for a second and then realize he wants you hah|`|OmyQFP4Laa	yup he likes you, probably you should ask him if he misses you|`|zO59ezH3aa	He likes u. U should ask him out|`|1326cb00e49de27af7fc131cb4f406dfaa	dont let him ask.  just go and give him a big hug.  that is a little easier and not as awkward...<br>  <br>  plus, although its not much more, it could get him thinking about the possiblity of you liking him|`|bkgBLjuvaa	maybe cause he misses you too?|`|FSruw622aa	To say that you miss him you are actually telling him that you like him.  If you say that you dont know, then he could interpret that as being that you have already moved on to a new guy.  He is probably shy, try talking to him about it.|`|7AndmAg4aa	when he says it again be like why do you always ask me that! then like laugh or something haha|`|3kCQDUUGaa	he likes you|`|Vkv0Ba1faa	What a flirt
TJiGs8S4aa	I have a secret - people still won't necessarily like you even if you say yes.  They will just use you - and then toss you away.  You won't gain their respect.  And you don't even respect yourself!  So it is a lose-lose situation.  If you stand up for what you want, at least you will make yourself happy, and you can learn how to say no in a way that is not mean or unpleasant, but is assertive.  <br>  <br>  You are a people-pleaser because you feel insecure.  Maybe you've always had a hard time getting approval from someone important to you, or you've been surrounded by people who avoid conflict at all costs.  Perhaps you've been made to feel responsible for other peoples' feelings.  There are many possible reasons. You'd probably be better off exploring that with a counselor, but there is a reason for it.  When you get to the root of why you feel that way, you can learn to face it.  A little counseling could work wonders for you. Good luck!|`|AgzRyqWTaa	self check alert,whenever you feel within yourself that you want to standup for your self just imagine me asking you what does on says backwards.What i can't hear you,louder my ears got wax,[no]oh cool there you go.|`|N8AJnAbuaa	practice in front of a mirror saying no|`|cMVKfQMhaa	Well it’s good that you want to help others but you have to think: If my friends told me to jump off a cliff, would I do it? Start thinking when you should say no. When you start to say no to people, you begin to feel guilty and you wonder what would have happened if you said yes. That’s natural. Everyone has to feel guilty now and then. But there is some guilt we have to take. If you are afraid of not being “cool,” who cares! Just go your own way. Saying no will hurt. But there are pains that we have to accept. Just try your best to ignore the pain.|`|1TETqLxmaa	say no and see how it turns out~ not everyone will think like u think they do~
2o3BHgCCaa	Roses are one of the most affordable flowers you can buy. Depending on stem length they can range from $4 (30cm stem) to $12 (60cm stem) for a bunch from a wholesale florist. Or about $25 - $50 from a regular florist.<br>  30cm stem is enough for a bouquet and you would need 2-3 bunches.<br>  Then you pay for labour and thats where the expense comes in. DIY to save heaps of money.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Honestly they're cheaper then most flowers. Why? Because they come in bushels where they'll get them in about 12 roses at a time, where some more less known flower would be more expensive in the long run because they only come with 6 buds or less.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Contrary to popular belief, roses are actually rather inexpensive compared to other flowers. The only time you pay outrageous prices for them is Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I was told that roses run about $4 per stem in my area - - and that doesn't incorporate the cost of the labor to make the bouquets or arrangements.<br>  <br>  I was happy with that so I am having some roses in my bouquets, but not in all of them.  I'm also not having floral centerpieces so I can further decrease the costs of my wedding.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	It is depend on the roses you decide to buy but normal rose which has more smell is some times it lower down to 100 pieces for just 2Rs to 3Rs.sometimes the Bangalore Hybrid Roses are costly always,   But you can get all variety of roses at Vellore & Chennai fruit market at a reasonable rate. I can proudly Say In Roya Vellore Near Katpadi Railway Station on thew way to Bangalore fruits or vegetable or flower's you can get fresh and the price will be nominal,|`|wG2AbAXEaa	I had all charlotte red roses in my bouquet and it was $105.

Possibly cheaper in the summer but I don't know. <br>  <br>  I have heard both as well. I didn't think mine was much as I have heard of bouquets costing way more than that but that could be for tropical flowers. <br>  <br>  Call some florists in your area to get an idea of what it will cost. Or try your local wholesale club and preorder them and make your own arrangements.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	The cost of roses depend on the time of year. For Valentine's Day when they are in high demand, they can be $80 a dozen, which my husband has paid. I think that is ridiculous. They will also be very expensive during the wedding season. For some reason, roses=love so the price gets jacked up. Get married during the fall and they are less. I would go with a different but equally beautiful flower. I used pink carnations and pink daisies in my bouquet and it was beautiful and a lot cheaper. Daisies are my favorites. If you have to have roses, you could try silk. A lot of brides use silk flowers and then you can keep them for always. Best wishes.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Gracie if you are somewhat crafty or can follow directions, then this DIY below is the best deal out there. We are DIYing our wedding and have 12 doz roses @$210 in 2 colors but you could get 2 boxes and have 4 shades of pink 2 boxes =8 doz for $140.  We are mixing the roses with Asiatic Lilies/ Daisies/million star.  We have 4 maids also and 3 flower girls, 4 groomsmen and family corsages and such.  Hope this helps you get your dream.|`|cCymTwdcaa	Roses usually cost a few dollars a stem unless they are a special variety. My mister and I were looking into gerberas and found out that they would actually be more expensive than roses. I would recommend checking out the local florists, comparing rates, and do not mention that the flowers are for a wedding. <br>  <br>  I was looking into theflowerexchange.com. Depending on where you live, they seem pretty reasonable.|`|vyL7yEleaa	no matter what if you are going through a florist they are going to be really expensive. my bouquet is running $70 for 12 roses (i want a small one for myself)<br>  <br>  if you do it yourself you can get them for a lot less. i am doing that for my wedding cake and centerpieces. i am looking at whole sale flowers which are a lot less then going through a florist. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ4ZXsyqsWo&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ4ZXsyqs...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fiftyflowers.com/flowers/WeddingFlowers_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fiftyflowers.com/flowers/Wedd...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.growersbox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.growersbox.com/</a><br>  <br>  there are a couple, but just google wholesale flowers and you will find alot|`|D9ufwiMXaa	Roses can be quite expensive, however they are relatively inexpensive compared to other flowers.

My dad got my mom and I each a bouquet and they cost $50 each. You could also buy some cheap ones at like Walmart or Kroger or something. It is the thought that counts, not the price.|`|gnom5J8Naa	Roses are pretty expensive. Flower prices really change due to the time of the year not so much the area. I would guess for a wedding they would be about 3 dollars a piece.

NO one on here can give proper answers to these sorts of things without actually getting to know you and finding out exactly what happened and how you are feeling.  I am really looking forward to talking with you.

Clearly he/she should do something and if she/he doesn't go to the police station and tell them before your father goes to far!!!|`|fwZPEqwMaa	My dad used to beat my mom and I but once she went to work and had a bruise and they questioned him.  He also is a judge so he can't have bad reputation. I think that's the only reason why he stopped.<br>  I still live with him to, and he makes me so miserable and unhappy.  I used to cut and i too stopped. I guess i was sick of being judged. <br>  I've never told anyone about this, but i hope to one day be able to tell someone about it and let it go.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm so sorry to hear that you're stuck with a father that's similar to or even worst than mine; all i can say is remember "this too shall pass" it's really hard to think that when you're down and i always felt suicidal when he hit me but sometime i'd be so glad to still be alive.  There are things in life that will be worth staying alive for.  Hopefully soon you'll be out of the house and can get away; good luck<br>  if your dad is like mine, and tells you that you have no future, or the world is big, and u won't be able to handle it...as you said to me..don't believe it<br>  <br>  <br>  I've never been raped but i can imagine it a horrible experience.  It wasn't you, it was the rapist.

U just have to try really hard to forget about these things. You have to let it go. i know its hard but but u must try even harder. talk to someone like a school counselor. DO NOT KILL YOURSELF! Thats the last thing u want to do. Stop cutting yourself and spend more time with your lovely boyfriend. thats what he's there for.<br>  <br>  Problem 2: I had this same problem (without the beatings) maybe u could report him to the police or HRS. Or u could try getting a job (u and your bf) and try moving out from with ur dad. He could easily gets busted if someone finds out what he does. <br>  <br>  Do whats best for u sweetie. I think my problems and your problems are very hard. We just have to get through this the best way we can.

Maybe see if you can stay at a friends house for a bit or something?|`|7A30yQf4aa	I'm very sorry for what has happened to you in life, I was never raped but I was molested and I know it hurts very bad. My mother was too busy poppin pills and sleepin all day while my dad beat on us and her too. So when I give you this advice take it from someone who knows. I am now 23 years old but since you are under 18 I would suggest speaking with your school counselor and explain everything. Tell about what you do to yourself, what has happended to you, and what your dad has also done. By law they have to report it, then from there let them know you feel you can no longer live there and maybe they can place you in a group home for girls. I know group homes are not the best place but it can get you out of your dysfunctional house hold. Good luck!|`|GyMYBIUuaa	Please, Please seek counseling. Find the number for your nearest battered women's shelter. They also have sexual assault counselors. <br>  As a rape survivor, I know how you feel about yourself and the next situation. You froze and did nothing out of instinct to survive. You are beating yourself up horribly. I wish that you were near me so that if nothing else, we could talk.<br>  <br>  Your father sounds just as bad or worse, he is suppose to love you. It is a long series of battles to win the war with him. That includes calling the police every time something happens. If also means possible foster home or county home. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend sounds very loving and patient. <br>  <br>  I can't stress enough that you need to seek counseling. The number is in your phone book. Call and you don't have to use your real name. If you don't like the first counselor, seek another. There are many on staff at most places. You need someone out of the circle to talk to. <br>  <br>  Cutting and throwing harm you and only you. But, you don't feel worthy so it doesn't matter. I am telling you that YOU are worthy! You just don't know it yet. Do you think your only purpose on earth is to suffer?  Well, it may seem that way, but it is not. God put you here for a purpose. Please, talk to someone professional. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, Sweetie!|`|OL3MUunlaa	Honey, I am not a doctor of a psychologist so I do not want to say anything that will worsen the situation.  This forum is wonderful for seeking advice or for a little entertainment, however you need professional help ASAP.  You have so many issues to deal with.  Nobody here in a few paragraphs can give you the help you need.  Call a rape crisis center to start with and I am sure they can steer you in the right direction.  I hope things work out for you, you deserve better.|`|GM6RGpHJaa	Your story remind me of one of my ex girlfriends(not the one you answered for me :P), except her stories are a bit worse than yours.<br>  <br>  She was raped, by her stepfather, at age of 11, continuously for next five years. Out of depression, she attempted suicide, but failed. She was raped again by a girl(you read it correctly) in high school. She's been a sex toy of her ex boyfriends. She has a blood coagulation on her kidney, and will die in about 5-10 years.<br>  Not to brag, but I was the one who pulled her out of the pit. I gave her the reason to be happy, I let her know that being a victim of rape does not make you a bitsh, instead you need to be embraced.<br>  And hey, although she usually sounds like a terrible emo, the "real her" is very nice and energetic. I really liked that. I was glad to see that I can leave a big mark on someone's life like that. She started to smile, laugh, joke around. <br>  We broke up, but I still watch over her as a best friend. If some other guy mistreat her, I drop everything and go kick his @ss. I'll be one of the people to cry the hardest at her funeral, I'll be one of the people who'll watch her take the last breath. And I'll be one to give my kidney if an operation can save her(humans have two kidney and we can still live with just one :P).<br>  I made a promise to her, that if I ever get rich before she dies, then I'll take care of everything for her. It's not because of the romantic love, not because of the friendship, but probably because of the memories we share.<br>  <br>  I feel you girl, I do. I still remember her talking to me how she was raped and played by people she trusted, with a plain poker face. I felt terror, literally. I shook in anger. And then endless sympathy.<br>  <br>  Stay strong, hold your head high, you're not alone.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Go to the nearest women's crisis center or the Department of Human Services or to the Police or to a school counselor and ask them where to go to get help.

DSMmF2Xuaa	I see no confidence in you. Have confidence dude!!! =D Girls like guys who are confident but not over confident. What kind of dumb jokes do yeh make? Do yeh make jokes like who is smarter? batman or superman? Then your right answer will be like.. Batman is smarter because he covers his face when he's wearing a underwear. (A friend told me that joke. I didn't laugh).If its not that stupid, then its okay. jokes are meant to be funny and a little dumb.  <br>  <br>  Are you the quiet/shy type? Perhaps you should try being open yeh know. If you think you're annoying, then stop being annoying. If yeh wanna disturb ppl or whatever, you must know your limits.Have a postive attitude as well! <br>  <br>  If you wanna approach a girl, just smile or say hi..then slowly by small conversation.. like how're yeh doing and all. Wanna ask her out? Ask her if she wanna hang out sometime? Don't rush. Take time to know each other better first. If you see the connection there, its good! =D<br>  <br>  <br>  Low self esteem.. nah.. that's not good. I used to have low self esteem. Yeh know what? You should try working this one out first. Girls don't like guys with low self esteem. Like I mention earlier, HAVE CONFIDENCE!!!! Think positively!! This is really important dude! If you don't have this, Its gonna be hard for you to approach a girl. Because you'll be like so self concious and all. <br>  <br>  I'm 18 this yr and I've not had boyfriend before as well. yeah! I know how it feels! It sucks!! But hey who knows we'll have someone who will accept us for we are aye? Sometimes this kinda stuff takes alot of time. Don't get too bothered about having a gf. It'll happen eventually. Just work on your low self esteem. Talk to a girl in whatever ways you're confident in. Don't have to say hi if you don't want to. You could just smile.. yeh know a slight smile will do. Things will flow by itself. <br>  Oh! One more thing, forget what happened in the passed. To have a relationship, you have to be prepared to be rejected. Rejection, you can't take too hard. Take it easy and move on. Find someone who'll like and love you more than that. Its just like friendship... if you know someone who doesn't want to be friends with you then move on!! Find another friend who wants to make friend with you. <br>  <br>  All the best to you!|`|EnEulm9uaa	dude just talk to girls.<br>  chat with them and dont worry about sounding stupid casue its better mess up every now and then then never even get around to saying <br>  Hi.|`|1l7bK325aa	no offense buy you r like...screwed for dances and stuff<br>  look at this from my point of view<br>  you dont ask cause youre afraid to get rejected<br>  im guessing u dont even attempt to try<br>  you dont have guts<br>  and you never actually ASKED a couple of girls of what they think of you<br>  you think of yourself as lowlife<br>  you think your jokes are lame and dumb<br>  you have about...no self confidence<br>  <br>  despite these facts, if i know you, i would go out with you<br>  except i dont really dig heavy metal, closest it gets is the band guns and roses :D<br>  and i have a life and i hang around cool and funny ppl|`|gKhR0sgLaa	You fear them.<br>  <br>  You first of all need to be more confident and outgoing. The more friends you have, the better chance you have in fining that special person. Girls love confidence and decent social status. If you are the outcast/loner type that you say you are, then you are almost saying you have no self confidence, because nobody wants to be alone unless they are either depressed, or don't feel good about them self.<br>  <br>  I listen to death metal myself, but I am not a loner. Music has very little to do with how you act around people.<br>  <br>  As said before, just work on that self confidence issue you have, and you'll be find.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	well youa re in 9th grade, and while you may not realize it, you have plenty of time.  Even if you have ruined all chances with every girl in your school...join a club not at school that involves peopel with simlar interestes, or wait till college.<br>  <br>  if there are things that you dont liek about yourself...which it seems that there might be, then make an effort to change them.  <br>  <br>  My personal belief is that...you have to date and you have to get rejected in order to to find the right person.  If you never date, then you will never meet that person or have the chance to.  You will never learn how to act around girls, and you may scare away the girl that you want if you never learn.<br>  <br>  SO...part of dating is rejection.  If you dont like anyone right now, dont sweat it.  You will one day.  And when you do...go ask her out, or ask her to get some coffee or go to the movies.  If she says yes...good job.  If she says no...then say ok, thanks anyway...and sul for a day, and then get back out there on your feet.<br>  <br>  as for the "tall dude with no life comment.  what are your hobbies? do you really not have a life?  Why not pick up a sport or learn something new.  You dont have to do it through school.  <br>  <br>  I was that weird ugly blonde girl with no style, but i joined karate.  There was noone from my school, fashion didnt matter because we all wore the same thing, and you learn no to be as shy...it really pulls you out of your shell because you HAVE to be loud.  On top of that...your exercising and meeting new people.  In all honesty, karate made me waht I am today...but so could an art class or cooking class in your community.  Join a running club or try a 5k road race sponsored by your local YMCA.  there are tonsof people, and hey...you gain a life.<br>  <br>  if you enjoy video games, try finding a club that plays together so you can socialize.  figure out what you like to do or try somethign new...but get out there and be social...i think thats your first step.<br>  <br>  dont use the excuse that you are too shy to get out there...i was one of the most shy peopel in teh world...i still get panic attacks in big crowds...but im as outoing as i can be...<br>  <br>  you can be mroe outoging and creative and experience things while still being your cool quirky self...you dont have to sacrifice your personality to put yourself out there and try new thing...all you will do is add more thigns to it and learn new stuff that you can tak about in your dates...when you do finally get one.<br>  <br>  i hope that helped.  <br>  <br>  good luck!
F9mQm1JEaa	She has something up her sleeve.|`|URjBYtGeaa	Has she been taken pills or <br>  do u have a dad?<br>  if not she has a boyfriend?<br>  Or..... pretty much something new in her life?|`|POFdWpUzaa	Maybe you need to analyze what you might have done to make her this way or what's been happening at home to make her this way. When she is angry, what makes her that way? When you know this, you will have your answer. Also, start spending more time with her, talk to her about little things, get to know what makes her tick. She will love the attention and the fact that you are WANTING to spend time with her. Moms love being with their kids, especially when the kids initiate it!!|`|jUxwbLTtaa	She might ask u 2 do something u don't want 2, but don't fall for it
j76UvzTXaa	It depends the way you are joking around. It is cool that you are being out going with her but because i don't know who you are  i cannot really tell you much but you should either give her some space for her to notice that you aren't following her and she will go to you. Or you should be around her more and don't let anyone get to her before you.<br>  I am in middle school and the way we do it if you like the person ask them out before it is too late GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|QZHMckOhaa	it sounds like she likes you, but she might just be flirtatious. if you think this might be the case, dont be a dick to her, but dont give her all the attention she wants right away because this just lets her know that she can have you whenever she wants. maybe ask her to hang out so that you can get to know her better and become closer friends. if you do this it will make her easier to read and you might be able to get a better idea of whether or not she likes you after that.|`|F1ug1Emzaa	Yeee she prob has a crush on you but if you don't start making moves she might get over you!<br>  Soo start flirtinng with her my dudde!<br>  Oh nd askk the girl if she wants to hang out(:<br>  Or w.e yall do.|`|kdmGZn8taa	YA SHE TOTALLY LIKES U|`|NGf3l9Otaa	She definitely has some feelings for you, most likely subconsciously. I suggest that you just seize the day and ask her out now before anyone else steals your opportunity. If you lack the confidence, you can always rely on one of your friends to be a wing-man for you. <br>  <br>  Remember, you can't EVER afford to be indecisive, because then you will only lose your golden chances. In the story of Hamlet, Hamlet's indecisiveness led to the deaths of just about everyone.|`|xAO51wlRaa	if you like her..ask her to hang out with you. after school is a great start studying together is a nice way to start off as well. just be very persistent|`|ZW1xklaAaa	your just a friend|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	hard to say. notice if she's like that with other guys or just you.<br>  you may have to ask her. just be casual. say "so.. who does (enter her name here) like these days?" or something to that effect.<br>  be flirty when you say it. say "well, I like someone.

RgymoiIQaa	Try and keep the slobber in your mouth and close your mouth a little bit more. Maybe, before going in for the kiss you can swallow what you already have in your mouth before going for it. If you are talking about the other person. Well, you would have to give them these suggestions, or just tell them they give wet kisses.|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	Quite simply, don't use tongue at all (or at least use less of it). I never really was into those peer pressures around high school on using French kissing, I really don't want to feel my gf's tongue so I'm sure she feels the same. The main issue is you need to use a lot of lip action to compensate, but at least, it won't be so slobbery.|`|pLirJP9Taa	Don't shove your tongue down their throat. Keep your mouth fairly closed. If you must use tongue, swallow your spit. Theres nothing more disgusting than having your face all slobbered over when kissing someone.|`|kPl1SJ1Aaa	Swallow. Dont wash the face, just tantalize with the lips. :)|`|aOYkqGOxaa	lickyour lios then swallow|`|cbCLojhSaa	use chap stick and befor u kiss whipe it dry|`|KaUSzl4Maa	ehh suck all ur saliva down dry ur lips keep ur tounge out and ur gonna be just fine
91R1jKifaa	no you don't have to tell him..he has a gf so if/when you are going out with the guy you like..let him find out then..even tho he is your exbf there was a reason why you broke up in the first place|`|FzS3aphWaa	Why would you tell him?  Giving him this information could lead to him telling the guy that you like.  That could lead to an awkward and embarrassing situation for you and the guy you like.  <br>  <br>  Telling anyone about a crush is never a good idea!  This is information that you need to keep private.
pLirJP9Taa	Suicide is never the answer, especially over a relationship. No matter how great your relationship was, its over now and its time to look to the future. Make sure you tell yourself that the relationship with this old guy is over, and that this new guy deserves an equal chance. He should not have to suffer for what your ex did. And don't make it about sex! if you really like this guy, go on a date with him. Hang out with him. Don't worry about sex! If you ever like someone enough to have sex with them, you won't worry about thinking about your ex. And I promise some day you'll have a relationship that is so amazing that you'll look back on this and realize how stupid your ex really was and how glad you are that you stayed around to meet that amazing person. Suicide is never the answer to anything. So hold in there, and thrive off your friends support and give this guy a chance.|`|y5DAfNtHaa	Suicide is the worst thing you'll ever do to yourself... and it is not an answer to all of your problems.. just move on and if you can't help yourself try consulting psychiatrist.. psychiatrist is not only for crazy people they can help you with your personal problems with their counseling..|`|0GjMKJbbaa	Girl...you just have to let go. He "lovED" you. Now it's over. That other guy is probably getting his heart broken. Don't let your ex do you like that just forget him. You can do better. <br>  If you are thinking of suicide you need to talk to someone really. <br>  You can do it<br>  be strong|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	Broken hearts will mend.  But you have to make the choice to move on. Worry about sex when you have a real committed relationship; like with some one you are married to!|`|hyY5t2JKaa	Stop being a fool and start partying and going out with ppl.........|`|0hhfExzLaa	...you should really telll someone about your thoughts in the title of this.|`|EuhWXJgiaa	I am so sorry !|`|x1FzJLwZaa	No please dont do it. I was on the same situation as you are but a little bit different. There was a lot of things going on, my boyfriend and I broke up, mean things were said. I was accused of being fake and crazy and obsessed. It really hurt me. I love him so much, I didn't want to lose him but I didn't give my best to keep him. I wish he could forgive me. It shattered me. I felt alone, unwanted and empty.  It all happened within 12 months. My life went from being happy to a mess.<br>  <br>  I looked at my reflection in the mirror and think, Will I be missed if I die? Do I really have a purpose in this world?<br>  <br>  Every time I go home, I go straight up to my room and cry because I don't understand where this feeling of depression is coming from, and it's overwhelming. I listen to sad songs because I feel better when the pain is directed somewhere else. Every night, before my mom comes home, I wash my face to hide any evidence of tears because I know how hard she works and the last thing she needs is to worry about me. She always say, "if anyone or anything is bothering you, you can talk to me and let me know, anytime."<br>  <br>  It's every time she says these words that I open my mouth and try to tell her about what I'm going through, but I am so convinced that she will never understand it and no one will ever understand me because I don't even understand myself.<br>  <br>  Late one night as I lie in bed, I was staring at the ceiling and think of the many ways to end this misery. I finally come to the conclusion to end my life. I feel obligated to explain why, I decided to leave my mom a suicide note.<br>  <br>  I started with the words "I am sorry", and I continue writing, listing my reasons, my everyday sadness and my lackness of interest in everything. I tell her I love her and it's best for me to do this and that we will meet up in heaven someday. As I begin to fold the letter, I realize what I am about to do. I think about my mom, my dad, josh, my friends and how much pain they will go through. I cry when I see my selfishness, cry some more when I read the letter out loud. Maybe death isn't the road to regaining happiness, because I remember there was a time in my life when I was happy. I wipe away my tears and head to my parents room. I told them everything. They cried and hug me, and i feel relieved.<br>  <br>  After that night, we sought help together, and I met a lot of kids the same situation I'm in. My mom stuck by me and encouraged me. She took the time to try and understand all that I was feeling and was there for me when I felt like I had no one. Ending my life was not the solution to happiness. Talking about it, no matter how hard, was a giant step towards healing.|`|zO59ezH3aa	It's a mental thing. U oviously like ur ex. But if u pass up a chance like ur about to get, by that I mean a new guy, than u might never get another chance to be happy.

You are grieving and grieving is a series of about 5 stages that you have to go through to come out okay on the otherside. Some folks can go through it in months, for others (20 years in my case) it may take longer. Grieve counseling is the way to go or just GOOGLE how to handle grieve. You get some helpful advice, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Don't get serious (what is known as a rebound relationship) with any one until this thing with your ex is resolved and DONT have sex with either one of them. No need to muddy the waters worse than what they already are.|`|AA11199260	Dear Friend. You were deeply in love with the guy who has gone away from you. He was in your heart and soul. I think you did not handle your affairs properly. You must have tried to fix with you forever. I mean marriage. I don't know why you did not think about this alternative. However whatever the case may you should not go to think about committing suicide as it will not be a good event in  your life. Be calm and go to church and pray to jesus to help you as he is a silent listener of our prayers.  Good Luck|`|AA11747527	suicide is the easy and selfish way out.  deal with you're problems head on and maybe you can move forward. i personally don't believe in suicide because i think only God has the right to end life.  Our bodies are not ours but God's.  maybe you need some counseling... don't be ashamed.  sometimes people need a little help with life, that is why they are there.  please stay positive and go out with this new guy.  maybe that is all it will take to get you're mind off the other one.  who says you have to have sex with him?  that can wait|`|CVvYhEfGaa	Good lord. where to start....<br>  okay.<br>  DO NOT jump into another relationship, you are not ready! clearly.<br>  it will hurt you and the guy you like if you go out before your ready to, just wait awhile. good things take time. so be patient, and in the end it will benefit you both.<br>  As for sex? just hold off. i mean for a LONG time.<br>  having sex with another person makes your bond to them even stronger. which as its pro's, but when the break up roles around, makes it so much harder to let go. and that pain just isnt worth it.<br>  <br>  my advice to you, is just wait, when your ready, you'll know. just give it some time.|`|Ilq7WEM5aa	Hey, i understand exactly how you feel, I have been in a similar situation, and my best friend has been in this exact situation. She even attempted suicide, but she was found quick thank god, but it took her that far to realise her life wasn't worth losing for this man. You don't need to go that far to realise this hun. Were always gonna have to make diffiult decisions, and have to deal with very hard things in life, but what's meant to be will find it's way remember that. If you're not ready to move on don't force yourself to, if it's not what you want. But maybe you should explain your situation to this guy and see if you can start off as good friends, and see how it goes. You might change the way you feel after a while.<br>  And as for your ex, it's understandable that you love this person so much but sometimes these things happen for a reason. Sure you'll be upset and you may feel like you'll never get over it but time heals and you just have to stay strong and bare with it, suicide isn't the answer for anything. Give it time! <br>  I hope this helped.Good luck x|`|dL6BcJQxaa	Your afraid to let go simply because if your x boyfriend finds out that u are seeing someone else he will never get back with u. In all honesty I advise u to move on stop holding on.Your x boyfriend is having the time of his life going out & being with other girls, believe me while he's out there having the time of his life he's not thinking about u thats 4 sure. Go out & enjoy life meet new people LIFE IS SHORT. GOOD LUCK =)|`|uNazz3HLaa	You need to seek professional advice immediately, like others have stated. Do you have a belief in God? If so, you are aware what a sin it is. It's still murder, even if it's murdering your self. <br>  There is not a single soul worth doing this final act for. There is always someone else on this planet who can give you the love that you so crave. <br>  I was engaged to someone who thought it would be a great idea to be engaged to someone else at the same time. I felt devastated beyond description. I thought I was better off dead too. I was wrong! Very wrong!<br>  It took years to get over the betrayal. I went to God with my problem, and asked Him to give me the strength needed to go on. It was tough, but He got me through.<br>  I hope you have the kind of faith needed to do this. If you don't find someone else who does. Get them to pray for you, and with you. It can only help.|`|LgkonkEbaa	Its ok, you miss your boyfriend alot of pleople go through the same thing your going through, all you need to do is give it some time, naturally humans adapt to their new life you just have to be patient and eventually you will be able to continue and live a happy life and hang out with new guys|`|OmyQFP4Laa	i think you should try and talk to ur ex and see what he says. if he is still saying no then i think you should still move on and go out with that guy you met. if thats not working then you should leave realationships like that for a while, until you get over it <br>   <br>  hope it helps|`|sI3I1nASaa	1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433)<br>  <br>  1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)  <br>  <br>  There is help for you.

And yes Im telling you this now, its hard and its going to be very hard but obviously you have to trust that if you guys do not get back together your not ment to be. As much as you love him you got to let him go and let him be happy. Just keep telling yourself that its for the best. and of course since you were with him for soo long that your going to be shy to the dating world. It's just one of those things where you hold your breath and hope for the best when you fall in. You may be supprised =]|`|bCGfqfi1aa	Its hard to move on from a long relatoinship, sometimes you need time dont just date a guy because yoru ex has moved on. And i know the feeling that it wont let you move on but you have to, i understand you are just scared because you have been hrut but you have to put yoruself back out there or you will never find love. And you might not be ready for sex with someone else yet, you prob should wait. You were just confortable with your ex where you arnt with the new guy or someone else you should wait until you are confortable enoguh to be in that place with him. and you were just so in love with him it jsut wont let you move forward. Your going to have to take the next step sometimes but if you arnt ready to open up to someone new then you should wait so he dont get hurt.|`|gmvOzZ9Taa	i understand its really hard to let go of a person you love<br>  but suicide is deffintely not the answer.<br>  you'll eventually get through this <br>  you may always have this guy in your heart but if your not ready for any other kind of relationship yet then dont be so quick to jump into one<br>  take it slow and see what happens|`|hJUKBCNpaa	im really sorry you're going through this, but you should probably have someone besides people on the internet you can talk to, like friends or a counselor.<br>  <br>  i've been low before, but trust me it gets better|`|kR8Ur3Jxaa	You really should talk to someone you know you can trust. Talk to your friends, parents, brother/sister... It's clear that you're going through a difficult time. You can take comfort in knowing that people do care, and suicide should not be a thought.  Life will go on and WILL get better. My mom always used to tell me that when it seems like it can't get any worse, things have to get better. Talk to the people in your life about your feelings, it helps, I promise!!!!|`|utuevajTaa	Okay, first off i want to let you know that you're not alone! What's happening to you has happened to many people and i know this may sound really cliche but all you need is time. Speaking from experience i know that time will heal everything. I can understand your position right now you feel like you will never be able to move on and be with anybody else the same way how it was with your ex. But my suggestion is to just take this time in your life to be a little bit more selfish. Take care of yourself more and do things that preoccupy your time and make you feel good, it will help you find yourself again and move on. It's great that you've devolped a friendship with this other guy but make sure you take things slow with him as your still recovering from your past relationship. And it would be a good idea if you'd explained to this new guy that you enjoy his company but you'd like to take things slow. This will keep you from pressuring yourself and over time your fear to move on will fade away. Just remember everything will get better in the future and just take more time to yourself more often. I wish you all the best and hope this might have relieved you.|`|vqEaTmU2aa	Okay first off... suicide is NEVER the answer. Contrary to what you may think, your problems are only temporary (believe me, they are!) Suicide... well, it's permanent. Don't even consider it.<br>  <br>  As for your situation... it happens to so many people. It seems to me that this was your first love. I'm sorry it had to end the way that it did, but truly, the best way to get over it is to start a new relationship. You really aren't giving this guy enough of a chance. It doesn't mean you need to start a relationship with him, at the very least he could be someone to talk to about these issues.<br>  <br>  And don't worry about having sex with another person... I wouldn't know this first hand but from what I'm told it's no big deal.|`|wCTq9p2Uaa	Suicide is the worst thing you can do. There are plenty of fish in the sea. I went through a divorce two years ago and now I'm happy with the woman that I met. We go to church, spend time whenever we can with each other. I'm from Texas and in about 3 weeks we plan on going to Santa Fe with some friends for the weekend. So don't let the past get to you. Focus on the good things and not the bad things. Enjoy your life while you are here. You'll be glad you did. Trust me.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	He's not asking you to have sex. He's asking you to hang out. Give it a try, but remember you are only trying it out. If it turns out he's not the one for you or you aren't the one for him, that's not the end of the world.  You are terrified to move on because you don't want to get hurt again.  Please don't commit suicide. It won't help you and it will hurt those around you.|`|RgymoiIQaa	Suicide is a permanent solution to  temporary problems. There are so many people out there that I am sure would love to meet you and get to know you. Don't take yourself out of the game there is still a lot of time left on the clock.|`|ei0Wryytaa	how old are you?<br>  and just remember<br>  there are other fish in the sea<br>  and you are free to go out there <br>  and ask other people|`|0hT85XLzaa	Hun, if you commit suicide - trust me, your problems would have just begun.<br>  <br>  Suicide is cowardly and a major sin.|`|6OzEsanAaa	dont do it! first off! <br>  he left u or u left him because u were to good for him..think about it..if u were good for him! then you would still be together! <br>  <br>  second) i sometimes feel the same way then i think. why would i put my whole family into a sad situation and everyone who loves me just because of a stupid girl [im a boy hehe] and then i think of well theres always a reason to why things happen! i mean <br>  you never know! what if one day! you marry someone who has billions of dollars! just because the the guy that you are with is no longer with you! doesnt mean there isnt any other fish in the sea! <br>  <br>  dont worry! just dont give up on life! because you dont know what your future maybe. trust me! no ex gf or bf is worth dying over because when you get older trust me! you will look back at it and be like pssht i remember how i thought he was perfect! but now hes a bum living on the streets! <br>  <br>  good luck! <br>  <br>  and remmeber! dont do it! even if someone gave you knife or pills to kill yourself! just dont do it! its not worth it! <br>  think about all the people who love you! which weighs more?|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	look killing ones self isn't the answer. yes its sad you and your x broke it off yes you were really close to himand that is fine. its done and you have to move on there are changes in life all the time and we have to move on and accept them. the sleeping part and stuff comes way later just because you did it early with this young man means nothing you are the one that is up to this and if you aren't then let him know now and make it clear to him get to know this person give him a chance i mean love itsn't today or tomorrow it can take very much time a year or so before you knwo or somethings longer you have to maintanin a different type of relationship for a long while and when the time it right you will know take care and move on. I lost love of my life to death and i am just beginning to move its been over 9 mos and i am having hard time but i am not killing myself even though maybe i feel like it its now what God has planned for us move on.
uNazz3HLaa	Hate to be the one to inform you, but your mom is probably right. You don't have a measuring stick to guide you in romance at the age of 13. You haven't experienced the highs and lows involved. You probably experienced the thrill in knowing that someone finds you attractive, and all that. That's not love. It's a joy ride. Take your time. I didn't know what real love was until my 30's. That doesn't mean the same thing will happen to you. It just means that 13 doesn't understand all the consequences and joys involved in true, meaningful, robust love. All the pleasure it brings, as well as the bitter heartache.|`|iOpzTvSpaa	you were in fact in love, and only you would know it to begin with.  love isn't some definition that has set parameters or an age restriction it just happens and you truly know it was love if you really can't explain why you felt the way you did|`|2Ph9ZejBaa	I hate it when parents say that, it annoys me, YES love CAN happen at 13, and dont let anyone else tell you otherwise|`|bhxIEcr8aa	Definately there is no age limit where love is cut off. Yea u may have been young but at da same time you knw wat you're feeling. so if u felt love den dats wat it is.|`|ZSjuhyISaa	its puppy love|`|ZLExTyoNaa	if its love, its love.<br>  if you question it,<br>  than its not love.<br>  <br>  thats my theory.|`|ei0Wryytaa	yes|`|vpmRRamKaa	i think you can be in love at the age of 13, because some people marry there middle school sweethearts or high school sweethearts. im not saying your mom doesnt know what shes talking about, because she probably means well, but everybody has different love interests and how they fall deep. but it was possible that you guys were in love at the age of 13 and 15|`|ff545BLyaa	No there is not a specific age but I can sure as hell tell you that its not 13.  Any 13 year old is not maure enough to understand what love is.  I am 19 and still struggling with this love thing.  I can not imagine being in love with anyone, and I am 19 so I find it very hard to believe you know more than me when I have had 5 different girlfriends...|`|b224773006567fe0674e68a21e1ee238aa	i don't think there's an age... if you both think you're in love then you are! only you and him will ever know if it was love, nobody else can tell what your feelings are but you.|`|oOKsI0QSaa	i don't believe in love at young ages. you were simply infatuated with the guy.

I dunno if it's just me but, I don't think it comes off the same over myspace. If you really want him that bad, be honest about it. Don't come out like an idiot but, tell him in the best way possible. I wish I could help you on what to say but, I can't give you an example I don't know the situation enough to do so.|`|8i46CxZ0aa	Don't be a idiot and talk through myspace. Act like an adult and call. Arrange a friends-with-benefits program. Just set ground rules not to fall in love and follow through to cut it off if it does happen.|`|3ohj5wTZaa	Okay, this isn't something I'd personally do, but just tell him.<br>  I mean, the worst that can happen is he turns you down, and that can't be much worse than when you guys broke up in the first place.|`|bhxIEcr8aa	Well my ex did this awhile back and it really worked but is kinda stupid. tell him you're havin a small get together and really want him to come so guys can talk. corny but effective|`|TZ9SYG7Waa	If you want to make this sexy, don't tell him the heaters fixed, invite him over when he asks to see the car tell him its fine and you wan tto show him something else...

Jordan, girls don't like lazy boys. <br>  Second, get some clothes. I would rather go out with a guy with a little class. (Kind of like skanky girls. Guys get sick of them.

A8kFnvw1aa	Just try to tell her you're sorry and that you didn't know that she didn't like that. I have the same problem right now, I also don't know what to do. I hope things work out for you, though. :)|`|S0QQ6D92aa	Sorry.. it's all you need, really, because there really isn't much u can do, you won't loose your "Crown" for saying that..|`|NGf3l9Otaa	Well you can always afford to cut off some of your "friends" because, deep down, you know who your true friends are. Just think of this person and her followers as a tumor that needs to be removed, surgically.|`|QZHMckOhaa	you could try to approach her and apologise. it would be even more ideal if you could both sit down and have a chat about how you both feel - if she is taking your jokes seriously let her explain WHY. it might give you a better look into her thoughts and it can help you understand what you were saying that was making her upset. after this you can explain anything about the friendship that was troubling you and hopefully you guys can work at being friends again
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	I dont know why you would want your friends knowing how long it lasts anyway but 15 minutes is more than enough time and like you said you are satisfied.. so why are you worried about how long it takes -|`|4mXqv6IZaa	Yes that is very possible without enhancers.  I think statistically, 15 minutes is average.  An hour or more is not the norm but not unheard of.  I'm in my early 40's and an hour is probably average 3 to 4 nights per week.|`|9VsVJ7djaa	Its not how far and how long you travel but the way you reach it is what matters. If you are completely satisfied, then thats it. Your friend is probably just lying to you just to impress you.|`|Eh4f4wXcaa	yeh its possible... my bf n i went a almost 2 hours before not including foreplay (i'm 16 and he's 17)|`|f2RpmfFOaa	we used to have sex for hours on end all nite long when we were your age but now it's for about 6 mins and i'm still completely satisfied|`|x3RGtco8aa	its possible but def not enjoyable|`|NTa6f4hIaa	yes it is.. me and my bf last fr about 30 -45 min  sometimes more. it all depends on the drive that day.;)
K2QwEM4raa	If you had already made up your mind to break up with him for this reason then I think it probably should end. A heated fight over Valentine's day is certainly not a good reason for as you say to get what YOU want. It was nice of him to do that but if you are still asking yourself if you need to break up with him then I think that you need to let him go so that he can find someone more compatible.|`|ZW1xklaAaa	were you with him on vday?|`|e7KoyoWsaa	he may not realize it was important to you, or he may not be emotionally intelligent.  Gifts are nice, but they shouldn't be expected.  If I didn't get my GF something, I wouldn't appreciate being reamed out about it.  If your going to break up with him, do it 'cause your not compatible... who cares about flowers?|`|kfioQ6GGaa	First off, why did he not get you anything for valentines day; was everything sold out?  did he forget?  things like that.  He probably wants you to forgive him.  I wouldent be breaking up just over valentines day even though it is special.  You should call him or something and talk to him.|`|cggkcAC5aa	does he absolutely HAVVVEEE to give you stuff? or do you love hiim for who he is, no matter what things he showers you with?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it would be nice if you could help me too<br>  =]<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226195145AATV4I3">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|xAO51wlRaa	well honestly idk what his excuse was for not giving u anything so therefore i dnt really know wat 2 say??!! <br>  <br>  from wat u mentioned i can only say is that at least he put effort into it..just punish him its not like he forgot ur birthday.<br>  <br>  hope it helps hun! :)
IT77K1gfaa	My friends husband is this way and she won't be with him much longer. He has low self esteem and needs to bring everyone else down with him. He has never experienced true love and doesn't know how to show love either.<br>  <br>  A person like this needs a serious wake up call or will never change, even a wife leaving will just make him angrier and more bitter instead of remorseful.|`|PBdPD748aa	one thing i can say is that he is being that way because it is being allowed, tolerated and accepted......<br>  <br>  well the reasons why i could think of that a man would act that way is that he is taking advantage of his family, he knows they will put up with anything and still be there. he is over comfortable and doesnt have the respect there anymore.<br>  <br>  sounds like there are communication issues that need to be sorted out, maybe husband and wife can be somewhere alone and have a serious chat about their concerns and what has been going on.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Yes I do, and thank God their divorce will be final soon.  They've been married, and worked together, for 25 years.  A marriage made in hell if there ever was one!|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	My husband and I visited a man who he worked with a few years ago. I was appalled to hear him tell his wife to shout-up and tell her she was stupid. He did it in front of us, some of their other friends, and their 3 year old.<br>  <br>  I remember saying something along the lines of, "wow - you're pretty patient. If my husband talked to me like that he'd be gone." I made this comment in front of her husband, but I don't think he got the point. I felt so badly for her. Needless-to-say, we've never heard from them or touched base with them since that day.|`|n8lXItGraa	He's hiding his own insecurities and faults.  He feels better about himself when he belittles and puts down people around him.  It's a source of power. It makes him seem smarter...and more of a man, in his own mind anyway.  He needs a shrink to deal with his issues.  Hope this helps...|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Hopefully he hasn't always been this way because if he has why did you marry let alone have kids?!  Or it can be a brain tumor. I't not a joke. They cause alot of aggresive behavior. Either get a doctor to check him out or get him checked in.|`|dDQLlVF3aa	I have no idea I've been asking myself the same question for 6 years...

T3Mrs8Rfaa	well it kinda depends how do u turn her on just kissing her neck touching a serten spot on her.<br>  <br>  try rubbing your hand up her thigh and touch her vagina with the tip of your fingers. rub softly. then start to unbutton her pants. or take off her shirt.|`|2uINYiMfaa	be aggressive but at the same time be gentile. like push her up on the wall but you have to do it so as not to hurt her. i know its could be hard.|`|3kCQDUUGaa	touch her|`|SSnoi6QPaa	When you're caught up in one of those "moments" with her, push her to wherever is convenient; up against a wall, down on a bed or couch, up onto a counter, whatever.  Push your business all up into her business while kissing her.  Works almost every time.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Ditch her, shes a wh0re. Any girl who would put out that easily.
zdu3gh8jaa	Hi Dayvid,<br>  <br>  I have read your other post and feel it is only natural for you to feel the way you do at the moment. Giving your heart to someone only for them to break it does tend to leave you not wanting to do it again - it's a natural part of self preservation. If I were you I would concentrate on just being kind to myself for a while. Give myself some tlc. It takes time to get over something like this. Many, many years ago I said that I would never marry again. I took time to learn what I wanted and needed for myself and what I expected from a relationship. In fact it turned out to be a good learning experience for me. Some months after the divorce, still with no intentions of getting married ever again, I met the most wonderful caring and loving man that I could have ever wished to meet. I have now been married to him for 21 years and I'm so glad that I am.<br>  At the moment you are only registering the hurt that your ex created, but in time, this hurt and anger will subside and you will be ready and more prepared to have another relationship.<br>  I hope this helps in some way, you sound like the sort of man that most women would love to have as a husband. Take things slowly and best wishes to you for a really happy future.|`|wkHQ3QL5aa	Don't give up on marriage forever. Eventually you'll find the right person, just wait (:<br>  <br>  I know it might be hard now, but from a little bit of experience, I was absolutely in love with this guy and things ended badly. <br>  Now I'm with an amazing guy and saying if we never had broken up, I wouldn't be with this guy now.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Hope everything goes well <3|`|YzObEmUqaa	Without giving me any headache<br>  I would calculate my loss...<br>  Consult with an attorney to have the visitation rights resolve<br>  <br>  A lesson learnt <br>  Next time don't jump into marriage too soon|`|8tMnKEFFaa	How can you say that someone who loved you and you loved her was evil?  noone should be bitter . That is a very large word|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	I will get drummed for this, and I don't even pretend it's accurate, but if it helps you move on,<br>  <br>  Most Russian woman I've met (3), that is, the ones who were rich enough to come over here, have been to some extent shallow, vain, and not inclined to emphasize love.  They marry for other reasons.  One, I definitely know married for the greencard.  Yours probably did it for the money.<br>  <br>  Some were normal, some were awful, but none of them were somebody I would describe as having a heart of gold.<br>  <br>  In other words I'm blaming the culture, especially if she is from Moscow.<br>  <br>  I'm slamming a minority of women so I can make the larger point that most women are not like that.  For instance, Czech girls are very nice ...
8EgftXwXaa	Well have you been talking to her for a while? Like do you hang out with her on weekends and what not? If you do then maybe shes trying to let you know that she kinda likes you!!<br>     However, dont take so seriously as to think she actually Loves You. It wouldnt be the first time in history a girl has liked her friends bf, but kept it to herself for obvious reasons. If you think shes pretty cool, be open to the fact that she may like you. (you were talking for a while, so id just be cool about it.)  Whatever you do!!! do NOT lead her on, or make her think that you like her, if you really dont!! thatd be pretty mean, and then every girl that she knows would think you were an asshole, ruining ur future chances with any of them!|`|TR91FM5Faa	I'm a girl I say luv u to guys all the time she means like a brother or just a buddy
4MyurRdDaa	I would be thinking that its a little weird that you comment on all those things on facebook but never talk to me in school.  But, Its not really stalking, you should talk to him more in school.  So when you do comment on all those things it will seem much less weird.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	May be she likes you and trying to be your friend.|`|PAv7xQjSaa	Yes, I know I'm not a guy, but I am going to answer anyway.<br>  <br>  It is kind of weird. It wouldn't be if you talked to him more. I have people that i facebook chat with on a regular basis, but if I don't talk to them in person or if the chats aren't on a personal basis (more than "hey, what are you doing this weekend") then it's weird. If you post on the random photo or status on occasion, that is fine. "Always" doing it is not cool. <br>  <br>  The only people who you should "always" comment on are you good friends or someone that you know likes you and does the same thing to you. Doe he comment on your stuff all the time?<br>  <br>  The whole concept is sort of in the realm of adults that leave repeated voicemails letting someone know they don't have any messages from them and are just calling to "check and see if they tried to call and maybe the answering maching was broken."  Seems desperate. If you like him, just tell him.|`|EDD7QbVxaa	I'd get the impression that she liked me a little, and wanted to talk, and be more involved in my life. But if I had no interest in her, it might seem a little weird.|`|xrsUt1Fzaa	He likes you.<br>  <br>  Obsessive? Probably<br>  <br>  Weird? Eh, depends what you think, but I think it's obsessive, which isn't weird, just nothing I like to see in someone. Stalking? Not really.|`|W6o3UQLkaa	dont do it all the time, i have a girl who does that and says she likes me and says luv ya and stuff and i dont like her and its annoying...<br>  but i try to be nice|`|4e9a63209954f9c19fc65c6882ece7f4aa	he likes you|`|iOpzTvSpaa	I think i'd start to think she was either really weird or wanted to get to know me better, try to let him initiate the conversation once in a while (depending on what you're trying to achieve) but make sure that you're comments always have an air of humor in them or else yeah, it'll turn weird fast|`|nWpIDNYYaa	well depends on what degree. is he comenting every singls satus and photod? is he always tryin 2 chat w/ u? he also may just be a guy w/ no balls and is still tryin to figure out how to talk 2 a girl. or no effense either he is embaressed to talk to you in front of his friends or. this could b a number a reasons ur pick good luck|`|4G6KDLG8aa	nahh.<br>  its just facebook.

bSkYYRrEaa	Believe me she won't stay. She may be sexy and nice, but she also probably has a high, high sex drive that can get you left or cheated on if you don't immediately give her what she wants. Find someone you can stay with and be happy with for a long time, someone who you can live and learn with, someone who will love you like you love her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. *hugs* MM|`|JO3HiGfHaa	No, what's wrong with you? Their's nothing wrong with a girl who's had sex with another guy (as long as it's prior to your relationship with her). Now after a certain amount of times it's gross, but that can happen with only one guy also.<br>  <br>  I try not to get into discussion like this with my girlfriend because I would get angry, I know about her life before me but I still avoid talking about it. It's no different then her before she knew me though, and that's how you should look at it.|`|4mXqv6IZaa	As long as she didn't do it while you guys were dating, it is not an issue.  You have to respect her for her honesty.  Some girls and guys would lie about it.  If you care about her and think you guys may have a future, past sex should not be an issue.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	BAIL YOU CRAZY BIRD!!!!<br>  <br>  Just run for it dude. There are plenty of girls that won't cheat. Just get rid of this one. Tell her to f*ck off the next time you see her. Be a bada$$.|`|S3uLASLnaa	Leave her, she wasnt commited to you. I would care if i were you, she crossed the line with cheating, but with 5 guys!?! thats way over the line.|`|kzIVGEfgaa	Don't bail if you like her. That shouldn't be a reason to leave. however, you should be careful if sex comes up and make sure it's not too soon or for the wrong reason.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	airstrike on her house's coordinates|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Yeah you should move on.|`|KSMU64ssaa	Wow. Well, unless she had sex with them when you were both dating each other, which she didn't, I wouldn't say break up with her. <br>  But if you think about the fact that she isn't a virgin a lot, break up. Why lead her on when you're just not comfortable with who she's been with? You have the right to choose what kind of girl you want to be dating.|`|iOpzTvSpaa	Well that depends on why she told you, if she just told you and it seemed out of the blue it could be that she thinks your special and doesn't want to hide anything from you than i don't think you should but if you heard it through someone else and asked her yeah, i drop the ***** like hot potatoe|`|nWU0pQTsaa	BAIL!! <br>  I feel the same. I'd like my first time to be with someone thats a virgin too. If i was a guy and i wanted someone for a serious relationship and think of her a the mother of a future family I'd want a good girl. It is up to you.|`|1mRgh2Scaa	No of course not. That's what dating around is about. I mean it doesn't have to be sex but she did it. It's in the past. If you feel like she is just gonna use you then you should wait. See where the relationship goes before doing the deed|`|KWv0IDSZaa	psh. your a dumbass, BAIL!<br>  let me tell you when a girl has sex with five other guys it's cause she's bored of you and not interested anymore and so she is just going to keep using you, just move on and find someone else.|`|IsYYr9Vraa	you're a virgin how cute. i must say move the fu*k on.<br>  your gonna be number six, while she is your number one.'there is so much stds.noo u can find better.<br>  <br>  i hope i can find a male virgin to lose my virginity too.|`|1l7bK325aa	don't say you feel like another "used" towel<br>  if you continue to not care you are going to be another one of those that lose their virginity to this oh-her-way-to-pros.|`|QD2AJv22aa	id be out. you dont know what lies beneath.

After all, if you like her and she likes you it could all work out|`|F4XKQKt2aa	i kind of agree, but that shouldn't be the only reason you dump her. if you really like HER then keep her (:|`|1TETqLxmaa	are u Fuckin retarded???? is tat gf or a ho?|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Well I guess it depends... is being with another virgin that important to you? If so than being with this girl is kind of moot at this point. It might also depend on how old you two are and how recently she's had sex with other guys. I mean if she had sex with 5 guys in one year that's kind of a red flag and yeah I'd probably bail on her if I were you. <br>  <br>  But if you're in your 20's and you've had several different partners, I don't think its such a big deal. If you do stay with her, make sure you go with her and have her tested for STDs. You don't want to end up with herpes or some God awful disease.|`|wWzO9xARaa	I agree that it feels more special to lose your virginity to another virgin. It is up to you obviously 100% but I would rethink having sex with them because I wouldn't want to be just someone they had sex with I would want them to remember it and remember me for their first time, and I would want to remember them as my first time. I lost my virginity to my boyfriend who was also a virgin at the time, and now that i'm not a virgin anymore I wouldn't have sex with a virgin.|`|KSUksBZkaa	if you are meaning she had sex w/ 5 guys BEFORE yall got together, then i would consider staying with her. she can't change her past. what's important is the present and whether she is an honest person. she DID admit it. <br>  <br>  if you are saying she cheated on you w/ 5 other guys then forget her.|`|vpmRRamKaa	okay its good that she was truthful with you. shows that she cares about you and might loveyou, but hecks no this chick slept around with five (not one) but five guys, if you dont run then i know you have problems|`|ff545BLyaa	BAIL BAIL BAIL!!!!  5 other guys! how did a guy like you even start going out with her!  Get out now!|`|9dMc4ZMRaa	No offense, but why would you date a whore?

2o3BHgCCaa	Ok, so most of the 'flab' is on the underside of the arms.<br>  Get a chair and sit down. <br>  Put your palms face down on the chair seat either side of your legs. Slide your bum off the chair and use your arms to hold your weight as you lower your bum down to just above the floor.<br>  Raise up and repeat untill it hurts too much.<br>  This will tone underneath your upper arms.<br>  <br>  As for the upper body clasp your palms together at breast height and squeeze/ tighten all your chest and arm muscles. Repeat.<br>  This on is good to develop your pecs meaning it will help support your breasts as well (helps keep them high!)|`|cCymTwdcaa	The classic, elbow to knee, and pull the arm in toward your should works well. Also, with your feet shoulder width apart, raising your arms straight up and bringing them down in the classic "flex pose" is another exercise.

Standing with your arms straight out to the sides do slow, small circles forwards/backwards.  This works your arms, shoulders & upper back!  You can do this anywhere, anytime...and you don't need any weights...but you can definitely use 1-2 lb. ones.   I like to stand up and do it during commercials...sadly I can only make it through 2-3 which is around 1-2 min.  Good Luck!  Know that I am doing the same thing...for my wedding...which is also about 4 mos away :)
1bubNOQmaa	I think you should take some time for yourself before you seriously date anyone.  Sure, get out there and go on casual dates, but make a firm commitment to yourself to stay single (ie, not committed) for at least 6 months.  Take this time to figure out what you want, what you won't accept, and to re-learn who you are as an individual (not a part of a couple).  Many people don't take this time and end up getting into a relationship with all of the same problems as their prior relationship.<br>  <br>  There is no set time frame for when you can call something a relationship; really any communion with another is a relationship just some are more casual than others.  But to actually call the other person your boyfriend or significant other should only happen after you and he have agreed to be exclusive.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you are not part of an ultraconservative culture or religion.  That being the case, you can have that first kiss whenever it feels right to do it.  If after one date you really feel like you've connected with someone, try that exploratory kiss.  If you're still not sure if there is a connection, hold off until you're sure or move on to someone else.<br>  <br>  Sex is a tougher issue to answer.  Again, I am assuming you are not part of an ultraconservative culture or religion.  If so, this again should only come when you feel a connection with someone.  Too many newly single people make the mistake of being overly promiscuous and end up regretting it.  <br>  <br>  For all of this, just take your time.  You need to heal, you need to reconnect with yourself, and then you can focus on trying to move to another relationship.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Well first things first<br>  <br>  Your not still 'kinda' young.<br>  <br>  You ARE young! 24? Common girl, you are still a spring chicken!<br>  <br>  As far as dating goes, boost your own self confidence and men will flock<br>  <br>  There is no normal time, as long as you dont rush then whenever it feels right is the right time.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Just take it one step at a time. There is no time frame. You have to go with what you are comfortable with. Don't do anything until you feel comfortable with it. You could start out by going out with a group of single people that you work with or a good friend. This will help you to get back out there in the world. It is what I did and after a while a began to feel comfortable with dates and met the man I am now married to. Yes, there is life after divorce even if you have a bunch of kids.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	I think that all of your "time frame" questions boil down to a personal issue.  The first kiss sometimes happens right away but I sure wouldn't even consider sex unless the relationship was established and you know your going to be seeing someone exclusively.  I know that a lot of people think of sex as a recreation but I think it has a lot more meaning if your in a relationship.  You'll be able to fall in love with someone if it's not just about the sex.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	when you have the divorce papers you can date. but never never kiss the first secon or third time. you take your time. its for you to have fun and relax.  sex shoudl be furtherest from your mindmost men will date someone that is divrocecd cause they feel they want sex now. that is understatement. i would wait awhile until you really know the man and are sure of what he and you want. dont' jump into be with every tom dick and harrry that will get you bad reputation.|`|KSK22vHUaa	It took me a year to start dating again, but I take things slowly.  This does not meant at all that it should take that long, or that it shouldn't.  That's just how long it took me.<br>  <br>  It's a relationship when you're both seeing each other exclusively for a few months, and/or have discussed and agreed to call it a relationship.  <br>  <br>  Take sex slowly, given your situation.  Have it when you feel you're ready, but I would really suggest waiting at least 3 good dates or a couple of months.  Don't be too easy--even if it's un-intentional.  Guys your age now are much more charming than when you were last single.<br>  <br>  And for kissing, I kiss on the first date when I'm really interested in someone.  I think that's a good marker, honestly.  Otherwise you might not get called back--kissing is a good sign of liking someone.  I'm not saying make out for four hours in the back of his jeep.  But a kiss goodnight, or a minute or two at the end of the date, is totally okay.<br>  <br>  And one of my good friends is learning this the hard way.  It should be obvious, but unfortunately it isn't:  bars and dance clubs are NOT good places to meet good men.  They are easy places to meet easy men!<br>  <br>  Good luck dear ( :
W8F9PboZaa	I have a friend whose parents are a little like that, although not as bad. When she was 17 her parents wouldn't let her go to a sleep over if there would be boys there. And i mean boys who are our best friends. Obviously they're not going to rape her. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry to say it but she ended up just lying. Then she got caught out and that ended her social like for the next 6 months. Her parents are still really protective now despite the fact that she's 18 and an adult. They won't let her go clubbing or anything, it's ridiculous. But in saying that she had a boyfriend when she was 15 and they didn't mind that as long as things weren't sus or anything. <br>  <br>  Don't say you'll never get a boyfriend. At your age I thought I'd die a spinster and no one would ever want me. I live in an area where it seems everyone looks like a super model, and I definitely don't. It wasn't great for my self esteem but by the time I was 16 or 17 I just grew out of it I guess. I'm 18 now and have had a boyfriend who i love to death for going on a year. You'll find someone. Once you get older things just patch themselves together.<br>  <br>  As for your mum not trusting you, I get that. My mother implicitly trust me and my youngest sister (despite the fact my youngest sister drinks, smokes and looks like a complete emo). My middle sister, who probably is the most trust worthy of all of us, isn't ever allowed to go out. Mum doesn't like her friends and is completely irrational about it. She was the same with me when I was in grades 8-10. <br>  <br>  Look my only advice is that maybe it will get better as you get older. The day i reached 17 I was allowed to do whatever I wanted basically. For now just try and rationalize with her. Tell her you love her and respect your culture and religion and you wouldn't to do anything that would go against either. Say something along the lines of "I know you trust me and I would never want to betray that trust" even if she doesn't trust you. It'll make her look and feel like the bad guy then. This is me assuming that she thinks you're going to do something with the boys. Even if she doesn't have a reason for not letting you go just spin the same BS. Help out heaps around the house (this is my latest tactic) so maybe you'll get in her good books. Let her feel like she has the control. "you can pick me up whenever you want, I don't have to stay the entire time if you don't want" (make sure the "if you don't want" is in there, again making her the bad guy). Make the event your going to much more important than it actually is like just then I rang my mum asking if i could sleep at my friends house tonight and was going on about how my friends moving tomorrow and she doesn't want to be alone in her house for the last night. Complete bullshit but it appeals to mum's sympathetic side. But in saying that i'm not even going to my friends, I'm going to my boyfriends. So yeah lying is the best but if not then try those tactics^|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Wow.. i dont know.. maybe she just doenst what you to get hurt or something? alot of teens get hurt by thinking they "love" one another when in the end of what ever happens they get hurt (i dont mean sex, i mean you get phyically closer to the person and you tell them alot and when you guys break up, that makes it worst) maybe your mom just thinks of that? or that she knows some guys are werid.. i think she should give ur GUY friends a chance throw... ^^ all guys arent that bad...|`|BjtqWNt8aa	How old are YOU??  You may not be old enough for a boyfriend as far as your Mother is concerned. Wait until you can get out on your own, or wait until she says its ok...your life is in front of you...don't rush it, enjoy it. A Romantic relationship with a Boyfriend is not what its cranked up to be when you are less than 18/19, neither are romantic relationships with girlfriends....
LA2nJToYaa	It seems to me she has some sort of Psycologial issues reguarding the aspects of sex...I beleive the whole religious cop out is because she wants an excuse to keep it from happening. A true celebiate based on religious reason does not engage in fornication whatsoever. My advice would be to get her to a sex theripist if she is willing. If not I simply suggest being her friend and not her lover. Also the bible does permit sex in marriage and it is encouraged to build a long lasting one...so I don't understand why she is wiling for marriage with no sex. She needs counsel definatly....either that or get her in a convent.|`|ptclgKl5aa	Yeah, I have no problem waiting for marriage with a girl, but once I'm married I'll want me and her to make up for lost time so to speak.  That doesn't make any sense to me, what kind of religion is she?|`|KSUksBZkaa	if she is into the other stuff then religion or not she will end up wanting it eventually. it's human nature. you can only do so much before you can't take it anymore. even the Bible rejoices sex within marriage. she apparently has a misconception of the word celibate. it means no sexual activities PERIOD. so i think the bigger question would be why is she doing it? she SAYS it's cuz of her religion but if it were that, then why would she still do the other things? maybe she is just using that as an excuse? maybe she just doesn't want to have sex for some reason. you need to tell her that if she isn't willing to have sex then yall aren't even going to do the other things. explain to her that it's sort of like teasing you ya know? it's not fair. of course she doesn't owe you sex so don't make it sound like that's what you mean cuz it will just piss her off. seriously, it sounds like you need to sit down and have a long talk with her.<br>  <br>  oh and ask yourself too, is it love or lust?|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Why are you even doing these things with her, if you aren't even in a relationship?  And yet you claim to love each other?  This is too weird for words. <br>  <br>  She is either very religious, or very wacky, or both.  She has told you what her plans are.

You can probably hold out longer than she can, honestly.  Ask if she really wants to just wait until she's married to have sex - and maybe you'll agree on that - and if you really love each other, go ahead and propose.  So romantic!  Otherwise, look up the number for the local Catholic church and direct in that direction for connections to become a nun... because she can marry Jesus then!  ;)|`|79697512e1b4802bb434d1469903bedbaa	is she interested in having kids? because from what i've heard, you need o have sex for that.<br>  my friend was vowed to be celibrate for life, then she found this boy and was with him for 2 years and during those two years they fooled around alot, all but sex. and then before you knew it they had sex. i think you just need to build up that trust. she will also want to know you wont leave her. gooood luck!|`|aMHIA7XMaa	I think it's time to move on.

Usually a lifelong vow of celibacy requires one NOT to marry, so if she gets married, she is breaking that vow.<br>  "A vow of celibacy is a promise not to enter into marriage or engage in sexual intercourse. The term involuntary celibacy has recently appeared to describe a chronic, unwilling state of celibacy." Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  If she does not have sex with you after marriage, your marriage can not be consummated. The act of sex is (according to most mainstream Christian religions that I am familiar with) is to bring man and woman together as one. If you are not together as one at any point, then you are not truly together as man and wife. Most churches (even ones that preach against divorce) will consider that a good reason for one.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you about your relationship with her. That is pretty heavy. She needs to figure out if she wants to be truly celibate for life or if she wants marriage. As I said above, most religions require you to stay unmarried. It is part of lifelong celibacy. <br>  <br>  If you want a better understand, you can ask her religious leader yourself. As for advice, tell them the truth about how you both feel, etc. (S)he may have some good suggestions or words of wisdom.<br>  <br>  Above all, remember that love is not enough to sustain a marriage (not saying that you need to have sex in order to have a good marriage, just that you need more than love) and sometimes you have to look at the reality and see whether or not you can be with someone for life. Regardless of what problems you may or may not have and how different they may be from a couple next to you, you always have to look and see what's better for both of you, and if you truly love each other, you may need to be without one another.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon.|`|PmYpNontaa	Sorry this is a girl answering.  You have a young lady with issues around sex and you are a young guy, and she is hornier than hell with religion on her shoulder.  You are dealing with a young lady with issues about sex.  Come on....it's not healthy to "remain celibate for life for religious" reasons. What religious reasons????.... Please!!!!!   And look at what she considers celibate......these are not celibate activities.  Especially when you do so much sexually and that is okay with her  and apparently on some level okay with you.  I would imagine that she is on a tight list (shall I say it...Catholic, Mormon doctrine) that sex is bad .It's a control issue and you have a lady that is trying to have sex but be appropriate with sex, religion and a little hmmmm sacrificing.  Sorry, this isn't a love situation, it's a hormonal  in the moment situation.,,,,hormones rule.  Don't think with your ding a ling. AND you both are very young....if you are confused about these things with this woman you need some down time to think about what is going on with you.  All in all.....this is not good relationship material,  it is actually dysfunctional relationship material.  It's okay to be young....don't be naive.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	Well, celibacy refers to all sexual activity...so basically she has already failed...<br>  <br>  and she doesn't want kids? that would make me so upset...if i never had sex i guess i could deal with that...but not being able to have children and a family...what kind of religious belief is that??<br>  <br>  Anyway, i wouldn't get involved...if she claims to want to remain celibate for life, and you don't agree with it...its not worth it.  You don't go into a relationship hoping to fix things about someone...its not right, and it never works out.<br>  <br>  Some may think im shallow for saying so, but this is a completely legitimate reason for not dating someone...waiting till marriage is one thing...and that's smart if its waht you believe...but celibacy for life is a hard pill to swallow, and i challenge her to find a happy marriage with a good guy with that kind of lifestyle...|`|iOpzTvSpaa	I think if she really loved you and you voiced your concerns she would respect them, the fact that she wants to remain celibate till death means religion comes before you in her book, depending how you take that should determine how you respond<br>  ps: what exactly are the other types of sexual activity that don't include or and well sex?|`|4MyurRdDaa	try exploring some more sexual acts without doing IT.  But i have a feeling that she wont be able to not have sex for life.

I totally understand if she only wants to wait until marriage but NEVER!  What if you want kids one day? Will you have to adopt? If you want to have sex when you're married and have kids one day...then you have to sit down and explain that you respect her decision but you also have to consider your needs and wants as well...good luck|`|4y7fjl5iaa	well, if u are willing to wait until marriage thats good, but having a sexless marriage in my opinion is not healthy. maybe if u havent already u should tell her u have an interest in marrying her some day and u want to have sex when ur married. i dont understand why she would be willing to do everything u say... usually they dont do anything,|`|BAq1oQZoaa	I just have to say freedomlighter's answer is super stupid, don't even consider listening to that crap.

Move on ... <br>  <br>  To change her mind talk to her about marriage and how you want a family one day and if she really loved you that she would share that same dream one day to...  Ask her why she likes to participates in sexual activities but not sex its self ... And dude you have to realize you guys aren't in a relationship she could just be telling you that because you guys aren't actually  together ... <br>  <br>  so just get with her and get counseling....   PEOPLE tell what religion suggest life long celibacy ?|`|a71dc93591206d19404fc90e323c10faaa	Ask her questions about her religion. Like does it say in the bible that she should never have sex or is she just saying that for the purpose that she does not want to have sex until she is married. The bible does say you should wait until you get married and if that is what she is worried about then if you are willing to wait for her until then let her know that and maybe that will be a relieve for her. Look up some scriptures together and maybe that can not only bring you 2 closer but give you a more insight of where she is coming from and why she is choosing this path.

I am just so sorry about your circumstances.  <br>  <br>  Losing a mom at a young age is brutal enough (I lost my mom at a young age, too), without matters being compounded by your father suffering a stroke, and an older sister who is apparently emotionally unstable, remarkably conniving, and utterly lacking in empathy.  I am so sorry you are having to deal with all this, on top of so monumental a loss of your mother and the subsequent disability of your father.<br>  <br>  Under normal circumstances, I would recommend that you hang in there with your sister, on account of her being so close to your school.  But in this case, I feel compelled to recommend an alternative pursuit, in the hopes that it is all feasible.<br>  <br>  You imply that your uncle is someone who is 100% behind you.  If it is possible for you to do so, I would telephone him to say, in as calm a voice as possible, that you have something you need to discuss with him, and that it is urgent enough that you would like to meet with him at his earliest possible convenience (AWAY from your sister's home).  When you then get together with your uncle, I would explain to him (again, in as calm and as level a fashion as you can muster) that, while you understand that your sister's living so close to your school would indicate that her home is an "ideal" place for you to live, it isn't turning out that way at all.  Stressing that you, in no way, wish to be a burden on anyone (maybe mention that it is no one's fault, including yours, that your mother died and your father had a stroke), you are striving, under difficult circumstances, to live as emotionally  healthy a life as possible.  Go on to explain why living with your sister, while convenient to your school, has turned out to be so detrimental to your mental health (and possibly even hers) that you are now dangerously at wit's end.  By way of example, you should be frank with him about the utter lies your sister has told him about your "having sex" and "coming home late." Further explain that, given the emotional stresses you are experiencing under your sister's roof, you fear that your grades are likely to seriously suffer (which is inevitably the case when one's home life is this stressful).  <br>  <br>  You say you don't have anyone else to stay with "so that [you] can go to school."  Never mind, for the moment, being close to a public school.  Would your uncle allow you to stay with him?  If so, you can easily continue your schooling online.  You needn't be anywhere near a public school to continue your education!  There is so much available now for those who pursue their education outside of the public school system, and such students often make far greater progress than they ever would in the public schools.<br>  <br>  The important thing right now for you is to find a home environment that is far more nurturing, and far less stressful, than the one in which you are now ensconced.  It doesn't matter how close in proximity you are to a  public high school.  If your home life is this stressful, you not only will not be able to perform at your best academically, but you are in danger of faltering emotionally, from all the stress you have already endured over the past few years.<br>  <br>  If, in response, your uncle should throw up his hands, saying "you don't have a choice, you HAVE to stay with your sister," then let's cross that bridge when and if  we get there.  In the meantime, let's just hope for the best, come what may. (Do keep in touch with us here.)<br>  <br>  Keeping you much in my thoughts and wishing you all the best.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	OMG!! im soooo sorry!! that sucks.. really thrwo.. uhmmm.. i think you should stay away and i feel sorry for her kids. but whos knows maybe you where steping on her toes? or something, or she was PMSing that day? i think you should stay away throw.. thats not healty... at all... but tahts about all i can tell you|`|tzDbzR18aa	1. call your uncle up and tell him whats going on!<br>  <br>  2. if that dusent work try staying with a friend!|`|WIsxqR7caa	Does you uncle touch your ipod?|`|M4BDKcO7aa	You should talk with your sister. Not talking never solved anything. Maybe she doesn't understand you side of the story or just needs a little talking too. Also, try to be considerate of her stress and situation. You never understand a person until you walk around in their shoes. You'll have be forgiving (right or not it's her home) and approach the situation with a compromise. Be careful to word you phrases relating to you and never say "you did this...". <br>  The more of the compromise, and the more that she understands you, the more likely you are to win your privacy.<br>  There's always the chance of rejection (if she's really stubborn) but it's worth a try.<br>  I wish you luck.|`|AA10411428	Well, first of all this sound like a aweful situation...and i'm so sorry about your mom and now your dad...sounds like you and your sister are in a stressful/sad situation....first things first never hate anyone...i'm sure there are promblems between you and your sister and it sounds like you 2 need to sit down and have a long talk about how your both feeling...tell her the things that are bothering you, her yelling and all and let her talk to you....i'm sure since she has 2 kids and now your living there and i'm sure she has to work she is stressed out and it when your stressed it makes you grouchy.....when you pack your stuff and threaten to leave she tells you shes gonna tell your uncle stuff?///i know its bad but think about it....she doesnt' want you to leave, that right there shows she cares...she thinks if she threatens to tell your uncle this stuff you won't leave which leads me to believe she wants you there, i'm sure she loves you but with all thats going on she's full of anger and saddness, the best thing to do would be to go tell her you 2 need to talk...tell her whats bothering you and listen to her feelings as well,,,i'm sure this will help alot.....hope it all works out and you'll be in my prayers...|`|uEWZSVwyaa	your sister is wrong for doing that sisters always argue i know me and my sister do but that shouldbe the one person yo can go to to talk to but things do seem to be very hard for yo at the moment but it ill be okay jut stay focused in school and don't get discouraged in a couple years you will be on your on anyways.

If you think its bad now, just wait until you have kids!  <br>  <br>  If the washer is a front loader the socks go down in the opening around the drum (mine is and I am always pulling socks out of there)  If its a top loader the socks go over the top of the drum and drops into the inside of the washer.

Get it all down on paper, 2 witnesses signatures and notorized bfore going into court. You can tell thecourt at time of filing for divorce youve already done this or call and tell them.

If kids are involved, work out child support and visitation times. Mother will almost get custody in court unless ruled unfit or refuses custody.

Sorry about your marriage and good luck|`|aeLyiRczaa	First, unless your mate cheated on you, you do not have scriptural grounds for divorce or for acting badly toward your spouse.  I also tell you that if you would not have relations and in effect, partially shoved your mate to cheat, then you bear responsibility for them doing so to a point.<br>  <br>  Now, whether you believe in God or what he said doesn't matter.  You can decide not to believe in gravity either, but you will still fall down because of it.  God does not need your agreement or permission for his rules to be in effect, to include over you.<br>  <br>  Almost any marital problem can be corrected, if both parties will work at making themselves better people and treating the other as they are compelled to do by virtue of the fact they are married to one another.   In most cases, it is that the people involves will not stop being selfish and they will not allow things to be fixed.<br>  <br>  Do not believe that because you do not know how it can be fixed means it cannot be.  You don't have to know why a plane stays aloft to fly, now do you?<br>  <br>  Be honest with you about you.  You need to take a very hard and realistic look at yourself and find out just what kind or person and what kind of mate you are.  That will help you see how much of what is wrong is your doing.<br>  <br>  Realize that your emotions are terribly fallible.  How many times have you thought wrongly of another and then found out that you had it wrong?  How many times have you felt like choking the devil out of someone?  Did you?  Why?  Same principal.  Feelings are not necessarily good to go with at times.  In fact, if you will read 1 Cor. 13, you will find that love is not really an emotion but actions.  Love is described in how you act, not what you feel.  Frankly, many times when we start to act nice or happy even when we are not, it begins to make us happier and nicer.<br>  <br>  Do not think that because so many give up or divorce, it is okay.  The world is full of sin and it is full of excuses for doing wrongly.  It is also full of people who itch to help you see things wrong or to do wrong.  Many times just to make them feel less wrong in what they have done.  Misery loves company and it loves back up.  Believe that you will still pay the price.<br>  <br>  Realize that what you thought marriage would be like is not necessarily accurate or rational.

N7mgfDxnaa	you need to stop worrying about what other people think of you. its good that you have enemies, it shows you've stood up for something. its great that you care, but she's over it. you should be too, she doesn't want closure. you cant convince her of that, and if you do, it doesn't mean anything because you pushed it. my advice is seriously, f*ck what other people think, because at the end of the day all you have is yourself. you need to learn how to be your own best friend, and you need to please yourself before you can please anyone else. shes stupid, forget her. she doesn't know whats good for her, but it makes you look like a pussy if you keep trying to apologize. grow a backbone, and i mean that in the nicest possible way. you can't waste your life thinking about closure with some female friend who didn't like the way she was being treated, especially when you've apologized. you've done all you can.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Woah, if I were your friend, I wouldn't talk to you either!  You have no right to ask for such a thing.  LISTEN:  IT DOESN'T MATTER.  Here's why:  you are being such an insecure head case, that you would drive anyone away.  I'm not meaning to be harsh - but insecure people always do that.  You MAKE it a self-fulfilling prophecy that they will leave, because all the time they spend with you is like the Spanish Inquisition.  That's about as much fun as dental surgery, and sane, sensible people want to get away from that.  You took (1) and turned it into (2).  Don't you get it?  <br>  <br>  Please get counseling.  You will drive every friend away from you if you keep on the way you are.|`|fTjG1KGLaa	first if she was lying about stupid bull$hit then...who cares? let her dream and have an imaginary little lifestyle. but now lets ASSUME she was never lying, was the perfect friend and all that bull$hit.

Then just put it away.  Then calm down.  Take a few days, you'll realize you probably didn't do anything all that horrible at all.  Sounds like you wanted it to be more than a friendship and you were jealous.... it's a type of love reaction actually.  Friendship love is the best... but the flip side of all love is jealousy and anger.  Is this what's going on?  Still, she made up her mind so don't become a stalker.|`|CVvYhEfGaa	I had a friend like you once, he treated me like ****, but i loved him deeply. i had to let go of him because he was hurting me so much. SO much. he apologized, but im not ready to accept it, cause i havent healed form the pain he caused, im protecting myself, and thats probably what shes doing. if she means that much to you, give it a little time, then talk to her about it.|`|EoeCcTEcaa	i think yes  you had the right to ask her for more  time to spend together but you used the wrong approch try again|`|FGLQdpafaa	The thing is that you can never stop these feelings or stop hoping. You can only allow those feelings to diminish.,,,but they will always be there...<br>  <br>  Well, did you ever try to talk to her? Find out what she was thinking? Maybe she didn't know what to do...? Are you still talking to her now? Did she know that you guys were close friends? ...maybe she didn't want to hurt you...and thought that you needed time by yourself? <br>  <br>  I was in a similar situation...being the girl. I had this awesome friend...and he admitted his feelings for me. I never had someone like me...but a few years back I used to like this guy, who was a very close friend. He didn't like me back...so all I wanted was space. I decided to push him back, and give him the space (I wanted from the guy I used to like). I also admitted that I've never been placed in such a situation...so I felt awkward with him. All I really wanted was for things to go back to normal...but I didn't know how. I probably acted wrong, but I never meant to act in that way.<br>  <br>  So, I guess it is your call. If you feel that she really honestly wronged you...let it go.<br>  If not, talk it out with her. If it bothers you that much,  call her and see if you can the honesty or even dishonesty in her voice.<br>  <br>  It's for you to decide.
CO1CiN6Haa	Well Marco, as a parent myself I can't figure it out. I remember feeling just like you when I was a teenager. My parents just didn't understand a thing and what they thought was important had nothing to do with what I thought was important. I wanted to do things my way. I guess it is the beginning of maturity. I can promise you this, as a parent, we are clueless of what to do. You are pulling away and we are wondering if we have done something wrong. That is where the wanting to talk comes in, trying to find something that will connect us to you again. My advice would be to hug your parents often, accept them for being clueless, and help them get through this pulling away. Tell them what great parents they have been and offer to do a big chore once a week. That keeps us pretty satisfied. Also, come home from school and announce what a great day it has been at least twice a week. Let me know if this helps, if it does, can you please tell my teenager. He won't listen to me any more.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Because teenagers wanna do what they wanna do...they usually fail to consider the consequences...Mom and Dad have been there, done that and don't want their kids to endure the same things they had to endure...so they set limits that teenagers don't like...and of course...teenagers assign a different meaning to "cool" than parents do. Its not until they are quite a bit older that teenagers realize that Mom and Dad were once kids and know what cool really  is.|`|NBo2ucWsaa	I don't like my parents because they've picked my brother as the favorite child, and treat me like a lost cause. I'm not just saying that, because they give him the school trips to Florida and to New York, and I have to stay home because "he has a future."|`|3WCXGRaGaa	its cuz most teens dont think there mom's and dad's believe them.. i know my friend does and i see nothing wrong with her house, she usally is the one fighting first, but still i have no idea what htey say back and forth.

cZgMiF9maa	Student loans are meant to help students who are unable to bear their educational expenses. Student loans are different in different countries in the way they are devised, but then the common types of student loans available are the undergraduate loans, college student loans, private student loans and federal family educational loans. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-loans.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-lo...</a><br>  <br>  Student loan repayments are not made until the student completes his graduation. This facility helps him to concentrate on his studies and earn some little amount of money while he is studying, but repayment has to start once he finishes his education.

9x8ryDv6aa	Apologize to her for losing her dvd. Explain to her that although you did this, it does not make it right for her to break your expensive picture frame. Offer to buy her a new iron man dvd if it'd make her happy. Say something as simple as this is not worth risking your friendship over.|`|sduv9y7yaa	buy her a new iron man dvd and say i'm so sorry hopefully she will appreciate it a lot and maybe do something about your picture
3H9k7tN5aa	You're looking at a veteran in these situations man. It's rough ya know. I know your heart is broken, but over time you WILL get over it. Just agree with her. Unfortunately, you will have to lie and tell her you are over her. Because if you don't you could go days without talking to her because she is going to be a little freaked out.  Who knows? Overtime you may get together. Who knows what the future may hold.<br>  <br>  Some people say go out and see other people. It may work for some, but in my situation it didn't help at all. I would at least try it, just to see if it helps. Other than that, it's going to be hard. Nothing anyone can really say to help, other than just time. <br>  <br>  The most difficult part in these situations is that you don't want to lose them as a friend, which can happen. So just play it safe, and weight out your options. Over time you will know what you can do, and not do. And if she stops being your friend, she wasn't a friend to begin with.|`|2U43CaBBaa	she doesnt like you more than a friend. if u do anything now, it might mess up yall's relationship, so just stay the best of friends that you are and time will change everything. just be patient. <br>  good luck (:|`|vpmRRamKaa	i dont think you should ask her out, but your situation is like that movie on disney channel called "minutemen" you should check it out, but like dont ask her out, because if you ever wanna break up with her you guys may never be friends again, and we never wanna loose friends in our lifetime just gain them,|`|KcAehrrKaa	She could be testing your feelings to see if they're real or not, goodluck.|`|4e9a63209954f9c19fc65c6882ece7f4aa	she clearly said in the text she needs you <br>  talk to her|`|itluhGrnaa	i think you stuck in the friendship zone...<br>  but dont loose this friendship..|`|1l7bK325aa	shes right when she texted you <br>  "You are a fantastic guy and i care about you alot i would totally go to sadies with you BUT i think i need a consistent guy friend like you in my life." <br>  sounds like shes counting on you to be a good guy friend<br>  and sounds like shes not actually interested<br>  i learned from ppl to not date best friends or your best friends girlfriends or boyfriends<br>  because once its over it doeen'st feel the same again|`|dL6BcJQxaa	WOW!!

My problem was solved after i had recieved this info from a friend and now me and my girlfriend are dating. I would sugest that you stay strong and be there for her in her times of need and just show her(not with words) that she can rely on you. Oh and one more thing, there is one downside, dont be to pushy on the dating subject. Let her see that even though you were turned down, that wont stop you from being friends. After seeing that your still her friend, her bond for you will grow. Good luck chris.|`|NzoKZhgFaa	hi! So u know sometin dude i have the same freakin problem!!!! Ive been best friends with a guy named jess for 2 years and i love him do death. As a brother and more.  And the thing is he knows i like him and i know he likes me.  But he wants the same thing... just to stay friends cause he doesnt wanna ruin our friendship.  So my answer to the question would have to be just keep being her best friend.  If you like her go with that feeling.  And sooner or later your time is gonna come wen she realizes that she cant live without u in her life.|`|P7HdSzhKaa	i went through the same thing..<br>  <br>  i told a my best friend who was a girl that i loved her in high school. <br>  <br>  i wanted to ask her to the prom, but she never responded to when i said i loved her.<br>  <br>  i was deeply depressed, but i asked someone else.<br>  <br>  i am still her friend. still love her. <br>  <br>  if she wants you to stay constant in her life, that means you will be like her rock to lean on.<br>  <br>  you see her in every situation and eventually she will love you too for that.<br>  <br>  i suggest that you just ask someone else to the dance, but hang with her and her date later like bowling or something afterwards.<br>  <br>  i did that. your friend just wants you to be with her a long time and if it means being friends for now then so be it.|`|UEbqy7lUaa	DUDE i have the same dilemma. My best friend is amazing, and we've been friends for over three years. She's perfect in almost every way, and whenever we talk on the phone, text, or whatever, it just seems like it clicks. but she lives two states away, so its hard to keep a relationship. I keep hinting the question of if she likes me or not, and usually its a no. it crushes me, and i feel like crap. basically, i just keep trying to be the best friend i can to her, and hope for the best. <br>  <br>  so for your situation, i would suggest just keeping on with her, just dont be too clingy man, or else that will push her away. just be yourself, keep in touch, and remember: at least she's near you.<br>  <br>  1)dont give up<br>  2)dont be clingy<br>  3)be yourself<br>  and it'll end up fine.|`|iJeGjRTTaa	You can't make people like you! I'm sorry, that's just how it is!!! <br>  <br>  If you really, REALLY love this person--think about her good qualities, think about her bad qualities. If you still like her, then find out this guy's faults! Show her that YOU are better than him and listen to her tone of voice when she talks about this guy. Be consistent and show her all your good points. If she still doesn't like you she doesn't know the chance she missed and she's probably not the one for you.<br>  <br>  Remember there's other people out there you haven't met.|`|kPl1SJ1Aaa	Okay, some of the BEST relationships start with friendship first.<br>  <br>  Make your case to her... your friendship is the reason you SHOULD be dating, not the reason you should not be.<br>  <br>  Plus, if you give it a try and things dont work out, you CAN return to friends with a strong foundation first.<br>  <br>  Honey, here is a twist -- she doesnt want to date you because you are such good friends... but she is asking you to be untrue to yourself by only being her friend when you LOVE her and it HURTS you to see her going to the dance with someone else.<br>  <br>  So, the twist is -- you may not be able to be such good friends because you want to date her... you and I both know that you will take what you can get, so if friends is it, you'll suffer through.<br>  <br>  But, it cant hurt to gently let her see that you are not a sure thing, that "always there" guy that she depends on may move on if his heart is broken.<br>  <br>  She is asking A LOT of you to keep being her friend, while she asks other guys to the dance. <br>  <br>  If she truly doesnt have the right feelings to date you, tell her to simply SAY SO. You, my dear, are better off knowing the truth, so you can decide where to go from there.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
ECe1rgsdaa	I did!!! We were on vacation in Maine and we went for a walk on the beach at night, just as the moon was rising. We decided to sit for a minute and he asked me!! It was extra special because it was a beach where we both had gone on vacation when we were children, before we knew each other.I was so surprised!! It was totally unexpected and I will remember it forever!|`|l43NSgHyaa	I agree, it's very romantic and I would love for my proposal to be like that.   I did know a couple who got engaged on the beach, from what I hear, it was really beautiful.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	kind of. my new husband took me up north. we live in Michigan  we drove up to Silver Lake and had a picnic he brought the portable grill and cooked a nice lunch. then we drove up to a town called Frankfort.  we walked out to lake Michigan then we walked out onto the pier. we were the only ones on the pier and that is where he asked me to marry him. I had a fantastic view over Lake Michigan. Oh Yeah there was a wedding being set up on the beach when we left the wedding party was showing up.|`|znq808AKaa	When my h2b proposed it was a BIG surprise! But I get chills even a year later when I tell the story.<br>  My fiancee and I lived 2000km apart from each other when we met. So we used flights each month to see each other. After two years he got a job this side and moved here. The day he arrived, I waited for him at the airport....then a man walked up to me and gave me a red rose...I was like "what?!....then another guy with another single red rose and a lady with another....till all the passengers got of the plane...last but not least my fiancee got off...with a single WHITE rose in his hand...went down on his knee and proposed....<br>  I hope this inspires you guys out there to do something unique and special for that lucky lady! Good luck and enjoy every second!<br>  I wouldn't trade it even for the most romantic beach setting ever!|`|n5NDs9JAaa	Well you are setting yourself up for failure for several reasons:<br>  1.) Guys don't (99% of the time) do what we secretly plan in our heads. which leads us to...<br>  2.) If you do tell him this fantasy you have, and he takes you to the beach, you will either know what's to come, or...<br>  3.) You will be disappointed when every time you go to the beach (if you live nearby one) and he doesn't propose.<br>  <br>  Just let it happen naturally! I am sure however which way you are proposed to will be beautiful. All you have to tell him is that you'd like a meaningful proposal and he will understand.|`|yrzpCh2Xaa	hey that would be real nice! I recently got engaged to my fiancee when we traveled to paris, corny i know but I don't care ha ha|`|6AYA3GWWaa	Personally, I find beach weddings & beach proposals a bit cliche, but:<br>  a) I am the least romantic person alive, <br>  and b) my fiance happened to propose on a beach.  <br>  <br>  We were vacationing in New England.  We couldn't get to any of the scenic points he'd picked out as "good proposal spots," so he just asked me while we were looking out over the water.  Unfortunately for him, we were on the rocky end of the shore, so he got a bit of a surprise when he tried to kneel down. ;-)<br>  <br>  Always make for the sandy part of the beach!|`|xkB4AiuAaa	A think a beach proposal would be incredibly romantic too! Drop a few hints and hopefully your guy will pick up on them!<br>  <br>  I got my perfect proposal in December last year, My fiance and I were in Canada visiting his family. I have always had a thing for Snow, and all that comes with it,I just find it so magical, being from Western Australia needless to say that I had never seen snow.<br>  So while we were in Canada we went for a ride in a horse drawn carriage and he handed me a love heart shaped snowball with my engagement ring inside - instead of the traditional ring box! <br>  After our horse drawn carriage ride we spent the day doing snow activities, ice skating, snow angles, building a snow man etc.<br>  I couldn't have imagined the proposal to be anymore perfect!
K2QwEM4raa	Yes he is if not now then he will be very soon and then you will want someone closer to your age. This very rallyly works out. Stop now before their are children involved.|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	yuck, that's gross.<br>  What if he has kids that are just a few years younger than you?<br>  But, I mean that's just my opinion, if it's really love, then love is blind. I s'posse age doesn't matter. Neither of you will even see it if you're really in love.|`|tEy9hvebaa	if you have fun together who cares.<br>  <br>  and he's probably a better lover too|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, that's a little old. Its like you being 13 and trying to date somebody who was just born. No thanks.
K2QwEM4raa	He is using you,don't let him.|`|DV39yHz4aa	do u think that he likes u? maybe he dows, maybe he doesn't. if u like him u should really start talking to him, do watever u can to get the word out that u still have feelings for him.
iOpzTvSpaa	he likes you, the thing is he's just a guy who's embarrassed to get rejected even though he knows he won't (we guys are weird that way, don't ask) so just initiate the first move and let him get the idea, go hold his hand or even ask him out|`|x9FienLUaa	he is not telling the truth - c'mon what guy is going to admit that when challenged by a bro.|`|RbHQjbpbaa	Yea He Likes You.

J6Ksn0P7aa	You have to tell your husband how you are feeling, make sure he knows how much you appreciate how he provides for the family, but you are feeling a little abandoned.  Ask him if there is a way that he did not have to work as late.  He will, I'm sure chose you over the late hours at the office.|`|43CAj5M8aa	I would suggest you talk to him about your feelings. Maybe he doesn't know how you feel. Go to counseling if he will agree to it. You had to feel something for him sometime or you wouldn't have married him. Try to remember that feeling and communicate with him and see if you can get back to that place with him. So many couples don't stay together anymore. It's so easy to get a divorce. A marriage is a lot of hard work. Your kids need a stable, structured family. Tell him your kids need him to be there more. We're supposed to work to live and not live to work. If you talk to him and he isn't willing to change and is not willing to go to marriage counseling, then make your decision. Give it a fair chance before you make a decision.|`|XxhenzC0aa	you are going to just have to flat out ask if his job is more important than your marriage.  And staying together for the kids only hurts them in the long run trust me.  They maybe young but they can still sense when you're unhappy.  But dont cheat.  Be woman enough to divorce before taking that big of a step.  One step at a time|`|8i46CxZ0aa	Talk to him first about your concerns, if you have not already. More than likely he will not change his routine. Might want to seek out professional help to be a neutral ground and mediator to get both ideas out in the open. <br>  <br>  I don't think you are being selfish...the kids will learn to accept as they are still young enough to adapt. Once tey are teenagers it will become much harder, as they will be able to think and analyze more about your relationship. <br>  <br>  Are you willing to put up with this for the rest of your life? Obviously you have doubt and it is painful for you. Let yourself be happy..let your husband be happy. YOU  DON'T LIVE FOREVER. It may get complicated at times...but if it hurts...mend it and move on.|`|AA10994431	Who wants an unhappy mom??? Have you discussed your feeling's with him? That's the first thing to do. If you can't compromise to make you both satisfied than maybe divorce is the option. If you can compromise make sure your needs are satisfied and his also don't' forget about the needs of your children who need attention and love. I'm sure he feels wrong about the situation too. You know since the 50's the man makes the money and that's make the man. Times are changing and alot of women would rather have the man than the money. You guys need to talk and see if you both want to work this out. Leave the kids out of it as the reason to be unhappy and keep moving thru the motions. The kids need positive attention from both of you. My parents stayed together when they should of separated and all of us was miserable. That's only because they was not willing to work on the issues. Of all, Love is the second greatest gift of God (Jesus being the first). So talk it  through and hopefully resolve it so both are feeling satisfied. Don't forget a plan to shower your children with positive attention so their need are met. If neither of you can talk it out go to counseling than if that isn't working than maybe divorce is what has to happen. But don't consider until you've exhausted all options. Your not the only one missing out on daddy your kids are too. He needs to realize that your not the only one he needs to be around for. Ya money is good but never lasts for long. Time is worth more than anything!|`|dba5a253c515fc71f0776ad817729400aa	Talk to him, does he want a better marriage with you. He probably does.  You both need more from the other. Your marriage can be renewed!! Pray for him, I pray for my husband daily and it's changed our lives. Do you go to church? I think you need christian counseling. My husband and I marrried right out of High School we both had affairs but don't believe in divorice, we made it and we're so happy together.<br>  I bet he wants a change too, not a different wife, but a refreshed marriage.
b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	Okay - clearly she doesn't care.<br>  <br>  You call her and tell her that you realize that asking someone to be a bridesmaid is asking a lot, and that she is right, that she should do what is right for her.  <br>  <br>  Tell her that really, the rehearsal is not negotiable and that is why you are giving so much notice, and that you are glad that she realized her schedule conflict now rather than later.  Tell her you don't want her to feel stressed over this, so you would understand if she chose to step down.  <br>  <br>  Basically you are telling her to choose to step down or be at the rehearsal - only you are trying to make it sound like you are doing her a favor and that you are the "good guy" here.<br>  <br>  ADD: and usually I say if it is his family, let him handle it - but in this case that fact that she is YOUR bridesmaid trumps that.  Just try not to burn family bridges in the process.|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	Give her a choice.<br>  Tell her that you can see that she doesn't have much enthusiasm and if she isn't able to fulfil the obligations of a bridesmaid, you must respectfully ask her not to be part of the wedding party. If she wants to participate, tell her there are certain things that she has to do. She can't just show up on the big day.<br>  <br>  You never know, she may actually be hoping that you'll ask her to pull out! She's only half-hearted about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  .|`|j1k8qGd6aa	I would ask her to step down and explain to her that you're doing it for both of you. You don't want to get in the way of her regular plans since this is not the most important day in her life and you would want some one fully committed that day to making sure your plans go off as smoothly as possible. Make sure you ask your fiance and discuss it with him and let him understand how upset and stressed she is make you feel. Also have him join you when you discuss it with her. Good luck!|`|n68tCJ7zaa	i would definitely ask her to step down, although i would try to do it very cordially<br>  a wedding is no time to make enemies in the family<br>  just politely say "i really respect you and your committment to work, and i really hope your engagement works in your favor. however, this rehearsal is essential to the wedding, and i'm afraid i'll have to ask you to step down if you cannot attend"<br>  <br>  that's all you say. very nice, very calm and very justified. it isn't rude of you to ask this, and it isn't rude of you to ask. if she cares, then she will make adjustments to attend. and if she doesn't, then she'll probably be just as relieved as you.|`|qfUjyUDTaa	Tell your fiance you cant take any more of her crap and replace her with someone who does care about you and your wedding day.<br>  <br>  Poor form on her part - she shouldnt have agreed to be in the wedding party to begin with!!|`|crxbob5jaa	I'm assuming she is in the wedding because of your fiance and not because of you. You let him decide what to do, and you respect his decision.|`|YzhZCs3Naa	I third that! <br>  <br>  If she's like that then she doesn't deserve the privilege of being there. There's no reason for her to act that way.|`|arDVgzgqaa	I agree -- she doesn't deserve to be there. Tell her so.<br>  <br>  And don't feel badly about it; she brought it upon herself. =)|`|JoX8D638aa	I think you said the most important thing yourself; it's YOUR day and you deserve respect and a little bit of cooperation in the least. In my opinion, I think you should bite the bullet and ask her if she really wants to be in the bridal party. If she answers yes, then you tell her that she needs to be more involved in the preparations because she's beginning to waste you and your fiance's time.<br>  Contrastingly, if she says no, you know what you have to do!<br>  <br>  If you do this, you're giving her a choice but also showing her that you're serious about this.<br>  <br>  I have to say that if this was myself, I would immediately ask her to step down, but I know that it must be difficult considering she is your fiance's cousin. Ask her whether she actually wants to do it first, but if she says 'yes' and continues to cause problems, get rid of her!<br>  <br>  Congrats on your upcoming wedding, by the way.|`|MTcFC9ccaa	The fact that you had to ask this question shows you know the answer.  Your wedding day is about what you want and you have enough other things to be considering other than if your bridesmaid is going to show up and know whats going on.  Its your day.  You need to make a command decision.  Tell your fiance she is out and he can either break it to her gently or you can break it to her hard..  No need to explain why, everyone will know why and your cousin will probably be relieved because it doesn't sound like she wants to be in it anyway. The only one agonizing over this is you.  I guarantee she isn't laying in bed at night worring about being cut from the wedding party or if she's in it where she'll stand.  Most likely the oposite, wishing she didn't have to be in it.  Do her a favor.  Do yourself a favor.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	She definitely does not want to be in your wedding so of course you will let her know that you are releasing her from this. If she cannot make it to the rehearsal, she will be no good to your wedding.  The sooner you do this, the happier you will be. She is taking all of your job in planning your wedding away.  Tell her you still hope she will attend but that she is being released of her responsibilities. Do it nicely and there should not be family problems. (Of course, there may be depending on how petty they are.) I wish you the best.|`|f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	You need to have a heart to heart talk with the cousin.  And although you are stressed to the max about your wedding try, for the sake of future family relations, to see where she is coming from.  This is a time in your life when you will gain more by being the peace maker than bridezilla.<br>  <br>  You need to set aside some time to meet with her on neutral ground and discuss the wedding.  Please remain calm during the discussion.  <br>  <br>  Here is what I think is happening here:<br>  1. She committed before she fully considered the obligation. <br>  2. She may feel out of place in the wedding party if all the other bridesmaids are your close friends.  <br>  3. She is not Greek and is now afraid of what she doesn't know & doesn't want to look foolish or admit her fear.<br>  4. She is now fretting over & comparing her own romantic relationship situation.<br>  <br>  Remain calm and reassuring during your discussion with her. You have several months to help her be confident with the other bridesmaids & the process.  You may even gain a great friend if you extend yourself here. <br>  <br>  Don't discount the fact that there may be other issues in her life that are troubling her.  She may be sad about her romantic relationship.  Nothing brings issues to the surface like a wedding, LOL. There can be lots of stuff just under the surface.  LISTEN to what she says.<br>  <br>  Balance your conversation with how much you had wanted to share this important time in your life with her.  How you are so grateful/happy/blessed to be joining her family.  How much you want to share your culture with her, etc.  Be sure to include how important your wedding is to you and though it is unrealistic to expect perfection, you sure want everything to run smooth.  DO NOT say that your wedding has to be perfect.  DO NOT tell her that she is ruining your wedding.  That will just put too much pressure on someone that doesn't know you very well.<br>  <br>  Try and give her an easy way out of this obligation if she is still fearful or reluctant.  Offer to reimburse her for her dress, shoes, whatever. Offer her other duties in the wedding. Do not force her to step down.  This will cause lots of family problems & get things going in a bad direction.  <br>  <br>  Your wedding is one day, hopefully your marriage will last for the rest of your life.  Try to see this as an opportunity to further your relationship with your new family.  <br>  <br>  If it was easy everyone would do it, right?|`|vyL7yEleaa	i agree with the post above mine, you need to tell her straight up, explain to her this may not be the most important day for her but it is for you and you asked her to be apart of it, if she doesn't want to help and participate kick her to the curb. <br>  <br>  you don't want that added stress to an already stressful day. i'm sure not having her in the party will be a much needed release and i would talk it over with your other half and your other bridesmaids see what they say.|`|VPCVswkpaa	i apologize for this but u say ***** go **** urself its ur day and ur din her a favor i would even allow her at my reception|`|LDe9yzCKaa	just tell her straight up... she obviously didnt give a crap when it came 2 ur feelings... she didnt care that this is an important day in ur life and in ur fiance's. find someone responsible to replace her and say byebye to her. ur wedding is too important to take any risks. besides... she cant complain about it... she's the one who said no in the 1st place
hwsrZNcaaa	wow i had the same situation before! xD<br>  that guy you liked for 8 months he doesnt like you like you how like him the fact that you guys didnt talk at all kindah say it and if he liked you he wouldve dated you andthe whole jacket thing to be honest i think its kinda wierd to give a guy a jacket if you arent dating {sorry if it sounds kinda harsh}<br>   <br>  try to give that other a shot he seems much better than the first guy he talked to you when that other guy was being a total douchebag xD
bSkYYRrEaa	Meet some people that didn't go to your middle school, start hanging out with them. When they get to know you, see if you're interested in any of the new girls that you've met.

J6Ksn0P7aa	Why not, it seems like you have a pretty good relationship already.  Make sure you ask her out directly and make sure she understands it is as a date.   Buy her some flowers and ask her, and there will be no confusion.  I am concerned about the hitting questions though, she may have some domestic abuse in her situation and need a really safe relationship, even if that means being friends for a while.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	ask her out already!|`|SEjzMD0Caa	Sounds like she likes you too and you should take a chance and ask her out.

I can not justify her actions, but she is learning to flirt, and learning what is socially acceptable in the dating scheme.  Perhaps she has some domestic issues that are holding her back. offer her an ear, and a shoulder to lean on, but be sincere. If you don't really care, don't bother. Do not lay false intentions if you are not interested. Only you know if you should ask her out. If you think you might have feelings for her then by all means do it. but don't ask her out only because she polks you and flirts a little. Be honest to her, and get to know her. do not rush things. maybe an unofficial date is what you and her need. something like a walk through the park, or a study date at the library. most importantly , make her feel comfortable and you should feel the same..|`|GU8p5WEoaa	she sounds super annoying, no offense dude. that is confusing, but she definitely does like you. ask a friend to ask her out for you.do so only if you think you will be happy together. if shes just some dumb a$$ hottie w/ a little body, think about it first.|`|Ilq7WEM5aa	She's proba bly just scared of being rejected by you, that's why everytime she asks she says she's joking.<br>  So yeah i think you should make the move and ask her out, it seems like she really likes you<br>  Good luck x|`|lQ4wv1gIaa	DEFINATELY!<br>  are u blind lol she is basically just asking you out right there and chickening out i have done that before.. and she will take it well she seems like a girl that would,... go for it :D|`|dXEo2xpqaa	Yes!

I do not see anyway for you to get custody back with out an attorney and court.<br>  <br>  Good luck
FwA0DYyAaa	i wouldn't get with her it make friend ship over all the time! trust me!|`|J30Gh5O6aa	thats really wrong dude. have u heard of guy code?? i know it and im a chick! you DONT date xes u dont date gfs!!!! its that simple find someone else thats so messed up.|`|j76UvzTXaa	It depends who you really love more. How long have you and your best friend been together? How long have your friend and gf been together? Girlfriends last a long time, but best friends last FOREVER!!!!!!!!!|`|q3UiNyDdaa	Just because he doesn't want her to flirt doesn't mean he is abusive, but I don't know the situation or what he does, so I won't really talk about that.<br>  <br>  The first thing you should do is figure out what you would want in the relationship, such as how long you want it and if you want it to be deep or shallow, and determine whether the relationship would be what you want it to be. Think about what you know about her other relationships, especially her current one, and see if she has been in the kinds of relationships that you want to be in. Chances are, she will be the same with you as she has been with the others. Especially keep in mind that she likes to flirt.<br>  <br>  Next, think about how your friend would react if he walked in on you cheating with her. I'm not saying that you are, but he sounds like a jealous guy, so if she leaves him for you, that is probably how he will see it, even if it isn't like that.<br>  <br>  The last thing for you to do is to weigh the last two paragraphs. Weigh how good your relationship would be, and how your friend would react. The only thing left to do is pick whichever option seems best to you after that.
NBo2ucWsaa	Ignore him. Literally, when he talks, ignore everything he says. Don't even bother with him anymore. It works.|`|8LfW9tBxaa	tell him how you feel.<br>  it may make you feel a little bit better<br>  if he doesnt do anything than hes screwed and distrubing to you.<br>  :'(|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Really do nothing. if he doing soemthing that pisses you off, dont listen to him. use self controle. im also the oldest in my family. im 17 throw nad im a girl.. but realy dont listen that the most you cant do... just let him be his punk *** self adn how knows.. he might smarter up in time... ^^ i hope i helped!|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	there is nothing you can do...  what i find amazing is that your parents are allowing such behavior.  they are the ones at fault here!!!

eAx9wk1zaa	im in the same situation, im going to ask her myself whats goin on between them and c how she responds and that way u can actually see how she feels. than u know if u shood step in or not|`|fTjG1KGLaa	try to spend as much time as you can with her but dont suffacate her! space it out, if u know what i mean. then when the day will come SOON ENOUGH when you can sense shes into you then just kiss her lol. trust me, it always works ;]|`|x9FienLUaa	keep spending time with her-eventually  she will realize that her b/f is not around as much and her attention will turn.|`|iOpzTvSpaa	Depends on you and who she is dating, if he doesn't seem that hot headed or you're bigger than him you could flat out ask her out and just forget about him but that usually never works, more likely you should spend as much time with her as possible and see if he (her boyfriend) starts to get nervous, this will mean he thinks you have a shot which means you probably do have a shot|`|wRHsNqz0aa	Pursuing her at this point will definitely break your heart in the future. I was in the same situation as you. I was too slow and now the girl i onced liked so much is going with a d-bag and I was literally shocked when i saw them holding hands and walking down the school hallway. I remember feeling like my chest has been stabbed with an ice pick dipped in acid (It felt like crap). My advice personally is to find another girl. How would you feel if your girlfriend is flirting with another guy? Respect them both and You could be happier with another girl. Good Luck!
b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	He feels threatened by you and rightly so after all you are much younger then he. If nothing is going on and your not sexually attracted to her then why let him get to you. Try to put yourself in his shoes would you put up with it or would you try and scare the younger guy off.I think you need to find another friend preferably someone who isn't married that's how you over come this fear.|`|lyWSufFBaa	Well the simple fact you are not a "kept secret" goes to show she isn't interested in you in that way and her husband doesn't seem to be insecure.  He may  just be joking around.  The man even invited you to his house so he definitely doesn't seem threatened.  If the situation is uncomfortable, you can always end the friendship.  If not, talk to him.  Let him know that his jokes make you uncomfortable because there is nothing going on and you just want to make sure he knows.|`|PBdPD748aa	well there IS a reason for these comments and 'jokes' do you think she could have feelings for you and has led her husband to believe so. you really need to discuss this with him, because, as i am assuming you are NOT a wife stealer, and have no interest for her in that way. you need to either give him a call beforehand or organise to see him. you need to be straight with him and your intentions and clear the air, because it sounds like there are more issues going on then you are aware of. DONT put up with it, confront it, that is the only way you are going to be able to move forward. do it now!|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	This is an uncomfortable situation, no doubt about it.  Obviously, her husband is in tune with her and what's happening, and might be defending his turf or he might be semi-abusive anyway.  My wife had a platonic friend many years ago, and despite her insistence that he was platonic and nothing would happen, it did finally turn into an affair.  Just be careful...decide how far you want this to go, then maybe back off a bit...?|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Duh, stop hanging around with the woman!  You may feel uncomfortable because subconsciously there might be more between you than you are willing to admit.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	If your conscience is clear, there's nothing to overcome. A guy shopping with a married woman IS kinda odd, unless you're gay.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	He is trying to be accomodating to the friendship while getting his point across at the same time.....and you nor his wife seem to be catching a clue.  He doesn't want to sound like his wife's "daddy" instead of her husband and say yall can't be friends, but at the same time, he's not comfortable with the friendship.  I have to admit that I don't blame him.  My husband would never tolerate that type of behavior from me and he shouldn't.  What may be friendship now is bound to evolve into something else with enough time and companionship.  She is asking for trouble in her marriage and if you care for her that much as a friend you will choose not to spend "alone" time with her.  It's not appropriate for her to hang with you like one of her girlfriends. This is a recipe for disaster.  Don't go shopping with her.|`|yOHCXiaMaa	Yep.. sit down with him when he says these things and tell him that while you are willing to help your friend...she is just that A friend and nothing more and you would appreciate that he sees it that way too.  You are not there to step between them or take his place.  It will pretty much end the teasing.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Hey sit a talk with her husband. Get a feel on his feelings. Let him know your a bit uncomfortable with his remarks. If he feels threatened by you then maybe you need to be not so close to his wife, or make sure wifey isn't giving her husband a reason to be cocky.|`|B24KqmgGaa	I think he trusts his wife but somewhere in the back of his mind a little devil is telling him that you are a man.  He is probably wondering what your motives are.  Maybe he wants to scare you off or maybe he wants to get to know you better.|`|rGStRem1aa	whoa!  sounds like you're a prospective third in this party!  always go with your gut.  cancel the date if you're uncomfortable.  i'm more than half expecting them to answer the door naked.  be prepared!|`|Hgd9Ln0Zaa	Stop messing around with a married woman.|`|AJUeAPrVaa	It sounds like her feelings and yours are more than just friends. Be careful.|`|EY2ixfZzaa	what is this man name David....lol.. stay away from someone man tell him to stay away! fear you better be scared! you should never mess with a friends husband!

cdt4F6ZWaa	When I was around your age, I had a guy tell me the exact same thing.  And you know what? I'm long married to someone else, and I hear he's still single.  It's a good thing that your boyfriend is as honest as he is, if he tells you he wants to play the field, and he wonders about sex with another girl.  Most guys would not come out and say it. But this is, in fact, exactly what he wants. You are both very young and most anyone can predict that if you've been seeing each other since you were 15 or 16, chances are the guy will want to have sex with someone else, at some point.  <br>  <br>  Although it's not easy to call it quits, it really is the only thing for you to do, and I am sorry to say that.  But the fact is, he's going to get out there and party and find other girls who are totally willing.  When he tells you that he will have sex with them, but sleep with you, I think he's trying to say that it doesn't matter, or that it won't be anything "serious".  To him, sleeping with you is more of an emotional thing, or more of a commitment.  I'm sure he means well, but it's just not working here.  <br>  <br>  You are right when you say you just can't sit back while he plays the field.  And you shouldn't.  This will be tough for you but, now you have to get out there too, and start dating other guys.  It is hard to say if this guy will be the one you will marry...some people do end up with their high school sweethearts, and others realize that they are way too young to decide on who they will marry.  But definitely do not "wait" for him!!  You'll see....there WILL be other great guys out there!!|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Youre both still young yet and college time is when most people get ll their playing around over with so they can get serious after college. This may be what he wants to do and chances are he will do whether you agree or not, then he will never have any regrets or wondrs after college. College is when most people grow up to be adults maing stupid mistakes along the way. You may not have a choice here if you dont want to chase him away. I dont agree with it either but this is college life and what is, is!  Alsoyou right on the sex part. Good luck|`|Hgd9Ln0Zaa	Write the relationship off and have fun in your freshman year.  It sounds like he has dumped you, so enjoy yourself.  Go out with some girlfriends and such.  Perhaps when you feel ready try dating again.  He sounds like he wants his cake and eat it too.  Don't wait around while he has fun.|`|CGFAPKJOaa	Hey. Before he stepped into this long-term relationship, he should have cashed in his player card.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, with young couples, this often seems to be the case, especially when involving college.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to grant his wishes, because if you do not, the chance of you being cheated on will rocket sky high by this coming fall.<br>  <br>  To help you cope, while he's doing his thing, you do yours. Have as much fun as you can in college, and when he comes back to you, you'll know if you really want it or not.<br>  <br>  *Also, when you're in love, you want ONLY one person. The opposite sex ceases to appeal to you in a romantic way. Although, we all do have or thoughts, we don't act on it unless pushed.<br>  <br>  I believe he meant you are the only girl he will make love. Sex is a completely different act. No emotions are involved. Either way, you've got to slowly let yourself go. It won't hurt to be flirty with other guys in the process....|`|EY2ixfZzaa	you know then he is not the boy for you, Enjoy life, marriage is not what it made out to be... so before you even think of the guy to marry enjoy your life!!! he not worth the wait and he not even worth the rest of the year! let him go now, let him know what he lost out on... enjoy your last year of HS FREE!!! Don't let him tell you he wants to be free during college tell him you want to be free now! he not even worth it at all! If he loved you he would not even think about other girls so don't let a guy control your mind because if you do you will give him everything!|`|yOHCXiaMaa	Hon..you both are 18.  You both have seen no one but each other.  Cripes.. havent you ever wondered about other guys?  What you should do is become just friends... no sex.  Tell him that since he wants to experience other girls that it would be unfair to make you sit back and wait..so you've decided that it would be better to be Just friends.<br>  <br>  If the boy/man loves you he will change his mind about seeing others.  If not...its a big world out there.  This is the time to learn about you.  See your options.  So take a deep breath and get on with life.  I wouldn't want to sit around and drive myself crazy thinking about what he's doing.. let him wonder what I'm doing!|`|J7Tvn78jaa	You are both so young.  I think it would be a good idea for you both to date other people for a while in college.  You may both date other people and realize you are both perfect for each other and live a very happy life.  You may find another man who is everything you never knew you needed and realize it was't meant to be with your current boyfriend.  But, its better to know whats out there than for either of you to "wonder".|`|s1pC35Seaa	Tell him if he ever has sex with another girl its over. He can't just do that crap and expect for you to take him back, you're right. Just tell him blatantly and flat out that you will leave him if he does that. That should scare him into not wanting to do it, and if he does it, then he doesn't really love you so its better off that way.|`|UrE9xvliaa	A friend of mine is going through the exact same thing..So I'm gonna tell u what I told her(she is also 18..i am 26 3kids married for 8 years) It is completely natural for him to want to play the field..but it is unfair to u..based on what i have experienced men look at sex totally different then women..for (most) women sex is a very emotional thing..well as for men it is mostly physical..men can have sex with a woman and not have any emotional connections afterword...its good that he is being honest with u and obviously doesnt want to cheat on u..but he isn't putting any consideration toward ur feelings..u are both going to attend the same college..so u will probably see or hear about what hes doing and with who..and since u are not comfortable with the situation it will probably hurt u..honestly u need to let him go with no strings attatched..let him do what he wants to do but u do the same..date other guys have fun..but dont spend ur time worrying about him or waiting for him..if u guys are meant to be together it will be..who knows u may find someone better...i really dont think that he deserves u..good luck sweetie.. :)|`|WvUo4fi8aa	Your boyfriend is keeping you as a fall safe option i.e. if he doesn't find anyone finally he will come back to you. Saying you are the only one doesn't convey you are the only one. Physical aspect of a relationship is very important and one has to be honest in that. You cannot love someone and sleep with someone. That is not true love. <br>  <br>  The fact that these thoughts are coming to his mind, indicates clearly that he is not serious about you. If I were in your place, I would have left him. Let him go and explore the field. You were also a kind of exploration too for him..sorry to say that. Don't waste your time over this guy...you go ahead and explore your field.<br>  <br>  Besides, both of you are pretty young to get serious about marriage. Guys take longer time to think maturely compared to girls. They tend to get involved in serious relationships that ends in marriage mostly in their mid 20s. Right now, both of you will see and meet different kind of people, who knows you may end-up finding someone more interesting before he does. <br>  <br>  Sex, is not everything in a relationship, the understanding is important that develops with age and experience in life.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	if he's wondering what it feels like to have sex with other woman then he's not truly in love with you. instead you are a constant person in his life and when he's not able to have another girlfriend or find a woman to have sex he'll call you. he's not in love with you, if he was you would be plenty enough woman for him and he wouldnt care what other girl's sex is like because he would know he was getting it good where he was. break up with him and don't go back to him when he's done playing the field
80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	He will not move on as long as he can threaten and get his way.  Problem is, if you stand up to him, he may become physically violent.  And in the meantime, you cannot move on with your life.<br>  <br>  Things could be slightly easier if you were renting a place instead of owning.  I would suggest you go to a shelter for women suffering abuse - and ask them to direct you to some local help.  <br>  <br>  At this point, going to the police probably would not help things - only make it worse.  And a lawyer, is expensive and may not be fully qualified to help you (My wife used to work for one, who came into the office and slept while she did all the paperwork.  He even sent her to court instead of going himself).  But if the people at the shelter recommends an attorney, you can bet that attorney is reasonably good at handling that type of case.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest when you go seeking help in your area - be careful so your ex-boyfriend will not find out.  That includes giving them a phone number where they can reach you - and even not giving them your email address in case your ex-boyfriend reads your emails.  Posting at Yahoo Answers should be okay because he would have to have the login & password to get in.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest you not say or do anything around your 4 year old son.  He's just old enough to say something to your ex-boyfriend like "Mom talking to the policeman".<br>  <br>  Back around 2000, when I worked in public safety there was a monitoring device that could be given to someone who had a restraining order - and a similar device given to the person in protective custory.  If he then came within a certain distance of you - say - 2 blocks - then you would be notified by that device so you could go to a safe place.  And at the same time, the police would be notified so the police could go met him.  But there were liability concerns - what happened if he took the device off?  What happened if the police dd not get there in time?  I retired from public safety and have not heard anymore about the device.  but it does show there was an interest in having something better than a "on your honor" protective order.<br>  <br>  If you take steps to get him out - you might have your son suddenly stay overnight at a friend house - so your son is out of the way when the ex-boyfriend is removed.  And don't forget to change the phone number and the locks on the door (and windows?).  Add a deadbolt to any door.  If the doors have  windows in them, maybe try to replace the doors with a solid door.  Expensive, but its good protection.  If you add a deadbolt - make sure they use a 4 inch or longer screw and screw the deadbolt thru the doorfame and into the stud located behind it.  Otherwise, a good kick against the door - may rip the deadbolt out of the door frame.  <br>  <br>  You might also consider buying a spray can of mace or pepper spray.  Saw it work when I was in high school.  A bully picked on a kid in class everyday for almost a year.  The teacher never got involved and never said anything to the bully.  One day, when the bully started badmouthing the guy the little guy pulled out a spray can - sprayed it into the eyes of the bully.  The bully let of a scream that his eyes were burning and then just slumped over the desk crying over how bad it hurt.  The guy picked on, climbed on his back and started hitting him.  No permanent damage to the bully.  But the spray was instantly effective.  It might not work for you if your ex-boyfriend wears glasses.<br>  <br>  Only other thing you might consider is as the boy's dad, your ex-boyfriend may sue for visitation rights with his son.  Again, probably the best place to start looking for help is at shelters for abused women.    <br>  <br>  The changes you want to make may not be easily done but consider this:  The longer the son sees the behavior the more likely your son is to act like that as he gets older.|`|X7i59NeIaa	This is not easy. You have to get rid of him. You need to give him a date that he has to be out and let him know that if he isn't that you will have him removed. You could also move his belongings out of the house when he isn't present and change all the locks on your doors. File for an order of protection and let the police know how afraid you are. If you don't do something he will continue to abuse you and could harm your child. Don't continue to let him do this. With the order of protection, you can call the police if you see him lurking about your home or your place of work. You can also call your local battered women's shelter. They have all kinds of resources and could help you get free of him once and for all.Please take action or you may be a statistic. Good luck|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	You may not be able to get the police to remove him because he is not a tenant and you've let him live there for free for so long.  Sort of like squatter's rights.<br>  <br>  If you really wanted him out, you'd stop worrying about where he will go and how he will survive.  You may find you need to talk to a lawyer about how to put him out.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Put the place up for sale and MOVE out yourself. Stop finding excuses to still have him around. Find someone else to watch your son. Move in with family while the place is up for sale and than have him removed.|`|S3UxNOhdaa	Only you know how dangerous he really is. So proceed with caution. You should contact your local women's shelter. They can give you sound advice and with the police involvement if necessary. Can you take your son to his grandmother's or to a friend's place while you do this. You don't have to put up with it and alot of times, once you front the bully down, he will back off. Be careful and good luck.|`|ek6FQFiZaa	The solution is a long term one.<br>  <br>  You ultimately need to prepare to protect yourself because the cops will only be there to clean up the mess.  Watch the movie "Enough". It's quite to the topic of your situation and the realization that at some point you have to stick up for yourself.  The movie highlights the Martial Art known as Krav Maga and it's use against an abusive husband.<br>  <br>  FYI, if you seriously decide to take self defense, I  personally recommend Filipino Martial Arts, also known as FMA.  It uses sticks, knives and any other instrument you have around as well as empty hands to defend.  I personally think it is superior to Krav Maga, but both are very good arts.   <br>  <br>  Lastly, if you are saying no, I don't think any training can prepare me to combat a guy that is stronger than me then consider this.  I'm 180 lb male and I've personally trained against 110 lb women who can put me to the ground if I'm not paying attention and sometimes even when I am.  If your ex has no combat experience, I'm certain that self-defense will make you combatively superior to him.<br>  <br>  Others might say get a gun, and I agree with that too.  But the movie illustrates quite clearly a guns usefulness is only in your ability to access it.<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear of your dilemma, and I know this is lot of information, but again the solution is a long term one.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have to agree with RX4U.  Is he truly dangerous to a deadly level, or just a jerk that will physically hit you?  Either way, I still propose self-defense.|`|4Zprn4cMaa	If you ever umemployed, take a look here www.dizny.info/jobzone  and theres a high chance you'll find the right job.|`|4035epvCaa	Well i think the best course of action is to take your losses and try to move on yourself physically. Try to move to a new setting if it's possible. Start a new some where else maybe at a neighboring town. Do tell him those are your intentions and give him a deadline for when both you and him need to move out. Of course he can chose to stay where he is if he can pay the rent. Do not feel bad for him, you need to do what best for you and your son.|`|IT77K1gfaa	Put your son in daycare so that he doesn't have an excuse not to work. you will then have to have him evicted because you legally can't just throw him out. If he is abusive or threatening to you then you will need to get a restraining order and he won't be allowed to return to the home. This whole situation is going to be traumatic for your son but the sooner you get it done the better. He is learning how to be a husband and father by his dad and this isn't the example you want set for him. <br>  <br>  You can contact a local battered women's shelter and they may help you. If you don't own your home it may be easier for you to move out and leave him with the place and the bills.<br>  <br>  You are going to have to get rid of him and the sooner the better.|`|gu2jV40zaa	Well, this is a tough situation. Let me ask you this....do you think it is more traumatic for your son to witness him being escorted out by the police or his own father verbally & physically abusing his own mother? I would say BOTH are equally traumatizing but, I would hate to see the results of him hurting you even MORE if he stays.<br>  <br>  I do not want to give my opinion other than saying this...you NEED to contact a place for battered women. They can help you, advise you of your rights and tell you how to best protect both your son and yourself. <br>  I urge you to do this as soon as possible and do not let him know for your own safety. The more abuse your boy witnesses, the more scarring it will be to him in his life. I sure would hate to see anything happen to you and traumatize your son for life! Call a local hotline in your area and they can direct you further.<br>  <br>  Be safe & i wish you the best!|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Sounds like a scary situation.  Are you renting your home?  If you can move, even if it's into an apartment where he can't find you that would be best.  Then once your living someplace else you can call the police and have him removed from the home your in now.  I'm sorry that we have to live in this world where people are able to hurt us.  You have very valid reasons to be controlled.  Protective orders are only as good as the paper they are written on and unfortunately the police can't arrest a man because your afraid he'll do something.  Until he actually comittes the crime he can do whatever he wants.

Good luck!<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|C4g7F53Gaa	my uncle died when i was 8, then 7months ago my nan died, then last week my grandad died. i know how you feel, ive uncontrobbaly cried myself to sleep for the last 3 days. with my nan i remember it getting easier in a couple of months, trying to put it to the back of your mind doesnt help, because when your alone its always at the front, and theres nothing that can distract you from it. its best to cry it out i guess, it helps the pain, because seriously i know how much it hurts, it does get better :) xx|`|J2fnNPusaa	i am sooo incredibly sorry, i know what youre going through, i hjust lost my grandpa, 3 weeks after my birthday, it suck, he just passed away jan 31, im still not over it, i talk to him every day, and before i go to sleep, it will take time, lots and lots of time.|`|ApoPp1Lhaa	people die. it happens. most of the time there is nothing u can do about it. i've lost 3 friends in the past year. im only a year older than u. you just need to realize that you had a good life with them, their time came and ur memories of that person will never die.|`|zhw48xV0aa	my grandpa died when i was 4 and you just need to talk to some one you trust about it
EDYETUNCaa	I think you're normal. You just want more out of a relationship than sex and getting it on like so many people (both males and females these days). I feel sex is exploited these days ... that without sex man can't live. I think they could ... just aren't being told to. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend is the sweetest greatest guy on this planet. You just need to hold out till you find that guy. He isn't about the sex. He enjoys sitting and talking to me. We cuddle in bed with no thought of sex. You are right. There is no need to do the other stuff. With my boyfriend I feel more loved and truly blessed than I did with any other guy I dated. <br>  <br>  Guys that you want are out there. Maybe you're looking in the wrong places. Try a new venue and see what you come up with. They are out there, and also be open about how you feel right away in a relationship. That might deflect some guys who are only looking one thing.|`|w2ppi6ulaa	I totally agree with you I dont want sex sex sex, I want to talk and cuddle and stuff like that. Men are programed different but there are the rare few that dont need just sex to make a relationship work. They are out there TRUST ME I found one! You just have to be patient and hold out for the best! Hope everythign works out! :)|`|iGYvDXPVaa	I agree with you just bein with that person should be good enough. and sex aint everything to every one, i'm still a virgin and plan on bein one for quite a while.(by choice)|`|I4JlRP6Zaa	no unacceptabel to me i want horny bitches i can please|`|39tz1y6Laa	your normal|`|c2dcd638f0c11bf57553715f0ad99518aa	ok i dont think exactly like u <br>  but i would respect ur decisions and thoughts/opinons|`|0eNowNixaa	there are guys out there that respect you-- those are the ones you go after!!!|`|nkaY8Fg1aa	Girl you are NOT alone!! I think the same way! in fact i'm waiting til marriage!. those that do it otherwise usually screw up their life.. that's their choice|`|ik9hP6FBaa	yea you are normal, and i really like what you are doing.  because i am the same way, i like to cuddle and kiss and stuff but i dont wanna go further cuz im already happy, why go farther when you already have enough? i think what you are doing is great and im happy that you are keeping guys that just want you for sex away. its really nice :)<br>  <br>  <br>  :D <3<br>  Cindy|`|jdLbgBQGaa	its not true that guys only have sex on their minds<br>  either ur being stereotypical or u havent met a decent guy yet<br>  your allowed to make ur own decisions, so just keep looking|`|5a90fa1a4185657fbeb57cbe986114adaa	i agree with the above 3 answers, everything i was thinking!|`|cn49BbRiaa	Yes I think that you are normal, you dont want a guy who just wants<br>  to make out with you. You want some to talk to and cuddle with and take you out. I have a 4 month rule that you need to dated a guy and get to know everything about him before you can sleep with them.<br>  Sex isnt everything, communication and honesty is. Dont you give up your morals in dating for any guy who just want u for sex your worth much more than that. If he cares about you he will respect you decisions.|`|KcloaW4vaa	My opinion on that is similar to urs. To me, sex will just ruin what i have or w/e with the girl becauase thatll be all i want, and it wont be for the right reasons. Talking with her and cuddling and stuff is fun. Getting to know each other is better than getting close if u know what i mean? Id rather have a good laugh, smile and really like the girl before even thinking about having "fun" with her. Taking it slow and really making connections comes first, fun will come when it comes. Theres no rush and at least well both want it when it does happen. I do want to be intimate, but not until we get to know each other, have trust and stuff like that, like months into it at least. If it cant last till then, it defr wont work out. Its not exactly something im into right away, so much as the girl herself. So im sorta with u.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Normal nice and sweet girl with a good head on her shoulders dear:) puts my faith back in the teens :)<br>  <br>  Loads of people feel the same even the guys i know x|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	good question , men wake up with a *****, that's just in our jeans i guess. you need to question yourself first, do you even play with your self, explore what makes you ***, feel good and stuff. these are things you can then share with your partner<br>   (whenever you decide 2 do it) men are not mind readers , and we can use all your ideas you share. its your body, we just want in from time to time.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|I5VvAniXaa	if u don't wanna have sex, then u mite as well date women coz many women r like that but no man is like that. Or don't date anyone and just be friends with everyone.<br>  <br>  my gf is like that (like u) but at the end of the day she lets me bang her coz she loves me and she thinks that I love her.|`|QcqpzFNUaa	i dont think sex is everything, talking and being good friends should be the most important thing, <br>  <br>  however it's look like thats the reason i dont get many girls... i mean i aint that bad looking lol...|`|z3QsWmzpaa	your perfectly normal there are some guys out there that respect your desicion my boyfriend never pressures me into anything and always respects my desicions =]<br>  <br>  you have just gotta wait for the right guy to come along
7dEztbMEaa	Because the system is inherently biased against fathers.<br>  <br>  It needs to change, that is it.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	There are women that have had abortion and the baby was born alive. I don't know if the baby survived or if it did if the mother kept it or put it up for adoption. I think that was why they changed the laws stating how far along you are when you have an abortion. If you are 24 weeks they are not suppose to abort the baby because technically the baby can live outside the womb with assistance.<br>  <br>  But I got off subject, sorry. Women that CPS takes away their children (the ones that don't know who the daddy is) are required to pay. At least that is what I've been told. I grew up on the poor side of town.<br>  <br>  I think that child support should be ordered at the same time the judge orders custody of the child to the better parent be that the man or the woman.|`|89UOqaVNaa	If people weren't so wicked and selfish and disgusting, they would get married before having sex and would stay together for life through good times and bad and raise their children with love and teach them right from wrong. Then you wouldn't have to ask this question.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, society rejects God's good plan for life and is in a sickening mess because of it.|`|BAVPrCAeaa	yes|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	You got me.  Why doesn't the father have custody of the children if they had to go to foster care?<br>  <br>  Sounds like it's time for you to go back to court and get your kids.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I agree with Aimes. What's up with that?|`|IvMPh09baa	I was not aware that was allowed, and that makes absolutely no sense.  I would highly recommend the father hire a good lawyer to fight.<br>  <br>  But, this is a bad example I know... take Britney Spears vs. Kevin Federlines case.  Her children were taken away from her because her hard partying and lack of discpline in her own life... and guess who got custody... the father!  He got custody of his children, even though he's also not such a stand up guy... but it is possible.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Family services has nothing to do with child support.  You have to go to court to get that changed.  BUT the question SHOULD be why weren't the kids placed with their father?  WHY is the father MORE considered with money instead of his kids?|`|OBCvewW2aa	If a father does not step up and save his kids from "the system" why should he have to stop paying child support?  If a mother is denied her children, why should she be further punished?|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	I have never heard this before...but if the mother had an unfit home, why isn't the child with it's father?
XkPgw7ZRaa	Have you tried to think of something else while having sex?  Try longer more enriched foreplay with her.  Bring her to the height of arousal before you enter.  Make sure you two use protection.<br>  <br>  Another technique would be to have her "express" you during foreplay before you enter.  Just an afterthought.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Anthonhy|`|EYt8H5N2aa	You cant really predict that. It depends on the female and if she will feel good to you. Once you feel that feeling you can explode within the first few strokes. Some guys like to masturbate before they have sex to get the first nut out of the way so that they may last longer but you cant predict how long you will go. It depends on the female and what feels good to you.|`|X6hK915Naa	jack off with a condom on or what you need to do is jack off right before sex that way the first time is out the way and the second go around will be longer...so jack off like right before you two go at it so she'll get the second part|`|FnfHTOnaaa	Just think about other things..if you don't focus completely on it you'll last a lot longer and then when your ready...focus completely and you're set|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Try not to focus real hard on what is happening. Think about things that are not arousing. Take a blue pill if nothing works!|`|KTf1OSVIaa	experience. condoms help.|`|gXG3bRwaaa	1 sec<br>  <br>  u cant <br>  <br>  ah hahhaha aur screwedddd!!!!|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	1 minute. cant help it. practice.|`|R46f2nn9aa	30 seconds|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	maybe a minute, as you get older you can increase it to 2 minutes. Try some hydrocortizone to numb it up, that was an old trick, but put it on before you go out, or it'll end up affecting her....and you want her to feel it. LOLZ. good luck Sparky.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	condoms help,but the first time its liek a trial thing for you,you'll get the hang of it and get bette with time and experience|`|4L1c8kF8aa	It won't last long if the sex is good....... trust me, I know..... Good Luck and have fun...........|`|4kuWOZowaa	You wont last to long..but wear condoms please
NzoKZhgFaa	Sweet heart its just natural. Good girls fall for the bad boys and we always end up with one.  You get one life. Go be a rebel!! haha. Just have fun|`|90aff9e8e410604f2804bafe086c61eeaa	There is a time for bad boys - we've all done it, we've all LOVED it. Then, one day, we grew up and got married and had a real life.<br>  <br>  In the mean time: party while you can, take the long way home, live irresponsibly - life passes by so quickly and you deserve to be carefree while you can. <br>  <br>  But know that in the future you will regret some of your choices, so be safe, be as legal as possible and always watch out for your health. :)|`|lQ2pLL2Yaa	there is nothing wrong with liking a guy who is the rebel. i myself dont fall for those goody goody two shoes kinda guys and fall for the ones that make themselves known by getting in trouble. but some guys you might wanna prepare to get hurt by. hope this is good advice. :)|`|Dwea01UWaa	Sure you can have fun. Just make sure you know the difference between having fun and disrespecting or mistreating yourself and owning up to good morals and values, which every respectable young lady should have.|`|BPqK0c5taa	Yes of course you can. Have all the fun you want, I like good girls, my girlfriend is a good girl but she also knows how to have fun as well. Its just better that way.|`|pvDVFrKwaa	Of course all good girls want to have fun. But what they dont want is what alot of those bad boys bring... a broken heart. I'd say go for all the bad boys you want. But be cautious of your heart|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	yes you can have fun with the bad boy just try not to get in trouble and don't wear your heart on yout sleve|`|55ac50ec591a2bbc757c20a9ce8c4322aa	no you cant have any fun marry me and come watch cnn with me for the next 3 days straight and read the newspaper|`|lRWvsrUVaa	relationships with bad boys usually never work out because they usually only have one thing in mind.. haha. so if you're into hookups and no commitment then have fun girl!<br>  but if you're looking more for of a relationship then i think you're taste in guys is a little off.|`|a71dc93591206d19404fc90e323c10faaa	Yes a good girl can have fun, but what kind of fun are you looking to have?|`|mCEVqEgyaa	wat|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	I you know your path and know what you want to achieve then,you should think carefully on whom you want to mix.Real life is not that easy as in the movies.Good Luck.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	who cares|`|0am8r5Hcaa	Yeah Of course you can right up to the point where you get busted for something he did...or you get abused or cheated on by him sure|`|s1pC35Seaa	Yes have fun. Get an STD. Get into drugs. Ruin your whole life. Because "Bad boys" are so much fun.|`|dqnccslNaa	if YOU find it fun. <br>  <br>  if YOU like it. <br>  <br>  then thats YOUR choice|`|iR7StHksaa	bad boys can get good girls into serious trouble...i would not date one. but they are very cute!!!:D
0ulKsvXlaa	You can't get a passport until you are 16.<br>  <br>  You know, I was the same when I was your age. (I'm 54 now)<br>  I always felt that my sisters and parents were picking on me.<br>  They probably were to a certain extent, but not as much as I thought they did.<br>  .<br>  You are experiencing the effects of puberty.<br>  During this stage of your life, very strong hormones are released throughout you body. (nobody warned me what this would mean).<br>  The emotional side effects of this chemical cocktail are as follows :-<br>  <br>  Tiredness. <br>  Caused by waking up so often during sleep. Hormones are released every 45 mins., at night this can cause severe sleep disorder.<br>  <br>  Irritable.<br>  Caused by lack of undisturbed sleep, and the effects of the hormones.<br>  <br>  Lack of concentration.<br>  The hormones have a bewidering effect on the brain.<br>  It often becomes hard to concentrate.<br>  <br>  Sensitive to criticism.<br>  During puberty one feels insecure. Any criticism, no matter how minor, seems to feel like a direct insult. <br>  <br>  Unloved.<br>  When someone enters puberty, the parent of the other sex, tends to distance themselves more. This is a natural thing, to avoid the embarrassing chance of sexual arousal. <br>  One has become sexually active, and the parent is aware of this. <br>  The parent stops the hugs and kisses that they previously gave the child.<br>  This can lead to the teenager suddenly feeling unloved.<br>  (i.e. Father towards Daughter or Mother towards Son, even Sister towards Brother).<br>  <br>  I must tell you that they love you just the same.<br>  The natural distancing should have been explained to you, together with all the other side effects.<br>  <br>  Your brother reacts to you like you are a male challenge.<br>  Look at the animal kingdom and see how brother animals of this age test themselves by fighting each other.<br>  It's a show of strength.<br>  <br>  You are also entering a rebellious part of your life.<br>  You have noticed how cruel the world really is, so many problems, wars and destruction.<br>  Subconsciously you question how your parents and grandparents can leave the world in such a state for you. This will make you tend to dislike them. <br>  The problems of the world are not their mistake though.<br>  These are problems that humans have had since we first developed as a species.<br>  <br>  I wondered why I was born, wishing I hadn't been sometimes.<br>  The reason for that is this weight of adulthood I felt on my shoulders.<br>  This is also quite normal. Try not to let things like this get to you.<br>  <br>  Please don't leave home.<br>  Show this answer to your mother and ask her to talk with you about it.<br>  <br>  Ask your mum to give you a cuddle, sometimes we all need this.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	It sounds like the police or some other authority needs to get involved.  Without your mum's permission you would not be able to go anywhere.  Your brother needs to stop whatever it is he is doing to you - you need to tell someone about it.  No one should EVER abuse another person.  Speak to someone at school who you trust and see what they advise you to do.  Good luck !!|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	You cannot get a passport without your parents consent, or purchase a ticket to Australia. If you run away, then the Police will be looking for you because you are a minor and exposed to moral danger. Then you will be in the hands of Social services. Not a good idea. Why don't you have a talk with your mother and tell her how you feel instead. You can always call Childline and talk about your problems to them.|`|GI27dKIkaa	You CANNOT get a passport at your age - without your parents consent.  Even then - most airlines these days will NOT take unaccompanied children !<br>  <br>  If you need to talk to someone - you'll get much more straight forward advice from child-line on 0800 1111 - calls are free (and therefore don't show up on the phone bill) and confidential !<br>  <br>  Edit:  If you run away from home - the police will just take you back !|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	At 13 you have few options. Do you have any relatives you feel safe to live with enjoy your life. Also, for your safety you may need to contact the police. Do not run away it will only ad to your  problems in ways you can't imagine.|`|rVzsV76aaa	Call the police and have them arrested. Thats what you should do. Honestly what I would do is pick up a hammer and knock the crap out of them but that could never happen to me my brothers have love for me|`|XaSIyG0Paa	Call your aunt and have a serious talk with her, let her know what you feel and whats going on, good luck.|`|aRkYiXtGaa	never a good idea at 13, what will you do for money, how will you get to aus, if you goto any authority office like the passport office, they will call social services|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	shut up and stay with your own familly u r 13 u still cant decide whats better for u u should be 18 at least to think of such thing what acrazy child u got afamilly there's others in the world who dont have that bless open your mind dammit|`|JIAo8cbtaa	talk to someone about it, like a teacher. or if you find it hard talking to someone, write it down, and hand it to that person. but don't do anything drastic right now.|`|b7jWXN4Vaa	don't run away.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	If you truly are being abused then you need to bring it to the attention of a counselor or someone in your school.  They will get you the help you need.  More than likely if the abuse is true and bad enough you will be removed from the home during the investigation and usually they like to place children with other family members but those family members must agree to take you on.  It does not mean that you will live there permanently.  They will investigate and then a decision will be made if you will be returned or whatever.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|9f7da82548dac95c35d6ec34826ec681aa	Have you really thought this through?<br>  Children, younger than you are being removed from their family homes because they're being beaten black and blue by their parents, raped, neglected and you want to leave because you keep arguing with your mum?<br>  Take a look on the internet at costs of flights to Australia.  Who's going to pay for that?<br>  Passports can take about 2months to get processed.<br>  Does your aunt have enough space/money to care for you?<br>  To be adopted, your auntie will need to be checked out by the police in Australia.<br>  If you're being abused, you need to LEAVE your family home and go to Social Care.  You need to demand that you are NOT going back to live with them and they will have to find you temporary foster care or you could stay with a friend until you can sort something out.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Look... you need to wrap your head about how to get along with your parents. You are in head-butting mode... and that will only make your own life tougher... you are bringing it on. If you learn how to work this right, you can get more freedom.<br>  <br>  Do the BASICS... clean up after yourself, do any chores asked of you, make good grades and stay out of trouble... all without being asked. This goes a long way toward keeping you off her radar.<br>  <br>  When your mom yells at you, you give her your full attention and nod and say "Uh-huh" and "yes, ma'am" and you don't dare attempt to defend yourself or debate anything... it only makes you rebellious. All rebellion needs to be squashed... you know that.<br>  <br>  If the issue is your friends/social life... you need to make it a point to bring any friends in to meet your mom, and whenever possible, introduce their parents to your parents as well. It is good form. It goes a long way towards keeping the peace.<br>  <br>  The authorities are going to side with your parents. You cannot run away from your problems because you will only replay those same problems elsewhere. Your goal is to stay out of conflict, stay off your mom's radar (be as little trouble to her as possible), and get through school. If you want to launch after graduation, you need to work and save your money.|`|yITaiBacaa	listen to revsuzan, they are right.<br>  <br>  running away gets the police involved because that is illegal, no matter how crappy homelife is, running away is illegal because you are a minor, and if you really want out, running away just tells the police that you are a stupid child, so you'll never get out.|`|lhmdSgqtaa	If your mom and aunt are on good terms:<br>  talk to your aunt, tell her what is happening and ask if you can come stay with her. <br>  are your cousins around your age? if so, after talking to your aunt and getting her OK to move in with her -have her call your mom and suggest that you come stay with them for awhile to visit with her and your cousins.|`|v3bZqYZjaa	i dunno if you'll be able to get a passport without your mum. And you probabally won't be able to fly to austrailia without your mum either. havent you got any family in the uk you could stay with?|`|7MuFMepgaa	Stay home|`|mx7FINY8aa	Go Live With Auntie Sounds Fun :) x|`|3xEbZuI2aa	Well I wouldn't run away just yet. First I would go to a friends out and ask for help there but take your stuff with you. But you have to make sure there mum or dad will help you get a passport. You can get a passport in less than two months or maybe just a bit longer I think because mine never take too long to do. Also they will let you on a plane on your own unless you get somebody to go with you but whilst your at your friends house ring your auntie and cousins and tell them to meet you and tell them whats happening but not to tell social services. That would be my plan hope it helps bye x|`|ptPvDdU8aa	listen man just stay home because if you dont want the police involved then stay home but if you run away then the cops will be involved because your mom will be worried about you and if you love her then u will stay at home and i am sure you dont want to hurt your mom at all so just stay home and everything will get better but if they keep abusing you then you will have to go to the police to get them to stop or they will keep doing it and it is wrong of your mom not to say anything so u might have to go to the police to get the abuse to stop k
rh3RNM5faa	You don't realize that your step dad cares and loves you. But I think he cares for you way too much that he is doing that stuff to you. He is kind of concerned. He loves you, but you just don't see it. He doesn't mean to be rude or anything.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	he could be stressed or that could just be his personality. he prolly cant help it when he says those things. tell him next time he does something like that.|`|XPYR2gq1aa	Sucks being a teenager because no one will let you have any freaking freedom!  Its bullshit how they expect us to act like an adult without any adult responsibility!!!  ok, maybe thats just my complaint coming in here but YES, your dad was being an ***.  Like most adults he needed to demean you in order to make himself feel smarter or more important.  Weak sauce that your step pops is your teacher!  You will be outta there soon tho!|`|J9D4y8iaaa	Hes not being rude..Seriously, you expect him have a smile on his face when he tries to explain something and you dont understand, another thing, you should be happy hes helping you, you dont see step dads out there giving a ****.|`|41Oy9Lwyaa	mabey he just is thinking of stuff to make u go outside and meet friends or do new stuff or well hes a man soo like  boys dont know how girls feel when u tell them they are ugly or there hair stinks ect .
KsVW0paHaa	Awe your still sick :( no you are not being selfish at all if you don't feel well they should understand.|`|UUmtygTEaa	you're 15 years old. your parents should realize that you being home alone is okay. plus, it's legal. you have a right to not go somewhere you don't want to go to. whenever my parents go grocery shopping, i never go with them because it's so boring. you're not being selfish. plus, you're feeling sick. if you're sick, you should stay at home and rest. your parents should want you to feel and get better, not go out and worsen your condition.|`|Hlm3GjThaa	well, it's not possible for your dad to be pmsing, lol, but he is overreacting. if you're truly sick, i don't see the problem with you staying home unless they don't trust you.<br>  <br>  i think you're right, and no you're not being selfish,|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Yeah I hate it when my parents do that. <br>  <br>  They just want your company, and feel insulted that you turned down their offer to take you to dinner. <br>  <br>  They will get over it, your sick, they are being selfish for calling you selfish.|`|9kuCwhiWaa	Parents hate when their family aren't together.  They take it as "Screw you old farts".  Seriously, that's what is on their mind.  <br>  <br>  Though, why not just a different restaurant?  What's so special about Chile's?|`|Gh9X70efaa	Your dad is. You should be at home. Cause you don't wanna pass out at the restaurant and people call 911...|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	I Dunno Whats Wrong With That, Your Dads Probably Just Being A Douche :D|`|43D89edDaa	Did you tell them that you were feeling sick and that you didn't want to go? Or did you tell them, THAT PLACE IS NASTY and THEN say you didn't want to go. Because if I were your dad i'd be like... dang you've probably only had 1 or 2 things from the menu, try something new and enjoy some time out with the family ya ungrateful kid!<br>  <br>  But then again, I am not SURE exactly what happened.<br>  <br>  Your Dad isn't mad that you don't like chili's, he's upset that you didn't want to go out with the family and Mom's and Dad's like to have their kids with them when they go out to eat as a family. You could have gone just to socialize with them but again you are feeling sick, you could just let them know that..<br>  <br>  Is there something else here?<br>  <br>  Do you just not like food? 1 yogurt? thats not healthy, try to eat something light like soup.|`|n90KqgAEaa	well your DAD probably can't PMS, but if you don't want tp go, then they shouldn't force you or call you selfish. Your at the age where you should be ab;e to make your own decisions, even if its something as simple as going to a restaurant.|`|52otNiElaa	hahah douche.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	i think he was overreacting. maybe he's had a bad day i don't know but he should have not freaked out like that. he could have asked why you didnt want to go. just tell him you don't feel good and so you thought maybe they could go and have a night out together alone. goodluck! and sorry|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	if you're feeling like crap then you've probably got a shorter fuse than usual.<br>  <br>  try to explain to them, you're sick, you've been to the doctors, you're having problems eating easily digested foods let alone a steak with jalapenos, and that you will make it up to them next time and go happily.<br>  <br>  Also, if you hate the food there, suggest that you try a new place after a few weeks or a month, that way they might find a new favourite restaurant.<br>  <br>  hope you get better soon :)|`|5a86d89ea69e82fdaada1b1a8446ca9aaa	Ya why would your dad call you selfish? Doesn't make any sense, and was just a dumb thing to say. Did you explain that you're tired of eating out at Chilli's and that you were sick? Maybe your dad wouldn't have freaked out if you just told them. It kindof sounds like they're mad about something else. Try to find out what's eating (pun intended) them.|`|QbOYIixuaa	Depends. Were you pouting? How sick are you? You're a teenager right? That is a strike against you. Don't you know all teenagers think their parents are idiots? Wait til you grow up. You will realize all of your faults. Any one who would refer to their father as "pmsing" has to be immature. Men don't pms.  Maybe you were sick, pouty and moody. Ever think it was you?|`|bCkw8E8faa	your whining...

Not to say they won't be fun too, but a lot steadier.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	actually,we believe thats when a woman its entering her  prime,so to us a woman in the mid 20s is hotter than ever..|`|GVlzdZKsaa	NO.

x9S6KBejaa	It all depends on what kind of relationship you both have. The whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing to me are just 'labels' that we tag onto those that we love, sometimes more freely than we should be using. But with love, of course, comes respect. If the guy can't respect the situation of knowing that he can get into real big trouble if he tries anything 'physical' on you then obviously he just wants a sexual relationship. Then I'd have to put a beat down on some poor unfortunate a-hole. haha! (which i wouldn't mind). Look, you're way too beautiful to let your guard down for even a second with looks like those. The last thing I'd want to see is for someone to take 'it' away because he's older and wants to take advantage of the situation.<br>  <br>  And your mom...she's just doing her job. She's not being strict...she's just being a responsible adult. There's so many limitations with such a situation and her job as a mother is to make sure he doesn't try anything funny.|`|u2xm5RoQaa	shes worried that you guys might have sex, and the phrase isnt she being strict, shes your mother she can say and tell you what to do with your life.plus it also tells me that you want to do more with him.and havent you heard of people going to jail for that. consider that too.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	she's not being strict but she knows what 19 year hormones can do....and he clearly is going to ask for sex at some point...|`|58e1b1e10dbc48a33c1c0667b5fac25faa	That's dangerous. If anything happens, he could go to jail.|`|n65bjVokaa	NO! That's perfectly fine. I am 17 and my boyfriend is 22 and everybody has a problem with it but I don't care because my parents approve of him and he treats me with respect. Older guys are more mature and usually they treat you better anyways. Go for it hun. And your mom ain't being too strict. She just cares about you very much and she doesn't want anything bad to happen. Eventually, she will change. Give her time.|`|vLKHTXN4aa	just think about the obvious , and not to be rude , but what would a 19 year old boy really be interested with a 16 year old girl.. unless you have had a long history i would not go there....|`|N1z3ArcTaa	no, not at all. The difference of ages is totally normal. Right now he is more mature than you because he's almost an adult and you're still a teenager but whithin 4 or 3 years it won't be noticeable.|`|1e9430635747058e8661817275bad909aa	that depends, well I am believing that she has ur safety in mind but i don't think what anybody says should be the tilt for ur choice. Just do ur thing but make sure u like him for real|`|uqMGjK4naa	I'm 16 and I like a 19 year old. So.. I don't know. I think it depends on the situation. Sometimes okay, sometimes not.|`|YTHmYqllaa	she's afraid ur going to get busy and then he'll leave you and you'll have lost innocence in her eyes for nothing.|`|pUNWFSDfaa	Nope, not too old. Ur hot, so naturaly ur gonna attract older guys. Specially with those eyes. Gorgous!!!|`|gXG3bRwaaa	thats illegal...just so u know<br>  <br>  that guy is a molester|`|26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	I think that this is a big age difference at a very important developmental time in your life. If he finds the things that you do interesting, it seems that he is immature or he has an ulterior motive. At 19, he should be more worried about taking the next steps as a man instead of looking back at doing the things he did when he was 16. The only exception that I would find is if you know him for a very long time and have many people in common. Still, I would be very suspicious and keep your wits around you at all times when you are with him.|`|hVdAgEWhaa	okay, he's over 18, and if does anything sexual he goes straight to jail, cause apperantly you don't see your jail bait.|`|K5rWdGi6aa	She cares for u tat's for certain. Just dun violate the law n u will be fine. Yr mother approve of him anyway, if not she will just ask u to leave him.|`|38432188076da24bd2e484fa5d428e24aa	probably cuz she thinks u will have sex. and if u do he will get into a lot of trouble.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Yes, I do think so.
9NfLuHo9aa	lmfao dude i know the feeling...i am like the best wingman in the world..i actually am proud of that cause when i see my friend with his hott chick i be like, yea dude, i got u that cause i got mad skillz...sad part is i have like zero skillz for myself but for my friends usually the hott chick has a much less attractive friend who i have to make smile while she is being equally entertained or do something stupid and let my friend look like the hero by apologizing an making his entry or w.e...depends on girl n situation but for you i'll recommend going out to a party with friends and just taking it from there or jus go out and talk to people..start conversation, thats key. I mainly go to parties but like libraries get you girlfriends also. Just gotta know how to open cause if ur a wingman you're a closer..for me knowning what to say while she is reading is the hardest part an i hate chessy lines. Just go up to her and be you cause if u pretend to be anything else the relationship is a lie|`|Rj3epU5yaa	wingmen never get the glory, they just get a beer bought for them and thank you when the non-wingman?  gets the kill.  besides i don't pick women up in bars anymore, that leads to bad things.  i go to boarders books or college|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	Man up and take the girl. Just play the game like you don't care and jump in, you'll get them 90% of the time. Just because you go out with the guys don't make you a "wingman". You assume that role, it isn't forced on you. Take the lead and get yours.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..you don't always have to be the wingman appreciably....sometimes your buddies can be the wingmen for you!<br>  Why be the one to be on the sidelines when you can be the front man partner?<br>  Give in to pleasure my friend...not frustration really...cool?|`|EyaqiWPwaa	um...why dont you just ask a girl to give you a sandwich instead....i mean quit letting your dudes hog all the good sandwiches|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	help yerself to sum gals|`|osZ5zVEDaa	You are not always a wingman unless you are taking no initiative. Having a Wingman is great in bar/club settings. You go over there to talk to someone you like and your buddy is helping to cover for you. Then you do the same for them. You can land a great girl as the wingman though. Just cause your bud is zeroed in on some girl does not mean you can not zero in on the girls friend. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tZReiFF2aa	Find better friends to hang out with. These friends obviously do not care for you as they would not have you as a wingman all the time. Hang out and find someone else.|`|W6QatTEbaa	Forget about your friends! <br>  Go out by yourself  so all the girls you find will be just for you!<br>  If you have enough confidence in yourself you can get any girl you want, just go for it dude!|`|K1Lk7BXhaa	get yourself a wingman.|`|YTHmYqllaa	get them to be a wingman. duh<br>  it should go both ways.|`|YFXusnT1aa	Break off formation when you see someone you dig|`|5a90fa1a4185657fbeb57cbe986114adaa	go out by yourself and then u can meet the right girl and have her for yourself.|`|HHniTZTbaa	what is up with that guy and sandwhiches ?_?
A7QROnjLaa	Loners are cool but it's more cool when you chose to be one, and shunned society. Like the lone wolf that the herd don't dare to mess with.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Loners that LONG for friends are antisocial and awkward.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	i am shy till you get to know me. i am 26 next week and although sometimes i wish i was not i am some what of a loner. i sit at work most of the time and eat alone because i don't like getting involved in other peoples gossip or drama and when you work where i work it's hard to avoid it. i have a close friend who is the same way and we sit together on breaks but other then that by ourselves. i also don't like talking on the phone while im around people i feel im being rude not talking to them. i don't care what people think. i don't judge them but if they want to judge me go right ahead , but it's more worth it to get to know me!|`|WI1CepN4aa	I can understand your situation because sometimes I feel like I am a loner but guess what!  I like the way I am and I don't care about what people think about me.  I do have friends but in a setting like work I don't talk to coworkers that much.  Just don't think about it as a problem and things will workout for you.|`|tUDgxv88aa	Honestly, I know a guy...who is actually a friend of my bf. He is pretty much a loner. If it wasn't for my boyfriend being his friend for so long...I don't think he would have friends...I mean it took him til he was almost 20 to find a girlfriend...and I had to hook them up! All you can do is try to be more social...talk to more people. Go out on a limb and just talk. Nothing bad can come out of it! You won't lose anything...just don't listen to what people around you...maybe go to a bar...get a few in you and just have fun. That always makes my friend a LOT more social!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11485494	well. for someone who mid 20 doesnt need a lot of friedns.. just need someone as a lover to make a family.. lol... and work.
D6ytv2Bjaa	That's really messed up of them.  I had a friend like this, and I just told her "Seriously, if you don't like me enough to pay attention to my life, then we aren't as good of friends as I thought."<br>  She actually started listening to me after that.<br>  Just TALK to her. TELL her that you feel like you don't communicate anymore, and if she is a real friend then she will think of something other than herself for once.|`|eYmIlVnGaa	they are selfish and think it makes them more popular to act that way in front of people.

They are not ur real friends.<br>  Or, they could be upset w/ you about something. Maybe you said something or did something that  hurt them and you don't realize it. <br>  If you can't figure it out, then stay away. You might be drifting apart and you need to give them some space. <br>  And if they only act this way around certain people, they are still not your friends.

She then got into lying and blah well we won't get into that. I'm not saying you're just like her, and are complaining for attention, but if you're friends are like me, I stop listening, caring, and/or believing, and don't want to be around that girl anymore. Analyze yourself and see how much you "tell your friends how you're feeling" everyday. You might be surprised at how immense amounts of complaining can affect a friendship.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Is it possible they think you're being a drama queen and constantly need attention? No one likes somebody who's constantly complaining. On the flip side, I do understand that you expect your friends to be supportive.

IYs97ho2aa	You said it yourself that you're stressed. Stress causes the sex drive to get low low .. happens to me. <br>  <br>  My advice would be get a hobby, like start running again to calm yourself, go for walks, some weights at home, or sit ups. You'll start feeling great in no time. Do things with your wife, start dating again (like I think you used to do before marriage), do different things so it won't be the same routine. I don't know even bathe together, heck even eating dinner in a different room.<br>  <br>  You'll be yourself in no time, and sex will come along.|`|FhKtIk2Paa	The answer is simple: you need to make some lifestyle changes.

zSq1cS35aa	they are idiots, period. octomom has enough for 15 women. i guess for whatever reason alot of women think it is their duty to reproduce? like there is a line of babies witing to come into this happy world? you wanting to provide for yourself and not bring a "waiting" child into this "happy" world and struggle through the next 18+ years for the 2 of you is a selfish act. people are shallow and people are idiots, period. i laugh at that commercial that says "people are smart...." then they push their product. people are so stupid they'll buy that product because that company told them it was the smart thing to do. im 30 male never married, no children, wouldnt mind kids but scared that i might find a woman that will spend the rest of her life with me, since my current and past relationships havent broken the 3 1/2 year mark. i thank god i have no children at this point. you do you! 1 less minivan on the road!|`|XmJZkFuMaa	It depends on your reasons not to have a child.<br>  <br>  If you don't want a child because you want the extra money and freedom and such, then it's selfish.  Why?  Because in that case you're thinking of yourself above all others, including a future baby who might thrive in your care.  It's like there's a bumper sticker in my city where it says something like "We're retiring at 45!  Happy being childless!"  If the entire purpose is money, then it's selfish.  Think of it like this.  If you have the means to provide well for a child, and to help them become like you (and people see you as good enough to reproduce) then withholding a future you that could be that good is selfish.  *shrugs*  It comes down to evolutionary-wise, do you believe that you are a contributor to society or that your future child would be worth anything to society?  <br>  <br>  If you don't want a child because you're no good with children and the thought of having a child makes you feel queasy, then it's not selfish.  If you don't want a child because the thought of giving birth scares you, you need to consider adoption more often.  If you don't want a child right NOW because of age or just not feeling ready, but are open to it in the future, you're wise.<br>  <br>  Personally, for me, having a child was a way to say that I have hope for the next generation, and here is my contribution.  I hope to have more children.  And I hope to raise them to the best of my ability so that the next generation benefits.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the semantics though.   Most people I know are either very young and say "I won't have a child" because at the time they can't imagine it, then in 10 years are ready and happily become moms and dads.  Or they're honestly wanting the money and don't want to invest in the next generation, which is where "selfish" as a label comes in.<br>  <br>  In the end, it's your choice and folks should leave you alone.<br>  <br>  Add:  Heh.  Knew I'd get thumbsdowns for just answering why someone might see it as selfish.  Just answering the question.  <br>  <br>  The question you MIGHT ask yourself is whether being selfish is bad?  Do you want a higher education, why?  To get more money?  That's selfish.  But is it bad?  Depends on what you use the money for in my opinion, but again is it bad?  That's the moral choice, and one I'm not willing to judge someone on.  Just because a choice is made for selfish reasons does not mean it's evil or bad.|`|RtkB46peaa	All the reasons I know of are religious.  And all of those religious reasons are stooped in ulterior motives by the religious groups.  I look forward to hearing any other responses that aren't far reaching.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	I dont want kids, I have never wanted kids. I have no idea why someone would call me selfish for not wanting piss, sh*t and puke all over me with a screaming kid in my ear everyday, then a disgruntled teenage basket case during the teen years.<br>  <br>  No thanks, not for me!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It is not selfish. It is a personal choice and no one should put you down for yours. The people that do give you a religious answer need to stop being hypocrites, it is not their place to judge anyone. Having children is not a requirement in life.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Because you are choosing your own needs over the needs of your relatives to have a baby in the family to dote over.|`|bBSAFsrhaa	lol really?? i've never heard that n i dont want kids..|`|buN06G6Daa	It is not selfishness. Everybody doesn't want children. There are those who do and those who don't. <br>  <br>  It can be selfish to have children; I have heard many women say that they want children so that they'll have someone to take care of them in their old age. That can be considered selfish.<br>  <br>  Remember that many people feel obliged to give their opinion on the matter and to berate those who don't want children.|`|g5jvbZGVaa	Joshy made me laugh lol<br>  it's not selfish at all, i've been a surrogate mother because, I myself don't want any children but mother nature gave me health and a womb so I use it for the benefit of someone else.(a dear friend) :] I don't want children of my own because i'm too skeptic of the government and the world to raise children in it.|`|isRDHbJgaa	I find that people who aren't finished "partying", or traveling or their career are the ones that mostly don't want kids. Take me for example, I didn't even want to get married. But when you find the right person, you feel like doing all those things.<br>  <br>  However you must marry or get with someone that wants the same as you. It doesn't make you selfish, you just don't want to have children, some people should think like you.<br>  <br>  And people that say that, that is what you suppose to do, they are full of BS and that says a lot about them, you do you what YOU want to do!|`|PdY9ylZCaa	er. because that's what people are supposed* to do: get married, have kids. people who don't get married are sinners (couldn't resist). and people who don't have kid contributing to the demise of the human population.<br>  <br>  my opinion: some people shouldn't be allowed to have kids.<br>  <br>  but i suppose not wanting to have kids could be construed as: well what the hell are you doing living for if you're not going to "pass down" your genes/carry a family name/ etc?!|`|CgwEfwOZaa	its not being selfish, its being smart.  a lot of people have kids who are not even ready and therefore screw up the kids life as well as their own.  <br>  <br>  not everyone is designed to have kids and if you're smart enough to realize this, then you're smarter than them all!|`|kWKZoQogaa	I don't think it's selfish at all. I actually think it's a mature decision, as some people just aren't cut out for children.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Its not selfish at all. If you dont want to reproduce thats your own choice. <br>  <br>  I wish other people wouldnt force their beliefs on others. <br>  <br>  (By the way your going to hell if you dont reproduce)|`|yUGwWOWIaa	It's not selfish. Kids just aren't your thing. There are a lot of people who don't have kids.|`|aTmvjG7vaa	I personally find it to be a rather selfless thing in many ways, especially with the way the world is looking with  population, we just have so many people and if some people decide that they a) aren't cut out for kids b)want to live a life and not feel tied down by kids c) shouldn't have kids based on medical things d) other . . .I think it is great to adopt to, especially if you can't have kids of your own. <br>  The sad thing these days is that it seems like there are the crazy over protective parents that want perfect little angel children, and then there are neglecting parents, you know? And it to me is more selfish to have kids to try to turn them into perfect robots than it is to just not have kids. <br>  And very selfish to have kids but then still live like you don't, or to hurt them. <br>  So I can see where people are coming from when they say not having kids is selfish in the respect that, you are choosing to live a life for yourself, and do whatever you want. But this could include a lot of selfless things too, soo. <br>  If you don;t want kids, just don't have them. Don't let your parents make you have kids because they want grandkids either, it's not their choice.|`|pWNPWYSIaa	The decision one makes to not have children is and should be their own personal choice, and it certainly isn't selfish, as long as they take the appropriate precautions to not become pregnant. The only way the decision would be selfish would be if the woman got pregnant then decided she didn't want to have a child and had an abortion to end the pregnancy.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I feel the opposite, especially when people have kids just to have a kid.  Some seem to believe they must reproduce, even if they are broke,  have anger issues or other emotional issues, can't get along with others, have no forethought about what raising kids entails, and i could go on forever.<br>  <br>  Plus this is a cruel and violent world we live in.  There is more food for thought.  What is the planet going to be like in 40 years?  Probably worse than it is today.<br>  <br>  I think that not having children is a personal choice  And those who don't have kids, can live a very full and satisfying life.  I read questions on this site almost every day from kids whose parents are drunks, neglectful,  nasty, rude, abandon them, scream, yell.....<br>  <br>  These same parents are likely the type who say not wanting children is selfish.... go figger.|`|lQ7yImeSaa	I have no clue. I can think of many instances where having children IS selfish (such as inability to care for, and raise them). Many people have children without realizing why they are having them, which is really a tragedy to the children because they never asked to be born to parents who weren't fully ready to care/ take care of them.|`|n90KqgAEaa	some people just aren't ready for children or think they can't handle them, so not having children is not selfish. If you consider your living enviorment and everything, it may actually be a good choice.( cause if u diod have a child and you couldn't take care of them, think about the pain it would cause them.)|`|2t1AJQLsaa	Please, because that is how you were born.<br>  <br>  It's in the human nature to reproduce.  That is pretty much our calling just like all the other animals, to keep our species alive.  Not wanting children goes against the laws of nature.<br>  <br>  But, you have the complete right not to want children.  Why should you have to?  It's really not that selfish, lol.  Now I'm contradicting myself.  It's a personal choice.|`|HQssYZ8taa	I dont think its selfish. It's just another life being brought into this world that might suffer from illness or cancer. You dont really have to listen to what others say. But for me, i do want kids (in the future) and if someone called u selfish for not wanting a kid, then tell them to **** off|`|Aw2KS5swaa	They might mean not wanting to have a child you are pregnant with is selfish because it is taking a life just to avoid the annoyance of having to take care of the child. However, not wanting children in general...um, i don't think that's selfish...|`|tncGu6Ymaa	I don't think it is selfish it's just that you don't want to have children, that is your opinion not someone else's. If you think you can't handle it than that is fine.<br>  <br>  Peace out Dood!|`|Q6JREEy9aa	It isn't.<br>  <br>  How can it be?  There's absolutely nothing selfish about it.  Selfish is someone trying to tell you that your decision should be the one they'd make.  <br>  <br>  Pay them no mind.|`|kU0pC50Uaa	what the heck i dont see how it is either heck its your body your decision you can do whatever you want, plus we dont need anymore little babies running around in this economy haha|`|dlrximyQaa	That's what they think.

AA11294818	Ohhhh, I've lived this story time and time again. To be honest, I have come to one conclusion. You usually can't keep the friendship... because I've seen that I'll always have wanted more with that person, otherwise, unless I luckily grew out of it which usually didn't happen. It took me a while in each case to wean myself off that friendship and move on with life... then I realized I didn't miss them and it was nice to not have my heart tortured. I am now married to a wonderful person, and whenever I see the guys I had friendships with that I had tried to preserve though I really really liked them as much more than a friend... I realize that I have nothing in common with them and I don't really need them as friends in my life (though I wish them the best).<br>  I think it's just something that we all go through and must endure to become the people we want to be.. love hurts!!!|`|m8QfHC7uaa	Situation's like this are not easy.  <br>  You don't have to stop liking her; but are you in love with her?<br>  You need to move on. <br>  The both of you may feel a little further apart, but it sounds like you need to. She has a boyfriend and she is keeping you tied to her.  You need to back off, no words needed at first, just slowly back off little by little.  You'll find yourself happier and she will have more time with her boyfriend which is where she should be.|`|ft8nZREnaa	find other women|`|ulYTAfXtaa	just try to put some unmentioned boundaries between you guys. if you call her every day, move it to maybe once every other day. if you two are very touchy-feely, limit it to hugs when departing only, etc, etc. start hanging out with other friends more and try not to think about it so much. friendships can be maintained even if there are other feelings present, it just takes work.<br>  i hope it all goes well for ya man!|`|u2xm5RoQaa	guys really cant be friends with girls only because of this reason. sadly you may have to quit being her friend the other sad thing is she could have you as a boyfriend and she just doesnt care.|`|HnxLXElzaa	They're not options or you just won't? Consider your options.|`|wck4MHREaa	Ok, so don't tell her= that's a terrible idea, unless she's made it absolutely clear that she's in love with you (and I'm guessing that she's not).<br>  Do avoid her for a bit- make her miss you, actually. Trust me, it'll work, plus you need some time to clear your head and stuff.<br>  <br>  Also, it has been said that to get OVER one girl, you should try getting UNDER ten other girls, if you know what I mean...<br>  <br>  But seriously, move on. Talk to all sorts of girls- there are just tons out there, and you pretty much have your choosing. She's not going to change her opinion of you overnight, so take some time away from her to be a different, better person, date around for a bit, and then come back into her life. Then hopefully, she'll realize that you're different then before, and maybe she's attracted to this new you.<br>  <br>  Edit: I realized that I basically said "Ignore her for a good while", and I don't really mean just that. I think you should spend far less time with her, and don't talk to her as much (play it as if you're "busy")- besides, doesn't she have a boyfriend that she can spend time with anyways? Don't completely stop the relationship, just be more "out of reach". It's a hard balancing act- you need to be there for her but not necessarily always be around her all the time, but I really can't tell you how to do that.|`|wCsQUZGlaa	You have to avoid her, there's no other way. Be nice to her, say Hi, See ya, don't be rude to her, but that's it. You have to be distant. Everytime you see her, try going away. You MUST BE NICE TO HER, or she'll believe she did something wrong. DON'T look at her, avoid eye contact.<br>  And GET A GIRLFRIEND! You need to move on. At least, try to get one. You'll move on if you start liking another girl.|`|YYdtd47baa	you should wait until her and her boyfriend break-up. if they dont then i guess you have to just carry on as her friend only. it might be hard..but just be thankful for the time you do have with her. it should be enough. you should absolutely get a girlfriend, and go out on dates though. that is good for you, maybe you'll meet someone special. good luck.<br>  Izy|`|pyjOGiCOaa	Time cures everything .. you will eventually not fell that attracted to her ... Think of it this way too, "after something good leaves, is because something better will come along" ... have faith brother, all you need is to start looking for a girl that has the qualities you like (including being single) ... it will happen if you let it happen.|`|ASSu08qIaa	Okay...I had a situation like this...and it turned out that my guy friend liked me too...and even though there was this other girl, when he found out he liked me...he told her they weren't going to happen...and we are happily in a relationship...I don't know what to tell you...but don't ignore your feelings...and I hope she realizes that you are right for her...|`|HHniTZTbaa	If you like her you shouldn't ignore your feelings. If you don't like her enough then thats that, but maybe you could drop hints. Worst thing you don't talk for a bit, but if she's a friend it will be okay, good luck x|`|ooJC99gmaa	Cant stop liking someone that easily. Just Think about being friends with her more than you like her ya know?|`|bC8r2YTCaa	think about someone else or just find flaws in her and just remind yourself about her flaws|`|paQ8HaH7aa	Since you don't seem interested in any other person at this time, which is quite normal, try to expand your circle of friends.  Become active in volunteer work or join a class.  Expanding your circle of friends is a great way of having more people available to do activities.  Try not to get romantically involve for about 3 to 6 months with anyone you meet, even if you and another person feel attractive to each other.  Just maintain platonic and causual contact.  However, if you get invited to any event, go.  Go, with a new attitute, because if you have been invited, obviously your presence is wanted.  Do not go to any event or get together with anyone with pre-expectations.  If someone really likes somebody else,  they normally find a way to let the other person know.  One way to let a person know that you like them (in your situation) is to have a sit down.  You do that by asking the person to meet you at their convience; let them know that you want to talk with them. When you do meet, thank them for their time.  <br>  <br>  You been the conversation, by telling them that (in your case) you both met about 3 years ago, and that you have been impressed by her.  That you have grown fond of her, throughout these years, but you have avoided telling her, because you respect that she has a boyfriend.  Now, however, this situation is causing you some concern, because time is going by, and that you think that it's only fair that before you move on, you will let her know your feeling to get a response from her.  That you want to be fair to yourself and your feelings, and also be fair to her.  Tell her that you already have accepted if she does not feel the same way, but that if she feels differently, and actually has thought of you the same way that you feel about her, you would like to know.  <br>  <br>  Tell her that you have a time period (about one month) before you move on.  And tell her, that if she wants to maintain a friendship, that would be ok, but that she should consider your feelings and that limited contact is best.  Also tell her that she does not have to respond right then, and that within that month to follow, you can meet with her, if she wants to discuss the matter.  Tell her, please to keep the conversation private, because it is of a personal nature, and that you are ok with what ever decision she may take.  Thank her and say good bye.  <br>  <br>  Don't call her again.  If she calls within that month, take the calls without expectation.  Give that other person a month.  After that month, if she does not make an effort to contact you or if she decides not to explore her options, than accept that.  Meanwhile hopefully, you would have taken my advice to expand your circle of friends and activities.  <br>  <br>  These love pains are part of growing old.  I have loved and lost so many times, and it really is sad when you lose someone that you love.  But know this one thing:  Out there in this world of ours there are so many beautiful lonely people, just like yourself, waiting to meet someone like themselves and like you.  You just have to get out there and meet as many people as possibel.  Go.

toWa68Goaa	Well i have experience in this category as i went to an Italian exchange two weeks ago. <br>  Firstly, say how it will improve your language skills and it will also boost your grade for your GCSE from an A to an A*.<br>  Secondly, say that your friend Ellen went and that she stayed with a family and the parents are fine and that it is perfectly safe. Of course, they will have their doubts at first, everyone did (even me) but honestly it was the best time of my life.<br>  <br>  If that doesnt work tell them to go and speak to me and lizzie :)<br>  We will try to convince them :)<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  xx|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Do your research and present them with the facts.

First and foremost, no more kids until your careers are up and running. The next thing you should look to do is spend some time together as a couple and try to reconnect to something fun - away from your daily responsibilities. After spending a good day together, then reconnect at a different level.|`|XPYR2gq1aa	First off, Im a lesbian, so I cannot comment on the whole "is this how it should be" deal, but Ive heard that it usually fades.  This is a wide variety of things to spice it up but mostly just to be open to what HE wants and for him to be open to what you want and to be able to talk about it.  Some options for spice include: public sex, handcuffs/ restraint/ pain, role-playing, dress up sexy, simply "play it up" and you will see him get more excited at how he is exciting you, toys, toys, toys (as any good lesbian knows, toys for guys and girls enhance it all but especially for you get a small plastic ring that slides over his willy and then ride him with it on) even bring someone else in (tho may be drama!!!!).  <br>  <br>  This is the most vocal ive ever been on here but its important to keep it not awkward for you guys to discuss and try new stuff.  Some of this is porbably out of your comfort area, and mine for that matter, but there is nothing wrong with kinky **** if it helps with, arguably, the most important part of your relationship!!!!!!!|`|Si1K1Srxaa	There are plenty of things you can try...<br>  For example, try handcuffs, walking around in your underware, randomly attack him...don't do it every night..be selective...|`|JOsfVR3Vaa	Ask the neighbors for help.
W6QatTEbaa	Give it some time and maybe you'll find out it's not love after all,<br>  Sometimes the "love" we feel it's simply the desire to be in love, and we believe we are really in love when in reality we are just in love with the idea of being in love.<br>  <br>  But if you are certain that it's love then just go out a lot, meet new people and find someone you like even more than this person you are falling for.|`|WhBlTGUiaa	Sorry, you cant|`|tZReiFF2aa	become a machine turn off all emotions when it comes to women|`|R46f2nn9aa	Being in love is amazing!

PiczCyjbaa	Not necessarily odd.  I would guess that either they don't desire to go through the process of getting married or they don't want to get into something as serious as marriage if they're unsure, which after 10 years you'd think they would know but really there could be a variety of reasons why they haven't married.  As a married person, I say - don't rush it!|`|AA10494978	If it works for them, why mess up a good thing?  I know a couple who dated for 3 years, moved in together, purchased a house and lived together for 17 years then sold the house, purchased a new one and decided that after 20 years they want to get married.  Mind you, everything was going great up to that point.  They had a child, they had the best home life I ever saw, and as soon as they got married something happened to them.  They started arguing, they started neglecting each other and 6 months after they got married they ended up divorcing.  But here is the weird part.  After the divorce they went to therapy for a while, started talking again, and a year later they moved back in with each other and they seem (SEEM!) to be doing really well.  They are not married, technically, but they are back to the way they were before the marriage.  <br>  <br>  To each their own.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	It's happening more and more...<br>  <br>  With divorce rates the way they are, ppl are starting to think they shouldn't get married if they'll have to go thru the pain of divorce.<br>  <br>  Others don't get married even tho they have have been dating over a decade because people are getting married later in life, one reason being that both people are starting a career now, instead of just the man.<br>  <br>  Still others.... just don't want to get married because of the label. They want to stay bf and gf forever, thinking it somehow keeps it fresh.|`|PPwsaeUxaa	That depends on how you look at it. I wouldn't make assumptions about them. Maybe they don't want to get married. Perhaps they consider marriage an institution that doesn't represent their view of their own personal commitment. That's why we have civil unions. It happens. Get used to it. <br>  <br>  Why does everyone have to conform to others' ideas of what is normal? I should be used to that sentiment living in Asia, but I'm guessing you're not from a family with a strong Confucian background?<br>  <br>  Guess people expect conformity everywhere, huh?<br>  <br>  Then again, maybe they don't have such a well thought-out reasoning behind it. Maybe one of them is lazy and the other waiting for the proposal. Not everyone is Bruce from the movie Bruce Almighty, though. <br>  <br>  Why don't you ask them about it? How the heck do we know the details of their lives?|`|UDInHk0jaa	I would think that they are doing what they want to do. <br>  <br>  I don't think it is odd...my aunt never got "married" and I didn't think she was odd.  She was an incredible person and had a wonderful partnership with the man she was with for years and years. They didn't feel like they needed to be married to share a companionship and love that alot of married couples I know don't have.  This man (even without the "marriage" commitment) stood by her and loved her even when she was terribly ill and died of Lou Gehrig's disease.<br>  <br>  To each his own!!!|`|TQVk1k9Saa	Well, I know an older couple who have been together for over 15 years and they are not married.<br>  <br>  Kurt Russell & Goldie Hawn-26 years together. <br>  <br>  Different strokes for different folks.<br>  <br>  I prefer marriage however there are people out in the world that rather cohabit. It does not work.|`|s1pC35Seaa	My aunt and uncle have been together for much longer than that. They just never felt like getting married. Maybe they don't like the idea of getting married? But by law if you are together for a certain amount of time you still are considered "married". So I don't think it is weird at all.|`|fzVJrBUiaa	Sweetie, I dont think its wrong. My father is with my mother for 26 and more years they have 8 children together and he never or not even consider MARRYING my mother. Some man just aint ready to commit or has been hurt so badly that they cant trust NO woman.<br>  <br>  I know its strange but things like that can happen.|`|99eCtW9baa	if you don't know by now you'll never know if you want to be with that person for the rest of your life. or your just scared of commitment i'm not sure|`|AA11394289	I would say either crap or get off the pot so to speak.

In time you will get all the information you need.|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	i agree with the other person, just go for it!<br>  best of luck, and try to get to know her a bit before asking her out.<br>  <br>  always go to her check out line and make up inside jokes. then after a few times say something like "hey... do you wanna go get an ice cream or something when you get off?" then get her number.... it goes on from there<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Go On loll ,you can do it. sure you can get over your fear and get an appointment fo a date.|`|aRcHbMXoaa	it'll suck to get rejected, but it'll suck even more to have not spoken to her and ask yourself "What if I just talked to her..?"|`|iR7StHksaa	flirt with her a little and get her number and always smile!<br>  please help  me : <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar0cnAWxR8VHH9LJHXITQwXIZwx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226201547AAqmuuq">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|59HXAtRHaa	FLIRT FLIRT n FLIRT some more!!|`|5lDyVBUuaa	first off really wierd cause i work at target as a cashier!! lol.<br>  i say if you honostly dont think you gotta chance with her DONT DO IT.<br>  it.ll only kill your self steem.<br>  i say like that other girl said..<br>  go to her register and say a little somethin not too flirtatous.<br>  like "so hows your day goin?"<br>  show that you care, girls always fall for that.<br>  well then just strike up a conversation, a short one.<br>  if she sorta brushes you off or makes her answers short then she aint feelin ya.<br>  if she.s sayin alot or quiet but smilin alot she.s feelin you somewhat.<br>  <br>  after a few times of goin there. just smile but dont go to her register every time.<br>  but smile and then after a while go to her register and say somthin like "do you got a boyfriend".if she says yea just say "oh well too bad" and walk awaay.<br>  she will say no if she is intrested. so say well  "i dont wanna get you in trouble here at work but think i can get your number?"<br>  <br>  iono i hope this kinda helps.|`|kU0pC50Uaa	you should go in her register line and while shes ringing you up talk to her casually at first so you guys get to know her make suure you buy a lot of things so the conversation can go on for longer|`|lQ2pLL2Yaa	definatley. it doesnt matter where u r or where u work. if u r attracted 2 her, talk 2 her. hope this works out. :)|`|Wk75dqR0aa	go for it!|`|93e28c7a08b65069e3d97c485ab2a6fdaa	Homeboy man do what you gatta do,its like if you dont know you never will huh????just dint use her.

Srry, but pretty obvious. But anway, you can go ahead and ask him out if you are interested in him. He might be shy or deny it through embarrassment or deny it because he thinks it's a joke, though, so be convincing. :)|`|wXx8RcOvaa	Well,,,,, if his is as stupid as use then you have a chance with his!<br>  <br>  Fricking moron, try using just a little bit of proper grammar. Another thing stupid, how do really expect people who don't know you or the his you so much adore to help you with this.  It's 2009, walk up to his and talk to his.  Let's just hope you communicate with words much better than you do with your grammar.<br>  <br>  Good luck dumb dumb!|`|bZZEIjmFaa	yeah probably make yourself available and he will act if he knows what he is doing.|`|GuJ5NGmdaa	aw yes. maybe he is just really nice or is too shy to say anything so he just smiles, i believe this is it. i mean if he told all his friends that, he MUST really like you. ask him...if hes too shy to do anything and you are too how will you ever know? talk to him and good luck. at worst youll be good friends.|`|sVHDfL34aa	he is flirting flirt back and maybe after a few days when you get close bang then ask him out or on a date :) thats what i did and im only 14 and i have been going out with my girlfrind now for 1 year<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK FINGERS CROSSED|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	If he just smiles every time he see's you, then you leave him speechless. Yes he likes you, talk to him.|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	yeah, he likes you if he told other people you're his girl. Approach him.|`|N1z3ArcTaa	ok let me tell you. How old is he and how old are you? If he's between 13 and 17 you can't really be sure if he does like you or if he is making fun of you (I mean laughing at you because he knows you like him). So better don't let it be noticed, don't let him know that you like him until you know what he thinks of you because he might play with your feelings. Now if he is older than that he probably likes you for sure.|`|466b2d8db5a8962c790b427f7305754daa	Here's how you can check. <br>  Next time you walk by, have a small but CUTE accident. Bump into him or drop something small. Don't forget to say "oops".  Say sorry and introduce yourself. Then Say something like, " It's so funny, I always see you, but never knew your name."  If he tries to continue the conversation then of course he likes you. If he says something like, " don't worry about it" (for the accident) and doesn't take the conversation elsewhere, then he's not interested.  Be cautious of your own desires for the conversation to mean more than it really does.  If given an opportunity, the guy will almost always initiate. Don't push the conversation along, let him do the work.<br>  <br>  From this point on, every time you pass him by,  say "hi NAME" and don't forget to include his name.  This lets him know you notice him.  If you're brave, compliment him. Nice hair, nice shoes, nice jacket...or just jokingly tease him about how big his muscles have gotten over time. :) have fun and flirt. If he flirts back later on, this means he's interested but is just shy. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zl0YHMD5aa	I cant help you|`|jpVFYgHraa	lol @ amy|`|dEI3gYutaa	maybe..try talking to him|`|JgEhGpydaa	wow idk i think u should talk to the guy|`|czrXarSLaa	if you don't know him very well then its not as awkward to ask one of his friends if he likes you. or ever better get one of your friends to ask him or his friend. <br>  he might just be being friendly. if you dont wanna do either of the above, then just start talking to him and get to know him.|`|OqGQ7WkBaa	ummm. first of all START TALKING TO HIM as a friend. nothing is wrong with being curious if he likes you or not. try and get to know him and when you do, he will probably end up telling you if hes interested in something more.<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps. make sure that hes more than a cute face before getting too involved.|`|JfWFI3FPaa	Boys are just as shy as girls, or in some cases even more; just in fear of rejection!<br>  SO, you never know until you try.. SO go for it!<br>  Add him on msn or something, atleast!<br>  TALK, hang out :]|`|7TnwDFxraa	well things dont always seem what it seems.<br>  he might like you but theres a chance that he dont!<br>  he probably wants to get to know first.|`|IkgyyPtYaa	well, its hard to say but might do, but guys like girls and like to "know them better" in front of their mates|`|jIsAIwCgaa	I think for now you should focus more on spelling and grammar class rather than a boy in the halls. not trying to be mean, but girly that was hard to read...|`|Xhg5XUSWaa	He's smiling at you so what do you think that tells you...|`|swTjhCznaa	probably|`|FlgTkLn0aa	life to short to wonder ...pull him aside and just ask him ..put this to rest.|`|515782c76e890f4976ed59a78d08f354aa	it seems to me like he is flirting with you...maybe he is to scared to just come out and say he likes you? do you flirt back? if not you should that is definitely a good sign maybe the next time he smiles at you look at him in the eye stop him in the middle of the hall way and ask him if maybe he wants to do something after school. if he says yes that's an even bigger sign trust me showing that you are interested in him might make it more comfortable for him to come out and tell you he likes you maybe hes just shy and afraid to tell you just like you are afraid to tell him.....<br>  <br>  <br>  you like most girls are scared of rejection<br>  but trust me knowing the answer is<br>  worth risking it than to just<br>  sit around and day dream<br>  and have fantasy's about the guy<br>  <br>  go out there and show him what you got<br>  let him know that you like him<br>  whats the worst that could possibly happen???<br>  <br>  at least you will know your answer and you wont be so <br>  anxiously waiting all the time|`|BnFvdIdxaa	Ask him|`|JOsfVR3Vaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  Whilst you sound like a mighty fine gal, I must disagree with your use of the word 'his'. You sound like a complete retard and therefore the chances this guy likes you are slim at best and even if you use your devil powers to seduce him your constant misuse of the English language will drive him away quick smart.<br>  <br>  P.S: Don't give up, take some English classes and try again :)<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)|`|stEFmt1qaa	If you like him ask him out or make your move.  I find it kinda weird that you two don't speak but he called you "his girl".  But even if he doesn't want to go out w/ you, no big deal.  There are millions of guys that will go out w/ you.|`|PiF42aaOaa	how about you throw a little party in ur basement, invite some friends and him. awesome way to meet people. you should try. works for me and my friends.|`|QWeBBKdlaa	It sounds like he does but may be to shy to approach you. Take initiative and start talking to him.|`|DlrHF9L5aa	sounds like he does like you and he wants to play with your feelings and emotions, just ask him if he's interested in you what could it hurt|`|ZGIzwLqvaa	im a guy and im guessing he likes u and u should try talking to him and try to get him ti ask u out|`|Z2g928zYaa	talk to him and see if he likes u then go out with him but if he dosent then move on honey lol

My boyfriend of five months broke up with me the weekend before valentine's, and we promised that we would remain friends since we're each other's best friend. So, for valentine's, since we both didn't have any plans, we agreed to see a movie at our college's student center--just as friends, nothing more. Well, after sitting through the movie, we both decided that we should give our relationship another chance, and so we got back together on valentine's. We didn't have anything romantic planned, turned out to be just a casual meeting, but in the end, I got the greatest valentine's gift that's better than chocolate and dozens of roses--a boyfriend that i love and treasure.  :)|`|bC5RfHUpaa	Happy Valentine's Day!!

db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I bought 2 dresses on Ebay.  The first was NWT and I LOVE it!  I paid $125.  The tag says it was 700.  And I received it in 3 business days.  Only buy from someone with a positive feedback just in case... <br>  <br>  The other dress I bought for $86 and I don't like it.  I resold it on Ebay for $200!!!!  So I got my money back.  I had a good experience.  It's not someone who is very very picky though.<br>  <br>  I had also tried on dresses at local bridal shops in my area (David's Bridal, Alfred Angelo's and one more) so I had an idea of what my size was and what style I liked on my body.<br>  <br>  I also asked for additional pictures of the dress to calm my nerves.|`|rI7J9M8taa	Your best chance of success buying a wedding gown on Ebay is to find one being sold by an individual bride.  Unfortunately, the majority of wedding gowns on Ebay are cheap knock-offs of designer gowns.  They use copyrighted pictures and do the best they can remaking those gowns but what you end up with are crooked seams and zippers and glued on sequins and poorly made flowers.  Have you looked into bridal consignment stores?|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Each eBay seller has different policies on returns, etc. I would reserach the seller and ask about the return policies before you bid, then you will know. I would never buy a dress without trying it on first, but that's just me. I would look around your local Craigslist, Goodwill and thrift stores as well, then you get to see the product before you buy. Also, some bridal shops have clearance dresses. And, look into having your dress made. My mom (whose been making wedding gowns and formalwear for ~40 years now) charges $35 to $175 for a wedding gown based on the style and fabric the bride chooses. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GAP0qzI9aa	I had a tight budget too. I searched for a long time to find a wedding dress. I was nervous about to buy the dress online. Then I got my wedding dress from royalty bridal. All my family and friend said it was a really nice wedding dress. It did not cost too much. I loved it. Maybe you can try it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Hahahaha.|`|eeGN977eaa	My parents are still in love. They have been married for 29 years and the seem to be more in love now than they were when I was growing up.

8CL8o8K0aa	Speak naturally and smile while talking.  It goes across as a pleasant voice.  If you are humorous or have a good science of humor it will come naturally.  Just be yourself.|`|zBSPaC70aa	Imagine you're actually talking face-to-face with the other person. If you make a joke, you should really smile. Just smile a lot and you'll automatically sound really happy.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about a low voice, worry about talking too loud- that's kind of tacky.|`|22A698zsaa	1, 2, and 3. Be yourself. If you have a jolly personality - it will be known. Try to get over your nerves before you get into the phone conversation and just resolve that you will act as naturally as possible - if you aren't yourself then you're giving a fake person to the world, and then you may realize that the world the fake person is in doesn't make YOU happy. In other words, if you aren't yourself, you may get placed in a situation that will never make you happy. To not worry about being boring, throw in interesting questions yourself like "What was your favorite thing you did today?" or you could prevent the conversation from lasting long enough for them to find out you're boring by ending the conversation when you're done. Also, "low" voices are relative to people's opinions, so just don't even worry about that part.|`|hh14cdtMaa	sound excited when u hear there voice.hi/ HI.gargle with salt, lemon,and a tad bit of vodka.practice,practice. think of things to ask him throughout the day and write them down so you do not forget.

Maybe you should move on, so she can get a better guy.|`|gUaXZPYmaa	thats not too much of an age difference, tell her how you feel first, dont worry about her getting mad since if you left her anyways shed still be mad. also how serious is this relationship? 2 years or more? keep in mind what you want out of your relationship, are you willing to comprimise?|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	Now you see, you're going straight for looks. You shouldn't just go for looks alone. Do you have a good relationship? Don't let a few gray hairs get you. Plus you're being a jerk for thinking of doing such a thing.<br>  <br>  P.S. Gray hairs at 29? I've never seen that before.|`|VYaweDIVaa	you should just dump her if you want go with your heart|`|UmidemI6aa	If you are even thinking about dumping your girlfriend because of her looks, then do it.  Don't waste her time.  Your relationship sounds that it is all based upon looks.  It's not love, its lust.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	She should dump you for someone better.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	well telling her she looks too old for you is just plain mean. it may be her appearance that is putting you off but really all it means is that the spark has gone out of the relationship, so tell her that, and don't go out with someone else straight away, it'll be a rebound relationship and will be a disaster tbh. if you don't wanna be with ur gf anymore then tell her asap and enjoy being single for a while. find somone who you can see yourself being with for the long term no matter what happens to either of you (aging and what not (: lol )  <br>  <br>  hope it helps (: x|`|58e1b1e10dbc48a33c1c0667b5fac25faa	I assume you're joking.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	if your really love her, then that won't matter.<br>  But if you are actually considering dumping her just cause she's getting older then she doesn't deserve a guy like you.  <br>  Your gonna get old too ya know, it happens to everyone, what if you dump her for a 20 year old and then go out for a while, ya know that she's gonna age too.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Yes, give her a shot at landing a good man.|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	Maybe she should ditch you for a REAL MAN! JERK!|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You are a jerk if you do something like that.  If you are truly that shallow, however, then breaking up with your girlfriend would be a good thing.  I'm sure she can do better, and deserves more.|`|IVuFzRTNaa	well obviously you dont love her enough to see through her flaws. True Love Is UNCONDITIONAL! i guess ur gonna dump her any way.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	dont tell her shes too old looking for you jack ***. if your so concerned about her being so much older why did you start going out with her in the first place? grow up|`|8SN7KiCkaa	Ok so do I think you are superficial and shallow, yes... <br>  <br>  But if you cant stand the sight of her, then please do not be with her out of pity. That is ridiculous...<br>  <br>     You know that it will break her heart when you do leave her, because we ALL know that this question shows what your really wanting to do...<br>      But think about how much more it will break her heart to find out you dont enjoy gazing at her, and that you dont like the person she is on the inside.<br>  <br>    So do i think you should leave, yes, but it is NOT for your sake. It is for the well being of the woman you are currently with, whom you dont really love.|`|AA11991028	you not married so no. well unless you have been dating her for a long time.|`|2S2onP86aa	24? What the hell are you doing with a 29 year old woman? Get yourslf a younger girl. Live your youth. I never recommend young guys dating older women; it creeps me out. It's more natural to be with a younger girl.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and ignore those who tells you that you are heartless, because you aren't. You deserve to live your life with a young girl, similar to your age; a bit younger or same age. Other than that, no.<br>  <br>  Keep your head up ?|`|lFzFtiCBaa	if its something you cant live with then do what feels right to and for you.|`|gXG3bRwaaa	ur a fu c k ing JERK<br>  <br>  ugh, jeez guys like u piss me off<br>  <br>  i hope ur pee pee shrivels and she rips ur balls off<br>  <br>  jerk.|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	i think thats its rude that you wanna dump yer gf cause she looks older. what about when yer older, do you think shes gunna think the same about you???? Gosh your such a pig, along with most of the guys in america!!!! you really need to grow up and realize that people arent perfect, they have imperfections, and you got to live with what you got! for example: she has you...she could do better......your such a frikin pig!!!!!!!!|`|f75x8aI3aa	Yes,get over it. Your be ageing soon as well my lovely. If the grey hairs really do bug you so much, why not pay for her to get her hair done, she could get it coloured and you wouldn't know they were they, plus she'll be grateful for you treating out of the blue...?

Shes probably smarter than you, so watch it.|`|lI0UsOpyaa	are you sure you really love her? in the nicest way possible, this doesnt sound like love. when you love someone, something like gray hairs wouldnt even cross your mind as bothersome. sit down and think if you really strongly love her, because my friend, it will only go downhill from here. shes going to get older, and youre going to have to face it. but so will you! whats going to happen when the younger girl is repulsed by your aging! sit down and have some quiet time with yourself, and think things over. do you really see this girl in your future? only you can answer these types of questions. good luck and i hope everything works out. and do me a favor, if you do decide to break it off, pleaseeee dont tell her it was because her getting old was starting to repulse you. god bless! =]|`|KhzUSGrXaa	Well the younger the women are the LESS EXPERIENCED they are in all areas of life. I feel sorry for you though because you are obviously very immature and have an extremely simplistic and superficial nature. Being happy is  important though, so it's your call but I'd advise you to never grow a gray hair, get wrinkles or fatten up - after all that's all yuk, and what woman would want to deal with that.|`|92HoC2OWaa	dont be a jackass u will get old 2 1 day just buy her hair dye and put it in a regular shampoo bottel or buy color stoping pantine <br>  DO NOT DUMP HER! <br>  i repeat do not dump her!|`|YFXusnT1aa	How about if she dumps you for someone more mature|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	i am sorry ut if you feel that way about her then u don't deserve her, just because she is getting a little older doesn't mean u should just drop her like trash! Obviously you don't like her anymore just because of her looks? that is shallow i am sorry but that makes me mad. and you know what i bet if you dump her and go for someone younger they aren't going to be what you think. i mean i cant tell you to or not to dump her i don't even know you but i can tell you that you are making the wrong decision and you are probably regret it.|`|K1Lk7BXhaa	Yes, it would be wrong|`|bC8r2YTCaa	don't tell her!! that is so mean and it would be bad for her emotional... if u really love her stay with her if not then leave but don't tell her you are leaving her cause she is old .....|`|jGe0raA3aa	It is absolutely wrong but you should break up with your girlfriend and tell her it is because you are a pig.

Who cares about the gray hair. If it is honestly a problem for you maybe you don't truly love her. Sorry to sound so mean but maybe you have some faults some people may see in you but your girlfriend doesn't think so because she loves you and the appearance doesn't matter.<br>  My boyfriend loves me no matter what. He tells me it doesn't matter if I have pimples all over my face or that fact I have auburn hair instead of blonde or if I never had any hair, if it was short or long or even gray, or the fact that I'm a little bit shorter than others, or that I am rather muscular than most girls. It doesn't matter. When you truly love someone they shouldn't have to change to meet what may be your "requirement" to be your girlfriend- which seems to be youthfulness and perfection.<br>  I'm not trying to be mean. Just think about what you are saying and think about how much you care about your present girlfriend.<br>  Some have different answers for your question.<br>  Your going to have to answer this one by your own reasoning. I hope this helps your question|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	Yes it would be wrong. She's only 5 years older than you and your minimum age limit is 5 years younger than you , so you might be the one getting gray hairs and getting dumped.|`|1uRPYZ4Raa	i think if u love her you should stay with your girlfriend, but if your starting to think of her as innatrctive you can tell her that|`|nk7a56ipaa	yes ..its time for a trade in for sure ..a 29 year old is getting old. 19-23 is a perfict age .. go for it,,, dont wait  until its to late|`|SZvJVM2yaa	its all bout you buddy what ever floats your boat why not keep both and enjoy a lil bit of both after all you are a man aren't you you do as you please and see fit|`|PiF42aaOaa	she deserves someone better than you.
p98iQcWUaa	oh sweetie, it sounds like you have it pretty rough at home. People say that there is no place like home, and that no one will ever treat you as good as they do at home...but in some cases that's just not true. I was in your shoes when i was 17 too...I waited untill i turned 18, and moved out. I'm not gonna lie, it was really hard to find a good job and support myslef. But now i have my own apt, new car, and have a great job...but im 20. It wassent easy, and it wassent a big party either. you have to start slow and work and its not going to get better over night. I think you should try to get any job right now and save as much as possible. Keep your head up girl...everything will workout soon enough. : )|`|OTTZyCKuaa	girl! what the hell are you waiting for! tell someone DUHH<br>  u wanna die or something? geezus tell your counselor at school what is going on at home or talk to someone dont just sit there and let them treat you like a fuxing dog or toy!!|`|eus7WqzUaa	Call social services...like now!<br>  <br>  NO one should live that that!<br>  <br>  Google "social services" and put a +then your zip code|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Wait till your 18 and move out.
jRSzIzYqaa	Yes. All girls look at you and think- he's quite and shy and I want to date him and cheat on him then be pals. That's exactly how we think. You nailed it. <br>  <br>  No. You picked the wrong girl. Big deal. It happens and it sucks for a little while but there are other girls out there looking for nice guys. You might have trust issues for a while but you just need to get back out there and find the right girl.|`|X6hK915Naa	your boring girls want excitement in there life and your just not giving it to them ecspecially if your shy....be more of a daredevil keep her guessing about what your gonna do today....hope that helped<br>  DAREDEVIL  T

And My advice is do what i did with my dad and forget, as he obviously has yet he may be feeling the same as you if hes ignoring you dont try and make contact just leave him when he wants to talk he will x<br>  Give him time x<br>  Good Luck I hope You Speak Soon xxx|`|XPYR2gq1aa	How old is he?   Sometimes you have to be the one to reach out, especially since your are the older one!  This same thing happened to me and my bro (minus the heart ****) and he is still distant but as he is growing up he wants to hang around more.  Just let him know you care about him and you would like to see him and then the ball is in his court.  If he decides to act right, then great, if not you cannot force it!  Just face the fact that your bro is cold and keep trying to talk to him until you cannot take it anymore.  But its not fair for you to expect him to jump when you say after no talking from either of you for so long.  I would have at least called tho.....|`|ZOvJLl5eaa	YOU think im imagining this while story up?? not this story mine the one u answerd.

5hgN3Zyoaa	I totally agree with you both.Some time in life a stage comes where only because of few misunderstandings,communication gap,overlooking likes and dislikes of you partner this type of separation happen.you discuss all this very clearly with her and make a note of every comment from her. Give her a chance to clear her heart. I am sure that she still  loves you and you can develop a better understanding.Just give another chance to flourish it as again like never before.You can remind her all that happiness you have shared in past and how much she mean to you,go for date to the places where you often use to meet before marriage and its all done. Don't worry..|`|HAk6iROaaa	Your problems have not occured because it was a love marriage, it's because there is probably a lack of communication. If you had, then you would have realized her expectations and knowing you could possibly not fulfill them, then would not have married. Don't blame LOVE marriages and don't condemn divorce if YOU are not communicating effectively. The solution is TALK, I mean REALLY talk. Don;'t talk at her, engage, communicate, make eye contact. Be honest 100% and then you will see what is REALLY going on.<br>  <br>  <br>  "joining two mind and body for the rest of life" And this is the biggest misconception/misunderstanding of life. How people can commit to "forever" is beyond me.

Here goes. My ex would sometimes be the same way. It was almost like he couldn't "do it" as good as he wanted to without a little bit of fore-play. I personally can do with out it and can live with not giving. But SOME men, get used to it so to speak, and seem to not be able to live without it. The next boyfriend I got- I told him I wouldn't do that for him and if I did it would have to be his birthday. He didn't like that much. But he got over it.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	His expectations of you is what makes him feel frustrated *. It's very immature of him, and is not something I would consider to be loving behaviour on his part. What you offer him that way, isn't something he should expect. It should be a 'gift' as sex is supposed to be an expression of love.<br>  <br>  He needs to learn to own his feelings and stop blaming you.<br>  <br>  * It's not anger, it's frustration. The difference is that he expects this from you, when he doesn't get what he expects, he gets frustrated, then verbally aggressive. Anger is different in that it is a ego defence mechanism.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	Not everybody likes oral sex. Nothing is wrong withyou if you don't. Or maybe you're just not used to it, and not ready to do it as often as your boyfriend wants. <br>  If he is a good boyfriend, you can explain to him that you would like to do it--and receive it--less often.|`|le29yexraa	He's being a jerk. Using a bit more teeth might dissuade him from bothering you so much about it...|`|reNnLWh4aa	basically men are big babies and blow jobs are their candy... thats it. its just that simple.|`|KSUksBZkaa	if you aren't comfortable with it then tell him. if he really respects you [sounds like he doesn't] then he will be ok with it. if he isn't then he shouldn't try to make you feel bad for it or get mad at you. that's called emotional abuse. a guy should NEVER EVER get mad at you or make you feel bad for not doing something because you are uncomfortable with it. if he gets mad then forget him. it will just get worse with time and it will be other things later [not necessarily sexual]. if he doesn't respect you, he doesn't deserve you.|`|2eztcCO0aa	There's a difference between oral sex and a b*** j**.  Remember that a b*** j** is servicing him; he doesn't have to do anything but enjoy it while you do all the work and get nothing in return.  It's okay on occasion, but if he wants it very regularly, then he's being a jerk.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is mutual and leads to sex, which you can both enjoy. It's not unreasonable to want this most of the time.<br>  <br>  So tell him that you don't mind oral sex, but no more b*** j**s.|`|Pj85ehE1aa	First off Erinn, you should NEVER be expected to perform sexual favors for your significant other.  I don't think you are doing anything wrong at all.  If you are uncomfortable doing it then DON'T.  if he gets mad that you are uncomfortable doing it, kick him to the curb.  Get your "experience" elsewhere with someone who is patient with you and willing to learn together.  Sex is not a one person experience.   Talk it out with him and learn exactly what his expectations are and if YOU are willing to meet them.  It's not all about him.|`|s1pC35Seaa	Guys like sex. Guys like sexual things. He probably just gets cranky because he's not getting his "fix" per se. He may be impatient or just a sex fiend, but you need to talk to him about it. I would ask him and be honest and truthful, you don't want to hide stuff from him.|`|pwXK9A4haa	practice makes perfect. if he thought you weren't good he wouldn't ask for it. tell him about your comfort level. but honestly, the better you get at it the more you'll want to do it. two years is a good amount of time to be together. good for you guys|`|eZ884HfPaa	You need<br>  To become comfortable with your sexuality learn to talk about it with your partner.  He will respect you for that and don't be shy about it.  It's natural|`|KcXiM61Yaa	i personally think he's just with you because you're the only girl who is willing to preform these sexual acts on him. the other girls won't sink down to his level, to preform oral 3-4 times a week. your boyfriend just wants the instand pleasure he gets out of you. <br>  <br>  if you are umcomfortable with doing it, DON'T DO IT! why are you forcing yourself to do these things? i mean, you're not trying to satisfy him. a relationship is a give and take situation, and you're just giving HIM stuff. what does he give you ? (not sexual stuff). i personally think you can do a LOT better than this.|`|lHjXeN8oaa	all guys like oral sex... it is hard to get "good" at it without practice.  if you are having trouble, try spraying choroseptic  (okay so i don't know how to spell it... but that spray you use for a sore throat) in your mouth before you do it.  it numbs your throat and makes things go easier.  :)  I hope that helps you... <br>  <br>  if it is more of an issue of how often as opposed to being able to do it easily then just explain to him that you are willing to do it occasionally and find something else that he enjoys a lot to fill in the blanks.  :)|`|90aff9e8e410604f2804bafe086c61eeaa	Your boyfriend should never get "so mad" at you for anything you feel uncomfortable doing intimately - no matter what reason you have.<br>  <br>  An intimate relationship can only be successful if both partners are enjoying themselves and are comfortable with one another. Him liking oral sex is something to consider when you are having sex, but you shouldn't do favors for him out of guilt or fear he'll be angry.<br>  <br>  Talk to your boyfriend. Explain to him that his demands on you are making you uncomfortable and let him know what he can expect from you in regards to oral sex. Will it be occasional? Will it be something you want to do on your terms, when you want to? Are you okay with him requesting it without pressure? And, if this is a temporary thing and you are willing to reconsider your perspective and/or boundaries in the future let him know that too. Consider you may feel a little more comfortable with it if you feel you are good at it? Maybe reading up on some tactics will improve your esteem in the matter - should that be something you are willing to do.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, be with someone who makes you feel good doing the things you enjoy. Don't tolerate anyone pressuring you into ANYTHING.|`|kPl1SJ1Aaa	He should never never never get MAD at you for not doing it or EXPECT it, like its your duty.<br>  <br>  Its a fun way to pleasure a man, but if you feel uncomfortable or its not your favorite thing to do (some women even think its pretty gross), then say so and let him get mad.<br>  <br>  If you repsect yourself, he will respect you too. This is a deeply personal issue and you have a right to say how you feel.<br>  <br>  Sex is fun, not something he should get mad about.<br>  <br>  And, if you are uncomfortable, but want to be more "experienced", ask him to tell you what feels good and doesnt.<br>  <br>  (Honey, its a myth about experience and technique. Use your hand and your mouth, they love it.) :)
u0udwkZQaa	Guys are really horny, it's always on their mind, or just about to come into their mind. All you have to do is look at him straight in the eyes and when he notices, keep the look for a few seconds. He will straight away think, "that girl likes me". Then it's upto him to make a move. If he doesn't and is shy, you can just position yourself near him one day by accident, and ask a general question/for help on something, or ask someone near him/he's talking to, then say the same thing to him. If you've done all these things and he still hasn't done anything he is either so shy you'll need to do everything, or, he's not on the market for whatever reason.|`|DKGiGbxGaa	Just tell him how you feel about him|`|q3UiNyDdaa	Just go ahead and tell him. You don't have to just walk up to him and blurt it out, talk to him for a minute, alone, and try to work it in there. If the whole subtlety thing isn't working for you, go ahead and just tell him. But don't tell him that you won't mind if he doesn't like you, just say that you like him and see how he reacts.|`|43D89edDaa	Tell him that you'll miss him when he moves.<br>  <br>  Tell him "So you are moving in the summer? then say, that sucks because I was totally going to ask you out that summer!" <br>  <br>  That would get me to smile if I was in his shoes. You gots this.|`|SVk5t3Klaa	you can start out by pulling him aside and telling him how much he's helped you... stay really positive... then thank him... this would be a great time to ask him "will you be my boyfriend?" or whatever you choose to say|`|RiStkJT9aa	just start talking and get to know him and then you just say "i like you do you like me?"<br>  answe mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnJWzAULM9Ck4QRA_7jtURvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224233711AAISTfY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|219Mkbtqaa	Don't say the I like you, do you like me? That will end up awkward and terrible. <br>  <br>  Have you two been friends for a while?? If so, then definitely tell him you will miss him when he moves.  Truthfully, don't expect things to work out long distance-y relationship wise.  It's difficult, especially being a teenager.  Let him know that you care about him and he's some one you won't forget.  Maybe he'll get the hint?? <br>  As for doing something for him...I say make him something crafty.<br>  -Get a box and put different things in it that are inside jokes between you two.

You can also give him a present before he goes. Tell him that you should hang out more since it is your last couple months seeing eachother. He might give you some suggestions or you could ask him what he would like to do before he leaves. If you do this he will know you care about him enough and then you can show him by flirting a little when you actually hang out.<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226210957AA97YCj&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

Take a backwards step from him at work and act purely professionally.|`|vYt8KQRMaa	aww. im sorry. i guess the best thing to do is tell him how you feel and just see his reaction|`|Pd9hGj5Baa	Tell him how you feel.

Ff7mCzlPaa	I think that some fat people have an "illness" -- no one wants to get huge.  But some people have insatiable appetites, or always feel hungry, even if they just ate.  <br>  <br>  A few years back i read theories on this and science believed it may have something to do with a hormone.  I can believe it, because no one can be comfortable or have very good self-esteem if they are terribly overweight.  Other times, i believe over-eating can be the result of emotional problems and people eat too much for comfort, so this would be considered an eating disorder..<br>  <br>  Fat women look at thin girls and are ENVIOUS -- don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  I look at girls who are too thin as possibly having an eating disorder (it can  go both ways!)|`|UDInHk0jaa	It is called being overweight!!!

aXHo1Xeaaa	If you have grown attached and you very much love the daughter, stay in her life. How do you think you would feel in your girlfriends place? She was probably terrified to tell you because her baby needed a father figure, but she couldnt wait any longer. Also think about it, how do you think she would feel if you walked out on her? Try to be a father to this baby, but if you think it isnt your responsibility, or you cant take it, then leave, but don't start calling names.|`|L44LBa2Xaa	Keep loving your daughter like she was yours.<br>  It doesn't matter if your the father or not, but if you truly love this baby, then stay.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You can either continue the arrangement and keep the relationship going, or you can kick them to the curb.

cB2VGhLgaa	Omg I know exactly how you feel!! I'm having a problem deciding what to do for school (im in high school too). heres what i tried... i looked at my options and tried to figure out which one would be best for me. in ur case you should ask yourself if you'll be happy when you move all the way back to your old school or if you should stick it out at ur new school. but since ur schools so far away you should really think about it b4 you do it. <br>  if you really hate where you are now and you dont think that will ever change, then you should move. but if theres any chance you might be ok where you are then try to stay :)|`|2KC467tFaa	I hated high school until my senior year. I transferred to another school in my town. I had nothing to lose. It was my last year. I was social and unafraid of everything. I loved it! I opened up and made a ton of friends. If you feel like there isn't anything to lose, you will free yourself and be able to be exactly who you are. Join an after school program. Take a chance. If it backfires, change schools and start again. Don't leave until you know it won't work out. It sounds like you're just in an uncomfortable environment. There's nothing to be afraid of. High school doesn't last forever.|`|tZReiFF2aa	You want to go back into the past and live there. But you are here in the present and have to accept things as they are. Be present in your life. It is your life after all. Find new friends to be with. You are not unwanted it is just that you are giving this aura of "stay away" because that is what you want other people to do. Stop doing this and everything will be fine. Find the good things in your life right now and really cherish them.|`|W1euPMsNaa	If you were to move back to your own school it would mean basically abandoning your family which is one of of the main people you need in your life at that age, There are always ways in which you can gain friends at your new school all you need to do is push your way into friendship groups who have the same interests as yourself. Being on your own at school is no life and without friends your future will just go down.<br>  <br>  In my opinion I would try they same school for a couple more months and try and gain status within the year group, because in every school everyone has one person with the same interests and opinions. Don't change your interests thoughts and opinion just to gain friends if you do not gain friends after about 4 months change school but that should be your FINAL OPTION because families are your friends and are the only people you can trust in this world so if you were to move stay in touch with your family they are must more important, <br>  <br>  Stay Strong, don't just ignore people you don't get friends by not speaking to them you must be confident in what you love!
1F6ZnYtXaa	For me staying REALLY busy helps. Going out with friends even though I really did not want to actually helps. I would complain the entire time while getting ready, but once I was there I had a great time. Find a person that loves you and that you trust to hash out some of the pent of anger and feelings you have. Its ok to be sad. You gave your entire being to someone, so it will take time to completley detach. Live your life to the fullest, and reconnect with your true self- do things that YOU enjoy doing. In the end, you will become a happier and better person and you will eventually find someone who you are compatible with and will always think of you before his selfish needs.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Go get laid.  It really is what works best.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	First of all, I know it sounds cliche but it is true, it takes time.  My husband left after 27 yrs and I too was devastated. Right now you need to lean on family and friends when you feel blue.  Stay so busy that you don't have time to think about him and when you do find yourself thinking of him force yourself to think of something else.  Before you know it, you will be thinking of him less and less and you will be smiling more and more.  Good Luck and just take your time.<br>  Red|`|FtyLwqR5aa	You said on and off again, so you must have known it was coming to an end. this break up can't hurt as much as the first one did.

Definitely stay away, that's a really bad decision to make at this time.<br>  <br>  Some better suggestions are surrounding yourself with friends, even if it's just seeing one friend every night or so, it helps. I did it after my divorce, I worked hard to pack my schedule, so that I wouldn't sit thinking about it. That hurts, and it doesn't help the situation at all.<br>  <br>  Another option is, indeed, going out there and getting you some. lol. Make sure that you're honest with yourself about the situation, as well as the other person(Trust me, most guys won't be deterred by this, lol). Don't let it turn into a rebound. If you've been in that relationship off and on for six years, you need to wait at least six months before letting the word 'love' come out of your mouth again. But yes, this kind of indulgence can feel very good, it can restore your self confidence, and frankly, anything that builds your self esteem, that makes you feel attractive, wanted, or worthwile is VERY significant. Just don't let yourself get too caught up in a need for that.<br>  <br>  Avoid too many american films, you'll find that most of them have some running theme of love in them, and that won't help. Unfortunately, a lot of music seems to have those themes as well, we're a very love-centric country as entertainment goes.<br>  <br>  Live shows are advisable, comedians, or local music are probably a safe bet(How often do you pay attention to the lyrics when the concert is that loud?)<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Surround yourself with other things, positive things and people. Don't give yourself time to be sad. Remind yourself of all the good things, and of your self-worth, and in time you will heal.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	If you never contact him, you will feel better a lot sooner rather than later. LOOK FORWARD and do not look back. It is hard to do but when you start to do it, you will begin to grow stronger. Try to take good care of yourself and treat yourself to something. Don't do it because of him just do it because of all that energy you had/have to love now belongs all back to you. Know that you are not alone.

My answer to the first question is that guys with sweaty hands are not a turn-off to me at all. I wouldn't feel uncomfortable holding hands with them.  Second one : I think 16 is too young to have a girlfriend. Is your friend shy also?  When I was 16 I was also super-shy.  My now-best friend helped me come out of my shell a lot.  She is not shy.  So becoming best friends with someone who isn't shy may work for you as it did for me. <br>  <br>  Now, about this girl you like......You really should try talking to her.  Tell her what you wrote above in your story.  If you can't bring yourself to do it in person, why not get her screen name on an instant messenger?  Maybe your friend that knows her could get that set up i.e. tell her that you really want to tell her something but are too shy to do it in person.<br>  <br>  On another note, don't let your sweaty hands ruin your confidence!  You feel like it is a turn-off to people just like some ugly people may feel that their looks are a turn-off to people.  This world is full of people who have what some people consider to be turn-offs.  But you know what?  Some of these people, depending on their attitudes, are happy, successful, popular, and even influential people!  What I'm trying to say, I suppose, is that these people ARE accepted by society when they don't let their "turn-off" affect their personality or mind.  All that really matters in this world is your inside. That's what is going to make you happy and make people like you and look up to you.  I know it's tough for you right now because of the immaturity of kids your age but when you get into college, it'll be a lot easier because that's when the immaturity is almost all gone.  That's when teens realize what I just told you : What you look like (or do, like a nervous habit or certain outer conditions you might have, like yours) doesn't matter!  It doesn't buy happiness and power or success.......your mind, personality, and attitude does.<br>  <br>  It WILL help you a lot to forget about the fact that your hands get sweaty when you're nervous.  I mean completely.  Don't ever think about it - it really is unimportant.  Being aware of it (look up "aware") will only cause you low self-confidence and maybe a bit of self-loathing.  It's a waste of your time to think about it.  This approach, the not-thinking-about-it approach, worked for me!  I have quite pale skin and I used to get teased from elementary school through about freshman year in high school because of it.  I found not thinking about to be a HUGE relief to me.  I learned to not think about anymore, reasoning that it's not important.  I think that forgetting about it discouraged potential teasers.  If people see that you are confident, they are actually more likely to like you!  I learned this AND heard it from a reliable source so it is true.  <br>  <br>  I'm telling you, self-confidence will go a LONG way. People will respect you when they SEE that you are self-confident.....another fact that I learned.<br>  <br>  I really really hope you will take my advice to heart.  You can instant message or e-mail me if you want any more advice, or just want someone to talk to.  You sound like a nice person.|`|mOxVL0luaa	hey lift urself up again, stop be so negative.bare in mind that no human is perfect so don't blame it on ur sweaty hand instead u should do some work with ur charisma. try to put away ur fear and go head on say hi to a girl and eventually u will get use to it. Note : this is not flirting. talk to urself in front of the mirror. think of the positive outsome instead of sitting of the corner burst ur own bubbles. BE CONFIDENT IN EVERY ASPECT OF UR LIFE!!
HqcH85SMaa	My mum made my wedding dress and it meant more to me than any shop dress that all look similar. They are all strapless here in Australian shops. Go for it - make it.|`|4POGapREaa	You was talking about it?  Nice.|`|l43NSgHyaa	You need to weigh the pros and cons.  Which is going to be more beneficial in the long run?    In some cases, it's cheaper to make a dress.   However, that doesn't mean in every case.  You can probably make a dress that equal or more in price than something in the store.  Then, you have to factor in the time it takes to make the dress.  Is it worth all the effort?  If you're really busy, it might be more convenient to buy a dress from a store. <br>  <br>  Weigh your pros and cons.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	The only way that I would make my own gown is if it was an extremely simple design with very little structure.  I wouldn't want to work on silk satin.  I'd want it to be the kind of gown that wouldn't require expert tailoring, either.<br>  <br>  If you have figure issues that you feel make it an advantage to create at home, then it makes sense.  If you think you'll end up paying a thousand dollars for a simple style that you could make for under one hundred dollars, then make it at home.<br>  <br>  If you are wearing a veil, be sure to make that if you can.  You can save some serious money making those.|`|AA10722993	Unless your mom is an experienced seamstress, I wouldn't attempt making your wedding dress.   Working with bridal fabrics requires more than average skill, and it is not something to learn on!    If you don't want to buy the dress, maybe you could find someone to make it for you.  There are a lot of women who make wedding and bridesmaid's dresses.   <br>  <br>  However, if your mom has had experience making prom dresses, she could probably do a good job on a wedding dress.|`|XawBWMQraa	Which ever is more affordable. This is just a one time wear, even though its a goign to be special. If you could find a dress you like, why go thru the hassle of making it.|`|9UpKxA1yaa	My mom made hers and it was gorgeous. I think handmade dresses can be nice. As long as you have the time and patience to do it yourself, I think it is a valid idea. And one of you should be pretty good at sewing. This probably isn't something to take on if you have just started to learn how to sew.<br>  <br>  I bought mine. The main reason is because I can't sew. My mom is making the cake and already doing so much for the wedding, I didn't want to ask her to make it.|`|vyL7yEleaa	it really depends on what you are looking at for a wedding dress. if you are looking for a lot of bling making it yourself could be very very expensive. <br>  <br>  if you are looking for something simple and elegant you could easily have it done at home for a lot less. <br>  <br>  but personally i bought mine just because after looking around for so long for a dress i found the perfect one by mori lee and i could not believe the quality of the dress.. it doesn't wrinkle and it is so sturdy i am not afraid of it tearing.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	well, if u mean BUY it by PAY it.....<br>  well, if you or your mother is a Fashion Designer a really good one then make the dress.<br>  if not...<br>  It's better for you to buy it, you will find lots of options and the right one will catch ur eye..<br>  <br>  good luck.. &<br>  Congrats :)|`|YzhZCs3Naa	If you're experienced, go for it! At least you'll know it's one of a kind :)<br>  <br>  If you're not too confident about it, it might be better to buy one|`|rXvePmfgaa	OMG u should really buy one, making ur own wedding dress would take alot of work and u should be experience cuz u dnt want ur wedding dress to look...... u know?|`|xqPaId52aa	Your doing the right thing. You should pay a  wedding dress

And if she says mean things about it or bothers you continuously about it- she's not a true friend. So just don't worry about it and laugh it off and for the first few days or so, keep reminding her about it and make her laugh. But then, eventually she might forget about it. This has happened to me before. It was funny- but my friend kept making fun of me so I realized she wasn't a real friend so guess what? I guess I could say we *broke up*. Like friendship wise.|`|8LBIeeomaa	well trust me...if you forget about and act like nothing  has happened..she will forget it too...she might even think if it actully happened or was it just some rubbish!!|`|gAP9PCTFaa	Fart really loudly and she will soon forget about the booger!|`|fLMc72q4aa	I'm sure if you just forget it you're friend will too!|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	lol she's not gonna forget.. you should bring it up casually.. laugh it off haha. just say, man, did you see that thing?? haha|`|pNWhcjJ7aa	Lmao .. if thats your fRiend you shouldnt be embarrssed to Lauqh & make a joke about it .. ya digggg ?

Some girl actually did that when i was a kid. I was that shy. then she broke up with me because i was afraid of her. lol. hopefully he's not that bad.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Well a simple way is to watch ihis body language when he is near you. If his feet point toward you when you talk, if he leans toward you while talking, if he comes out of no where to say hi, then those are some signs. Also get close to him like bump into him, and like get in his personal space bubble. If he doesn't move then he likes you.|`|KRhNkqBoaa	Well my shy guy likes to poke and tickle me all the time, but when my friends embarrass me he defends me. Yes he is a little immature, but i luv him all the same. It depends on how mature ur shy cutie is. I also had a friend who was a bit more mature and he would defend me and walk me home and he would also be a bit of a show off. So keep that in mind and if ur Still not sure ask some friends to slyly ask him. my friends do that all the time even though i didn't want them to.|`|UgJtnut4aa	Smile and be nice! you got to work at him and get him to open up!<br>  FIGHT!|`|MFHSzGh1aa	he will keep looking at you in a certain way like in a daydreaming way.|`|beGWUssPaa	If you can't confront him to his face then check out his myspace or facebook.  Chat with him that way.  Its less stressful because there are no nerves.  Its so cute that you guys are so shy but seriously say something sometime.  You will feel better. I met a guy at work that I was too shy to talk to so I got on myspace and sent him a message and he was like so excited to hear from me. We dated for like 2 months after that. Then he got boring but thats just me.  Give it a try.|`|WJWs8qiSaa	Well, even if this may be a big step... try talking to him. if hes to shy to answer then give him a little room to loosen up. so you think he likes you? then he will come around at some point. trust me i have been in the position before, and they all come around. (:|`|bVqeoOB0aa	He Talks to you a lot<br>  He's a bit personal<br>  He follows you in the hall|`|4a9Fso8Jaa	i think u should show that u like him too. Don't need so strong.

zYf8YL06aa	sure go ahead and tell her that you would be willing to teach her to play the guitar.  <br>  <br>  start it somewhat like this,<br>  <br>  hey, btw, that day when you told me that you didnt know how to play the guitar, i had something on my mind and forgot to ask if you wnated to learn to play.  if you want, i could teach you.<br>  <br>  it sounds very plausible and also not pushy.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|DsIbGLYUaa	good idea just talk about guitar and ask her if she ever thought about taking lessons, then you come in with your great idea|`|93e28c7a08b65069e3d97c485ab2a6fdaa	you dont need any help the wrong answer from a playa or something may have you lose her,just be casual,shes only human as yourself and be yourself,because if she doesnt like you for who you are youll be living in a lie ,and itll in the long run get all messed up.....so just do what you gatta do but be you doing it|`|wJMXQm3Waa	Well, for one it sounds like she likes you too. <br>  Just mention when you first learned how to play the guitar and who taught you and what song it was that you learned for the first time.<br>  Say "That would be pretty cool if we got together sometime and played the guitar, Do you know how to play any songs?"   She'll say "No......blah blah blah" Then you say "Ya know I could teach you how to play if you want!?"  And pick it up from there. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|eODQG80Uaa	If you really like her, just talk to her for a couple. if shes not interested YOU WILL KNOW lol. and don't wait to long just a couple more days and ask her, be like hey, remember that time you told me you didn't know how to play the guitar? i could show you some things if you'd like. she would probablly be very happy about you being completely honest. Go get her dude! lol.|`|k7OALQAhaa	Yes! She was dropping serious hints there! Of course you should ask her. She is most likely looking for an excuse to spend more time with you, and is disappointed you didn't come up with this idea earlier! It won't sound stupid or random because its exactly what shes looking for. Ask her, get to know her, and maybe this will lead somewhere.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tVrnhFGdaa	I would bring it up by saying something like 'hey I learned a new song' or if you write songs say 'hey I wrote a new song, I wish you could hear it and tell me what ya think.'  And go from there....|`|lQ2pLL2Yaa	maybe u can bring ur guitar to class again or randomly bring up the topic. then she might say that she wants to play and u can tell her youll teach her. or maybe try something else like just talking to her about random stuff and asking her questions about what she likes and stuff and then after awhile, you can ask her if she wants to hang out sometime. girls like when guys do that stuff. hope this helps.:)|`|Zzin0jCBaa	here is a way to bring the subject back up:<br>  <br>  1) Hey, I was wondering, have you ever taken guitar lessons?<br>  <br>  2) Or bring her some literature about guitar lessons and tell her you had been meaning to give it her. Also, add in that instead of paying, you can teach her for free. :-)|`|beGWUssPaa	Just say... "Hey, wanna come over and learn a song on my guitar?"  I can garantee that if she realy likes you she totally will. I guess if she says no at least you can say you had the balls to be  a man and ask! Either way you win!|`|V1KUBGrraa	go ahead n ask, but bring it up first, dont just go right out with the ? cuz then it would sound random.  get into a convo about it, n shell most likely say the same comment, giving you the opportunity again.|`|CDWf4eBxaa	lie, lie, and lie some more. trust me. it will work.<br>  <br>  <br>  no but seriously tell her your dick is as big as the guitar, even though it is probably as big as the pick.<br>  <br>  <br>  no but seriously, lie.|`|3Bw4e9Bvaa	well i would just ask her if she wants to go out to dinner or come over and hang out.....then while your out with her seemingly ask if she still wants lessons and then play guitar for her and MAKE YOUR MOVE MAN! good luck!|`|Dwea01UWaa	You pretty much just want to be yourself at all times. Be cool, and relax. Just simply bring it back up. It's no big deal. Just be like hey, (whatever her name is), remember the other day when I brought my guitar and you said it was cool and that you didn't know how to play? Well, I was wondering if maybe you wanted me to give you a lesson. Just be truthful. You can even mention that you wanted to ask her that day but you didn't know how to ask. JUST BE HONEST. Girls love a sensitive, honest guy. We even love to see a little sensitive side in the gangsta boys. Trust me, I know.|`|7aUG8lY1aa	Just say something along these lines: <br>  <br>  You: Hey remember I told you I got my guitar<br>  <br>  Girl: (most likely will say yes she does remember, if she doesn't tell her again)<br>  <br>  You: yeah well I've been practicing a bit and I could use some help. I heard you're really good at playing guitar yourself. So you be willing to help me a bit?<br>  <br>  Girl: (hopefully says yes sure she will)!!!<br>  <br>  Then let the conversation go from there! Good luck!!|`|ynj6I6Xsaa	I think you are past the hard part, you broke the ice. You should definitely ask her if she would like some lessons. She seemed interested enough to maybe take you up on your offer. You could maybe get to talking about music in general first, so your offer to teach her doesn't seem like it's coming out of nowhere.|`|D1xvJXdSaa	I think bringing up the guitar is a good idea, I mean it is at least something you know she has a interest in.  If you feel weird just bringing it up out of the blue then bring the guitar in again and bring it up then.|`|Iz8iHXViaa	sounds like what you really want is to spend time with her, or impress her huh? my best advise is to ask her to hang out outside of school. go to a movie or the mall. some one else said ask her if she want to come over so you can show her some stuff. <br>  <br>  try telling her how easy it is and how you could show her. but what every you say be sure you say it with confidence. that's the most important quality when it comes to most girls. ask her like you already know she will say yes. because she will. it already shows she likes you.<br>  <br>  and if when yall hang out it goes well then would be a good time to tell her you like her. always be honest with girls because they like that and they like talking about stuff.<br>  <br>  i had to hit and miss with alot of girls be for i really got my confidence and learned a little about them but if you don't try and get out of your Comfort zone then you will never know. and that's worse that anything. <br>  <br>  good luck buddy.
MWfWPunqaa	1. Smile a lot with him, sincerely...<br>  2. Investigate his favourite foods/drinks/colour/things......<br>  3. Look at him, and when he looked back, smile and look down<br>  4. Lend a help when you think he need a help<br>  5. When he shows a greenlight, keep it on!!!<br>  <br>  GOOOOOOOODLUCK!!! ='D|`|h8a5MWlTaa	ok this is gnna sound weird, but act like you hate him. well not hate him hate him, but just dont try to flirt with him for a while. if you play hard to get, you'll act like they cant have you. and if you act like that, that makes them want you even more. because guys always want what they cant have. :) good luck!
80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	They don't.<br>  <br>  The reason is they are tired of listening to their parents - who still (at times) treat them like little kids.  While they have their friends telling them how great everything would be if they only did xxx with them.<br>  <br>  The teenage years is the time kids start making their own decisions.  Sometimes, they make those decisions like they are still a child.  Other times, they get it right.  And still other times, they make it like a teenager - someone running fast on hormones and an eagerness to hurry up and get on with life while nothing bad can happen to them.  And they are tired of listening to their folks who are out of touch with the way things are today. <br>  <br>  I had lived by myself since age 21. I got married at 33 without ever having had a roommate.  Married a 39 year old woman who had 2 teenagers.    One 17 and one 13.  The son, age 13, was taller than I was (and I'm 6'-1" and 190 pounds).  Their Mom believed she needed to do everything for her kids.  I have a different view - that parents must be teachers (not just friends) and that by teaching the child - you can be surer that they will do okay when you are not around them.<br>  <br>  My mother-in-law keep interfering by saying that I needed to come in and lay the law down on the kids.  I knew that would only cause more adjustment problems.  When the son was going to a party once, he (almost insultingly) asked me "What rules do you have for me?  No smoking?  No drinking?"  (My thoughts - How can you have a rule for everything?  How can you enforce those rules?  How would anyone remember all of the rules needed? )<br>  <br>  I told him, "Just remember one thing - you are responsible for what you do.  Just like you would be if you were an adult."  That remark scared the $hit out of him.<br>  <br>  Now that the girl is 40 and her brother is 36, they joke that I was right.  But back then, they said I was the mean, old, step-father.<br>  <br>  Its like what Mark Twian wrote back in the 1800's "It was amazing what his father had learned in a few short years." Its not the parents that change in a few short years, it just that as the kids start to gain experience from making adult decisions on adult issues - they realize that the parents were not as dumb as they thought. <br>  <br>  My step-son (I hate that term) used to talk with his friends about he could hardly wait until he turned 16 and would be driving.  That they would take their guns and drive down the road shooting roadsigns.  (Grrr.)  I told him, if he did and he got caught he should tell the judge to bring me in.  He said "And you'll take care of it for me?"  I said "No, I going to wait until after the judge sentences you.  And then I going to tell him that I deserve the same punishment because I obviously  failed to teach you the difference between right and wrong."  He got a very strange look on his face.<br>  <br>  A couple of years later, he got caught riding in a car with him holding (drinking from a can of beer).  And the driver was drinking also.  He did not ask me to go to court with him.  He went with his friends who also got ticketed.  Some of them just paid fines.  But he didn't have the money.  So the judge sentenced him to work at a landfill.  When he came home from the landfill, he stopped on the back porch and asked for a garbage bag so he could throw away his clothes.  He took a big step forward in growing up on that day.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	This is really hard just keep on them and take away privileges and make sure their friends are close by having them over spend time with them whether they want you to or not and I know your sanity is being tested  but run off any kids you dont want them hanging out with and talk to them about no matter what it is they can tell you and if they are breaking your rules talk to the police about them breaking curfew I dont know your story but you can email me about it I raised three teenagers and survived it they are all great kids and they grew up to be responsible adults|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Well your reasone really doesnt explain anything. and im a teenager. im 17... really most wont because we seem to "not" care, or really we have alot on our mines. girls do. you think its just whos dating who but girls care bout others... adn same with most guys. put yourself in our shoes.moms n dad's dont always listen either... some dont believe or want to listen... so really if you dont listen to your teenager boy or girl, why do you think they'd listen to you?? I hope i did help.. its in a teenager's point of view, and sorry if i seemed rude....|`|T3b4I4kXaa	As the parent, you really have only so many years to teach your kids all they need to know to be able to get along in the world... respect, discipline, ethics, dependability, honesty. You have to teach these things any way you have to... even if it is by means of a belt across their rumps. <br>  As the parent, you work hard to put a roof over your kids' heads, clothes on their bodies, food on the table, and provide the opportunity of an education.<br>  As a parent, you have every right to expect that they clean up after themselves, do what few chores you ask them to do, make good grades, and stay out of trouble. If they don't like those simple rules, the door is that-a-way. Don't take any guff from a hormonal mess.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you are the parent. you are the boss. start acting like a parent... kids can not do what they are not allowed to do... if you let them get away with it they will only do more of what you don't want them to do...<br>  <br>  if they do anything that you do not want them to do...  be a parent and DEMAND that they do as they are told... if they don't, start by taking away all that is dear to them!!!!!!!  that will get their attention!!!!|`|a90d2414a4c76a94b6d06ed42bca2891aa	ListEn not liston.<br>  <br>  Use spell check.|`|EDYETUNCaa	They listen more then you think. It often depends on the situation, but teenager (any person really) want their own independence. Teenagers are in that in-between stage where they want to be the ones calling all the shots, yet they are to young to make some of the decisions that befall them. They want to learn from their mistakes instead of parents getting in their way. <br>  <br>  It's that control issue. It's hard for parents to let go of their children, but sometimes you need to, to allow them to grow. Unless your child is heavy into drinking and drugs or sex with countless partners, you probably don't need to worry as much if they don't listen or not. What they want is advice and often times they are still listening to what you're saying and will act accordingly.|`|zYf8YL06aa	Put yourself in their place.  sit them down and have a good conversation asking them how they would do certain things and that their opinion counts.  dont order them around.  involve them in household decisions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ei1TcLclaa	That's just it.

Since when did religion need to be the most important factor for an dating a perfect guy? I hear looks and personality are important, but I've never heard of religion before.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  No one should even change religion, two different religions can still coexist together. I think you seem to be the only one who actually is taking religion too seriously, just let it be and love him for who he is, not for what religion he is. And besides, Islam and Christianity follow the same god, just in different ways.<br>  <br>  If you're worrying about being married in a church rather then a mosque, you two can marry where my fiance and I are planning to marry, in a beautiful ceremonial garden.|`|gywXHuGCaa	it's the 21st century! i reckon religion shouldnt be in the way of loved ones! either he converts or you ''exit'' muslimism, is it possible to ''exit''?|`|9YOfDaSpaa	You should pray and ask God to guide you in your decision.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Ok, so I don't see a problem here, go for it.|`|gXG3bRwaaa	just have him throw a turban on his head wen hes around ur parents|`|OqGQ7WkBaa	let him convert if he says he will.<br>  guys like to do things for the ones they love.<br>  let him feel like a man and do something important for your relationship.<br>  <br>  i really hope that he does for the sake of your future together, but well inform him on the responsibilities of being a muslim.<br>  <br>  wishing you the best.<br>  <br>  -steph|`|PiF42aaOaa	hahahahhahahha seriously?<br>  muslim, not muslim we're all people DO WHATEVER YOU WANNTNTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

jRSzIzYqaa	You know what you need to change. If you feel controlling, step back a bit and hand him the reigns in the relationship. Don't put down girls he talks to either, and be careful about call him names. You're wanting a fairy tale relationship, but darling, everybody is looking for that Cinderella love story and very few people ever find it. Just find what you don't like and work to make small self improvements.|`|denyKCABaa	the right mind *set*.<br>  <br>  Hang out in person more. Go out to eat, go shopping. Don't talk on the phone sooo much it gets too routine and no one likes routines. Go get coffee or smoothies together. Go to his house and watch TV. Hang out with him and his friends. Invite him to hang out with you and your friends.|`|ft8nZREnaa	give him attention|`|Octzpyyhaa	...read the book...Why Men Love Bitches....it's about wowmen you are strong to show men they aren't a puch-over, needy or clingy.  Its really the best thing.  I have it at home!|`|gXG3bRwaaa	ur not gf material|`|OWjbg4GYaa	I been reading "why men love bitches" and let me tell you, what you are doing is suffocating him, sweetie, he will be gone any minute if you don't stop doing that. I have a question for you. "who is chasing who", "he has you oh you have him". Men like to compete, they like to know that they have to work to get something or someone, so if he really likes you he will do anything to get your attention. So my advise for you it will be to not call him at all, if you do that he will wander what is going on, and he will see that you too have a life, there is no thing more attractive than an independent women. Once he sees that you are independent and you could live with out him, he will be like "what the hell, she is not calling me no more" and then he will be the one calling YOU.  Read the book, it will really help you.|`|gxFJMeY5aa	start being more aware of what youre saying. When you say something you know is controlling or out of line, say youre sorry and change it. Soon your'll be able to stop speaking everything you think. Tell him how you feel. Let him know your insecure and need him to help you out sometimes. Compromise. If you'll less controlling he'll try harder to do things that make you happy.|`|HHniTZTbaa	make him dinner or something special, write him a letter or show him that you care. just remind him that he's so special to you and you're sorry if you're not a better girlfriend. but you sound okay!|`|W84gB7FYaa	Someone I know writes dairy about all the crap the pisses her off during the day to keep it to herself as much as she can.

7e4jxj3Daa	You'd be a fool not to!!!!|`|u7o75zipaa	Sounds like she's keen for a threesome..<br>  But consider it thoroughly before you go through with it. It might sound like an 'awesome' fantasy.. but do you really want to see your gf intimate with another girl? What if she seems to prefer action with the other girl?<br>  I'm not trying to stop you having one - plenty of couples do - but please be prepared for the outcome.|`|zaLBWWjnaa	I guess if your willing to see your girl literally cheating on you or just getting MAD at YOU when she sees you going at it with another girl. I'd avoid the situation.|`|ph8IcueRaa	A threesome is always worth pursuing, dream or no dream.  Do it.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Either she wants one...or she is testing you to see if you would want one (and may be upset if you say you do)...just ask her about it|`|tLOUuf3Maa	ew. uh. no.<br>  <br>  ask her if she wants a threesome with you, her,  then a plastic doll.<br>  ahaha.
26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	Its a control thing. You never want to let go of the things that make you feel better, and knowing that somebody likes you always does. This does not mean that he has your best interest in mind, it just means this person is selfish. You need to start focusing on things that will help you move ahead and try to let go of the things that hold you back. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.|`|cn49BbRiaa	You say that he is a player and hoping that he would change, but you can change someone who dosent want a change. Ive been there before. Some guys just want to have their cake and eat it at the same time. They want a variety of women so they keep them as friends so they can call them for their own convenience. The truth hurts but its the fact of this life that we are living in. They are some cold hearted men out there who just go around playing women for fools. Be careful.|`|jRSzIzYqaa	Maybe you're his girl friend and he doesn't feel the need to change anything, or maybe he's hoping something will happen. It doesn't mean that he's messed up or that you are either. You need to let go and stop hoping he'll change, though you already know that.|`|tZReiFF2aa	Sorry but you are far too good for him. You need to find another guy that is into you for you. Just stop dealing with these "players" and be real to yourself. Stop demeaning yourself by talking to him. Move on with your life.|`|mx7FINY8aa	He Obviously Likes You !!! <br>  Theres Definatly something about you that his girlfriend doesnt have think about it whats she got that you havnt and what have you got to offer that maybe she doesnt...<br>  But before you get in the way of their relationship ask him if he has feelings or iif he likes you back then yo can start trying to break them up do it in a nice way though just ask him if he likes you more then his girlfriend and that you like him alot !<br>  You never know untill you ask you may aswell ask him you have nothing to lose... If the girl is your friend dont try and split them or if they are genuinly happy and he doesnt like you back but i doubt that :) x<br>  Good luck Hope You get Him :D:D:D:D:D:D xxxxxxx|`|u7o75zipaa	I dont think you even need to ask this question. You know the answer, but you're avoiding it.<br>  He's a player. Yes, he may eventually find a girl he likes and stick with her, but if it was you don't you think it would have happened by now?<br>  He keeps you around so he can have you when he wants to.<br>  It's time to ditch him. It'll be hard at first, but honestly, he's not worth it.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	You know what he is and what he is doing.  Get  on with your life and pursue happiness.  Stop asking what you already know.|`|a984cQjKaa	yup, having you on a string like a little puppy dog is a huge ego boost to him. you're right that it's a problem he has; he's obviously terribly insecure and needs to have as much female attention as possible to feel like he's worth anything.  he's never going to change, most likely.  do yourself a huge favor, and stop talking to him-at least til you're stronger, if you really want to be friends with him.  you deserve much better than a childish little man-boy.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	he's taking advantage of you, because you obviously like him enough not to take a hint that he's not that into you. he's not worth you throwing yourself at him, it will ultimately make you feel really lousy and desperate if you keep talking to him|`|VXiMtwIsaa	Im in the same situation and this guy was like my everything and then suddenly...he was this playa and i didnt even know...hang out with friends and talk to others guys-even though there not him...eat icecream-and just try 2 be happy that what i do.

AA12155646	invite him over for pizza and a movie, turn the lights down low, and see what happens|`|Z2bRNVugaa	Ask him.|`|D6qa0yC3aa	There is no way to know given what you said.|`|lISrOzyraa	well you might want to write him a note and put it in his locker with your number on it or just tell him to write you back, and if your response is yes, then I do believe he like you. Or do it the way I would and ask " hey do you like me cause lately you've been looking at me alot, and making me laugh etc" if you want to...or you can ask one of your friends to ask him if he like you.|`|kv5lGrSdaa	That wasn't really enough information for me to help you out. But I'm pretty sure you got a chance of him liking you if y'all always laugh and stuff. Good Luck!|`|agfgsEqjaa	i would ask him.|`|qEkPcK9gaa	this is cute (Girl known boy all her life and they fall in love ..lol) Well you wont know until you ask because he might just think you a cool friend but not a girl friend..if you want you could ask.."hey dustin what do you think about me and he should tell you" ^_^ try that and look at his reaction<br>  <br>  -Meeks aka Hands0me Hustla|`|ciquDqIcaa	He probably sees you as more of a friend and it would damage your friendship if you tried to go out with him. Just see him as a friend and find someone else to go out with! :D|`|Si1K1Srxaa	Based on what you said...you can't really tell. The only sure way to know is to just ask him.
AA12090960	in my common knowledge you would have to file for a divorce in the jurisdiction where your marriage was registered.<br>  <br>  My sis got divorced and they got married in our home city and she moved in with him to his city. for the divorce they had to do it in the court here in our home city so she had to come back here to do that.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to quite say next. should I compliment you and say kudos on thinking ahead or should scold you for thinking negatively and ask why are you getting married if your thinking about divorce. But its really one of those eras we are living in where one has to be realistic about life.<br>  <br>  Why not register your marriage somewhere preferable (i.e. check out the laws of different countries to suit your needs - not illegal as far as know) and have your ceremony in Ireland if that's where you want it. I am sure I have read about well known ppl or celebrities that have done that.<br>  <br>  good luck anyway and best wishes, hoping you two stay together forever happily.<br>  <br>  edit - oh and I think if you were to file for divorce outside the place where you registered your marriage then your solicitor/ attorney would probably file it for you and put it through to the court of the place where your marriage was registered but you would need to check how true my whole statement is, probably by phoning up the registry office or checking the government website.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Usually there's a residency requirement, but I'm not an attorney or a resident of the UK.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	As long as you meet the residency reuirements of where you want to marry or divorce, and does not have to be the same place|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	You would have to file for divorce wherever you get married - I married in scotland but when I filed for divorce 20 years later ex lived in england but had to get a lawyer in scotland for the divorce because the law is different in scotland than england or ireland etc my divorce to several years and cost ￡35,000 - thank goodness for legal aid. It is 2 years seperation in scotland but can be done after 1 year for adultery or attack.|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	You can get divorced anywhere i would think. If you live in the U.S. and are vacationing in say, Jamiaca, and you decide to get married there, what are you supposed to do? Fly back together to Jamaica to get divorced? I would think not.
NDFN04sqaa	HA!  Parent psycology!  Okay everyone calm down!  First we gals always get in fights with our mom's - you know why because we love them and they love us - we fight with them because when we need to vent we trust them with our anger and frustration (we can't do that with our girlfriends)  <br>  <br>  As for punishing yourself you mom just wants to to think about the situation and come up with a punishment that is suitable to the situation ( i.e. on a cell phone after hours - take the cell phone away for a week.. ect.).  Give her wants she wants and you both can move on from it.  Besides if you let her do it it could be worse than what you think.|`|AA11180444	What did you do?<br>  <br>  What she is doing, is making you responsible for your own actions.  A good move on her part.  She is testing you to see how responsible you really are.  In turn, she will know how much to trust you as far as responsibility goes.|`|ZvOXs61caa	lmao. haha. i wish i had your mom. ground yourself for a day and say hey this is my punishment. or give a punishment that u know would be not as bad as hers. seems like your getting the better side of the deal. :]|`|v2Pab3pgaa	Say ... "I have been punishing myself for my entire life by having a mother like you" <br>  <br>  That will shut her up.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	tell her u dont know what she means and u just want ur punishment to be from her. tell her u feel awkward about that. haha|`|XPYR2gq1aa	Lol, sweet!  No seriously tho you can swing this your way big time!  First of all, what were you fighting over?  What does she do wrong that she is then punishing you for? <br>  <br>  Anyways, if I were you I would be really strict on myself and like stay home on a friday night and clean the house and cook for her.  Then she will be all stooked and you will be off the hook with one night in.  <br>  <br>  Or maybe you could make yourself write an essay about what you learned (my mom used to make me do this ****!) and it shows you have remorse and have learned!!!  Thats always brownie points since you are less likely to make this same mistake again!!!|`|KcloaW4vaa	What that first girl said. My mom is way worse than what u have to put up with (shes not from the U.S.). But what i would say is what that other girl said. I have been punishing myself the whole time by dealing with you everyday! Thats bad enough, dont u think?! Then she will get the point.
x0J8S5sWaa	You don't give that many specifics, but if you want to start over again there are many things you can do.<br>  <br>  Are you saying that you don't want to stay in the relationship that you are now in? I wasn't quite sure what you meant, but if you are saying that then I suppose the best thing is just to be honest. Once you are in a situation where you can find yourself another worth while relationship, start slow. Go hang out with some friends, meet some nice people, and see if there's anyone interesting. Be yourself and treat others well and they will all love you. If I misunderstood and you do want to stay in your relationship, be honest about that too. Sit your companion down and tell them how frustrated and stuck you feel. Maybe they've been feeling the same way, and you just need to talk it through? Or maybe you'll come to the conclusion that it isn't going to work? Who knows, but atleast you'll clear the air and know what's going on.<br>  <br>  As for finances, do something you truly enjoy and try not to worry too much about how much you get for it. Make sure you get enough to pay the bills of course but remember, there's more to life than money. Keep in touch with your children and be a part of their lives. Eat good foods, always be on the lookout for new interesting things and avoid falling into routines that you are uncomfortable with.<br>  <br>  Your question was quite general so I just threw out a couple suggestions. Hopefully you got something out of it, and if not I'm glad to give some other tips. Goodluck, and just remember that you are worth it and shouldn't make yourself stay in situations in which you are unhappy! It may be hard breaking the mold now, but you'll thank yourself later.<br>  <br>  P.S. You are very beautiful. Saw your pictures :)|`|9QeV07zJaa	start by making your financial health  non dependent on your relationships.

When my father passed away, she worked even harder than before to make up for the massive cut of money coming into our household.  When I got old enough, I worked as well to help with the bills.<br>  <br>  Now, she is successful and married to a man who genuinely loves her.<br>  <br>  She never ran away-and for that, she endured what others would call the unendurable-and came out stronger than she ever was before.<br>  <br>  Stop using your past as a crutch and learn from it!<br>  <br>  "That which does not kill you makes you stronger." -Friedrich Nietzsche.|`|bVojEBDVaa	The truth is you're half way through your life, and life is short. The last thing you want is regrets, so go on a vacation, maybe to a beach, for a few days. Evaluate your life, and see what you love, and do it. As long as your children are taken care of, nothing should hold you back. Guilt imprisons you, so don't let that be a factor.|`|HHniTZTbaa	Talk to your partner about it. Talk to your children. See if you can work things out. But otherwise stay close to see them and give them support, but go out more with your friends and talk to them. Good luck(:|`|wqZbkYpMaa	speed dating|`|mgdkr6hvaa	If you really want to start over, then don't stick with the things that make you unhappy.  Drop the partner if it's not working.  <br>  What do you mean lost your salary?, did you lose your job? or just get a pay cut? sry but a little confused by that.  <br>  Start looking for a new job if it's not working, but in these hard times it's a little hard to find a new good job. But it'd problably be better to work in a job in a nice atmosphere.  <br>  If your children are grown up then it's much easier to kinda start over, i mean keep them in your lives and all but you dont really have to worry about them as much, as long as they've moved out by now, and if they haven't then maybe they should.  <br>  You could also start looking for a new place to live if you really wanna start over.<br>  New job, new house, new attitude.<br>  to start over, the main thing you need is just a new attitude. Happy and positive, not exactly carefree but don't let things stress you out too much. Your only as stressed out as you make yourself.<br>  Good luck, i hope this helps.
DGCIrUBcaa	I think you should write your mom a letter. In it explain exactly what happened. Tell her about the peer pressure and the bulling and how hard that can be. Explain that you understand that what you did was wrong and that it will never happen again. Tell her how scared you are and how the worst part of all this is disappointing her.<br>  <br>  Then write a letter of apology to the store. Tell them why you did it and assure them it would never happen again if they are kind enough to give you another chance. Give both letters to your mom and then take a deep breath because the worst is now over.<br>  <br>  The worst part of your ordeal is your mom finding out. Once she knows, the worst is over. You may be grounded or get a tongue lashing but i'm sure you can handle that. <br>  If you were my child (I have 4). I would prefer to hear about it in this way from you and you would get brownie points from me for your honesty. I would also be sympathetic about the details that made you do it in the first place. I'd give you a big hug, tell you it's all going to be ok, then ground you for a month. But hey, then I'd get to hang out with you for a while lol.<br>  Good luck hun, everything will be fine.|`|AAexkTAKaa	tell her the truth! she may be angry at first, but trust me - she will understand. she could proberbly ring the school to get all the ppl who persuaded u into trouble. this is blackmail, it has to stop! make sure when u tell her, u sound like u care alot, otherwise she will be more cross. remember, honesty is best policy. be brave and remember, we r in this together (even tho i dont know who u r lol!)<br>  good luck x|`|IkgyyPtYaa	I think you should explain to your mum what happened, and how it made you feel.<br>  Ask her to not interrupt you while you speak, and she might not understand at first, but it will get better, and she should understand<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ZZkInusMaa	just tell her about the bullies im sure she will understand but the longer you leave it the worse it will get ...<br>  good look please tell her|`|mx7FINY8aa	I really wish i could help you and i really do feel for you i know how bad it feels to be presured into stealing something even when you know its wrong but you know what your mum will say better than us ...

Perhaps you could go with your mother and explain the situation, and ask him for advice with dealing with those bullies.<br>  <br>  Face up to it, love, and you'll find it's a whole lot easier, and it will also make it easier to deal with those nasty bullies that put you up to it in the first place.|`|ATyHswTTaa	ur going have to tell ur mum, as she could find out from somebody else and be in more trouble.. sit her down and tell her u got bullied and if didnt do it u would get a beating so u went ahead and done what u did as u were scared not to. then apologies and ask ur mum for forgivness.. the most that will happen is be punished and grounded for few weeks but at least u were honest with ur mum. that is the main thing, dont break ur mum trust in ur honesty been lost between the both of ye! <br>  <br>  i think u also need new friends as no true friend would presure or bully u into shop lifting, u need find friends that are more focused on their studies and activities after school instead of the ones u have.. they are not ur friends what so ever as if they were they would never made u do such a thing..|`|9lmTVu20aa	If you are honest with her and just tell her, she might be angry.<br>  But imagine how angry she would be if she finds out from someone else, and also that you hid it from her? <br>  Just tell her, it's hard but it is the right thing to do.|`|jCB7S6sfaa	You need to tel your mom.

Catfights can be vicious.|`|QrJFxBWFaa	OK you could play this out 3 ways option one is you could w8 for him to ask you out and risk the chance of loosing him or option 2 you could ask him if you or him would like ever have a chance or something along those lines in a playful manner or option 3 u could flirt back and w8 till your alone to ask him if he likes you but to be honest with u go with what u feel is right if your not getting good vibes if u to close to him or the body language inst there forget about him and move on rather stay friends then ruin your friendship|`|HHniTZTbaa	He sounds sorta smitten, i'd give it a bit longer to be friends first though. If you like him in a month or two then why not? Lifes too short(: Good luck
naequcqlaa	I so much wish I had an answer for you.  I lost my beautiful 14 yr. old granddaughter less that 2 1/2 yrs. ago.  I sat on the couch just yesterday remembering her & the tears just rolled down my face.  Her parents & sister who was driving the car are STILL devastated by it & I KNOW we w/NEVER be the same again.  We all do our best to remember the good times we had w/her.  They are still finding little things she'd done in pictures she took of herself w/her cell phone camera, still finding little notes & letter she wrote then knew nothing about.  I too well know your pain, honey.  Do your best to remember the good things, good times you had w/him.  That's what we do our best to do is think of the positive as apposed to the negative.  ONE thing, she was a Christian, this is the ONE thing we hold on to in KNOWING FOR SURE we WILL see her again some day.  We DO KNOW where she is, she does leave "signs" for us that we know she's w/us.  At her sister's graduation we had a blue parakeet fly over ONLY our section of a whole football field filled w/people.  It then went up & flew ONLY over the girls section of the whole class of a very large graduating class.  It then flew back to us, & landed on the ground rite in front of us.  Her favorite color was blue!  Where would a tame household parakeet come from?!  Why fly just over us & over her sister?!  We totally took this as a "sign" she was rite there w/us the whole time!  No, we are NOT crazy!  She loved her cats, was going to be a veteranarian.  There are nites their cats walk around "strangly" & very restless.  We know Dawn is around & it's comforting to her family to know & feel this.  We hold on to the "promise" we KNOW we WILL see her again in a far better place.  Take comfort in knowing he is OK, it's we the ones who are left behind that do the hurting.  Just try your very best in keeping all the good memories alive in your mind.  This you know is what he'd want you to do.  So do it for him.  Take care, honey, & just know you're not alone...:)|`|EJ8iS9R4aa	sorry to hear that, honestly i don't think anyone can ever cope over losing someone. Think about the good times you spent with him. My grandmother died when I was 8 from lung cancer, it kills me to think about her and how much i miss her, i still cry and I'm 20 now so its been awhile. every-time i go to her grave i don't stay long cuz i know im going to cry and once i start its hard to stop, :( but i don't think there's a right answer to your question everyone is different. just remember all the good times and laughs.  Stay strong. hope this helps<br>  : )|`|AA10478980	You may need to think about what he would want for you.  He would want you to get on with life, and to enjoy life to the fullest for his sake.  He would not want you to mourn for him, but to do good things and to live life in his memory.  You cannot bring him back.  What you can do is honor his memory.|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	There is not a single answer that anyone is going to tell you that will help you "cope" with death.  It is a sad thing, and im sorry to hear about your loss.  But I do believe that the best healer is time, but don't expect it too quickly.|`|tmyiEtWhaa	just think<br>  <br>  you can cry because he passed away. or you can smile because he has lived.|`|tDeYQV6raa	try to be a better person in his honor.|`|JQZzI49Paa	It will take time, expecially since it sounds like you were very close. Lots of time|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Get grief counseling.|`|rK3BY6aZaa	I personally don't agree to counseling and what I do is (I grieve for a friend also who passed at a very young age) When the time comes around I light a candle and take a picture that I have and tell him how much I miss him.I also plant a tree and that is his and when I look at it and see life it makes me feel better. I also feel that there are spirits around us of those we have lost and I speak with them. And whenever I see something that my friend liked in this life I smile and think of him.Call me nuts but it works for me.|`|cMyPQ90vaa	i know how you feel because i lost my grandfather in 93 and than i lost my grandmother in 95 and i was really, really close to both of them and now here we are in 09 and i still think of them everyday and i still sit here and cry like a baby and the way you feel will always be there but just try to keep your mind on other things and you'll be ok i'm not saying to forget about it because that would never happen but if you keep your mind on other things you'll be ok that's what i do. good luck and keep your head up :)|`|SdmwrVpbaa	He must have been wonderful to you. HE made you feel special. Think about the things that made him happy. Maybe his family, or an organization, of a special friend, then do something nice for the person or organization in his name. Then go an buy some fresh flowers for yourself, and smile.  No more tears, he wouldn't want that. : )|`|VELnLnIKaa	my girlfriend was brutally murdered feb 25 2006 i freak out this whole week every year the pain never goes away but it does soften over the years|`|0rpN2419aa	It is normal to think of your uncle and feel sad that he died in an accident, but if your are still grieving deeply day after day, you might want to talk to someone about it.  If the grief hits you about the time of year that the accident happened that is okay as long as it isn't consuming your life.  Yes, you will miss him, but I hope soon you can live with the wonderful memories you have on him and not the grief.|`|XTDeAfTqaa	You should get some grief counseling. Four years is way too long for you to be this emotional.<br>  I was lucky. None of my relatives died until I was 35. My Grandfather and I were very close and I was by his side when he left this world. He was 85. I miss him but my life still goes on without him. I mourned for about a week.<br>  My Grandmother died this past November at age 94. Surprisingly I barely shed a tear. She had gone to be with her Husband and her Brothers and Sisters.<br>  I think one thing that helped me was that I got to Eulogize both of them at their funerals. That gave me a lot of closure.<br>  I don't know if I'm cold hearted or logical. Although I can never physically see them again I know I have the best Guardian Angels anyone could ask for.<br>  Next time you visit your Uncle's grave tell him everything that made him special to you. Write it down before you go and leave the letter behind.<br>  See if that doesn't help.|`|toLCaFc9aa	That is normal, but you have to remember that death is part of life. We are all going to die soon or later. His time came and all you can do now is remember him and keep him close to your heart.|`|XaSIyG0Paa	Keep your mind busy go out and do things, or if it helps think about the good things that he has done in your life.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	That means he is alive in your heart.
d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	If polygamy is legalised then polyandry also must be legalized.<br>  If the man can marry as many girls as he can afford<br>  the girl should also be allowed to marry as many men she can handle<br>  and slowly the world is going this way....<br>  Even this law will favour the rich, and not the poor<br>  just tell me how many girls can u really afford ?|`|hMavMBo4aa	Well if you're talking evolution.  It is natural for men to want to spread their seed.  Men want to reproduce, and because they cannot be 100% sure of paternity (since women give birth and know it's theirs, duh :), they must spread their seed to as many women as possible to pass on their wonderful genes.  Women, on the other hand, instinctually, want to have a baby with a man who will stay and take care of him and nurture him and provide for her and baby.  So that doesn't make sense......it seems evolutionarily for this to work out, a man would have many wives.  I guess that seems no fun for the wives, though.  Have you been watching Big Love?  If you haven't, you should!|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If it wasn't, it would be a mental health disaster. It's enough work to maintain a marriage to one person, let alone more. Most of the people who practice this are evil old tradition monkeys who want to slam 13 year olds. Graphic, but true. Have you seen women who are involved in this? Look at their eyes. Always empty. Hollow. Relying on rules instead of substantive fulfillment, and a non-existent text that one doof claims he saw.<br>  <br>  You will know them by their fruits....|`|jAGwyyuyaa	I think it depends on how you were raised. If someone grew up in that environment, then of course they would think that, that is the way everyone is. But most women don't want to share their man with a # of other women. And most men have a hard time dealing with one women and a couple of kids, let alone a football team. And what happens when the man can't perform anymore? Do the women go get some from one of the other men folk in the tribe?|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You vow to fore sake all others. I don't hate it for you but it is not for me. If I wanted to have multiple partners I would not have married. Why is it only that men can have more than one wife but a wife can't have more than one husband?|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	The say it becomes OK for a woman to have more than one husband, I'll agree that it's OK for a man to have more than one wife.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	It always ends up with one man and multiple women. As a woman, I really don't want to share my husband. I wouldn't marry someone who didn't pledge to be sexually faithful. Polygamy is just infidelity.<br>  <br>  It is abusive to women. Since the husband has a choice of whom to spend his time, affection and money on, the women must compete to be the nicest. He can be as grumpy as he wishes.<br>  <br>  Marriage is about stability and taking care of each other. Polygamous marriages are unstable in a free democratic country where women have rights and education. It might work in backwards company, but it doesn't work here.<br>  <br>  In a polygamous family, the wives aren't married to each other. If the man dies, they are all on their own. They don't provide any benefit to each other in any legal or moral sense. The government is left to pick up the tab for all the kids.<br>  <br>  And lastly, it's unfair to the men who can't find wives. Do the math. It creates a lot of excess men, and they can cause a lot of social ills.|`|fzVJrBUiaa	Sweetie that right there is just plain out crazy! Why would you want more than one wife? Just for sexual pleasure? Do you know what a sin is? Having more than one woman WHILE married is a BIG sin its call ADULTERY Mister.<br>  <br>  So if u want to be judged by the Lord on his day for something you can prevent then its YOUR CHOICE.....I think its wrong for Polygamy this is just MY opinion..<br>  <br>  Take care all the Best:)|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It's still gross and what good looking self respecting woman wants a multi dipped wick anyway?  It's hated on because it isn't natural.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	it's not just the polygamy it's the way they raise their children and live their lives... 'promised' off to marriage at 13 & 14 and having kids so young.
kQgSi1MEaa	stop being such a f*cking tomboy. or date a girl<br>  <br>  guys want to date GIRLS, not another guy.|`|pnZssBg9aa	Hi Pahonu, You're not alone...I'm alone as well.<br>  I think tomboyishness is a real turn off for guys. Perhaps all you need is a makeover. I've a friend who is like you once, who said she was lonely and tomboyish. I told her to hang out more with other girls and do girls' stuff like shopping, fashion etc and she now has a boyfriend.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	where a dress and get you're hair done|`|8EgftXwXaa	i can honestly say that tomboys are the hottest type of girl. <br>     There is an point where its too much. if the girl burbs and farts a ton, its not attractive. Its awesome to be good at sports, and to be smart. But you dont want to act like a total guy. still do ur hair, and if you think u need to, put some makeup on, but not a lot. be urself, but dont curse too much, you want to sound intelligent. Confidence is sexy. its way more attractive than being shy. <br>     Basically, athletic, smart, funny girls are attractive, but it still needs to be apparent that you are, in fact, a girl. lol get it??|`|YbnEr1z7aa	Friends with benefits.... just please them
5a86d89ea69e82fdaada1b1a8446ca9aaa	You said it yourself, your friends shouldn't care if they are decent people, and if they judge then they aren't friends with you because they like who you are, and you should ditch them imo. If you take pride in yourself and the place you live in, it will show, but if you don't, that will also show. So change that negative attitude, and stop denying it's your home since it's the only one you've got. Where you come from is forever going to be a part of you and you can't just abandon that. If you want people to feel welcome in you home, then make it look respectful and fix up the place like it was part of your own outward appearance like say the clothes you chose to wear each day. Let your personality be expressed through your home, and make the best of what u got.|`|DPmU5gB6aa	please don't let it hold you back from anything. You shouldn't be ashamed of this "situation". You should be proud of your family. I really wouldn't mind about anything of the things you mentioned above. People who really care about you wouldn't mind either. if they do, they're not worth your friendship or being you partner. This definitely is not sth that you should be ashamed of. No way.<br>  <br>  Best wishes:)|`|AA11441704	If they are your friends.......they shouldn't be bothered about your house........so..........don't worry|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Do not be ashamed. It is beyond your control. Friends do love you for who you are. They don't care where you live. Tell your friend before you bring them over what to expect.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	if they are your friends they will not judge you no matter what circumstances you come from|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	i grew up in a family of 5 other siblings and our parents rarly ever cleaned the house that was ours to do. but our house was never clean dishes were always in the sink. it was not discusting but imberrassing non the less. you can't help the fact you are living in those circumstances unless you can somehow move out. as for not having friends over i have not been to your house . but maybe you could just go to their homes. im really sorry. can you talk to your family and try and set up some house rules? goodluck and sorry i was not much help|`|c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	You already know the true meaning of friendship. You stated yourself "if they were really your friends they wouldn't care" You are correct about your thoughts. There are people who will judge according to someone financial status. These are the same people who do not have true friends. The only friends they are those who are interested in their money. <br>  <br>  There are no one holding you down but you. You will never know your true friends until you feel comfortable about your financial situation.  What I mean is you are misjudging your friends. You should be eager to know who are your real friends because real friends will always be there for you. They won't give damn about your money or the appearance of your home. If any of them do, then you know they are not your friend.<br>  <br>  I plead with you to continue to be a good person and give your friends a chance. You said you're not trashy looking or acting in anyway, and I believe you. So your friends will be attracted to your goodness. Don't be ashamed because it's your personality that's  important. God bless.|`|n90KqgAEaa	you shouldn't be ashamed of your circumstances, it's not like it's your fault. If you really want to get closer to your friends and start a relationship, go ahead. If they really like or love you, they won't leave you because of how you live.

The only women I've ever met since high school ended in '98 are from the Internet. Dating sites work. Forget eHarmony for the moment. Try plentyoffish.com or myspace.com. Yes you read that right, Myspace is a great place to meet women and the best thing about those websites is the fact that its free. You can post pictures of yourself, tell people what you are all about and you don't have to leave the house. Although you will eventually if ya want to go out on that first date.

7sA8HwTzaa	Don't worry too much about the surroundings.  Concentrate your decorating efforts to where you and your groom will be standing as you take your vows.  That's the only place people will actually be looking, anyway.  Candelabra stands and floral arrangements on pedestals are beautiful.  Attach large tulle bows to the sides of the chairs on the aisles if you think you need them and maybe add  a couple of flowers to the bows on the front row bows.<br>  <br>  Your reception decorations will be viewed for a much longer time than the ceremony's.  Put your money and energy into those, instead.

Then after you have a nice conversation and stuff, you can tell him you really like him and put your hand on the part of his clothing covering his penis. Guys don't mind when girls touch them so don't be afraid to do so. Most guys really like being touched by girls. Then ask him to be your boyfriend.

Always show her you love her and it doesn't have to be with gifts, just tell her and hold her hand and hold her close. Be her best friend and listen to what she has to say even if you don't know what to to tell her about her problem. understand she will have bad days and will need to vent, its not your fault but she will vent to you because you understand her. be honest with her and tell her when something bothers you or makes you mad, she would rather hear it from you then some one else and she will do anything to help you. communication is key. I am sure she will be happy with you.|`|LZDAFdpaaa	First, you should probably learn to spell "together" and "feel". Second, little surprises like flowers sent to her work, a card under her windshield wiper, a surprise date to somewhere new, or saying something sweet unexpectedly always make a girl happy. Third, learn to let the little things go. There's a reason they're called the little things. Plus, if you can't let these things go, then you'll be miserable.|`|pRfSBmAQaa	tell her she's beautiful<br>  if you can, call her in the middle of the day and leave a message telling her how much you love her<br>  if she looks upset ask her if she's alright (trust me, this is really important to us girls)|`|N4ijiX2Caa	open doors.<br>  buy her things- like when she comes to see you, have a chocolate for her or a flower. <br>  massages are always great! foot, back, neck, hands.<br>  make her dinner. <br>  always offer for your help, like if she needs anything- a ride somewhere, help with homework, advice with friends.<br>  ask her if there's anything she wishes you could be doing better- be totally open. tell her whats on your mind and be honest. random sweet things are always great too, like surprise notes or text messages, or a spontaneous outing.<br>  i have the best boyfriend, and whatever he's doing is keeping me wanting more... just keep it up, buddy.<br>  good luck<br>  =)|`|JSGsWhHBaa	Try giving it to her in the "Princess Position" ahh... never mind.<br>  <br>  Women/Girls really all just want to know you love them, buy her stuff say you love her, and go out together. <br>  <br>  Tell her you'll do whatever she desires (bondage?) and do stuff that you and her will greatly enjoy.|`|7QDYWAkfaa	aww i don't really know what to say since I'm only 19.<br>  But aww (:|`|WTjgVrrsaa	pick her after school,and drive her wherever she want to go|`|z2xurYsLaa	The main thing I have to say is l-i-s-t-e-n. In some way she will tell you everything she wants. I'm getting married in June and what I love most is when a beautiful girl walks by and he turns to stare at me. Just make her feel special whether you're at home just the two of you or out on the beach with a huge crowd. Just always make an effort to have conversation with her that way you will always know how she's feeling and it makes it easier for you to keep her happy.|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	just be yourself because that is who she fell in love with always make her feel special  and there no other women  that could come close to her let her know how great she looks  let her know that you will always be there for her give her a rose for no special reason let her no that your always thinking of her leave little love notes laying around for her but don't  smother her but just remember that their is no perfect relationship and sometimes its nice to have a disagreement because its the making up that can be fun , true love never always runs smooth|`|q3UiNyDdaa	First learn how to spell/type. Then when you leave her littl notes, she won't be destractid by your bad speeling (yeah, that was all on purpose). So in case you didn't pick up on it, leave her a little note NOW AND THEN. Don't go overboard, that will just make you look creepy. Complement her and show her some love, but don't just melt into putty and bombard her constantly with complements, it will be a turn off. And make sure that she knows how she helps make your life better.|`|AA11069237	how cute. just wanting to know what to do is a good sign. you should actually listen to her...do active listening and dont just say "uhuh" <br>  also make it all about her every once in a while. you know what mean...stay away from the wam-bam-thankyou-mam. lol|`|uNUUX7tpaa	I think ......keep the relationship fun. Don't make her feel bored. Keep looking in the eyes and smile. Make her feel that you are only hers and not anybody else's. Just don't give her any chance to fight with you and let her be at peace.|`|SfHnBaBYaa	Just be yourself and appreciate her for who she is. Don't try to change her or yourself. She obviously likes you the way you are. <br>  Good luck!|`|SVk5t3Klaa	give her long movie kisses and tell her that she's special in a very calm tone... do the things you both like to do together... nice question|`|7yM2doGlaa	You are already the sweetest guy ever.<br>  Okay, this is the thing my boyfriend does that keeps him from making me feel perfect :P<br>  APOLOGIZE<br>  Literally, when you do something wrong just say you're sorry and mean it. Don't make excuses for yourself. Don't apologize because she 'feels' that way. Be a man and apologize when you make a mistake.<br>  <br>  Also,<br>  Never pressure her into anything. Let everything just happen naturally. Always praise her when other people are around, ie this is my gorgeous girlfriend when introducing her to friends.<br>  <br>  Don't smother her. Let her be her own person with her own hopes and dreams. Respect her decisions and don' expect her to change for you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hopefully she deserves you :P|`|kKPT2VCfaa	You sound like you are on the right track :] you seem really sweet. I would say that the emotional things count more than anything you buy her, so listen to her when she speaks, look at her when you kiss her [I think ;) ] and surprise her sometimes with little things [whether material or not] =D|`|IK6FZ5TPaa	Buy her teddy bears, take her out to romantic dinners, go to the beach, take  her places, buy her chocolate, rub her feet, rub her back, play with her, go on hikes, do what she likes, get her a puppy if she likes them, go camping together, get tickets to where she wants to go, go shopping with her, all sorts of things like that!  And tell her how you feel, cuddle with her while watching titanic, or another cute romantic movie like that  Tell her that there is no other women you would ever want to be with!  Make her feel special, like she is the only person in the world!  Tell her you appreciate her a lot for being in your life..cook for her, clean for her..do anything and everything that she likes!  Go for picnics at the park. Hope I helped, I am only 13! lol..but i just described if i had a boyfriend what i would want him to do to make me feel like a queen!  Hope it works out! =] ohhh and buy her expensive jewelery if she likes it!|`|37M3dkkRaa	just let her know everyday how important she is to you, you don't have to say it but you can show it. just hold her close and let her know that you'll never let anything hurt her or come between you two. massages are nice. you can take her out for something romantic and secluded, like a lake or beach, even a park at night just to sit outside and watch the stars or the sunset, if its dark be sure to bring candles. always let her know that you love her more than anything else in the world and that she makes you happier than anyone else ever has or ever can.|`|aeiP74PLaa	flowers and chocolates and text her i love u 3 times a day(breakfast lunch and before bed)|`|T12qECtnaa	Listen to her and look in her eyes and smile. when just sitting around, rub the small of her back, that always makes me feel like he really cares!!
TCehI17kaa	Thanks for the nice tribute. It means alot.  I didn't say i was leaving for sure but I'm very upset right now b/c i lost my job today & i don't know what's going to happen to me in the future. I don't know if i'll be able to keep the place i live if I'm out of work for long. I do need some time to think. I was so happy today b/c i was going to surprise my father for his Birthday & now this happened. :-(|`|6tGYe5roaa	Woah! I just got on here. Is Scooter really leaving? He is one of my favorite contacts. I can't imaging answers without him.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	Scooter has been there for many of us! I agree it could never be the same if he decided to leave!

dCmSA6r2aa	just ignore him|`|xb1x51Koaa	Make a list of all of the things in your life that you are grateful for and make you happy now. Even if its tiny stuff. Put it in your purse and read it all throughout the day, especially when you start to think about him or start to get down. I've done it before. It worked... In fact, I wrote a new list ever morning until I felt better.|`|AA10630266	I know what she means.When someone is down in the family,it just ruins the whole mood and the whole atmosphere gets cold.While you are with them,just be thankful of what you have and be happy for that.Leave your problems behind.I don't know anybody who doesn't have any problems.It is not the end of the world.men come and go.not worth waisting your time and energy over him.If it didn't work,that means it wasn't meant to be,just wasn't for you. Corrage doesn't  always come roaring.Sometimes it is a little voice on the end of the day that says....I will try again tomorrow.Go on your trip and enjoy the little things.Turn your head to the sun and you won't see the shadows.|`|vh9i9IsIaa	How is your imagination power?<br>  I usually try to remember my best and funniest<br>  memories at these times.<br>  Also, if you can dance, it'll be of great help.<br>  The other way is getting involved in doing things<br>  like making dinner, desserts, joining games sainging...<br>  Good Luck|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	You need to actually enjoy your family. Laugh at their antics (or their hair). Remember what it was like before, when you use to play with them and have good times. Look at old family photos, and remember that there was a time when life was fun, before you met the boyfriend. Take back your life, and never let some idiot man take it away from you again. Remember that you only get a hundred or so years on this planet, and you'd better enjoy them while you've got them. Read some jokes on the internet. I'll get you started:<br>  A man brings his monkey into the bar and orders a drink. The monkey starts running all over the bar, sticking everything he sees in his mouth. At first it was funny, but when the monkey ate the cue ball off the billiard table, the bartender had had enough. "Get that monkey out of here," he said. A couple of weeks later, the man brought the monkey back to the bar and ordered a drink. The monkey ran all over the bar, and like last time, put everything he saw into his mouth. However, this time before he ate things, he would put them up his butt. The patrons of the bar were disgusted, and asked why the monkey was behaving that way. The man said, "I'm sorry-- he still eats everything he sees, but ever since the cue ball incident, he likes to measure them first!"|`|YUkwTD2gaa	im sorry about the guy - i hope things will go well for you both :)<br>  <br>  but, to answer your question, it depends on how well you can cover up your emotions - are you a person that wears their heart on your sleeve? if so, then maybe it might be a little hard for you. but here are a few tips anyways:<br>  - dont smile ALL the time; someone is bound to suspect something, just smile and laugh when you need to (DONT over do it)<br>  - act like yourself, don't shy away from your family - just concentrate on making everyone feel comfortable<br>  - always try and think positive, think of all the good times and memories (never fails for me :)<br>  <br>  but, this might not be a good idea after all (but it depends on how long its going to be - if its for quite a while, then maybe, just maybe - you might have a little outburst of emotion - might not be dramatic enough to be called a breakdown, but then again it depends on how well you can control your emotions)<br>  if it does happen, confide in your mother - for your mother to be saying that to you is kind of selfish - it's kinda ironic that she's asking you to be selfess inorder for herself and the rest of your family. it's a bit of weight on the shoulders, but im sure you'll pull through :)<br>  <br>  btww, i just play songs in my head while dealing with a situation - makes me change into the right mood<br>  <br>  think of your favorite song - or a song that holds a great significence to you - while you're doing it. just make sure it isnt a sad song! :p<br>  here's my fav at the moment: Crystal Ball by Keane|`|8zd6OqJ5aa	For a whole year?? aww I'm sorry D:<br>  <br>  but seriosly being unhappy like that is unhealthy =0<br>  <br>  Don't fake being happy. BE happy. vacation? come on I have never even been outta the state so you gotta try to enjoy yourself! Do things that are fun to YOU so that you can enjoy the trip as much as you can.  <br>  <br>  I know you seem to be stuck and hurting but you gotta let it go or else you're going to hurt yourself even more =[<br>  <br>  I know you're like gee thanks but that didn't help me... but I just think you should forget him, whoever that idiot is and move on and be happy... ok try?<br>  <br>  hope I helped =/|`|6e3707a0a921581080b666d1f0f81f12aa	I'm sorry that I don't have the sweet words of wisdom to offer you but I think that you will appreciate what I'm going to tell you. IT'S ABOUT ALL YOU, GIRL. You are the only person holding your back for complete happiness. Everyone one has their demons, you need to humble and find YOURSELF in order to fight them. Your mother was totally wrong. BE YOU! If you feel like crying, cry. Let it out. Then get over youself! Enjoy your life.|`|ZZThs5mXaa	The way I vent to deal with these types of situations is through music or writing. Bring along some music to "tune out" for awhile. Or find something you really enjoy. Make some "Me time" doing something you enjoy while your there. And just keep the fact that soon it will be over in you mind and you'll get through it. Good luck hun.|`|F8J5TVQGaa	find an event in your life or a show you like, funny track you listen to and take it with. every time you get down, think of the funny part.<br>  <br>  but srsly, you need to solve the problem to really take control of your life|`|FMKJ5Ejvaa	Yeah, I can see your situation will be difficult.. just make frequent trips away from the family group to 'make a call'  Maybe that will help with the stress.|`|HdmRtF71aa	smile and nod,  picture everyone takin a crap

2tn8EALqaa	yes. forget fake answers|`|7B0qFbWBaa	depends. how big//?|`|7ypRtqAGaa	To someone who is looking for someone based on their looks, then yes, a "big nose" may be a turn off to them. but the thing is, everyone is different and what may be a turn off to them may not be a turn off to someone else, and vise versa ! so don't worry about your appearance, except & love who you are and what you look like. because there will be a girl out there for you, that loves it too =) take care !|`|37M3dkkRaa	it all depends on how big it is and what shape it is, and if it fits the rest of his face. its kind of hard to find someone with such a big nose you're just automatically like OMG WTF?! HE'S A FREAK OF NATURE. so actually i don't think its that BIG of a turnoff|`|mOxVL0luaa	nope coz in every ppl eye there is different view. there is sentences bout this i think it goes like this "different ppl different costume"|`|71VRvldJaa	No, not at all!.....as long as you can smell and breath through it, it's perfect!|`|3BW6my5jaa	yaa|`|1hcupwT4aa	It depends... sometimes it can be kind of cute in my opinion (:<br>  <br>  Most people would consider it a flaw, I consider flaws unique characteristics.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	it depends on the shape of their face and how it suits them..for some ethnic groups this looks elegant and if they had smaller noses it would be a turnoff...<br>  <br>  some gorgeous greek men has big noses..so it all depends on how it looks|`|3MmVWDT3aa	Depends on the girl/boy.

Yeah, it probably is, depending on how big your nose is. If you are just trying to pick up chicks it will affect you more than if you are trying to be with someone you know. Unless you are like Pinocchio, in which case you are screwed.|`|kU0pC50Uaa	yes|`|p7mTFGJyaa	I have a big nose. It's ok with me. It depends: does it have a bump, balls(mole),or looks like a parrot nose?....It may be a turnoff for thoes who are just for the facial features, other than that, if you have a great personality(and don't focus your attention to your nose), everything else don't matter.|`|i9MKTn26aa	If it is, I'm screwed.|`|wybTIqXVaa	Apparently not to many people. This new guy came to our school (high school) a few months ago and he's got a pretty big nose.

7QDYWAkfaa	He might be kind of interested, but most likely he just know what he's doing.
4mzbkw07aa	Do it at a time when nothing bad is going on.  I mean, don't do it during an argument or in the heat of the moment.  Just say "Can we talk about us?"  Then just come out and say "I've been thinking that we should break up because........"  Then basically just make them see that you aren't meant to be together because you're not compatible.  Tell them it's not personal, you just can't see yourself with them long term.  Agree to be friends and not talk trash about each other.  End it on a good note and be civil.|`|pdj7ZsBvaa	ummmmmmmmm.<br>  <br>  be like "hey i want to break up"<br>  <br>  lol orrrrrrrr<br>  <br>  "i've really have had a good time dating you and your really nice but i think we would be better as friends."<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	Tell them "Shove off I don't want to see you again". Oh....nicely....try "I think we should be just friends"
Qd8aqvVuaa	Hi naomi<br>  <br>  I'm real sorry to hear you're having to go through all of that alone. I know it's been real tough on you, and it would be great if your family is around, but they're obviously off dealing with their own shock and issues tis has brought up.<br>  <br>  What i can say, is that you need to give yourself as much time as you need, regardless of what other family members say or think of you. if you don't heal properly now, you will carry it around for a long time. Better to do it once and do it right.<br>  <br>  you're best ally here will be friends (if you feel comfortable talking to them) or a professional counsellor.<br>  <br>  Let go of the expectations of the future, no one knows what the future will hold. Be true to yourself in the present moment, and you will always be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck and god bless|`|lGdzb8aqaa	<a href="http://www.siawso.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.siawso.org/</a>

Someone to connect with and feel comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think it's chemistry.

How do you feel about having an online friend?|`|ZO6QXAY5aa	Close friends are everything...but one hard thing that you have to learn is that people are in your life for seasons. It's really sad but eventually the season passes. I totally understand you. That has happened to me so many times but I have learned just to look forward to the people in my future and treasure the current friends I have. *Hugs* It will be ok:)|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I don't think your cursed hun, your just having a hard time with maintaining your friends for reasons that you can't control. I know it hurts when a friend moves away and you feel lonely or if you have a fight with a different friend and you don't get along anymore. I think that you just need to take a little time to cry it out. Don't think that you won't ever make friends again because you will you are just going through a rough patch right now.|`|b3BoOmojaa	OMG you sound just like me...and I completely understand. To be quite honest I just cried a minute ago because I am afraid to lose more friends.  This has happened to me throughout my childhood life and really sux because I get lonely and just want to have that one good friend who is reliable and I can talk to.  This has affected me more than ever now because it is hard to trust and i can not get attached to someone or else I feel that they will move or leave me. But you can not let this happen to you or else you will have grudges against people and you will be hopeless.  You need to have a group of friends, gain a strong relationship and keep pushing for the friendship :) Good Luck!|`|bV2zUNtkaa	This is really sad,your not alone,MY best friend in the UNIVERSE moved to ohio,What converts me is that I know that my friend is helping Other people have happy days,remember friends come and go!<br>  Good friends are hard to find,just remember the good times you had.Someone else is have that good time now. and im sure you have more friends that you pal with try to get closer to more then one person,if you have more then one friend one friend leaving wont be so bad! i hope i helped.<br>  <br>  -TE-Zenmori<br>  .P.S.

ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	That sounds really nice...I think they would appreciate that or you might want to get them and yourself a bracelet or necklace that signifies your friendship for life.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I have two great friends who are my bridesmaids.  We live in PA but getting married in Vegas.  I bought them both a large Lands End bag for a carry on the plane with their names embroidered, I bought their jewelry, carry on sized bottles for shampoo(like a kit), and a personalized picture frame thanking them.  When I asked them to be bridesmaids, I bought them Willow Tree angels, the "thank you" one.  Good luck.|`|JrVhTyLdaa	You can find some very nice gifts for these special ladies if you take a look at<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/Bridesmaid_Gifts-38-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/B...</a>|`|IUYpGvCXaa	The spa idea is soooo nice...perhaps to even set up appointments for a couple of days after your wedding...so that while you are off relaxing and enjoying your honeymoon after all of the big day stess...they can somewhat do the same!  They will deserve it!!  I also like the idea of an engraved or special piece of jewelery that only the three of you will share.|`|7qfGWpaqaa	I bought my girls a pewter rose with a little charm that said " My Bridesmaid, My Friend" with our wedding date. I also bought them their  jewlery for the wedding day and made them a little makeup bag with lotion,lipstick,hairspray all that kinda stuff!|`|EGao9rQKaa	i like genelle's idea :)|`|qjQbIxsMaa	My cousins did baskets for her wedding. She made a little bag up that suited each person. My mum read at her wedding so she got quilting supplies. One of her friends who was a beauty queen type got a spa basket. It shows you know them and you can't feel free to throw in cheap stuff as long as it all adds up to around the same tab.
kSCSuMBDaa	i would tell her that u dont want her to come cause she sounds like a pretty moody person lately, sho knows, maybe she has reasons as to y she is treating u that way, not that its rite or anything, but yeah just talk to her one on one and tell her how u feel, trust me ull feel much better. Lemme no how it goes!|`|CO1CiN6Haa	Sounds like a lot of drama to me. You both sound like you are being rude to each other. It is never good to be rude. I think you should be kind to her and include her just like you want to be included. If she is rude, you do not have to be. It will work out. Just give it time. You will be glued at the hips again, if at least one of you can keep your cool. Take the higher road.|`|uEWZSVwyaa	dont bite your tounge it a begin to hurt|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	it's time for the two of you to go your own ways.  don't discuss your events any more to her.  enjoy your life away from her.  you have your own life, go and live it.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	move on.
AA12129504	Ah. That's a hard one. <br>  I remember a few years ago my boyfriend made a comment on how dark I was... not in a good way though... I didn't realized it but it did not look good. Plus the tanning bed I was using was not good quality.<br>  <br>  Hopefully she will realize what she is doing to herself. Unfortunately since her mom is into tanning all the time then i'm afraid your girlfriend isn't going to stop since this is what she had grown up with.|`|AA12035186	She may be addicted to tanning.  Really.  You may have to break up and tell her the real reason.  You'll be saving her life too.  It's not a matter of if you will get skin cancer when you tan that much, it's when.|`|mdE1HXMkaa	I've actually heard that somehow (??) tanning is actually addictive. Unbelievable. I suggest start her on a crack/meth habbit to distract her from her tanning.|`|T12qECtnaa	Yeah people who fake bake look ridiculous and will look even worse in the future!  Possibly if you mention that that's the reason for breaking up on her she would stop because she may realize how it really is a stupid thing to overdo|`|Cn6UklwGaa	well i would break up with her. does she know how dangerous and bad that is for your health?<br>  <br>  help me?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjOI.EaZAFfav6EPDa8HmkzD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226204742AAIUT5L">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|VHi7Kaokaa	tannorixic...<br>  yes very addictive.<br>  just tell her how you feel , talk to her before you do anything you'll regret|`|p7izYNBpaa	juat do it and dont second guess what you want to do.|`|ze4Gt1araa	That's messed up if she likes to tan than let her tan tell her you don't like that she looks bad like that and maybe she'll stop and if she doesn't leave her because maybe she's one of those people that the more you tell her to not do it she wants to do it more. Let it go and when she sees you drop it she'll end up stopping.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|rTaaIXSuaa	It sounds like she is addicted to tanning. People can be addicted to the most weirdest stuff and not just drugs and alcohol.<br>  If she doesn't seem to care about your concerns, do you think this relationship is worth staying in?<br>  Give her a choice. You love her and are concerned she is taking this tanning thing to the extreme. She either stops or the relationship does.<br>  Hopefully that will open her eyes and maybe give her some thought.|`|93e28c7a08b65069e3d97c485ab2a6fdaa	im just answering because i used to tan all the time ,but now i cant afford it,but to some a tan body is pretty,and i know she doesnt do it all the time because the most you can tan is 30 min. (if that )every 24hrs.,and i know 30min. a day isnt messing up your scheduale with her,give her some air man|`|JI6IYe9Aaa	threaten her first,<br>  if i were you just be like stop of i WILL break up with you,<br>  its not because you dont look good,<br>  its that its gonna hurt you in the long run,<br>  and because your addicted.<br>  so if you dont quit or dont simmer down on it then we through. <br>  <br>  then if she doesnt, then break up with her.<br>  and after that she will prolly quit and crawl back to you. lol.|`|NyFr2RQNaa	its possible she could stop, but i have a lot of friends who look fried because of tanning and wont stop<br>  maybe dropping her is the best solution|`|KSK22vHUaa	If she'd rather tan than have you, let her have a tan.  She'll find someone who likes her dark skin, and she'll enjoy her skin cancers eventually.|`|L8J5nNjDaa	I never seen your girl, but i agree, she looks disgusting! anyone, ANYONE who enjoys orange skin is gross!|`|219Mkbtqaa	Tanning is addicting. I know...I'm slightly addicted, but I limit myself because I don't want to age that quickly and get all wrinkly so soon. <br>  <br>  I think she would call you shallow and an asshole if you broke up with her because of that reason.  I assume she was tanning when you started dating her...and it's not a new thing right?? Sooo don't break up with her b/c of the tanning... talk to her about it.. don't straight up tell her how bad it is b/c she probably won't listen.  Just maybe drop hints..and you could like find an old picture of her before she was super tan and tell her how beautiful she looks in that picture. She will get the hint if she's a smart girl...|`|eODQG80Uaa	wow, thats terrible. yes i remember one time, my gf kept going to the skatepark and i was like seriously will you please stop it was like a every day thing and guys there will like ******* attack her. there will be like a group of 21 guys following her around and she wont do anything but that doesn't stop them. i told her to stop. she didn't. i tried explaining it. didn't matter, i broke up with her for that reason, let her know, she really liked me, cried, we got back together about a month later and now she listens to me and we've been going out about 8 1/2 months. ( on june 12th 9 months ) i got it good lol. Good luck dude, also age, and how much you like eachother matter A LOT. good luck. i say break up with her.  or atleast tell her your thinking about it.if she really likes you she'll stop. i think thats disgusting i would hate my gf to tan! lol that sucks.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	WOW.. i think it's sick to do that...i'm a 21yr old lady, i hate getting a fake tan..<br>  <br>  Talk to her, show her some slide show on the side effects of Tanning and show her some pictures of people that have a tanning addiction..<br>  really it would help..<br>  If it doesn't u should break up with her for it, tell her u can't take it no more, u like natural woman not fake people..<br>  she might wake up by than and stop her tanning..<br>  <br>  hope it works..<br>  Good luck|`|42f2awEAaa	wait, do you not like it because she'd rather tan than do things with you? or do you not like it because you think she'd look less attractive once she aged because of the tanning? <br>  <br>  if it's the former of the two, then she's being selfish in spending more time on herself despite your concerns. if it's the other option, it's superficial of you to dump her over something stupid like that.<br>  <br>  if you're that concerned about her tanning, i'd suggest buying her a sunless tanner, [ those lotions you can buy that give you a temporary tan] so that she can get the color she wants without damaging her skin. if she still doesn't like it, take her to a dermatologist so that she'd get some real advice on how harmful the sun is to her.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  p.s. please answer my question<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar0OPe1gmBM2sp5PlVpRdOfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226205556AAtsFxd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|iOJH7SP6aa	No she wont stop. Think about it like any other addiction, smoking drinking drugs.<br>  You've told her your concerns. She doesn't seem to care. Ask if she can do something alternative, like the spray tan or tanning lotions. Or at least use the lotion and cut the tanning time in half... something.<br>  Tell her she would look more beautiful natural skin tone...<br>  If it really bothers you tell her you cant be with someone who doesnt consider your feelings, this takes it off the trivial problem onto a serious one.<br>  if she still wont listen... it's time to move on|`|D1xvJXdSaa	I don't think she would stop tanning if you broke up with her, whether it was over the tanning or not.  Tanning is a addiction of hers and if she is feeling down about a breakup then she will turn to her addiction even more..... I think you should keep trying with her and get her to slow it down at least.|`|kNLi16C6aa	Ewwww leather skin..<br>  ...if you don't like look of it, then she's not the one for you.<br>  She obviously doesn't care about your opinions or concerns.<br>  <br>  I don't think she'd stop after you broke up with her, as she doesn't care now what you think...why would she all of a sudden change?|`|YvJdkSNaaa	If you tell her you'll dump her because she tans, she'll probably dump you.  Get her a bottle of self-tanner, and act all lovey-dovey concerned about her health.  You may even want to mention that you have an "aunt who died of skin cancer" or something.  I agree with you though, it's gross.|`|mk5FcPVqaa	if she loves u shell stop everyone has imperfections thatu have to deal with but if her really bother u that much that u wanna break up w/ her then i would|`|fjLluy2baa	i would if i were you she is going to look like a leather bag when she gets older  ...think about the old woman in ,there's something about Mary|`|lQ2pLL2Yaa	maybe u should jut talk 2 her about it. be honest but not mean about it. she will greatly appreciate that u said something about it 2. hope all goes well. :)|`|GLsFpVCoaa	she might but tanning isnt healthy so this might just be a good thing for her... dont like mega hurt her but definately break up to show her how serious you are|`|e6FmNSfxaa	Yes, I do. Be sure to say that her excessive tanning is making her look disgusting.|`|f59097c269f6c0cecb2a5af09684bf10aa	Have you told her it disgusts you??? And that its tacky?
POFdWpUzaa	The adults should have given the girls the tools to come together as a loving family. The adults need to be disciplinarians and role models for their children. The adults need to set limits for acceptable behavior. None of this has happened. No one should intervene on this family unless the adults seek professional help for their family. There is nothing you can do other than be a loving and supportive family member. The adults need to grow up and help their children adjust to life's challenges. These little girls are miserable not because of each other, but because their parents are not parenting them. These little girls have no limits set for them, they don't know the acceptable boundaries because no one has taught them. It's up to parents to teach and guide and mentor their children. When children are left to make decisions for themselves, chaos ensues, because the children don't have the experience or knowledge to make those decisions. Also, it's very confusing for small children to be asked to make decisions, even the smallest decisions, like what would you like for dinner? No, you don't ask a child, you feed the child the best food you can. This is also a metaphor for how to raise a child in all areas. Don't give them too many choices, give them the best you can in the way of guidance and love and mentoring and when they are old enough to make choices more often than not they will be able to make good choices because of what the adults gave them early on.|`|yV8fog7Paa	Explain to your daughter that the other daughter is ill and needs to rest--and when she is having a better day find something none-exhausting to do such as play-dough or coloring or watching a movie together. Bring your daughter somewhere special--she is going through a hard time as well.  Take her somewhere she loves to go but explain to her before not to tease jade.|`|MTcFC9ccaa	The issue is most likely that each girl was used to being the center of their parents attention (evidenced by how spoiled you say they are) and now they have to share them will two other people, one of which is another little girl.  They see each other as a direct threats.  Nicole is probably too young to understand the seriousness of Jade's disease.  She simply sees that Nicole is getting even more attention and she is getting that much less.  The parents need to devote time to Jade.  Her acting out is her way of letting them know she feels neglected.  You can help out by spending time with Jade alone doing something she enjoys, and not mentioning her sister while you do it.
EZKe92TTaa	I think any way to strengthen friendship bonds is to spend time together, to discover things in common in your life. You can meet someone, have great chemistry, but if he/she lives far away it's hard to maintain a steady good connection even though you have the chemistry. I think long distance relationships (romance and regular friendships) are hard, not impossible though. Spend time together, dinner, shopping, movies, parties,  this will give both of you a chance to see what things you enjoy doing together. It gives you a chance to bond, to communicate, while doing enjoyable things. I met a new friend (a neighbor of mine in the next building for years but we never spoke til about 3 years ago when our youngest kids turned out to be in the same kindergarten), we kept bumping into each other, saying hello, exchanging small talk..so one day I invited her family over for dinner. We had chemistry, the families got along, we discovered things we both love (cooking, books, films, having picnics out in nature) and we kept doing those things together. Now it's great between us, we spontaneously come over for coffee when we each need a pick me up. I found a really good friend who is there for me and vice versa.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	The best way to strengthen your friendship with people is to get to know them better and find out if you have common interests with them and if you do just keep hanging out and be a good friend to them. Qualities that people look for in friends are trustworthiness, caring, friendly,funny,loyal, and people that stick up for you. The best thing you can do is just be yourself and show people who you really are.|`|K25Ydvdlaa	loyalty kindness truthfulness whether its good or bad, respect someone you feel you can be yourself when you are around them some one you feel safe to explore new things with, understanding and consistency so you have to spend time together to strengthen a relationship and do things not just go to the movies engage in activities of any kind|`|VAxFUGsfaa	trust and loyalty is the only way to keep any relationship strong... : )

No dude just no.|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Well, you should not ask others opinion, but you must ask yourself, whether you love her or not, if you love her very much and is keen to have a closer relationship with her, why should you bother about her kid.

mCM363I9aa	your right for not accepting but not talking to them sounds harsh<br>  <br>  key word COMMUNICATE|`|PBdPD748aa	perhaps it could be the signals you put out without realising? maybe with the next person you date, make it clear from the start your intentions, so therefore there wont be any misunderstandings or misinterpretations. just try to watch the vibes you put out there. no 'i love you' or things like that too early, perhaps. if you had wonderful relationships, try not to end it because it gets awkward, try and communicate openly and maybe you can salvage it IF thats what you want. good on you for being so independant!|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Rambii, maybe you are a "real catch." <br>  <br>  I think that only knowing someone a month is a little early to get married and spend the rest of my life with you, but I guess it is possible for some guys. Maybe you are too easy-going and tolerant, and willing to put up with too much from them, and you are not expressing your views as to what you want. (Kinda makes me want to take you on a date a see what you are like. But, I am happily married. lol)  Sometimes, there is just no telling what a guy will do, but I  infer that you are desirable enough to keep. So, don't sell yourself short.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|BGIxDWkZaa	First of all, the next date you have, make these feelings known up front. Let them know you are not going to jump right into a marriage. I assume you will eventually try marriage again. Make sure they know up front this is not a rush job on your end. Also make sure they know up front you are not easy. Again I assume you are not. <br>  <br>  You just want to take things one step at a time. If marriage comes, then it does. If not C'est la vie as the French say.<br>  <br>  By the way really like that heart shaped pupil thingy. Photoshop?|`|8i46CxZ0aa	They see the kid and automatically think two thing....A. this woman is easy or B. This woman is looking for an honest man.

Maybe you allow them to get too close too soon and they think it is the next step. Next time instead of avoiding the men, try explaining your situations and asking them to slow down a little. You might find that they were proposing because they thought it was what you wanted.|`|AJUeAPrVaa	It sounds like you must be a very desirable woman. Explain to the guy that you aren't ready for marriage so soon. A reasonable man will understand that.|`|8tMnKEFFaa	Money doesn't by you a ticket to happiness does it? Inner happinessI mean so maybe most just want you for your money.
BQeG9qeRaa	first i would keep in close contact with the social worker of the child support division then take a pen and paper and keep record of every conversation i had the the father ( good & bad) dates, time, etc. and  go talk with the manager of your rental explain that your current lease has another 6 mos. left and briefly tell them the situation and ask if there can be a agreement for early termination of that lease. Besides most managers or property owner do not want to be responsible for any probable law suit that could occur. tell them of the hardship that it will create if they don't terminate your lease
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	men don't  like to admit to anything that might make them appear weak, and men aren't in touch with their emotions like women are. maybe he uses the sarcasms to cover up a low self esteem, or shattered ego. he denied it to avoid how he really feels. u made him feel uncomfortable, putting him on the spot.|`|hs793CCxaa	He doesn't want you to reject him. Why on earth would you ask him like that??|`|cHROCt3Aaa	it is obvious he likes you and is attracted to you but it doesn't seem he is interested in pursuing a long distance relationship.<br>  <br>  keep it the flirtation it is, maybe one day it will turn into something more. if not, have fun with it now ;)|`|RtkB46peaa	You called him out on it in an attempt to embarass him, and he denied it.

POFdWpUzaa	My condolences. <br>  <br>  I think you should help your mom look to the future and brighter days ahead. She and you will always grieve the loss, but maybe she needs to be reminded that you are still here and need her, too. Take her out to lunch, or shopping at the mall, or do something she and you like to do together. Get her head out of her sorrow by giving her some joy. She loves you too, don't forget that. You need her too, don't be so selfless that you someday resent her or your brother for the attention you wanted but didn't get because you didn't ask for it. Your mom needs to take care to be there for you. Remind her gently and lovingly that you still need her by engaging her in your life. The quilt that you mention can be something you and your mom work on together to help you heal together. It will bring about a lot of wonderful conversation between you and a lot of bonding and healing. <br>  Best wishes.|`|xe6wc0jXaa	Sorry for your loss. Very tragic.<br>  I don't know much about quilts so cant really help with that. However, have you thought about doing a "scrapbook" of some sort with photos and stories. Perhaps some of your brothers friends could write something for it as well. That's about all I can come up with for now. Hope this helps.|`|a90d2414a4c76a94b6d06ed42bca2891aa	Good for you.<br>  <br>  I would say, show your Mom a lot of attention. You won't be able to take your Brother's place to her, but you can help your Mom get her mind off the grief.<br>  <br>  She'll get over the trauma in time.<br>  <br>  I lost my Mother in 1952, and I still think of her even today.
BRPA3HtYaa	it sounds like he has a huge crush. i would say talk to this girl and see if she is seeing anyone and if shes single ask if she would mind if you had a friend call? explain that hes a great guy looking for a great girl and let them see if they can talk on the phone..then if they are comfortable they will meet..i dunno but that worked with me and my guy and its been 3 months since..|`|mVg9WaLoaa	in my sight, it is nothing but the magic of love................|`|Jz8S4wrfaa	He obviously has a seriously thing for her.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if he hasn't made any changes, and is still sneaking around and lying to u, then he is still up to something. when someone cheats on u, and they want forgiveness, they have to earn it back, by changing their behaviors. it doesn't matter about finding someone new,what matters is u get to keep your dignity, when u let a man cheat on u, it shows them that they can get away with it. no one young or old enjoys being cheated on and betrayed. sometimes even if your not sure of the future, u have to leave for the principal of a thing.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You could do a trial separation that make wake him up to reality and make him go to counseling with you or else you will be stuck with a cheater. They hardly ever stop on their own it's like an =addiction. <br>  <br>  It's time to do something not just keep putting up with it.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	If you let him get away with it, he's gonna do it again. And sneaky is a sure sign. Yes, you can make it on your own. And will be alot happier. And of course you will find someone new. Someone that will treat you like you want to be treated. Alot better than that. Go for it.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Maybe u can forgive his 'huge mistake', if u love him<br>  but if he still treats u like crap, maybe u should call it quits.<br>  Don't worry about the future, u will find love and happiness somewhere in this wide world, if u seek.|`|0le6RYndaa	Leave him.<br>  <br>  Any person who cheats doesn't deserve to be happy.  Or live for that matter.  Stop torturing yourself.  You deserve better!|`|Ga9oCLavaa	You should find someone else.....he cheated on you, lies to you...thats enough, stop beating yourself up and living in agony|`|99eCtW9baa	sometimes with guys they like have a woman to call there own, but they still don't want to be tied down. when your home with your girl it's almost predicable as what is going to happen. lets be honest it gets dull. while he's in the act of cheating it's exciting knowing your doing something you probably shouldn't be doing and your out still trying to keep your "game" fresh. testing the waters with others females and when it's all said and done he'll probably realize your the best one for him. i know this probably doesn't help much but it's true.|`|7Fc22teCaa	I have been married for 12 years, i was no angel in the beginning of our marriage, i  however openly told my wife everything, we have never looked back.

Yup, but if all is good, they can do the sneaky sneaky bewteen the cheeky|`|2z4aPm0vaa	Yeah, it involves hot dogs and donuts. You can put the rest together.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Yeah most can. Apparently people in wheel chairs are better.|`|370e691422f07fe796ab12f350d57094aa	It is possible,yes.
A94u2In8aa	Yeah you're pretty cute.Love the hair :)|`|37M3dkkRaa	give my bf's hair back plz...he's trying to grow it out for me and you just stole it! you don't look bad, but you're not my type really.|`|eF2OkxMqaa	you're not too bad. 7.|`|NaKpEWTdaa	Like totally.
A94u2In8aa	Call her.Calling a girl makes it more personal and lets her know you're interested.Texting is something you do with your buddies.If you feel uncomfortable calling her then send her a text but add "ill call you later" at the end.Sending a casual text may make her think you dont wanna take things further.For a first date a picninc at the park should be nice.Or maybe bowling.Make it fun and not too formal.First dates are basically meant for getting to know each other better so let her get to know you.You can expect a kiss at the end of the date or a peck on the cheek depending on how it goes but don't be too disappointed if you dont get one because many women have a "dont kiss on the first date" kinda rule.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	Take her out to a nice but comfortable place. And start with texting, if the conv. gets longer then ask if its ok for you to call her instead. Dont call too much though.|`|8SRjELNBaa	I've got the best solution;<br>  <br>  first text, basic "hi", "how are you doing" sort of stuff, then as you get to begin a conversation via texting, send her a text "hey, is it okay if i call you instead? Texting isn't my thing."<br>  <br>  Flawless<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|n90KqgAEaa	you should call her, it makes a good conversation and texting, well, u never know who's reading the texts. ( i know someone who's mom reads their texts.) Once ur ready to tell them, speak with them face to face.|`|22hX0vDNaa	i prefer texting, and you guys should go eat lunch together, you can bring other friends to not make it awkward|`|zWiU19BWaa	flip a coin?
AA11969451	He's into water sports and trust you enough to let you in on the secret.|`|d0fLx0LPaa	Okay I would be a little worried. If he's bringing up someone else he still has vivid memories of this person and will use it against you to make you feel like you're obligated to do things you may not be comfortable with or that he wants you to do, or he's not over that other person.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	he's saying to you, baby i love you like a toilet i used to date.|`|lg6jexk7aa	That is quite an unusual request.  Maybe it is a fetish of some kind?|`|3xMo7bGkaa	That's sexual disorder called urophilia. <br>  <br>  Read this article at<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.saferinjecting.net/sex-urophilia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saferinjecting.net/sex-urophi...</a>|`|99eCtW9baa	sounds like you got an R.

fuia2Z6Maa	that sounds strange... looks like he doesnt need ur opinion at all
u0udwkZQaa	This is why man. Look here. These anonymous girls don't even want to answer you straight about a hypothetical situation, what chance is there for a girl to actually commit to a phonecall? It's not you it's them. They are scared, they have all this stuff going through their head, they don't know what they want, they don't know how to feel about things let alone what to do so the easy thing is do nothing. You've got to give her excuses to contact, so it looks like she's not committing much, or just do everything. As long as she's not running away, chances are she's going along with it.|`|ywKXxSRGaa	Well, maybe a bit, but maybe she is shy and doens't have the guts to call you. IM not sure how old you are,  but if she is young, she just may not have the confidence in calling you. <br>  <br>  if your in the popular crowd and she is not. she may be worried that its a game or a bet. <br>  <br>  maybe send her a note asking for her number and telling her that you will call her. and if you say you will. Call her!!!  <br>  <br>  it will mess with her mind if you say you will and dont!|`|du5MNrQ6aa	clearly you are conceited.|`|ozBkHxuHaa	Clearly you're not a woman.|`|XgYg5BB3aa	Clearly you should try talking to me casually before giving me your number... I'm probably too hesitant to actually call you because I think you already expect me to be into you just cause you caught me looking at you a few times in class.|`|A94u2In8aa	Shes probably just nervous.Give her some time and don't rush it.If he doesn't respond ask her why she never called.Also..are you sure aren't misreading the signs?|`|lfMJPZ67aa	She well I am wondering why is this hot guy asking me to call him, he must be playing games with me.|`|A8NBQR3iaa	Shes to scared!

LOL|`|99eCtW9baa	i can't help you on your question, but i feel left out older couples are getting more than i am....does that make me a loser or are older people hornier??
2nuWLmrIaa	wtf? that is absurd your not some pet in his little wack life|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Yeah that is pretty weird. He sounds a little controlling actually and he isn't even your boyfriend. This is your family and if you want to spend time with them you have every right. He is acting pretty selfish.
JKwOONBEaa	whenever you feel tempted to masturbate<br>  do a activity to get your mind of it<br>  maybe shoot some hoops at a park or go for a walk<br>  getting a gf will help you alot so try to get one<br>  and usually when i masturbate bad things happen<br>  so i dont anymore<br>  i tell myself god wants me to wait till im a bit older.|`|IKq25y8faa	well im a girl im 18, before i use to masterbate like 5 times a day!!! crazy, when i was like 16, but now i have a boyfriend, and well i guess it does help, i dont really masterbate much anymore because im always ALWAYS busy, but i still like doing it! so you just have to find things that will keep your mind of it, eventho masterbating is healthy for you, whether your christian or not :)|`|1IUZpHwzaa	Masturbation is naturally and healthy for you, it decreases the chance of getting a yeast infection because its a natural way to clean your penis out.|`|fTjG1KGLaa	dude, just masterbate as much as you want lol. its natural and fun. then just start hitting on random girls and see if they like you. then masterbate in them lol|`|ozBkHxuHaa	Um, I don't know ANY guys who are 'getting rewards' for masturbating. At most, they're getting caught by their mothers, creating awkward moments, or getting yelled at by their girlfriends who feel their boyfriends 'shouldn't need to' since he has a girlfriend. Of course I'm a girl but have been blessed, or cursed with all of my friends being male, all from different religious backgrounds, all the way from atheist to catholic. Lucky for you, they talk to me about everything. <br>  From what I gather, none of them gave up studying or playing sports. To you have some friends you can hangout with? BMX biking, or paint balling?<br>  Also, your young! So young! Granted, only a handful of years younger than me, but still. Male sex drive is at it's peak at 18 yrs old! Hormones are crazy right now for you, so if you feel the need to, do, just don't let it consume your life. That might be a bad track, but it's completely normal. <br>  As for the christian thing... Now that's tricky. Everytime relgion is involved things get tricky, but what do you think? Do you really feel that God doesn't want you to do that? I mean, it's better then having premarital sex, right? And isn't there a possibility that God has a few other more pressing matters to attend to, like war, famine, etc.? <br>  My guy friends all ranged from a few times a day to a few times a week at your age. Now they're all either too busy with girlfriends, or jobs or school that it takes a backseat. Don't Worry! It's not that bad, and it gets easier. <br>  If it's still bothering you, try asking an older male that you're comfortable with and ask him. No doubt he's been through it.<br>  Good Luck.|`|8AqePkCqaa	There's no reason not to do it. It feels good better than getting a girl pregnant right. Keep it up til your mature for a girlfriend and don't stress over what it can do. It doesn't give you bad luck. It releases tension. Just make sure whatever work you need to do is done before you start. Have fun. Do as much as you like I do everyday and I'm a women|`|574eb859c301df997d80bbd93890321faa	Just do it. Everybody does it but nobody talks about it. Only worry if it starts to affect your daily life. I'm sure God would be alright if it meant you weren't partaking in premarital relations.|`|FXadJ1kNaa	well i might only be 14 but i know a lil somein somein what i do iz i Limit mysel to 1 a week and dont have bhaad luck try avoiding any ting that gives u a *****|`|fjAdjVhkaa	OMG! Just because you are a christian doesnt mean you cant masturbate. I am a girl and I do it all the time. You wont feel as embarrassed by it when u get older. I used to be embarrassed when I was younger, but now I know it is ok and normal. Dont start having unhealthy thoughts about sex now, you will have them for the rest of ur life. Jesus died for your sins, right? That's not something I think you would be punished for and people who tell you that you will are just uncomfortable with their own sexuality.|`|hCpqhn27aa	Guys don't just not masturbate. It's not a moral issue, it's a biological process. Stuff builds up down there and needs to be released. Also, once a day is average, so you're like a friggin' monk if you're doing once a week. Though I'm not a Christian, the only way I can think of that masturbating would be consistent with the purity concepts in Christianity would be if you got married and only thought about you're wife when you did it. But the fact is, you're not going to stop and it wouldn't be good for you if you did. (Men who don't masturbate often have health problems, including considerably higher rates of heart failure, higher stress rates, poorer immune systems, higher chance of prostate disease, and even weird crap you wouldn't think of, like a poor sense of smell.) Really, you might as well try to stop eating.|`|sxahupRTaa	Well, the answer to your question is a complex one. It appears obvious that you have never been talked to about sex when you were younger. In my personal opinion there is absolutely nothing wrong with masturbation. Most people do it. Some people will tell you that it is a sin. The reality is that the definition of sin is so warped and twisted in today's society most people don't actually know what a sin is anymore. Murdering someone, that's a sin. Hating people because they are different from yourself, that's a sin. Now, I wouldn't suggest having sex until personally you are ready and educated about the dangers of STD's and teen pregnancy and the importance and proper use of condoms and the viable option of abstinence. The idea of the loving God that Jesus portrays in the New Testament sending you to a eternal damnation for masturbating is laughable. Rest assured my friend that sexual experimentation is normal. All people do it and there is nothing "unholy" or "wrong" with it or you. See the link below for some more information.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	It's a natural thing, healthy, normal and fun.  Everyone does it, because that's the way we were made.  It has nothing to do with religion, it's all about biology, but if it makes you feel better it really is the way god made us.<br>  <br>  It's all pro, and no con...just be discreet and clean up after yourself.

Well, your options are obviously limited. You could have sex in the dressing room at a clothing store. You could go to the mall or some place where they have a "family bathroom." You know those one stall bathrooms that are huge so a stroller can fit? You could sneak him over to your house or vice versa. Any place you are gonna have sex is just gonna have to be secretive. Depending where you live, you could go down to the beach or lake or something at night. Other than that, I can't think of anywhere else you could go. If you have a friend who your comfortable with and their parents' work at night or something, you could go over there. If either of you have a shed in the backyard, you could do it there. Good luck..

IU4uNH97aa	I have 10 siblings so obviously they were really busy.<br>  <br>  I remember as a kid me and my sister hid in my parents' bathroom one night cause my brother told us that if we could stay awake all night in the washroom something really cool would happen in the morning. So were sitting there and we fall asleep i wake up to this moaning and all those kinds of noises. We go and investigate in my parents' room and my moms giving my dad head. My sisters like ' Mommy, why are you eating daddy ? ' I still remember it, gawd that was like 20 years ago.<br>  <br>  When i was a teenager one night i wanted the car and go upstairs to my parents room to ask. I knocked and am standing there waiting, all i hear is grunting and ' OH YEAHS ' but my younger brother comes up behind me and knocks even louder.My mom replies between moans to ' COME BACK WHEN WERE FINISHED ' it was so gross. i just turned around and walked to my room.|`|WtjsgMkLaa	Ew, hahah, i have!<br>  Well, I haven't seen or heard them, but I know they're having sex when my mom makes the cat leave the bedroom.<br>  lmao. oh god, just the thought gives me chills.....|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Thankfully not lol|`|eGPZpfr5aa	no but my mom has a boyfriend and one night me and my sister swore that we heard them doin it|`|kU0pC50Uaa	ew ew ew ew just thinking about brings back the horrible images (shudders) yes i have it was so gross like cause i just walked in to ask a question and there they were (shudders again) blaaaahhhh i was like oh my god ewwww and like ran quickly out of the room and silently closed the door. I have never looked at them in the same way since and whenever they kiss or hug or somthing i just get so grossed out now.|`|bOvx199Saa	no ive neva heard them or saw them havin sex<br>  bt i remember wakin up in the middle of the nite n ma mom seemed to have just had a shower her hair was wet n dad was still having a shower !!!<br>  idk if they were 2gther or its just a co incedince|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Never caught them but I used to hear their bed creaking when their room was next to mine Ughhhh.

I woke up in the middle of the night, and heard moans and grunts and crap. I wrote it in my Diary. A couple weeks ago I cleaned my room and found it. I laughed so hard.

They put us to watch TV and my sister was being a real jerk, and started hitting me and such.  So I ran for my parents' room, the door was locked.  So I picked it (it was an easy lock) and... wow.  My eyes must have popped out of my  head.  I think I was 7?  8?  I turned and ran in their bathroom and yelled "she's gonna kill me!" and locked myself in there.  <br>  <br>  They weren't mad, just... very very embarrassed.  And angry at her.
Ifczxi6gaa	Okay your brother was like me. I am 20 and I just finished high school.<br>  I had troubles with marihuana weed pot. I tried smoking it in he house in the bathroom with a vent on. But my parents would find clues in the bathroom like a lighter or a odor. Anyway one time they found my stash, beat me up , my dad tried kicking me out, he was pushing me out the door but my mom stopped him. I am in debt right now for 2 years with my visa from ebay spending and It is very hard paying it when my parents don't wanna help me.<br>  Your brother is living the life. His parents spoiled him<br>  My dad is never happy with me until I go beyond expections.<br>  First he thought I wasn't gonna finish high school, now I'm done, but now he thinks I can't do college, but I already got accepted and I want to try. <br>  Your brother needs to quit smoking and live up to his responsbitilys before it's too late!!! Good luck
fjAdjVhkaa	Honestly, if you think so and feel so, go with your gut. Yes, sounds like he does. Always listen to your gut with men.|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	yes|`|B4V0tbQ5aa	well, if she had a family crisis or something, your bf's actions could be justified. if not, he likes her.you should talk about this with him
cCymTwdcaa	You are very observant! When something is wrong, I usually act like nothing is, but feel horrible. I tend to not speak as well as usual, almost nervously to the person or people involved, yet sometimes I am able to keep cool. I also tend to avoid the person until I have sorted it out, or if they are around, I avoid eye contact and "keep busy."|`|8jKtAMkjaa	What I do when something is wrong is pretend nothing is. Usually, I'm scared or insecure in public places (including school) but when something is PARTICULARLY wrong, I'll keep my composure and get away from whatever has frightened me as fast as I can. So I suppose maybe I walk faster than usual?
P8CBDLiKaa	If you want to keep them as a friend...yeah.  It was an accident, right?<br>  <br>  Any other option loses a friend and gains you nothing.<br>  <br>  Now, if it happens a second time, all bets are off.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think you should probably forgive them because everyone makes mistakes but I would still probably be a little upset since they were not being responsible with my belongings. Just forgive them, it's not worth fighting over.|`|UobA5ebEaa	IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT IT WAS AND HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS.    IF IT DIDMT COST ALOT FORGET IT BUT IF IT WASA EXPENSIVE THEN THEY SHOULD PAY|`|SCcFZy5jaa	Ofcourse,forgive and forget !!!!!
RvddYKqjaa	So often people come on and make their mates sound horrible. Of course everyone believes a one-sided story. I appreciate that you have given both sides of the story. I would guess you have to start over again and prove yourself to her. How does she know you won't lie again, or cheat, or take drugs? How can you teach her to believe that you are sincere?  It won't be easy. At least from what you say, I do believe there is something to save here. She doesn't "think" you can do anything to make her change, but at least she didn't say it can't happen. You may be given a second chance, and you'd better not mess up again. Your daughter needs both of you, but she needs you only if you can be a real father and husband to her mom. Tell her all the things you are saying here. Ask if you can have another chance, and tell her you know this will be the last one. As long as one of you really wants to work things out, there's always hope. <br>  Personally, I think you might succeed this time. Be patient with her. She has a lot of history to forgive. I really truly, wish you an honest opportunity to start over again.|`|YAJsQDX8aa	Man, I know this isn't what you wanna hear, but after being gone 4 a min, you said she barely touches you and rolls over, that sounds like cheating behavior to me.<br>  As much as you may want to work it out, she has to wanna do it to,<br>  <br>  you should watch that new movie ( a few weeks old) called fireproof,<br>  its exactly what you are going thru,<br>  its not the best quality in the world, but the storyline fits 4 you.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	Matt you have messed your own life up and shes done. it has taken her long while but shes done. you have to accept it and move on also. yes you may have done tthis but too late. i guess you just give her her freedom and find someone else. you will have to support the girl but you have to move and and learn from this situation. i am sorry take care and good luck|`|BOgfHEqqaa	I think that the best (possibly only) thing left to do is seek professional counseling. It can open up your relationship and if the counselor is good, will help you learn about yourself and each other. Good luck.|`|i2cZDC81aa	That's a hard question to answer. If she feels numb, I mean, I wouldn't want to be in a marriage with someone who doesn't love me. There is someone out there for everyone. Maybe she needs some excitement in her life. She needs to feel beautiful and loved. Try to do everything you can without smothering her to make her a happy wife if you don't want to lose her. If she doesn't give in, then maybe there really is someone better for you out there.<br>  <br>  It's very hard to love fully after someone cheats on you. So good luck. I hope you both find happiness.|`|sKu21AJlaa	I don't know what to say except it seems like she's a wonderful woman...and you blew it.  Most women wouldn't even give you a second chance after cheating.  If she did, she probably still had anger deep down, and this is how she's dealing with it.  Can you blame her for not wanting to get close to you?  You broke her heart, and she doesn't want to trust you again.  I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  The only thing you can do is try to make some arrangement best for your daughter.  If your wife wants a divorce, that's out of your control. You can't change someone's feelings.|`|B24KqmgGaa	Where were you?  Rehab?  The poor woman has been thru hell with you.  Can you blame her?  She has gotten used to life with out you and maybe she is happier.  That was the old you...so now you have to let her see what living with the new you is like.  I bet she loves you very much.  Give her time and treat her like she needed to be all those times before|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	This is a tough one, Counseling, prayer, time to rebuild trust( if she'll give it to you) You dug your own grave with this one. I love my husband desperately, if he cheated on me that would be it nothing short of God would make me stay.The thought of cheating physically disgusts me.|`|vVZLFPtRaa	well what lies ahead the curb is nothing but good my man keep trying the Pasteur said one time if you don't love your spouse then you don't love yourself so First continue to stay clean try new thing ask her if she wants Back rubs with oil take her out plan a trip that will take her mind of thing if all else fails you tried Hope it helps Juicy OATS|`|P8v8nkqdaa	Sounds like nothing's going to change her mind.  You'll have to move on.  The more you fight it the worse it'll be for you.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	Others have said it, but you need to hear it one more time...<br>  <br>  Marriage Counseling.<br>  <br>  Men are usually too "proud" to do this. If you love her as much as you say you do, GO.|`|qFqDHYivaa	Be real|`|cSPxoFe6aa	dont cheat that will help|`|1bubNOQmaa	Wow.  That is a tough situation.  I'm glad to see you are getting your life back on track, and congratulations to you for that.  I seriously suggest counseling if she is willing to try that.  Also, ask her if she might, for the sake of your marriage and your daughter, give you some time to win her trust back.  Probably deep down she still loves you but is afraid to risk being hurt again.  You wounded her deeply and have to show that you now have the courage, the integrity, and the love to make amends to her and to not ever do it again.<br>  <br>  However, if she is unable to give you that time, you have to respect her wishes in the situation.  Sometimes we can be hurt so much by a person that there is no going back.|`|tEy9hvebaa	1) I'm NOT catholic, I'm almost an agnostic...<br>  <br>  but<br>  <br>  2) there is a program called Retrouvaille kinda associated with the Catholic Church... but it did a WORLD of good getting me and my wife back together and our marriage on track<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.retrouvaille.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.retrouvaille.org/</a><br>  <br>  you'll start with a "weekend" and there are follow ups... well worth the time and trouble... I think it saved our marriage.|`|9bz6EpoLaa	a woman can only take so much! after all that, her feelings OF COURSE have gone away. the person she fell in love with has betrayed, deceived, and embarrassed her. May just be time to end it. Make sure you're a good DAD regardless of what happens though! Good luck|`|2L6SQaw2aa	tell her you love her<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArVW3yakF6pDGDGQlR5Fpyfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226194206AA6M4BA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QCwIueTfaa	wow. what can I said but I guess you tell her that you still love her and tell her how you really feel about her. If that don't work i guess i don't know sorry i cant help much.. i hope everything go well.|`|BGIxDWkZaa	Try marriage counseling. That is if she will agree to go. The only suggestion I have at this point. Trust has been broken, and it will take a long time to mend that. If it can even be mended.|`|N3NKLp1Xaa	she prob doesnt trust that you went away and didnt cheat on her or anything.. tell her before she makes any decisions ask why she wants one.. and if its just cuz of trust ask if shell go to marriage counsuling and she if they can try and make her trust you again|`|oHGmXlE6aa	Very rhetorical answer, go to consoling.|`|6vgTVPtEaa	maybe talk about going to counseling and try to see if you to can get anything out of it???? and good job about changeing ur ways koodos|`|B5N5K1Rzaa	Well i think that you only love her know cause she  wants to leave you. If you really love someone you would NEVER do anything to Heart them. i think what goes around comes around.Not trying to be mean but you should have thought of this before you cheated.<br>  Maybe she just cant stop thinking of the fact you cheated on her i know if my husband were to ever do that to me i would not be able to stay with him.at fist i might think ill get over it but don't think i will.<br>  If she says she has no feelings for you then its going to be hard to get her to change that.you cant make someone love you if its not there then its not.<br>  Maybe you guys are just not meant to be. Also if you guys argue in front of your daughter that's not good for her.|`|BAq1oQZoaa	I would say that first maybe one day you could spontaneously try to be really romantic with her. Maybe take her some roses while she is at work on a friday and then ask her if she would like to go out to eat with you to a nice resturaunt, or maybe even one that has in the past ment something to the both of you, like the place you had your first date or something.<br>  If she wants to go try to just have fun and talk casual. If she doesn't go for the date then make her a nice dinner for when she gets home, maybe have your doughter at the baby sitters. You guys need a good heart to heart. You should tell her exactly how you feel, the whole last four sentences plus more from your heart.<br>  It will probably take time cuz you are going to have to prove yourself trustworthy again, but if it really means that much to you it will be worth it.|`|DHuQtaIZaa	Man I feel for you that's rough. It sounds like you are really trying but you are paying for the mistakes you made in the past. I hate to say that its to late especially since you all have a daughter but it might be. She might be to far gone. But if you haven't tried this yet, then sit her down and let her know your not the same person and tell her how you feel. See how she reacts, and if you think you have a shot, then I would give her a little space dont smother her, but take her out on dates and do little things for her. Make her feel special and make her remember why she fell in love with you in the first place, and maybe those feelings will start to come back. Again I know she is your wife but if you smother her you will only push her away further. And if nothing works then maybe it's time for a divorce, I know that will hurt but it is better to let her go than for her to be miserable and bitter because it will eventually make you miserable.<br>  This is just my opinion, it may not be the best advice, but the best of luck to you.|`|MBlEJ9wlaa	Matt, you have hurt her so much that she is dead inside. Women try to make things work, they do not give up easily and once they have given up, they do not patch up that easily too. If you love truly love her, pray to god, she might thaw, till then do everything you can to make her happy. Trust me she is not happy. I pity you, you have lost the very thing that loved you. Ask her for sometime to work it out, do not force yourself on her.If she still wants a divorce give her at least that with dignity. I hope it all works out for you.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Watch the movie "Fireproof" together, then go on Amazon.com and get the "Love Dare" book that is mentioned (and used by the husband) in the movie. It could do wonders!!! It's going to take time to turn things around and rebuild the trust and affection, but you can with work and patience. It's really great that you realize where you went wrong and that you want to make things work. I wish you luck and I feel for you and for her...and for your girls. Show her your question on here and she might see how sincere you are in making things work and winning her back. :-)|`|W7ESZAWPaa	Help her understand that you don't realize what you have until you lose it.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you love her and describe to her what love means to you. Tell her that she is your best friend. The best marriages are the best friendships.<br>  <br>  Let her know that you are a changed man. If all else fails, ask her to start fresh. Fresh as in putting all of the past behind the both of you and forgetting about everything bad that may have happened.<br>  <br>  And if that fails, tell her you would like to "stay together for the kids." (daughter in your case). Children always have a better life without divorce. If she can agree to that then you have gotten past the first step and can work to make it better from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I wish the best to you...|`|cVM9ON5maa	sit her down and talk to her. Tell her how you feel and tell her you are willing to do anything to work it out. Tell her that you believe that once you love someone you can never actually quit loving them you just simply get fed up or to frustrated. offer to read relationship books together or offer to do marriage counseling. You have to show her you are a different man and you are willing to do whatever it takes to fix your marriage. i suggest finding a baby sitter for your daughter or what not and make dinner for her and ask to talk. get everything out in the open. You have to show her by what ever way you can think of that you are a changed man. Ask her to give you 6 months to prove your love for her and that you have changed and during that 6 months you do everything in your power to show her how you feel and that you want to be a great husband and father. and that if at the end of the 6 months she still feels that way you will sign the papers cause all you want is for her to be happy. i highly suggest offering some kind of counseling. Maybe just so she can tell you care go get some  relationship/marriage books from the library or book store and read them so she can tell you are making an effort. Good luck i hope everything works out!
AA11179585	you're always going to be second guessing your relationships if you aren't happy with yourself. Trust me, I was overweight in jr.high/highschool and I know. But the main thing is- ease into it. Dont just run up to her and spout your love for her. Start off as friends, if you're not already. Let her get to know you. If you open yourself up in a friendly manner, and she gets to know you as a person, then it will be easier to try to transition into dating. As for your siblings, tell them to screw off. Do what makes you happy, only you can do it. As for the girl... good luck, be kind and funny, pay attention to her, but not overly clingy and you should be ok.|`|99eCtW9baa	i don't think they would look down on you for having a girlfriend, maybe tease you a little bite. i think they would look down on you if you had a boyfriend (assuming your a boy). whats the big deal with being BIG. haven't you heard that Bigg people are funnier. look at drew carey he gained weight just for that reason. so go for the girl, get your puppy love on....good luck|`|PumDOQC9aa	If you like her why won't you ask her out . You can aways lose weigh work out.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	If you are concerned about your weight and it stops you from doing things:<br>  1) Eat healthy <br>  2) Exercise<br>  3) You will feel much better and look better. You mentioned it so it must bother you whether you want to admit it.|`|ENCktJmtaa	I don't understand the question. Why does having a family account make you a perv?<br>  Anyways, if you want to date, then date. Don't let other people control your life. To get a girl, just be yourself. The right girl will come along eventually.
OKjwCkgxaa	are you THAT ugly or fat guy and wish for that to happen?|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	I don't think the guys looks matter if the girl is like that they will move from one another regardless. It's called SLUT.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	This is a very idiotic generalization.
Ikd9cppcaa	It's all about the media. Whether it is TV, movies, magazines, or newspapers, they all have skinny girls. Fact is, for most of us we aren't willing to puke up 2 of the 3 meals we eat everyday or be hooked on pills or drugs to be skinny. The best thing you can do is just eat healthy and exercise. You may not be skinny but you will look great in your clothes and feel better about yourself. No amount of complaining will change this.....and one other thing....girls don't realize this but most guys like a curvy girl and not the ones that are anorexic looking with a body of a 12 year old boy.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Because you're all young and immature.  When you get older, personality has a lot more to do with it.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	Is that any different than the comments made after my daughter got bit in the face by a dog... she was putting on shoes when it happened.  So, it is not only those who are a little heavy, but those with any handicap... most of which is not the fault of the person.  A good man will get to know the person inside, the outside can change at the blink of an eye.|`|eF2OkxMqaa	Most people see overweight individuals as people with no self respect and no restraint.<br>  They also just find excess fat on a person to be repulsive.|`|y2Uks58paa	there is plenty of guys who like bigger girls, they're just harder to come by. but yeah society conformed us into this way of thinking ,magazines,tv shows,commercials,etc.
AA10504387	Girl, you just need to give him encouragement.  Really evaluate this guy - what do you value, does he value the same things? If you find you really like who he is, then assume he already is interested, and take it to the next level.  The easiest way to do this is by touching him on the arm, smiling at him, and engaging in eye contact.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	Sure if you wanna get to know him why not. Go for it.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Because he can hide behind the screen. Hes two faced. I wouldn't consider any type of relationship with him.|`|cnV3iulAaa	LOL. guys are like that... trust me... i have experienced it all... and its only MSN... so dont take it too seriously. and they are the worst on the phone. but if you know he likes you, then there is nothing to worry about. you just have to find that out first.|`|FMKJ5Ejvaa	Maybe he's sarcastic and you're taking it out of context.  Guys your age sometimes act like that when they like you... when talking on AIM say something like, quit being a dick.  he'll get the point you don't like his bullsh*t and you like him with manners.|`|1rvf2Gdhaa	RED FLAG <br>  RED FLAG<br>   do not get involved.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	maybe he has split personalitys . but that's crazy. i wouldnt waste my time with him any further.
naequcqlaa	I truly believe he DOES in fact love you.  Regardless of what they are, what they stand for, they unfortunately are still part of his family, the only family he's known & grown up with.  You certainly live far enuf away, & sure can be grateful for that anyway.  Obviously they are low life people.  He didn't choose his family, he was just born into it & has no control over that fact!  Who even cares what they say.  You know what they are, what they do or do not stand for, but he's kind of stuck w/them.  You're actually fortunate they don't come & visit w/you two!  So they all talk among themselves.  I doubt they even have many if any friends, & if so, they've got to be just like them.  Do you really care what these "creatures" think, say or even care about you?  I sure wouldn't.  It's like consider the source & ignore them.  I would make up my mind just to do your best to shut them out.  I would refuse to accept the unacceptable.  That would mean I would refuse to even waste my time worrying about what they say as you know it's nothing but pure garbage.  Don't even allow them to clutter your mind w/tho'ts about them.  Don't allow them any control at all.  You take control of you & your life w/your husband. Who really gives a hoot what they say or think as it's all between themselves & let it just go round & round their little low life circle.  Don't even stoop to their level of thinking or letting the likes of them upset you.  You KNOW you're far better than that, so just take pride in that fact.  The birds of a feather flock together.  Let the "bird brains" flock together & just fly around in circles.  You just live you life the way you choose & be happy doing it.  Again, refuse to allow them to even take up space in your head as they're sure not worth it.  Go on w/your life & be happy you're far removed from them all.  You've got your husband who loves you, to me that's all that would be of importance.  Live your life in happiness...The best to you, & just turn your other cheek...:)|`|X7i59NeIaa	Grow up sweetie. Give your husband a chance. No matter how rotten they are or how they treat you or him, they are his family. It is very hard to just walk away from your family. I am sure he wants them to love and approve of him so get off his back before he makes you a part of his past. By the way, yes he loves you a lot or he wouldn't be with you against his family. Stop nagging him.|`|PBdPD748aa	calm down firstly. it is okay, you have your husband by your side. these people are crazy - havent you already realised that? i dont understand why you are thinking the things they are saying and believing are logical, rational or true - because they arent!!!<br>  <br>  they obviously do not want what is best for their son, to be a better person, they must fear him, because he is doing better than what they are. they have lost control over him, parents like to see their children as reflections of themselves and when they are nothing alike they dont like it - which ISNT healthy.<br>  <br>  my fiance stopped speaking to his side a year ago - they were always trying to treat him like a child, and they didnt like how much he grew as a person. he has changed so much because he had me to show him a better life, he has a good job now and we are doing really well - before that he was as miserable as hell and in a bad spot - so i really saved him and he thanks me to this day for it. i couldnt give a crap what his parents have to say - they are living in a different world (and nuts too).<br>  <br>  you both really need to cut contact from them - its not healthy and it is affecting you negatively. you dont need that in your life and either does your man. move on. dont let those people influence your life any longer, they are in their own bubble and only care about themselves and those like them. they have no hope and will NEVER change. and that includes they wont change the way they are to you both.<br>  <br>  you have done the right thing by moving away, just because they are related to your husband does NOT mean what they say is justified or how they are is okay. you need to break away from that unhealthy dynamic and become your own family.|`|ZW1xklaAaa	maybe they think you think your above them. sounds like your husband loves you. and its HIS family no matter what he loves them no matter what they do or where they come from|`|kN4EaiUDaa	you have to realize that's still his family. but as you being his wife he needs to put you first. you and your children you will have together will be his immediate family and those people are now considered his extended family. you need to tell him that you don't deserve this type of treatment and you wish he would stand up for you to them. but you also play a role in this. i'm sure you have done something to them to make them dislike you. you said you came from a "good family" so maybe you appear to be alittle stuck up and act like your better than the rest of them. whatever the reason is, maybe you should find out why and change what they don't like about you..unless what they don't like is something rediculous. i wouldnt speak about your relationship with your husband's family through your husband, i would go straight to the source and ask them why they don't like you and try to make the situation better. don't be a wife that tears your husband away from his family. someday if you dont already you'll have kids and they need their grandparents and their uncle and aunts.
wMtB4vixaa	They're also your cousin, just once removed.  So your dad's first cousin is your second cousin and would be a third cousin to your children.|`|BQeG9qeRaa	your second cousin

Its a kid thing.|`|MuVPoAUiaa	Yes, I do|`|34EBzIL6aa	very much so.|`|7uSWKSdNaa	pretty much. if the girl wont even believe her friend over something so petty and childish she isn't a good friend to keep around. A friend should believe you and accept it rather than drag it out making a scene and crying for attention.|`|OL3MUunlaa	not only is it stupid, this girl is extremely insecure and has trust issues.  She's headed for trouble later on if she doesn't address this now.  I feel for her future boyfriends, they are in for a hell of a ride.|`|Uj28Ae8Baa	The only way she'll know is if she asks the boy himself who he likes.|`|JzJ7hAw6aa	Yeah, I would just tell the girl if she's really a friend to trust me.|`|F9mQm1JEaa	YES!|`|2fd99f736d9962101635bd77e69ea12eaa	yup!
uNehLjVDaa	yes he is..we must be married to the same guy! He wakes up grumpy...gives me the shits...its his own problem he needs to work it out.. ask him what he would like you to do to make him happy (and not talking about sex....but you never know that may be the problem....)|`|B12E4rYiaa	It might be time to have a heart to heart talk and let him know how you feel if he don't care then find friends to talk to and do stuff with so you can have some fun and get away for awhile.|`|RtkB46peaa	I love it how you totally run him down and make him look like a lazy, inconsiderate pig, then you throw out a little compliment about him to make yourself feel better.  <br>  <br>  There are names for people who act this way, but I'm not going to list them here.|`|AA11969451	No, my husband is very laid back and generally sweet natured.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I am more of a grump myself|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	Yep, my SO is...|`|5eCYQFU1aa	Yes he is a grouch all the time lately but I know that his job is on the line right now and that he is worried so I try to make excuses for him I guess. I woke up to day being yelled at because I was in his change jar and I told him that I was taking some he thinks its his retirement fund. He is a freak sometimes but then he has to live with me to and my crazy ways I guess my nick name for him is Mr. crabby pants and he smiles when I say that to him because I always tell him when he's being an $?%|`|5oj5YfKMaa	Well, I'm sure my wife would say yeah he is but hear me out. I get up with the kids, she works at 5am, and get them ready for school, I go to work and have the same 45 minute commute as she does. I get home and of course everyone, including her, want my undivided attention and then it repeats day in and day out. She gets 1-2 hours every m-f by herself to relax...me? NOPE....I do my own laundry, take care of vehicle maintenance, take care of house maintenance, pay the bills after I balance the check book, do dishes, cook, clean, you name it while she watches TV programs on the laptop computer....Now I ask you, if you were me and got no time to yourself and felt unappreciated like myself wouldn't you be a little grouchy?|`|L2jIxlGQaa	Yes, I'm married to one for a year now and I'm beginning to think that he is beyond cure. I didn't know he is this grouchy, grumpy and moody until I lived with him 24/7. It could get tiring and by being silent sometimes just doesn't work for me anymore.Her ex-gf told me last week that was the reason she broke up with him.I wished I had the same sense and wasn't blinded by my love to him.|`|AA11715479	Yes, my 16 year old daughter and I avoid him at all costs when he is on the computer. He has this thing that he really thinks that "high-speed" internet really means "light speed". If he has to wait 2 instead of 1 second for a page to load, he swears...also, our mouse is going out and I'm afraid he's going to throw it through the window any day.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	is he just generally bad tempered? my husband isn't ever grouchy, unless he's hungry. then i want to strangle him. other than that he is the most laid back easygoing person i've ever met. <br>  he is super add though. now THAT is annoying. now, now, now, go, go, go. lol.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	funny.  none of the single guys i know are grouchy. coincidence?  i think not.
1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It's not worth another moments thought.  Forget it was even said.  It's over and contact with him should be as well.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Know that he is just 5 years old and his new marriage will fail for he is a failure. <br>  He has not a clue as to what "love" means - only sex. <br>  He HAS to have a woman in his life to AFFIRM who he is as a man and when sex wains - the affirmation stops. People do not have affairs for the sex - they have affiars to find someone to AFFIRM them that they are good, and lovely and lovable. In marriage, we are called to "unveil" outselves to our spouse and in that process we show each other the worst parts of ourselves. If the partners cannot embrace that "ugliness" as part of their mate and instead feel some sort of disgust - they will move on to find a greater beauty in their lives. This is not love. This is utter selfishness and it's usually with the guy. The wife has a child or two and puts on the 20 or 30 pounds and the guy is so conceited in selfish desire for a different beauty, he goes out to find that which he desired in the first place. This is so wrong for the real beauty of a person is not in the physical, but in that inner beauty of courage, contentment, harmony, forgiveness, acceptance, peace and love. This is what people look for in affairs and it really can't come except in the confines of a marriage covenant. <br>  Know that he will be divorced again for he has not changed. He will make the same mistakes with the new wife as he made with you and everthing will fall apart when she recongnizes his utter failure as a man.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	He is married now. He seems to want to keep you around in some way, but that is not fair to you and his wife. It is for his own selfish needs. I think you should move on and not talk to him in for awhile.. Perhaps a few years down the road you can be friends, but for now he is playing with your emotions and you should find someone who really want to be with you.|`|lg6jexk7aa	He is one of those guys that doesn't actually have you and can't be with you - but wants to keep you off the market for everyone else as well (so he is telling you things in hopes that it will spark hope and interest in you for him)|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	"He says he only married his wife to get back at me.

If he really loved you so much why the hell did he break away from you?? Few men love to fantasize other women inspite of being in a relationship and thats exactly what he is doing. And just to get a kick out of it he speaks about all these with you and torments you even more.<br>  <br>  Just let go of him and never try and be in touch with him|`|2aQbutN1aa	thats childish and he needs to grow up. if he really loves you, then he will do what he needs to do to be yours exclusively. if hes not willing to do that, then tell him to kick rocks. youre moving on. good luck|`|5eCYQFU1aa	tell him that's the only way its going to happen is in his dreams  he's a  jerk don't fall for it they never leave there wife or he would have left her by now|`|xNWqqlcYaa	he sounds like a retard.  marrying somebody just to spite somebody else?  i'll bet you end up with him in 6mos.|`|f79tavO3aa	sounds like he wants it all,, wants you to be unhappy,,let him go, your wasting your time and good years

YvvYtsjNaa	Most likely, your problem will end when you realize what love is.  Love is a two-way street.  You're on a one-way street.  Worse, you are going the wrong way on a one-way street.  <br>  <br>  If I may change the metaphor, you are in a very unhealthy relationship.  Continuing with it will only taint your future relationships.  Get out of it quickly before it screws up your ability to enter into and maintain a healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  May the goddess be with you.|`|ivejg4whaa	I've been in a similar situation, it's not going to get any better.

The best thing is to let him go and to find a man who cares about you. There's no point in ruining yourself and your life just for this lazy man. You need to get up and leave while you still can get away from him. He sounds like he isn't supporting you, furthuring you, showing you affection, rather it sounds like he's holdin you back, giving you almost no love, and you need someone better. Don't be afraid, turn away and walk away from this doorway towards the doorway that has limitless possibilities.|`|xZI6noJiaa	He sounds like a bit of a bum to me.

You can only control what you do, and the way things are now, it looks like you are just enabling him to go on being a bum.<br>  (2) If you really want the best for him, then maybe losing you because he won't change will do him some good.<br>  <br>  If things go on as they are now, neither you nor he is going to get what is "best."

DONT NAG THOUGH! guys are so sensitive sometimes and they always think ur nagging them. just be straight up and precise like they are to us and be like, "love u are driving me insane. fu*ckin get a job or this thing we have here is over!"....he will piss and moan at first but he'll realize that he's wrong and ur right. his problem is that he needs SOMETHING to motivate him. that something being U as a GF.....if he's a good person he'll get off his lazy as*. if not, then u dont need him anyway. if he's not willing to make someone he's with happy, then he's an as* anyways and doesnt deserve u.

But depending on the guy, most find confidence; which would definitely show in you admitting your crush, then later asking him out but not straight away. <br>  Same thing happened to me last year, i liked this guy who was in all my classes, and i always caught him looking at me or trying to move closer to me... and i never told him how i really felt. I got over him this year and found out recently that he liked me all along, accept he wasn't sure i felt the same way. So, don't leave it too long because he could like you all along, you don't want to miss out on being with him.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Don't ask him out. Wait for him to ask you. As for the texting, you can text him once in awhile but don't continually bother him unless you have something to text. You will just annoy him otherwise. Smile and be approachable. Please don't tell any of your friends that you like this guy. One will go to him and tell him and then he will be embarrassed and it will be over.
yTirNVXyaa	Do you like working out at home? Or do you do better at working in a group? I personally like to go to the gym and work out... my favorite program right now is Ultimate Body Shaping or Extreme Body Shaping. Basically it is 6 days a week, 3 days cardio kick boxing and 3 days strength training with bands with an eating plan. Its fun you make friends and it's a lifestyle that is easy to live and work with. Try it or something similar out. P90X is a great program but you need to have the discipline to really commit to it because you're doing it at home. If you don't show up to class for a week your bag partner in your kick boxing class will ask why.<br>  <br>  Good job starting now and have fun!|`|YIs51Vp8aa	P90X or the New ChaLEAN Extreme will absolutely help you be in great shape for your wedding.  You are starting early enough that you will surely see the results.  I think you will be happier with the results of one of these 2 programs vs. a class since they are both complete solutions that focus on muscle building to get you lean and shape the body.<br>  <br>  I mention ChaLEAN Extreme because the creator of this has a strong kick boxing base as she is also the inventor and creator of Turbo Jam (Turbo Kick in gyms)<br>  <br>  Both programs alternate cardio and resistance training.  there is even a kick boxing element in each on some of the cardio days.<br>  <br>  I am in my 10th week of ChaLEAN Extreme right now and have had great results.  I am down about 22 pounds and over 18 inches total.  I am stronger and visibly more tone!  It is a great program.<br>  <br>  Hoe that helps and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!|`|ed81acbff795cbe41cd896b5e0a468e1aa	Definitely!  Kick boxing classes are always fun and if you do any kind of an aerobics class, or any type of exercise for that matter, for over a year(with the right eating habits) you will DEFINITELY have him eating right out of your hands...and looking at you very differently, in a good way.  You should definitely find a friend that is willing to do it with you and keep your motivation going.  It's very easy to lose motivation, so finding a friend or personal trainer to help you stay motivated...or just put up a picture of what you don't want to look like in your wedding dress and make copies of it and post them in places that would temp you to lose motivation on not going to exercise or go to aerobics class...i.e; by/on the fridge, in your car, purse, tv, etc...or even better yet, take a camera pic of the photo with your cell phone and save it as your screen saver and every time you open your phone, you will be reminded of what you have to do ;)<br>  <br>  I wish the best for you and I really hope you the best with your marriage.

A girl who thinks and acts for herself, and makes her own choices, that's sexy. That kind of girl presents a challenge to guys that keeps us constantly wanting to find out more.

You need to concentrate on your own abilities and how you can improve yourself.  What type of person do you want to be?  Like someone else or to be yourself.  You need t learn to like yourself and if there is a flaw in your character you don't like then work on improving it.  Why would you hate someone because she is smart and pretty?  We should be happy for others when they succeed.  God made us look the way we do and we have no control over that.  We can dress nice and fix our hair in a becoming way for the contour of our face.  We can control our weight.  But lets face it God made some people beautiful and some people ugly on the outside.  The outside of a person is not what counts, it is what is on the inside of us.  A beautiful person on the outside might be ugly on the inside therefore making her outside not look so pretty.  An ugly person on the outside can have a beautiful inside, meaning she is nice to everyone, helpful, smiles a lot and is just a good person.  When people get to know her they see the inside of her rather than the outside.  Don't be jealous of anyone just be the best you can be and that will be good enough.|`|RqcLxDesaa	I think you need to concentrate on you and not worry about other people. You can't change her, you can only change yourself and to carry malice in your heart is not healthy.

Mahek take that "power" back by relaxing and celebrating your own strengths. Don't try to be like anyone else. Your success is to not COMPETE with anyone. Love and celebrate who you are. if she talks to you fine, if she doesnt  that will be okay.I can tell you if she moved to another school and you never saw her, you would compare yourself to someone else.Start today and be who you are by loving Mahek. Then your confidence will build.

AHZtje9aaa	I am answering this on my husbands page. My name is Patti and I know how you feel. Our daughter who is 7 yrs old now was molested by my Step-Father when we moved to Mississippi in 06. She was 5 1/2 yrs old when it happened to her. She just told us in Oct 08 and my world has been turned upside down since. Honey you need to tell your parents everything. He needs to pay for what he done to you and is step-daughter too. It's not right that someone does that to anyone I mean anyone no matter what the age is. My daughter told us she didn't tell because she was scared of him hurting her and us being mad at her. TRUST ME you need to tell...Your parents need to know the truth. IT"S NOT YOUR FAULT NOR DID YOU DO ANYTHING WRONG. Remember that. You parents can help you and get you the help you need like counseling. It has helped my daughter a lot and it will help you too. If you tell you will feel a lot better about the whole thing and see how much relief you feel for telling. Your uncle doesn't need to come back into your home again to be around you or anyone else he can hurt. I know you're scared I was too when it happened to me but you have to be strong and break the cycle. Please go tell you parents that's the only way they can help you is if they know. I know it's a lot for you to deal with and you feel like no one will believe you. Be strong and let them help you. It will get worse before it's gets better. I'm glad my daughter told me when she did and we where able to help her. Yes it hurt me and yes I cried not because she told me but because someone hurt my sweet baby girl. Us as parents do everything to protect our children at all cost and I'm sure your parents feel the same way.You are in my thoughts and prayers and I know you can get through this. It has made me stronger as a mother,survivor and as a person. I know how you feel it happened to me and my daughter but with the right help and GODS help we have made it so far. I urge you to please tell your parents before you uncle comes. REMEMBER IT"S NOT YOU FAULT YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.......BE STRONG....GOD BLESS|`|a90d2414a4c76a94b6d06ed42bca2891aa	It's your job to tell your parents.<br>  It's their job to do something about it, if they love you, it's their job to protect you, and if you don't say anything he will keep doing it.<br>  <br>  You didn't say how old you are, but if you're smart enough to know what he's doing is wrong, then you're smart enough to know you should take some action -- NOW.<br>  <br>  The hard part here is your parents confronting your Uncle (who is the Brother to one of your parents) Tell them you're scared of him..|`|5Ocb5QiZaa	u must tell them ASAP. It will be difficult for u but also u will feel a sense of relief. But u must put a stop to this, not only for ur sake, but anyone else that he is doing this to. U must be strong and tell them. I am behind u 100%. My heart pours out to u.|`|120fa8a58f89d9395f170c90eb592af1aa	tell the police, OR tell your friend to thell ur parents, and if he does come over alwayz have a bat|`|QdnH6oyMaa	tell your parents... NOW|`|7A30yQf4aa	Please tell them like I should have when similar things happened to me. They are your parents, you should trust them. Tell them, tell them, tell them. They need to know. If you do not tell them guess what your uncle will be over in March. I feel also your parents should have also used a little common sense to ask you why are you breaking down with just the mention of him. Trust me I know it's hard but you will feel better if they know. Maybe instead of feeling overwhelmed with both parents you can tell the one you are closer with and then they will both wanna talk to you.|`|Gac30VHPaa	I am so sorry that has occurred to you. I too was in fact molested when I was younger and I really encourage you to tell your parents about it. My best friend had an uncle, who did inappropriate things to her to, and it was hard to confess after all the years of abuse but I was there to support her because it is not her or your fault for what occurred, IT IS THEIR FAULT. You don't want this to happen to any other of your younger cousins or siblings do you? I really want you to be comfortable and content because everyone deserves to and I’m sure your parents want that for you. So please talk to you parents about it, and they will help you. If not, please do confide in someone else like an adult or very very good friend whom can go through this difficult process with you. Below I have listed some links that might help you and your family. I will pray for you and wish you the strength you will need to overcome this ordeal.|`|mVg9WaLoaa	dear child,<br>  you have not done anythign wrong.  but if you keep quiet about it, tomarrow you will be in trouble again.  any parent who love thier chilren can understand this pain.  just open up.  then you know, instantly the healing with occure in your heart and you will have the strngth and courage to be a bold woman who will say "yes' and 'no' at the right time for the right reasons.<br>  <br>  Take courage and just tell your parents.  i am sure they will stand with you in this.  gud luck.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	you must tell them now and lock your door if they don't believe you|`|lGdzb8aqaa	if you have kept it secret this long and really don't want to say anything I would advise you to get a lock on your bed room door or place a knife in the frame keeping the door from being opened, or  you can wait until he approaches you  and scream very loudly waking the whole house up and tell your parents or just confront him and tell him you remember every thing and you could say that part in front of every one but give him a mean look and no one would think you meant any thing except you remember staying at his house, but let him know if it ever happens again you will call the police your self.at 15 don't be scared you are not so young now or helpless. and I don't think he would try any thing at your age unless he is a fool. but if you could find a way to tell now I would do so, even with the fact he would say it did not happen, please try to tell your parents . good luck to you. and stay safe.|`|xe6wc0jXaa	Absolutely no disrespect to you, but this is a no brainer question. Tell your parents and/or the police. You don't want this guy around. Hes nothing but a dirty bastard.|`|POFdWpUzaa	Think how terrible your parents will  feel if you don't tell them. They will feel they put you in harm's way. Do your parents and you a favor and tell them. Also, do other young girls a favor and tell your parents. Who knows how many young girls he has molested before and after you? If you don't tell them you are enabling him to continue this abuse. It's your responsibility to tell what you know to protect others and to let your parents do what they need to do to protect you. Tell them, sweetie, trust your parents. They love you and want to protect you but can't protect you if they don't know what's gone on in the past. Best wishes.|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	Hi Jaylin<br>  <br>  Im so sorry to hear about this. its a really difficult situation you're in because you're not old enough to do your own thing and you really need your parents on side with you.<br>  Whatever happens, I think you are a really brave young woman for getting through what you went through,a nd I think you're strong enough to make ti through whatever life throws at you.<br>  <br>  I know talking to your parents is probably the most uncomfortable thing you'll have to do, but you need to say something to them.<br>  <br>  Your parents' job is to protect you. If you tell them you are scared they will keep you safe.<br>  <br>  now, if you dont speak to them, (please please please do) theres a few things you can do to get you through this.<br>  1. Ask to put a lock on your door. Tell your parents they can take it off after your uncle leaves. You can just tell them you want more privacy.<br>  2. Never let yourself be left alone with him. If there is three people in the room, and 1 leaves, walk out too. make up any excuse.<br>  3. When you go to the bathroom for a shower, take all your clothes in there and get changed in the bathroom so you are not walking around in a dressing robe or half naked.<br>  4. Tell a friend, or even better, write them or yourself an email before they get there so you have something dated with how you feel.<br>  5. please please please talk to either parents or a teacher at school about this.<br>  <br>  Please email me if you need to talk. I'm in Australia (not that that matters really) victimofya@yahoo.com.au<br>  <br>  good luck, and god bless|`|m0pYcA7Jaa	First off, I'm very sorry that happened to you.  Experiences like that are horrible and should never happen to anyone. Second off, that wretched pedophile should not set foot in your house!<br>  <br>  It's always difficult to tell people (particularly parents) that something horrible like that happened to you.  From my own experience whenever I want to tell my mom something hard, it works to send her an e-mail, or write her a note.  <br>  <br>  This approach may not be the right one for you, but you HAVE to tell your parents about this.  If you are worried about your uncle coming after you, please tell your parents about your concern, it is their job to protect you.  Letting that pedophile come into your house will only give you further trauma and grief.

You're having all these feelings and fantasies for the opposite sex in the middle of your spelling test. And you don't know why...other than the fact that the way he smells makes you crazy. In high school its a little different because the playing field is a little larger. The young guys (your age) are mystified by the hot senior cheerleaders that are fully developed in all the right places. Honey its a hard fact to except but we've all been there...being a freshman is tough. Things will work out. You will be back to having lots of guy friends again soon. Just let some of the newness of high school wear off and allow these guys time to realize that the hotties they like are standing right next to them.

The way you worded your question and details makes you sound conceited and cocky, and if that is true about your personality, then that is probably the reason why no guys are looking your way-because you are raising your head too high up and making yourself unapproachable.|`|88m6Z6opaa	i would have to guess it would be because when they liked you in middle school, you never showed them any feeling's so now word went around that you are very "hard to get" and they wont even try for you. But really dont just limit yourself to only the guys in yur high school. Go out to different places and try your luck with guys from other towns. The guys in your school might just be loserz.|`|RGRNUSGlaa	High school is a different scene...honestly, guys are interested in anything they can get sexual, especially before they reach the age at which they can drive (b/c once they can drive they can work and take girls to restaurants etc. etc.) <br>  <br>  But basically, if you want the guys you gotta "put out" but that can seriously damage one's self esteem and it seems immoral.<br>  <br>  I would simply just get over it and let things roll along for a while. There's no reason to be into guys so much so early. I just graduated and I'm a guy so I'm speakin the truth here. <br>  <br>  Just stay yourself, you'll find a guy...you don't need thousands....haha Have fun and just be the same. Good things come that way.|`|tUDgxv88aa	All the freshmen guys got big heads...they got to HS so they think they have to be cool. They are still just freshies though. Just don't worry about it. You will grow as you go through HS and you will realize that this is just one of those things you go through. By the time you are a senior and graduate you will think nothing of this. Just enjoy HS while its there. Its the only time you get to see your friends everyday. Once you are out, you will wish you were back in. You will promise yourself that you will see your friends everyday or talk everyday...but you get jobs and different friends and sooner or later you will realize that you haven't seen your friends in a while...just don't worry and enjoy HS!|`|UJNxN6uMaa	Eww, I personally don't like Middle Schoolers.

qIM2LtVzaa	Basically you need to just take some "you" time. I was kind of stuck in the same rut, except the husband thing. I just started weight watchers at the begining of this month and its great because it has a plan that is realistic. I have already lost 17 lbs and I am starting to feel great plus weight watchers has support groups and meetings that will help you and give you some one to talk to. Good luck.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I know this is hard, everything really great in life is kind of that way.  The ONLY way you will lose weight is to combine a serious - every day exercise plan with eating healthier food.  Buy a treadmill and find some tv shows you really like to watch so you can be entertained while you go for 1/2 to 1 hour.  Make it fast enough to get a good cario workout and you will release enough endorphins to feel happier and that will also suppress apptetite a bit.  And lastly:  Self control begins and ends at the market.  If you only have healthy foods in the house, you only eat healthy foods.  If you buy cookies/cake icecream, you willl eat it.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Food is the best cure for depression. I won't kill you like drugs or alcohol and everybody thinks its "safe".

Just like when you was at young age , when you was tried to impress the boys . You will find yourself start dressing up and you will find that you aren't look good in those dress , then your mine will start pay attention to what you eat or do ....easy huh ??? It worked for few friends of mine though . Good luck !|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	Just make a goal to lose weight, dont give up so easily.

You can always lose weight, just have to try.|`|1xn7BRi8aa	try  curves...its a womans only gym that you go to for just 30 minutes. the women there are super supportive. i think you will come to look forward to your time there.(and no one judges anyone there). good luck:)|`|Rkik3eUuaa	i gave birth to 3 children and gained a lot of weight after each pregnancy. i also lost it after each pregnancy and now i am 40, have 3 kids and a body which i had when i was 18. which is perfect. my motivation was tv. i hated how they showd all those thin women there. i decided those women were not gods, they were the same as me and if they could remain thin and beautiful so could i. and i must tell u u can achieve anything u put your mind to. and formula is simple - u decide u can do it and just do it. eat less, exercise more. now i can not spend even a day without going to gym. plus i go for brisk 1 hour walks whenever i can. i got used to eating only healthy food, so u give me money i wouldn't eat this filth others call comforting food. when i was overweight each time i wanted to eat smth i started exercising. first it kills time, second it distracts u from thinking about food and as a bonus u lose weight. also brushing teeth at 6 pm helps - if u set as a rule u do not eat anything after brushing teeth. and the most important thing which lots of people forget - water can break a stone by dripping on it day by day by day. u can not exercise once and lose weight immediately. it took u many years to gain it, it will take twice amount of time to lose it. but u must remember . hard working every day puts u closer to your goal of losing weight. and each day u make yourself  exercise and eat less makes u thinner. very little, but thinner. good luck|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	if gaining weight is your concern and your focus then maybe this will help.  try not to go an extra step on food like add cheese, one more bite, small slice of pie, one extra fries...etc...cut down all of that extra step.  Drink 2extra glass of water before every meal, you will probably said that all you eat is water and still gain weight.  i understand depression and stress does mess up our appetite, i just one to mention a couple of choices hopefull one will work for you.  do not eat after 8PM then move it to 7PM after 2weeks.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	i am very sorry for your situation, and your loss.<br>  <br>  not to sound rude but if you're so unhappy with the way you look... try a gym, with a diet, with a weight loss supplement. every time you feel like eating that piece of cake or whatever, or every time you feel like you're just too tired to go to the gym... just look at yourself. i felt like i was trapped inside someone else's body after i had my daughter. i had gained about 30 extra pounds and i am a petite girl so it really showed. i cried and moped around and finally got tired of it and started working out. it's hard the first week or so but once you get into it it's the best feeling ever, and when you don't get your workout you'll feel cranky and just out of wack. it will help pull you out of your depression and elevate your mood. there were times i wanted to give up but i would look at the progress i made and think "why stop now?" i took pictures every week so i could really see the difference. <br>  <br>  it's hard to start, yes. but just DO IT already. once you get past just getting up off that couch you are headed nowhere but up.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Sorry to hear about your situation but yes, I had the problem with stress that brought alot of weight gain as well.  In the morning eat breakfast, such as Special K ( I like the cereal with the strawberries and I get the off brand..it's cheaper). Eat five meals a day. Eat what you want, but limit your intake. No sodas, drink lots of water, and let your last meal be a salad. No eating after 6pm. If you get the munchies then eat something healthy. I would eat a boiled egg, I also like the caramel rice cakes they taste like cracker jacks. Eat yogurt things like that. If you can, try to walk for 20-30 minutes a day. My doctor told me to do this and I lost 11 pounds the first two weeks. It takes determination but you can stick with it. My doctor also put me on Meridia, and I swear by it. It gave me energy and put me in the best of moods. I didn't drag out of bed in the mornings and I felt like I did when I was 20. Good luck..hope it works!

Also, he may be angling to find out info for a friend of his that likes you or he wants to set you up with|`|a268f9d3496f5966f7a0d59105ab21b1aa	I had this once from a girl and just simply told her that i was not the least bit interested in any relationship with her ~~|`|h8LVh29Oaa	Dont resist him any longer.  Give in to your desires.  You know what I mean?|`|r3U8gzvBaa	maybe hes just being friendly
lxLeeYA5aa	Eye contact is very important! Women love it. It assures them that you are talking to THEM, and makes you look much more sincere about what you are saying.|`|s9Pb6MnYaa	it's AMAZING. it works like magic. love potion is not possible, but this is it's realistic substitute.|`|1EoTIZl8aa	As long as she feels comfortable having you even look at her. If she's shy or not, I mean. Normal girls love it!|`|AA10236778	Definitely a respectful thing to do. And it shows you are truly interested in her.|`|eF2OkxMqaa	Yeah, it shows respect and that you're listening to her.|`|zWiU19BWaa	yesyesyesyes!|`|axylPYftaa	well, duh!!<br>  where else would you look, her breasts?|`|Vo4ofYpsaa	definitely it gives the girls a sense of if u like her. trust me thats what girls want-eye contact! good luck|`|wZpHrRDYaa	Making honest deep eye contact is something that is very hard for most people to do.  When you find someone that you can do it with and feel comfortable you've found someone special even if it's never more than friends.|`|GucrpVR5aa	Well when I'm on a date and I'm talking to him, he always looks at me. Because it's polite, and plus would you like it if you were talking to your girlfriend and she was looking at some other person? I doubt that!!|`|I1fQi4Ubaa	YES YES YES YES ! <br>  it is waay better.<br>  trust me when someone looks somewhere else when there talking it bothers the hell outta me. <br>  <br>  i like it when guys just look you in the eye, it's really cute and you act like a gentleman too.|`|BQhNTGQBaa	Yes.<br>  if you dont look at her it'll be kinda rude.<br>  but dont just stare in her eyes. (it gets kinda creepy)<br>  just make eye contact then look at your shoes or the floor<br>  or something.<br>  then look back at her.<br>  hope this helps.|`|NmBjSCOyaa	no. i always look at the floor or her boobs and i get laid all the time, i'm swimmin in trim, i'm a sex master. i'm a sexual dynam. i'm the man. be more like me.|`|XWvUQXrjaa	Yes. It shows her that you respect her & care about what she is saying. She will also know that you are not thinking about someone else.<br>  Thanks for asking! :)|`|3IimJWgXaa	ooo i love when a guy talks to me and looks at me, dont oddly stare but at least try to keep a glance going kinda continuously (: <br>  <br>  good luck!(:|`|XBlokskEaa	Yes, but i know that with me it gets awkward (sometimes the girl looks away and then you look away). But try your best to keep eye contact and smile. :)|`|kuFAx4ymaa	yes.<br>  <br>  if you're looking away alot it shows that you are either nervous or not interested...|`|zQt7y0vhaa	yes it establishes a good connection for communication and lets her know ur listening|`|vg9OYsKFaa	yes of course. if u dont make eye contact itll make the conversation uncomfortable|`|EaCkHmFPaa	YEAH!<br>   girls think its adorable!<br>  when ever the guy i like looks into my eyes i just have too look down so i dont melt!|`|U0skSpGkaa	just be sure to blink!|`|5PcIYh1Zaa	Yes, eye contact to anyone shows respect and confident. Don't stare though...|`|3PrvLMwlaa	rickroll that girl with a clever youtube. rickroll.com|`|8ICDACGaaa	yes make contact. wen guys dont make contact u seem more nervous!!|`|mVg9WaLoaa	it is good to look into her eyes when you talk.  eyes are the windows of heart.  there is nothing that cannot be express with eyes.  look deep into her eyes, now what you see is her heart.  but if you have to see the heart, the look must create a sense of belonging.  <br>  <br>  gud luck|`|IPif5OXCaa	yep!<br>  just dont be creepy about it for example --> O_O<br>  <br>  haha but yea...it shows that you want to really understand her, like looking into her soul. When your talking to her and you look into her eyes it shows her that she is the only one in the room to you. =]|`|1I1tTaxeaa	sure sure|`|b7723f1b74ebe8f069c387e058ea08b7aa	yes its a good gesture and it will tell that you are sincere with her company.|`|GQCDySQLaa	yes yes yes!!<br>  <br>  do not make her<br>  uncomfortable tho;<br>  just enough to <br>  let her know you're <br>  listening to what <br>  she has to say.|`|ca2585b8fcfeb0a5bcda1c6a7dfdca10aa	No, look at her boobs. They speak a mythical language that only our gender can understand.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	If you look away it will seem like you are not interested in them, so look at who you are talking to... eyes are the keys to the soul.|`|F32uPjAraa	Of cause it is. Good eye contact show you are interested in the person you are talking to.|`|22hX0vDNaa	yes definately|`|SSJid9dUaa	yes.. it shows ur interested in the convo.

Throw it out there, just be honest. <br>  <br>  Get yourself all dolled up so you feel very confident, and say "Hey John, do you want to come over for pizza some night?"<br>  <br>  And he'll say "Like a date?!"<br>  <br>  And you say "Sure, I think we can have some fun together..."<br>  <br>  :) Tell him. And, if he doesnt feel that way, be very very cool and calm. Cry later at home. :)|`|3QAml5oPaa	Just go and tell him like, hey do u wanna come out 4 a date or somethin?<br>  <br>  if he says yes, then congratulations!!!<br>  <br>  if he says no, then say:hey dude, why do u look so worked up? i was just kidding around!!!!u get it? kid? kidding around?

8II1frHiaa	There are more personalities in this world like your best friend.  you can't do anything.  She shows her inability towards you.  you better keep silent and you need do anything. it is difficult to explain her and to tell the truth because, she is the person affected.  she will realize her mistake one day.  so, as i said early, please be silent.  she herself will come to you and then you can explain her.  you invited her to your cousin's birth day party.  it is also her mistake to leave the place while you are at toilet even to say for courtesy sake.  so, she is doing more mistakes.  Better to keep silent until she realizes her mistakes is my opinion.
znxFD103aa	If he really feels bad, he will never let it happen again. If he ever does it again, dont think twice leave him immediately. I am a believer in giving a person a second chance, but anything after that you are risking your own integrity, and in this case safety. Dont let yourself become a victim of violence. Despite what anyone says, or how you may feel, you are completely in control of your future, and only you can choose the type of man you want in your life. Good luck.|`|IsRk5ZoVaa	wow.! are yu serious.?<br>  damn its not worth it;<br>  what if you guys get in another fight what do yu think he'll do next.<br>  i think you want too trust him, but its hard after your boyfriend slaps you, you dont know what too think.<br>  i think you should go with your instinct and juss tell him how you feel about him slapping you.<br>  well the best advice i can give you is too do whats best for you and if its even worth it.|`|djLDZXoZaa	cwu is right!  you dont need that,  your better than that and need to leave him now.|`|0C8lOe6Faa	that is awful and disrespectful you should leave him|`|A94u2In8aa	I know your boyfriend seems to regret it but i really dont think you should trust him.This is how it begins.With the little slaps jabs and next thing you know your lying on the ground all bruised n beaten.Im sure you dont wanna break up with him but stay on your guard and warn him that if it happens again your out.Whatever you do don't just stand there and take it okay?If he genuinely feels bad then it probably wont happen again but still...its better to be safe right?|`|FMKJ5Ejvaa	would you trust that he probably bottles stuff up inside.. then has outbursts? it's probably the beginning of an abusive relationship.. take some self defense classes after you dump his ***!|`|7QDYWAkfaa	honey get out of that relationship! This is how it begins.  If violence is his reaction to a fight it'll only happen more!|`|ivdpHmaxaa	chris brown and rihana?|`|oxA65YkYaa	ownt|`|yMwhxpVuaa	wow!!!|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	hah its funny how every0ne just skips to DITCH HIM<br>  <br>  well maybe he really didnt mean that<br>  <br>  My boyfriend gets mad and slaps me at times<br>  but i hit him too<br>  lol<br>  <br>  well i dont really mind:S<br>  for some reason<br>  <br>  Cuz at times i am wrong<br>  (I smoked..)<br>  ahha<br>  aniwaiz<br>  <br>  Stay wid him<br>  but if it happens again<br>  den you have some thinking to do|`|707gOCvbaa	Only you can decide if you are willing to trust him.

PD1fZV7Aaa	I married my High School Sweetheart and we've been married for 20 years now. We have four kids and are still in love. We have had our share of hard times. Any marriage no matter what age you get married at will have periods of struggles. A lot of times after being married for awhile the marriage goes threw a stale period. When a couple see's this happening it's important to act on it and regain the "FIRE OF ROMANCE" all over. Date one another and flirt with one another. Usually it's Kids that interrupt the closeness of a couple because one or the other spouse allows the kids to always come first. Anyway a marriage can make it no matter the age you get married at. BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO BE WILLING TO WORK AT IT. Just know that it will not be easy sailing.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Well I married my high school sweet heart and to tell you the truth we learned what being in love really is after we got married. Also we were able to get married so young is because we are financially set, trust me you wanna make sure you can afford everything before getting married or else you'll just end up fighting over money...Marriage is hard and it's a lifetime commitment. It's not only about love either, you gotta make sure that you got trust and communication down or else the relationship won't last long. Just make sure that you guys know the difference from loving someone and actually being in love...|`|C59bTKO2aa	I've known quite a few people that married their high school sweethearts.  And there were quite a few that never made it to their first anniversary.  High school love is great, dating and hanging out, talking and making out.  Then there's married love. You work and so does he, you come home tired and so does he,  you fix dinner, clean up the kitchen, put a load of clothes in the washer, take the load out of the dryer and fold it and put it away.  He's in the driveway, trying to figure out why your car keeps dying when you stop at a light.  You iron your outfit and his shirt for work tomorrow, you made a lunch for both of you.  He comes in and takes a shower leaving the tub with a residue of grease from the car.  You clean the bathroom, put the washer load into the dryer and throw his grimy clothes in the hamper.  You both sit down to watch TV, you both fall asleep in the chair.  Hours later you wake up with a crick in your neck, your mouth tastes awful.  You go brush your teeth, wash your face, set the alarm and sit down on the bed to take your shoes off, you lie back on the bed for a minute to rest, in just a minute you will go get him out of that chair in the living room.  The next thing you know the alarm goes off.  You get up and start the coffee, you sit down and write a check for the car payment, car insurance and light bill.  Repeat X 1825.  Hey, it's been 5 years, you are starting to get the hang of it now!|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	Less than 5%. People change as they get older.. It might just be the thrill of being in love at the moment, that being said, some people marry their high school sweethearts and are still happy.|`|d0fLx0LPaa	I married my high school sweetheart and we've been married for a year now. However, I got pregnant at 17 and we got married while in high school. We had talked about getting married before we found out I was pregnant but we'd also known each other for 5 years and dated for over 2 and were set to graduate in a few months. So I knew he would stand by me through my pregnancy. It hasn't been easy, but we had trust and friendship before anything else, and it takes a long time to establish that. So you may think he's the one but time will tell. Also keep in mind that the divorce rate for high school couples who get married is VERY high.|`|qSBwKqsxaa	Well I have mixed feelings about this. It is true, that sometimes high school sweethearts get married (My aunt is married to her hs sweetheart). But the girl I love is with her high school sweetheart right now and I hope they break up, cause we're childhood sweethearts and belong together. lol If you love him and he treats you good then there is a good chance that you guys will get married.|`|dD1WAPREaa	My parents were high school sweethearts, and they've been happily married for a very long time. However, it is very easy to say "we are really in love and I know this for sure" when you're in high school. <br>  <br>  Don't be in a hurry; that's my best advice to you.|`|nN4ldjcBaa	It is rare but it happens. Thought I would marry mine but it ended up going  nowhere. HS is really too young to decide who you will spend your life with.|`|zQt7y0vhaa	well it all depends on you two. ive been with my high school sweet heart for 3 years now but who knows what the future holds.|`|4Mb1mFORaa	6.<br>  <br>  what kind of question is that. that's something google knows, not humans. idiot.|`|zhsTxqGxaa	It's happened before but it's extremely rare.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	9mos?  and youre what maybe 16?  and you have your life planned out huh.   yeah, by all means get married.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	It happens.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	i married my high-school sweetheart, after we had been apart for 8 years.
SohrsIBoaa	im guessing you guys are young? because he doesnt know he has a mustache...and for the kissing. i do the same thing, i hold my breath. until i feel like im gonna pass out, then i breathe really hard and my girlfriend hates it. but its funny. i do it on purpose. with the lips... you both kinda just do your own thing and hope it works. its hard to teach someone how to kiss without really kissing them and thats probably a little weird in some situations.. good luck and remember to breath! ps, just tell him to shave. my girl tells me to shave all the time because it hurts her face, i dont care though. doesnt hurt my feelings.. or my face =)|`|p6Pv6ioOaa	Kissing stubble always hurts.  Tell him to shave it or grow it, because it's digging into your skin.|`|P1YeBCnaaa	tell him to shave in a positive way, believe it or not most guys like compliments from their girl friends...  you can tell him he looks sexier and younger without a mustache.... or he turns you on more with out it... just a positive comment for him to shave it....|`|2d09327ea4cd614cbb7db85428b4dd5eaa	Well, first of all. I love facial hair!!! But if it really bothers you you can say to him, "Hey, I think you'd look so cute without a moustache" and maybe he'll get the idea.|`|zGthY1Jeaa	he doesnt know he has one?? omg, i swear these ppl r getting dumber by the second.|`|rgwNRg3xaa	He has 1 but doesnt know it? how does that work? is it peach fuzz?

vn2Lq7hIaa	You may not trust him yet but you sure do love him. I don't know of any woman that would put up with that kind of behavior from their husband.<br>  <br>  He may be having a "hard" time getting it up at home. ( bells are ringing) cause he's getting it somewhere else, probably daily on breaks or time out tasks that require two people. He only kissed her ? YA RIGHT. I swallow glass too.   <br>  <br>  As for the Viagra in the glove box that's sort of a man thing it's like having some condoms, and a tube of K.Y. there too. I keep important<br>  things like that in my vehicles. You just never know when you will get<br>  to put another notch in the steering wheel. But I'm single so there is a BIG difference there. Even so I wouldn't mention it til you notice it's gone, then as WHERE IS IT?<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|SsfnitjXaa	Take the bottle from his car and don't say a word.  <br>  <br>  I would put a GPS tracking device on his car.|`|RtkB46peaa	You don't?|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Viagra or no Viagra, if he's texting a woman he sees every day at work, there's a problem.  You need to stop searching for clues and start talking to him.|`|onbwN4csaa	While your at it check his wallet for condoms. <br>  You sneak you.<br>  What and were else  do you search.<br>  If I thought I was not trusted. but was .<br>  I would make her right. <br>  Just to piss her off.|`|ZGertwvdaa	Trust is broken, sounds like its over. lol.|`|LlRAOMq8aa	I think in one way or another you are trying to hide sins by saying ur husband just kissed ,thats cheating for heavens sake,en it seems h has been taking the viagra for the other woman anyway you need to confront him and know what is going on .|`|fnQM26BMaa	You already know the answer to this question.  You are simply delaying the truth.<br>  <br>  You asked this question looking for some sort of comfort...when really...all your going to get is rude, inconsiderate answers.<br>  <br>  Ask him about it, see what happens.|`|gYIdZ8Xuaa	simple solution get him to take the viagra take him upstairs and make him forget about her.|`|G8VNBSj7aa	The viagra is for having sex with the other woman !<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry for that, If you are smart you wouldn't spend your life for a man who cheated on you !|`|I71ePk4Haa	Your getting cheated on girl...this isn't so much about viagra, but that he has the hots for another woman...one he works with no less!! Where there is smoke...there is usually a fire.|`|C93lTJozaa	Tell him your glad he got them and you will now know if they work  I would watch him But they may be from his past I hope it works out for you|`|ZtfN4J6taa	"Only kissed her" !   And you believe that ?  If you did, then I have some oceanfront property in Arizona i'd like to sell to you !|`|WzDMqxYyaa	Only kissed her...well I wouldnt be trusting that.|`|lg6jexk7aa	I wouldn't be as concerned with the viagra as I would be about the fact that your husband didn't tell you that he was having erection problems.  Plus on top of that - hooking up with his co-worker, what the hell was he thinking?<br>  <br>  Is he going through a mid-life crisis or something?|`|CVfV1AHjaa	I'm not trying to rune your marriage but i would say spy on him, and if you catch him with that woman again, threaten to divorce him. Im he still is with that other woman than divorce him.|`|u4lmvH7vaa	Well were any missing from the pack?  I have some experience in this and go with your instincts! Unfortunately, I don't buy he has ended it if he has the drugs in the car and sees her everyday...|`|Yq3a6UAXaa	you don't need to live your life like that. you'll always have the thought of him cheating again in the back of your mind. you would be better off alone than stressed. i say kick him to the curb!!|`|8hEmS9qeaa	I would not worry,,,but I would also be calling a divorce lawyer.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	wow, i wish my wife was as gullible as you.  of course i'm much more careful about cheating on my wife than your husband is.|`|J2bnw5EZaa	Seems like he has a low self-esteem based on the fact that he can't get it up and probably has a hard time satisfying you.|`|GEO762SZaa	DONT TRUST IT, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRYING IT OUT WITH YOU, NOT HIDING IT|`|5eCYQFU1aa	show him to the door, what if he gets a std? and gives it to you.gross

UOj60V3uaa	Im not an expert at this but I do have experience in this. When he says there is so much more..... he is expecting you to agree so that you can start a conversation about that summer and your fling. then he would break down and tell you that he had feelings for you. This is just a way for him to show you he cares without intruding, expecially if you don't want thim too!|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	the "so much more, but i don't know what to say" is meaning he might want you to say something.. so he can say everything else he wants to.. and or he wants to get to together so you both can talk :]<br>  <br>  i think you should talk to him<br>  <br>  he is definately meaning something more than just a friendly... "you mean a lot to me!" otherwise he wouldn't have said "but i don't know what to say"<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck ;D

I'd suggest either enjoy your hyperness while it lasts, or perhaps try to see a counselor or therapist (maybe a psychiatrist) to see if you can get help for your hyperness problem.  You may have a chemical embalance that's making you act like this like my friend did, or perhaps some other disorder that causes excitement around people.  I'd suggest at least trying to see a counselor at your school and if they aren't able to help, try asking your parents if they can send you to a therapist.  If the thereapist can't help you, he'll refer you to a psychiatrist who will possibly give you meds to help you.|`|x3RGtco8aa	when you find yourself acting crazy just say to yourself "look at how your acting and how other might think of you for behaving like this"
1Rmm0DADaa	Ok here is what I think.  You and him were casually dating.  Which mean if anything you two were either in friend zone, or friends with benefits.  And unless you both were being honest about whether or not you were into one another, Spring break is not gonna help.  If he wanted to be with you, regardless if you haven't called, he would pursue you.  But just to be fair, and because I am all about woman being equal to men in making moves first, why don't you call him and ask him point blank if you and him can continue whatever it is you two were having.  Not only will it put him int he position to be real about it, it will give you a chance to move on and find someone new before break.  Always be honest and clear about intentions from the start that way you won't have to worry about the gray area and gaps that leave you questioning if it's a red or green light.  Hope this helps, but if it don't work out, the good thing about Spring Break is that you will find someone new.  Always!!!!|`|s25JpCwkaa	Depends.  Did you let him "Tap" already?  Was he extremely nice at first and now he doesnt even text you? If he is really attractive he might of figured you were too much of a hassle to wrestle with your self respect and moved on to easier bait.  Does he seem like the studious type? If so he's probably into his studies.|`|Im0iKFjmaa	Honestly- he probably doesnt like you that much. Try to hang out with him- see if you guys can hang out and fix things a little bit, but if it doesnt go anywhere, move on. Its dangerous to get hung up on one guy. Also, make him be straight with you. It sounds like he's being really shifty with you. Ask him point blank if he's interested in you. Honesty is always best.|`|thXFB45Waa	There are alot of confused guys out there . they never know what they want. I say that if he doesnt ask you that means he's hanging out with another girl. Because if he really cared he would have asked you along time ago. maybe even as a rebound.. i know by experiencee girl.|`|sasDYyTZaa	i agree with the other answers.<br>  you should bring it up. go after what you want. if you wait any longer you might lose.|`|ztc3SKKjaa	men these days dont really like to make the first move anymore.  i think that he is waiting on you, to see where ya mind at; so, just ask him what's that deal?  it wont hurt....good luck|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	Youve lost touch, thats all. Just gain momentum again and suggest something to do...|`|bAnyRNZUaa	As a female, you are lucky b/c you can almost always take guys at face value of what they say or do.  If he is not showing any interest in getting together, he has moved on.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think that since it was pretty casual that you guys have just kind of parted ways in a sense. You guys weren't hanging out as often and he might of just thought you didn't care to hang out anymore.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Why are you dating a kid?|`|GsRpZJX5aa	he doesnt seem that into you anymore. so if i were you i would just move on.|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	jus bring it up...if you really want something sometimes you hafta go after it on your own

AA10065812	Okay, I had to read your question history to understand the question.  I was beginning to wonder if this was a more interesting relationship.  Apparently his ex-wife and child was residing with you for a while, and no, the filing should stand as Legal.  Show your husband the following:<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>
PBdPD748aa	oh. my. god.<br>  <br>  it is BEAUTIFUL!! i absolutely love how elegant, glamorous and classy it is - all at the same time. <br>  <br>  i have a maggie dress also, her designs are fabulous, the quality is the best and they are all very slimming!!<br>  <br>  edit: jewellery IS a personal thing, so if it were me, i wouldnt wear a necklace, simply because there is already some sort of design up the top chest area and it could look too much, i would go for swarovski crystal earrings and a bracelet. That is all. Very simple, i wouldnt go anything thick or chunky either. the dress is so stunning and is far from plain so i wouldnt let jewellery take away from that beautiful design.|`|hMavMBo4aa	It is pretty.  The first dress I had (they sent me the wrong size and then it was discountinued...but dont worry about me i got a new one that i loved even more :)...anyways the first one i had was like that on the bottom.  When I brougth it back it was hanging on the rack and I overheard people talking about how the bubbly part of the skirt looked back.  Anyways...you won't notice the weight on your wedding day.  I didn't even notice my shoes that had hurt my feet after 1 hour at my fittings.  I like wearing hair down with strapless gowns- curled, of course.  Then minimal jewelry; I can't really see the detail of the dress, but it looks busy.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	I don't know....honestly? I think it's too trendy, and the weight of it seems really unpleasant. But that's me. Some women can handle a really heavy gown, but I was happy that mine was fairly light-I was able to dance the night away without feeling dragged down. <br>  <br>  But if you really like it, then I would go with a sassy birdcage-because the pickups add a LOT of gravity to the gown, which will make your body look really narrow, but, will force the eyes to naturally look downward. If you want guests to be brought back up to your face (and you do!!), you'll want something up there that's dynamic-and a birdcage veil would do that-it would provide visual balance from the crown of your head to the bottom of that train. <br>  As for the necklace, same thing: the gown is really fancy on the bottom, but as a whole the bodice/waist of the gown are really plain-so you'll want something sparkly, either as a necklace or a killer pair of chandelier earrings. Something to make the eye shoot back up to your face. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, there are many other maggie's that are way more timeless...but, it's your dress. If it's The One...you'll know. And none of us will change your mind.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	I LOVE IT!!! lol... its very elegant and stylish... since it is heave i would go low w/ the jewlry... like a pearl necklace and pearl earrings would look nice i think... Good Luck! U'll look gr8 in this!|`|LAXbJfvwaa	It is ok - not my style - but that doesn't matter since I wouldn't be wearing it!  The only thing that would worry me is that you say it is very heavy - and it is a strapless dress.  That means the boning will dig into your hips all day.  But if you can put up with that then why not go for it?<br>  <br>  As far as jewellery and veil - I would try to keep it simple so the lace on the dress stands out and isn't overshadowed by anything else.  Have a look at the what the pics in the maggie brides testimonials look like.|`|j1k8qGd6aa	It's a beautiful dress. Purchase it if that's what you love and want to wear it's up to no one else. Wear very simple jewelery since the dress isn't simple.|`|epyTmcOdaa	Its wonderful you must wear a simple jewelery because your wedding dress is completed & in that way the dress will be seen better.Congratulation.good luck|`|qfUjyUDTaa	Lovely dress but one for a woman who's in good shape!....Im bigger through my tummy, hips and A** - it would not look good on me!! <br>  <br>  Its lovely though - hope you look stunning in it! :-)|`|thY5nTVlaa	I REALLY like it. The lace is a bit much... <br>  but otherwise you might have some competition for that dress...|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	It's too body-tight for my taste but if you like it, go for it!|`|BXd4I9mmaa	love it|`|xQGCf8GGaa	its great<br>  u wear diamond nekles<br>  and earrings which hand|`|vyL7yEleaa	not something i personally would have picked but i'm a traditionalist. <br>  <br>  your not gonna know until you try it on if it is the dress.. but maggie sottero is a very good dress maker. i have one of her's that i am trying to sell (my first wedding dress that i never got to wear and now dosen't fit)|`|aGzvt9ohaa	I just bought the Maggie "Reese" dress.  The pick up skirts are very popular.  It is a very elegant dress, I suggest finding a store near you where they sell Maggie's and trying it on.  I actually got lucky and found a trunk show, and got mine discounted.  I often look at what the model is wearing for help with hair and jewlery.  Good luck to you!!|`|VPCVswkpaa	OMG its beautiful depend on ur budget i would go with diamonds but not really flashy ones jus because the dress is so pretty you wouldnt want to take away from that or even silver or white gold would be pretty. I wouldnt go with a veil unless u just absolutely have to be traditional. Congrats|`|dpk9n2SSaa	This dress is just gorgeous! I love it. Try it on and if it looks good on you, get it! Best wishes on your wedding.|`|QCwIueTfaa	i like it but it okay for a wedding date but see you should make your dress because you can have it the way you want it that what I'm doing but it your wedding dress you pick...|`|pbY8Y44maa	Its nice! I love Maggie dresses, the one I'm wearing is from her as well! I would say just go with something elegant, simple, tasteful as far as jewelry but it depends on your style and taste too! Good luck!|`|YzhZCs3Naa	absolutely radiant!|`|425zh5IXaa	IT IS SOOOOOOOOO AWESOME I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|fByUiSJ7aa	its adorable hunny!!!! Good Luck and maggie is my fav site!!!!!!|`|3SSVBJAqaa	The skirt is dated. You may regret the decision when you look at the photos a decade from now, if it is very heavy, you may regret not being able to move during your reception, or dance comfortably with your husband, but, if that is what you like, go for it.<br>  <br>  Birdcage veil<br>  Simple pearl jewelry. Anything more, or real glittery, will be too much.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	typicly i dont like dresses that dont turn into a skirt till that far down, but i LOOOOVE that one.  the skirt is so pretty, and it flows better than similar dresses i have seen<br>  <br>  wedding dresses in general are heavy.  i went in to a bridal store expecting prom dress weight dresses (i was a fan of the poofy prom dresses, lol) hoooo was i wrong. every one i tried, even the slimmer fit ones were heavy.  its just the quality of the material they use.
MuSYw7m3aa	yep, and its probably never going to get easier. Its horrible hows guys and so inconsiderate about girls when every little thing they do around us(or at least me) has some kind of meaning thats always wrong. And then when you finaly think YES he likes me you just get turned around for dissapointment because they either dont like you or if they acutally do they move on in about 2 seconds so it was a waste of time and you still love them or have feelings for them. Unreqiuted love that guys dont realize or care about.. It''s sickening and depressing but us women just keep on feeling those emotions and feeling sad for the guy who has moved on so long ago. And even if there is a slight possiblity he might still like you(and there usually is that slim possiblity) then you cant get over the just because your unsure even though everything that you might tell from how hes acting if completely just firnedly and nothing specail.  and even with this informaiton we keep on feeding the fire, and keep on coming back to them and its horrible and then when your finally almost over them they say something that might have some meaning behingd it and then you go crazy thinking about the meaning of it. Yea, i know it sucks, and it will probably never end. I wihs you the best of luck :D|`|JEnGz5I4aa	i hate love in a way it hurts and everyone gets there heart broken sometime and it is very confusing but then one day you meet the right person and it all gets better sure you still fight but you make up because you love and respect each other.<br>  MFL!|`|Jqmyxmboaa	Exactly how i feel. <br>  Agghh it's so frustrating sometimes...
D3hYbsVJaa	Stick with that church, they can be a great support. Also, try ot get in a small group there if they have one, and find people you can trust to lean on and be spiritually accountable with. They will no doubt know a lot of resources.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	how about a book on common sense which would have saved you in the first place.  I am willing to bet there were signs and red flags that you should have saw probably even before you got married and early on in the marriage.|`|8hEmS9qeaa	Just remember you married a cheating loser...it is not your fault. You picked the wrong person, find someone else who will love you. Maybe join a church group
T3b4I4kXaa	Unfortunately, it is very common that the new "spouse" trumps the ex and all kids in the household... and often creates enmity. The mom or dad falls for it because they so badly want the companionship of a mate, and tend to be open to manipulation by this new "spouse"... at least until the manipulation becomes crystal clear in a way that cannot be denied.  <br>  Your dad is only thinking with what's in his pants. His now woman is successfully deploying the "divide and conquer" stratagem to separate him from his family and get him (and his assets) all to herself. About the only thing you could possibly do to stop this would be if a private investigator turned up some real dirt on this harpy... like a string of "black widow" marriages, or an arrest record of some con schemes.<br>  <br>  You are an adult now, so you need to face those facts and move on... release the anger and hurt. Quit transferring that hurt to other people by snapping at them. <br>  Move in with your mom if you can so you can save some money.<br>  See if you can cure the transportation problem by working two part-time jobs during the breaks and summer. <br>  Move on and make yourself proud of how you have overcome adversity.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	your jealousy has been clouding your judgment right from the start.  try being happy for him instead of being so nasty.  <br>  <br>  you tried to pull a power play and you lost.  that should tell you something... stop being so selfish and act your age.|`|9bz6EpoLaa	your dad is SICK and needs serious help. who in their right mind pushes their child away for a partner???!!!!  try writing him a letter or e-mail and pour ur heart out in it. tell him everything u feel and how its affecting your life! if that doesnt help, leave him alone. he's become not worthy of your time n effort. GOOD LUCK!|`|kU0pC50Uaa	OMG im totally in the same boat as you are <br>  im a major daddies girl too and my dad got this new GF and urg its all about her and not about me, it got so bad that i left california and moved to Oregon with my brother. ANywho, your dad is always going to believe his new Gf or wife or whatever because he is in love and doesnt want to do anything to ruin that realtionship and she must have a nice tight hold on your dad too. its gunna be like a war between you two to see  who can get his attention and love and so far by the sounds of it she is so winning. This isnt the first time it has happened to me but my last stepmom that was like your dads ne gf oh man i got her back so bad. i always talked to my dad about the negative things about her like how lay she got when he left what she did or what she said or what she ate. i found out the qualities my dad didnt like about women and made her look like the worst woman in the world with all her nasty habits, so soon he became unnattracted to her. Like i said its a battle now and if you really do want your dads love back you have to fight for it and your gunna have to get creative. and your snappyness is not a bad thing your pissed and you have every reason to be but take it out on ur dads new girl hehehe and do an evil laugh to make it better muahahaha jk.
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	A) your still pressuring him<br>  <br>  B) hes a guy, and since you gave him an ulitimatum, he is going to do the typical guy thing and wait and  see if you actually do live up to your words<br>  <br>  C)well, i cant think of a c actually, but at the rate your going and the fact that you keep pressuring him doesnt add up|`|54be3c7eda2a6643c24f8ad882a635d7aa	It doesn't sound like it.|`|I7sS4w0maa	IMO NO because you are BOTH playing games and you are giving him ultimatums which are going to push him away|`|PBdPD748aa	I completely agree with MYTH_UNDERSTOOD<br>  <br>  you really need to back off, its not going to be an enjoyable thing him asking you to marry you when you have been hacking at him constantly before that.<br>  <br>  seriously, take time to NOT talk about it, you have told him 6 months, it is close so let it be. you cannot control this, as much as you want to you cant, its not healthy.<br>  <br>  he knows what he is doing, perhaps he is planning it and wants you to shut up for a little while so he can do it without having you putting the pressure, cos none of you will be happy if thats how it will have to be.<br>  <br>  trust me, dont mention it. not at all. even if he mentions it. it will get to him more you being sad and quiet about it, cos he is so used to you raving on. reverse psychology works a charm!! mark my words|`|cGbTJobeaa	If he wanted to marry you, you would have the ring already.  He has the benefits of being "like married" without giving you the respect, security and title of wife.  He's not the marrying type.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't man up after the 6 month ultimatum period, then cut your losses, move out, lick your wounds and move out.<br>  <br>  I suspect that giving him an ultimatum will be about as successful as getting pregnant was in terms of getting him to marry you.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Why .. seriously ... why should he marry you when you're already giving him all the benefits of marriage, without the resonsiblilty?<br>  <br>  If you TRULY are not waiting around forever, what in the world have you been doing for the past five years of your life ? That IS forever ! To leave now would be utterly pointless, and it would also break up the home when you have a baby who doesn't deserve to live thru that. Do not punish your child by leaving now.<br>  <br>  Look: You made the choice to live with him instead of saying, "I"m not living with anyone unless it's marriage, darling," so you can't complain that he hasn't committed. YOU made that happen, not him. YOU are the one who's been giving mixed signals, saying "ok we can just live together" but then you decided you wanted to get married. You're both guilty of mixed signals. Now, the fact that you have your signal straight is a good thing. He knows that you want to get married, and he does bring it up ... like you said, which is also a good thing, so maybe you need to just CHILL for a little while.<br>  <br>  I have an idea and I sincerely hope that you will follow it: STOP with the marriage talk. Don't bring it up for 30 days - I dare you. Could YOU live with someone who constantly brought up the same subject all the time? <br>  <br>  PLEASE, I'm begging you ... stop talking about it! <br>  <br>  For a month.<br>  <br>  Give the guy a break, ok?<br>  <br>  P.S. to Scott: It's not just a piece of paper. It means that a final committment is being made. It means that they are legally bound to each other. They are each responsible for the other, and there's no "I can just walk if things get tough" anymore. You make promises, you say vows,  and you take a huge leap of faith that it really CAN work. <br>  <br>  Piece of paper? <br>  <br>  Uhh ... no.  Not really, no.|`|6jZcr33paa	Leave him. If you let him go and he comes back wanting marriage then he loves you. If he doesn't come back then no,he was never serious about marriage. I left my fiance after 5 years of reasons why he wasn't ready and our daughter was 4, 2 months later he showed up at my door with a ring.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Go with your word. Be patient and wait until the end of the 6th month and then you will know what to do.|`|r5CttpsFaa	maybe|`|0cfwrcx5aa	sounds like he doesnt want marriage, but wants to stay with you.  obviously, your relationship is more important than a word to him.<br>  <br>  but with you, it sounds like the only thing that matters is the ring on your finger.   you pressure him, so he does something to appease you.<br>  <br>  then you give him an ultimatum?   sounds to me like marriage would be a horrible idea.   <br>  <br>  if you guys can live together, and have a relationship, what does it really matter if you are married?   you can buy a house, and live together, and love together, and work together, without a peice of paper.<br>  <br>  i dunno, i get a lot of red flags from both of your actions, and it doesnt sound like your relationship is going to last.  but then, im just a guy on the internet, and ive only heard one little peice to your story, so, who knows?|`|1fa8H0m8aa	I think you should move out of the house and go with your parents.  Until he's ready to take the relationship serious, you will have to take action.  I hate to say it, but This is why its not a good idea to have baby's out of wedlock..that means without being married.  So don't bring up the M word again.  You have to do what you have to do.  Just like he is.  Put yourself and your baby first.  It's your choice.  Or just don't bring it up again and suck it up.  Good luck to you!|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Guys like this annoy me,  They want all the benefits of marriage, but they don't want the license.<br>  <br>  I'm willing to be that if you two were to elope, he'd do it in a heartbeat, but I'm guessing that he doesn't like the idea of spending a bunch of money on a wedding and having to host a reception.<br>  <br>  It's one more reason that women shouldn't move in with a guy until the date has been set.<br>  <br>  He'll marry you when he's ready.  It's the last thing in his life that he has control of and giving it up is tantamount to being neutered.  I understand why you are upset, but he doesn't and never will.  Most women jump at the chance at moving in with some guy and they go ahead and start families without being married, but then they change course and want the wedding band on their finger.  It has to be confusing to the average carefree male.|`|XTfr3uKQaa	That's odd that he's been with you for 5 years and is still afraid to get married. Whatever you do, don't get married to him if you feel at all like he's only doing it to please you. You have to see the change in him, and let him decide, and let him be the one to really want it. Or else it's not worth it and he's not ready and you don't want to marry some one who's not ready yet. <br>  I dunno, if you really really love him and you think he really really loves you stay with him and see what happens ....but if you have doubts i would say move on...|`|xkB4AiuAaa	If you honestly loved him you would wait and not give him ultimatums. I think that him wanting to buy a house first is a practical idea, somewhere for his family to live is probably the higher priority.<br>  <br>  Telling him you will leave him if he doesn't marry you? I honestly find that rediculous!  If you want to marry him , you want to be with him forever, but if he is not willing to get married your going to leave him? Are you in this for the love or the pretty ring that you may or may not get?|`|bdb470d10970e14b0c42c27d3ebaa544aa	I say give him some time. Maybe he is saving up money and/or convincing himself. Either way he should want to do it not feel pressured or obligated to. You have given him a safe haven from marriage in your relationship and threatening him will not help you any. Just relax men mature with time and if its meant to be it will. Good luck to you!|`|L5ie6msYaa	dont do that r u stupid, ur pressuring him. take it slow. u've told him alot of times. most guys are afraid of marriage and in your relationship thas good cause he wants tom make sure you are both ready, so that you can live a happy marrige. dont pressure him. he will when he is ready|`|qjQbIxsMaa	He's just not that into you.|`|2awmeoXJaa	yes|`|A8YUlTimaa	no|`|zgZLpvRoaa	no|`|2d09327ea4cd614cbb7db85428b4dd5eaa	Jesus Christo. ummmm... why don't you just wait. Trust me before you know it, you'll be married. What's the rush anyhow?|`|97039615344ac5178ef9d9363f443b35aa	The short answer: no.<br>  <br>  I learned the hard way that if a guy wants to marry you, you will know it. I wasted 15 years on a man who enjoyed all the benefits of marriage without the ring, and when the smoke cleared, all that was left was my broken heart and a string of affairs (all his). And yes I did the ultimatum thing, and yes he did the talking-about-marriage thing, but he stalled and stalled, and in the end, he just did not want it (LOL, until I left - too little, too late and that's a whole other story).<br>  <br>  I eventually met the man of my dreams, who would become my fiance - he wanted to marry me after six months!  Take it from me, there is a man out there for you; please don't pin your hopes on this one.|`|Hfp80ylEaa	When you give a guy an ultimatum like that, be ready for the deadline to come and go.  For most men, when you make a demand like that with a time limit we are already looking for a way out.   Now, keep in mind just because he didn't bail outright doesn't mean anything.   If the time limit passes and you don't follow through with your threat, we know we have the power and control in the relationship.   We see it as an act of desperation but since you didn't leave as threatened that you'll stick around as long as we want.   When that happens, good luck ever getting what you want.  He'll know right when you throw down the gauntlet that he isn't going to marry you and he'll leave you the minute he has someone else lined up.
slNm7BZ4aa	hahaha<br>  i don't have any, but i wanna hear some people's stories too! lol :D|`|cRqCyIdRaa	not me.

qWwUxhFkaa	Your friends should respect ur opinon no matter what. (if they're your friends) and if the reason for them not being friends is really stupid than u should tell them to grow up and not start acting like little kidz! (unless their reason was serious... obviously) and when Penny moves, don't abandon her becuz she will feel neglected and u may not have the chance to talk face-to-face. On the other hand, Jill may feel distant becuz u may be trying to get ahold of Penny, when she moves away.

You silly homo. <br>  OK, you think I'm a retard. Sure. If I was retarded I couldn't even type these sentences correctly. I also don't post something on the internet whenever I wanna have sex.

Seriously, you're pathetic.|`|p9X6fX3naa	Don't tell him you got your heat, let him come over still and then tell him you want him.|`|Vkv0Ba1faa	You're fre@ky|`|kxmp3M58aa	YUM i want some of that NOW|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	You don't want to look like a whore?

We did not work out but we did indeed enjoy the sex.  So, lets discuss a mature freindship where benefits are an option.  Lets discuss not only the fun stuff, but also, the boundaries, ( and create whatever boundaries you want).  If this sounds like something you feel you are mature enough to handle, lets do it. If not, I understand."  <br>  <br>  That way, if he doesnt do it, hes not rejecting you. Hes saying that hes not mature enough.  A good boundary is always to include Safe sex, or monogomous Freak buddies, and to also discuss jealousy issues in case one of you may get possessive.  <br>  <br>  Finally, how do you get him there?  He already thinks he going to fix the car heater.  When he gets there, tell him its fixed and have your mature adult conversation.  <br>  <br>  If you dont start such a conversation now, when will you? I know women in their 40s that are still playing such childish games and I will tell you now, us good men want a woman that is confident, smart communicative and honest.  Cowardly, lying, insecure stupid women come a dime a dozen.  ITS YOUR CHOICE!|`|pi5WKPNwaa	If you really want him, reject him. Or make it look like you are. If you tell him your heat is fixed so you don't need him to come over. Then you can say if you want to hang it is cool but no big deal.  He will want you more if he thinks you don't wait him.  On the other hand if he knows you want him he will use it for his advantage.|`|Jp6nKWQQaa	Well...<br>  Do you want a relationship or Just Sex...<br>  <br>  I mean...<br>  No Offense but,<br>  I Wouldn't just get with an Ex for some pleasure time, I like the whole "Relationship" Kind of thing. haha.<br>  If you want him back in a relationship, then dude, just ask him.<br>  Just say things relating to you wanting to be with him, you think of him, and then maybe afterward.. You'll get "Fre@ky". hahaha.<br>  But if it;s just sex,<br>  See if he's interested,<br>  then go for it girly.<br>  Just be careful ok?|`|uNazz3HLaa	Why not compliment whatever it was he was wearing the last time you saw him? Say how well it fit him, and no one could wear it like him because of his "fill-in-the-blank". Men respond as well to compliments as we do. Actually, come to think of it, I'd say better than we do. Their egos love a good stroking as well as other parts of them.|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	he's your ex?   I'm probably not going to get a "best answer" for saying this, but let the guy go... and realize that what you have isn't love at all, it's superficial lust which at some point will always end in heartbreak.|`|MDkEiaTFaa	Well if it is your ex then perhaps it is best for you to not get involved with that person again. believe me there are other fish in the sea.|`|VPkKvbRDaa	First off,don't use your ex for sex.<br>  There's a reason he's not your boyfriend he's your "ex".<br>  He might not want it you just cant force him anyway.<br>  Cry a river,build a bridge and get over it.|`|nTU3YxRXaa	hey bro just tell him that you guys shouldve never seperated and that when you were only happy when you two were getting freaky. if hes anything like a normal guy he will take any chance he can to get laid hopefully i helped bra.|`|EcI03UPUaa	put on something sexy under your coat!

It is him being your best friend, never fighting no matter what, him knowing when he needs to hold you, always doing all you can to make one another smile... and most important always being 100% honest and true.  I should add being together 24/7 could never be enough time together... on our time off together we are never apart.  Thanks... I never stopped believing.|`|hg167NM0aa	Yes because I am in love.

iblT1HJpaa	You now know the definition of "selfish" and this is the start. You will only see this get worse through your marriage. He will demand his way in everything. Vacations, money, kids, discipline, chores......everything! <br>  Time to stop the insanity for your own well being. <br>  If he's not willing to stop the demands  - get out now for you will only see it get worse.

Maybe he is afraid of intimancy or getting you pregnant.|`|AA11391968	I assume from your question that you were having intercourse prior to marriage.  Is it possible that he is hiding something from you, like an std issue?  I think you should sit down with him and talk about this.  Explain to him how you feel and what you want.

And there is nothing wrong with being gay.  However it is cruel to marry someone and "pretend" you are straight.  <br>  <br>  Here is the ugly reality.  In terms of sensation, and equipment, there is little to no difference between receiving oral sex from a man or a woman.  So if he doesn't like intercourse, and only likes oral and even that not so much, he is gay.|`|X7i59NeIaa	I think you could get this marriage annulled and I would. Your husband is sick.
RtkB46peaa	If he has changed, something else in his life has also changed.  It is extremely rare for someone to change their personalities so drastically on a whim.  <br>  <br>  The standard American marriage comes with standard problems.  His change in attitude is nothing terribly unusual, and it's cause is often related to your actions and inactions, not simply him being a jerk for fun.<br>  <br>  You say you're an emotional person?  How about this.  Use those emotions of yours to put yourself in his shoes.  See things from his perspective, and make sure you're thinking like a man when you do it.  Woman logic doesn't apply to men.  And visa versa.<br>  <br>  Oh, and guess what, he has emotions too, he just doesn't cry when he's feeling bad.  As a matter of fact, I'd venture a guess that when he's upset or feeling bad, he actively hides it from you.   And probably for good reason.  You're not a bad person, but just like he doesn't understand you, you don't understand him.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Or you could stop not working on your marriage and grow with him instead of apart. Just a thought.|`|99eCtW9baa	maybe he's seeing someone else. maybe he's mad because your the old model and he's trying to upgrade to a newer model. i can't be certain, but it sounds like cheating to me.  try taking a vacation instead of a break, (probably tough with the economy the way it is) but breaks usually don't work. once you break something its hard to fix without getting new parts to place it back together.  i don't know where i was  going with that but i hope it helps|`|xNWqqlcYaa	yeah, he's definitely banging someone else.  you see what it is, is that your dumb ideas and emotional outbreaks are eating away at him each and everyday and one of these days he's just gonna snap and put you throug a wall.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Ah, such is the nature of men and women! <br>  John Grey had is right  -  "Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars." We are two different creatures and only when we can embrace that difference and accept each other for the unique qualities that each brings to the table can "love" continue. You are not "emotional" - you are a WOMAN! And as a man, he sees emoting as a sign of weakness. And this is why guys don't show emotion. Why do you think that women like "chick flicks"? Because they show women the continuing nature of what they desire in relationship. I always joked with my wife about going to see a chick flick - "How many 'splosions does it have?" <br>  This is it right here. Guys are into battle and warfare, destruction and action - not EMOTIONS! <br>  You are not wrong in your attitudes. Your husband is and he's not alone. Most men do not understand this emotion thing until they have had children to care for - especially little girls. <br>  The birds came home to roost and it's now time to finally look at the woman who is his wife from new eyes. Most men are still little boys and it takes 10+ years after high school to realize who they really are. This is why young marriages rarely work out. <br>  How can you get him back? <br>  First - he has to come to understand WHO he really is before he came even cross that bridge to find your essence. <br>  Get "Wild at Heart" by John Eldredge and read it together. <br>  Then get "Love and Respect" by Emerson Eggerichs and read it together. If you want - get "Captivating" by Stasi Eldredge and see where the real woman lies hidden. <br>  And then keep it up for the rest of your lives. There are only 10,000 million books out there that have all the information of the world. <br>  p.s. - Ask your husband to factor an algebraic function or explain Pascal's Wager.

A94u2In8aa	The only way to do it is to not do it.I mean theres no nicotine patch for porn addiction you know.When you get one of your 'urges' try and distract youself with something else..nothing visual..how about listening to some music or reading a book?You could even go for a walk with your wife..or talk to her to distract yourself.I was gonna suggest you have sex with your wife more but i dunno if that'll help...|`|AA10504387	Bad habits are hard to break.  We all have them.  <br>  Rubber band bracelet.<br>  Symbolically associate the reason why you want to give up the addiction --all the positive things that happen when you give it up.<br>  Connection, happiness, reality, your wife's smile, her pleasure, your true pleasure, etc.  <br>  Associate those things with the rubber band.  Symbolically the rubber band is these things.<br>  Then, use the rubber band to remind you when you reach for the fix of porn.<br>  Wear the band on your wrist and snap it when you need to remind yourself.<br>  This is not about punishment - but more a mantra to remind yourself of as you wean yourself away from this crutch.<br>  You could use something else - maybe a necklace or bracelet.<br>  <br>  Also, give yourself two weeks at least to change the habit, and seven years for the urge to completely go away.<br>  Every seven years our bodies are completely remade, every cell is replaced.|`|mMBzpldbaa	porn is a normal device which visually-minded men use to masturbate. and if you only do it every few months, then you do not have an addiction. porn is not cheating in any way, shape or form. if you could genuinely not stop yourself looking at it several times a day, then you would have an addiction. <br>  <br>  as it stands, it just seems to me that you are simply repressing a normal desire, so it is seeming bigger to you in your mind.<br>  <br>  if you and your wife are so prudish about something so normal and widespread, then there is something wrong with you.|`|YUkwTD2gaa	delete all the porn on your computer and ask your wife to check your computer everyday to show that there isn't anything that could upset her.<br>  i'm glad that you're trying to pull through for your wife, this dedication will probably be seen by her and i'm sure you both will pull through.|`|HdmRtF71aa	watch gay porn or beastiality, and if that turns you on then damn theres is no stoppin your porn addiction,,|`|vh9i9IsIaa	Whenever you feel urge just leave your desk and go for a walk.<br>  Take a lond walk like 5 miles. It may help.<br>  Good Luck|`|F8J5TVQGaa	talk to your wife about pron and how she understands it. tell her how you feel when you watch porn and that its not to hurt her or demean her. just basically talk to her! its your wife!|`|ZZThs5mXaa	I don't see any harm in you watching porn, But I guess it makes your wife feel less special with you watching other women. I guess she would like to be the one you fantasize about sexually rather then porn stars when your having sex. Although looking at it the other way round, Would you rather know your wife was fantasizing about you or a porn star? <br>  <br>  Women can lose self-esteem quickly and can be tured off ver quickly also. Ask yourself why just watchng it with her isn't enough and talk to her about it. <br>  <br>  Next time you get the urge, Try suggesting acting out a porno with your wife, Having her write you a dirty story, Share sexual fantasies or spicing up your sex life to feel more sexually ful-filled. <br>  <br>  It's probably going to take time, But considering you haven't watched in 3-4 months now, Shows you are trying and that's a good sign. Good Luck!
xe6wc0jXaa	If you want to read them, ask him. If he says no deal with it. Don't do it behind his back, nothing worse than a deceitful woman. If you think hes cheating on you then leave him.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	How about, don't. Everyone has a right to privacy, even boyfriends.|`|lWobDwmnaa	you shouldn't do that. respect your privacy. how would you feel if he read all your text message and accuse you of cheating on him?<br>  <br>  <br>  exactly.|`|bXF1gDTcaa	not that i condone that cuz i think you should be more respectful and trustful of him or you two shouldnt be in the relationship, but you can open the texts and most phones when you go to the menu you can select mark as unread and it'll make it like they were never read.
vg9OYsKFaa	when a girl says NO that means NO. dont be worried though because just because she doesnt want to have sex right now she is only 16 and you are too. i said a lot of stuff when i was 16 that i thought i meant until i got older lol. give her time. shell come around trust me. unless shes like super religious.|`|GmghrL4Iaa	No. It means she's not ready.|`|bkcMkGLaaa	Man, she's 16.. you're 16.. What's the rush?  <br>  <br>  Here's the thing, when girls are that young they are still tryin to figure out life.  They've just been exposed to the world, and have a lot of things going on in their lives.  At 16, you're not yet an adult, but not a kid anymore either.. Unless she plans on becoming a nun, she's going to have sex.  That's just a fact of life.  But man, what she's tellin' you is this: She's not ready yet.  Believe me, for us guys, it's not really a big step.. It's more like a right of passage, an entry into adulthood so to speak.. but for women, unless the woman is an absolute slut, sex is something that means more than you can ever imagine.  If you want to go and break a girls heart, then keep pushing her, but if you really respect her, then let it lie.  It'll come, eventually - and if it don't, well, you'll get there soon enough.. Just relax and enjoy the ride.|`|x62wDqmRaa	She means she ain't having sex with you, pal.|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	I just dont think she's ready for it yet. Be patient and dont push her.|`|27IeVZNeaa	ehhh it sounds like a yes and no|`|QbOYIixuaa	She's young and afraid. I never though I would have sex. I got drunk and had sex, sure. As for sober sex, I never thought I could do it. I've been with my man for 6 years. We are getting married next month and sober/drunk sex is great. Your girl is young, scared and has little experience to back her feelings up. Don't press the subject. If your a kinky horn dog, you might want to find a new girl. If you all about the sex, you'll never find the "right one."|`|3ox4lYu6aa	I'm sure she will changer her mind. When I was about that age I said the same thing. I told my boyfriend I never wanted to have sex. I was just scared. But now that I'm older I changed my mind. Have you ever asked her why she doesn't want to have sex? If you haven't then that might be a good idea to find out exactly why she doesn't want to. Like I said the reason I said it was because I was scared maybe she is too.|`|LOdkuFZ7aa	Differs between girls a lot. She might not be ready, or she might just never want to.<br>  <br>  Try slowly progressing towards her lower body if you want to have sex with her. Lightly brush her vaginal area through her pants if you're under her shirt, and eventually get more intimate until maybe she might have sex with you.|`|thXFB45Waa	She isn't ready. But when the time is right for both of you guys its better. Besides i promise you its going to be  worth the wait.<br>  Dont push her away she might get distant from you.<br>  Girls dont like when guys do that.|`|UWx1beYtaa	Maybe she thinks your trying to push her and so she's saying that? No one can be sure if she will never have sex in her life. You may just have to prove to her your not in the relationship for one thing,.|`|2DDVJSp7aa	Wow, that's a big thing to say..<br>  She seems pretty physically immature to me bud. <br>  Don't expect sex anytime soon... In fact you'll probably never get it during your relationship. :p|`|7KZ84uYKaa	she doesn't want to have sex right now, maybe later but even if she never wants to if u love her then you'll stay with her thats what u really want to know isnt it?|`|j8ue6qIeaa	Gosh some people on here are so rude! I don't think she is ready to do that with anyone at this point in her life. She's still young and still needs alot of time to think about what she wants for herself in the future.  I'm sure she really cares about you and all but I just think she doesn't want that kind of realtionship right now. Does that make sense? Maybe she thinks that your only going to want her for sex or that its going to be an all the time thing or who knows. The only reason I say that is because I'm a girl and Im telling you from a girls point of view. She may NOT feel this way so you need to find out and just straight up ask her. Also commitment scares some girls. You guys have been together for a year but maybe she thinks that by having sex she needs to be with you forever. So many possibilities so you need to talk to her about this. When i was younger I always said I was never going to have children, but as more and more years go by. I get closer to actually wanting one  Hope I helped|`|sasDYyTZaa	i think if she was willing to get all physical with you then there will be a sex life between you guys but you should just be patient. she may have a bad experience that makes her think this way. eventually the teenage hormones will kick in. just make sure you make her feel safe in your arms.|`|tUDgxv88aa	She's 16...people still influence her a lot...like her parent's and teachers and if she goes to church...that too. Just don't be too hasty and maybe she will get over it. I give her props for waiting at least...most girls won't these days. Just keep it in your pants for a while and see where it goes.|`|OGKq67YAaa	Uhhhm... well i aint no expert but...<br>  Just go with the flow and yh<br>  Hope it works...<br>  She might in the end <br>  Lol
AA10096832	Of course you are worried. You're a mom of a little baby. That is totally normal. Anytime my newborn wasn't near me, you can bet I was worried!<br>  <br>  That said, your ex sounds like a decent person that you trust. Someone who wants to be a good dad and involved with his son's life. If he has to change baby's clothes 6 times a day because he can't put on a diaper correctly, believe me, he'll learn! For little things like that, you have to learn to let go and let Dad learn his own way and develop his confidence.<br>  <br>  I would balk at overnights until your baby is much older. At least 2 but preferably 3. It's really hard for babies to be away from their moms so if there's any way to avoid it, I really would do so. He can do the sleep at dad's for the weekend thing when he's older. Next best thing would be to demand certain sleeping arrangements. If baby is going to sleep over, he needs a CRIB and he needs to be either in dad's bedroom or a bedroom nearby.<br>  <br>  I think I'm hearing that you're pissed that Grandma is going to get all of this time with your baby when she didn't even show up until the last minute. Well, I understand that but unfortunately there's nothing you can do. When I got mad at my MIL suddenly popping up out of nowhere and demanding babytime, a friend said "She loves baby, too. And that will mean there are more people in baby's life to love her. Which is a GOOD thing." Hard to hear but still, makes sense. Hope this is useful to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck. This is a difficult thing but I'm glad you are trying to work out what will be best for your son.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, lots of dads do the plop baby next to them while they watch TV thing. I've know devoted dads who did this for the first months/year of baby's life! While it's not great, it's not the end of the world. I think dads do this because they have no idea how to interact with a little baby, to be honest. Keep nudging dad to be interactive with baby but recognize that he's not the only one who takes this route. And you're not the only mom to say "Hey! Read the kid a book, for heaven's sake!". :)|`|SsfnitjXaa	Trust the father with keep his son safe. <br>  <br>  When the child is in his care he will be allowed to do things his way just as when the child is in your care you will do things your way.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter when his family "came into the picture".<br>  <br>  The child will not be forever in diapers and he will learn to do all those things.<br>  <br>  The more you allow the child to go over there, the less "stressed" he will be,<br>  <br>  Do you not realize that this child belongs to the dad as much as he belongs to you?|`|xNWqqlcYaa	it was smart of you to get knocked up by somebody you were so compatible with.

8II1frHiaa	ok.  it is until treating a friend as a friend only.  Friendship is good but it is always better to keep a friend as a friend and keep distance for certain issues and matters.  you should not share all your secrets with friends and it may give bad effects if you happen to feel difference of opinion on any time.  A right good friend is a friend to whom you should always keep distance and continue the friendship alone. ok?|`|OZAxA6J5aa	say again??
a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	It works about 100% better than being easy.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	It might work with desperate or not-too-bright men. When a woman plays hard to get, I move on to someone that shows some interest in reciprocating my attention. I won't waste my time on someone that does not encourage me. We used to call them "Pr*ck Te*sers". Who needs them.|`|Sj4vrnXXaa	Personally...i think its a waste of time.<br>  <br>  Lemme explain: there are 3 types of guys<br>  <br>  1: the "good with girls" type...who don't waste their time on hard to get girls...so its a waste of time for the girl<br>  <br>  2: the "regular guy" type...every regular guy type is different. Some may go for the hard to get girl...other may not, just depends on what they want....so it could be a waste of time for that girl<br>  <br>  3: the "awkward guy" type...well if he is awkward around girls, and the girl is playing hard to get, he will just think that the girl doesn't like him. so it is a waste of time for the girl<br>  <br>  thus, with this i hope you see why i think it is a waste of time|`|HKkbqlIuaa	From experience and observation, it can work about 50% of the time. However, if you really want a guy, are you willing to chance it? From what I've seen, whenever a girl is trying to play hard to get, it doesn't really work. Whenever they genuinely aren't interested in the guy, they come running. Lol, I know it kind of sounds stupid, but I don't think it's worth it. I think that if you like a guy, you should go for it.|`|wyUhx5b6aa	Yes it does. I did it 20+ years ago. I made him chase me; in fact I made him track me down and ask ppl for my phone number because even though I excepted his number I wouldn't give him mine. I know times are different now w/ all the technology but just because a guy asks you for your number doesn't mean you have to give to him....it's very nice watching someone fall in love with you.<br>  FYI: We are married w/2 kids.......|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	haha in my opinion, i don't have much time for that..i'll put up with it for a litte, then after that if she's still playing hard to get, I'm done.<br>  <br>  Not a big fan of wasting time and looking desperate. :)
ozBkHxuHaa	You shouldn't feel guilt for someone a year younger than you! Think of your ages, and then add ten years. Doesn't seem so big then does it? In fact, my best relationship was with a younger man. Unfortunately, we didn't end on great terms, and in doing so I lost my best friend. Be careful. If your too worried about losing the friendship, don't do it, but there is always a chance to fall in love, and that, is worth the risk. Good luck|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Beccy, the year difference between you is nothing. My first wife used to say that she raised me to suit her. <br>  <br>  Dating a guy does not mean that you are in a relationship. You are just dating-going places together, spending time together, learning to know one another. At some point, you and he will decide to go on seeing each other or not. In the meantime you both are doing comparison shopping, so to speak. Is this the person that I wish to have a relationship with for a while, or is it a waste of my time because I don't enjoy it.<br>  <br>  His inexperience? Inexperience at what-going to the movies, dancing, talking, eating popcorn with a pretty gal? Don't make something out of nothing. He may be shy, but with some minor encouragement, he will be fine. This is something that you can do for him, and it will help you also. <br>  <br>  Fifty texts a day is a lot, in my  book. I would not text anyone fifty times a day, and I have a lot to say. But, if you enjoy that sort of thing, then let him. I just hope that he does not burn himself out. <br>  <br>  Whorish? Don't have sex with him. You are not ready to become a mother are you? You are not sure whether to have a relationship with  this guy, so why have sex with him? You don't want to marry him right away, so no sex, so no baby, so just date him. Sex is NOT a given on a date, is it? IS IT????<br>  <br>  Beccy, just enjoy his company for a while and see how things are. If you are not pleased with his company, just tell him so, and do not find fault. It is a question of taste and no one is to blame, and part friends. You do not have to explain any further than that. Period. To anyone, including your friends. EVER!<br>  <br>  I wish you well.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|HdmRtF71aa	yes, dont create drama that doesnt exist  with your best frieds relationship that has nothin to do with you
3O1EcmrGaa	Can't you figure out that you're being used?|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Learn from the experience. How does this make you feel? Make a decision. Who is really the girl on the side? It could really be you. Think about it.<br>  <br>  Determine if the relationship is casually intimate. If he is only a sexual object with no intellectual future or merit, practice safe sex and enjoy. <br>  <br>  If you have other expectations, it is time to discover the joys of independence. Guys are not mandatory.<br>  <br>  Focus on career, education, and personal goals. Build a circle of academic, athletic, and extra curricular peers with similar intellectual interests. The mutual encouragement and enrichment will facilitate the benefits of generic friendship.<br>  <br>  Success expands the frontier of career and personal prospects. <br>  <br>  Immature and premature pairings are an unnecessary distraction from the priorities of education. Romantic intimacy is something better experienced when maturity presents adult responsibilities. <br>  <br>  Until then enjoy the social evolution of generic friendships and peers. Eliminate the confusion and drama. <br>  <br>  Become the center of your own universe.|`|5nkcIfKXaa	You are being used.  <br>  <br>  Let this whole mess go.  You deserve better.|`|ozBkHxuHaa	Wait a minute. He's sleeping with the both of you? What makes you think that he isn't sleeping with a third person? Honestly my foot.

HKkbqlIuaa	I can understand why you'd be jealous; I probably would have reacted the same way. "I love you" isn't always sexual or romantic, but I know that if any of my guy friends were in a relationship, I wouldn't send them messages like just out of respect. If you really have a problem with it, talk to him about it. I think that although she probably didn't mean any harm, it's a little inappropriate for someone to send something like that. For instance, all these people who are saying you're overreacting probably wouldn't feel the same way if you guys had been married. I think you should talk to him about it.|`|SohrsIBoaa	no you didnt over react... from a guys point of view this is how i feell..... there is a special bond between you and your man. and you both have obligations in a relationship to stay faithful to one another. he has to understand that there are lines that you dont cross. and that in my book is crossing a line. i know that if a guy gave a kiss and said i love you to my girl on facebook. hes askin for a fist to the face. thats how i see it though, thats borderline cheating to some people.. he needs to make a decision, you or the other girl. give him the ultimatum between you two. tell him you dont mind if they are friends there just has to be line he doesnt cross. you let him get too close to her hes bound to hurt you weather it be by cheating or leaving you for her.. your choice, thats just my point of view. good luck!|`|DP3rQkrtaa	don't worry. If he loves you he will stay faithful to you.|`|tM35loy4aa	OMG that kinda happen to me too. Well instead its the reverse I have a female friend and she just told me she got her first kiss. I felt overracting like now she found someone I believe she is going to forget about me.  Then later I felt sad and feel isolated because she's my only friend that been with me for five years. The good thing is she just had a first kiss but just wanted to be friend with that guy. I told her about it and she said you'll find someone believe me you'll find one.|`|PzHplogSaa	You have the right to be jealous and its natural. Talk to your bf regarding this matter. Be open about your feelings to him. Let him understand where your feelings coming from. Be yourself. Be happy.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Saying you love someone doesn't mean sexual or romantic; it could just be the way you love your family and friends.  Unless you have a good reason to think they're sleeping together, you're overreacting.|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	wow she is in love with him and he's scared to lose you until he knows it will work with them..how common is this!!!|`|AA11584265	No you didn't over-react. Its natural to be jealous. I don't care who it is...if they say they don't get jealous...then they are lying. Everyone gets jealous about something at least once in their life. Next time, tell your boyfriend how you feel when he talks to her and that may be a way he can understand your resentment toward his friend. Keep the lines of communication open that's the best thing.|`|GsRpZJX5aa	uhhh no i'd be pissed off <br>  stupid girl talking your man<br>  talk to him about it and be aggressive<br>  <br>  be be aggressive     haha<br>  <br>  no seriously make sure he doesnt have any you know feelings<br>  about this girl. man i hate girls like that. who know he has a gf but wont stay away.

If that's the case then there should be no problem. As to your question, NO, you didnt over reacted. you did the normal thing. you got jealous. if your boy doesnt love you, he wont bother saying stuff to you to make you come back in his arms. dont worry aright? Sort things out for awhile then (this you should do), PREPARE FOR THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN. Its just a precaution. Im not saying that he's cheating on you. well, goodluck though.|`|rDUmQKniaa	If you trust your boyfriend you'll be fine, if not I'd find a new one.

Straighten out to her that he is Your boyfriend. Then see what happens. youll never know until you ask.

If you assure you will be really home sick, bring some pictures of your parents and a note book you can record.  You can write in it on how you feel at that moment. When you get home after the camping trip, you can read of what you wrote, and smile. I want you have a lot fun and be careful. God bless.|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	Sarah you'll be fine. I get homesick real easy and I'm 28, but I find after a few days away I actually start enjoying where I am and then usually don't want to come back (I get away-sick then! lol)<br>  <br>  Just remember, there's a big world out there filled with a lot of exciting things that you just can't see or experience form home.<br>  <br>  Be bold, be brave and you'll be fine!|`|aTmvjG7vaa	Just try to think about other things, keep yourself busy the whole time<br>  And if that doesn't work, come up with a list of things that you will be glad to be away from home for, like doing chores or having to make your bed, etc. <br>  Just try to have fun, and don't start feeling sorry for yourself, It is hard not to do, but really you are going on the trip to have fun, so plan to have fun, don't plan to cry and be homesick the whole time.|`|Gac30VHPaa	I used to get homesick while I traveled alot on study programs that were out of state. It is natural I think to feel that way sometimes, especially when you are in a new environment. You need to relax and remember that you will eventually be home soon enough. Do not allow your homesickness to take away from your new experiences in the world. I have no doubt soon you would learn to grow up a bit more and be excited every time you are experiencing something new. In the meantime do more activities and make plenty of friends. Keep your mind focused on the present location you are at and soak it all in.|`|5lXouSKAaa	If youre truly that homesick when it comes to traveling, then dont go.<br>  <br>  Its only for 3days so have fun, live life to the fullest.

And yes feelings do "go away" with time. u dig?|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	That means that she still likes the guy but not as much as she did a while ago! It happens and people just need to face the facts. Maybe he should talk to her and ask her flirty things and stuff so that she knows that she will have a chance with him and that he really likes her back! ~I LOVE Derek|`|GQCDySQLaa	i dont understand the first part,<br>  <br>  but yeah, over time i suppose <br>  everyone gets over people they<br>  'like' , specialy if nothing happened|`|awFM6viqaa	well i know i have told a guy i really liked him and meant it after a breakup. But over the course of weeks, i grew to not like him as much so i just "liked" him. Since the girl you speak of hasn't seen u in 4-5 months maybe some of the chemistry has gone out. But i doubt she dislikes you now since you guys had strong feelings for one another.|`|PzHplogSaa	For me if I have strong feelings for someone, it does not go away easily. Hard for me to let go of the feelings although I set free the guy the feeling is still there but I have to learn how to let go of that feeling as much as I can.|`|AA11179568	she likes you in first impression<br>  but maybe your attitude or something you did turned her off which declines her likeness<br>  <br>  or maybe you're not making any moves to date her etc<br>  that makes her think you're not interested and so she would find a new man<br>  <br>  btw im not a girl just answering<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226220944AADuMzR">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|SfHnBaBYaa	I think something would still be there.

But maybe after she sees him the old feelings will come back over time. <br>  <br>  When a girl has strong feeling for someone it can stay with her for quite some time. It may go away quite a bit but I think at least part of the memory will still be with her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|h8bJHOuSaa	if she falls hard enough then it takes a long time for her to get fully over him to the point where she would say no<br>  but most likely she liked him for a reason and that reason probably didnt go away in the last 4-5 months<br>  it took me two years to get over a guy and we never were anything else than just friends|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	UHMMMM NOPE!

wDq3vkQ2aa	I am not sure how old you are so i wll say this... if you are living in her house you respect her as best you can but you do not have to listen to her words. I would leave the room or walk away when the abuse starts and i do mean abuse it is emotional abuse. You are being a good servant of the lord in doing things for her, but also enabling her to keep hurting you. If it was not your mother and just a friend you would have ended this friendship i am sure. She sounds like she is not a mother you should bend over backwards for. you can respect her and protect your emotional well being at the same time. cook her dinner eat and leave. You are in control of how many times she says hurtful things to her. And she may not know any other way of being with you. Also tell her she is hurting her although this may not have a positive effect and she may not change at least you will have the satisfaction that you told her how you feel.|`|bvbcNwWNaa	omg this happens to me too. my mother makes these rly bad remarks about me. she complains about everything i do and how i look and the clothes i wear. she tells me that im fat and i should lose weight wen everyone else doesnt think so and she aint exactly skinny mini either. im ever so nice to her but someday i mite crack and yell. their either doing it because they could have a similar situation done to them wen they were young or their just insecure about themselves. dnt worry u will b fine. this happens to a lot of ppl and ur not alone :)|`|JYTSF21Haa	what causes anyone to hurt another is because of their own personal sense of self hate,that may not show, no self respect, or unresolved bitterness and hurt from their own that had nothing to do with the person they are hurting.  or menopause or hormone problems.  we hurt the ones we love the most, because we know the ones that love us the most, unconditionally love us.  it is sad, that we are taken advantage of and used as a venting ground for their stuff.  perhaps you could have a heart to heart with you mom, and let her know you are hurt.  sometimes how people feel about themselves really, is what they lash onto others.  have seen it so much.   seems to me that something is getting taken out on you, and it is not fair to you.  it is not wrong to take care and nurture yourself, my friend.  even if she is your mother, could you step back, and not do so much for her?  give her some space to become more appreciative of you.  love, richie louise|`|wMtB4vixaa	They do it because they can and they don't really think about how bad you could really be if you let yourself go buck wild.<br>  <br>  One day you'll put your foot down and mean it and after a little time of not speaking, you two will get it together.  And she'll respect you for it.  "Putting your foot down" does not have to involve cursing or disrespect of any kind, either.
d3WiJVk6aa	"Use" you bf for child support?  No.  If you are not married to or living with the father of your child, you need to have court-ordered child support established asap, period.  Buying things for the baby and "taking care of" the baby doesn't count, those things are in addition to financial support.  I'm not sure where you are, but in my state the law requires both parents to provide financial support equivalent to what the child would benefit from if s/he were living with both parents.  Child support is based on the income of the parent that does not have primary possession of the child.  No one can "use" your bf for child support, that money is what he is legally responsible for providing to his child.<br>  <br>  If you're living at home with your mother, and she is helping you while you're getting on your feet, and you have not even started the process for establishing child support, what are you doing?  It is time to step back and look at your situation.  Your child's needs need to be put above your relationship with either your mother or the baby's father, and your relationship with your own mother should be a higher priority than your relationship with your boyfriend.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Did she get child support from your dad (I am assuming your mom was an unwed mother or a divorcee).  <br>  <br>  She is doing it because it is a legal way to get money out of a person and make a man pay.  She is not worried about morals or ethics.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	if you are 17 he should be paying you something weekly, if you are older he still should be paying support or you should move in with him, since she is doing every thing to prevent you from living with him, I assume you are not yet 18,and she has a legal right to expect him to help provide extra things for your baby, him visiting, buying diapers and wipes and a out fit here and there is not supporting his child, so you need to think about what she is saying and be reasonable. and it does not mean she does not love you or the baby..babies are expensive.|`|0fofwDG5aa	Your mother wants what is best for u and her grandchild. She probably knows if u have child support set up in writing there wont be any shock to u or your child if something(& I'm not saying it will) happen to him & he leaves or whatever. I'm not being negative here, I wish u all the best I'm just a realist...because I've lived it!!!!!  <br>  Then again maybe just talk to your mom & tell her how u feel & that u need her to back off!!!
JYcvCMjaaa	You should ask her again because since she's so happy about her and her boyfriend breaking up and stuff, I think she's hinting to you that she wants you to ask her out. So you should just do it, and if she says no I doubt it would ruin your friendship because you guys stayed friends after the first time you asked her out.<br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|LtFPFcuyaa	Hi there, they say that love beats all and personally I believe the greatest route to discover it is on the web here <a href="http://paricols.mei30x.com" rel="nofollow">http://paricols.mei30x.com</a> there's no fee and you do not need a credit card.

(unless you are an extremely gifted artist)|`|xZ8Yt8QVaa	Do you have pictures of you two together? maybe you should get a picture frame and put the picture in.

I can't believe he said that I'm sorry it must suck...you should really tell him how you feel. If he really loved you then he wouldnt care!|`|aWgdX0pZaa	How long ago did you have the kid? Although most say he is a jerk, I think I know what he is doing. I have used this trick with my wife too and yeah it's a$$holish, but it's a last resort. He is trying to motivate you and he is totally lying. He is only saying it because he think if you think he doesn't find you attractive you will start taking care of yourself better. If it's been over a year since you have had that baby and you have not taken steps to try and lose some weight, you might want to do something. And ignore what he says about faking, again, it's a lie, us men never fake enjoy anything. We are still cave men regardless of the tens of thousands of years. <br>  <br>  Here's a good tip for yourself and your relationship, offer to work out together. I am sure he could lose a few pounds himself. Give you two some good together time as well.|`|cATZc4Kmaa	I know EXACTLY how you're feeling. My husband had been avoiding have sex for sometime and i finally got it out of him. [Now i kind of wish i hadn't] I know a marriage isnt all about the sex but shouldnt you at least LIKE what you're looking at? My husband swears he still loves me and all that but it really makes your mind wonder. <br>  <br>  Maybe try asking your husband if there's something he thinks you can do to be more appealing to him, besides work on your weight? Hopefully your husband will have a better answer then mine did [He said i dont know]<br>  <br>  I just kind of keep telling my self, "I know i look good especially since i had a baby. Not everyone can have a model like body" Some days it works.....some days it doesnt....|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I am sorry he hurt you by being honest about this.  I actually have a lot of experience with this topic:<br>  <br>  1. One thing is for sure, if you return to the shape you were in when he met you he will be craving you just as much now as he did in the beginning.  <br>  <br>  2. This is - almost word for word what I told my wife "BEFORE" we got married:  You are the ONLY person I will be physically intimate with for the rest of my life.  This is both a beautiful thing and a burden at the same time because I am not attracted to fat women.  And sex is a beautiful and important part of marriage.  So I want us BOTH to commit to staying fit.  I promise to help and support you, we will cook/eat healthy.  We willl exercise together.  Of course after babies there is a recover time.  But this has to be a priority to you.  Most Americans gain 2-3 pounds a year.  After 25 years that is 50-75 pounds.   Be honest, almost NONE of these people would have married each other at those weights.  <br>  <br>  And we both have and my wife still kills me after 20 years.<br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>>>><br>  As for all the comments about unconditional love.  Answer this question honestly.  Your husband loses his job (and he has a good job).  He takes a new job at minimum wage and doesn't even look for a position like his old one.  "Too stressful, I don't want to work that hard at it, he says."  <br>  Would your unconditional love cause you to treat him the same?  No way, first thing you would start having sex with him much less often.  And that is substantiated by a lot of research.   It is already happening in the current recession.  <br>  PS = for the women saying, no not me.  You might hang tough for a little while but after you really started to feel the impact.|`|DbNbWQflaa	well so much for unconditional love . where did it go . geez what a looser sorry but that how i feel about it, dont worry their are plenty of other guys, this is what you say im just too much woman for you and u and your limp thing can go on,
K2QwEM4raa	Most young people think they will live forever as did I. It was NOT your fault it is just one of those terrible things that happen in life. Try and remember your friend before the accident and realize the she will never have to suffer again, I know this is hard but time will help heal you . You want forget so remember the good times with her . We all make mistakes young and old and none of us are promised another day so take each day and do the best you can. Maybe donate some time to a worthy cause in her name. It can be as simple as helping someone that needs someone to get their groceries. So very sorry!|`|AA11286455	I am going to take a different point of view about the "blame" issue:  <br>  <br>  YOU urged him to go faster.  <br>  <br>  SHE urged him to go faster.  <br>  <br>  HE went faster.  <br>  <br>  The car crash happened.  <br>  <br>  This incident is not about blame, but about responsibility.  You share at least 1/3 of the responsibility for what happened.  Your friend shares 1/3, possibly more if she wasn't wearing a seat belt.  <br>  <br>  This is one time when responsibility should not be equated with blame.  In fact, you're probalby much better off leaving blame completely out of it, bc it will get you nowhere, except a miserable, vicious circle of misery and depression.  <br>  <br>  At this point it really doesn't matter who said what, did what, who sat where....None of that is going to bring your friend back, change what happened that night, or change the consequences of your choices.  <br>   <br>  ALL THREE OF YOU made choices.  Bad ones.  And now you have to live with them , as painful as this is.  You're probably going to feel miserable for a long time.  That's normal and to be expected.  <br>  <br>  You ARE in a position to go forward, live a more responsible life, remember and honor your friend, and ask her for forgiveness.  It may take some time for you to KNOW that she freely and readily gives it.  <br>  <br>  Do consider grief counseling to help you with this very traumatic experience.  <br>  <br>  We're all rooting for you.  <br>  <br>  And so is she.|`|f2fyXyulaa	Oh gosh I am so sorry about that!! There's nothing that you could have done. Don't blame yourself! You can't say "if I hadn't told him to go faster..." you can't. Learn from your mistakes and move on. The past cannot be undone. Don't blame yourself!! Just cherish the memories that you have of her. Good luck sweety and take it easy on yourself.|`|75y6lC7Naa	Don't blame yourself. You are not to blame.<br>  Alot of people in the world are in the same situation as you at the moment so remember you are not alone.<br>  What you have been through is terrible and i could not imagine how hurt you must feel right now.<br>  <br>  But whatever you do don't blame yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  You will never forget about this no matter what, but you will learn to live with it . and hopefully you will realise you are on this earth still for a reason. maybe one day your story of survival and hope will touch others that one day become in situations just like yours.<br>  <br>  <br>  God bless.<br>  X|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	Oh my God. I'm so sorry. No one should have to live with that. All I can say is that time will help. Know that it's not your fault. I'm sure her brother feels so much guilt, for he was the driver. I'm so so so so sorry. That's the most terrible thing, I can't even imagine the pain.|`|iJeGjRTTaa	Awww, that sounds downright heartbreaking! <br>  <br>  Just don't think of the past. You can really wish that you can change it but you just /can't/. <br>  <br>  Your friend wouldn't want you to be sad and mopey about her. She'd want you to continue having a fun time. <br>  <br>  You can wish to change the past but you just can't. <br>  <br>  c: Good luck.|`|YCclH6yRaa	I am so sorry to here this.....i really am. I don't even want to imagine. 1. It wasnt your fault, things happen. You have to stop beating yourself up. 2. its ok to cry, to let it out.....do it, it'll make u feel better. 3. talk about it, thts another way of letting it out. it takes time. Healing is a process. 5. Pray to God and tell him how u feel....trust me, by experience he knows what ur feeling......I'll pray for you. Let me know if u want to talk or pray together ok.

hCLmczgMaa	Im in the 9th grade also and i was in a similar situation as to you. I had my eyes on this girl and we didn't talk at all and now we basically talk all the time.<br>  <br>  here's what you do:<br>  <br>  just start any random conversation at school with him... ask him what he likes to do after school and stuff... and because its usually impossible to keep a convo going in school without being caught by a teacher u might later want to find a way to contact him after school via facebook/phone etc... and yea just be friends...|`|uMKoGhPuaa	don't ask him too many questions, it'll feel like an interveiw <br>  try talking about those 'mutual' friends you both had, maybe poke fun at them...<br>  instead of asking HIM to talk, you could tell him something funny that happened to you the other day or something... if he seems like he's not interested, he's either REALLY shy, or not interested...|`|KWv0IDSZaa	It will not be weird if you just start talking to him. just smile at him and be like hey. whats up. its what i do. after he answers compliment him and be friendly and then just talk about random ****. do this a lot and eventually you guys will talk naturally.
cRqCyIdRaa	You can help by just being there. She needs to find a way to grieve over this. By her self. I know that when this one person close to me died, I didn't cry until a week or more later. So just be there for you girlfriend. <br>  Good Luck.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Be with her.  Let her talk out her feelings with you.
cdt4F6ZWaa	I am so very sorry to hear that happened to your friend. I hope her killer is paying big time for their mistake.<br>  <br>  You can move on but you must also realize that you will never forget her.  I think what may help you get over this is to remember her for who she was and not focus on her death.  Try carrying her photo with you all the time, and when you see it, you'll most likely think happy thoughts.  If you think about what she meant to you and the good times you had together, rather than her death, you will be able to move on.  Although you wish you could change what happened, she would want you to move forward and enjoy living your life with good memories of her.|`|K2QwEM4raa	It takes along time. If you can't do it by yourself get help. Try and remember that God knows best even if we don't understand why. Try and remember her in good times. Sorry I'm not much help.|`|2KC467tFaa	Strange, it's been exactly 2 1/2 years since I was hit by a drunk driver. It was a fatal accident, but he was the one who died. I haven't lost a close friend, but I can understand the pain you're experiencing. Try to be happy about having dreams about her. It's sad when you wake up, but at least she's still alive in your dreams. My husband left for the Marines (different, I know) 4 months after we married. I loved dreaming about him. I felt like we were reunited. It's what kept me going. I'm sure your dreams will stop in time. It might be a natural way of coping. If it makes you feel better, you might consider being involved in MADD. Most are probably experiencing something similar to what you're going through. It's a way to channel your pain and help with a movement to prevent more tragedies like the one you're dealing with. I'm sorry for your loss. I hope things get easier for you.|`|MgMsMExPaa	Grief for me has been the hardest thing for me to overcome. Some of it is a shock and some of it is a relief. But  no matter what it is the un expected part of a sudden death is always  harder to handle. Of all the deaths in my life the ones that are sudden are the hardest for me to get over. All that you can do is move on with life and hope that you can find a new person to fill that void left by that death. I have had counseling and it dose help a lot. I always thought that it was all non-sense, but no more. I have a old friend who is a warden at a prison who holds a Phd. in psychology who talked me into counseling after my parents were killed in a auto accident. I am now a much happier person after I decided to go through with this. I know now that it dose work. Something el|`|AA12246255	My husband died in a tragic accident years ago in my 20's.  It just broke my heart and caused me a lot of grief. I do NOT know if you ever get over it but you learn to move on and keep busy so as to not think of the accident anymore...What helped me is when people ask??? and believe me they will..."how did it happen?"...( which i feel is very rude)...but they will still do it...just say.."I do not RE-LIVE that painful time anymore" and look down)...then slowly walk away...THEY SHOULD GET THE HINT TO STOP ASKING...I mean we have all had to 'LET GO"..or we wouldn't be able to survive. It is all about survival for us. It makes us weak...but years later we get stronger...take it from one who knows. I am sooo sorry for you grief.|`|u9I9jjF5aa	Seek counseling from the nearest profesional you can.  Whether it's a counselor at work or school.  Or you could try a therapist, though that may cost some money.  These people are trained to help people through tough emotions.  You might also try someone from your religious home, such as your priest, rabi, or etc.|`|q3UiNyDdaa	First, let me say how sorry I am that you had to go through the pain of losing someone close to you in that way.<br>  <br>  Now for the help. For the rest of your life, you will have times that you remember her, and each time it will make you sad. Just remember that "moving on" doesn't mean forgetting. However, you can, and eventually will, learn to cope with your grief in these sad times.<br>  <br>  My first suggestion is to get some counseling. The biggest problem with this is money. Counseling costs money, but you might be able to get some of it covered by health insurance. If you do decide to seek counseling, make sure you figure out what your insurance company will pay for. If you decide not to seek professional counseling, the next best thing is MADD (Mother Against Drunk Driving). Their website (<a href="http://www.madd.org)" rel="nofollow">http://www.madd.org)</a> has a lot of information that will be helpful.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|L9iM3OOjaa	I'm so sorry - that's awful! I don't think you'll ever "get over it" and she'll always be in your mind. When you wake up after a dream, I'd suggest just remembering the fun times and knowing that your friend is in an amazing place right now. Focus on the happier times and be grateful that you had the time with her that you did.|`|PLBIf2XVaa	WoW im SO sorry, **** happens. From the time the doctor slaps us on the *** we start dieing ,unfortunately some people life's are ended so suddenly and sadly . All we can do is pray and thank god we are still breathing and able to walk and do other stuff while we are still alive.|`|MTjUlIIkaa	get counseling ?
RVLTubfYaa	No you are not. It depends on who made plans first. If you asked first, and then her boyfriend did, that was indeed rude. It is a red flag-her boyfriend comes first. If her boyfriend asked first-then it's ok to feel sad, but you can't be mad at her. If you did indeed ask first, let your friend know that you are upset, and a little disturbed-will he always come first? Will she always ditch whatever plans she has with you if her boyfriend comes knocking? if she doesn't listen to you, or laughs you off, that is also a red flag. But you also mentioned she felt bad. So maybe she felt torn? You two should talk. Make up days where you two hang out, so her boyfriend knows that there are certain days/times that he can't spring a trip on her. Or double date. that always works. Good luck!|`|h8a5MWlTaa	she's making a mistake. if she keeps on blowing you off, when her and her boyfriend break up, you mite not wanna be her friend anymore. which is dissapointing. <br>  :( and no, ur not wrong. you should tell her how you feel.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	Girls start doing this. It depends:<br>  Who invited her first?<br>  If you invited her first then she flaked and you have a right to be disappointed, i don't think its anything to start a fight over, but I would explain to her that it was upsetting and you hope she has the respect not to do that again. <br>  Is this a lunch with you situation vs. a trip to san fransico with him? <br>  If ya'll had minor plans like a movie, or lunch and he invited her to a big trip I think I would be a little more understanding. <br>  <br>  Either way, if this is your best friend, talk about it.|`|q3UiNyDdaa	You absolutely have a right to feel sad and a little bit mad. If you made plans first, then you can be a little more mad. I guess it depends on how serious her and her boyfriend are. I wouldn't let it bother you too much unless she keeps doing it.|`|w2SPRMiraa	No. You have every right to be mad/sad. You should NEVER left a guy come between you and any of your friends weather best friend of just a friend..|`|hGIi4mKlaa	Its a girl thing. Honestly all girls are like that. Their scared that their bf would dump them. Pretty retarded but dw she'll mature eventually and so will her bf and he'll understand.|`|wwyvdGClaa	If she feels really bad about it, you should probably forgive and forget. Chances are, it won't happen again. <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you both.
U6rCN4R8aa	i've actaully been thru this before.<br>  but the kid wasnt my boyfriend, but we were "together" and i guess a public couple kind of. my friend told him that she liked him. right after she did he told me everything that happened and he said, but dont worry, i told her that i dont like her like that and that i like you and i like her as my friend.<br>  so dont worry, as long as he still loves you, it shouldnt matter. your friend probably did it spontaneously, dont get mad at her, its not worth it and its not her fault for what her hormones do.|`|FhKtIk2Paa	Uhhmm...I had a "friend" who did that and she ended up sleeping with my bf.  Tell her that she's allowed to like whoever she wants, but if she tries to sabotage your relationship with someone you love- then you don't want her in your life.  <br>  DO confront her, DON'T pretend this didn't happen.|`|59HXAtRHaa	WOW...  I'd want to confront her thats for sure!!  I'd be fuming to know that ur mate has the hotts for ur man...  Oii does she dress like you??  act like you??  maybe she wants to be you??  hehehehe<br>  <br>  she does have her reasons for not telling you thou..

I would never talk to or trust her again.|`|22A698zsaa	Honestly, I think that you need to just calm down and really go to a place where you can think clearly. I don't know how serious your relationship is but it's good to get in the habit of always choosing a relationship that is healthy for you. If it's a friendship that is tearing you down, or a boyfriend that is tearing you down, it's not healthy to be there. You need to be honest with yourself because you can ask someone else to be honest with you. Do you really want to be friends with this girl? Why do you think she would do it? Does your boyfriend have similar feelings for her? Do you think that either of them are making you a better you?

"Balmex" is an over the counter cosmetic that reduces redness in skin put that on and rub it in, at night before going to bed "benzoyl peroxide" keeps your skin healthy and lowers the chance of bumps redness and zits. Good cologne best brand for anyone is Fierce from Abercrombie & Fitch. style your hair different ways to change it up. find some nice belts with cool buckles, Express has some nice stuff. Walk daily and get sunlight and make sure you take Vitamin C, D, A and Iron supplements before you go to bed and wake up. CDA are good for skin, and iron is good to feeling great. and make sure not staying up late to reduce bags under your eyes the balmex like i said before will help redness it can help with black lines under your eyes. drink water and skim or 1-2% milk and no other kinds of sugar or juice liquids no soda cuz it ***** up ur system and does damage. take this advice coming from a former "big guy" and nutritionist you will lose around 5-10 lbs just by that alone everything else is just for skin and eyes and internal help. the walking will help skin color adds vitality.|`|GLLe7Hm0aa	You can work out and get a 6 pack, usually girls thinks its hot for a guy to have a 6 pack.<br>  And make sure you eat right too so your not too over weight or not too underweight.|`|ZttsT0n4aa	Confidence.

AA12391578	All girls, whether they admit it or not, are insecure about SOMETHING.  The best thing you can do is keep reminding her how fabulous you think she looks.  Maybe try to work with her on finding something that makes her feel amazingly hot, like a killer pair of heels or a cool purse or, if she's feeling adventurous, lingerie.  There are a lot of lingerie sites out there that have super cute items that are less revealing than others, and she may feel more comfortable being intimate with you if she doesn't feel, well, naked.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't give up!  I have an amazing boyfriend who kept trying to help with my insecurities and I have never been happier with myself.  :)|`|5wnqb95Taa	awwww it's so cute and lovely how you think she's beautiful in every aspect.....just reassure her and when you do look her straight in the eye and use a serious tone :)|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	i can relate to this so much because i am in the same situation with my guy. you just have to realize she appreciates that you love her for her and appreciate her but don't push her into doing anything that makes her think of her weight or that will cause the subject to come up. just be supportive. i know it's hard to understand and its sooo sweet that you see her beauty despite her flaws but everyone has things they are insecure about just support her. talk to her about it but don't get pushy. take care and goodluck.|`|kNLi16C6aa	I would as much as possible, tell her you love her.

tbEChzAGaa	I would be really hurt as well. But i have said things i meant when i was really upset myself. It can be refered to "kitchen sinking" bringing in all sorts of other little issues or something to aviod the one. Also this is a common feeling for women to have, that men put little effort into a relationship. This is basically the cause of socialization. usually it is womens jobs in relationships to do maintainance...also, don't ignore things he might be doing to show you he cares,...usually men will DO things for you to show he cares..house chores, fill your gas, change your oil...take out garbage....things like that<br>  otherwise...yeah that sucks...that should have never been said, and if there is an issue in your sex  life for real you should talk to him about it....and start working on effective communication skills
PBdPD748aa	honestly, it is quite unique due to its engravings so what i would do is print off that photo you have, take it into a jewellery store of your preference and ask them to make the ring for you. you can choose as to what metal you will prefer (white gold, silver, platinum) and it really isnt as expensive as you may think it is to get it custom made! it will be MUCH easier and more personalised that way :)|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	My fiance and I used this jeweler.

If its repeated, you need to consider whether you should put up with it or what.  As for the friend thing, that seems like jealousy to me.  You're probably reading too much into it.|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	Sweety if this guy really loved you he would never brag about your sex life like that, it's just rude...Give him a "wake-up: call and dump hiss *** and see if he changes any then you will have your answer|`|mVUpt8waaa	Either shut up and put up with it or give him the flick.

I've dated many-a-buttholes in my time and I've finally found someone who treats me with respect and kindness. I can tell the difference now.  You need to be with someone who respects you. The whole friend thing, I would be ticked about too... but also consider are they friends as well? He could have been just happy to see a friend, but if your sober gut is telling you it seemed a little too happy, it probably was. And as for the telling of the sex life, no no no. If you do decide to keep him, he has to treat you with the respect you deserve. That is a personal issue that he DOES NOT need to be sharing. <br>  I guess to sum up, I would talk to him tomorrow... get his opinion and if he treats  you like your stupid or makes you feel like your a crazy person, instead of actually addressing the issue, I think its time to move on from mr. immature to better things.|`|mJp8TsjDaa	It's obvious he disrespects you. And from my own experience in acting the same way, being over sensative to persons of the opposite sex that you are not around ALL the time is a sign that you find them attractive and if given the chance or oppurtunity you would try to play them into the bed or a sexual act of SOME KIND.  "En Vino Vera Tos" means that the truth is spoken as the wine passes over the tongue.  I know you dont know me, but believe me when I say he doesn't respect but loves you in his own way, would sleep around on you in an instant and the drinking makes it easier to deal with the things he is doing behind your back, has done or yerning to do. You have every right to be concerned. Intuition is the sixth sense.
gXIA9yHJaa	Well I must say if that avatar is really you I can understand why he hasn't came up to you and said anything. You look unapproachable to me. So I'm sure he figures why waste the time just to get told off. So if you really like him and have a crush on him like you said you do, go on and make the first move by talking to him. You may find out that he is THE GUY, you never know until you try it.|`|Nb1Dh2B0aa	All i can think is that he does like you a lot but is too afraid you will reject him if he asks you out, if he did, would you reject him? If not then try and give him a few not-so-subtle hints.|`|XUmPwKa7aa	It may seem like he's not interested in you but it could be the fact that he feels like he isn't good enough for you and afraid to look like an idiot as he feels like he will say something you will judge him on or something silly and unintelligent. <br>  <br>  You may have to make more effort to reassure him that you're actually interested. Lead the situation until he is more confident with you.|`|fRYzflBiaa	He's shy. You hold the power to change his life.|`|wJ5lCgpQaa	hes to shy and scared to talk to you
XH2o1MM6aa	.For the moment he's quite content to conquer you.Look if a guy questions your personal life.That's nt good.Frankly l'd reconsider this relationship.He's either immature or jealous. Not a great foundation for romance.
AA10458629	In a marriage there is no he's wrong and I'm right.  Sometimes being right is not that important.  Apologize to him and try sitting down and talking about the problem.  If he resists give him some time, what you say will stay with him.  Guys sometimes takes longer to process stuff but just because he don't want to talk about it now doesn't mean he isn't thinking about it.  Without know all the facts it's hard to give anymore advice than this.|`|LkUBeNTsaa	The problem begins when one of the partners or both of them starts saying that " I am right " . There is nothing like i am right in the love relationship.  Go and tell him that you feel sorry on his condition and you love him so much that you are dying to talk to him. You just cant see him disturbed and upset. So forgive you to make him feel sad and disturbed. Tell him that if he doesn't want to discuss the matter then you wont bring it up but also tell him that you are really disturbed about it. So, if he can coordinate about it a little with you then it will be helpful for you to be happy in life.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I don't think you should apologize for something you didn't do.  You can however apologize for hurting his feelings.  You can also reassure him how much you love him and that you are willing to work through this with him.  If it is a physical issue, encourage him to go to the doctor.  I think my SO and I had this same discussion last night.  He is hurt too.  Good luck.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	The damage is done and it is out there now deal with it and move forward if you back down now it'll always be in your mind and sooner or later you will bring it up again. Move forward work it out.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	it is not about taking blame but please try to understand a man this is something that we feel defines us and decides how much of a man we are to have your wife question this is worse than death so yes it is ok to say "i am sorry" and maybe just try to be there for him when he needs to talk to you about it|`|zwJbUbWMaa	You have already gotten to this point, don't backtrack.  You can apologize for the effect the discussion has had on him but don't apologize for saying what you said.  Continue to push for a solution.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	This is so vague I don't know what to say. Gnereally speaking, I don't apologize for things I don't feel I've done wrong, but you could apologize to him for upsetting him so badly, and tell him that wasn't your intention to upset him.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	We can't help you if we don't know what it is. Sorry. It might help to have the opinion of someone you both trust on whatever this is.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	marriage is all about compromise, sometimes you have to say sorry even when your right. usually when you do, the spouse will then also apologize and it makes it easier to come to a solution. so do it and trust that it will work.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I suggest persistance. You will hate yourself for giving in after coming this far and letting the problem go right back to where it was before. If you both cannot handle the discussion, perhaps just this once you might need the assistance of a third party: a marriage counselor.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	you have to tell your partner how you feel! Its not fun with him being affected by what you have to say,but if you want to change this then you need to stick by what you said. talk to him get his feelings it dosent mean that you have to apologize|`|NGKwsawdaa	I can't offer any suggestions until you offer more details. It all depends on what you both fought about.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	What is the problem and maybe I could give you insight to an answer you'd like?|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Ah, the great debate, is it more important to be right or happy....hard to figure...|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	your hubbie should be able to take some constructive feedback without falling to bits. <br>  <br>  If it is something he can help doing, then by all means ask him to change and express your feelings. If he can't help it? No reason to mention it.<br>  <br>  Women have a desire to apologize and smooth things out... But if it really bothers you he should want you to speak out about it.<br>  <br>  Offer to talk about it if he wants when he's in a better frame of mind, and remind him of the things he does that you do like.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	You can apologize for what you ARE sorry for, and that's for hurting your husband's feelings. Tell him you're sorry that he is upset that you brought up the issue, but that you felt it was important to share your concern with him and that you only want things to grow and become better between the two of you. Ask him why it is he is so upset, and how he would like to approach the whole situation. He may not be upset about the aspect of the conversation that you suspect him to be. It's important for you both to understand what the other person is thinking and feeling.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
y2Uks58paa	prolly he just sounds like a shy type of dude so he wont make it obvious|`|RKZHGqh7aa	It sounds like he likes you but is super shy.
jrtog7rUaa	He thinks you like him, being friendly is fine just make it clear. Plus you two were alone together, isn't that like a sign
LKUrX0jraa	No.....only 1 person id go gay for and I'm saving my butt for him....Brad Pitt!|`|9S2gFeyUaa	I would love it if the rock looked at me like that(2nd pic) HE'S HOT!!!|`|wVtdUZsqaa	hes being flirtatious thats a fact.!!|`|sSJ50ws7aa	How sweet!|`|MuXxUJvjaa	he wants to be your friend. Or maybe even more then just friends|`|ft8t98Pnaa	Honestly.....2 Pts|`|TLNQZ63baa	I'd pick a fight w/ him.
ig0Y3fE5aa	I have to start off with saying, since when is being tall a disadvantage :|<br>  Every girl looks for a tall guy. <br>  <br>  Girls at your age are superficial, and they don't understand the depth of a persons personality, so try and find some girls who are similar to you. <br>  <br>  For those people making stupid comments like OMG U NEVER HAD A GF:o:o ignore them, their 2 week "relationship" won't compare to what you may one day have.<br>  <br>  Wait, the right girl will come along soon enough and remember you are FAR from the only one without a girlfriend.|`|JZMfUDylaa	god I hated high school. people in high school have NO life. they did the same with me. your only 14! and when I had a boy friend people that never talked to me would ask me if I had sex. I mean really come on! get a friggin life people! yeah that's high school for ya hun. high school=stupid people. not all but most. just ignore them and be happy your not like them.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	be yourself<br>  because alot of girls will like you for yourself even if people say they won't.<br>  even if you need to wait loner it's better to wait for a nice girl than to get together with any old girl|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Just let it go, lol, that's peer pressure.|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much. My first boyfriend was 18 when I started dating him and he'd never had a girlfriend before. He wasn't ugly or anything, just had more interest in other things. <br>  Getting girls to like you? That's a tough one.. just be yourself. Eventually you'll find a girl that can deal with you just as you are. Start changing yourself for people and you'll end up miserable.<br>  And as for other guys giving you ****, tell them to bugger off. Tell them you're happier not being tied down to someone.. you'd rather be able to do what you want, when you want without a girlfriend wanting attention from you.|`|atNbl4ataa	hey nothing wrong for waiting for the write person. i was and still am alot like you, except girls just randomly started talking to me... anyways my first girlfriend is still my girlfriend after 2 years. nothing wrong with waiting. dont get caught up in the fake relationships they are completely pointless. and  i personally hate the guys that get a girlfriend **** her, and then move on to the next...|`|AJkHk25Zaa	1st question, Do you actually want a girlfriend or do you want one to fit in? Don't give in to peer pressure.<br>  If you actually want a gf just be yourself and make friends with some of the girls, that's usually the easiest way|`|5v0jWelOaa	im the same age as u<br>  <br>  these are the things u need to rember<br>  <br>  glasses are awesome<br>  <br>  randomness is soooooppppeeerrrrr<br>  <br>  people that say ily are completely crap<br>  <br>  we are 14 we dont need gf's or bf's<br>  <br>  and u r freaking awesome<br>  <br>  hi5 to the random dude who asked this question|`|PBmxi0fPaa	*sigh!<br>  im a 14 yr old girl and i feel the same way i mean ive had boyfriends but im sick of all the breakups its not fair im so sick of all these love stories! where's mine? where's yours?|`|ohj5sRpsaa	14 is young.|`|yH7OsFm8aa	You'll grow up to be a fox (;|`|93zL6EIYaa	hha okay.. yur nothing to bad. your only 14 .. date when you are ready and dont take crap from others like omg youve never had a gf! because i get stuff like this all the time.being tall acting weird and having glasses is pretty attractive in my opinion. idk. getting girls interested... umm. be funny, dont try to be annoying because you seem to already be aware that you are. and just be down to earth. before you approach a situation or  person think... "will what i am about to do be a good idea if i want these people to see me in a certain way?"|`|qlpjDvoNaa	You don't have to have a girlfriend in highschool. While it may seem like a big deal most of those don't last anyway so who cares. You don't wanna just be settling for anybody so hold out till you find a somebody. As far as being tall, that's gonna work in your favor down the road. Hit the gym and fill out your body...try not to be annoying and in college every guy will probably want to be u.|`|xzlmgH8baa	Most of it is bull crap. they say it to feel a belonging. Just think thats most of them some day will break up and be a wreck. I recommend dating around until u find someone worth a try lol. Sticking to one chick would suck. and i doubt ur ugly ur probably told that and thats all that sticks out. what about the quiet girls who think u r cute but ont say anything. keep trying.|`|WnYxPkMHaa	explain how they have 1 gf and ur getting with 3 girls :]|`|Y6IhTVW4aa	Lol this is normal really. People at my school go through this all the time.<br>  Step 1: Don't be such a *****. If you let them get to you, then their not just making stuff up. Your a *****. Who cares what they say, anyone saying that stuff is trying to make themselves feel better.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Find what works for you. You don't have to be ripped and good looking to get a girl. It helps. But you need to work with what you got. Maybe join a sport. If athletics isn't your thing just focus on being different, not weird crazy different, just not like every other guy. There's got to be a girl looking for someone unique.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Don't be shy. The worst thing you could do is separate yourself from the dating people. Talk to your friends, talk to your siblings, and when the opportunity arrises just go for it like a bamf. The worst thing that could happen is you could end up by yourself again. What do you have to lose?

ipdCTWXFaa	Well i totally agree with you!!!! everything he is doing are huge signs of liking someone. All i can say is to be patient and calm if you really like him you wont mind waiting a bit, it is known that guys take longer to mature. but when i Say wait don't wait forever no guy is worth that. all im saying is sit back and relax if he really likes you he will come and something tells me he does :]|`|7yM2doGlaa	Ask him to hang out! You've got nothing to lose if he likes you and you're not asking him to dat just to hang out one on one. If he seems toreally enjoy it maybe he'll ask you out or you can ask him.<br>  Be a little flirty, hug him sometimes and stuff, but continue being yourself and good luck|`|n90KqgAEaa	i also agree with them! Im going through this to.....he has such a cute smile! He probably is only saying that to hide his feelings. Expressing ones love is really hard.
SkB9i5pwaa	YESS he is totally interested.<br>  But maybe he is too scared to make a move...<br>  You should ask him on a date, and see what he says. Depending on how that goes, that should give you the real answer?|`|lLYywqYsaa	he likes u but doesn't want to....if that makes sense|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	He's stopping himself from liking you.  Does he have a gf?|`|d5lzqsxmaa	I think he likes you, cause if he didn't he wouldn't be flirting around with you. Also what he told his friend might be because he doesn't want anyone to know and he is not ready to admit it yet. Also it depends, the friend who asked him the question may not b a close friend with him. But im sure that he likes you. The ignoring may b because he might be confused about his feelings|`|28akIHxhaa	thanks for answering my question.  ok well personally i think that he really likes you but is unsure of how you feel about him.  that is why he ignores you. that is just from my personal experience but all guys are different. I hope this helps|`|2KhoQvmcaa	yes he does! its obvious but hes not going to tell your friend...cause things get around and they always change...so just talk to him!
1HWEsjZLaa	You could donate the clothes instead
EKRxqtzFaa	The "you" that you call your self is a giant filtering mechanism.  It is the sum of your cultural upbringing, your education, everything you've ever seen or heard in the past.  Everything you will see or hear in the future is colored by and interpreted through this living filter. <br>  <br>  No matter how smart you are, how educated you are, how rich you are, how whatever you are, this filter blinds you to the truth (the "secret of secrets", "face of the unknown").  At its very best the clarity of your own mental vision is like looking through a dirty window.  We are all limited by being human.|`|AA11391968	This means to me that the face of the unknown (Your Higher Power) would allow you too see the secret of the universe.(what I imagined).|`|iblT1HJpaa	Why are you asking us what it means for you? <br>  Are you 12?|`|8bTder08aa	It advocates the practice of self-effacement, grasshopper, which was a discipline that many radical groups of the 60's and 70's advocated, along with re-education through manual labor and eschewing material values.  <br>  <br>  The idea is that egocentricity, which is based on highly valuing self and equating merit with self-promotion and success as defined by acquisition of material, interferes with your oneness with the higher forces of the universe.  It's an advocacy of advancement by letting go, that only by concentrating on the diminishment of consciousness and concentration on self can one become truly self-aware.<br>  <br>  If you could lose your consciousness of self in the greater awareness of the universe around you, you would gain the gigantitude and magnificence of all the greater forces.<br>  <br>  (That, and probably smoking some kind of dope.  You hadda have been there, maaaaaaan.  It was like cosmically awesome, the ultimate high....)

Beezy anyways dont worry about it dude. Really think about it your only 15. You might find a girl your junior or senior year in highschool. And hey you know if you are desparate hit on the freshmen when your a senior or a junior. I know a bunch of people who do it. I dont though.|`|ozBkHxuHaa	No way! Relationships are over rated.

AA11584265	If you have a cell phone then ask him his number and put it in your phone while you are there in front of him. Then if he likes you...more than likely he will ask for your number to do the same. Its the 21st century the girl can call the guy too.
HJrTuihcaa	so what if your cousin and bestfriend think your a dork...your doing it for your aunt, not to see what people think of you.
1Q5XZgoiaa	Having the good face more than likely means that she has an average body at the least (meaning she isn't fat). So the face supersedes the body.|`|iMakU3RHaa	it is really both,but body attracts you more sexualy<br>  and face is more just of the person overall|`|Ltvcp5Iwaa	I'd probably say face, because you can always work on your body.  You are stuck with your face forever though.|`|tMON93tnaa	Body =P|`|7a51fc18f5c6477f0af393f7851e59bfaa	hrmmm...... Face, I think.<br>  Yea, face.|`|FLBF2Zm7aa	personality obviously, but i think face over body|`|kANR98tIaa	neither, its persoanlity that matters.|`|4awK3Lxsaa	Face.|`|kL6yQ5s2aa	Good Looks|`|61Wrl89Maa	Good Looks.
7a51fc18f5c6477f0af393f7851e59bfaa	There has to be an inital attraction I soley believe. We didnt walk up and talk with someone because of their personality is displayed on their face. It was the look that initially made you talk with that person. and once you talk to them and if you find that they have a good or bad personality from there we fall in love.|`|0ylm04PWaa	I cannot date anyone without having a charming and reliable personality. Personality affects how well you appreciate the good things life has to offer and how you cope with adverse situations. Good looks always nice to have with that, but I wouldn't turn away someone I felt a connection with because I really enjoyed the person thay are inside. Too bad someone I'd like to know more of cannot believe in that!!!!!!|`|LOROVDvcaa	i chose the ugly guy with the most amazing personality.  we were perfect when we were together.  i've never been as happy as i was when i was with him.  i've been with the hot guy with no personality and that didn't make me feel like i was in love, it just made me feel like i was popular because of who i was with.  that didn't make me feel happy.  i loved the ugly one and i wish more then anything that i could have him back|`|z9EGGerpaa	I like guys with a good personality.<br>  <br>  But usually, I'm not attracted to, well, unattractive people. Sorry if you don't really get what I mean, I'm not sure how to really explain it.|`|nqr74oc1aa	erm, in all fairness we do all go for looks. <br>  <br>  in my situation, i would only be interested in talking to a guy if he is attractive, i wouldn't look at an unattractive guy ... <br>  <br>  when i met my boyfriend i just went for looks, i saw him and thought WOW definitely would have to be with him... and then i got to know him, turned out that he has an amazing personality and amazing looks. <br>  <br>  i dont think its right to say looks or personality, because at the end of the day, everyone has their own type and saying someone is ugly or good looking is just an opinion.|`|MRUVo6tnaa	You make it difficult. you say the most unattractive person.<br>  <br>  I know that I would rather talk to someone who is not as attractive. But someone ugly, well, that's hard.<br>  <br>  My experience is though that I can rather count on people who do not look like people in magazines. That's what counts in the end.|`|dr0Mi2Cmaa	honestly thats pretty hard i mean i think we all wants are boyfriends to be good lookin but we also dont want him to be dumb soooooo im thinkin thats hard lol um personality cause if ur wit a hot guy n nothin to say its just gonna be based on hookin up n that gets pretty old after a while but when u have someone to talk to its good n there there for u n u can talk for hours about anythin n everything|`|CjFQJ0Xxaa	I think personality is what i see first. If they are a jerk, then I am not going to want to spend time with them. If they aren't that attractive but i can be myself around them without being judged, and just have a good time. Then i would pick the less attractive one any day :)|`|mPCAxtGZaa	looks and personality mixes. but if i were to be asked personally, i'd rather date a guy with great personality, rather than a guy who looks great but mistreats me big time.|`|rvrGhvKCaa	I would date the one with the personality, because I don't care about looks.|`|vLTYusHIaa	I am going with the guy that has a great personality not the looks. I can rest assure that I won't be bore or being hurt.|`|cX7J2bQhaa	It is a mix of both, honestly.<br>  But if I were to choose one, I'd say with a great personality.|`|3UlGItEEaa	I have tried to date because of personality, but it turned out to end as a strictly platonic friendship. I prefer a physical attraction as well as mental one.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Nobody goes for someone unattractive regardless of personality unless they are unattractive themselves.<br>  <br>  Sad, but that is the way it is.<br>  <br>  Now if you are beautiful with a unflattering personality, you will still get lots of dates, but your long term relationships will all but dissolve once your partner finally gets tired of your crap.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "Guys and dolls" thought ugly is the "same" as average looking, just FYI

If your actually wanting to be in a long relationship, just take it slow and find out what they like be a friend first.

Forget it.  Unzipping his jeans, getting a total makeover, or outwardly flirting with him won't work.  Any one of those things may be successful in getting in the sack with him, and might even be successful in getting him to like you more.  But the relationship is doomed.  You weren't attractive to him.<br>  So now you should ask, "What should I do to be attractive to guys?"   The answer is pretty obvious, accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative, and improve on the rest.<br>  <br>  Consider the things that guys find attractive and think on what you can do.<br>  In no particular order -<br>  Attractive personality (typically this means the gal shows interest in HIM)<br>  Attractive looks (This can be broken down to favorite bodyparts and style. Guys tend to be specific about which bodypart they care about. Those interested in pretty faces don't care much about big b...s. How you wear your clothes and present your style. If you look like you could be on a magazine cover, then you're too high maintenance and only attractive to guys with very deep pockets. On the other hand, if your clothes don't fit well or inappropriate for your figure, you're on the bench watching the game.)<br>  <br>  Similar interests (Guys that are very fond of beer are more impressed by gals who nix the white wine and get bud. Guys who love football are more interested in gals who know the nicknames of the top 20 college teams and are not interested in gals who can name the last 10 winners of Wimbledon, French open and US open tournaments.)<br>  <br>  Food (Yes the best way to a guy's heart is his stomach. If you don't know how to cook, learn. Guys tend in america tend to be singleminded when it comes to cuisine : generally meat, potatoes, pizza and beer. But if you want him raving to his buddies, invite him over for a dinner of chicken parmesean made with fresh cheese, a tossed salad with greek dressing and feta, boiled baby carrots, and a desert as simple as 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream with a teaspoon of vanilla extract dribbled on top.)<br>  <br>  Self reliance & independence ( This is somewhat of a 2 edged sword. Most guys have a need to feel appreciated. If you are totally independent, then they can never do anything for you that you can give them appreciation in return. Similarly, many guys want to feel wanted and not just for their bods. On the other hand, as stated earlier about needy guys, many guys want somebody who will be able to take care of THEM!! Not that they are mommas boys and incapable to live on their own, but ... If you are totally NON self relient and live off big macs, pay a service to clean the apt., and call an electrician to change lightbulbs... You're on the bench with the big girls in tight knit suits.<br>  <br>  Confidence (Shy people who never look a person in the eye and never make an opening comment or first move become invisible. But this too can be a double edged sword. Look a guy in the eye too much and many will be intimidated. Other guys will interpret it as a sexual interest you don't intend. But a gal who holds her head up, speaks her mind, dances like nobodys looking and can take risks.... guys drool)<br>  <br>  Education (But not too much. Idiots are a dime a dozen. Guys find the female cast from Married With Children are attractive in only 1 way and guys wouldn't want them still there in the morning. On the otherhand, dont let a guy know you have a masters very early on. Let him find out.)<br>  <br>  Being EASY (This too is double edged. Too easy and you'll be a one night stand. Sworn to celebacy, and you're on the bench with the bad dressers.)

ukBX5OOsaa	I would say yes and see where it goes but I wouldn't think much of it if it was with a guy that has a player reputation; biggest turn off for me. <br>  But maybe that girl was nervous and made an excuse or she really has a boyfriend, just find out, it won't hurt. Good luck!|`|0DdSoi4Maa	No, I would not be nervous just b/c the guy is a player & reject him.  So you're saying she really doesn't have a bf she just made it up?  If she doesn't maybe she's testing you or.  Usually when people say they're dating someone & they're not means they're not interested in you...just a nice way of saying no.

Simply we choose to dream about fun and happy thoughts. So if you and your b/f are getting along then it is normal to dream about him. I dream about my relationships all the time....some dreams ...some nightmares lol.<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  matt|`|AA11721065	Yes, that person is always on your mind, consciously and unconsciously.

uIlPYa2Waa	I was going through the same thing lately. I started taking it one day at a time by making small goals. This has worked for me lately. Then I found something to look forward to. Recently I signed up for a 5k for late March. It has kept me motivated because I want to make good time on at that race. I hope you find your motivation back and not feel so depress about things. I know its hard because I am living it right now. Best of Luck!!
lyuWTIo6aa	do you have any friends you can ask for a ride but why dont you try getting a job cause there are some people out here that are as poor as you but even worse..like my family are in big debt and were basically becoming poor but i applied everywhere i could think of and got a job that pays a lot since i have a lot of hours and im saving up my money for a car..im only 16 too but yeah i agree yoour parents are uggggggghhhhh!!! ...um childish??..mines are kind of like that..it drives you crazy huh but wow if i were you i would move out when you go to college!|`|IWP0gop5aa	Point out that they were the ones that forgot about you in the first place and that they broke a promise. Tell them you have a right to be mad and that they are just being selfish. If that doesn't work, just break down in front of them (for show). Pretend to be absolutely catatonic! Be miserable and irate. Just show them how much pressure you are under. Let them know what they are doing to you. If that doesn't work. Move in with a friend cause they must have hearts of stone!

I just don't get it.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Well I've read all the other answers and most are pretty good but may I give you a suggestion? Try buying a bike or something, I'm pretty sure it won't take you that long to be able to buy one<br>  <br>  Tough situation, your parents are really unfair.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Sounds like they're kind of childish.  Probably time to move out.  Why can't you drive?  Maybe it's a hint?|`|UZ8wsmuFaa	Sometimes when we remind people too much it has the opposite effect. Your parents likely hear you ask for lots of things and have learnt to turn off to what you have to say. <br>  <br>  If you talk less they will listen more. Let them rant more and pretend you are interested in what they have to say. People never listen when they have something to say themselves.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to stand more on your own feet and just use them for accommodation. Pay them a set rent per week and put the rest into savings, in case you need to move out, or you or your family have an emergency that requires some savings. Think of them as landlords for a while and practice what it would be like to live in your own place. Be polite but keep out of their way.<br>  <br>  Parents don't need a licence to have children. Some people just are no good as parents. My dad never wanted me and it was obvious to me that he would have preffered to not have the burden of children.<br>  <br>  Get a car and licence or have taxi money hidden for emergencies or car pool. Do whatever you can to get more independant. If you are more independant you might be seen as less of a drain and more of an asset. Likely they worry about you, and still feel you need their help and guidance. If they have been worrying about you for 18 years, the habit is hard to break. Similarly if they have been bossing you around for 18 years, that habit is also hard to change.<br>  <br>  Also make a big effort to help out with cleaning and chores. make new friends who might help you out if you had to move. Maybe get involved in an exchange program to visit another city or country. Sometimes Community or church groups  have student  or volunteer exchange programs. My dad joined the Army to get away from his mother. <br>  <br>  Finding a second job might also help but you might be better focussing on an education. Appreniceships are a happy medium.<br>  <br>  Some poor families spend their money on drink and smokes rather than groceries. If you parents are money wasters giving them a set amount they have to use and having your own stash of food will teach you and your family to budget better.<br>  <br>  If you are no good at cooking ad shopping for yourself learn fast. If your parents can not shop for themselves do the shopping for them buying fresh vegetables and less junk food. Cook the meals for the family giving them a break from cooking. make their lives as easy as you can. Focussing on getting angry only causes you guys to fight against each other making your lives worse.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we do the right thing and expect others to appreciate it. Sadly they often don't. Do not let that from stopping ypou from being nice, just make sure you can stay on your feet better so you can more out or be more help tp your family.

pWArTam4aa	A romantic guy who wants to make me happy.  My friend's boyfriend is so adorable.  He says "I want you to be happy.  I would never want to do anything to hurt you.  I love you so much and I want to be sure that you are safe."  He's so sweet!  (And no, I'm not interested in him like that.  he's just the example of the kind of guy I like)  A sense of humor is very important; I want to laugh with him, toss around jokes, and smile, as well as making him smile.  I'm a rather sarcastic, cynical person sometimes so a clowny guy might be good for me.  And not that I can't protect myself, but a defender might be nice.  Someone smart who can handle themselves in public is important and I want him to be honest with me.  Have a physco ex-girlfriend you're not sure you want to tell me about?  Tell me.  I'm not usually too psychotic and being honest with me just makes me trust you more.  Physically?  Any color of hair, any color of eyes... I'm not really that particular.  I just want him to be taller than me, have a decently toned, muscular chest, and have long arms to cradle me with!  I like a guy's winning smile from across the room, as well as a sweet blush when I catch them staring at me.  A guy who loves giving and receiving hugs (because I do!) is great and... umm... I don't know.  I personally tend to like guys who have issues or are emotionally unstable become they seem so raw, masculine, sexy, and helpless all at the same time.

Normally, the cooing is there way of communicating with you.  It is normally from four to six months before they are able to start saying things like mama and dada.  Overall, it really depends on the child.  All kids develop at different levels.|`|AA12377071	edl start walking by 7 month, as for the talking l don't know|`|34969b291a84f695f9944f6feeb82faeaa	It just depends.  All children are individual and therefore grow according to their own time clock.  I want to tell you to enjoy the younger years.  Remember that everything you do will have an influence on your child.  My daughter is 16, and wow, if I could turn the clock back, I sure would at times.  It's hard in today's world, because of all the earthly influences.  You just have to love them and pray for them, that they will make the right decision, whatever it may be regarding.|`|AA12361935	Between twelve and fifteen months, babies begin to use words.  This includes using the same sounds consistently to identify an object, such as “baba” for bottle or “juju” for juice.  Many babies have one or two words and understand 25 or more.  He will give you a toy if you ask for it.  Even without words, he can ask you for something- by pointing, reaching for it, or looking at it and babbling.  <br>  <a href="http://www.zerotothree.org/tips/learningtotalk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zerotothree.org/tips/learning...</a><br>  <br>   During his first year, your baby is busy developing coordination and muscle strength throughout his body. He'll learn to sit, roll over, and crawl before moving on to pulling up and standing at about 8 months. From then on it's a matter of gaining confidence and balance. Most babies take their first steps sometime between 9 and 12 months and are walking well by the time they're 14 or 15 months old. Don't worry if your child takes a little longer, though. Many perfectly normal children don't walk until they're 16 or 17 months old.<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/refcap/toddler/toddlerdevelopment/6507.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/refcap/toddler...</a>

HnEcgVGiaa	You aren't in love with him. I've read your other questions to get a better sense of where you are coming from. I believe the problem arises from your currently situation with your family. Your father has disappeared somewhere, your mom has hurt you and blames on you for her misfortunes. Because you are lacking love from your parents, you are seeking attention from somewhere else - anywhere.<br>  <br>  The guy's asking you for naked pictures, and you're just a teenager. If he's got any common sense in him, he knows that this is just wrong. You need to have more respect for yourself and not give in that easily. Just because you have problems within your family doesn't mean that you should make yourself weaker to be accepted by other people.<br>  <br>  You need to learn to be stronger and more independent. Focus on your own future. Get your grades back up and plan on going to college to find a career path and you'll enjoy. You really shouldn't give up on life like this. What you're doing is just surrendering.<br>  <br>  Pick up the courage; I know it's in there somewhere. Do not worry about relationships, but concentrate on getting your life back on track. You need to train yourself to stand against all the obstacles in your life and learn from your failures. Do not be discouraged by those failures, but take them as life lessons and apply them to your future.<br>  <br>  You deserve so much, and you do not realize this. Listen. You need to come to your senses and see how you have been treating yourself. There will always be outside forces that will pressure you, but you must withstand them. Seek support from people that you can actually trust. Know whose shoulders you can cry on.<br>  <br>  But most importantly, seek the courage within you and fight on with life. Sometimes, you will be alone to battle the challenges, so it's going to be up to you! Everyone goes through this; you're story is no different. Be tough and hang in there.<br>  <br>  Let us know if you need further help.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian
q3UiNyDdaa	Well the statistic about how many people become repeat offenders depends on what she went to jail for. Try to be encouraging to her, but always keep a watchful eye on her, especially since there is a baby involved. Don't be afraid to call child services or someone if she falls back into old habits and puts the baby in danger. Try not to turn into just another person who is telling her to change, but don't pretend like nothing happened. If you see her slipping, be more aggressive about telling her to stop whatever it is that she is doing.|`|BXd4I9mmaa	Statistics say very few change their ways.

IX5B0zrQaa	It’s understandable that you feel used as a friend. <br>  <br>  It comes down to how much you value the friendship against how much you’re prepared to put up with. It sounds to me like you’re on the brink of being pushed over the edge but I would just recommend doing everything you can first to save the friendship, especially as you have such a long history together.<br>  <br>  You could try to talk to her and tell her how you feel. Tell her that you value the friendship but won’t accept being lied to when her boyfriend suddenly becomes available. You've shown her loyalty and you expect the same. There's nothing there that's unreasonable is there?<br>  <br>  Should she continue to treat you badly then I think the relationship will take its natural course and you’ll either drift apart or you’ll be so fed up that you’ll decide enough is enough.

Para procriar e cuidar do lar...<br>  <br>  Acredito eu que essa mentalidade está mudando... Mas esse negócio de abra?ar,e de carinhos, acontece no inicio do namoro, no qual o homem tenta conquistar a mulher, e depois que consegue....

It means like OMG!!!!!!! It's just another phrase used to emphasize that. It came out in the 90s. Shows like "Moesha" and "The Parkers" were avid users of this phrase. Use it whenever, but it is kind of played out. So I wouldn't even worry about it, it's slang just like every other made up word. I hope this answered your question.|`|f5888d532f37b2f14c2801dac02b6487aa	Usually these days, it takes the place of "Oh, burn!"

7CKipTZOaa	I personally prefer simpler bands but I think both are lovely and the fact that the round diamonds will make the solitaire pop. If you love it then go for it!|`|PBdPD748aa	i absolutely love the engagement ring.... probably because mine is sooo similiar! i have a 1.2 carat solitaire princess cut (we designed our own setting) and it is so elegant and timeless! go for that engagement ring for sure!!!<br>  <br>  as for the wedding band, to be honest, it takes away the simplicity and class of the solitaire in my opinion. i really dont like it.<br>  <br>   i am getting a channel set princess cut wedding band and it looks really really stunning. have you thought about even a channel set wedding ring with round diamonds if you dont want princess?<br>  <br>  ah anyway you decide to go, as long as you love it on your finger and you think you'll love it in 20 years then thats all that matters!|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	if you love the way it looks then by all means get it.  i don't think matching is super important.  my rings don't match and i don't realy care.  my engagment ring was a solitare blue diamond, set in white gold, and the wedding band is just a plain white gold band,  noone has ever said to me 'oh those aren't a set" it won't matter. get what you love!|`|AA12204435	ITS BEAUTIFUL|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	I don't think the stones are too much, but I don't think the band goes with the engagement ring. have you tried them together? The band on the engagement ring is straight, and typically a solitaire is set high enough that you so not need a curved band to go around the center stone of the e-ring. The band you listed is curved, and if you need a straight band (which it looks like you do). i think the concept is nice, but these together may leave you with a curve/gap between them. Don't buy something without trying it on first! good luck|`|WaTezVS0aa	The only opinion that matters is your own. If you love the rings together, get it. You are the one that is going to be wearing it for the rest of your life. I think it looks beautiful! Congrats on the engagement and upcoming wedding!|`|FYnCohXYaa	IS that you guys on the photo?<br>  if it is you guys look cute and happy together<br>   i really like the first ring it's fancy.<br>  Your getting married on my sister's b-day,anyways congrats!!|`|8g51eBf1aa	I like them both. I will look good together, and it will be different then everyone else'.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	OMG its so cute... you dont even know... i love it|`|aR8fwFW8aa	I like them both.  Very nice.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well, first off I wouldn't mix cuts of stones. Secondly, I just think that band is 'too much'.  I would definitely go with something simpler.|`|wC51rE1gaa	i like that a lot! get them welded together!

If she doesnt want to be your friend anymore then that is because she is jelous that she couldnt get him.

Be sensitive to her feelings when you tell her, and hopefully by the time you tell her she'll be interested in someone else.<br>     In regards to asking him out, I say go for it. Like I said earlier, wait until she seems over it, but definitely don't let him get away. I know what its like to let that happen, and its much worse than taking a chance, which I've done too. Its worth the risk to give yourself peace of mind.|`|da96373dc87a95f9bc11d7754846f9b8aa	I think you should sit her down and tell her that you didnt want to tell her to hurt her feelings but now when you saw that he doesnt want to go hang with her.

VdLuqgiGaa	You need to become more assertive. Make your responses straight and to the point. Don't be apologetic about your decisions and choices in life. The more you try to explain your decisions/choices, the more insecure and apologetic you appear to be about them, and the more likely people will try to pressure you.|`|AA11414777	My daughter says that I try to tell her how to run her life.

My daughter usually asks me why I think it would better her life if she does what I suggested and if I can give her a good enough reason, she will try the suggestion.  You could try asking your friends the same.  Or you could just be polite and tell them you will think about their suggestion and then do what ever you want to do.

Doesn't your husband know that it should be "Our" money and that once all the bills are taken care of with both wages then whatever is left over is split in half as "play money"?<br>  <br>  Sounds like your husband is a selfish jerk and so you should just do what ever will make you happy as he doesn't seem to care how unhappy your are as long as he has everything he wants.|`|5eCYQFU1aa	well you could quiet your job and  have no daycare costs or you could work opposite his hours I did when my kids were little and its was hard sometimes but I was nice not   having to make supper and clean up the messes  my husband had to do it and he did a great job|`|xNWqqlcYaa	you 2 sound so dumb and immature to have kids.|`|2aQbutN1aa	the two of you should never have made that agreement in the first place because the fix that youre in now is usually the typical outcome when such agreements are made... being married means sharing. and that means everything... and working together to make sure the family is taken care of. you are part of that family, too. you need to come to some type of compromise before you make the change. he is not obligated to help you with that, but he might be more willing to help if you work together to come up with a different solution that works for all of you.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	You took an oath when you got married, but not to keep the same job you hate the rest of your life. You really shouldn't consider the extra income either of you have as yours by yourself, it should be split down the middle. But if you guys want to work like that then you can.. Remind him that one day he could get laid off or want to leave his job. Marriage isn't 100% buisness, your suppose to encourage each other's growth and cover each other's asses. The future is unpredictable. Either one of you could one day be out of a job and depending on the other. Marriage is 50/50 when you can and when your it's not 50/50 you do your best. Life is not perfect and neither of you will always be able to cover the bills 50/50 all of the marriage.
f9sL3WgQaa	I tend to give in more to what he wants to do because he does pay the mortgage yes. I would love to scream my head off at him for never doing his laundry or doing dishes because he spends 4 hours on the freeways and 12 horus at work everyday.  Yeah..I tend to give him more lead way..and thank everyday we are not one of those who are in foreclosure!<br>  <br>  yah' have to learn to pick your battles.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	I tell you one thing, if this is what you young women have to put up with, no wonder there are so many divorces.<br>  <br>  I stayed home with my kids too, and I can promise you my husband never once said anything about quiting work.  He helped with a colicky baby a lot at night and still went to work everyday.  I have never walked on eggshells around him. <br>  <br>  Life can be a lot better than what you're putting up with.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	What kind of a baby are you married to?  Threatening to quit his job if he doesn't get his way. Your ideas don't matter to him because you don't matter.  Sound like it is his way or the highway.  Eventually you will find the highway to your liking.|`|AA11996507	So why are you still with him?  Do you think you're teaching your kids a good example of how a relationship should work?|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	I'm not exactly sure about your question but it sounds like your husband is walking all over you.  He criticizes you, he tells you that your ideas won't work, he doesn't listen to you.  On top of that, you're walking on those eggshells because you're so afraid of what he'll say or how he'll react to you on any given day.<br>  <br>  Honey, this is not a marriage.  Are you ever happy in this marriage? Or is every day the exact same thing, walking on eggshells because you don't know what his mood will be?  This is not a way to live.  Your husband should be one you look forward to seeing after work.  He should be open to your ideas and suggestions. He shouldn't be putting you down.  He should be thrilled to come home to you and your kids.  If he isn't, I wonder why you stay with him.<br>  <br>  But the worst part is the lack of communication.  I think at this point, you guys don't have a chance at a happy marriage unless you seek counseling, together.  If you or he doesn't go, well then you're stuck there in eggshell land.....good luck.....|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	Honestly if your husband gets that angry with you if your in a bad mood when he gets home from work and threatens to quit his job than you can do a whole lot better than him. You are the one raising the kids, cleaning the house, and basically sitting at home and probably don't have a life outside the home than he can learn to deal with it!! I am a at home mother myself and I don't have a life outside of our home cause I have no friends around here and I don't have a vehicle to go visit family whenever I want to either. If he can't be a man and listen to you when you talk to him and than complains about it when you try than your way to good for him and he doesn't deserve you and you shouldn't have to do everything he tells you anyways. Last I checked he is your HUSBAND not your father!!!|`|PiczCyjbaa	Um, if you don't act right he'll quit his job?? Um, seems to me that he'd be doing a disservice to himself by quitting his job. If there's anyone else you can stay with - like family, maybe you should let him quit his job and then go stay with your family. Then he'll realize how dumb he is. He'll lose his job and family.<br>  <br>  And no, I don't feel I have to do what he says to get the bills paid, because he doesn't pay the bills, I do!|`|BXd4I9mmaa	Believe me, I know how you feel.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Wow, sounds like he is holding you over a barrel on this one. He sounds passive aggressive (look it up on the Internet), and he is controlling you. No one likes that. It will drive you away one day.<br>  <br>  Read up on how to deal with a passive aggressive.
PBdPD748aa	yes i would be offended because i wouldnt appreciate that sort of comment about something so personal to my fiance and i! a wedding date is such a personal thing, and once you have announced it everybody should be happy, excited and accepting - not picking what they think suits them. that is terrible. absolutely rude.|`|qfUjyUDTaa	I agree with Danni...that is terribly rude! You dont call up the bride and groom and suggest a different date that suits you better! Thats terrible! <br>  <br>  You accept the date, be happy for the couple and do your best to attend!!|`|66393fcb8deb9226aa9427ed74300258aa	It would depend on why they wanted it changed. If there was another big even happening that weekend already (another family wedding, a graduation, etc.) then it would be better to at least consider moving it. If it's because of selfish reasons like they just don't like the date or they are planning a trip that can be easily moved to another date. Also depends on how close a relative they are. Parents,  grandparents, siblings, or close aunts or uncles, then you should consider switching. If it's some distant relaitve, like a third cousin, then it doesn't have as much weight on your decision. In the end, it is up to you and your fiance.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Yes- that date is nobody's decision except yours and your fiance's.  Besides,sometimes the date you pick for your wedding has a special significance.  For example, my fiance and I are getting married on the 7-year anniversary of the day we first met.  If anyone tried to get me to change that date simply because it didn't work for them, I'd just cross them off the guest list no matter who they were!!<br>  <br>  Of course, I once had someone try to get me to change the date of my birthday party, which was, you know, my birthday- because it "didn't work" for her...so I'm not the least bit surprised at peopole's rudeness and egocentrism when it comes to things like setting dates and such.|`|FgjI26QNaa	I don't know that I would be "offended" BUT I (me personally) would ignore their suggestions send them an invitation....I would be upset and think that they would be happy for me and do all they could do to attend.
dCmSA6r2aa	nope sorry don't want to be a trophy of a black guy|`|ZITL8kSiaa	yess some girls like black men.... like me lol!|`|37M3dkkRaa	its not about race, its about the person they are on the inside. can you help it you're whatever race you are? no...and i can't help it either. no one can so you can't hold it against them. i've never been with a black guy, but i do know that latinos have the right to brag about being latin lovers....|`|mCoipTkbaa	2 pts.|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	I don't see what the big deal is..they just have good taste.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	I have just read 17 other answers to this question, and I have to admit, YOU are a bigot if you actually believe this racial crap you are spewing here. TWO words, URBAN MYTH. Exactly NONE of the white women in my 60 years of life experience have ever expressed this "secret love" you claim. A more enlightened man or woman ignores race or color and if this is true as you assert, then these women are racist against WHITES. I have NO doubt that exceptions exist. I have no doubt that there is at least one woman who secretly loves black guys just as I believe there is at least one white man who secretly loves black women. There is no general rule here and if you believe there IS, then you are as stupid as the one or two stupid people who actually may hold this racist, bigoted belief. <br>  <br>  The thing is, about women, ALL women are pink inside and bleed red blood. So, I have to ask... What does the color of the wrapping paper have to do with the contents? And WHY would YOU think there is some correlation or general rule that applies here?|`|vg9OYsKFaa	no its not true. and its not false. lots of women like black guys, but then lots of white women like white men or hispanic men or asian men. it all depends. there are some areas of the world where a certain race is mroe attracted to another race because of how scarce they are. my friends in germany said that a lot of the german women love the black men there because there arent a lot of black men in germany. it all depends|`|d1Wx6fqqaa	I don't lean towards a specific ethnic group when loving someone :) To me, ethnicity does not matter. White... black... brown... yellow... we're all the same underneath our skin.<br>  <br>  I personally judge guys by their personality, not appearances, but I guess my way of judging is a part of a minority these days...|`|c3j49t9Faa	No, not all white girls like black men. That is just silly.  Sometimes you like the person first before you see the skin color...so if there are white girls digging on black men that's ok or asian men digging on black women or white men digging on donkeys.  Its all good|`|ze4Gt1araa	Well me personally, yes I love black boys I've never dated a white guy but yet again girls are different.|`|W1TBjF5caa	false.|`|PmYpNontaa	What does it matter unless it matters to you.  Long question for something you make doesn't seem to be about you.|`|fDcR0mfnaa	Black guys are REALLY cute! But hey thats my opinion. But in my case, HELL YA!!!!!!|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	false|`|2Qe9iMhtaa	Ok no and no. Some black guys like white girls not all. And some white girls like black guys but not all. And especially not secretly. Some women fantasize about being with a black guy but not all of them. I've met several white women who can't stand the thought of a black guy doing anything to them. And its come up in conversation between a few black guy friends of mine that they just don't like white girls. But its like a gay and straight marriage. You hear more about the people that get married who are gay then you do about people who are straight who just got married.|`|2DDVJSp7aa	Lol.. I think a lot of the time it's them being conceited then again, people can be attracted to whoever and it rarely has anything to do with race. I personally think black guys are really hot, and have another friend of European descent who feels the same way.. (She's obsessed) Then again I have other white friends who aren't attracted to African American guys. It really depends on personal taste.|`|tUDgxv88aa	Some like black men...some don't. I personally do not. I just don't find them very attractive. I like my guys with blond hair and blue eyes...I don't know why...but every one of my boyfriends have had blond hair and blue eyes. just a sucker for it I guess.|`|syJtpGFhaa	a white girl dating a black man is dangerous in a girls mind because they do it to upset their parents. the stereotype that black men are bad to date is stupid. the color of someones skin doesn't determine their attitude. But most african americans don't do much to help their stereotype just like us italians everyone thinks we eat only pasta and bread and are fat or have to wear expensive things. or the fact that irish people like me drink a lot. 1/2 1/2 italian irish. i may not drink but i do love pasta and italian food above most. not all girls have a secret desire for black men. some girls are scared of what their parents might think white supremist or catholic raising. others don't have preferances. it is wrong to think that black guys are dangerous cuz women think they are getting a thrill from hanging around them or dating them. and i have seen it first hand some african american males are asshole to their causcasion female partners my roommate in college was the worst. but my friend from home has a girlfriend who is white and he is black her parents do not approve cuz they are closed minded but they still lead a good relationship. he has a very cultured view of relationships and she is strong as well. so it is not all white girls just select individuals who have gotten some wrong information growing up.
AA10953000	Because some American men have tiny, tiny penises and know they can't please an American woman, hell, probably not even a Canadian woman. So they go to cultures where the women are small, submissive, and easy to abuse and control and find a woman there that they can take out their inferiority complex and insecurities on.|`|AA11512648	Asian women know how to really please a man. I mean really!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12148351	cuz they like east asian women|`|de04abcdfbcf12c1656f44dd8dd5f39baa	You men need  to explore more out there don't just marrie the first girl you see .

LO5aGYZHaa	Cut his limitations very very(I'm talking about VERY)short.Be like"Well since i see that damn game is more important than me...".Or just tell him.Say"I think your seriously neglecting this relationship....and me."|`|EYt8H5N2aa	You cant make him do anything that he does not want to do but you sure can encourage him though. Cut him off from things that you normally do and see if things change. What does he love about you? You sweet kisses? Of that is the case, cut his sweet kisses off to only a few. Just cut him off a little bit and see if things change. If it does not, I'm sorry, there is no changing that guy.
AA11991280	well so what if u have a son u shouldn't stop urself from dating  other people because I'm sure there is a guy out there who simply will care for ur son just the way he is.

But don't bring him around your son until you think the relationship might go somewhere.|`|8a0ce89ccfc05affc50c7dd9680fa46daa	Of course you can't let a child hold you back when it comes to stuff like that a friend of mine was engaged got pregnant and it didnt work out the father totally not there for her baby who is three years old now. The last man she was with was ''the father'' and she is the most unhappiest person i have ever seen she loves her son and wants to pertect her son from the confusion of '' Who is my daddy'' see the trick to it is first off make dates for you with guys who fit your type and if you find one that seams good then make things about your son. Childrenn reflect on their parents if you unhappy your son will be unhappy.|`|91cb2e1e52d4ab734529aa96eaba629faa	If you as cute as your icon, i'll ask you out right now.

As for people's opinion on my weight, there's always plenty, whether I've been thin or fat.<br>  The best comeback is none at all.  Learn to be happy with who you are.  You can't do anything about your heighth, and acceptable weight is an ever changing subject.  Weigh what is comfortable on your frame.  You'll know if it's too much or too little.<br>  Learning to love yourself is the most effective way of dealing with people and their opinions. <br>  When someone makes a comment about your height or weight, look at them and smile, then shake your head ever so slightly.   You know you're ok just as you are, they're simply too blind to see it.<br>  God bless you.|`|e5df938f156d6be3bb105ddd037ebe44aa	1. You are just jealous that you are not like this. 2.

"Thank you for your opinion but, there is to much wrong with you for me to go off on now". Or " I'm sorry your so short i know it ruined your chances at being the model you always wanted to be." It's not my fault you don't like food, maybe you should join all of the real people in the world and eat more than a teaspoon of food".
1NHPK6u3aa	Ok. Now both are a little off but the second one sounds better. Either way you break it to her she still gonna be somewhat shocked. I previously had an experience similar to this. 1 of my former classmate informed me that he was diggin me in high school but he came off way to sexual and that is a BIG turn off. So why dont you try something like:<br>  "Hey how are you? Look I wanna apologize for staring at school the other but i was simply mesmerized by you beauty. And if you dont mind i would like to get to kno you better."<br>  Good luck!|`|AA10837421	neither... theyre both gay but if you have to choose one the second...but if any of my old guy friends or even anyone in general said that to me i would be grossed out and think there a ******...and not talk to them again
hp157lNmaa	it could be that her mom is really scared that she might follow the older sisters path...|`|8FbOtXAXaa	It just seems like she is the one being picked on because she is doing so well and it's possible that the mother herself is miserable  and looks at her daughter that is doing well and is adjusting well in life and is jealous. Trust me these things can happen. I know it sounds weird for a mother to be jealous of her own daughter but it happened to me. Not under all of these circumstances but we had different issues. The reason she doesn't pick on the other sis is because she is doing the exact same thing that her own mother is doing so she feels comfortable around her more than the other. She also might look at your girlfriend as though she seems like she is better than her by doing so well in life. Don't let her get down about it and let her know that she is a wonderful girl.

4Hcytibvaa	I think your husband is thinking about what is best for you and your child(ren).  Being around family is usually a more relaxing, more comforting form of living.  Being separated from your husband, having to deal with things all by yourself, is stressful.  Having the support of family will help.<br>  <br>  It will be an adjustment, and then there will be another when your husband returns.  Basically he will walk back in and you both will be expected to pick right back up.  You will have been the mother and father for a year, making all the decisions, making all the rules.  He will come back from having been around a bunch of guys seven days a week, and whatever pressures surrounded his assignment.<br>  <br>  So be prepared for that, even though it will be a joyous time, there will be a little discomfort on both parts.|`|QWZ13H07aa	I think it's a perfect idea. Many spouses of active duty military personnel don't have that opportunity and are so lonely during deployment. Family and support will surely help you, and it will comfort your husband to know you are in the best possible place while he serves his country.|`|YSeRV5zFaa	I stayed on Ft. Bliss when my husband deployed the first time and I am planning to stay on Ft. Carson when my husband deploys again next month. <br>  <br>  I'm not afraid to be alone, but if you are then do what's best for you. I would think that being on your own would teach you some independence.<br>  <br>  I go to college, work and also have twin 3 year old boys to keep me busy.|`|48bdlZQRaa	Very good idea.

My best friends husband is in the military and she does the same thing! Works great for her! Good Luck!|`|fMEypXDYaa	While alot of families have decided to stay near their husbands/wife's duty station while they are gone, some do leave to be near family like you said, either way is good, just depends on how you feel about all the moving back and forth. As for your sister, it would give you two some 'together' time and you could help her learn how life is out on her own. During Desert Storm alot of families moved away, during Iraqi Freedom they are tending to stay here.

wia9SXCPaa	I was in a similar situation and even though I don't think he was deserving of it or remorseful I forgave the man.  In my heart I felt a big sigh of relief.  Now I am not saying everything will go away over night, but it gives you some sense of peace.<br>  <br>  If you hold a grudge it will come back and your son will feel that at some point in his life.  You owe it to your son to deal with this now and put it in the past where it belongs.  Move on and make a great life for the two of you.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|bO2rzfISaa	You let go of the crap for your own sake. It's not letting him off the hook or condoning his behavior, it's allowing you to heal.|`|wpi36XBAaa	I don't think its him that you have trouble forgiving so much as much as you have trouble forgiving yourself for having made a bad pick to have as father for your child. Forgive yourself for being fooled into thinking that this man could be anything more than what he is - a dead beat dad, and move on with your life. We all make mistakes. If we accept that, learn from them, we can and should move on with our lives a better person.<br>  Live it not in hate and anger, nor in bitterness, but in joy for the sake of your child, and your own sanity.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	With time all this will become just a memory and you will be able to move past him. You still have ill feelings toward him because all that has happened is still fresh in your mind but yes, one day these feelings will diminish and disappear completely over time|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	You have to let go of it for your own sake.  It's not hurting him by hanging onto it... It's hurting YOU and you alone.  You're the one who is dealing with your anger and being hurt by it, not him.  Once you let of it, you'll feel a lot better and it'll be a lot healthier for you.  It has nothing at all to do with him anymore.  Good luck to you.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	when you grow up you will forgive him but won't forget it. forgiving is not about condoning him it's about getting on with your life, you two ae no longer together but yet he still is in control. try to let it go.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Those thoughts will go away.  Raising a son by yourself will take up most of your mental energy.  I should know... he left me when I was 3 months pregnant, haven't seen him since.<br>  <br>  Welcome to The World of Single Motherhood.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I advise you let go of the notion of "keeping him on the hook" or "holding him responsible".  When a man gets an abortion, there's nothing we can do.  A child support check will bring you no satisfaction when your son asks you why he doesn't have a daddy. It's just you and him now, until the end of time.  Take comfort in that.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	When you forgive someone, it's not for them. It's for you. Holding on to anger and bitterness will only make you angry and bitter. It won't hurt him a bit. It will have a constant negative effect on your life. I'm sure you don't want that for you or your son. So forgive and move on with your life. He hurt you once, don't let him continue to do it. Go be happy. That's the best revenge.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Forgive but do not forget!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	You are over thinking this situation. You know how many people are left alone to raise children by themselves? The numbers would make your head spin. This guy has to live with himself and the decision he has made. You should worry about you. Focus on the things in life that make you happy. Set goals for yourself and where you want to be in life. Forget about him. Be the better person. Raise your child the best way you know how. You don't have to forgive him, you don't owe him anything. But you do owe it to yourself to not let him ruin your daily life. Turn the page of life and move on.|`|af8f234413bbcf8b48334febf36e5cffaa	I feel like its wasting your energy on another person. It will be strange to him when your nice to him he won't understand. Always keep him at a distance b/c he doesn't deserve your friendship but don't waste your emotions on him when he's not worth it. You'll see you'll better as a person, seems like you want to overcome this bitter feeling towards him. He's in your life forever b/c of your baby, you don't have to like him just respect him as a person. I came to the states to live with my family and they treated me so unfairly but as time past. I became an adult and realized I don't need them and I'm responsible for my own feelings and emotions and I chose to forgive and be happy. I keep them at a distance b/c I don't anyone forgets the heartaches another causes them. So work on you. Don't worry about him too much.|`|chENztVEaa	In time your bad feelings will soften as long as you don't allow yourself to dwell on them all the time.  Don't allow yourself to stay worked up and angry all the time over him, he is not worth it.  Try to stay focused on the good things in your life and enjoy your child to the fullest.  He is the one who is missing out, not knowing his own son.  If he doesn't wish to see the child I know that will make you even more angry but think of it this way, he won't have the opportunity to set examples for your son that you may disagree with entirely.  I think it is harder on boys to be raised not knowing their father and should be if at all possible but at the same time if your son is not around him he won't be as apt to pick up his father's morals.  You have been through alot and you need time to adjust so I doubt what you are feeling is very abnormal.  Just stay focused on the two of you and your happiness and forget the looser.  You will eventually find someone you will love and who will in turn love you and your son.  Be patient.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well at least your son has a wonderful mother in his life I commend you for that.  You probably always will have these bitter feelings for your ex as you should he sounds like a total douche bag!! I know those hateful feelings go deep but feeling that way is not helping you to move on.  You don't ever have to forgive him cuz he doesn't deserve your forgiveness just put those feelings aside and forget about him totally as if he were gone off the face of the earth.  He doesn't even deserve you thinking about him at all even if it's not good thoughts. Just go on with your life and give your son a good happy life.

J77NbCXBaa	Be brave. I've asked out a guy before and I felt sooo good afterwards.  I would suggest you to start talking to him more often. Once you start talking more, then just ask him out to eat or something. Maybe you can study for class together. Just ask him to go get some food and discuss the readings.
5fPVU3jEaa	OK...listen very carefully, This is where i messed up.<br>  <br>  1. You've tried to contact him, he see's where you called. Let that be that.<br>  2. Dont try to call him again, let him call you. (maybe he's been busy too)<br>  3. If you go a week and dont hear from him, then you can call him and see what's up.<br>  4. Dont get psycho and call or text him a lot, that could drive him away.<br>  5. GOOD LUCK<br>  6. Stay strong, and keep your self busy.|`|pAPkdzrZaa	i dont know if hes playing you or not but im sure if he was he would have probably talked to you and stuff you know?<br>  are you sure its the right # though? that could be it. just text him tomorrow and say hey what are you up to or something :) and if he doesnt text you back then im sorry that he would do that but just let it be and when you see him again you can ask him about it.|`|gb7wNcVZaa	i would ask him-facetoface-why he isnt responding,<br>  but dont make yourself sound like a stalker.<br>  just asks whats up...or you can always call and leave a message.<br>  who knows why he is doing this.|`|jwwsAzYFaa	forget it|`|1nuknokbaa	do you think maybe he is a little embarrassed?

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	he hasn't got a chance, he may get shared parenting unless the judge feels he would pose a danger to the child. its good that u have documentation about his anger problem, and i am sure the judge Will take this into consideration.i would definitely make sure the courts knew about his anger, and if he is still showing anger. he doesn't have a chance to get full custody, and does he pay his child support? if not that will be a deciding factor also.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He's trying to scare you. Don't listen to a word he says.  You would have to be proven unfit or abusive before the courts would ever consider removing the child from your custody.<br>  <br>  He doesn't have any say in who comes into contact with her, nor does your medical condition preclude you from being a good parent.  Tell him to save his hot air for court.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Its pretty rare that the man gets custody when the mom wants it and only if the mom is proved unfit to be a parent.  His number one reason is ridiculous since it happens all the time.  He has a history of violence and it sounds like your parents will help you with the child.  I would say you have nothing to worry about, but of course I don't know all the details (like how serious your disability is).|`|TiaoTFecaa	Let me tell you your lawyer would be the best to answer this but im in the same situation and he can't keep the kid away just because you might have a guy but you both could say that the kid is not to be around different men only your husband or the wife|`|D3hYbsVJaa	More than likely he's not right. The state is probably going to side with you even though you left. He gets mad and pushes you? How much and why? I won't sit here and say it was easy to leave. I just wonder if you considered why he is that way at all, or if you just bolted from the the first time he threw a fit bc your mother go wind of it and started in on it. He is more than likely telling you this because he's hurt. He MAY be looking for ways to get you back. although since it's been since June, maybe not. And you can't admit what he's done by the way.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Him pushing you is irrelevant.  If he harmed the child, yes it's important, but in a custody case what he did to you means nothing.  Your seizures are definitely negative for your side.  A disability case shouldn't be your focus.  Getting your seizures controlled should be the focus of your attention.  There is nothing about having seizures that makes you disabled, as long as you treat them appropriately.  The judge will view your lack of treatment as the negative statement.  He will get at least joint custody, and has a good chance of getting sole custody if you don't do something about your medical condition.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	What a control freak!  He doesn't get to decide if she is raised around another man or not, she eventually will be, whether he likes it or not, you will move on.  He's not right.  I'm going through a divorce and he's so wrong, its funny.  They don't punish mothers and take their custody, because they are hurt, not working, or possibly because they will date others.  Who is he kidding?  Himself?|`|AA11206135	LOL he's just trying to scare you.. He can't stop you from getting married (I suppose if he had custody he'd never date or remarry??) and as long as you provide a roof over your daughters head he has no grounds to declare you unfit, especially with the family support you have....He's an *** and a bully and you have to tell your lawyer he has been harassing you... Make notes of every time he harasses or threatens you .|`|oJUGzFmiaa	the judge will always prefer for the mom to be the primary guardian unless he sees you as being a unfit mom. ex: drug abuse, prostitute, abusive, things like that, then he will consider the dad. he is just telling you that stuff to get you scared but don't be, be strong for your daughter and for your self. good luck and God Bless.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	in every state it is so hard to get the kids away from the mother i wouldnt worry all you can truly do is pray!! But if you are fit reguardless if you are working or not!! you have a medical condition so you are ok i am almost 98% sure!!! pray pray pray no matter what anyone says he's the only one that knows!!!|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	All these are really questions only your lawyer can answer with certainty.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Don't let him threaten you like this. You were never married, but even if you were, he couldn't forbid you from marrying someone else or having your daughter around that man. As long as you have a home with room for your daughter (even if it's your parent's home), you will be able to maintain joint custody of your daughter - at the very least.<br>  <br>  Because he has admitted violence against you AND he's threatening you, you may be able to get full custody and supervised visitation for him.<br>  <br>  I'm worried for your safety. Please consult your attorney about the threats this guy is making.|`|bmWKETgWaa	Some guys try for custody because they think that having the kid around their home will be cheaper than paying child support for years and years.  Usually they're depending on their girl friend picking up the work.  They're deluding themselves.<br>  <br>  I'd be worried that he will just pick up the little girl and take her away.  Since you were never married, you really need a lawyer in your corner.  State laws vary, and so do judges.  <br>  <br>  You'll be in a much stronger position if you can get your seizures under control, and not go on record as being permanently disabled until the custody issue is completely settled.|`|f06Sy0dfaa	However, in the event of a divorce dispute, it is up to a family law judge to determine child custody. Child custody laws vary from state to state, but a child's best interests will always be the primary factor in a judge's decision about child custody . <br>  <br>  Child custody typically involves physical custody issues and legal custody issues. Physical child custody refers to the physical right a parent has to be with the child and usually determines who will be the primary caretaker of the child. Legal child custody involves one or both parents' authority to determine matters relating to their child's welfare including healthcare, education, religion, activities, and other issues. <br>  <br>  A judge will grant child custody by considering the laws of your state, the parents or guardians, and the best interests of your child. Child custody may be awarded to one or both biological parents, grandparents, stepparents, or other possible legal guardians of the child. <br>  <br>  Many state laws reflect the notion that frequent contact with both parents following a divorce is in the best interests of the child (when abuse and other complications are not involved). A family court may favor granting parents joint custody , or the shared responsibility for the care, custody, and control of a child. In joint custody, both you and your spouse must discuss and decide on matters relating to your child's life. <br>  <br>  If the court finds one parent unfit to act as the primary caretaker of the child, a judge may find it in the child's best interest to grant sole custody to one parent. Sole custody would give the primary custodian the sole right and responsibility to make all major decisions pertaining to a child without having to discuss anything with the other parent. Sole custody may apply to physical and/or legal issues. <br>  <br>  In many cases, the family law court will grant one parent the primary custodial parent and the other will be granted child visitation rights. <br>  <br>  A judge will often consider the age of the child, the child's preference, financial matters, relationship between the child and parents, household stability, physical and mental wellbeing of the child and parents, evidence of abuse or neglect, and more when determining child custody. <br>  <br>  If you have children and are going through divorce, is essential to seek the help of an experienced divorce attorney who can help protect your legal rights and maximize your interests.

As long as she is taken care of let her alone she will be fine. But by all means stay in her life.|`|eiYVlVNNaa	You started your question with "he gets angry and pushed me: Now is trying to threaten or bully you with "he will not allow her to be raised or be around another man" He is a bully and a threatening bully at that. Don't listen to him and remind him it is not just his daughter she is yours also. Don't argue with him, I personally don't think you have anything to worry about unless you have been proven to be an unfit mother.  You made a very good choice in leaving him and also if you want to make life a little bit rougher for him get an order of protection that he is verbally and mentally abusive plus physically abusive|`|fIVzMoY8aa	He's trying to intimidate you.  Bottom line:  you've been taking care of her for a year just fine.  Whether you remarry, or live with another man, is TOTALLY irrelevant as to whether or not you get custody.  Finally, as long as you are seeking assistance and treatment for your disability, that should not preclude you from having custody of your daughter.  Again:  he seems to be perfectly OK with you having cared for her for the past year<br>  Good luck.<br>  Karen<br>  www.parkavenueguidetodivorce.typepad.c...|`|qXREuJYEaa	First of all alot depends on your state laws but he can't get custody because you aren't working especially when your on disability, if anything he will have to pay more child support & second some judges will not let u have overnight company (the opposite sex) until the marriage has taken place but totally up to that judge.<br>  Alot of states it's hard to take custody from the mother, he will have to prove you are unfit & nothing you have stated shows that. He could just be angry & trying to make you mad but he needs to chill before he's ordered to taken anger/parenting classes to help him in his time of need|`|tbpXdQeLaa	Dear Kristy...<br>   <br>  If may I  know..what kind of medical you take now? is that from depressed? <br>  <br>  From now on, you have to learn to stand up for your self. listen to your heart.control your self and try to think positif.

Et011ogJaa	What she said was very hurtful and mean...and I can understand why you feel the need to distance yourself from her.  The best thing you can do is forgive her and keep loving her...I am sure when she thinks about how unkind and hurtful she has been to you and others....she has pains of regret and waves of shame....I am sure she is not proud of herself for being out of control. The best way to get her to listen to you is to show true concern for her needs..but that does not mean you have to put up with her unkind behaviors. You have a right to set up boundaries to protect yourself from her emotional abuse. That is healthy. Also you show true love to your sister when you do not enable her bad behaviors in treating you bad.  I think your request for her to get some help is reasonable....but remember to do this with love in your heart for her...not for revenge or resentment.. She needs to know you love her and that your desire to have a healthy relationship with her is honest. Choosing to love and be the bigger person is not easy...but love never fails. I wish you the best.|`|bc2vMR5saa	Im really sorry to hear about that. I think your best option would be to tell her exactly what you feel. Tell her how much pain that she cause you by making that remark.(I could only imagine) Tell her that if she wants anything to do with you anymore that she needs to seek counseling. That was so wrong of her to say that and she should not throw a fit if things aren't her way. I bet she is jealous of you, your right so whatever you do don't let her bring you down. You know your above that. So my advice is sit her down tell her how it is and if she wont have it neither will you then.<br>  <br>  P.S Do not think in anyway that what she said was merely sisters fighting. That was so wrong of her to even metion that.|`|Gac30VHPaa	I think you two need to have a disscusion about how her argumentive statements have caused you harm. My sister and I have also recently faught and her statements became to personal and hard to swallow when I disscussed it with her...she understood but continues to be a bit moody and say rude things. I do not know weather or not your sister and mines may need medication sometimes it is just how their personalities are, which may need some fixing. As long as you keep mentioning to her the effect of her verbal assualts on you I think perhaps me and you will get some good results.|`|KlqoR276aa	hey..whoa datz a really messed up relationship u got there.anyway,i personally think that ur sis isn't sick or need help or whatever.It is merely sisters' fight.Like me n my lil sis,we always fight and make up.But the thing is we won't stop fighting.It'll be weird if we do.I suggest u have a one-on-one talk to her and u guyz can pour out everything.And both sides need to be really honest.Believe me,u'll be suprised by the answers u get out of her.Lucks..

JhvqUvlsaa	This happens unfortunately. I moved in September and neither of my Gfs from my old apt. complex email or call me (well they did once). So I'm making new friends here & online. <br>  <br>  So my advice would be to keep sending them "hi how are you" emails once in a while, but focus on your new school and making friends there; that way if you do break it off with them for good, at least you have some other friends to fall back on.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|Kq1zpgU5aa	I'm about to move away from my friends, and they've started disconnecting themselves from me.

Then again, you'll have to accept that this is human, as they may feel betrayed. I'm not a professor of physiology or anything, but of that I am certain.

RVLTubfYaa	Some people are just idiots...the things people do for two measly points. Anyway, I'LL answer your question. People like that-there is no talking to them. Whenever you feel/sense you are getting into an argument, end it then and there. No matter how mad or right you are, just cut her off and say "you know what? There is just no talking to you. No matter what I do/say, you will always think you are right. So I'm not arguing/discussing this anymore. I have my opinion, and you have yours." she'll maybe say "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!" and proceed to argue, but cut her off and say with a polite smile-"See? This is exactly what I mean." Tell her you'll see her later, and walk away. Kill em with kindness. When she sees you having the same argument with somebody else but in a reasonable way, that will hopefully inspire her to change the way she talks to people. good luck, because you're gonna need it: )|`|hGIi4mKlaa	I think its time for someone to get new friends....|`|mdE1HXMkaa	You and me would be terrible friends because you just described me.|`|h8a5MWlTaa	im right there with ya, when you get ur best answer, you should email it to me. but good luck. im in the same boat to the same place at the same time.

sGP6s7uraa	Instead of a unity candle or unity sand or unity wine/water, we're doing a "unity rock".  I read somewhere that an old Celtic tradition had the Bride and Groom say their vows while both joining hands and holding a stone together.  The phrase "setting it in stone" has apparently come from this tradtion.  I bought a really nice malachite stone and we will be holding this stone while we say our vows.  Now, whether or not this lore is true, I don't know, but we like it :)<br>  <br>  Another thing we are doing is having a non-traditional guest book.  Instead of the actual book, we're having decorated cardstock with a question on it for the guests to answer and then sign their name.  These will be placed at every table with pens.  Afterwards, my MOH will collect these cards and later I will bind them into a book.|`|Um3qrVrqaa	I would start with the ceremony. If you are doing it in a church, don't have a full out mass.

Gorgeous.  The chocolate looked like it was spilt coffee.  Then we also had chocolate coffee cups filled with mouse for another dessert.  <br>  <br>  We had the fancy tea cup as a centerpiece at each table.  Some of them contained coffee beans (which made the place smell GREAT) and a tealight candle.  Others had a little flower arrangement.  <br>  <br>  The favors were the coffee singles by folgers with a personalized sticker on them and a tulle bag filled with chocolate covered espresso beans.  <br>  <br>  The invitations had a black & white pic of a coffee cup with steam coming from it that formed a heart and there was a coffee cup charm attached to it.  <br>  <br>  Our first date was meeting for coffee and since that first date, we have went to the same coffee shop every sunday.  It became our ritual and a big part of us.  We even had our engagement pics taken at that coffee shop.  When we were there for the pictures, the coffee shop owner talked to us and he offered up two of his baristas, coffee and machines and provided our wedding reception with lattes, cappichinos, mochas, etc for free.  <br>  <br>  Our dinner menu was lasagna and manicotti (another traditional italian dish) since that was the first dinner I had ever made my husband.  I wasn't sure if he would like manicotti (he had never had it before) so I made a lasagna to go with it, just incase.  <br>  <br>  PS....I made everything myself (with the help of my great husband and great bridal team and mom).  I spent less than $5000 on my entire wedding, dress included.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Some different things I love seeing at weddings are fireworks, lavish meals that incorporate cultural or heritage ties, luxury favors (like gourmet chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champage and flutes in a wicker pacnic basket), live entertainment (bands or string quartets or a square-dance caller or line dance lessons available), fun transportation for the guests compliments of the bride and groom to and from the reception (trolley, school bus, whatever fits the couple), fruit flowers as decorations on the tables and/or buffet and desserts a flambe (bananas foster or cherries jubilee). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JCAgvgTxaa	<a href="http://offbeatbride.com/" rel="nofollow">http://offbeatbride.com/</a><br>  Go check out the archives and photos at <a href="http://offbeatbride.com/." rel="nofollow">http://offbeatbride.com/.</a><br>  You will find lots of good ideas there.|`|ACecbVghaa	Someone already said fireworks, but I agree, I love fireworks at weddings! Also, grand exits, like helicopters and horseback or buckboard are always great. I once went to a wedding where each guest recieved a silver spoon with his or her monogram on it, those were great favors, really out of the box and useful! We are having 2 meals at our reception, which I have been told is "different". Our wedding is at 11am so we are having a full sit down luncheon and then we are having a more casual dinner for the guests who want to stay. I once attended a "junk food" wedding reception, which was very different and not very classy but delicious. They had a pizza bar where you could make your own personal pizza, they offered every fried creation possible at a frying station (deep fried pickles, Oreos, Twinkies, etc). They had all finger-foods and bar food: mozzerella sticks, chicken fingers, wings, potato skins, ribs, chips, french fries, curly fries (fresh cut!). They did an ice cream sundae bar for dessert along with a large display of Hostess cakes, funnel cake, cotton candy and an entire display of pre-packaged individual candies. It was a junk fest, very creative and very unhealthy! But different...|`|TDPX04jtaa	well instead of the traditional church wedding and then hall reception or beach wedding why dont you get married in the forest. decorate the trees and bring in a canopy for you to stand under.  ive heard of ppl getting married at the zoo even. go with colors that ppl would not think to put together like orange and red or mango and hot pink or two shades of blue....instead of going fancy go fun and colorful.   have flowers that are differnt not just plain old roses or calillies...<br>  <a href="http://www.rareflora.com/unusual.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rareflora.com/unusual.html</a><br>  <br>  have games at the reception...and food from another nationality like jerk chicken or even do a bbq...<br>  <br>  i say the more color the more it will stand out|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	Everyting has be done so nothing is origional, make it yours, what are your colors, use them in unusual ways, like the toilet paper for the guest in the rest rooms!

Many ppl are into adventure sports etc. so they keep part of ceremony in say water( scuba) / air (skydiving etc.) <br>  <br>  Just be creative.|`|by9KuBizaa	If it's on a website, it's not creative and original as someone else has already thought of it and done it|`|7upShB9Yaa	I'm having a photo booth at my wedding reception. It serves 2 purposes. One for the guests wedding favors and two as the guestbook/scrapbook.<br>  <br>  When you go into the booth to take the 4 pictures it comes out with 2 sets of 4. The guests keep one set of 4 which will have something written at the top and bottom (such as our name and wedding date) and the other set of 4 is cut up however they like and glued onto a scrapbook page. Colored pens and stickers will be provided so the guests can decorate the page any way they want to and can write anything they want. Props are also provided if someone wants to do a set of funny pictures. They can go into the booth and take as many photos as they want. <br>  <br>  It's unique (at least to me it is) and I haven't seen or heard of it before. I think it will be something everyone remembers. I know I will. I don't know where you are located, but here is the site for the company I am using. It can at least give you some idea's if you are interested.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lonestarphotobooth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lonestarphotobooth.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!
OWhxWnVDaa	Ok here is a secret. I'm a women who is attracted to good looking men, the whole package and I usually don't let the other guy even get a word in.  You can go two ways, one being funny, there is nothing like a guy with a sense of humor....I love it.  The second is confidence. I know guys who are not cute at all but just have confidence and that's sexy. Don't worry or think about what women are thinking. That's going to hurt you. We can tell.  Maybe invite the girls to do something you like....that's diffrent. Like paintballing, driving range, fishing, skydiving lol.  Don't use flattery until you have confidence.b It will come off like your a sweet guy..women don't want sweet. Be polite and show manners open doors for all women not just your date.  I hate to say it but men who don't look like David Beckham do have to work harder.  But they have a tendency to have longer more meaningful lasting relationships. I hope I make sense IM of you need more help. |`|4qQ3a1UMaa	I hear over and over that women are NOT as worried about your looks as you might think, so don't worry about how you look so much because that isn't really the point.  It's confidence.  That's what everyone says but it's true.  You have to somehow pretend that you're not nervous about it, you know?  And it is extremely hard.  Maybe think of it as acting.  You're an actor and your role is a guy who is confident.|`|Tnj7CmW3aa	it is all about personality and confidence.  really you should be less worried about attracting women in general.|`|Z9XiSPrHaa	Buy her things!!!

Treat her like a women, <br>  <br>  I must add. I met this guy over a year ago. He was short ,small hands  ,very attractive face. He treated me so good and fell for him big time. I could care less if he was shorter then me. We just broke up i believe it had all to do with his insecurities about height. He always brought it up. And it wasn't an issue to me at all. So be confident don't let your insecurity get the best of you. just treat a girl right.<br>  |`|AvD10OU4aa	it has nothing to do with how you look i think that you just might not be their type or something im sure that it has nothin to do with your height i dated a guy who was like 5 ft. and i am like 5 5.

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	My dear, I am very sorry to have to tell you this, but your mother HAS picked drugs over you. What would help you cope with this is a support group for family members of addicts, like Al Anon. <br>  <br>  She's on drugs, and can't be normal until she gets off them. And she won't get off them until she wants to. And by the sound of it, she doesn't want to.<br>  <br>  Barry, sweet and all as he is, is not your responsibility. Don't go around there. If he cannot look after himself, that's not your problem. He's a grown man, and hopefully will have the commonsense to walk away from your mother. But again, it's not your problem, you don't need to concern yourself with it, so don't. You have enough to worry about already.<br>  <br>  Much better for you if you cut your mother out of your life completely, and if your grandparents do the same. Don't feel guilty about doing this, in fact you being there makes you an enabler of some kind, even if you don't give her money. So don't feed her, clothe her, do anything for her. If she has to cope on her own without you, there is the possibility that she will hit rock bottom a lot sooner, and this could force a change of some kind.<br>  <br>  You are great to try to love your mother despite her being so horrible to you, BUT - there is the martyrdom element of co-dependency there, and this you need to see in yourself, which is why I think you should find some kind of a support group. And don't say you wouldn't be able to survive if she picked drugs over you - she HAS picked drugs over you, and you HAVE survived it. And you will survive much more.|`|zWYfAWSOaa	I will answer your questions.<br>  <br>  why does she have to be like this?<br>  She is a an addict.  She has lost the power to choose.<br>  <br>  why does she nevr try to be normal?<br>  She is not normal. She cannot control herself.  She cannot keep her promises.  She will never be normal<br>  <br>  should i go round their and check on barry?<br>  Barry is a grown man, he can take care of himself.<br>  <br>  She will always pick drugs over you because she is an addict.  She is suffering from a compulsion and there is NOTHING you can do to help her or change the situation.  <br>  <br>  Here  is an analogy that helped me.  I had a teacup I liked. Nice size, shape and pattern. It had a crack in it. The tea would slowly seep out. on the table or on me.  I would get so mad.  But I kept using the teacup.  I would yell about the teacup and wish the teacup would stop leaking. My friends and even strangers advised me that I was going a little cuckoo to continue to get upset with the teacup, since it was clearly broken.  One day, I realized that I kept using a broken teacup and I was behaving insanely to keep hoping that it would change.  (Replace the word teacup with my parent and you'll understand what I mean).<br>  <br>  You didn't cause it, you can control it, you can't cure it.<br>  <br>  Of couse you can't cope. You are trying to make a 'normal' situation out of an insane one.  You need help. Lots of help, love and support.  <br>  <br>  Please go to Nar-anon. It is a no-cost support group for families of drug addicts. If there is not a Nar-anon meeting in your area go to Al-anon, it is a support group from families of alchoholics, but most of the same principles apply and most drug addicts are also alcoholics. <br>  <br>  If she is clean and sober for two years you could consider rebuilding a relationship with her, otherwise...<br>  Once an addict always and addict.<br>  <br>  I know what I'm talking about, I'm the child of an alcoholic and have benefited so much from Al-anon. There is so much help for you if you want it and are willing to seek it.  You can have a great life!|`|9f7da82548dac95c35d6ec34826ec681aa	Your mum isnt in control of her actions, the drugs are.  You're very lucky to have such wonderful grandparents who are there to take care of you, but they arent doing that if they are allowing your mum to speak to you like that.<br>  Your mum behaves like this because she's under the influence of drugs.<br>  She wont act normal untill she's not taking drugs<br>  No, you shouldnt go anywhere near her.  Barry is an adult and made an adult decision to stay with your mum.  <br>  Give yoursewlf a childhood and forget about her.|`|DbmLzow2aa	First of all, well done on getting this off your chest, stuff like this should never be kept bottled up. If you are scared for your or another persons well being, after her threats, then I'm sorry to say it but I really think you need to contact the police. I know you love her, but if she ever physically hurt someone close to you it could get worse. Have you two considered a councillor? To talk your problems out, it could really help. Theres must be a deeper problem then the ones on surface at the moment, and if you do everything you can, without putting yourself in any danger, to help her, then she'll know how much you care. Good luck.|`|PpYBnxgpaa	I really think you should let her go . I know it is hard as I am in the same basic situation as you . Good luck and you sound like a wonderful person|`|WpAtF0MCaa	wow i'm so sorry that must be hard. But have you ever tried talking to her just you two about all of it??? it seems like she defineately has some problems, some things I would say are just go live with barry or something aor try and get some kind of evst ncnt her to get better right?? I wish I oculd help you out a little bit mroe. email me if you want to at windex1991@yahoo.com tell me the other story.

u0udwkZQaa	She likes what she can't have. As soon as you stop paying her attention and someone else attention, she can easily feel attracted again. My advice, do nothing. Keep on getting on with whoever, and if she keeps trying to distract you tell her to dump this other guy and commit to you and you alone, or you're going to see other people and don't want to be with her. You've got the power now, don't give it away to her unless you get a decent deal. The worst thing you could do is pay her attention and she then goes off you and continues with this other dude.|`|mL07N3IAaa	well if u miss her and love her still, ask her out again! if not, just let her make small talk with you. then ignore her. you should just hang out with her best friend since you two are getting close and then ask her best friend to tag her along and not tell her that you're coming so she'll come too!|`|9bsYmkV3aa	She HAS a boyfriend and she's trying to get your attention?? wow...<br>  I think if she really wanted you back, then she would/should breakup with her boyfriend to show that she really wants to be with you. Or maybe she's evil and doesn't want her friend to be with you (Probably not.)<br>  If I were you, then I would just be friends with her-nothing personal or close. JUST FRIENDS. From what I can see, you still have feelings for her? But when she broke up with you, she didn't want you to be near her. If she wants to be with you again, let her make the move. (Or you can. But if she says no...it's not the end of the world)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3X7hF6ssaa	I would ask her straight up, why she is acting like that, it would only make it worse by ignoring it and letting it happen.|`|KRCJXKoaaa	Just try not to let it bother you.<br>  She's trying to get you to pay attention to her, so just ignore her and go on with your daily life.|`|PK5Elowdaa	make her regret she ever dumped you. Keep pretending like you're ignoring her and keep messing around with her friend. She'll go crazy and wish you were back with her.|`|sQmGxWn0aa	Props my friend for figuring out one of the best ways to get a girls attention:  make her jelous through her friends. If I understand correctly, you're trying to get her back? If so then you're getting her attention most deffinitely. The thing you have to ask yourself, however, is this : does she want me now because she thinks I'm no longer hers and am into her friends or because she truely likes me and wants me back? Us girls are weird, we always want what we don't think we can have. So say your X decdides that she's deffinitely into you and you guys get back, the thrill of the chase is over for her; who knows if there will be  any chemistry left?  That's just my 2 cents , hope it helps!!
2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Think about things you have "always wanted to do". Like, when you were a kid - was there anything that you thought was "cool"? I read the Three Musketeers in 6th grade, and ever since I've been wanting to learn fencing; so a few years ago it occurred to me - why not take a fencing class? One thing led to another, I did sports fencing for a little while, and then I got involved in a historical fencing/swordfighting school and got to learn rapier, sidesword and longsword techniques. It was a blast, I met lots of new friends. <br>  <br>  Another thing that has been on my list for a while was learning to make pottery; I took a ceramics class last semester, although I had to drop it mid-semester because of some health issues. Maybe in the future I can pick it up again, it was really fun.<br>  <br>  Yet another interest of mine is Ancient Egypt, and for a while I was an ARCE member and went to lectures etc. At one point, I was also a member of the local tropical fish club (I keep a fish tank).<br>  <br>  Truthfully, most of the time my routine is exactly that  - "come home from work and hang out with hubby"; day in and day out, I don't do anything that keeps me busy. And most things we do end up doing, we do together. We got an RV, and have been taking short RV trips. We have friends over for dinner. We go out to eat. We watch our fav. TV shows. We really don't mind the routine. I love to cook, so I make dinner almost every night. Very often, he's busy with work in the evenings, so I read or play a videogame (I got hooked on WoW a few years back). I don't do nearly as much stuff as I used to when I was single, and it suits me just fine.<br>  <br>  Other things that can keep you busy (depending on your inclinations) are pets, learning foreign language, volunteering for a cause, training for a marathon, playing a sport, gardening, crafts.|`|BlVudiyfaa	volunteer|`|LVpyaf48aa	take a photography class. learn to take pics like a pro and pretty soon you will be in demand for all sorts of fun events. its also something that can be used for a lifetime. imagine the jealousy and envy of other parents when your (future) kids always look fabulous in photos and all they have are really bad snapshots! lol.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	i just go to my girlfriends house and watch movies. at least you are out of the house and it doesn't cost money.<br>  <br>  shopping, that's always fun<br>  <br>  go to a hookah bar :)<br>  <br>  get a massage/tanning<br>  <br>  maybe you and your hubby can go out together. maybe meet some friends to all hang out with. its different hanging out with your spouse when you're actually "out". you know what i mean?|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Take a pottery/ceramics class at the local community college.  So much fun!  Also make dates with your girlfriends to go just out and have drinks and a movie or to a concert.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	If you have a college close by, call them up and ask for a catalog of continuing or adult education classes. I've gotten addicted to these! (hubby works out of town for the summers) They have things like gardening, photography, scrapbooking, tennis, and pretty much anything under the sun you want to learn about. I'm enrolledin a French class for this summer I'm stoked about. <br>  <br>  If you like to read, do a book club with your girlfriends once every week or 2. You can do easy fun reads like Twilight and stuff. I did this with girlfriends and then we went and saw the movie together. Or, if there are hobbies you share with friends, get together and do those. I love to make wreaths for my front doors, and I have a really crafty girlfriend so we get together and go to JoAnn's then make wreaths and watch Friends reruns and chat. It's fun. <br>  <br>  If you're into sports, you could join a tennis or soccer or running league. I have a tennis league i'm pretty into that's fun. <br>  <br>  Pretty much they sky's the limit! And never underestimate the importance of girl's night, even if it's just out for dessert or drinks for a couple hours!|`|ZEitfScGaa	Why don't you and your husband find activities that you can do together, rather than just sit around at home.

RtrxmSNdaa	it's true and i should know cause it happed to me b4^^ for a guy to like you you have to put more details to actually know<br>  <br>  --like does he stare at you? alot--<br>  --he tries to touch you--<br>  --notice you in a big crowd--<br>  --shows off--<br>  --talks about you a lot--<br>  <br>  why not ask your friend to see what is up between them and if there's nothing going on then ask her if she can help you out since they have a lot of classes together
u0udwkZQaa	There are lots of pretty girls that choose to stay single for a while, they are picky, and they have every right to be. Hope gets more visible as you get older, when guys start to mature a bit. You could always go for an older guy? From my experience of being a guy, most guys don't mature to the level that they are looking for more than sex till they hit their early 20's. They're still horny, hey, who isn't? But the point is it doesn't control them so much and it's not everything. Keep on doing what you're doing, they'll come to you and you'll know when they're ready for the picking.|`|qPd5G3dSaa	your 16, of course guys that age are going to be immature.... thats why toy should mingle with different crounds... they will start to buck up around 17-20, give it time...|`|4m3z1ztEaa	because they are 16....doh!<br>  if you really do want find nice ones, go to the top classes of your high school<br>  people who are the tops of high school classes are generally more responsible and practical<br>  you will have a higher chance of finding a good one|`|mdE1HXMkaa	There is definately a lot of hope.

Save your relationship and get your own place.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Since you are 24 and back living there I guess you are paying some sort of rent??  Just tell her that she doesn't need to cook for you that you will take care of your own meals.  You are not a teenager and just because you live ther doens't mean you have to be home and eat what she cooks.  You both need to discuss rules, etc. with each other because you are no longer a child however living under her roof.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	So why couldn't you tell your mother what you DO like to eat. You are living in her home, humor her for christs sake. Or move out.

Point out the benefits- its a smaller grocery bill for her, and she can cook what she wants when she wants. |`|R8fEO8tUaa	tell her the foods you dont like, and make sure that she knows that u dont expect her to avoid those foods, just tell her not to make a protion 4 u when shes cooking them<br>  <br>  |`|yhJOMfFOaa	It probably hurts her feelings you don't like her cooking. Just tell her you are not hungry and will eat some later. I know that when I cook I try to please every one. but some times you can't. May be you should tell her what you do like,if any .of the things she does cook. Any way that is a stupid thing for a mom and daughter to fight over.  Get you a dog for under the table and let it eat the food she cooks, will make the dog happy and fat, and will make your mom feel appreciated. <br>  Wish I had my mom to cook for me, she died and I miss her so much, I wouldn't fight over such a thing as her trying to do for you. <br>  |`|Kc998uljaa	Maybe you could tell her you want to share the responsibility and that on certain nights you'll make the meals... tell her she deserves a break now and then,she may love the idea.. :-)|`|AA11414777	My advice is to sit down and talk with your mother and explain that while you appreciate all the care and love she puts into making meals for you, you really feel that as an adult you should be responsible for preparing your own meals.  You can either eat out or fix your own meals.  Please make sure you consider her feelings when doing this and don't carry out your talk in anger.  You say you do not like to cook so suit yourself when it comes to meals.  As a mother, I spend countless hours trying to think up meals my 22 year old daughter will eat and usually end up frustrated because she is either dieting or has decided she is cutting out certain foods.  I would love for her to tell me that she would be responsible for taking over her dietary needs.  
AA11662302	No one is perfect. We all make mistakes. The wonderful thing about God is He forgives us if we are truly sorry and we continue to do our best to not let it happen again. The fact that you feel guilty is a good sign. It means you still have a conscience. When the urge comes over you to masturbate and/or look at porn, then pray to God for strength. Do something to take your mind off of it. You could read the Bible. Read accounts of people who have endured temptations and over came them with God's help. And remind yourself of the guilt that you feel after wards. The pleasure only lasts for a moment, but the guilt lasts allot longer. If you want to talk about it, I could direct you to a website with lots of Bible based articles that could help you out in this, and lots of other situations.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	1) porn is not for minors<br>  2) a 15 yr old should not be having any kind of sexual discussions with strangers on the internet. it is for your protection.|`|9701f5a04b0788301d3119e00ccedc0aaa	1. no<br>  2.not really<br>  3.no, horny<br>  4. yea, lucky<br>  5. have fun don't feel guilty.|`|hL4nWbzmaa	How to avoid porn addiction on the Internet<br>  <br>  1. Consider installing porn content filtering software( Strongly Recommend NetDog ,you can get it from www.netdogsoft.com ) on your computer. it will help to protect you from stumbling into pornography by accident, That's important.<br>  <br>  2. Do not try to guess what the address of a Web page is. Many pornographic sites have similar addresses of respectable sites. For example www . whitehouse . com is a porn site. The real address is www. whitehouse . gov<br>  <br>  3. Never click on Web site addresses that you receive in an unsolicited email.<br>  <br>  4. Do not open attachments that come in email that are unsolicited.<br>  <br>  5. Use filtered search engines or reputable directories to find the information you need.<br>  <br>  6. Do not search for terms like girls. Think before you enter a search term.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stick with reputable sites.<br>  If something looks questionable, don't let curiosity get the best of you.

Lusting after someone you're not married to (as in porn) is the same as adultery in God's eyes. So yes, what you're doing is totally wrong.<br>  <br>  Repent of your sin, stop doing it, and trust that Jesus paid for your sins with His death on the cross. Then live a new, different life. God can do and regularly does miracles in our lives that enable hopeless people to feel hope again and lost people to become found.<br>  <br>  God's grace is greater than our sin. Turn to Him and learn all you can by reading the Bible.

iwvRBeXOaa	Well think of it this way-you have a bunch of girl FRIENDS who are telling you you have confidence issues. This means you have a bunch of friends who are girls that are not sexually attracted to you. They see you as a friend and that is probably because you come off sappy and too sweet. Girls like a guy who is confident, takes charge and seems to have a lot going on in his life.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Tell them to blow you.

Just tell her what you think is going on and if she doesn't do anything about it, then you should. I really hope you get out of this situation and I hope you and your family will be okay. Hope I helped youy and sorry if I sound harsh or anything it's just what i think.

wXaGIPSPaa	I think your email response may be from your heart and how you are thinking but it sounds like you are preaching or that you think you are right and he is not and that you are the victim in all this. If I were reading it it would tick me off at you and make me not want to talk to you at all about this.  <br>  I think what you need is a third person to referee. It can be a therapist or someone who is not on either of you's side.  But it needs to be someone that understands communicating in such a way not to start arguements of put defences up.  For ex you never put the word you in the sentence.  The end of your email says "whats more important being right or being happy" yet it gives the impression you need to tell him you are the one that is right.  <br>  Forgiveness and restoring trust can take years. It requires patience and alot o fextra work. You have to convince the person every single day you are truly sorry by telling them and telling them why.   <br>  well, good luck hon. This is not over, its fixable but I think you need some outside help.   Good luck.
Xmq8o3nhaa	Don't worry, he's nervous, he thinks you are going to ask him out. Boys aren't like girls, but if you go and ask him if he will go to starbucks with you, I bet he'll say yes.|`|AA11555112	You have to try to talk to him. You might feel queasy and stuff, but it's better to know the truth, right? Doubts just stand in your way, you have to trust yourself. Maybe write him a note if you're scared to go face-to-face with him? Sometimes what other people say ruins everything, believe me, I have experience. It's very annoying to fret about how he might feel about you, but you have to try to know the truth, than to be in the dark. No matter what the outcome might be, you have to have confidence. Breaking down won't solve anything, so talk to him, ask him. If the answer you get is unsatisfactory, don't give up. There are probably better guys then if this guy doesn't like you. Maybe he's just not meant for you. (I'm sorry if I got down your hopes...) If the answer you get is satisfactory, I wish you good luck in the future :)|`|0XLASb9vaa	just talk to him<br>  you'll figure it out soon enuff<br>  be bold!|`|1ED8peqLaa	just talk to him and remeber be your self|`|6fbCHfU9aa	Just TALK TO HIM IMA BOY MAKE UP SOMETHIN TO TALK ABOUT THAT IS KOOL|`|9Vz6kPKRaa	play it cool, dont stress<br>  have a casual conversation w/ him<br>  that'll explain alot|`|HgN1oZ0yaa	you should talk to him online or text him and say that you don't like him but you would like him if he liked you and build up your friendly relationship again or watever and then become gf and bf but if that doesn't work screw boys, you don't need them. ;]

JYgJD0Rwaa	Its quite possible he is addicted to the drugs and drinking. If he says he wants to stop, and told you he would but still hasn't, he may need aggressive treatment and help to stop.<br>  You married for better, for worse...sickness & health. You need to stand beside him through this. I agree, your kids don't need to see it, so you should separate to protect the kids, but still support him through this so that you two can get your life back together.|`|AA10911598	Put the kids needs up front in this situation.  They do not need to be involved with illegal behavior.  He could end up in jail if he continues this drug usage.  I would take some time apart to let him work on cleaning up his life before you make up your mind.  Give him a set amount of time to repair this problem.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, he wants to work it out! But that seldom happens. He will not be able to do this on his own. Having counseled alcoholics for many years, I would recommend that your husband attends AA meeting. Yes, drinking and substance abuse has to do with the inability to deal with life's problems. But there is little you can do to solve his problems. Once he learns to express them at AA, that is the time that you can help him deal with them.<br>  <br>  Altogether this is a tough road ahead of you. You can also check out my source and find some reference to alcoholism and substance abuse.|`|Yby3loNEaa	well my ex was that way, i knew he drank but i didn't want him to do blow so i told him that i was going to leave him if he ever did it. welll i was hearing things like he was trying to get with girls i even lost a good friend because of him, because i believed what he said over her. but it came down to when a friend told me he was doing it, so i confronted him and he lied and all of his friends told me that he had sex with this fat nasty girl, i had a enough with it so i left him. sorry but i know a lot of crack heads(i'm not one learned by seeing it) and they will never pass it up they will alway do it good luck and think of your kids they are what is important, not some loser that is going anywere|`|AA12060117	It sounds like he needs to have professional help.  I would seek out help from a therapist, and get someone on the professional level to help you out.  Don't try to blame yourself or try to handle this on your own.  You can help him get through this.  If he refuses to get help, then you need to think about your safety and the safety of your children first!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Get him to go to counseling, both alone, and with you. Don't bail on him yet.|`|AA11319441	Cocaine is a hard drug, and can kill.  Most rational people can agree on that.  I say that since you have children, SHAME ON YOU if you stay.  Just the fact that you have doubts makes me think you are selfish.  Because you know that your BF is an addict, yet you do nothing to protect your children.

rCiDBdfRaa	Ask him yourself, he sits right next to you in class lol.  Plus you already went out with him, so this wouldn't be your first time down that road with him.
lI0UsOpyaa	i think this is no longer in your hands. she needs some time to think things over it looks like, and set her feelings straight. in a little while she will start to become comfortable around again most likely, but dont rush it. she just needs some space to figure herself out. girls are complicated, i know, but ive got 17 years of experience being one, and it sounds to me like she is just a little confused or feels a little akward about the whole thing right now. time will fix this, i wouldnt worry a bit. good luck and god bless! =]|`|owewXHB0aa	well she shy wat else do you think she needs some time to adjust give it time|`|x7rv7MH1aa	she's shy and she just needs to get used to the fact that you like her...nfeels kinda awkward bout it.but she'll adjust|`|09EWvJs0aa	Take it from a shy person. She's probably scared and embarassed. and if her and her boyfriend are close then she is probably avoiding u because she doesn't want to mess things up with him. If her boyfriend is the jelous type (like me) and he finds out that you like her and that you and her were talking he would probably get very jelous and probably mad at you. She also might be trying to protect you for that same reason (her not wanting him to get mad at you).|`|SZvJVM2yaa	don't waste your time on her your weak you will fall in love quick n if u do and she leaves him for  you hahah sorry to say she will leave you for some one else women are like that just play on playa|`|HHniTZTbaa	dudee she sounds like she wants her boyfriend she has currently. and is confused by all this. she might want to be friends or just not talk to you. don't try and talk to her too much, no offence but it's annoying when a guy you don't want to talk to/don't know how you feel about talks to you. just let it cool off. good luck (:|`|w6r4U7duaa	Well having been in her situation, and the shy type around guys I like, I can tell you She wants her bf. You are interfering unfortunatly. I dont mean to be mean. <br>  When some one is in a relationship, you need to respect that. It was very selfish of you to say that to her.<br>  Now you'll be lucky if she likes you and leaves him for you. but i would not count on it if she is a decent type of girl. <br>  <br>  I beleive she is embarassed, confused, trying to be loyal to her bf by not talking to you. My advice, leave her alone, let her come to you if she wants you. <br>  Otherwise she could have told you "I am breaking up with my bf" at some stage, and she would still be talking to you now! <br>  <br>  Personally I wouldnt a trust a guy like you who is self centered, one day another guy will swipe your gf from under your nose. How will you feel about that!<br>  True signs if she likes you: She will look at you, smile then look away quickly if she looks down at her feet she likes you, touch you when you talk, giggle, toss her hair, <br>  However if she rolls her eyes at you, she dont like you. If she looks up at you with steel eyes, she hates your guts. <br>  <br>  Take care anyways, and next time try just being nice, and just being there for a her. Be approachable/available cause What goes around certainly does come around x3!|`|mVJVUxSzaa	I think she saw someone she could really be friends with and you messed her up a little by expressing feelings that go beyond friendship. She may be the type of girl who wouldn't even think of cheating on her boyfriend and you knowing she has a boyfriend, probably made her feel a little like she didn't know if she could trust you. Apologize and if possible assure her that you will respect her and truly be a friend.|`|aT6D4FApaa	i don't think this has anything to do w/you...i think she feels like she's being unfaithful or something to her bf by talking to u especially since she knows you like her...and maybe she likes you back & feels wrong about it? either way she has a bf and is not available. sorry but u may have to move on.|`|sRjNWi3Yaa	she a little confused give her some time shell come around she still like u trust me,she does no how 2 talk 2 you yet cuz she does really want 2 feel played if she say the wrong thing to u|`|oRJOihzwaa	She will talk to you
AA11909552	Your friends probably do not know him. Do not let them stop you from talking to him. Do not worry about what they think. Just talk to him
7MJSPGnhaa	Well if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...<br>  <br>  you know where I am going.<br>  <br>  EDIT: really you're a wife and a mom now?  Have any daughters?  How would you feel if your 20 year old daughter came to you and told you she'd had sex with 40 men?  It's not jealously honey trust me.  I didn't feel the need to pass myself around like a football to every man I met to make myself feel better.  That being said no man has a right to touch you without your permission.  Regardless if your "friends" told your little secret to the boss he is a grown man and should never put his hands on you.<br>  <br>  Oh and one more thing, how much DID you tip the massage therapist?|`|kbz5S3waaa	so, is it like throwing a hot dog down a hallway now?<br>  <br>  that's a lot my friend, it really is, but I'm not here to judge you, merely crack a joke and answer your question. I've been with 1 person, and that's my husband.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  come on now, get serious, you're putting yourself out there like that, and now taking it personally. You asked, we told. Good for you that you're happily married and 'good in bed.' You can't tell me that you'll think it's perfectly acceptable for your children to grow up and sleep with around 40 other people? Your morals are obviously loose, among other things... Now for the people at work, go to HR and call sexual harassment and quit whining.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	From a male perspective I wouldn't use the term slut. But easy. But its in your past we all make mistakes. I wouldn't let it get you down.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	To be honest that really is alot, but hey it's always someone out there worst than you.I don't think your a slut, maybe only if you weren't in relationships with these guys,if it was 1 night stands or prostitution..but who am i too judge you? and who are they?<br>  men do it all the time..and they are consider players,but women are consider whores, just keep your personally business to yourself because people are going to judge you weather you like it or not.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Maybe you did this when you were younger and didn't think much about it and I don't think it's unusual to sleep around then. It's over and in the past so forget about it and maybe it's best to not answer the question if the responses are going to bother you. <br>  <br>  There's a lot of self righteous people out here ready to jump on this kind of information. It makes them feel good to talk down to you or shame you. Let it go it doesn't matter anymore. What's in the past needs to stay there.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Hmmm...oh well, your man accepted you for the sl*t that you are and thats all that matters now....next time dont count the men youve slep with but the times you've had sex...try keeping count of that! lol|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You ask people to tell you how many men they had slept with. That question is so personal and private I wouldn't even say on this anonymous format. If someone had the nerve to ask me that I would ask them why they would ask such a rude question. I did told  my husband before we married because we decided to have no secrets to come back and bite us in the butt. As for giving that information to a group off women sitting around a lunch table......none of their business. Just because someone asks a question does not mean you have to answer.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	Nooo!! not at all. i dont realize why people think that if woman sleeps with more than a few people they are 'easy'. if you were sexually active for 15 years (15-30) that would mean that you slept with 2-3 people a year! As long as you feel confident in yourself, had a good and safe time, and are in a happy relatipnship now, who cares what they think. They are probably bummed out they waited til marriage and found out their husband has a little one and is bad in bed.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I don't think that's alot. Personally Im not a slut and got married younger at 20 yrs old. Im not about to air how many men Ive been with but I never see the point in counting them like a accomplishment. As long as you know you wasn't a slut that is all that matters.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You may not be loose now, at least I hope not, but it sure sounds like you ran through a good number in your heyday. Im a guy and Ive been with 8 women, some romantically, some just physically. If it bothers you hat much, don;t bring it up to co-workers, you need to get some harassment complaints going.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Maybe it is a high number,but, what if a guy had said that number with the boys? You know his a$$ would be getting high fives and looks of pure jealousy. As I just posted an answer to another question, I wished I had been able to tell my husband that I had been with more.<br>  <br>  Purple, stop that!|`|C4bxnKDXaa	No std's...then you are good. if it led you to the love of your life and you leanred...then this is how you had to do it. Do I think its high, yes. I have been with 6 and I am 32. <br>  <br>  But wow...so girls have the same conversations as guys do! Thats awesome!|`|y9CgveCGaa	I'll be honest.  As a guy that sounds like an awful high number.  Mine isn't that high.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	yes!<br>  <br>  sorry but true.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	girl your past is in the past. you are who you are now. who cares what they think. Your husband married you  and is happy with you. don't let their opinions of you determine who you are. I married young too and havn't been with many men, but I think that it's your business not theirs. we all mess up, they shouldn't judge you, they know they have skeletons in their closet too.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I hate to say anyone is a slut, i think it is disrespectful. I do think that is a lot but as long as your comfortable with it who cares what other people think. I am not really wanting to give a exact number here but it is less than 15, i feel like my number is a little higher then i would have liked but we all make chocies  and unfortuetly i made a few bad ones. I learned from my mistakes though and im in love wit ha wonderful man and have been for 6 years now.|`|Z2YgGifCaa	That is a matter of your own opinion as everyone is different and nobody should live by the guidelines of others because what works for one person, won't always work for everyone else.<br>  <br>  Remember, it's not how others see you, but how you see yourself!|`|xGshAiXOaa	Atleast you still know a ballpark figure for yours.  I know women who have lost count.  Personally, I have had sex with one man, my husband.  I don't think that makes me any better or worse than you.  People make different choices, and some people see sex as more casual than others.  I don't judge until it gets into the 100's.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	A slut is someone with very low standards and will have sex with just about anyone. You were a person who enjoyed sex with multiple partners. And you were probably more selective about who those partners were. In that case you would not have been a slut. And even if you were, why does it matter now?|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	That's an awful lot of people.  I'm glad you got it out of you system, what does you spouse say over your numbers?  I bet you beat his numbers.  Married young or not you've been around the block a couple of times.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	I've slept with about that many myself. I don't really care about how anyone feels about it and neither should you.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I bet all these women in here have had sex with at least double what they admit to. People love to point fingers.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	Sometimes being silent through a conversation such as this is best.  This was one of those times.  You may not be a slut but you need to exercise grace and decorum.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I think 40 is above average, but if you feel no regrets, don't let their opinion affect yours now. You're happy with how your life has turned out and ultimately that's all that matters..|`|5hxWSezPaa	Sounds pretty slutty to me.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	In the future if you must put a number out say a little white lie <br>  "a dozen"|`|KWYOetbiaa	wowww very disgusting, ewwwwwww, and ur husband was ok with the idea of marrying a woman with such antecedents?|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	40 is quite a few...sorry but if you are ok with it and your husband obviusly was ok with it, who cares?|`|r5wK05N5aa	Wanna make it 41?!|`|djUMvICoaa	Sampling is O.K., but there's the difference between the one because it is a relationship and what seems like one night stands.   That's why most will look at it as being slutty.  If you were a guy you would be the envy of the lockerroom.  Next time I would lie about it and cut the number in half.  That way they know you had a good sex life without looking like a slut.  While men could have bragged about a number like that at one time, I think even that is changing, that people are seeing it as not healthy especially with the STD's out there.  So while our norms are changing, there is always going to be room outside of them for you.. It's what you're doing right now that counts the most.|`|krQiDGCHaa	It's more than average I think, but who cares?  What does it matter if people think you're a slut?<br>  <br>  You were young, you had a good time, then you settled down and got married.  Big deal.<br>  <br>  I've honestly slept with more people than I'm proud of as well, but when I met my now-husband, I decided to settle down and I have been 100% faithful to him -- that's all that matters at this point.  Who cares how many people I was with before I even met him?  It's none of anyone's busines! :)<br>  <br>  As long as you don't regret it, hold your head high and brag to yourself that you're more experienced and therefore probably a better lay for your husband than those woman are for theirs.  Ha Ha! ;)|`|nMhbzKuJaa	The short answer is, it depends. If these were relationships with men you cared about over the course of many years, than no. If they were one night stands and random hook-ups with people you never saw again or cared for at all, than yeah kind of. I guess I'm just really picky, not sure that I could find 40 men that I'd want to be intimate with.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if they were young when they got married, some people just want the special bond that sex brings with their husband only.|`|RfKAIPscaa	How old are you?  Let's say for the sake of arguement that you've been sexually active for 10 years?  That's 4 different sexual partners a year...that means every 3 months you were laying down with a different man.  <br>  <br>  I'm not one for calling names but you have to ask yourself why a woman with any self respect would not alone sleep with 40 different men but would also want to tip a massage therapist for jacking her husband off?!!|`|nXzvE0P8aa	I honestly don't think that what you did in your past is anything to be ashamed of. Some people have one and some people have 200-400.  I have met people with a list of 400 people and they are still great people to me.  We all have skeletons in our closet and having a list of sexual partners does not make you a slut.  I see it as your just more experienced and Im sure your husband is happy that you don't lack in that department.  Hold your head up high and as long as your husband loves you and accepts you who cares what everyone else thinks.  You have to be happy with who you are and our past is what makes us who we are today.  Ignore some of the rude comments people leave you, unfortunately you will never make everyone in the world happy.|`|vcZZvtXAaa	Real women do not discuss things of this nature. My mom always said there are 3 things you do not discuss with people other than your spouse. Sex, Finances, Politics. All of these are heated topics, these are private matters. The fact that you are so comfortable with letting the world know how many people you sleep with is what makes you a S**t not the number of people you sleep with. Ladies never tell

c301808cefefe9bba562d7c541766c4faa	She's his crush, but she's not interested.<br>  <br>  Let's look at this from Bob's point of view, shall we?<br>  Bob wants her attention, wants her to love him, wants her to look up to him as her man, so he's not going to do anything to offend her. In fact, to prove he's dedicated to her he'll go out of his way to be her best friend. On the other hand, your friend doesn't owe it to Bob to not date other men.  She can't treat Bob like he's a BFF!  What's she going to do, tell him about the great sex she had with some other dude she met? He'd resent the hell out of that.  From his point of view, it's a stab in the chest and a twist of the blade. Your friend and bob don't have a relationship worth saving, imo.  Let him have Betty. He deserves to give his attention to someone who can appreciate it.

I dont think your truley in love, your just in love with the idea of love.  Understand.  You still have feelings for him, just not that strongly|`|C3AW54Eeaa	Your so young, ur not wanting a very serious relationship.It feels so great to really like someone but the second they take it to another level (like love) it then becomes different, u dont look at him the same like before.the best part of a relationship is spending time with someone and always in the back of ur mind wonder how he REALLY feels about u but the minute he puts it all out on the table it takes the excitement out of the relationship. follow ur heart, u THINK u love him, when u really love someone u actually have feelings of wanting to spend the REST of ur life with them not the opposite, its not love, ur just not really wanting this deep of a relationship with him so maybe tell him ur not ready for this and maybe he will back off or u just tell him u want to walk away while u still care for him and maybe later down the line u will feel different but right now its not right for u. If he really cares for u the way he says then he will understand and back off. Good luck!!
AA11363680	Quite honestly, who cares? Stretch marks are not an issue.<br>  <br>  If everything else in the relationship is good, it's doubtful they'd even be noticed most of the time.

He needs to be able to be comfortable with her dynamic character. He should make maker laugh and laugh with her whenever she makes jokes. They will be considered as a "fun" couple to be around with because they have high spirits and they would be making fun of each other (purely for fun and laughs). Just like any ideal type of guy, he needs to be faithful, supportive, and he needs to respect your best friend. He is someone who is strong and can resist any temptations that other girls might bring to him. They should have similar interests. If your best friend loves chick flicks, then he needs to be able to handle one or two of them with her. He is someone who has aspiring future; he knows the general direction of where he wants to go and what he wants to do in life. He's committed and loves to help others, perhaps by volunteering.<br>  <br>  In the end, your best friend will decide if he's the right one or not. We are in no position to decide that for her. Give her my regards.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|UjajMHH4aa	i don't think there is a right type of person for anyone. <br>  I was always attracted to the"bad boy" and those relationships always ended badly. When i met my most recent boyfriend i was in primary school and i never would have thought of him as my type. He was sort of dorky when we were younger, but then we started hanging out a lot more last year and when he asked me out for like the millionth time i said yes and i was so happy. we arent together anymore only cos of various other reasons, but he was the most unlikley person i thought i would be happy with, yet he made me the happiest out of everyone.<br>  <br>  You don't necessarily need to find someone right for her, but encourage her to get out there and look because its always in the most unlikely of places and she's never going to find him if she's not looking.|`|XgYg5BB3aa	Your description of her sounds quite similar to myself, actually :P <br>  I think she's fare well with a guy who's got a good sense of humour (probably a little sarcastic) and who might come off as a bit serious or shy himself... that way, she'll have someone who can laugh at her silliness but she can still feel comfortable around :)
fewTLrhAaa	To be honest most of the guys i know are in one way or another.<br>  There's still some of us good guy's about, were just harder to find!<br>  Sometimes You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince!|`|81RyFQTYaa	WHY DO YOU ASK SUCH QUESTIONS?<br>  ASK YOUR DAD.|`|IEN7FLEfaa	Yea, pretty much sums it up. There's the few who aren't "*****", but who wants to be with them? Hahaha|`|VqRAB3aKaa	maybe you gotta choose the right guy before you go on dating him stupid?|`|b5H1UEj8aa	Most of them are. There are some, however, that think with the right head...<br>  <br>  Good luck searchin'!|`|eEnVxEIMaa	Nope they're all tossers|`|jpidaPqFaa	Yes because they're born with them Its just all about their needs - most of them but i suppose there could be a few who are decent, thats why its called searching haha|`|0hqR2UeNaa	there are deffinately nice guys out there. how you present and act will attract that type of guy. for eg, a skank will never be seen with a successful nice guy...she will be with the losers. also we girls have a tendency to go for the 'bad boys' or ones we know wont be good for us because its a challenge and its exciting. good guy who treat us well are not exciting -- therefore theres no attraction! try dating a different type of man and see the difference.|`|SoMLkSPTaa	Trust me when I say this that yes ther are a lot nice guys out there it is like picking threw a barrel of aples some are rotten while others are good so try picking leave the rotten ones around|`|3LRxVPn4aa	some are incomplete <br>  and some don't know how to be|`|66e27cf33b665bf6f463e078a87766ceaa	nope!! there are a lot of them out there but if your convinced they are that's all your eyes will see!! be positive to attract positive guys!|`|Iwkxrfytaa	hahhaha most are.. alot of my female friends date wankers and always say how they want a nice guy like me.. relationsjp wise i'm pretty good, considerate, kind and nice|`|sCeezEI1aa	not all men, but there is some guys out there who are decent. i know it's hard to believe.
bobaZ7uSaa	I don't really have a lip preference but I like girls with short hair. It's easier to run my fingers through... and it's WAY easier on the girl... it's easier to clean, to dry, to manage. It's cheaper because you use less shampoo, conditioner, etc. It doesn't get in the way. Short hair really is better for the girl... I think that's why I like it so much.|`|7hrOjPwjaa	Its not about her appearance. Its about her personality and brains and the way she carries herself.|`|6gwx59Jtaa	honestly it all depends on the girl|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	Well not big lips that stand out like a black person's lips.<br>  Nor look like they have obviously had collagen injections/implants in them.<br>  <br>  Long straight blonde or dark brown hair.|`|8mm40agIaa	Luscious lips.<br>  Small lips are not fun to kiss.<br>  |`|GM41crl9aa	umm lol which lips and hair are we talking about?<br>  if it's down there the people who said shoulder length,,,,|`|UWaooG34aa	That they turn up at my door naked with beer.......! |`|ChwRcPBoaa	too big or too small is weird, so i guess in the middle is best for me, but i prefer leaning toward big. <br>  and i like long hair on girls usually|`|DBcp9M84aa	Lips: Not to big or to small.<br>  Hair: Long, brown, blonde or black.<br>  <br>  - and a good personality, like one that makes you want to get to know her better.|`|K5vcC1JFaa	Small Lips lol But Sumtimes I would prefer the big lips to sucka ma dong lol :) Angelina Jolie for example she must give great head|`|lA0tfH8saa	How about nice lips-whether Big or Small......and hair does not matter as long as it fits A PRETTY FACE.....|`|Rd2guW1Oaa	smallerish lips hair shoulder boob length color style depends on each girl|`|AA11124854	Beautiful face,nice hair and of course big busts;D|`|s8VISezzaa	besides the physical, my eyes and smile seem to do the magic for me *_*|`|yG81cxn5aa	Plump lips, conspicuous breasts, shapey waist and nice attitude|`|zTrOSRl2aa	I prefer Lips Kinda on the bigger side but not too big && Any Hair colour other than Ginger and longishh|`|082188467cedd117216669759eb168d4aa	Big lips like fish.

S4QBvAaGaa	Well you didn't give a picture of description of how you look so I can't give you fashion advice. A confident personality is a nice accessory to compliment any outfit(, as cheesy as that came off). ;D<br>  As per the person you turned down, do you want to get back together now?<br>  It's worth knowing why you turned him down in the first place to really tell you how you should face him again, or if it's worth a shot. If you're going to try anyway just be casual at first and later on when the moment's right feel free to apologize. It's a bit awkward but it helps to clear the air if you want another chance. After that, get to know him.<br>  *Note: I did not take into account that he might have become a vindictive monster set out on revenge by bringing some smoldering hot piece (woman or weapon) to the ball so my advice was based on ignoring that possibility!<br>  Good Luck! :)
zzUgYFy4aa	so are you saying that he says it over the phone??<br>  <br>  that means that he does not love you .. PERIOD!<br>  <br>  if he can not say it in your eyes then he is lying<br>  <br>  dump him!
92RbBUQqaa	dont do it ur nuts! shes needs counseling! i have a name if she needs it! find a new gf in ur own state! good luck
JR47sRpSaa	haha just ask her, "hey, will u be my girl?" if she says yeah then obviously she likes u.|`|WoRaXE73aa	Ask her if she likes you and if she would like to go out, like to a movie or dinner. Or, just simply ask her if she likes you. That simple.|`|h31I5hSAaa	talk. just ask her. use your mouth to form words. that is how it is usually done. just be honest and straight out ask her.|`|pRfSBmAQaa	girls like it when guys just straight out ask - it makes a girl feel like you are willing to put yourself out there for something you want. it also makes a girl feel like you care enough about her to pursue her :) just tell her you like her - don't be shy and don't EVER say 'nevermind' if she asks what you said. then ask her 'how do you feel about me?' you'll do fine!|`|Jqmyxmboaa	"Hi. I was wondering...how do you honestly feel about me? <br>  Do you see me as a friend, or is there more you would like to add?"<br>  or just simply,<br>  "Are you interested in me in any way?"|`|RAyRGH1Saa	just ask<br>  "are you interested in me" or "do you like me"<br>  and tell ehr you like her.<br>  <br>  <br>  help witht he last question i put up|`|HdmRtF71aa	ask her "do you want to do something with me"  have a plan of hwere your takin her and money and transportation and game|`|K0r2yEQmaa	I don't want to seem sarcastic by this, but why don't you just ask her out...?!<br>  If she's interested, she'll accept (assuming she's not already involved).<br>  <br>  I think if you just come out and say "are you interested in me", you could be putting her on the spot and it could make it awkward for both of you. Maybe ask her out in a setting where she is comfortable and relaxed. And it doesn't necessarily have to be a fancy date. Just a "hang-out" date. You and her can get acquainted without any pressure.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|66U83sQbaa	It depends on your age, if you are in High School, then I would try to find out through friends and if you get the idea that she does then how about asking her on a date.<br>  If you are in Middle School then you should do the same but ask her if you can have her cell and text her. It is the easiest way to talk to someone you are nervous around.<br>  Elementary--- well you can ask her to be your friend and see where it goes from there!!|`|MuSYw7m3aa	well if you like her then you should tell her you like her so if she likes you she will tell the truth about er feelings to you. you should say something like "well...i really like you and i just wanted to know if you had feelings for me" or sometihng like that. It doesnt have to be perfect, in fact its cuter when a guy stumbles a little. It shows he cares. But dont try to stumble or mess up. Just speak naturally and be confident but no too over the top. And most importantly be yourslef.<br>  good luck :D|`|qLFfzQw9aa	well first you should make sure that the girl knows that you like her and that your interested if she is. don't ask her. you don't want to make it seem like your desperate. if shes interested she'll probably show signs like non-stop talking. or whenver you see her in the halls or where ever, you smile and wave happily. and all the other obvious signs of interest.|`|HjYfvMInaa	well buddy take this advice from a girl it would be way way way better if you straight out ask her out because girls are boy crazy so just ask her out don't make her wait any longer you won't regret it!,take this advice from a girl, who's been there!|`|Hzw8wHusaa	Ask her out and if she rejects you then you know !
8II1frHiaa	while appreciating in explaining your friend, just think of your mom, since she is also interested in your future, so she is disliking him because of fear over your future.  ok.  your mom may be wrong in judging your boy friend, but it is your duty to convince your mom.  what to do for this ?  just explain your mom about the boy friend and in what ways he helps you etc.,  Don't forget to say about the background of your boy friend to her.  see, nothing impossible in this world.  so, try to convince your mother and make her to accept.  The race matter is with our blood and it will go slowly and it will take more years to hide.  your mom is interested on you and hence she opposes your decision.  if you convince her, she can accept your arguments.  if possible take your boy friend with you and have a fruitful discussion with your mother.  if your mother agrees, it is ok and happy and if she continues her opposition, say politely your decision and do as you wish because you took more steps to convince.
qVNSMkYlaa	just say "hey miss you. how about come over and catch up. catch a movie etc. when he gets there jump him
8RfKzNKSaa	Talk to him, you will never know if the feelings are returned if you don't talk to him... just say "hi".  That will go a long way.|`|dsgQ5cXRaa	Try talking to one of his friends about how he likes or have your friend ask him. Good luck( ;|`|DyTFo9vJaa	flirt and hope he asks you out|`|mMdKxnWXaa	get one of your friends to ask if he likes you.|`|OKWT0MxVaa	Sack up and talk to him. I'm sure he doesn't like shy girls.|`|jDiif0zmaa	you should sit him down and tellhim how you feel!!|`|AT5h3wU6aa	Leave the country|`|xClmPx2eaa	go up to him! go for it!
AA11909552	Go to him and say, "I need to try something". Then kiss him. He will NOT stop you. He will follow through! Trust me! He likes you and would LOVE it!
P7HdSzhKaa	you are already in there with her pretty deep dude.<br>  <br>  she wants you.<br>  <br>  trust me, if she has any dignity she woulld not just expose herself to you like that unless she loves it.<br>  <br>  yes she is probably holding her breath for you.|`|e6c881294365845ca26c842ba6710af6aa	Dude, she's letting you feel her up. Ask her out already!!! Sure, eventually you two might break up and the friendship could be lost. But if you don't ask her, someone else will. What are the odds that if she gets a serious boyfriend she's still gonna pal around with another male buddy, let alone one that she's messed around with? Your only option is to date her!
3zBq5AKLaa	just ask her simple question like how was your day<br>  and listen<br>  and show interest|`|gptsLYNRaa	Text her|`|QD2AJv22aa	bro--dont you know the rule?  Grace period?  sh i t do i have to say more?   You cant call her the first day or first weekend--thats desperate.  Even though u may be, dont do it...give her a casual unexpected call when you actually have something to do.  When u see her in school next week cuz u deff shouldnt call her this weekend, u say sry, u were busy all weekend n couldnt<br>  <br>  dont even text...no contact until next week via phone|`|oQcDZI9Daa	it's not about talking on the phone... it's about calling her and asking her out.|`|1jxGLs5waa	If u text her shorter conversations last much longer it helps...|`|w2SPRMiraa	be like, hey, whats up? How was your day?|`|JMYg9uOsaa	You should call her with a funny story, that's what i do when idk what to talk about
lb6jBcDiaa	dont worry about it<br>  but that kind of stuff is for your best friend when your eating a pint of ice cream|`|8j7FCEOraa	I wouldn't feel bad. I mean they were your friends right? Plus if they were worried about his behavior it could of saved them the grief of trying to get it out of him. If he doesn't talk to them often anyways then what does he care. He just doesn't want to look like the bad guy.|`|AA11967247	nope, wouldnt feel bad at all.<br>  guess what, if his family didnt want to talk to you then they would hang up. dont apologize.<br>  <br>  ..however, i wouldnt maintain an ongoing relationship with them, its not best practice.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Guess what?  He gets HIS family in a breakup.  No, I don't think it was your business to tell.  I'm sure it made you feel better, but the rest of the world is wondering if this is part of why he cheated on you.|`|AA10776535	No why will never trust you again...Don't bring in family member into your problems, that is the worse thing you can do...You should apologize.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	You should not feel guilty but your ex probably feels that what went on in your marriage was no concern of his family's. If you hadn't told them then they might have found out from someone else.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	It's so funny to me how people that cheat always find a way of turning the tables.  He is guilty, you are not.  He can't expect to cheat on his spouse and then expect you to be quiet about it.  You have absolutely no reasons to be loyal to him just because he's ashamed of himself.  If he doesn't want his dirty laundry aired then he should keep it clean.  I think that between a husband and wife some things are personal and shouldn't be talked about, like your sex life and intimate things you talk about, but this isn't one of them.|`|IT77K1gfaa	He does get his family in the break up no matter how close you are to them. If they are friends and you told them it is your business. If they are giving him a hard time then you were wrong. you need to examine your motives. did you do it hoping that they would give him a hard time or were your truly confiding in a friend? In the future find a new friend to confide in.|`|v3vBcyGLaa	I don't think you should feel bad under these circumstances.  It's not like you told them out of spite or because you were ranting.  It sounds like they are your friends and they wanted to know.  I understand why your ex might not like it... but he should talk to his siblings about not being so close with you.<br>  <br>  No need to apologize.|`|AA11537569	No.  They probably already knew that he was cheating or at least suspected.  He's probably mad because they know for sure now.  A cheater never wants to be expose.  I would not worry about.  Did he apologize for cheating on you?  If he did not apologize, consider you two even.|`|mCM363I9aa	I think he is right, why do they have to know?<br>  <br>  so when you fu** up should they know also?<br>  <br>  keep your personal lives to your selves, no one has to know so no one will be all in your business.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	NO not if they were or are your friends. Sucks to be him|`|cr2KKT6Naa	they needed to know. you did right .
mdE1HXMkaa	I've noticed that too. Best bet is too just keep sleeping with them.|`|2JBwCLwgaa	beacause now u feel like you guys have a realtoonship and u guys feel different about eachotjer|`|OX5osd1Naa	because it changes the whole equation, you now know everything about them, their body... etc..
AA10542233	That's perfectly normal.<br>  Smiling is usually a greeting.<br>  No, I don't htink she likes you, I think she's being poilite.|`|o6uwV66jaa	sounds like shes just a friendly person.<br>  do you know how many people I pass and smile at...or people who pass me and smile at me..<br>  it's the friendly thing to do.|`|h31I5hSAaa	maybe. either that r she doesnt want to be rude and ignore... but she might! depends wat else she does.|`|HQ6Ax4CUaa	Probably does.  Maybe next time instead of driving by, go by walking (with your dog preferably) and try to talk to her to see if she digs you.  If she seems happy talking to you, ask if she wants to hang out.  If she seems frustrated and creeped out, just say get out of the conversation and keep walking.  Try not to be a creeper though.|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	Usually you can just tell - what does your intuition say?|`|XBlokskEaa	Try and hang out with her outside of tutoring, then see how she acts around you.|`|AA10841229	She's just being polite. Like does she get nervous around you? My tutee freaks out around me sometimes lol and I can easily tell she likes me.|`|ehv6WbWDaa	Just because she smiles at you doesn't mean that she likes you. She might be just trying to be nice and polite. A good way to tell is if she normally outgoing but gets shy around you or laughs at bad jokes. Good luck us women are really hard to read :)|`|2d09327ea4cd614cbb7db85428b4dd5eaa	If you get a good vibe or you feel a certain energy around or from her then that gut feeling is probably right. You should wait for more clues though, but trust your intuition. She probably does like you.|`|Kfthg378aa	Just ask her out.  Give her this one... "Do you have a boyfriend?"  if she says no you reply ".......Want one?" <br>  <br>  All ya can do is ask.
u0udwkZQaa	Falling in love is just a more subtle way of saying he loves you. Guys don't like talking about feelings, that's all it is. If he has a lot to drink and you are having a good time together he will probably say it then because he will be less inhibited. With us guys, the difficulty is not showing love, it's expressing it by talking. We just don't like talking about it. The very fact he does love you, but hasn't got yet to the point he can say it in words literally, means he will try to show it all the time in the ways you just mentioned and more. It's better for you this way actually. It's easy for couples to get into the habit, one says love you then the other repeats it back, they're just words. He'll say it literally later on, but I wouldn't worry about it. Just enjoy the fruits of his love.|`|HOdblqIkaa	actions are more important then words. he may be scared of saying it but is doing everything he can to show you which in my opinion is more important then just hearing it. i would rather see a guy going out of his way to show me he loves me then just throwing the words around and doing nothing to back it up. my fiancee said it really early into our relationship but he has also given me no reason to doubt the meaning. he does absolutely everything he can for me and always has. give it time when hes ready to say it he will, but that doesnt make it 'official' its official when he can prove it in every day life and not with flowers and pretty things and words.|`|LHhds2tQaa	I told my girlfriend that I loved her after 8 days lol. We have only been with eachother but I honestly Love her. I would do anything for her.<br>  <br>  I think its important to say "I love you" as long as it has a backing to it. We both say it to eachother. I say it more though lol. And usually the first too. He could be shy. I was kinda shy but when I told her that I loved her I said it after hitting 3rd lol. It kinda came out and I truly meant it. <br>  <br>  He probably does love you but doesnt want to throw the word as casually as other people do. Maybe he just wants to wait. Dont make the first move let him do it.|`|AA10542233	There are relationships where you don't have to say "I love you" to communiate and tell them that you love them.<br>  <br>  ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS<br>  <br>  Sounds like your guy is telling you that he loves you a lot, by trying to make things perfect all the time. ;)|`|GsRpZJX5aa	definately just give it time. he is either in love with you or is falling in love with you. if its too long for you maybe you should talk to him. you know he doesnt have to be the first one to say i love you. if you are feeling it too say something!!|`|8zd6OqJ5aa	aww this is so sweet =]<br>  <br>  Well is it important to you? It must be if you want him to say it to you =]<br>  <br>  He seems like the real deal so I think he does mean it. Has he ever been in love before and if yes hurt? because if he has then he might be worried that you don't feel the same and he doesn't want to get hurt =/<br>  <br>  So basically talk to him about it! Really, if you 2 are as great as you say then he should be understanding and caring and listen to what you have to say. Or you could even try saying it to him first =0.<br>  <br>  But I believe talking about it is best =]<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and good luck =D|`|Aksdpf0gaa	I think that he is probably just nervous. If he said he is falling in love then he probably already has. He may be waiting on you to say it first. (in the case he may be afraid you wont say it back if he says it first). If you feel it and you know you are...then you should tell him. Im sure it will work out like its supposed to! Good luck! love is great
HQb4wL1Eaa	depends on the girl. For most women it is alright to show interest. Just dont be toooo in her face because that become salker-ish. Just be your self|`|5wnqb95Taa	not all the time. Sometimes it's a turnoff for some girls if they don't like him back.But some girls like it because they have the same feelings in exchange.|`|kQgSi1MEaa	For the most part, yes. <br>  <br>  Unless she REALLY wants you,.
4VyzYbegaa	depending on what you're into you could go bowling, or to an arcade, play miniature golf, go to a museum, or a park...movies make crappy first dates cause you don't get a chance to converse
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	not if u already got the divorce, and to do anything like that she would have to go back to court, and prove that this other woman posed a threat to the safety to her children. can't add a thing once the divorce is final.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	No she cannot and by the sound of it, you're well out of it! She has no right to keep you away from your own children and the courts will back you up on that as will your attorney.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I've heard yes. Your attorney can fight it though. What a b*tch. Unless you have no judgment in women. Well, she doesn't make you look good.|`|wpi36XBAaa	I doubt it, especially if the divorce is already finalised (you did call her your ex). <br>  After all would she accept the same clause if you put it in about HER and the kids? "What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander"  - its only "sort of" fair if it goes BOTH ways.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Yes, but you would have to agree to it or the 2 of you would have to go to court over it before it would actually be input.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	No she cant.<br>  <br>  You are the father and you have rights.<br>  <br>  Simply dont agree to that.<br>  <br>  You should get a lawyer, as it could get ugly.....<br>  <br>  You are entitled to have a life after divorce.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	if the divorce is already finalized, it will have to go before a judge unless you agree to it. If it goes to court she will have to prove that the other party poses a threat to the children's health, safety and/or well-being. <br>  If you are already divorced, I'd tell her to take you to court. As long as you are providing your children with a healthy safe environment, who it is with should not matter (unless the other party is not a good influence on your children) Remember, your children should always come first. <br>  It really sounds like your ex-wife is jealous and is trying to make you squirm. Stand your ground, always be polite, never discuss with or in front of the kids, document everything! Speak to your attorney!<br>  Good luck|`|9scpRClxaa	Talk to your attorney, but in some states, there is something called a "morality clause" that can be added to divorce/visitation agreements that basically state that you cannot have anyone (usually of the opposite sex) that you are not related to spend the night while your kids are there.  <br>  <br>  If your ex feels that your roommate is a danger to the children, she might want the clause.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	She can request that stipulation, but you do not have to agree to it.<br>  Most people would counter with something equally stupid, like "for as long as the children do not visit she will need to pay you 4X value of child support for every scheduled visit missed".<br>  <br>  Eventually both of you will have to drop your petty crap and agree.|`|0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Yes, she can.  Even during these times, living with someone without being married is frowned upon in court...  especially when it involves children.  Exposing children to numerous partners is not healthy and you shouldn't want to put them through that as their father.  If you want some booty then go somewhere else to get it.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	If she has a good reason for it, yes. but if your children are 13yr or older, depending on which state you live in, they have a choice to see you or not.|`|tRMwKXQdaa	defiantly because  if you are living with someone and you think you know them pretty well but your wife doesn't  so she wouldnt  like her kids are around a stranger she doesn't know. wouldn't you feel uneasy if your kids where around some strange guy you don't know|`|wia9SXCPaa	She can demand anything she likes.  Now if she gets that demand is quite another subject.  I don't believe it is un heard of, but its pretty unlikely unless you have some past she can prove in court.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|BAVPrCAeaa	no
gC8xO53Oaa	There is making friends and then making good ones. Anyone can make friends , but to have a good friend, you must be one yourself. Friends can start with the littlest things, but the good ones evolve by them seeing your dedication, sincerity, helpfulness and putting their feelings up front when it calls for it. Kind of like a marriage. If you want it, you have to be it.|`|QwHLZaS6aa	HELP this is a problem everyone whose not popular has!! i need new friends to and im sorry i cant answer it i have the same problem b/c my friends are jerks ):<br>  <br>  speaking of which..:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225124424AAnR34k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
Qgg6i6K7aa	KICK HER OUT of the bridal party. <br>  It might sound mean but you don't need any extra stress. <br>  You didn't want her as bridesmaid in the first place, you were stuck with her and she's being a brat. <br>  I wouldn't be able to deal with that, there are so many important things that should be using your wedding planning time. <br>  Everyone should see how much of a problem she is and they should understand and if they don't too bad. <br>  It's your Wedding and things should be the way you want them. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congratulations.|`|F8iYNurEaa	What a horrible situation. I really feel for you. Why is it that when someone's getting married, everyone around them feels like they have some sort of say in how the day goes, or what the bridesmaids wear, or the colour scheme, or who you invite to be bridesmaid etc etc? The whole point of the wedding gets lost in this frenzy of demands from relatives! Anyway, I think you need to approach your future mother-in-law and tell her how upset you've been by this girl's attitude towards you. You're right. If she is so horrible to you, why should she be YOUR bridesmaid? Explain that, while you were initially pleased to have her as a bridesmaid, her behaviour towards you is unacceptable,  and that if it doesn't improve then you will refuse to have her as your bridesmaid. If you can't explain this to her yourself then you need to ask your fiance to have a word with his mother. I know he won't want to get involved in this situation but unfortunately it has got to the point where you have no choice but to involve him. By giving his family an ultimatum, you are showing that you are trying to involve this brat of a girl, and if she continues in this way then she has no one but herself to blame if she loses her bridesmaid status.|`|ScHW4842aa	No offense, but she probably saw your hesitation when it came to having her as a bridesmaid. <br>  Personally? I would ring her mother up and tell her that unless she spoke to me within the next 24 hours, she is out of the wedding. <br>  I would tell my fiance this - I would tell my mother in law - etc. <br>  <br>  Then do it. <br>  F*ck her. <br>  At 15 she has common sense.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Okay!  Your first mistake is asking other opinions about th dresses.  PICK ONE!  DON'T ASK FOR OPINIONS OR YOU"LL GET THEM!!  LOL  I learned that with my wedding.......people are very free with what they want and quickly forget that this day is about what you want.  I would simply order he the dress in a large and if she has to have it taken it, then you can say that you had asked many times for her preference.<br>  <br>  Also, can I ask what your fiance is doing about all thins?  This is his niece after all.  He should be able to step in when his family is concerned and take the heat off of you.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	talk to your fiance then drop her, it is worth 200.00 for the peace of mind.|`|1a8f556a514b8f836795e2adfdcd3848aa	Drop kick her to the curb with a quickness, she is being difficult, uncooperative and seems like she's not interested in being in your wedding anyway. That's 3 strikes. It's your day, your way. Anybody gets mad they will get over it.|`|ACecbVghaa	It doesn't sound like she wants to be a bridesmaid, it sounds like she was volunteered. I would politely tell her that her lack of enthusiasm is alarming and she can forget it. She obviously isn't interested.|`|SIp2QgiWaa	It's your day not hers , and you are paying for the dresses ! let her go i wouldn't keep asking or calling and i would have a back up to take her place. Besides you are marring him not his family. Sounds like she is in control of this and not you. Stop it know|`|TTjDATeOaa	Wow, that is a sucky situation to be in, but I'm of the opinion that it's your wedding and you should make yourself happy, cuz everything you do could potentially make someone else mad! Good luck!|`|ZilmGEwmaa	Sorry...if you can't eliminate a guy out then find another girl to replace her and fast. Don't deal with that. It's going to cause you MORE stress when it comes to your day and on your day. Just replace her or don't have an extra couple if at all possible. Who cares if they whine about it...? They are causing you problems about YOUR wedding. She isn't cooperative.|`|g7zDWqSTaa	Unfortunately at this point, it might be better to just keep her in the wedding to avoid problems with your future mother-in-law.  I would just get her the dress and not expect any help from her for your wedding.  Let your other bridesmaids help you out and truly be there for you on your big day.  I hope this helps....best wishes!|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	If she wanted to be in your wedding she would act like it. 15 or not, and besides this is your big day and partially your fiance's :) ! She could be acting out to keep from saying she doesnt want to be in the bridal party, to spare your feelings. Maybe since its his blood he can reason with her. I would advise you to give it one more shot and then to heck with her. As far as grandma it is not her show and 200 is worth a lot these days.|`|nVJOq8T5aa	To be honest with you. It is ultimately your choice, if you are finding hard to get thru to this little girl then you have to let it go and just keep your bridesmaids as your sisters. No one absolutely no one should obligate you to do anything on your big day. Tell her parents and your fiancee I'm sorry but this is not work I cant handle your cousin and that's it no explanations. You cant be a friend with a 15 year old.|`|hkwBR1moaa	First, you've already agreed to let her be in it so there is not much you can do there without hurting anyones feelings.  So lets move on to how we can fix the other problems.<br>  She's 15, tell her she's a jr. bridesmaid instead of a bridesmaid and let her dress be slightly different.  More age appropriate.  And tell your MIL that medium or large is not a 'bigger' girl.<br>  Again, she's 15, so anything you need from her, ask her mom.  She's the legal adult here.  <br>  Good Luck!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i know people hate the "its your wedding, do what you want" answers, but for the love of god, in this situation, if you want to drop her, drop her.  your reaching a point where its probably going to be too late to actually order any sort of dress for her, your having to  go through other reletives to get any information on her, and all that other nonsense as well.  if she plays victim, tough titties on her.  she's fifteen, thats more than old enough to start taking responsibilities like provideing mesurements for bridesmaids dresses.  the whole "shes a teenager" thing will only get her so far in life.<br>  <br>    if anyone complains, just say that you rand out of time and had to order dresses before it was too late, and that since she wouldnt commit to a style, there was no other choice

sTqzGwvvaa	you are right to be upset but please please vent out all that hurt on something that can help you get all those feelings out and don't don't go back that's just hurting you more i got out of a similar situation with a woman that could not love me and heard many good and bad things about her but i ultimately decided that she and i are better off far from each other before you jump into another relationship make sure a you are ready b you are completely over that person another thing is that dating guys to get rid of someone only hurts you and the person you are dating  some exercises that can help you get over someone is writing a letter to him or her and then destroying said letter or painting a picture thinking about that person its okay to cry but remember to not carry your wounds for a long time the last thing the next person you date wants to hear is you wound story its not attractive remember to not victimize yourself remember another thing and this important if you cant find your dream person become it and then you will attract that person into your life good luck and keep your chin up|`|N95SuGi1aa	Well... i would certainly be pretty mad but dont let it ruin your life just pretend it never happened ( i know that will be very hard) but why let something in the past ruin your future when it may never be resolved    who knows .. someday you might meet a great guy and buy your very own cat  and name it something cute! lol|`|7Q6xdO6Yaa	He is a complete jerk.Forget about him an go get a new life.|`|mDBoWBCkaa	well you do have the right to be a little upset.<br>  maybe after you two ended he began to try to see maybe other things or ways that he could change and he is giving them a shot.<br>  dont be upset.. odds are he is just ready to try other t hings and forget him hes not worried about u dont be worried ober him|`|1L7UGe49aa	well i dont think you should be mad. if any bodyshould be mad its him for being such a liar....if he hate kats why'd he get one? i bet it was for the chick but he doesnt want to admit that to make you feel bad......but you really shouldnt be mad because thats extremely petty and who cares about his damn cat... u should just move on and find a better guy than him that wont lie to you|`|uJkoUhFvaa	I don't think it's wrong, I think it's pointless.<br>  Why do you care so much?<br>  Why is this relevant to your life now?<br>  Is this "close friend of his who you don't really talk to" likely to stir things to annoy you?<br>  Your relationship didn't work. You tried three times.<br>  Sorry this is harsh, but I think you need to get over it and move on.<br>  It's glaringly obvious to me that your ex has already done so.....|`|pORmp0tfaa	You ran into this guy at a car wash and he told you ALL THAT? Right. Look, he obviously loves this girl and he's happy. Yeah it sucks that he's moved on but instead of obsessing about what's going on in his life go move on yourself and find a new guy. He has every right to move on and be happy, and so do you so go be happy!<br>  <br>  Also, maybe the reason he's making compromises and doing this stuff for her is because he didn't do it for you and you guys didn't work out. He's learned from his mistakes.|`|GsSRY7quaa	the real question should be "why should you care?" he's your ex....
NJDfdjCtaa	Ask her how she feels about you & her and talk to her. Ask about what she thinks of kissing etc. but never rush anything, just let it all happen in it's own time and only when she says she feels ready. You’ll want to be in a relationship for a long time before you start taking it any further than kissing. You and her are probably too young at 14 anyway for anything 'more'.<br>  <br>  Acting in any way pushy with her or rushing things is a surefire way to convince her you're still a kid and don’t have any respect for her, plus she'd probably run off to her friends and gossip about you and spread rumors like most girls that age do. Not good. :p So take things easy and talk to her first about it and ask how she feels. Good luck!|`|6JEGirE4aa	Um, why can't you ask? She'll likely be flattered, a bit thrown off center, and it'll give her a chance to say yes or no.<br>  Or you can try the line "hey baby, I'm looking for someone to be a filthy wh0re along with me. Interested?"|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Start by kissing her cheek or jawline. If she doesn't stop you, kiss the side of her mouth.. If she still doesn't stop you, just kiss her!<br>  <br>  She's probably nervous herself, so don't worry.|`|kK3wD2ataa	Don't do anymore than kiss at 14!|`|4K33z7dpaa	i would kiss her at a randome moment and see what her reaction is. well that's what i would do. if she likes it she wants more but if she's kind of shy that's enough for the day.|`|TBQxNUXiaa	1 Hug her<br>  #2 Look at her eyes<br>  #3 Nail it-> kiss her|`|2t1Py4MMaa	you just kiss her.|`|Bip9F2Wraa	If you're going out with her, then what's the problem?
xYhJWHH1aa	I would say it Differs with every guy. Most guys will not get erect wit a short shirt or a low blouse. Physical contact is the most common reason. Some times a unexpected view of panties or a great breast view and cause it to happen. A movie with strong sexual content as well.|`|OQGf77kiaa	very easily...|`|XWmqMwr0aa	Yes your theory about skirts ans low cut shirts is true.<br>  It's why I don't wear shorts.|`|pe4XMdHsaa	when you are younger , than yes ANYTHING can trigger one ..<br>  even when on the bus hahaha|`|fQxOTYt0aa	so easily. if i'm wearing a dress and my boyfriend can see my legs, he's already got one.|`|GiC4tzMVaa	^^self props!|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	i just got one|`|LXD5cPszaa	It can happen from any of those things,it can happen alone or from anything I mean I got one and my pants ripped lol there wasnt anything even there (or anyone)<br>  they happen whenever and wherever|`|UHTcpdkVaa	When they are young, you can get one thinking about clouds.

I really was busy and live a hectic lifestyle. eventually she asked me out. We went out. I really wanted her, and from there it was good and I could pursue her. <br>  I guess I didn't act too soon and asked her to be together because it faultered, i think. So act sooner after the first good date. <br>  So basically dont fall into her game, do your own thing whatever it is and live your life. She'll come to you after everytime you guys meet per chance and those are pretty big. Be you and flirt.<br>  <br>  Check out my questions, they pretty much deal with your situation. I asked two not too far back about that. Comment too if you want.|`|oMa3lkjhaa	if she's playing hard to get, she probably wants you to make the first move. if you like her back, do it. usually, girls who play hard to get want that guy to be a little aggressive (not overly). whisper a compliment in her ear and pull her close, she'll go wild.|`|hf2av6dHaa	Maybe be if you pretend to be the "busy" guy you would have the girl in your knees.<br>  <br>  Just continue, she wants to see if your boyfriend material.|`|wfUJypjFaa	we'll if she knows u .. and its a game .. <br>  u can also play hard to get .. and c if she comes 2 u ... <br>       eventualy she will but .. it all depends on the girl as we'll|`|AA10519469	She's a gamer huh? ok well flip the switch..play HER game YOU play hard to get, Kinda like a cat and mouse.

qCwra9sAaa	the first thing is usually something physical. Like Legs, chest, backside, build, hair face or eyes. All men are different in what they find physically attractive. I would also place general health (fitness) and Hygiene here. Physical attraction is usually the start. <br>  <br>  Second for me is Positive vs negative attitude or personality. Also socially outgoing or an invert. That's a big sliding scale. You should be very similar to someone you are attracted to.<br>  <br>  Third is attachment. some women are too clingy or ask for constant attention. Some want Very little time or contact. Somewhere in the middle is likely the best, but once again everyone is different.<br>  <br>  Next would be physical contact. Not just sexual, but some people are the touchy feely type and some are not. usually the two don't mix well. I found that even after years of marriage people can find themselves sexually incompatible. If its wrong from the start it will get worse with time.<br>  <br>  Then there are Religious, political, moral attitudes. This area is much higher on some peoples list. Long term you should find common ground here.

Since your a guy like me, I would tell your father since father and sons have that bond. I dont know what kind of guy you are, but heres what I would do. I am 19 and graduated last year. I was a bit of a class clown, popular with the ladies, you know THAT guy. But i also had a bit of a temper and if i was angry or upset i wore it on my sleeve. i would definetly let you know if i was pissed off. i wouldnt take it lying down. next time he touched me i would push him off and say, "look bro, i dont know who the **** you think you are, but you have no god damn right to touch me. it is completely innapropriate, and if you ever put a ******* hand on me again ill fade your *** outside in the parking lot." Now obviously that isn't the best way to go about it and i understand that, but my temper gets the best of me. but if you ask him nicely it really wont help much. you need to make him understand that that **** is NOT ok. again, i dont know what kind of guy you are, but if guys crossed a line with me i would call them out and fight them. you cant really do that with your teacher so tell someone. but if he touches you after that i would seriously hit him. dont be afraid, just ball up your fist and break his nose.

e643b8219ff2696b25de8efe6b23a1ebaa	Making her feel jealous is DEFINITELY and POSITIVELY childish.. Believe me.. Doing this would end up in a fight between you and your GF.. If you're mature enough to get into a relationship, you should be mature enough to handle her friends.. Why not try hanging out with her guy friends? I don't think there'll be any problem with that and your GF would appreciate it more.. They're just 'guy friends' and making your GF not hang out with them is like saying "SHE IS MINE AND MINE ALONE! PEOPLE, GET LOST!!!" No need to be too selfish.. Trust your GF.. If not, hang out with her group of friends..<br>  <br>  It's not like your GF will leave you for them.. Keep thinking and acting the way your are acting now and she could possible just leave you.. Stop being insecure and too possessive..

(I'm assuming long distance because you talk about e-mailing and calling, but not actually meeting).<br>  <br>  Buy yeah, sometimes e-mail can lack emotion or concern, at it might have seemed to him that you were insensitive about something.   It might be his way of teaching you a lesson.  <br>  <br>  Don't jump to conclusions about him cheating.  You don't know anything yet, so your safest bet is to just try and talk to him, and find out what happened.|`|06a618b5935b51e12f424a8ffa603e6daa	You didn't do anything wrong....it just sounds like he lost interest.

Flesh tunnels are hollow tunnels, usually used in stretched or scalpelled piercings (generally large gauge ear piercings). Some people may choose to wear flesh tunnels instead of flesh plugs because they weigh less, especially at larger sizes. Flesh tunnels may be worn with a ball closure ring or other object passed through them.<br>  <br>  Flesh tunnels can be made from many materials. Surgical steel, titanium, Pyrex glass, silicone, acrylic plastic and a variety of natural materials, including bone, horn, amber, bamboo, stone, and wood all are common materials for flesh tunnels. Flesh tunnels, like flesh plugs, may contain a varitey of decorative inlays or semi-precious stones. Some flesh tunnels have flares at one or both ends to keep the jewelry from falling out, or in the absence of flares, grooves may be cut near the edges to allow rubber or silicone o-rings to hold the jewelry in place.<br>  <br>  Flesh tunnels are also sometimes called spools, earlets, or eyelets.|`|9ced39f1c3cdd62a23dac929b1aeff2baa	what the hell is a flesh tunnel and if i am asking i guess i don't|`|16cadf15f7057bef68893a2e86f782b2aa	I don't even know what a flesh tunnel is?!?|`|22504226330e276dfa4c035cff0f3c7aaa	Thanks Daniel....<br>  <br>  And T na, no.|`|23680f1d2c948f3a8d65cf3f18c1577eaa	When you say flesh tunnel you are going to have to be explicet. . . is it part of a womans anatomy, a mans, or something entirely?

ecc0a1ae4443ce502548265ac0cd1200aa	So, where they just friends or did he sleep with her? If he is lying about this, then there is no way you can trust him. If he is telling the truth, are you being overly jealous? Hard to know without extra detail. I think it is possible for someone to change, however it would take a lot of work to rebuild the type of trust for a healthy relationship, and that would require him being totally honest in everything for quite awhile and the other party to be able to completely forgive after a time. This type of effort could possibly be worth it if you were married, but if you are just dating, I don't see the point. just move on.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i don't think we ever can feel the same about them again, and it does affect the relationship to know he chose her over u, and is lying and saying nothing went on, but there was something emotional going on with them. i would say once a cheater always one and too much is required to trust again, u have to have the faith of jobe, and how many of us do? personally if i were cheated on, knowing what i know today i would never go back to a cheater, i would never again trust them, because my experience has been that they never stop doing it, and it's just one let down after another, if they cheated once their love for u wasn't that strong anyway the way i see it, just an opinion and years at the school of hard knocks.|`|a1b618eecf5148f01401e7648a5fe69faa	Yes, he will always cheat.  Once a cheater, always a cheater.  You caught him with her and he said he didn't sleep with her?  I think in this case it means, they didn't get much sleep.  He's only sorry because he got caught.  Please dump tis ***#ole before he hurts you anymore.  Now that he's been found out, the mind games will begin.  Save your heart.........get out fast.|`|4b0a709da4e0ca46677111434fe8fb02aa	No.  Not necessarily.  As I've said before, the question is can you forgive him or at least believe that he won't cheat?  Will you always wonder who he's with or what he's doing if he doesn't tell you where he is or answer his phone when you call him?  If the answer is 'yes', then it doesn't matter if he cheats or not, because you will always doubt him.  If that's the case, then save yourself the stress and leave him now.<br>  <br>  If you can get past this, then move forward and stay with him.  Only YOU can determine if he's trustworthy or not.  We can't.|`|66a5f3b314b4589bd0a91fe7ec319264aa	yes it will happen again and wat will be his next excuse???|`|AA10993379	IF HE CHEATED <br>  HE WILL ALWAYS CHEAT <br>  KICK HIM IN THE BALLS|`|b60d09a113f6381e8fdda6c3a9384a51aa	dam.n dat sux.. anywya <br>  1. dont make contact with him for like 3 weeks or more. n make him come back to u.<br>  2. ignore him (dont make him think dat ur letting him of soo easy)<br>  3. or just brake up with him (ONCE A CHEATER ALWAYS A CHEATER!)

Plus women can't change guys, they like to operate under this delusion but truthfully they can't.<br>  <br>  By continuing to be with him does this validate his bad behaviour?  Aren't you making it easier for him to cheat?  If he doesn't want to be with you he needs to have the courage to let you go so he can be with someone he wants to be with.

728dd02530291c3fcc6564deaaa10333aa	Just because you have a boyfriend doesn't mean your life has to end. That is a mistake many people make, even married people.You can enjoy your life and your relationship at the same time. You should be making time for you, your friends, and your family as well as your beau. What it sounds like is that you have not found a way to balance all the loves of your life. <br>  When in a relationship, it makes it more interesting when you have separate lives because you'll have interesting things to talk about when you do get together. For example if you are into art-get a group of your girlfriends together and hit up several art galleries or take a class. <br>  Make sure you do not make your boyfriend your life. You are young and you should be enjoying life that way you don't lose sight of who you are, as an individual.|`|3f1db15e3b6ce261ebfd4157b5571c75aa	You need to ask yourself a few questions. Do the things you want to do involve another guy? If you answered yes to this question then you probably aren't as much in love as you think you are. Are you just wanting to hang with friends and do things that really shouldn't affect your relationship and he doesn't approve? Then he probably has some control issues and it will probably only get worst. If you are that young and you feel like you are missing out, then maybe you really aren't ready for a serious relationship. Love means compromise and trust and respecting each others feelings. Sounds like you need to grow more as an individual. If he doesn't respect that, maybe he's not the guy for you.|`|73973a1bbf05e60d59590ca014dee183aa	If you feel trapped than maybe you need to tell your boyfriend that you need some time and space to live your life. That you don't necessarily want to break up, but you need a break, because your both so young and need to see what is out there. I hope that this helps.|`|a6a300e1a109a21cbd03d146112ecb53aa	stop complaining|`|4693765ecf9eb01f203a308220ced3d3aa	This usually happens when there it is an all-consuming relationship, which can be quite overwhelming. Just take a break in your relationship. Tell him it would be good for the both of you if you didn't meet each other for a brief period of time. Explore on your own. Meet people. Indulge in activities. After a break you will feel much better. You will know exactly what you are looking for and be honest about it.

AA11240997	Your age will make a difference on how you approach her but I hope you are over 17 or so (without curfew). Well, go buy the tickets and take her to the concert without dinner first. After the concert ask her about food. If she said she is starving thats a opportunity to talk about many thing over dinner. If she says not hunger, go grab ice cream or some kind of sweet. The key here is eye contact, laughter, smiles and slownest. If she doesnt rush the dinner or dessert then she is interested in you and doesnt want to leave your presence.

When you live in another country...and go to the states...it's CRAP!  "Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses..."  hahaha sounds all inspiring eh?  Little do the immigrants know that if they're tired, they'll probably get sick and die...because they're immigrants, they don't have insurance and so they don't get treatment.  If they're poor, then they're completely SOL...sent to live in the shanty towns that are called the projects, have no chance of going to a good college because ummm they're poor.  The huddled masses will be sent off to pick potatoes in Idaho or something.  In addition, immigrants have to contend with racist rednecks.  And who knows what will happen to them if they don't learn how to speak "American"  hahaha.

Lfc9Zav2aa	At least her wants to spend time with his child. If hes a good father let him see the child as often as he can without taking from your time with the baby.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I couldn't bare to be away from my daughter over night at that young age. I think most judges want the child to stay with the mother until she is a little older before starting overnight visits. I would suggest you stick to the same schedule you have as it seems to be working out for you. I would think more along the lines of visits ever two weeks were he could see her on Saturday and Sunday instead of just one day a week. That way, you wouldn't have to think about taking her every week to see her dad and could have a normal weekend without having to think about getting your daughter to her dad's. But again, it sounds like the situation is working out and if he is fine with it, then don't change anything. When she is older and ready to be away over night, then you can make some changes.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Ask for what you think willwork and then ask for what youre willing to settle for and both dont have to be the same|`|5b2d156b924538e090ecddccd4f39d54aa	I'm sure that you can bring up that concern that he has not spent much time with your child and that would be considered, but if you two can not agree on a visitation schedule then usually the courts have whats called a standard visitation schedule.  for example in the state i live in standard visitation is every wednesday, and then every other weekend.  you may adjust this to fit schedules and needs...but again they usually have what is set to standard visitation especially if he is ordered to pay child support|`|Z2YgGifCaa	Usually each state has their own guidelines regarding what the courts consider "reasonable parenting time" and your lawyer should be able to tell you more about that for your state.<br>  <br>  I live in Michigan and you can read our guidelines as an example, or do a Google search by putting... state + Parenting Time guidelines.

Contrary to what one poster said below, there is NO "tender years" doctrine where the courts prefer that young children (even babies) stay with their mother.  The likelihood is that over a period of the next several months, the court will phase-in overnight visits on alternate weekends, first just one night, then increasing to two overnights.  <br>  Good luck. <br>  Karen<br>  www.parkavenueguidetodivorce.typepad.c...

Go to marriage counseling if you can, you may be able to work through it and remember why you loved your spouse to begin with. Marriage is a promise usually to at least the end of life, if not to eternity. That kind of promise deserves to be fought for. This does not mean that there is no reason for divorce, but it is not something to be taken lightly. Divorces affect many people beyond the two who were married. I am an adult child of a divorced family and I can tell you that unhealthy marriages and divorces wreak havoc on the children involved. You also have a community of family and friends who celebrated your marriage with you, and will mourn a divorce as well. These are not reasons to sacrifice your own well being for the sake of a marriage, but they are reasons to fight for a marriage and try everything possible to make it a happy, fulfilling relationship for the both of you.<br>  <br>  "The Seven Principles for Making a Marriage Work"  by John Gottman is a great book about marriage.

And have been a single mom. It is tough. But a man that gets violent with you, only gets worste. He will probably promise you he will change and it wont happen again. And maybe even buy you things. But it will get worste. He hits you once, sees he got away with it, there will be a secound. Until one day, could be years from now, when you do get fed up with it, he will be too far gone, and start to threaten your life. I've seen and heard it happen too much. You can make it on your own. Just have faith in yourself. You will find, with a child you have to provide for, there is nothing you can't do.|`|Z2xETWhbaa	Get some self esteem and know that you don't deserve this.  I know it is easier said than done but you need to leave this man.  First of all he doesn't act like a father and he treats you like dirt because you let him.  Your son deserves better and so do you.  If you leave him and take him to court you can get mandatory child support and if you can't go back to your family go on welfare TEMPORALIY until you can finish school and can support both of you.  Your son is seeing how his father treats his mother and is going to grow up thinking that this behavior is acceptable.  You should not be stuck with someone who treats you this way just because you have a son together.  YOU NEED to be strong and know that it will be hard but you can do it all yourself.  For every struggle you have will soon be followed by some type of reward.  Having a son who treats his future wife and girlfriends with the respect they deserve will be one reward you will have to think of..  I hope that you follow this advice.  It will be hard but will get better.  You CAN DO IT.  Always remember people treat you how you ALLOW them to treat you.  This is a motto that I live by.  GOOD LUCK.  PS if you do follow this advice make your next relationship a good and healthy one.|`|xtH1eDITaa	I understand how it would be hard to tell him to leave. You've been together for a while now, and you were so young! My best advise for you would to make him leave. It will be hard. Very hard, but if you are paying the bills and doing pretty much everything on your own, you really don't need someone there to put stress on you, or your child. Maybe he'll grow out of it, but in the process someone could get hurt.

goIQpSfZaa	How long has this been going on? Months, weeks, years? If it's a "sudden" change- as in he used to shower regularly, wear clean clothes, etc. and now all of a sudden he doesn't clean up- then I think his mental state should be investigated. Most people are taught to clean themselves daily. Unless he was never taught, there's no excuse. But there is a chance that he is depressed or has other mental/emotional problems happening to him. If the jokes and loving words aren't working- try an intervention. Everyone, including the commanding officer, get together and confront the issue. Don't be angry or hurtful, but be direct. Give him the straight talk. Tell him exactly why you all are intervening and tell him exactly what he does wrong. Tell him what he needs to fix and how you plan to help. Find out about his moods, his feelings. Hopefully you can have a professional counselor to help. If for some reason he is perfectly content and happy to be dirty, then it's time to consider cutting him out of your lives. Good luck with your friend!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	He needs to go to the doctor.

rlIwpkQQaa	maybe you should get a little closer to her before you ask her. like, make it sort of obvious that you like her, but not in a way that is too obvious. take her out, talk to her often, and then, when the time is right, and prom isn't too far away and you have a feeling there is competition, ask her to the prom as soon as you find out. if she asks why, tell her how you really feel before it's too late.|`|n6ujjsamaa	No! Beat the compition! You be the one to ask her first! The other guys will be jelious! ASK HER ASAP!!!|`|KN7L9hWAaa	Nope! ask now!|`|oQcDZI9Daa	ask early... you wouldn't want to wait only to find out that she was already asked by someone else.<br>  get on it!|`|8MDFKrrfaa	Nope ask her asap!!!
TAXmD9lyaa	I remember at the beginning of school year my brother(who's a junior) asked out this sophmore girl at a dance and they're still going out. Just dance with her during a slow song and ask her then our maybe wherever also it makes you comfortable to ask.
xzlmgH8baa	Basically explain to her when she asks to hang out that you just wanna hang with "the guys" its dumb but it has worked|`|Qa6dFF4Eaa	in this one you gotta suck it up big boy! a relationship needs good communication. it might hurt her a little at first but make sure she knows how you feel about her but say you need time for yourself too. now depending on her personality she'll take this to a certain degree. as long as you still hang out with her a lot and show how you feel about her it'll smooth over (:|`|Hgd9Ln0Zaa	On one hand you say you can't stand to be apart, then you say you feel smothered.  Make up your mind will ya?|`|eZ884HfPaa	She's only being like that because she doesn't want to lose you.  Just tell her your going to hang out with the guys once in a while or|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	if you arrange for a girls night out she may think that your up to something  or with some one else so I would say no to that, sorry careful how you handle this she might think your fall out of love with her because girls can be funny like that they sometimes read things into something that is not there  you can tell her that your not feeling your self and just need to be on your own tonight that you maybe coming down with something  or your just feeling mentally tired and need some space and that you really love her a lot and you need this for both of you good luck|`|cdQUHft8aa	tell her you need a little space, but not in a mean way.<br>  i don't know just say something sweet like...<br>  <br>  "babe, i love hanging out with you, but lately i think it's been a bit much."|`|d5lzqsxmaa	Tell her to give you some space. She might get mad, but tell her the truth. If she loves you, then she will understand. .|`|JMYg9uOsaa	Reccomend a G.N.O (girls night out) You dont want her to forget her friends.|`|Rt1FfBchaa	dude ask yourslef, what is the problem and what do you want more.<br>  <br>  <br>  EAISLY      O-O|`|YDr8EO5Taa	Tell her she smells bad.|`|LWtVFWw7aa	tell her you want your space, but dnt make it sound like ur breakin up.|`|AA11627720	tell her.<br>  and be grateful that you guys have strong feelings toward each other haha|`|Bu2asnXFaa	Communicate with her.  Any reasonable person understands that you can't be hanging with someone all the time.  Everyone needs their space.
8yE2sYGeaa	Hard to say, as he is a bit tough to find if they are still here|`|AKfZDADmaa	yes common sense has not used yahoo in a long time|`|HZKsNwbeaa	no he isnt. he is gone|`|S1TUEEm1aa	search for him? why not email him...?|`|zTBscfuraa	idk look 4 him in the search box|`|1l7bK325aa	yes? i don't know...|`|zbtKzMDhaa	ask him!|`|ReFjTVBCaa	Yes, he is.
XH2o1MM6aa	Let him have a look at some cleavage.Nothing naughty. Just enough to get his mind on other matters.And I don't mean the TV.
MTjUlIIkaa	yeah its just belly dancing sitting down lol
iOJH7SP6aa	I don't think there is much to say, she just doesn't like you like that. And it's hard to just be like "oh we danced and i know you like me, but im just going to talk to you like we are friends."<br>  get over her find someone else... it's high school|`|n3w71p8gaa	it seems like you guys got along pretty well at the dance sooo maybe she just likes you and is acting weird. don't give up just yet (:|`|mdE1HXMkaa	tl:dr
BXd4I9mmaa	He sounds like a tool. Kick him out|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You need to be in counseling together. He needs to straighten his own a@@ out yesterday,|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	You need to find out why, or what his reasons are for wanting the divorce.  There has to be something, it's highly unlikely that he just decided on a divorce out of the blue.  I'll bet any $$ he wants to see other women.  <br>  <br>  If he wants the divorce, then do not sit around waiting for him to decide.  Tell him you want to know now, right now, what is it going to be.  Tell him you want to know why and get him to talk.  <br>  <br>  Counseling might be what you guys need.  But if your husband refuses to go, then it means your marriage is not important to him. And if that's the case, you should go forward with the divorce.|`|djUMvICoaa	Who wanted the marriage?  Who set the date?   Do you think he felt pushed into it?  He sounds like a person who feels trapped in his relationship.  Yet he likes it the way it is.  You have someone who is playing mind games with you at the very least.  For only 10 months into a marriage it didn't take long for the honeymoon to get over.  Or else he is checking something out on the other side of the fence, you know where the grass is supposed to be greener and something caught his eye and he doesn't know how to tell you or doesn't want to be the one to end the marriage.  He wants you to so that he can save face, that he didn't want it you did.  I think that no matter what the reason, I'd just give him what he wants.  You deserve better than that.  And if he has something going on the side it probably won't last, they usually don't.  He'll want to come back.  But I'd leave him in my rear view mirror and in the dust.  You need you peace of mind and you will find somebody that will give that to you.  good luck|`|AA10776535	No one should use the word divorce unless they really mean it.  I would have told him there's the door, don't let it hit you where the good lord split you.  He seems confused about this so i wouldn't bring it up...If you keep asking you'll end up getting a divorce.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Tell him to crap or get off the pot.  He is controlling you through your emotions.|`|aeLyiRczaa	This sucks and my heart does go out to you.  But, in all honesty, in a way, you are perfectly suited to understand this.  You are female and this is the typical stuff females pull on males all the time.<br>  <br>  Get into see a counselor, preferably a minister who does counseling.
37M3dkkRaa	ok thats messed up. im a girl and i don't even know...maybe its just drunk talk?|`|ze4Gt1araa	I think she doesn't know what she truly wants. If I were you I'll ask her what does she really want. And if she really wants to go with you than go for it! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mZnHKNEAaa	What that meant was, when she initially called you she was feeling emotional, missing you.  She texted you but as she was speaking she realized what she was saying and started to back track.  Thats why she made it clear before she was done that she needs time to figure it out.  She was just drunk texting, lonely, missing you. Take it for what it is and don't look too deep.|`|DiZh2XC2aa	i think what's new to her is the feelings she's having...i know she's drunk...but give her the time of day until you're sure you don't want her at all...obivously you care by asking this q, so yeah<br>  <br>  Ema|`|7QDYWAkfaa	Well she was drunk.  Usually people are being honest when they are drunk.  She probably misses you if she said she does.|`|anOpR6b9aa	lol shes drunk but u should wait until shes sober so u can ask her.. maybe u  or  her can give eachother a 2dn chance|`|tUDgxv88aa	If she was drunk...try talking to her when she is sober. There may be some feelings hiding in her that she didn't know about until she did get drunk. Just try to talk it out...in person preferably...so you can SEE how she reacts to what you say. If you still like her try to sort everything out. It couldn't be much worse for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3Bw4e9Bvaa	listen bro....the fact is she was drunk people say the truth comes out when your drunk i dont buy that ****.....you gottah ask her how she really feels when shes not drunk so you'll know what to do from there good luck|`|jvjziDGeaa	Be bold ask her staight up. Do you or do you not want to be with me? If not quit screwing with my head.
RuO5o8Vdaa	she is probably just flirting, girls like to do that :) i know we are mean|`|nCcpmnM7aa	ima sophmore in hs to.and usually when girls do that it's just because they're flirts.and c'mon man grabbing your butt.that's niiiice and all but most guys i know wouldn't be into having a relationship with such a girl.so,it's up to you.:)|`|Oy5nMZ0xaa	ok she might just be playin u if she does it all the time. i think u should go for it though cause those are really strong signs so try!|`|WZwQPr39aa	if shes a hard girl to get, she might just be a flirt. see how she acts to other boys and if she acts more differently towards you, such as her not touching other guys' butts, then she might like you.|`|ee5da6bc3e3cad5066f5a5f59bb8a5eeaa	You can be sure she does but she will want you to tell her you like her first.|`|1I1tTaxeaa	its obvious she loves you.<br>  just ask her out<br>  i guarantee you she'll say yes
acafdcce761f87a23b935269eb5f71f2aa	Pheromones work on receptors in the brain and have no obvious odor.  Judging from your physical attraction in certain instances, I'm hypothesizing that a sense of smell is not needed to experience the effect.|`|sgNrh9WPaa	Pheremones are not the same thing as hormones.  Pheremones are scents that can only be triggered by smell, so having no sense of smell does indeed mean you are immune to pheremones.|`|0jyUdOTZaa	probably not. the feelings you are experiencing from hormones are not necessarily triggered by smell. it would be more likely that a guy would smell them on a girl, just like all other mammals (male animals can smell when a female is fertile or "in heat") i believe this is true. perhaps you have some built up sexual energy that is creating those?|`|B5M2np0Waa	sure
yckGp7mlaa	Cute because those are the ones who don't usually think so much of themselves.They also don't have high expectations so it makes it easier for us.They have the uncanny ability to keep things interesting in a good way.Beautiful girls and hot girls have to many guys chasing after them and that makes it a little not worth while.So yeah,definately a cute girl would work out better.|`|IN91l9Nuaa	Beautiful is best. Sometimes, cute might not be enough, and sometimes, hot is just too much. My girlfriend is beautiful and I love her. But it really doesn't matter all that much about the looks. The thing that really matters is if that one special person can love you as much as you love them. I hope this helps and good luck winning the bet!|`|BaVeBiBfaa	I don't mind about a female's look, It's just sad that our transient world and society have dismissed values over Arrogance, hypocrisy and bad judgment. Even though I care little about looks I do like a woman with a nice behind. but she does not necessarily have to be "cute looking " or beautiful. Looks  are deceiving at times.|`|6fFWZXSqaa	I'm 64 years old, and a pretty woman will still turn my head.  However, as you grow older, it's more about being valued as a whole person and not the external beauty that's important.  In my youth, my vote would have been for cute.|`|PV85Qq8qaa	beautiful|`|bcAxwlzyaa	all three|`|sjYnhV9naa	cute first beautiful second hot comes last|`|tlmihxYHaa	all of the above, i love my women well rounded =)

tjGsyFvwaa	A guy who claims to have never finding true love because that means to a girl that she has a chance to show what it is....<br>  and if you really havent then that means you wont keep on bringing up the past and girls hate that  and you also wont think on how you loved a girl from the past and you wont compare a new love for things an old one did|`|TbjPh36Xaa	never found true love....i like me some challenges, lol|`|pfQ0fv1Faa	neither if it just a line! Try just saying hello!|`|r6TNqGGFaa	A guy who is honest about his past.|`|xATfmcBLaa	my guy said he thought he was inlove before til he met me, and it worked like a charm:)
nkhoIyQjaa	Not really... it could mean shes been with a bigger guy a couple of times...<br>  <br>  But it probably means your pounding the crap out of her. lol<br>  <br>  Dont jack rabbit it so much :P|`|2no1OfNaaa	it might not be her cheating ... it might be her just loosing up sometiems when women have sex reguraly she tends to losen up...|`|AA12268818	You are a loser !|`|ISU8UdNdaa	She might be pleasuring herself with a giant dildo which is quite healthy and natural . One bonus is you are less likely to prematurely ejaculate . I once had a girl so loose you could park a humvee in there(i am disease free).|`|yxTE5XF5aa	NO , That thing is made up in such a way that such decisions can not be derived. Its all in ur mind bcoz of something else.<br>  anyway dont loose sleep. here there is no expiry date.
aAHP2Z61aa	just focus on starting up a conversation with a different girl every day. begin with a "hello" and take it from there. if you go to a small school, then it shouldn't take long to go through everyone. and by then, you'll feel comfortable enough to be able to do it without thinking much about it, and everyone else will realize that you aren't so shy anymore. most of all, don't forget to smile!|`|70fbd9b515138e758b572eb5428f66eeaa	It sounds like you already have it figured out. Just start talking like it's something you do all the time. sorry about the name, i hope it doesn't hinder you when getting a job.|`|03xUjR4Taa	heyy im a sophmore too<br>  and all i can say is when i look for guys i loo for funny sweet kind nice easy going and especially cute so i guess all i can say is loosen up and try to have fun. dont worry about pop but if you honestly worry just go to all the things she goes to like parties and stuff put your self out there<br>  <br>  havee funn<br>  : ] ]|`|59SObVbhaa	first off all if this girl is popular you should look really good because the first thing she thinks about before she hangs out w/someone is if they look good and have a good reputation since she doesn't want to be seen with a wierd person<br>  <br>  when you talk to her start out with something exciting like if you know something that she is really interested in or something that just happened at school then just trail off and say things like ask if someone you know is in one of her classes or something like that
h205kE2haa	tie him to a chair and tease him<br>  <br>  making him think you are going to have sex with him<br>  <br>  then blindfold him, "take care of yourself"<br>  <br>  say thanks sarcastically<br>  <br>  then go out for a few hours|`|CuJjdTVXaa	Have him strip down naked, tie him to the bed and then put whipped cream all over him....at that point YOU can decide do I want to stay or do I want to go....good luck|`|9jizUHNLaa	put a strap on and rape his anus|`|eAOYccHBaa	TELL HIM YOU WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER TOGETHER AND THEN DO SOMETHING ELSE WHILE HE IS IN THERE

If the calender is your only problem, I'd love to trade problems with you.|`|rifjqRc1aa	I've dated older and younger men than me. In my experience though it just seems to be easier to date men in the same range. But....<br>  <br>  an older guy is normally a bit more settled (not always though). You might find the things he liked at first start to irritate him (your energy and youth) and the things you liked start to irritate you (his been settled).<br>  <br>  Its not a bad gap you have so I think go for it, every experience is different so no one can really advise you.  Its really up to you two to make it work. Plus you both already have a lot in common.<br>  <br>  enjoy!|`|wqbXPytuaa	24 and 39 its like 15 years apart...I don't think it will be a good relationship. I dated a girl that is younger then me about 8 years, and I thought that's max already...but 15?I think that's too much...when u have a child with him, he'll be 40+ and u'll still 20+, your child is 10, he'll be 50+ and ur 30+. He wont be there as much you would be for your child. Think ahead.|`|z4OzlzdLaa	I am engaged to a man who is 8 years older than I am... he was 30 when we met and I was 22.  For us it was more a matter of where we were in our lives, which I think is far more important than the age itself.  If you feel like you two are compatible and that you are both stable individually than that is one thing... but if you are at different places/stages of your lives it might be tough to work out.  Do you both want the same things out of a relationship?  Is he ready to settle down?  If so, are you?!  Are you interested in casual dating?  Does the age affect your relationship currently?  Things to consider...   And PS... everyone has baggage  ;)
WunxrnU5aa	U "dont know y he would be attracted to a single 6 mos pregnant 17yr old" ... he knows u put out! .... Duh!<br>  <br>  Ok, I went back & reread everyones comments to u. Let me just say that I myself was pregnant at 17 & everybody said the same type of ish to me. My son is 10 yrs old now & I have 2 college degrees & a dam good job. My baby father left me while I was preg. & right after, I met another guy ... about 2 mos later.  To this day ... 10 yrs later, he is me & my sons best friend... he allways been there. So, with that said, u really have to make your own decision on this one. There's pro's & con's 2 every decision u make in life.  In the process of making your decisions, F what anyone has to say. Do u with your head up. <br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|AA11852692	I would say you can have him as a friend, but just focus on what's important at this moment, which is your baby.... If that guy really interested in you and want to be in your life, he'll wait and settle for being friends at this moment due to the circumstances... It don't matter what other people say since it's a small town... The town is not going to support the baby, but at the same time you have to give yourself time and respect your baby... Good luck and congrats.|`|AA10349442	At this point, I'd say to be friends and nothing more than that.  Small towns can be difficult but you can't really live up to other peoples expectations no matter what you do.|`|50waeYLWaa	he probably sees you as an easy one and now that you know what happens when you have sex you have to wait and that would be illegal bc you are under 18 and he is over and it is state law|`|H5eTlCvFaa	ok first of all way were u having sex with someone at the age of 17<br>  but other than that it is cool that u found someone that is intersted in u and ur child even though it isnt his|`|aQauZf5Jaa	who cares what they think are you a slut??if not who cares you know what you are or are not..no some guys see that and just feel they need to take care of you....its cute....he must like you alot no its not sluty ...but if you do get series call him ur bf well if you stay together for at least a month call him ur bf =)|`|aTIqRxKAaa	Nope.<br>  Have Fun<br>  Enjoy|`|01c3f588cba09f55bea29620277595a5aa	That's great that an another guy is showing interest in you despite your pregnancy. That proves that the guy is in love w/ you cause I don't know that many guys who would show interest in a knocked-up girl. If he makes up feel special, just ignore people who likes to make judgment on people.  Your happiness is more important than what other people think of you. I hope everything will turn out good for you|`|41f972580e8fd3a9243daaa59479bd50aa	Chances are some people already think it when you're that young, unmarried, and pregnant.

I've actually heard guys say they go for pregnant chicks/chicks who were never married and have kids since they "obviously put out."|`|66527f564cb254f9e419f49c964e40e5aa	No, i don't see anything wrong as long as you take it slow.|`|AA11609649	This is why parents try to tell their kids THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE!!!

JuNf9cnJaa	Perhaps you need to talk to someone who is a Professional medium or something?  Check it out, they have paranormal investigators that will look into your situation.  Also paranormal activity usually occurs when there is a lot of chaos in your life.  For example, your life is troubled, or your House is a disaster, your anxiety level is higher then normal, you think about it so much it actually appears.  <br>  Paranormal activity is very real and can sometimes worsen!  Once you recognize there is paranormal activity it can sometimes trigger more frequent visits.... Also is can sometimes increase the paranormal activity making it stronger and more apparent.  <br>  Google search paranormal investigators.... or medium investigators in your area.  If it is a "bad Oman" it can start to disrupt your life.  Also try not to say the name of the "spirit" as I've heard it can ALSO make paranormal activity more distinct because they become aware that YOU are aware of their presents.<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|b0d1be009491a87c770b3458819fb122aa	Karan,<br>  you can be assured in one thing:  It was NOT  your father!!<br>  <br>  What you tell is typical of wicked spirits, of demons, of illoyal angels who turned their back towards the almighty God, Jehovah.<br>  <br>  As their leader, who is known as "Satan" (what means "enemy") and "Devil" (what means "calumnator"),  they desire unrightfully to be worshipped by humans, but fail to prove worthy being worshipped.<br>  <br>  What can you do?<br>  <br>  When the next time they molest u, call loudly to Jehovah for help!<br>  <br>  And study the bible;  help you get at www.watchtower.org ...

PoE5IvRiaa	well first you need to know what type of guy's she's into! you will know because every time she is talking to you and she tells you about her day she will smile and say like"can you believe what so and so did to me today?" or something to that affect! :) and if she's the type that likes attention then that means she doesn't like a shy guy, she likes the guys that give her hugs and aren't afraid to. and that plays around with her! ;) I really hopes this helps and GOOD LUCK! :)|`|5kTILEIDaa	u have to show her ur true awesome self<br>  and reveal it, hoping she realizes she likes u.<br>  try asking her out for a day to hang out like<br>  to the movies/mall. and if it seems like its going<br>  well then just tell her u like her. (:
PoE5IvRiaa	oh my gosh! i have the exact same problem!! i always fall for the guy who gives me that type of attention! i just love the attention, hearing that he loves me!! holding me, giving me hugs, telling everyone im his girl when im not! :)|`|QPIn20xyaa	maybe your horny and like any guy to get a piece of yo ****?|`|N25KzCANaa	Maybe its due to a tendency that you've fell in.  Maybe liking that player/bad boy image and even tho you try you fall into that trap every time because that one sweet spot keeps calling you back.  In the long run, it won't be good.  Those guys only want one thing most of the time, and if you not obliging to give that to them i'd say to seriously sit back and re-evaluate what you want.  Where i grew up, alot of the young girls did the same exact thing, and alot of them are walking around with babies and a dead-beat dad who think he can mack the whole town.  I hope that you fall out of this habit.  I know i absolutely dont know anything about your situations, but as a human, and a soul i dont want you too get your heart broken!  So maybe sit back, reflect, look out the window, tune up the ipod/mp3 player what ever you do to get your mind right...And just think about what it is that turns you to these guys and Mature from that...not in a mean way , but grow up out of that tendency.  Find someone that gives you a paragraph instead of a run-on sentence!  That person that makes your heart melt, not just burn.  When you find him you will know!  Good luck, and please be safe!<br>  <br>  Hope i've helped if just a lil...
SxztcjXXaa	Hi bro...clear your mind first.<br>  You wish to have a short term passionate relationship with her rite? <br>  But it seems like she have something MORE than what your feeling towards her...If she is not the rite one to fit your situation " DONT TRY".<br>  It is better for you to get away rather than break her heart since you don't want "friends with benefits"<br>  Make her as your good friend indeed.

Don't worry....Always cheer yourself.....

nv4QV1OVaa	Based on your attitude, I'd say that you need something soon. If you are so materialistic now then your marriage is doomed to fail. Good luck! |`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Too late for a prenup.  It's called PRE for a reason.  Talk to an attorney about what you can do now, but I think you're stuck.  Anything you get now is considered marital property and he is entitled to half.  Your inheritance from your grandmother will probably be safe, but you need to check with an attorney about the laws in your state.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	A contractual agreement can be arranged at anytime and it will be binding.  Instead of calling it a prenup, call it a contract of marriage agreement.<br>  <br>  As long as both of you are comfortable with the terms and are willing to sign it, its binding in court.|`|J9oQ8dCYaa	Yes, you can do a post nup.  You should EACH have seperate lawyers unless the money or property involved is inherited. Inheritance generally is not part of marital property with lots of exceptions depending on your state.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Since you are already married, there is nothing to make the other person sign the document, if they don't want to.|`|oqX0PwQiaa	You can still get a post nuptial agreement. You need to contact an attorney for all the details.|`|JgU9vaP4aa	right now u have nothing..............so what ever u have is sort of (at least half) from your husband. you want him to suffer and help support you through med school........ do without things........... just so you can remind him that the reward from this hard sacrifice will be NOTHING. if you want to leave him afterward. ??? am i seeing this correct? <br>  there have been law suits during a divorce where the "med student turned DR" had to pay the other party for the support he gave while the dr was in skl. this goes under Scarface as well. the other party gives up alot of things to see the Med student become a dr. and this other party should be entitled to something if after the hard work is finished..the dr wants to leave. it has been done you know.<br>  i dont think it would be ok within your marriage to ask for one. it will set a distrust within the marriage. he will think about WHY NOW? HUMMMMM???????????<br>  if my hubby would ask me for this i would think he was on the ay out or at least planning on getting out one day. when a marriage is hard work the pre nump (or post nump) would be so easy to pack up and move..........without one you may have to work a bit.<br>  as for your grandmothers estate...........he cant touch that. <br>  |`|H3WHxCgaaa	Don't count your chickens before they hatch...in terms of divorce you would split the marital property and earnings.  Unless you have hundreds of thousands of dollars stashed after you finish school (I somehow am not seeing that) - then there won't be much split up. I am not sure what you are looking to accomplish now with such an agreement - it appears that you would be building your life together and married or not your spouse isn't entitled to inheritance assets.  Personally - I just wouldn't bother, but that's me.|`|AA12202402	You need to google your state and community property laws. After a certain length of time a community property state says all stuff that came into a marriage is split when a marriage falls apart. You may want to try to get him to sign an agreement stating if this happens or that, But then again you two are all ready married and that I bet will be a huge problem|`|EFaEHXAvaa	Actually why don't you fix the real mistake.. You know the one where this guy deserves better then you, so you fix it by leaving him.<br>  |`|OYgtlTEfaa	Do you live in one of those states where a license to practice medicine is considered community property ?<br>  <br>  |`|6oZagLCvaa	you can always get one if he is willing to sign,<br>  <br>  my 2 cents|`|2tCbCvzXaa	Why are you worried about your money.  Are you that sure your marriage is going to fail? what was the point in getting married then?|`|ECnWTWZYaa	nope it's too late now|`|AA11414777	It is called a prenup because it comes before the marriage, so yes it is too late.  You need to talk to a lawyer to see if anything is available to help you out.  Depending on what state you live in, if you should get a divorce you might be able to keep any inheritance you receive from your grandmother but any future earnings will be split between you and your husband, especially if he is helping to put you through medical school.  And there is a good chance that you could end up paying him alimony too.|`|AA10478165	To late! The only good news is anything you get from your Grandmother he can't touch.Always get a prenupt.Good luck.

TDLyqejqaa	I hate to be so brutally honest, but yes, it does matter. Think about it this way: How often do you see a physically mismatched pair together? It's rare that you see a "heavy" girl with a thin guy. How many bald men are dating super models? Yes, other things matter (personality, money, attitude, etc.), but a physical attraction is imperative. It's just a fact of life. I am not saying that it's necessarily right, but it's a fact. Also, and I am not trying to be mean, but being curvy and proud of it isn't always a good thing. It's okay to be happy and self-confident if you're healthy, but if you border on unhealthy / obese, then it's nothing to be proud of.|`|XTFlgAcWaa	i like a girl who is pretty, smart, funny, chill and some1 who is not fat. cause when ur fat that jus means u dont take care of ur body.

Most guys don't insist on a "perfect body" but fat is rarely a turn on.|`|Wd9hHa33aa	well she doesnt have to have perfect body but she has to have an average looking face atleast and for sure she gotta have booty but it all comes down to getting to know someone if you both click then its a hit but if theres no chemistry then no.|`|fzZt2sF3aa	I prefer a girl who isn't like the rest.<br>  <br>  One that can actually decide for herself what she wants to look like instead of propaganda TV ads and such.|`|0Idp3oSSaa	I feel that my girlfriend need huge floppy pancake titties and a gaping vagina!|`|veZ0o1RUaa	yeah guys are shallow jackasses <br>  it's all good youre fine the way you are |`|9l3qnrUxaa	Mature men don't care.

You dont need to sink down that low. In love the guy willl come to you at some point in life and he will love everything about you even if you are 180 pounds.|`|d4395a68f7b2f61370afcb9fd1673d34aa	Reading the previous answers... I love girls who say "Men are shallow" as women are blatently equally as shallow as men, it's human nature.  My short answer... I don't like overweight girls but I do like curvy girls who would probably not be considered to have a perfect body (there's a difference).  Personality generally matters more though with relationships, she could be stunning but if she had a personality of an ironing board no chance.|`|xqm8LgpGaa	this is my 17 years old point of view. well I do care what she looks like, but only if I don't know that person that well.  but I had times were I got to know someone that was ether chubby or a little too skinny for my taste and started to like them because of their personallity.  So my answer for you is yes and no.  yes because of someone that I don't know too well Im going to look at there apperance. and no because when you get to know someone and you really like their personallity then i start to look at them differently.  I hope this helps.|`|aSSSzktWaa	Up Like A Crackhead's got it. Sure, what's on the inside is where it's at, but you have to attract them first.

QtHvBj9Gaa	Honey, you are being taken for a king size ride. OK so the guy is sweet and he's studying hard, but there are limits. Sounds like he has one easy ticket in life. If you are providing the roof over his head, nearly all his meals, acting as his personal chauffeur as well as being bank of girlfriend, what is he doing ? Boy, he'd better be damn good in the sack !! Seriously though, he is way out of line. As for his kid brother, that is the final straw. From where I sit, it sounds like you'll end up providing free meals and accommodation for two, plus being general servant/driver etc. <br>  <br>  Now there are limits to anyone's generosity. I reckon you've done way more than any reasonable man would expect. Ths guy sounds like a leech. Do yourself a favour and tell him to take a hike.|`|suuQjkoOaa	you definetly paying for your bf and definetly not getting a good bang for the buck..  you are way to genereous for getting no return,, then he wants extra? he want you to pay for his little brothers flight too?  sorry.. time to put all  his stuff outside and change the locks.|`|a358acbf6adf701866cfcd08356591daaa	Yes, definitely you should put your foot on your boyfriend butt and push him out the door... in fact I think you should have done that long time ago!!!|`|YIWLPp2uaa	are you a guy?|`|zrzudyVwaa	Are you serious? Why is it your responsibility to take care of your boyfriend like he is a child? He has a job; he should get a car, buy food, pay rent, etc. He is an ADULT, and just because he doesn't want to grow up and be responsible doesn't meant he doesn't have to. You're just providing him with an easy way out.<br>  Tell him to get his own car, buy some food, and pay rent. If he doesn't, tell him to be careful so the door doesn't smack his *** on the way out.|`|JsUzlD0zaa	I say give him the boot, he's obviously using you and not contributing any support. His brother, whom you say you do not know, is not your responsibility. Tell him to take care of his own brother, and grow up while he's at it. I think you should have left long ago, but I also know how relationships go. Well, hope this helps. Good luck, sounds like you can use as much as you can get! <br>  P.S. You are not being hard on anyone but you.|`|E5BdeSleaa	Tell him you're fine hanging out with his brother but that he should know that if you're spending that much time with him and partying with him like that, that something might happen and that you won't be to blame for it.<br>  <br>  One second thinking about you messing around with his brother should freak him out enough to get him ready to have a serious discussion.|`|09Qcwbsiaa	maybe u could say that: well, i wanted to tell u that i think u have depending too much on me, if u want to continue the relationship, maybe u could be more indepentdent. and then u smile widely at him.|`|ba1ff7b2dab7ea4e1c2a6018dafa1a0caa	I would stop paying for his things.  He should be contributing to your finances.  Talk to him about this.  |`|1EwE9udAaa	its time to put your foot down if it was him doing it for you he prolly would have stop a LONG time ago a realashionship is a 2 way thing not you being his *****|`|cGmXMsf9aa	No your not being to hard tell him your busy and you need time for yourself. |`|MlDs21jAaa	i'm going to guess that he's that way because it's what you've allowed him to do. it's time for you to put your foot down and be honest with him. while i applaud the effort of his medical studies, he's forgetting that you are not his MOTHER, but his GIRLFRIEND. You deserve to be treated with the same respect and love that he expects you to give and shower him with the same. If he can't accept that or respect your requests then it might be time for him to get a foot in his ***. stand up for your self and don't let anyone walk all over you. ever. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|xYTQOxOVaa	that's stupid. why would you want to take care of NOT ONLY YOUR BOYFRIEND but his brother too lol.|`|mPSTNmPSaa	Are you serious? Sounds more like your bragging than anything else. I mean who has to ask if this is fair? If you really are that naive, you wouldn't be on here asking this question, you would just continue to let him walk all over you!! You're the one making the choices to stay and live that way!!! Merry Christmas!!!!!<br>  |`|hHndD5SEaa	Are you his girlfriend or his mother??! Yes put your foot down - its bad enough you have to support him without his brother whilst hes there as well!!!<br>  xx

Otherwise maybe call her and just chat about nothing to get her mind off being sick..<br>  <br>  how thoughtful :)|`|At8D5Xu2aa	Bring her a "sick" package.  You could include some medicine like stuff for her throat or whatever, but also some magazines for her to read, maybe a DVD for her to watch, a book, or burn her a CD.

If it's marriage and kids, then I would definately suggest that meeting up would be good.  If it's just a pen pal, then you should be ok without meeting.|`|GI27dKIkaa	He's probably shagging a cheer-leader as you type !|`|ZKT4E6yDaa	It didn't work for Ross in Friends so it will not work for you!|`|10knD5g0aa	I'm from England and I have a brother who met an American girl while he was at uni in London.

We are in two different corners of the globe, much further then urs and so far its been almost 6 months and we still feel the same about each other like the first time we met.

Write letters, no not emails, real ones remember to put in a kiss in there. :) Order some flowers. And of course eventually if u guys are willing, phone sex can be very gratifying.

fb9d1f1c3641dca47af29550714ff132aa	In the large scale of things the right answer would be to slow down a bit, because things change so fast in high school.. maybe even 3 months down the road none of this would matter, but I've been your age before so I'll give you a more suitable answer after a bit of info/advice.<br>  <br>  Life is full of mistakes and miscalculations.  Especially during those high school years people are so fickle.  You don't really gain much knowledge of self and inner growth through sex.  Sharing your body with whomever you want is your prerogative, but you only have one chance to gain either a positive or negative reputation and once you gain it...it will remain with people for years....trust me it does.<br>  <br>  The answer is simple follow your heart.  In my life, the things I regretted most is when my heart was telling me one thing and I did the opposite.  Yeah sometimes following your heart leads to pain, misery, and embarrassment, but at least you would know vs not knowing.  MAKE SURE it's your heart though and not your hormones.  Don't confuse the two.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12196449	Don't feed the trolls!!!|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	tl;dr|`|S1TUEEm1aa	If you don't like the guy that's in love with you then yeah, send him the text and don't lead him on. As for the other two guys, don't have sex with them. The black/white guy just wants to have some fun, and the other guy has a g/f that he wouldn't be cheating on her with you, and is a player. You will regret it if you do, the only guy who actually cares about you, is the one you don't have feelings for.|`|0fw9gvzwaa	u let a guy finger you in the middle of class?!<br>  maybe that's why ur considered a little ho<br>  I'm not being mean but come on girl u can do much better than that|`|D3JVIjz8aa	tl;dr|`|Ebr1SiSPaa	ok they people who want to do stuff just want you because i dont know but your probably hot to them right? but this other guy the gentlemen he seems better. im mean what would you do if you some how got pregnant! i mean im a sophomore too and seriosly i knew a girl who is ruining her life because she insists on being a ****. She is discusting and nobody likes her because of what she does even the guys. and if your gona text the guy thats just low tell him to his face or at least call him|`|HZkDGjqHaa	i agree with the ryan m dude about how you should ditch the players and go for the nice guy.  and i totally disagree about what ryan said about sticking to your own race.  DIVERSITY IS GOOD FYI!!! and wait until marriage.  your to young to be doing that.|`|oAOPphQWaa	Wow. The guy doesn't know what love is he is just lusting for you also. You should get with the nice guy and not with the two players. And it is disgusting that you would mess with a black guy... stick to your race girl...|`|AA10743159	You are sliding down a slippery slope, and it seems already getting a bad reputation at school. <br>  So you seriously need to think of what you want in life. To be a good girl, wife and mother, or just be happy being a "Hoe".<br>  It seems that your body is doing all the thinking for you, just now and not your mind.<br>  At least, you realize that the third boy, cares for you and you don't wish to hurt him, but texting, isn't the way to do it. Face to face or at least on the phone, talking to him. It's harder, but the right thing to do.<br>  So I suggest, you let your brain, control your body, meanwhile, until you get yourself straight, on what you want to be in life.|`|JVG4oyLKaa	wow

If he wants be with you in a serious relationship, he should resist her advances and tell her that the only relationship that he and her can have is to be partners in raising their child. You can't force someone to be with you. If he is truly dead set on being with this girl there's not much you can do about it, but air your feelings about the situation. If he really loves you, then you shouldn't have anything to worry about.|`|N8rA8AJ1aa	kill that *****!!!!!!!!!!!!! and you will have him to yourself again!!! :)

Be happy!|`|wck4MHREaa	Give up any and all hope that you'll be "more than friends" with her. You screwed up, big time, and your window is now closed. Her whole "I like you, but not enough to leave my boyfriend" is mostly a sign of her own insecurity with her feelings (and her inability to make a decision), so leave that be.<br>  <br>  Fixing your friendship is doable however, you just have to talk to her and explain how you feel, without withholding anything. It's up to her whether she'll completely forgive you or not, but good luck regardless.

I've already told my boyfriend that if he goes on a trip with a female friend (one he slept with) our relationship is 100% over.<br>  <br>  Be the mature one and end it now. Don't take his calls, don't text him. When he gets back tell him in person that you don't want to be with him and it's over. Don't sit around and wait for him to cheat and then come crawling back.

This won't be the first or last time he'll expect you to understand his "guy" thing.|`|NGKwsawdaa	tell him this: yes I am alive, but you are dead to me so leave me the hell alone. He should get the point|`|DAU9lIO7aa	We males can be a bit "short minded" sometimes. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you two have reached the level in which you should make something serious of your steps? <br>  <br>  So do not hesitate. Phone him and let him know that you are alive but also that you feel that you want to take the relationship to a more serious point such as no more... from his side.<br>  <br>  If he says "Ok. I like that too." I congratulate you too.<br>  <br>  If seems doubtful or says no.<br>  <br>  Well, then you should accept his answer and maintain your relationship as friends - brother and sister - although you (without his knowledge) begin to search for Mr Right.|`|SdmwrVpbaa	You sound like a very smart girl. Listen to the voice in your hear and walk away.  Text him back and tell him you have moved on.  If he is that much of a sneak - you need him like you need a divorce.  There are plenty of honest guys out there. Thumbs up - YOU FOUND OUT NOW !  : )|`|y2nC8BUGaa	text him back or call him and tell him "The fact that your boytrip involves other girls isn't ok with me."|`|MuVKeK8faa	Leave him alone and move on already..|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Still thinking about this guy? Do you like being hurt?|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Tell him to leave u the fcuk alone.|`|OK3Ktffwaa	Well being a guy I can tell you it's killing him that you won't or haven't text him back. At the same time that is good torture, if you do that for the duration of his trip he won't have a good time, this however could backfire on you. Say for example when he gets back and you are 'alive' he will feel a sense of relief but once that comes and goes he may give you a hard time about 'ruining' his trip. If you do text him make sure it's a one sided conversation as in give him short preferably one word responses. He'll at least know you're okay and that you're pissed off too.<br>  <br>  help me with mines too?|`|i15KoiJhaa	Oh snap!<br>  <br>  "Guy Trips" first, do not include ANY Girls regardless of the nature of the "Friendship" secondly, your Boyfriend booked this trip without even discussing it with you... red flag....<br>  <br>  If this trip was no big deal and he really had nothing to hide then he wouldn't have.... <br>  <br>  I think your sending him a huge message in NOT responding at all.<br>  He didn't seem to wish to talk or text with you PRIOR to making these plans... so he ought to be all good with remaining that way at this point.<br>  <br>  Hell, if you can afford it book yourself a Girls Trip to take place at the same time, different location... and if there are some Guy Friends included in this trip... all the better.<br>  <br>  The Butthead!
wia9SXCPaa	I am so sorry.  It breaks my heart to hear that story once again.  My husband slept with another woman for 2 1/2 years without me knowing and is in love with her.  I wish I could tell you the right answer.  Almost everyone on Yahoo told me to get a divorce, get some dignity, and stop being a doormat.  You know its a lot easier said than done.<br>  <br>  First of all you need to know how you feel.  Do you still love him?  Do you want to try to get past this?  If you do then here is what you need to do.<br>  <br>  1.  Make him sever all contact with this woman<br>  2.  Marriage counseling<br>  3  Talk, Talk, Talk - communication is fundamental<br>  4. Find a way to forgive him, but never, never ever forget!<br>  <br>  If you don't think you can live with this, then you already know what you need to do.  It isn't easy and I don't envy your situation.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Once he's tasted the candy, he won't stop.<br>  <br>  Sorry you had a kid with him!|`|vFCva8R5aa	At this point what can you really do besides keeping him tied up in the basement? <br>  <br>  I don't suggest that though.<br>  <br>  He will choose what he wants with his life and in all honesty you have no control over what he chooses..|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Its because youre his first girl. He feels like he doesnt have enough experience, so he wants to try something new. All guys do this and eventaully they come back to the only girl that loved them. But... hes suppose to be your husband. Its sounds like you are putting up with this. Its got to stop. If I were you, I would kick him out, lock him out, and let him go do what he wants. If he loves you, hell come back. I know its hard to seperate, but its the only way youll know.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Sounds like he falls in love every time his pee pee touches a woman! He's an immature cheater and can't be trusted to leave town, leave him!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Why stay with a cheater? Take your daughter and move on. There are good men out there. Don't wait around for him to make the decision - make it for him.|`|8mLXkmOhaa	Well I was in the same situation as you and forgave my husband of having an affair with another woman and he continue to see her behind my back for years. He fell in love with her and couldn't make up his mind of being with me or her for years, until I found out he was sleeping with both of us again I made up my mind, I asked him who did he love? he said "me" but continue to see her, well finally after 4 years of cheating and him always running to her instead of coming home with our daughter and I. I realized that he loved her, enough to choose her over us so I let him go. I got my stuff and left. If he doesn't love you or cannot make up his mind, why would you want to stay? you are better than that and you and you're baby deserve the best. Is not healthy for you and or you're baby, trust me. Is going to hurt and you will be down, but in the end it will all be worth it.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Honestly, I would divorce him, take him for half of everything and alimony. This isn't going to get better. He will probably end up leaving you. It isn't fair to you or your baby. I am truly sorry this is happening to you. What he did is adultery and that is very frowned upon in the court system. Best of luck|`|6q86rICnaa	Move on, your marriage is over and you are still young. He isn't good enough for you anyway, why waste your time. And remember, looking good mixed with I don't give a hoot is really the best revenge!!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	why would you want to stay with someone who just cheated and told you he's not sure he still loves you?<br>  But hey, if your into being miserable go for it.|`|DRvsdz1xaa	You also have to think about your child, and realize what is best for him/her.
AA10065812	I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Okay, I got bad news and really bad news for you, but first, you may not have slept with her.<br>  <br>  If she gave you a ********, she could have impregnated herself with it.<br>  <br>  You also could have had sex with someone else, using a condom, and she used it to impregnate herself.  But, in those cases, they always file as soon as they have the child.<br>  <br>  That's the bad news.  The really bad news is the yes, you can be hit with 15 years of retroactive child support.  Federal law allows for up to 18 years, but states like Michigan goes to 23 years.  Many states have shorter limits, like Missouri and Kansas, which has a five year limit, PROVIDED she was not on Welfare for the previous years.  If she was, they have the power to override the limits.<br>  <br>  I can tell you about retroactive child support cases that can curl your hair.<br>  <br>  There has been judges who have ruled on lesser or no retroactive amounts, but you need to be prepared to make a case on it.  If she now has any resources, you may be able to sue her for alienation of affection from being denied contact with your child for 15 years.<br>  <br>  You will need to interview several attorneys to find one that fits your needs best.  Also, unless the child lives in Arizona or California, you have NO LEGAL rights to the child, even while paying child support.  That is a separate filing.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|bO2rzfISaa	Here are my thoughts: you aren't very good at using birth contol. DNA tests aren't wrong. She probably couldn't FIND you. You aren't handling this in a respectable fashion.|`|GvamTVqAaa	All I can say is get a VERY good lawyer.  You're going to need it.  Make sure there is not someone else listed on the birth certificate - if there is then technically he is the father, and not you know matter what the paternity tests say.<br>  <br>  My husband's son is not biologically his, but in every other way he is.  We pay child support willingly, have joint custody, etc and he in on the birth certificate.  The actual father could never come back and claim the child nor could the mother randomly want anything from him such as child support.  This guy never "formally" gave up his rights, just never came around.|`|PhTKb3JUaa	I don't see how when you were no part of the upbringing (by no choice of your own) that you can be responsible for supporting the kid now.  If you CHOSE not to be a part of the kids life, then that would be different.  You should easily be able to challenge this.<br>  <br>  AND, at least he's close to 18 now...|`|gmaCvh00aa	You need a lawyer, but if you fathered the kid, you have to pay and you should.  Sex makes babies, pretty basic stuff.<br>  <br>  Courts don't make up false lab results just to get someone to pay--life is not TV world, so don't make up dumb scenarios in your head.  You need a lawyer to verify the lab results, and also to make sure you don't pay too much, taking into consideration the kids you already are supporting.  Something probably prompted her to go after the support.  It's only for three years, though, till the kid is 18, and she can't get retroactive support if she never asked for it before. <br>  <br>  Be comforted that this also happened to Paul McCartney a few years ago.  A woman in Germany who he slept with while on tour turned up with a teenage daughter and said he was the father.  He said he wasn't but would support the girl anyway--kind of lame, since she looked EXACTLY like him.<br>  <br>  If you try to weasel out of this, change are karma will come back and bite you in the ***.  You might need a kidney and this child will be the only matching donor.|`|wpi36XBAaa	If the DNA came back that you are the Dad, you must have slept with her, and the child IS yours. DNA doesn't lie. <br>  No, the courts don't make up these things just to trap men into paying for kids that aren't thiers. <br>  Be glad that she hasn't made a claim until now. You've had 14 years of non-payment, and so have been able to live your life as you have. You now have 3 children to care for. <br>  If not knowing them is a problem, you are also entitled to ask for visitation, if your son/daughter is also willing to find out who their father is.|`|5veU5nSwaa	You will have to fill out a financial affadavit stating your income, monthly expenses and yes your other 2 children will be considered and they will set a monthly payment amount however - chances are you will also have to pay back support for the last 15 years.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	get a good lawyer is the best advice you could follow right now.<br>  <br>  You're gonna get cleaned out, especially if that kid is planning on college.<br>  <br>  Take all your money out of the bank and store it in cash...you're gonna need once they start garnishing your wages.<br>  <br>  Always wear a rubber|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Sounds like a SCAM to me have a lawyer take a look before you send any money and if you really think the test was wrong retest!|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	fathersrights.com<br>  or<br>  fathersunted.com<br>  <br>  <br>  it still your flesh, <br>  <br>  good luck bro|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Unfortunately, theres not alot you can do here especially since the paternity test was positive and no the courts dont look for a scapegoat in these cases.The best you can hope for is she doesnt go for back support for those 15 years. Its really hard to say if the courts will consider your two kids when considering the support amount as every Judge is different thus decides differently even though they do have strict guidelines to go by. Theres not much you can say either as everything pretty much speaks for itself here. Just pray that the Judge is having a really great day when your cae comes up. Good luck|`|hY6zcQozaa	First off get a lawyer, from my experience in New York at the time, they only can take back pay from the date the summons was issued, so in other words, I didn't have to pay those past years in child support, i only had to pay til my child hit 21.  Child support i believe is 17% of your annual income and i don't believe they take into consideration how many other kids u have, but i may be wrong on that.<br>  And yes get your own paternity test done.|`|jBigEy0Caa	What a nasty woman to keep your child from you all this time and now conveniently come into your life once he/she is 15 yrs old.  I would get a lawyer right off the bat, and never turn your pay stubs, etc. into the child support office without consulting an attorney.  Child support can be negotiated by the mother and she needs to prove her income too.  They will take into consideration your other kids, if she doesn't have any more.  The last thing is you need to set up a time when you can meet your child.  You have a right to be a part of his/her life and there are people who re-unite with their kids later on who have wonderful relationships.  Hang in there and you will work through this, just stay strong.|`|mldo1vxYaa	They are not strangers, you might not know them but one of them is YOUR CHILD. Just as much as your other two children and that child deserves the same your two other children get, yes she should have told you but having unprotected sex will bring that risk.<br>  <br>  Its usually 50 a week depending on where you live, but as you havent paid anything and the child is 15 now you will be expected to pay back child support, and no the tests are not wrong, there is like .1% chance te test is wrong.<br>  <br>  The courts will take into account your current financial situation aswell as the fact you have two children but if you live with the mother they will probably take that into consideration also, you are going to have to pay either way so I would just get on with it and stop trying to get out of it. He or she is your child and deserves to have your support, they have already missed out on having a father.|`|VsqHIoJYaa	well i've read some of this advice and i agree get an attorney every state and every judge is different in how they perceive  the law|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	GET A GOOD LAWYER!!!|`|jLKcuMNraa	make sure its not a scam because thats odd that she would try to find you after 15 years|`|8cst0pt4aa	First of all, I would make sure you are not getting scammed somehow.  You really should get a lawyer involved to go over all documentation with you, and he/she could give you the best advice.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that this is ridiculous, after 15 years she never contacted you and now I guess all of a sudden she must need money so she is going to try to get some out of you.  I would not pay if I were you.  She did not let you see the kid all these years.  If you sign over your rights you don't have to pay child support.  If you DO decide to pay, you can go to court to get visitation if you want to start seeing the kid.  I mean, if he/she if 15, you would only have to pay for 3 years anyway.<br>  <br>  I would just get a lawyer, that would be the best thing for you to do.  Best of luck to you.|`|nlmkQeinaa	I looked this up because my husband might have had a daughter before we were even together and the mother would never let my husband take a test. Anyway, I thought I remembered reading that after a period of time it's too long to ask. What state are you in? Why did you take the test? Did you have to? That doesn't matter now, just curious. Are they going to ask for back child support? See if you can find a free legal advisor. That just stinks that you didn't get a chance to bond with the child and now you have to pay when it's like the mother didn't care enough for you to have a relationship. That's sad.
