I either see things about Japan being totally racist or totally accepting so I'm not sure what to believe. I'm mixed Armenian, black African, Eastern Slavic and Scandinavian. My dad is going to work in Japan so I'm gonna go with him. I was wondering what Japanese would think of my race. I've been told by my cousins in Japan that usually only European and Eurasian are the "popular" races. Is that true? Are there a lot of people with my heritage in Japan? Please post info. From a physical view, my skin can get pretty light (watch out Nicole Kidman) or pretty dark. A lot of people have mistaken me for a mixed Hawaiian when my hair is black and my skin is darker only I have blue eyes. If I'm pale and because my eyes slant, I've been thought of as Eastern Asian before (even my neighbors from Korea asked me thought I was at least half). Just to give a general idea. How would my appearance be taken? Also on personal note to women (because I am a girl), how hard is it to find clothes when you're 5'8" ft and 125 pounds? I've been to Japan once before and while I was there I couldn't find a lot of clothes. Also wear can you buy bigger bras (I'm a 34DD in America so I think that's like an E or an F in Japan)? Thanks for everything.

20090220063554AAxcYCO	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Should we fly or drive to our destination?	I am taking a two-week vacation in September.  We are in Oklahoma and we plan on either driving or flying to Virginia/D.C.  We love to fly (and would choose it as our main mode of transportation if we could), but there are so many inconveniences associated with flying anymore, i.e., delays, paying for luggage, etc.  Our car is a 2000 Malibu with 174,000+ miles on it (the only thing that has gone wrong is water pump went out at about 155,000 miles, but that was an easy replacement).  It is a GREAT car.  At any rate, this will be approximately 2,400 miles round-trip, or about 38 hours' of driving time.  Should we take a chance and use the car, or should we fly?  (If we choose to drive, we are getting AAA).  Thanks in advance for your input.

20090220070227AAwhwW2	Travel;United States;New York City	Has "Old Brooklyn" entirely gone?	I was born in Flatbush and lived there until I was 12. Back then it was getting kind of sketchy, but it was still a reasonable place to live. Middle and working class, West Indian and Jewish community where people just wanted to work and raise their families. Well, I recently considered returning to Brooklyn but its begginning to look as if that old Brooklyn has vanished. East Brooklyn is crime riddled with the exception of some pockets, and who wants to live in a pocket? And of course West Brooklyn is "nice" but it also full of pretentious yuppie transplants with no roots in Brooklyn. That would be as bad as living in Manhattan. Not what I'm looking for.      Anyway my question is is that a fitting description of what Brooklyn has become? There is no middle ground left in between the above two extremes? If so I'll stay in NJersey.
