20090130143026AASvIJz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Who else has had a hectic terrible day, with sick kids and stupid pharmacies?	This is going to be a big ranting, but it has a question at the end. Promise.      Yeah, 4 out of 5 of my kids have something of the sort, Emma has whooping cough, Ryan and Sarah have the flu (like aches and pains and fever), and Hannah has whooping cough and the flu! I am the ONLY one besides my 17 year old and husband who is not sick, and i am playing nurse now since he got called away to New York for a week.       And I hate the insurance i have, or maybe its just the pharmacies where i  live because today the doctors office called to say that Hannah's test for whooping cough came back postitive and the meds were being called in, so i go to the store with my crying sick 4 year olds (can't leave them at home) and emma, jack and ryan are at school. and tell them that i need the medicine and all that jazz and they say,  "sorry we dont have that medicine today" so i call the doctor and she says that she called another pharmacy so i go drive to this other walmart and they tell me, "you cant get the whole bottle of liquid today, you have to come back every day to get it filled" and supposedly its my insurance, and it takes an hour and 40 minutes to get a z pac, well while i'm walking around walmart with my two sick kids, how stupid i know of getting them out, the elementary school calls and tells me Ryan has a 101.8 fever and i need to come get him, so i tell them i'll come at 2:30. So finally i get the medicine and pick up Ryan, but then i realize i need medicine for Ryan if he has the flu and i probably need to take him the doctor, so i call and i'm on hold ofr an hour and a half and they got him in, so i take him to the doctor with my cranky twins, and wait with all the sick kids not knowing what the hell i am catching and what my twins and son are also getting, and finally we get in and they order him meds. and i have to pick that up tonight..and i'm finally ready to go home, my son calls and says that he can't take Emma home because he is going to his friends right after school for the soccer game, but he doesn't tell Emma to get on the bus when he said he would, so Emma calls me in a scared fit that she has been left at school for the rest of her life, so i have to go pick her up, and then we get in traffic just going across the street, and FINALLY....i get home.       Wow. What a day. I am just so fed up and tired, and i hate that my kids are sick and i'm pregnant and wow. Its been a hectic day.      So anyways, that probably makes no sense and it probably sounds like a big mess, and oh, believe me, IT IS! And now the twins are napping finally, and Emma is watching tv, and Ryan is playing games and almost asleep...and its just so QUIET! Finally!       But anyways, anyone else having these problems? Any tips? What did you do today? i hopeyour day was a better day than mine!

I came on my period on the 23rd of December 2009 then me and my boyfriend had sex 2 days before the exact middle day of my cycle so i could have been ovulating (fertile) then.   Now i am 10 days late for my period and am starting to get bad headaches which i never get. My boobs are slowly starting to gte more tender and i am steadily realesing vaginal discharge.   I have also been able to taste a metallic taste in my mouth around the same time every night (8pm).   Also i never get tired in the day now as i have a very strong coffee every morning and so i'm always full of energy but today i have exhausted and short tempered.   What do you think the chances of me being pregnant are?   I took a HPT when i was 4/5 days late and it said negative bnut i only weed on it for about 2 seconds and it wasn't my first wee of the day so wasn't completely reliable as it only contains a lot of pregnancy hormone in the morning.

I am so used to this kind of poop because she pooped like this before the solid food. And then some more today yellow poop with lots of black fibers in it... maybe it's the banana fibers...? but why black? At first I thought they were little worms.

He has come up and talked to me a couple times. He'll come up to me and be like ''Hey, How are you'' and we'll usually talk for a few minutes. He is a little shy but still pretty outgoing and i'm really shy with new people especially around him. I have caught him starting at me during one church service and he will help me at a moments notice. I can't tell if he likes me back, because he is so nice person to everyone it's hard to tell if he's just being really nice to me or if he likes me. Does he like me or is he just being nice? How do i tell if he likes me back?

20090130155249AALGtfG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Rhesus Negative blood group worries!!!!!?	Iam 7 weeks pregnant. Iam O negative and my partner is AB positive.    My daughter is O positive, and i remember getting all the relevant anti-d jags before and after she was born and all was fine.     However since then i have had a couple of early miscarriages. One complete one at 5 weeks and another one which required surgery at 9 weeks.    Now Iam terrified that i will have started producing antibodies against my current pregnancy. I found an old letter from the surgical m/c which states "(my name)'s rhesus status has been checked and anti-d will be administered if appropriate" I cannot remember if i got the anti-d or not after the miscarriages.     This is why iam scared. I would appreciate advice from anyone who has had a doctor or midwife tell them about this.     Also, is there any way i can ask my doctor to go back and check if i have had the anti-d? will it be in my records?    thanks x

20090130164228AAvOVQ9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mom/daughter challenge, she said I lost?	I had an argument with my mom about something, and I stupidly said that I didn't need her to do anything for me.  So she set up this stupid challenge, that she wouldn't do a single thing for me over the next week, and if I could survive without complaining or asking her to do anything for me, than she'd buy me anything I wanted.  Well ok I was fine for like the first 2 days, but we ran out of food, and she didn't buy anything for the fridge, and I had no money to go out to get food.  So I asked her to cook me something, and than she said that I lost the challenge because I asked her to do something for me.  Well that's not even fair at all, I mean come on I was starving.  I feel as if that shouldn't be part of the challenge, I mean come on food is life and death here.  Do you think that's unfair or do you think I lost the challenge fair and square?  OMG I was gonna have her buy me a new phone too, this is totally not fair at all.
20090130170648AA2VeIE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	30 weeks pregnant with an a@#hole's baby?	I was wondering if anyone has gone through the same thing.  I'm 30 weeks pregnant with my third child.  After I was pregnant with my first child, I gained weight from quitting smoking and the only food that seemed to stay down was something fatty (I don't know why that was the case).  My "fiance" (I quote it because I don't feel like he really is that to me) got embarrassed of me and treated me like I was shameful.  For example:  We went fishing together ( he was fishing and I just watched him, oh what fun!) and his favorite lore got caught on a rock in the middle of a lake.  He was bummed so I swam out and got it.  I came back up drentched and I apparently wasn't attractive enough to stand next to him anymore, because he walked away from me and said "I don't know you, don't come near me".  I think the only other people that saw me were two old men.  We stopped going places together and I knew I gained some weight while I was pregnant, but it justified the fact that I didn't have my same figure anymore.  After I had my first child, I was the primary caretaker and he went to work to support our new family and only played video games when he got home and didn't want to spend time with any of us.  3 months after, I got pregnant with my second child.  He told his mom that I pressured him into doing it and this made me feel like he wasn't proud to say he was having another baby.  I didn't get much support of anything from him for either pregnancy and I started getting really upset from here on out because I felt trapped.  6 months after I had my second child, I was pregnant with my third baby and now I'm 30 weeks along.  The sex is only twice a month, he plays online games and doesn't pay attention to the kids he has and I still don't receive any support.  He only wants to go to prenatal visits if they are ultrasounds or if I'm going to give birth.  To add to everything, he is a big baby.  He got mad because I only made the kids something to eat and not him and kept saying to the kids "I bet you have a full belly".  I keep trying to leave him, but I have no where else to go.  My credit got messed up from identity theft and now I can't qualify for any places around here without clearing up my records which is impossible to do apparently.        Can someone give me advice on what to do?  I don't want to be with him anymore and I have no where else to go. He's a ******** and I want a real man in my life that will acknowledge me and give me credit for what I do.  I got to college while having small children in diapers which isn't easy to do, but he told me I was on "vacation" because I didn't work.  When I finally got part time jobs, he made me quit them because it was cutting into his social life and hunting time (which he has no social life and hasn't hunted in two years).  Even a full time job working 16 overtime each week wasn't good enough for him and made me feel guilty for "leaving my kids".  I can never win with this man.  I also want to have a natural birth because both of my kids were c-sections and he thinks I'm going to be stretched out for sex.  I'm torn, fed up, and I don't know what to do...I need advice!! Please Help!!

20090130154119AAlGfLL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Blood pressure question at 36 weeks pregnant?	Two weeks ago my doctor notified me that my blood pressure was slightly high compared to past visits at 130/90. They checked it again  last Monday and it was still slightly high. I went back yesterday and my blood pressure was lower but I also had the day off do to the weather so i am wondering if my day off had something to do with the lower bp. They did say that I had protein in my urine. They said if I start to swell or have a headache or blurred vision then to call the office. I was talking to someone today about the high blood pressure and she asked if I had been seeing stars. I had recently been seeing stars and I never thought about the stars being one of the symptoms. I am trying to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this. My doctor said on Monday that I would have to go on bed rest if I get worse. I saw a nurse practitioner yesterday who seemed less concerned. Any help please. Im trying to finish up the next two weeks of work but my health and babies health are of course more important. Thanks for your help!

I had an appointment today and had an internal and my midwife said that my cervix is still closed, but soft and facing out.  What does she mean when she says facing out?  I didn't even think to ask when I was there I was too anxious wondering what was going on because I had an ultrasound done earlier and saw my baby boy in 3D!  It was soooo cool and he is so chubby lol.  He measured to be 7lbs 12 ounces and of course that could go a pound either way, but the tech kept saying how "meaty" he was.  When she was looking at his bone (in his leg for example) you could just see how much fat or whatever was surrounding it.  So my midwife said they will schedule and induction if I make it to my Feb. 6 appointment so I am hoping I go before than on my own.  Anyway again this was really to find out what it meant when my cervix was facing out lol.

I went to the restroom this morning and I only peed a little bit, but it was tinted LIGHT LIGHT pink and when I wiped it was LIGHT LIGHT pink but just a tiny bit. I waited about 15 minutes and peed a checked again normal color urine and nothing when I wiped but I had two almost penny sized spots of blood in my underwear I took some toliet paper to it and not much came up at all and it was brownish, nothing close to red. Now I just went back for a third time and in my panty liner and there was a little bit of brown, not much. and I peed a lot and there was nothing but then when I wiped it was a mix of brown and pink. ALL OF THIS IS WITH CRAMPING, but not as strong as a period cramp.  Now throughout the day I haven't had much on a pad at all and the stuff on it looks brown, we I urinate there is blood and when I wipe its a light red color. NOTHING as heavy as a period at all but I have been having really bad cramps. Don't give me any grief please but I can't get to a doctor one because its the weekend and I can't go to the hospital because I am only a teenager and I don't want to tell my parents until I'm pretty far along so that I don't have them hate me and then lose the baby.

20090130180944AA8YRdI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Why did teen pregnancy become so stigmatized?	I don't entirely understand how that happened... why people often automatically think a mother should consider placing her baby for adoption because of her age?      Both of my grandmothers had babies before they turned 20. They were both married, and I understand why unwed pregnancy became stigmatized, but no one blinked at these women's age. They were from totally different cultures, but no one in either culture questioned their "teen pregnancies." For most of history, this was the case.      So what exactly changed? When did the teen years become "too young"?       Is it because age of marriage has gotten later, and teens are now assumed to be unwed-- so it's really an unmarried thing? Is it because college/university education has become a basic requirement for more and more jobs, and it's assumed a mother can't get an education? Is it because people are more and more considering adolescence a unique stage of life, whereas for much of history the world was pretty much considered to be divided into children and adults?      Why are teens considered too young to parent? Why are they often pressured/expected to give their children up for adoption? When did the distinction start to be drawn between single mothers based on age, and why is that the cutoff point?      Thoughts?

20090130182640AAl95VC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you do this to your child?	My dad dumped me off with my grandparents when I was just an infant.  He'd rather be in the army.  So my grandparents are my parents in a way.        Growing up he ignored my birthdays because having me killed my mother.  So I got punished every year on my birthday.  Holidays, he hardly came.  This past Christmas was the first one I remember with him being there.      And now he thinks he has the right to be in my life.  He calls me several times a day after just throwing me away.  He tries to come over for dinner once a week when I used to not see him but maybe once or twice a month.      I guess what I'm asking is would you parents throw out your child and then act like everything is fine and dandy after several years of not being there?

Me and my boyfriend are moving into a house together, and I would like to get a part time job to help pay bills. I really did not want to go to school online, but I don't really know how easy it would be to find an at home job for a 17 year old with no experience. Does anyone know what would be the better choice? Should I still go to school and try and find a job at home? Or should I find a way to go to school part time and work part time so I don't have to do anything at home? I am trying to make the best decision for my baby. I refuse to give up school completely, because I know that would be an obvious mistake. Also, my mom and mother in law both offered to watch the baby whenever I need them to, so I don't have to worry about paying for  day care. Is there anyone who has been in the same position as me or a similar one? What worked for you?

I am going to a new school soon and she will also be going, and taking the same classes. So that's a guaranteed friend, which I need.       But her actions lately have made me really MAD. See we both started out as the kind of girls that would do whatever to succeed. Cheating, Lying, Stealing, Whatever it took. Now I'm getting off that road, and she's getting further in.       Mostly the problem is that she is SELFISH. If it doesn't better her, she doesn't care. For example: We both (get this) are honor society members. We have service projects we can lead. SHE LEADS ONE!      Her: "I could care less about my cause, I'm just doing it to get out of class."   Me: "Oh..um..Well I'm thinking of starting one to raise money for pediatric cancer research."   Her: You Have to put me on your team!"   Me: I think you;re busy enough anyway... (avoids truth)   Her: No just put me on the team so it will make my resume look good. I mean, I don't really even care about the kids with cancer anyways because no one in my family has had cancer.   Me: (pissed) I GRG.       SHE KNOWS DARN WELL MY SISTER PASSES AWAY FROM CANCER NOT SO LONG AGO. HOW DARE SHE BE SO INSENSITIVE!!      Anyways, any help is appreciated. I don't even know what to do with my suppose friend...       10 points to best answer. Thanks!!!

20090130201618AA3lPek	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think you'll live up to your word?	Lets be honest, we all love to give advice that's pretty clear cut, but how often do we follow that advice for ourselves?  Anytime a woman mentions her husband/boyfriend cheated on her, everyone yells out leave him!  but the reality is, half of those same people probably wouldn't do that if it was them in that situation.  It's much easier to tell someone what to do then it is to do it ourselves.  So what about our advice about children,  not letting grown children sponge of us and making them get a job or move out, not fixing all of your child's problems, always following through with your threats etc.  Are you really following that advice or think you will when it applies to you? or do you think you will end up being a softie in the end?

20090130203348AAMZIfB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mother's that had a REALLY bad pregnancy (long, please read)?	I was born with severe pulmonary stonosis (bad heart). Because of that I was told that I would never have babies. (Didn't ovulate) Then at the age of 24 I had a pace maker put in. This got my heart beating and working as it should. (started ovulating). I got pregnant after about a year of trying. When I went to my cardiologist's office to tell him that I was pregnant, he told me (very nicely) not to get my hopes up too high, that woman with hearts as bad as mine were rarely able to stay pregnant, and the ones who did, always had their babies early. (my little man was coming at 28 weeks, but I'll get to that a little later). He got me in touch with a group of very good high risk OBGYNs. They took very good care, and kept an extra close watch on me.       I ended up with GD, and colistasious of pregnancy on top of my heart. Because of this I had to have non-stress tests 3 times a week. It was during one of these that they found out I was contracting. (I was 28 weeks along). I went to the hospital and found out I was already 5cm dilated and 100% effaced. They kept me there on bed rest and had me on magnesium sulfate to try and keep me pregnant. I was on total bed rest, no shower, no toilet. Sponge baths and bed pans (oh my!).      At 31 weeks my water broke even with the Mag, and I delivered naturally.

20090130210555AAFVTaL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mother's that had a really bad pregnancy (long, please read)?	I was born with severe pulmonary stonosis (bad heart). Because of that I was told that I would never have babies. (Didn't ovulate) Then at the age of 24 I had a pace maker put in. This got my heart beating and working as it should. (started ovulating). I got pregnant after about a year of trying. When I went to my cardiologist's office to tell him that I was pregnant, he told me (very nicely) not to get my hopes up too high, that woman with hearts as bad as mine were rarely able to stay pregnant, and the ones who did, always had their babies early. (my little man was coming at 28 weeks, but I'll get to that a little later). He got me in touch with a group of very good high risk OBGYNs. They took very good care, and kept an extra close watch on me.       I ended up with GD, and colistasious of pregnancy on top of my heart. Because of this I had to have non-stress tests 3 times a week. It was during one of these that they found out I was contracting. (I was 28 weeks along). I went to the hospital and found out I was already 5cm dilated and 100% effaced. They kept me there on bed rest and had me on magnesium sulfate to try and keep me pregnant. I was on total bed rest, no shower, no toilet. Sponge baths and bed pans (oh my!).      At 31 weeks my water broke even with the Mag, and I delivered naturally. He stayed in the NICU for 3 weeks and came home on Christmas Eve day. He didn't need any extra help, he was pretty much just eating and growing under the lights, lol.      When I went in for my 6 week check up, I was told that the chances of having the same pregnancy would be about 80%. I was also told this by my cardiologist.

I keep reading all these answers where mommies are talking about how their little one hates it.  My daughter just sits there and smiles when I do it lol.  Sometimes it "gets her breath", but she doesn't mind.  She has always been this way.  So could your little one care less?  Or do they hate it?       Just a question out of curiosity - I'm really bored lol.... =)      **She is 6 months btw.
20090130210106AAUyjN0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Fifteen year old sleepover party, need ideas and help ASAP?	Hey everyone,   Alright, so tomorrow I'm having four friends over and were having a slumber party/sleepover type of thing. I'm really excited. There isn't going to be any drugs, boys or alcohol, it's just going to be a fun night just of us girls hanging out. I'm doing a gift card exchange, were having a bunch of snacks, were playing air hockey, listening to music, watching movies and doing up-do's and make-up... But I need some more ideas. Also, is it lame having a slumber party at the age of fifteen that doesn't have drugs, boys or alcohol? I ask this because one of the girls attending send me an e-mail on whether there was going to be alcohol, and responded by saying no. Is that stupid? Is this too little kid like? I thought it would be fun, but I'm starting to wonder if it's age-appropriate. Also, what other fun things can we all do. Game suggestions would be fun. I would like to make this super fun, and not totally lame.       Thanks.      Please star, I really need some ideas... Also, all games and ideas are acceptable, just please help me out. Thanks in advance. =)

20090130204822AAieaMR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I try not to but every time I see this girl I basically swoon?	I met a girl through friends over the summer and immediately was smitten. It was just an innocent crush and I've had far too many of those (and being a girl liking a girl doesn't make it easier) so I try to forget about it. The way we know each other through friends is one of those 'small world' kind of things, so we talked a lot to each other marveling over it for a few months, on Facebook. She got my number from someone, and we started texting. We hung out a second time with a group of friends, but this time I didn't make a very good impression - but she didn't think anything bad about me even after it. Every chance she gets she texts me or calls me or leaves me Facebook messages and she 'poked' me on Facebook, too. I was thrilled at the time, but, again, I pushed this crush aside. Her chattiness hasn't worn off. Each time she texts me is a new thrill. I can't understand why she does this.      I saw her tonight for the third time since summer but this time I gave her a better impression - I was outgoing and bubbly and I could tell she liked it much more than the last time. The moment she saw me (we went to a concert of hers, and afterwards she came out from behind the stage to greet everyone) she squealed my name and gave me a hug - before she even said hi to her friends. During the whole concert I just adored her and I almost don't WANT to because I know it will end badly. We talked for a half hour afterwards, close-talking (I'm a close talker) and always touching...our hands, our arms. I don't think I lost physical contact with her for a whole half hour, but neither did she. I'm so confused and I know I should ask her but I just can't and I don't know what to do. What do you think?

20090130210504AA3G1L6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Are the baby names you like now the same as the names you liked 10 or more years ago?	I was just thinking about this today, as my husband and I were talking about having another baby. When I got pregnant with my first son in 1996 at age 19, I liked these names:      BOYS   Drew McKenzie   Grant Washington (Washington was my great grandpa) - used this one btw   Colby Jordan         GIRL   Alexis Michaela   Audrey Loretta (Loretta was my b/f's grandmother)   Morgan Alexis      I don't really like those names anymore. Alexis became too popular back then, so I decided against that early on. But when I got pregnant with my daughter is 2004, I still kind of liked that name. We ended up naming our daughter Alexandria Chase. (Chase after her brother that passed away in 2001.)      When I got pregnant with my second daughter in 2007, my taste in names had changed quite a bit. We named her Alaina Vivian. (Vivian after my grandmother.)      My taste in names now I think is very different from what is was back in 1996. I am also 32 now, so that may make a difference in how I think. The names we have chosen now for another child are:      BOYS   Emmett Doran (Doran after my husband)   Evan Dean (Dean after my Uncle)      GIRLS   Evelyn Genevieve (Genevieve is my name and my grandma's name)   Layla Evonne (Evonne after my best friend of 15 years.)      So, I was just wondering how everyone else's tastes have changed. Do you remember what names you liked 10 years ago or more?

Today she had a BM that was hard...kinda like how ours (adults) is. Is this normal or does it mean she was constipated? Been told the firmer the poop means constipation. This was her first BM in 2 days.    She's breast and formula fed. She seems uncomfortable, squirming alot, having a hard time passing gas. I've tried Ovol (like Mylicon). Also have tried gripe water (not together with the Ovol, of course). I've pedalled her legs and rubbed her, etc etc. Nothing seems to do the trick. Any tips?    Thank you.

I told my mom about our relationship since day one so she knows pretty much everything about him. They seam to get along really well. She told me if we start to have sex she wants me to tell her so she can take me to get Birth Control. My mom and I are like best friends and I feel I can talk to her about almost anything but for some reason this subject I can't. I'm just a little worried when I do tell her she will be a little disappointed in me because she is really religious. She's the one who brought up this whole subject in the first place though. My boyfriend and I are more than a hundred percent sure we're ready to take our relationship to the next level. We've talked this over with eachother about a million times and he thinks it's a very sensible decision for me to use Birth Control. I just wanted to know what some of you think is the best way for me to bring the subject of me wanting Birth Control up to my mom? Also what Birth Control do you think is the most used or the best for more protection? Some people have told me Yaz is good. My boyfriend is also a virgin. We're both not really nervous but excited. Is that normal to feel that way your first time? The more I think about us having sex I get nervous though. Is their anything we can do to help with the nerves? Please don't judge me because I'm just asking a simple question. Thank you to everyone who answers in advanced.         -Caitlin.

It's actually a Hebrew name, meaning peace.   We would like to use it as a girl name but we also want to use Cole as the middle name. Is that too masculine together?

He is under just under 40 lbs so he is in a forward facing car seat with the harness restraint.  When we convert to booster seat, he will have to sit either behind the driver or behind the passenger where there is a full, shoulder seat belt.

20090130203938AAed4xy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please HELP!! Amniotic Band?!?!?	Please help!!! I know I just posted a question about this a few hours ago, but I am dying!!! I can't sleep & I'm full of worry!!       I went to my 32 week appointment yesterday & was informed @ my last u/s, which was 20 weeks (btw), that there appears to be an amniotic band on the lower part of the sac, not touching the baby. My midwife couldn't give me much info. on it, so I OF COURSE came home & googled it & actually learned a lot about something that I have never even heard of. I received another phone call today, saying that it may not even be an amniotic band, but could be something else... in which she couldn't tell me, because she didn't know or remember the name of it, when it was told to her... (GREAT doc I have, huh?).       Anyway, what it may be is something not quite as bad as having an amniotic band in there. I was wondering if anyone has experienced this before & what else it could possibly be. I did see that there was also something called a amniotic sheet, but I'm pretty sure if that's what it was my doc would have known that & would have been able to tell me. She made it seem like it was something she had never heard of.       I have another u/s scheduled for Wed. to find out what is going on in there, but considering that is 5 LONG days away, I thought I would try here.       Any info. would be GREATLY appreciated!!!!!

20090130200637AA2xdaz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How come all college movies are booze and sex?	Honestly, the most realistic movie about college life from the last 10 years that I can think of is Spider-Man 2. Peter Parker spends his time trying to get good grades instead of getting boozed up and exposing himself to herpes, which is what people who actually succeed in college are like. People who go to college for the parties are the ones who flunk out because they never study and their grades are crap.
