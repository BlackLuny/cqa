LnYr2dLfaa	Fallout 3 is probably one of the best shooter games I've ever played.    There is also Fable 1, Gears of War 1 and a number of other Call of Duty games if you don't like Fallout 3, so it's probably best to hire it or borrow it off someone before you spend your money.|`|4er9SBgWaa	I think you'd enjoy it a great deal.  it can be played as a fps or in third person (tho third person is a little clunky), it has a good story, depth of character, diversity in quests, weapons, equipment, skills/stats etc.  It's a well put together game and, no, I won't tell you the story because I don't want to spoil it.  It's worth buying.  defo.      pax

Microsoft make Xbox and Nintendo make Wii. There is also Sony who have playstation.    A wii will play Wii games (obviously) but also gamecube games (but you will need to buy a gamecube controller to play those games.)    Go easy on him you lot he obvioulsy doesn't know the first thing about games. Not everyone with a wii is a gamer.    Since you sound new to games and you have a wii  I recommend you get mario galaxy, metroid prime 3 and twilight princess if you dont have them the 3 best games on wii.   If you really want to play an xbox game then buy the original xbox as well they are pretty old now so you can pick one up very cheaply on ebay or something, if you do that then the best games on xbox are Fable,Halo and Halo 2.|`|AA12121752	No they will not.

wyvSAhtZaa	All roller coasters manufactured by Arrow (Vortex, Great American Scream Machine, etc) are rough. To prevent extreme head banging, hold your head tight to one side of the shoulder harness. Hold on with your hands to the top of the harness (close to your head, for extra cushioning), rather than on the front of the harness. Going into the inversions (loops) is the worst part. Also, the front is generally the smoothest end of the train.    Once you ride it a few times, you'll get used to it.|`|o3YyTqxFaa	On Vortex, I always stick my head out in front of the harness so my head can't bang back and forth. Other than the head banging, I find it to be a very enjoyable coaster.    Also, I feel the need to point out that if you are in fact going to go to "PKI" this summer, you are going to need a machine to travel back in time.  :) Cedar Fair bought Kings Island a few seasons ago.

vtJDHJDYaa	Marluxia is too difficult to really describe a strategy, so I'll just list his  attacks;    1. Marluxia will cast his scythe upwards, the screen will turn dark, and a scythe-shaped bolt will come downwards. The chance to dodge it should be taken by rolling just as soon as he swings his scythe but before the screen turns dark.    2. Marluxia will use a combo known as "Blossom Shower". There appears to be no way to dodge this attack, so you'll have to use 0 value cards to break it before Marluxia can cast it.    3. Marluxia will swing his scythe and a pink outline of a scythe will float in the direction he swung his scythe.    4. Marluxia will move forward ever-so-slightly after swinging his scythe, and time slows down for a second. Even if you do take damage from this hit, you'll only be able to tell by your health bar.    5. Marluxia will use attack  1, but repeatedly (Yes, it is a different attack)  Marluxia is REALLY DIFFICULT, so watch out for him.    This battle requires four different types of cards; the most powerful Keys that you have in your armament, as many Cloud cards as you can fit, at least one Megalixir, and the always-useful Cure.    But seriously, Marluxia II (Or "Marluxia on a giant mech") is vast, but I'll try to do the best I can. First, start off by destroying Marluxia's swords. Once that's done, continue by destroying Marluxia's arms with your Keys and stop his attacks when necessary with 0 value Keys, and once they are destroyed and you get on top, use the Cloud summon cards. Without the use of any combos or sleights, and repeating this over and over, it should in the end allow you to defeat Marluxia II.    I lost all of the cures except one (8) before the arms were off, and I only had one cloud (3) when the arms were off. The trick is to break everything he plays, and to make sure that you are beside the arms whenever you break the card. That destroys them (eventualy). You need to save your clouds until later, but go ahead and use the cures until you only have one left (hopefully the 8).    At first he'll start to jump up and down with that needle thing, but after you break it twice, he'll fly down beside you. Then he'll summon three flowers. WAIT UNTIL after HE ATTACKS with the petals, and break them. That makes them dissapear. After all three are gone, he'll fly to the left of you, and give you a chance to attack. Then he'll do some other attack, which you should break. Then jump on the back of the machine. He'll summon the petals again, and just destroy them as described above. Then just flog him with Cloud cards, just make sure not to fly off.    If you need to call your cards back, do one number at a time, make sure you're right beside him. It takes a LONG time (took me about 30-45 minutes) but if you have that one cure (the 8), then use it when he tries to attack you from the bottom of the machine. An 8 card is the most powerful one he'll use (unless you count 0) after you break the arms."|`|ZGj4ww9jaa	ign.com should work at a school computer cause im in school and its working|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use.

Q5gxghVqaa	For PS2, I just recently picked up Maximo Vs Army of Zin.  I beat it in a few days not playing more than 2 hours at a time.  It's really fun. A Capcom arcade-like action platform game.  Also, you can never get enough of Ratchet and Clank (first 3 games on PS2), as well as the first Jak and Daxter game.  The next 2 Jak games up the diffuculty exponetially.  Later if you move onto PS3, you have to play Uncharted and Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Distruction.|`|LnYr2dLfaa	PS2 titles:  Ratchet & Clank 3  Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2  Scaler  Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock  GTA: San Andreas  Resident Evil 4    Wii titles:  Super Mario Galaxy  Super Smash Bros Brawl  Metroid Prime 3  Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess  Trauma Center: New Blood|`|SJrq8Bl4aa	um PS2 games for a 14 year old, if you want to buy DDR(dance dance revolution) mats thats a great game. there is also Kingdome hearts, 1 and 2, plus chain of memories. KH is adicting, but you can always stop. The .hack series, and .hack//GU series is great. None of these are very violent. Then some semi more violent, but still appropriate games are  Final Fantasy games(up to 13 i think) and lord of the rings, and harry potter games.    the last i suggest are grand theft auto games, but there is extensive violene and foul language in those. those are my favs.!    hope it helps! Kingdom hearts is the best out of these    for the WII    super mario galazy is great, as well as supermario brawl. There is also this feista game..(it has maracas, i cant remember the name) also the zelda game is time consuming. and wii sports and games.    thats all i can think of. Hope it helps|`|mqQP8Ebpaa	I would recommened The ratchet and clank games and also the Jak and Daxter games they are the best games for ps2!    and i would also consider the sypro games ^^    hope this helps

AA11850311	does he have enough friends?  If there is a 4 (+2) by the friend symbol in the career screen, that means he has 4 friends, and needs 2 more to get promoted.  He also needs to go to work in a very good mood.
xDubataIaa	Look at the pattern on the monitor. You have to use your characters to stand on the panels on the ground to re-create the pattern shown on the monitor. You have to re-create only 3 patterns and the first one is usually the toughest, as it is mostly luck.     Just keep trying to get past that first one and then the other two patterns will be easier. Just be careful not to accidentally step on a wrong panel as it will reset the puzzle back to the first pattern. Watch your step! Also, the puzzle is random which means there is no true walkthrough, just advice on how to do it.

Now you see this is what sucks about call of duty is that Activision is really greedy so they got 2 developers Treyarch and Infinity Ward so that they can have a call of duty every year so they can make a lot of money. So even though all those reviewers say your going to be playing call of duty for a long time, your most likely to get your eyes on a new call of duty. There are people playing online but not as much anymore which means you'll be going into a lot of matches that already ended which is a big time waster.

e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Stratego has been around forever.  First, you need to use your scouts effectively.  They should either find a huge person or trade for their scouts before it finds your huge people (or bombs).  Since they are the only piece that can move more than one hex, they are vital.  Another tip is to keep your spy safe.  He's the only piece that can kill the General and the best way I find to keep him safe is to keep him near the second most powerful piece on the board so that when the General takes that piece, you kill his General and still have your General on the board.  Third tip I would have is to never touch a piece that refuses to move except with a bomber or a scout.  A bomber is the only piece that deactivates the bombs and a scout dies to everything, so both of those pieces are expendible in locating bombs.  Pieces that don't move are either flags, bombs, or spies that are trying to get the General close enough to sneak attack on.  The spy pretends to be a bomb and when the General steps up near it to see if it will move, then the spy attacks.  My tip, I never surround my flag with bombs, I surround it on one side with a few bombs and the  2 guy and the spy and on the other side with the General and I also don't put my flag in the back row.  Most people think you should fight to the back row to capture the flag, but by putting it in the second or third row, it looks more like a bomb, is defendible by your 2 biggest pieces and will probably be passed up as a bomb by almost all your opponents pieces due to not being in the back row.  Last tip, look for their bombers and look hard.  If you can get all of them, then he has no way to win without risking his guys.  Bombers are more important to eliminate than the General when it comes to flag hunting, so kill them and do it as quickly as possible.    Those are my tips and I hope you win a few games with them.|`|ttcCS2EMaa	Actually  the  follishness of  inexpeience   would  have  served  you well.  The blank wall offers  brave  possibility- Obvious  Bombs  protect  strategic  groupings.  The best strategy is  to find and avoid the 1 until  you can draw and  trap it.  The Scoutas as you  will hear are invaluable  for the task of  moving to discover  the patterns  that  'may'  exist.   I once believed  Stratego  to  be  more  interesting  then Chess.   Conserve  strong[Low umbers/Higher  rank.  Don't  reveal  toooo much.   A clever  hide  strategy  or blind luck  often  wins a game.  Don't  be  too foolish.  Good Luck can  save a badly imbalanced  defense.  Discovery Discovery  Discovery.. J

6GIrW5eWaa	Perks will change by game type what works for war, or deathmatch may not work for domination or HQ or seek and destroy. You will also have different challenges that you have to complete to rank up faster. So you will change your perks or set up different custom classes based on what games you are playing. One perk that I don't change very often from class to class is stopping power. I spent the first couple of days online extremely frustrated because I would shoot what seemed like a full clip into someone and they would kill me with two shots. Once I turned this on the outcome was much different. I can't say that it was just this perk but experience online as well that helped out. Try different perks that you think will work with different game types and once you are comfortable lock them in.

Total luck.<br>  <br>  If you really want to play online bingo, check the sites carefully and get educated about their payout reliability.  Some are good, some are not.  Do your homework before you deposit.  Online message boards are good for this.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	All cards/ numbers are random.<br>  The site operator does not care who wins, because he/she earns money from each game. So the operator just wants as amny happy people playing on the site as possible.<br>  <br>  Most sites use a "randomiser" which is usually driven by the variable flow of electricity ions in the main supply. Voltage is never constant,it always varies a little, second by second, so a Randomiser takes a measurement then performs a variety of complex mathematical equations on it - then goes back to the voltage again and adds another random number to the equation.<br>  <br>  Pretty slick system, developed in S. Africa and Australia.<br>  <br>  In summary, there is no chance of any cheating an a site which uses a proper randomiser.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|0p7CMoBwaa	Bingo is pure luck, the online Bingo sites use what is called a random number generator key.

ROaxfHIIaa	Se llaman Matrioska<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|pUSe49l5aa	La matrioska o matrioskas, son unas mu?ecas tradicionales rusas creadas en 1890, cuya originalidad consiste en que se encuentran huecas por dentro, de tal manera que en su interior albergan una nueva mu?eca, y ésta a su vez a otra, y ésta a su vez otra, en un número variable que puede ir desde cinco hasta el número que se desee, aunque es raro que pasen de veinte. Se caracterizan por ser multicolores, o por la presencia de elementos decorativos en la pintura tales como jarrones o recipientes sostenidos por las mu?ecas. A veces las mu?ecas interiores son iguales entre sí, pero pueden diferenciarse en la expresión de la mu?eca o en el recipiente que sostienen. La matrioska con más mu?ecas de la que se tiene conocimiento posee 75 unidades.<br>  <br>  Hoy en día, las matrioskas son uno de los principales souvenirs solicitados por los turistas en Rusia.<br>  |`|FZ5aNq1Xaa	se llaman matrioska. tambien escuche que la llaman mamushka o algo asi. |`|FVUakZaQaa	Se llaman Matrioska o las Matrioskas|`|C8JoikfKaa	 se llaman mamuskas |`|Ug8kurq4aa	Matriuscas<br>  saluditos |`|VbukSiP2aa	Matrioshkas o Matrushkas |`|728a5015cfb080fc8739e8eabaf879b3aa	Acá, en Argentina, le dicen mamuskas.<br>  SALUDOS|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Matrioskas =)|`|RK5ebsYdaa	se llaman matruskas o matroskas que signifca madre en ruso.. algo asi..son tipicas de alla y muy hermosas pintadas a mano|`|1c6eae8c439935b861427b0e3d5c54a0aa	SE LA CONOCE DE DOS MANERAS COMO MAMUSHKAS O MATRISHKAS.|`|2d90d1a4f8274ce5b2294021e4b7cbe2aa	Matrushkas|`|BykXXaOVaa	Matrioshkas o Matrushkas

SI02JOQ4aa	On betfair (www.betfair.com - over 18's only!) Liverpool are 2/1 to finish higher than Man Utd.<br>  <br>  Man Utd are 4/11 to finish above Liverpool.|`|AA11151902	Yes, in theory you can bet on whatever you want - as long as the bookmaker is prepared to offer odds for your bet.<br>  <br>  If you cannot find bets for what you want then ask a member of staff at your local bookies. Chances are, they'll try to offer some kind of odds for you.|`|ZOCL3pO3aa	Pretty much so...if the bookie will take the bet/give you odds.<br>  For this reason smaller family run bookies might be better than the biggies.|`|tdiyhf68aa	Depends on the Bookie, most dont have the cash flow of a casino, but thats their business......you just have to ask................
63da1f2c586ef9e69acfa98f679534e2aa	7/2 means if you bet $2 on the person and they win, you will win $7 (plus your $2 back).  10 means if you bet $1, you will win $10 (plus your $1 back).|`|SI02JOQ4aa	Bookmaking odds do not use fractions, so 7/2 is simply three and a half to one.<br>  <br>  Also, when odds are "to one" such as ten to one and twenty to one, they are shown as 10 and 20.<br>  <br>  It's just tradition.|`|vm6Ig4NMaa	7/2...you bet 2...win 7 for a total of 9.  Since your wager amount will vary it will help for you to convert the odds to a decimal form.  You divide the first number by the second and then multiply by your wager amount to get your possible profit amount.  For example if you were to bet 50 on the 7/2 it would look like this....<br>  <br>  7/2 = 7 divided by 2 = 3.5 odds X 50 bet amount= 175 profit + 50 bet amount = total 225
7aff29b7fbf0ecfdd2147a496ed57e76aa	There are only 2 possibilities... once you place an accumulator bet, you are locked in, you cannot take the money 1/2 way thru the bet.<br>  so either all your choices win, and you win the accumulator, or one or more of your choices fail, and you lose.<br>  <br>  however, mathematically, as all 14 events have 3 outcomes, you have a 1 in 3^14 (4,782,969) chance<br>  |`|SI02JOQ4aa	Because there are 3 outcomes, the answer is simply to multiply 3 by 3 for 14 or 7 times.<br>  <br>  Which gives 4782969 for 14 times, and 2187 for 7 times.

Organise some poker nights with your mates or play in a pub game, atleast you can have some fun and not be donating your hard earned cash to fat millionares who dont deserve it, Think about it. |`|01K2QAydaa	you cant. you need to be 18 years old. <br>  <br>  and trust me. you will lose money quickly. unless you bet on something that you are most likely to win like football games and dont gamble on horse races |`|SI02JOQ4aa	You need to be 18 - and when you are, many will accept paypal as well as credit cards.|`|aVb80BGPaa	No,I think you need Visa, Mastercard or Switch for gambling websites!

t8FJyxdpaa	Take back $1000 and leave $200 on your account.bet $2000<br>  This way you have made a profit and are playing with there money. You will have something to show for it. You will get to make a good size wager. ( to control the itch you have. ) and if you do lose then you have a G note and still have 200 on your account to restart.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	The fact that you are thinking that you'd only be losing $110 is a problem in itself.<br>  <br>  You aren't going to count the cost of "buying" the picks at all?  You lose this bet, you are down a lot more than $110.<br>  <br>  It's up to you, if you are comfortable betting $3000 on a single football game, then go for it.<br>  <br>  I'd have pocketed profit weeks ago, but that's just me.<br>  |`|SI02JOQ4aa	This is an age-old question which is usually asked by gamblers/stock market players.<br>  <br>  The general rule of thumb when you get in this position - is to take half your profit and your original stake - and only use the remainder for further gambling. So I would draw $1600 and bet $1400.<br>  <br>  Then you will always have a bank to start again with, if you are unsuccessful on the final game.|`|wKKtuNm9aa	Go for it.  Take the over and get the pot to 6400.   
k3cmetWRaa	No, I use them all the time, and so do alot of people.<br>  <br>  The only way your account will get banned is if the mod you are using somehow allows you to do things you wouldn't normally be allowed to in the game.  Like get a mount at lvl 1. <br>  <br>  Those are considered hacks, and will not only get you banned, but could create legal action against you.<br>  <br>  Quest Helper is only a guide, it does not modify the game in any way.  So its perfectly ok by Blizzard.<br>  <br>  Other mods that are ok are map mods, or interface mods.<br>  <br>  Some good ones I use are <br>  Interface Mods: CTMOD or Titan Panel<br>  Maps: Cartographer<br>  Professions: Gatherer<br>  Questing: Quest Helper

EuVXErjJaa	To make your house larger you need to pay off your mortgage. In the town hall there is an atm like machine where you can deposit and withdrawal bells. There is also an option on that machine to pay your mortgage.

You can probably find it<br>  used at EB games or Gamestop,or on Ebay. Unless you already have it<br>  it's a great game. You choose a character (I think their are about 10) and<br>  every character is this experiment made to fight crime for "the agency"<br>  (what an original name) and you go through 3 different cities and fight three different gangs. You have to kill each of the gang bosses and as<br>  you kill each gang boss, you have a better chance of eliminating that gang's leader. I only remember one gang name and it's Los Muertos.<br>  The other two are some german gang, and a chinese or japenese gang. It's really fun, and it has online play, which you can hook up with other players in co-op, or you can just go on to highways and shoot the wheels on cars and watch them flip into the air without even<br>  hitting anything ^^|`|qIsjFmp6aa	fallout 3, tes4 oblivion, fable 2, saints row 2, left 4 dead|`|RJhhXY1Naa	here is a list of games that are under $10...<br>  <a href="http://www.revenuerobot.com/2009/15-really-cheap-xbox-360-games/" rel="nofollow">http://www.revenuerobot.com/2009/15-real...</a>|`|iRkj7Xkvaa	action shooter: gears of war    adventure rpg: fable 2|`|WqUulBJOaa	Well you didn't include RTS but the best one is coming out and I Highly Advise it.

Approach one of the two chains and notice the broken ring. Use the Precision aim to target the ring below the broken one (as shown here). Shoot the ring to break it and do the same thing with the other chain.

Also, you may want to get some rune gauntlets too as they have a bit of a defence bonus as well as a +2 str bonus to them.

tHFY2hg4aa	If everything is done right, then it has to be a problem with the download file. If other people try the file and it works fine, then find out if they have something else installed to make it work. Some downloads are patches that add on to other downloads so read the description closely.<br>  For instance, I want to download a car and see a mustang that I like. I download it and install it, but it doesn't show up in the game. Well, I went back and read and found out the download was just to change the color of the mustang. I wound up having to find the download for the actual car itself.

cMHTVMpMaa	Getting either a modchip or disc swap program may be easier than you think, especially since the site where I got them is based in Canada. Unless you have knowledge of soldering computer chips, I would recommend using Swap Magic, the most recent version being known as Swap Magic Plus 3.8. Both methods would involve opening your ps2 in some way, so that means you would void your warranty. If you have a slim ps2, just go with swap magic since that just involves opening up your ps2 to place a couple plastic pieces to make it think the ps2's still closed while swapping the discs.<br>  If you have the older, bigger model ps2's, I would just recommend getting HDLoader or HDExtreme so you can install a standard pc (or USB) hdd of any size, convert disc images to there and play games right from the hard drive.<br>  All of these can be found at www.modchip.ca. Check the model number of your ps2 as what you may need for either of the methods is dependant of that.

0brkUyGgaa	De Blob is a very unique and different game. It's somewhat unlike the above mentioned three games, as it really isn't a party-esque or multiplayer-heavy game. It can be best described as a three dimensional platform game, where players control a creature called "de Blob" to recolor the stage it is in. It is fairly fast-paced, and involves jumping and ricocheting. It's somewhat difficult, but not to the point where you cannot beat the level by becoming good at the game. It has great sound design, and special sound effects accompany each color that your de Blob spreads around - for example, when you color a building, a certain chime will come out which enhances the background music.<br>  <br>  But overall, it is very fun, and I hope you buy it.
i09pUyE4aa	every game after the first mario is a rip-off.<br>  hahaha.<br>  of course in my opinion.<br>  not that they're bad, they just... aren't as good?<br>  <br>  but i've never played the wario land shake up, so this probably doesn't help you much...<br>  <br>  <br>  and idk, i'm sixteen and i play little kids games sometimes, because they're fun, so i don't personally think you can put ages on things. like i'll play halo or call of duty or something and i'll play eh scooby doo or something kiddish.<br>  so i guess it's a personal opinion type matter.<br>  you could go to a gaming review site and watch a trailer or something or some times they put demos, as in them playing.

59Rd381caa	1. This is something to know about PS2 discs. Well, my PS2 discs are full of scratches. Just not huge ones and they still work perfect. As long as you don't get too big of scratches they'll work fine. <br>  <br>  2. BEWARE OF THE WII. My friend's Wii scratched his Super Mario Galaxy disc! (You can tell, because the scratches are deep, and they are perfect rings. Almost like saturn, where the hole in the middle is the planet, and the big scratches are the rings. If you see something like that call nintendo.<br>  <br>  3. Always put them with the part that holds the informaion on the top when you set them down on a surface. As long as you don't put something on top of the disc. That way it can't get scratched by the thing beneath it when you pick it up and put it down.<br>  <br>  4. Have you remembered the case? Put them in the case everytime. Or buy a disc holder with pages so you can flip thorugh the discs more portably and it gives them a softer surface to rest on.|`|XN0mfFYkaa	The console itself will not damage your games.

If all the Heartless are gone in Wonderland from leveling up a lot, go back to Traverse Town or the world you visited before you entered Wonderland.<br>  <br>  Or you can just restart the game from a point before choosing a card to go to a different world.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	I don't know about that since I've never tried that before. But maybe if you return to Castle Oblivion, you might get to change your destination. Just retrace your steps and use the entrance door to Wonderland as an exit to Castle Oblivion. <br>  <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/919011/34157" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvan...</a>|`|BwsTfgWaaa	Yea, your pretty much stuck there untill you finish it, just like the other kingdom hearts to an extent

59AZ4GKVaa	Hello fellow Final Fantasy player, here I am to resolve your question & hopefully get my points in return. I got my copy of FF VIII from a store called The Exchange. I would like to tell you what the story is all about, but I would be spoiling you, so good luck with that. You might find not the exact coat, but similar if you look for "aviator" coats & jackets. Anyways, for all the rest of the things that you wanna know, look them up on a search. Hope this helps ya out!!

It was originally made for teenagers and adults in Japan. But that was back when they just had the comics. When they brought it to America they decided to make it more kid friendly, so now its for kids and teenagers. But a lot of people (kids and teenagers) play the card game and watch the t.v. show. A lot of people think that it is just for kids but its not.|`|nnsqkJmTaa	I think it's more geared towards kids but it is pretty much a classic and always a fun game, so either or can really play.

mIfY1ZxMaa	Try dumping cold water on them the next time they start shouting at each other.  Maybe they need this type of wake-up call.  Are there other people on your team?  If so, get them to help.  Also, seriously think about looking for at least one alternate.  Let these two know that if they cannot work together, you will dump one of them and take the alternate instead.  They both need to work to stay on the team.  You will keep the one who is working the hardest to stay by not starting fights and not engaging when the other is pushing at them.  If one of them keeps trying to start something up and the other is doing their best to keep their cool, dump the firestarter, no matter how brilliant they are.  If their attention is taken up with browbeating a teammate, how much of it is on the competition?  And how much of your teammate's attention can be on the competition when he or she is having to watch their back?<br>  <br>  You may be quiet, but you can be strong.  And if you want to do well in the competition, you need a TEAM, not part of a team and a traveling cockfight.  Your whole team needs to understand that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!|`|5zxxQqeOaa	Tell them they both suck and tell em' to shut up.

qgk2XJpiaa	I don't think you'll find a spare Gold Lancer, they're going for nearly $30 currently on eBay.<br>  <br>  But, keep your eyes on if Microsoft screws up Xbox.com's Marketplace. They've had a glitch -- twice -- that enabled any joe schmo (me included!) to simply click and get a gold Lancer.
J1elZSMUaa	The best way to do this is to go into a private game of execution. Set the setting to have one bot player on easy difficulty. Make sure your bleed out time isn't too short. Try like 20-30 seconds. Change the weapon placement so that frags spawn every round and set 10 rounds or more. Start the game on any map that has frags. Jacinto is an easy one. Have the frags in your hands and let the computer player shoot you until you are down. When he walks over to execute you, pull the R trigger and it will blow up you and him. Do this 10 times and you will get the achievment.
kokaPSu3aa	I think you should get GTA 4 Lost and the Damned. All those other games are great, but you can rent them if you want to.

1Iyh30duaa	The highest rank is 5, most 4's cheat to get their rank by setting their routers on stand by and all rank 5's do it. You would have to be both a legendary player and extremely lucky to get to rank 5 without cheating. I'll tell you why... achieving rank 5 is hard enough but coupled with the fact that people stand by no one will ever reach that rank legitimately.<br>  <br>  The ranking system is broken anyway, i know people who have reached rank three within a few hours of playing. Your rank has alot to do with your win/loss ratio not kill/death ratio, which sucks balls if you ask me, i realise this is a team game but individual rank should be based on your individual skill as a player not your luck of getting paired up with other good players.|`|X6WAOqZOaa	your mom is the highest rank

D9zB8suoaa	i love skate2, for exactly what 609 said, it gives you such a better feel of skating and more realistic than tony hawk, in terms of gravity, speed, and the fact that its as if your in an area where you can look for skate spots gives you a better feel of what its like to be a real skateboarder, unlike in tony hawk where you can skate through the streets and find a half pipe in the middle of nowhere. the only thing i like about tony hawk games is that they sometimes have pretty cool story lines, and its much easier to do a specific trick.|`|bqpcecWXaa	easy choice... definitely get Skate 2. The Tony Hawk series is nothing compared to EA's Skate 2|`|o2xP8s1caa	Skate 2 will give you a "feel" to it. <br>  unlike tony hawk, there's always getting high air and doing all these crazy stuff. of course there's time's were Skate 2 is not all that realistic. <br>  but i seriously prefer Skate 2, it made me feel really good about skateboarding games.|`|b8046542fe552001460cfd49ef20c3e0aa	Skate 2 for sure ...i dont really love skate games but i cant stop playing

DsWgAqS8aa	The combination is random everytime you play the game..<br>  <br>  But i will give you clues!!<br>  <br>  digit 1:<br>  <br>  the clue to this number is "knowledge overflowing." its referring to the number of books in the room on the east side of the second floor. You have to look through the keyhole to count the books that are NOT on the shelves. On top of the bookcase you have to count as well if there are some up there. the clue makes sense no?<br>  <br>  digit 2:<br>  <br>  This clue is "unwelcome faces." Head to the room on the east side of the first floor. Look through the keyhole and count the number of Dorky faces inside. Take note that these faces disappear and reappear, but always are in the same place.<br>  <br>  digit 3:<br>  <br>  The clue is "tasty reminders of home." This refers to the number of Banora apples or cans in the room. be sure to look everywhere, under and behind things. Look closely for purple apples and cans they may be hard to find.<br>  <br>  digit 4:<br>  <br>  Last clue is "resting on all four feet." This is for the west side room on the first floor. Count the number of chairs in the room and that is your answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy.|`|7W5JCf4Naa	If people tell you a specific combination for this safe, DON'T BELIEVE THEM! The combo is different every single time. If you can't figure it out, you'll have to keep going back to look into those four keyholes until you get it. Remember to look in every single corner and from every single angle.

HDgdxtesaa	Go into the Pokemon Center in Jubilife City or Oreburgh (I can't remember). Talk to a person in there (I'm pretty sure he looks like a Bug Catcher) and he'll ask you if you want to change you're personality. I'm a Ruin Maniac. You can only change your character to look like certain other characters, depending on your name. (-o-) << Pokeball|`|uAMUG0xaaa	The guy is in the Oreburgh city pokemon center.

gdHIAOIPaa	yeah i don't know where to find him either,lol that's a hard quest.
bKEQMaNDaa	There are a handful of ways to raise your reputation with the Kirin Tor. The first way you’ll get reputation with them is through the quests they offer in Borean Tundra and Dragonblight, as well as the Violet Hold quest. Upon reaching friendly status, you can purchase their tabard and wear it in level 80 dungeons and heroic dungeons. Other than that, you can also earn an easy 150 reputation per day doing the cooking daily from the inn in Dalaran. After you’ve earned an exalted reputation with the Kirin Tor, there’s still the matter of the 16,000 gold to come up with, though. <a href="http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-USA-c-51.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-...</a>|`|12zwullSaa	Well, before getting it, I advise you get exalted with the Kirin'Tor, as that will cut off about 3000 gold from the base price, now for making money, use professions, sell stuff, do daily quests in icecrown, Grizzly Hills, Storm Peaks, and wherever else, and also save up the money.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HdF9gD8jaa	Over time it becomes easier. For instance, in one run of naxx10, which i do every week in about 2 hours, everyone int he raid makes roughly 300g. Also, professions is a great way to make money, specifically the gathering ones (mining, herbalism, and skinning). Just farm trade goods and sell them at auction.<br>  <br>  That being said, 20k is in no way easy to come by... Most of the people that have that much have been playing since vanilla. Also buying gold is never a smart thing to do, as it can get your accounts banned and/or deleted. (not to mention 20k gold would cost you hundreds and hundreds of dollars...)
63da1f2c586ef9e69acfa98f679534e2aa	No.  There are setups that are impossible.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	No, because the cards are dealt differently every time.  There is no way for you to win every time because it is programmed not to allow that to happen.|`|IuGSePCeaa	Nope,every game changes. You may win one this time and the next you don't. It just depends on how good you are.

SjGpbohiaa	Yes I tried it on my PC and i only got one game to play and it was slow.|`|IC0ELEmjaa	It would really play terrible if there is, with the touchscreen needing to be used.

wQOoiAwsaa	I've never played any of the previous Oblivions, but all I know is that this game rocks! If your a fan of RPGs and you own a 360, this game is a must buy.  This is an amazing game. So many different things going on and different paths you can take. I hope they make another one for the Xbox 360 like this. this game has a perfect change of pace from the traditional turn-based, random encounter role playing game. The developers obviously put a lot of time and care into this game.|`|IC0ELEmjaa	RuneScape? Oblivion makes RS seem as straightforward as the original Mario Bros.

X2L4LYxqaa	it is only in korea right now and is planned to go live in u.s and europe later this year, they have not set a date yet. it looks like they are trying to perfect it before a worldwide release and will most likely be a 15$ a month  to play. it looks very similar to world of warcraft and im a bit tired of that game so i'll be giving it a try, it was named korea's game of the year in 2008 by some major source.. not sure if that means much.

rREPH4ENaa	Both guys are wrong, there is a skull on floodgate but it dosent unlock recon so somebody told u wrong or lied because then everybody would have recon, only way to get recon is to impress bungie by doing something amazing or you can get the vidmaster achievements which come out with the mythic map pack in a couple weeks but to get the entire recon armor, shoulders, head, chest, you have to buy halo 3: ODST wich comes out in fall and also complete the vidmaster achievements in there to gain the entire set of recon armor. Halo 3 has 4 vidmaster achievements which u can look how to unlock below at the link and Halo 3: ODST has 3 achievements, but are currently unknown, so like i said before u need to have halo 3 and halo 3:ODST which u can buy in stores this fall for 60$, :(|`|SBcxooLsaa	go on google and find it|`|QcMr2cpNaa	I am POSITIVE you were lied to concerning this.<br>  Very few people get recon armor as easy as finding a skull...<br>  However if you wait for the mythic map pack and get all vidmaster achievements, you will receive recon.

From what i hear, chaining and getting to 40 invreases your chance of getting a shiny 1/200. when chaining, the patch of grass shaking will have an odd goldish look. it will look very different from a regular patch. You should keep chaining until you see one like that.

To officially beat<br>  the game, you have to have the pokedex filled, and take it to professor <br>  oak in eterna city, But you have to of already beaten the Elite four and<br>  finished the sinnoh pokedex, which the code does. Another cool thing<br>  is that in the hotel place on route 213, the president(something like that)<br>  of Gamefreak (the company that makes the pokemon games) will give you a certificate thats shows you filled the national pokedex. If you want<br>  to see it more than once, just go back to him and talk to him again.<br>  You can only do this once every time you turn on the game.

Yy33fAvLaa	To solve the Chain Puzzle, turn around and look at the plaques on the wall opposite the chains.  The chains should be in that order.  By pulling each chain, it not only activates movement of that particular chain, but also one other chain.  It is not very difficult, really, but I managed to solve it by: clicking on 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 4, and 1 (from left to right).

SYqOn6Sraa	The Sims 2 is A Great Game ! <br>  To get up the stairs in the sims 2, first you must look at the bottom left corner of your screen. There is a house cut in half. The top half is on a button, and the bottom half is on a button. If your going up stairs click the top half of the house. If your going down, click the bottom half. When You click your desired half click on the floor of where that button has led you, once you have, select run_here/go_here/etc.

4f2GaLhpaa	Maybe he feels cheated, like you stole it from him. Maybe trade him some other ones so he feels better since it is just a game. (:|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Edit:Well you didn't add that in your original question.Yes..if you own both then the creatures are yours.Tell him to stop crying then. <br>  <br>  Hes probably mad at you because you traded Pokemon to your game that were not yours and without asking his permission also.Yeah,it is just a game,and ne need to cry over it....but still you took something of his that he can't get back without asking for his approval.I would be a little angry too.|`|SMCa68oTaa	dude, you are so right, tell him to cry it all out, he will eventually get over it. i have the same problem|`|PQy6if0Waa	Kind of like Christian said... Even though they were your games, was he the one who captured said Pokémon? That's probably why he got upset...<br>  <br>  You took his pokémon without asking, so now he's upset.<br>  <br>  If they were captured by you in the first place, I don't see why he'd be upset.<br>  <br>  If he did capture & train them... you taking advantage of being the 'owner' of the game and just take them away, that's kind of unfair. I'd say you should apologize... <br>  <br>  You probably don't think it's a big deal, but it probably is to him.<br>  Can't hurt to say sorry.. Telling him 'It isn't a big deal' is like shooting the finger all up in his face and saying, "F*** you, I took your stuff. Go cry about it."<br>  That's like your parent's taking all of your possessions and selling them, and they said, "Well, all that stuff was technically ours..."... Wouldn't be so fair, huh?|`|LlMxQhHYaa	i think u should just make it up to him. tell him he can use ur game sometimes when ur not using it so its like u never traded them in the first place. or tell him that u will find a better pokemon that would make up for the lost one. if all else fails punch him in the face. that always works for me. jp|`|hzMNxTFXaa	YOu shouldnt have traded it in the first place, but if he's 13 and your his bigger sibling, why the HECK where you playing on Pokemon. I know my answer was discouraging unlike the rest but i give it to tou straight.

ffub0felaa	Hi,<br>  Did you end up getting a warhammer key?<br>  If not let me know and I will send you one.
x2hW0tqraa	I doubt it. Emerald was almost a remake, because lots of G/S/C things, such as music and tile styles, was hidden deep in the ROM. It wasn't,though. Nintendo has lots of great games they won't remake or put in English (such as Mother 3).|`|8RkYlaQxaa	Ehh, maybe.<br>  <br>  If they do, I wouldn't buy it. Pokemon Gold and Silver for the GBC was priceless. A remake isn't necessary. Besides, I hated Fire Red and Leaf Green, it was basically just Red, Blue, and Green with Ruby, Saphire, and Emerald graphics. It was boring.<br>  <br>  BUT! If you want a Gold and Silver remake, just download the ROM for it. Some guy made it. Its OK.
PFejQPb2aa	the old thick ps2 have a problem with reading disks after a while and the slim version no idea with that lol but ya i was talkin to the gamestop ppl and they said that thick 1s tend to do that (like mine very pissed bout that lol)|`|AA11545963	do you have the old fat ps2 or a slim.  the old fat ones had problems after a while, (at least mine) would only play the black bottomed disks, not the bluish ones.  its probably just gettin old.

CQmITRetaa	I did the same thing, anyways, you have to go to both the sides. Now, from the other side (where u r right now), you have to activate switch (or something) using Kinesis.<br>  <br>  Once you do that, go back to the other side (using that lift) and activate the 2nd switch. After doing that, your task here is done. Get back to that engine room (where the Store is)<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Have Fun...

AGqnjmgpaa	Disney World has some of the best attraction for the money, also universal studies is right around the corner, not to mention ron Jon's surf shop, plus coco beach is only 45 minutes away.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	neither, Universal Studios|`|q7ZMQeCMaa	DISNEY WORLD!!!WOOP WOOP!!!!|`|Ax54M1Dhaa	Disney world is far larger and has way more too offer but I've always liked Disneyland the best because it was the original and has a wonderfully classic feel to it when you go.|`|HD8Cm7PSaa	Disneyland all the way!!! Because it's the original place where the magic began. :D|`|cc90d2a591e25825c1e6d529e9d6de8daa	disney world|`|N2Xto1pFaa	Definitely World. I've honestly never been to Disneyland, but I'm a Floridian, so I've been to Walt Disney World more times than I can count, but Disneyland only really has their version of the Magic Kingdom and California Adventure. WDW has Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM Studios (actually they just renamed it Disney's Hollywood Studios), and Animal Kingdom as main parks, as well as 2 Water Parks, Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. Also there's Downtown Disney, although they're taking down the Pleasure Island part of that because Disney doesn't want to associate with "adult" stuff. Family friendly only....<br>  <br>  But I just think WDW has so much more to offer. The only problem is how rad expensive it is. For just a day it's $60 or so without "Park Hopper", which allows you to switch between the 4 main parks.|`|xPLpCKsyaa	Disney World!!! It's sooo much fun you will enjoy it!!!

I'm not sure if that is creative, but they make you think, and people that aren't even that good at video games can play it, you just have to think hard to figure out the puzzles. They are very fun and a new one just came out called Tomb Raider Underworld, which is really fun. Its for Xbox 360, PS3, PC...and a few other consoles. If you only have a Play Station 2, then go with Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Anniversary. I hope I helped you out!|`|YFmtHNkiaa	Baulder's Gate, Baulder's Gate 2, Neverwintter Nights, and Neverwinter Nights 2 are all really fun RPG games. based off of D&D game rules but it's virtual fighting and stuff. they are all a part of a series of RPGs set in the same world and Baulder's Gate is the first one. amazing game i love them all and they aren't very popular but they are a lot of fun (especially the blood and gore parts :D lol)|`|aXO2IiOmaa	For PC, look up Darkfall Online. It's an online skilled based fps/third person MMO where you build fortresses and cities and take them over in clan wars. Servers support up to 10,000 people and it's released on the 25th. There aren't any levels like in WoW or classes it's all skill based.<br>  <br>  www.darkfallonline.com<br>  <br>  Also, check out Savage 2. It's a free game.

I know it's not the most original gma eout there, but it's good.

ArIKfDK9aa	Guild Wars.<br>  <br>  Guild Wars provides two main modes of gameplay—a cooperative role-playing component and a competitive player vs. player (PvP) component—both of which are hosted on ArenaNet's servers. The games depict the history of the fictional fantasy world of Tyria, each campaign focusing on events in disjoint sections of the world, but roughly parallel in time. A player creates an avatar to play through the cooperative storyline of a campaign, taking on the role of a hero who must save Tyria from episode-specific antagonists. Players can group with other players and non-player characters, known as henchmen or heroes, to perform missions and quests found throughout the game-world. PvP combat is consensual, team based, and limited to areas designed for such combat. Players are allowed to create characters at maximum level and the best equipment specifically for PvP play, which is unusual for MMORPGs. ArenaNet hosts official Guild Wars tournaments where the most successful players and guilds may compete for the chance to play live at gaming conventions and win prizes up to 100,000 USD.

AvnG6t4baa	I think, not sure that they should work in CPQ. During natural 2x exp events, they work in CPQ, so with 2x card, it should work. If you are statless, i suggest doing rm 5/6, and training on the rombots with the 2x. The rombots should give 500+ exp. You can make a party of 3, find some noob party, and after you enter, you can kick the other two members, and get all the exp to yourself. You probably won't win, but the 500 exp/ rombot is pretty good.|`|9prBDg9Zaa	They work for the monsters there, but they don't work when you receive the prize exp. =)

YOU GOTTA TO LOVE HEIGHTS!!!!!!WOOP WOOP!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	Depends which one your talking about? if it is the one at dreamworld it is fun, my friends said it is scary the first time, but then they loved it and went on it ten times. i wish it was working when i was there,you cant see the ground anyway so why would it be really scary anyway?<br>  it was the tallest and fastest in the world when it opened in 1997, it would be scary when it falls backwards real fast..<br>  <br>  the american one then i don't know, i'm australian not american :(<br>  <br>  have fun go on it anyway, you wont regret it.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	its soooo much fun!<br>  <br>  its only "scary" cuz it has a creepy atmosphere. its quite dark. <br>  you learn about a group of 5 people that got in an elevator in 1939 and disappeared to "the twilight zone" <br>  then you get on an elevator (don't worry you sit in a seat and put a seat belt on. you aren't just standing in an elevator or anything) and you go up a few floors and watch the people disappear then go up a few more floors and the elevator leaves the shaft and travels down a hallway and then into another elevator shaft. then it is pitch black and you suddenly drop. then you go up and down an unknown number of times (the computer makes it different every time) and you fall from different heights. at least once you go up to the top 13 stories up and look out a window and as you fall your pic is taken. <br>  <br>  if you like the feeling of weightlessness and and that tickley feeling in your stomach then you will love the ride. <br>  <br>  here is a video of the ride if that won't ruin it for you. <br>  pre show:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAgIkaCNUk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAgIkaCN...</a><br>  <br>  actual ride:(keep in mind this person had a light on their camera so it seems fairly bright but when you are on the ride is it much darker)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZc_0Yx8_YA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZc_0Yx8_...</a><br>  <br>  AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TO BE AT LEAST 13 TO ENJOY IT. <br>  MY NEICE WAS 5 WHEN SHE FIRST WENT ON. AND SHE LOVED IT. <br>  I FIRST WENT ON WHEN I WAS 8 BUT THATS CUZ TOWER OF TERROR OPENED IN 1994 AND I WAS 8  THAT YEAR.|`|ixQC3WNRaa	its soo much fun. but it depends. if you like the feeling you get when you accelerate really fast, like a drop on a roller coaster, when it feels like your stomach is gone, then it's great. if you don't like that feeling, then don't go on it. you have that feeling pretty much the whole ride.|`|JEUshzOVaa	only if u want to CRAP URSELF!!!!!!! lol =P|`|N2Xto1pFaa	It's really not that scary. But it depends on your age and how easily scared you are. It's just a restrained fall, so you get that airy feeling in your chest but I think it's loads of fun. You can make yourself feel better by saying things like "Second floor, Lingerie" when the elevator goes up a story in the very beginning before it drops. My friends and I do that all the time.|`|13a3e85e4c05a2e14ff14ad31a6982f9aa	YES<br>  i am like obsessed with that ride<br>  lol<br>  the one in disney world is like 10x better than the one in disney land, though. cause it doesnt just go up, it goes forward too and its crazy<br>  <br>  but the thing about tower of terror is the drop isnt scary at ALL<br>  cause you cant see where your about to fall, so its not like a drop zone.<br>  the thing thats scary about tower of terror is the build up<br>  the set up is AMAZING<br>  its so realistic its unbelievable<br>  but thats what makes the ride so incredibly great<br>  it is my favorite ride of all time|`|rJ79B2xAaa	Ok. It's not to bad. But I suggest you have some friends with you because some people get really sick and faint. I REALLY SUGGEST THAT YOUR AT LEAST ABOVE 13 because some below that can't take it. If your bodie's ready then yea.<br>  It's scary if your below. It's fun when your're above 13 because it tickles your stomach like the one when your in the car and you're in a really high hill.|`|eCtrOR3Baa	It depends, are you ok with heights and sudden drops? I love the feeling in my stomach when I suddenly drop so I absolutely loved it. I was scared to go on it too but it was totally worth it. If you don't like drops and heights then it is not the ride for you.|`|l7tijAohaa	The theme makes it more scary than what it really is. Its more fun that scary. For an extra thrill, during the ride, don't let your feet touch the ground!|`|LAhGRwU9aa	just go you like it|`|TA8P2s29aa	i think is fun if u want to download new pc games here <a href="http://kamalepatel.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://kamalepatel.blogspot.com</a>|`|Ga3gN4hmaa	Yeah it's fun. It's not that bad you just go up and down. You get a little queasy in your stomach but that's all from what i remember.|`|SsypSLHWaa	it is i was really afraid of heights but braved it anyway . i was11 and am much less afraid now

5zxxQqeOaa	It all depends on what you like to do, and what the economy is like on your server. Look in the auction house and see what prices are for Copper/Tin. If there are a lot of high levels on your server, you might get 10 to 12 gold a stack for Copper just because people are rich and lazy. Copper is easy to find around Westfall by the way. If you like to run instances, Enchanting could help in the long run. If you get a lot of uncommon items and disenchant them, you could make money off the auction house by selling the mats. Plus at a higher level, you will probably want enchants, and you will already have enchanting and mats. Skinning is a fairly easy profession to level. You can pretty much skin any mob which makes leveling/money making pretty easy. If you like question though, you could simply do that. If you do every quest in the place you are questing in, soon you will make a lot of money. Also, don't buy any gear off the auction house, for you will replace it in about 4 levels anyway. This can also save you money. Hope this helps in your WoW experience :). Have fun and good luck|`|oT40tvq6aa	Mining will make you a lot of money if you sell the bars and put them up on the AH, enchanting on the other hand you will probably lose money because it cost a lot to level it up.|`|2PGIoNUHaa	Sure keep them.<br>  <br>  Enchanting costs lots of money though...but in the end, for me at least, its a big turnout. Being able to Disenchant in raids/dungeons...<br>  <br>  Mining - Good for money. Period. Just farm and farm while you quest and level, and sell the ore/bars/stones in the AH for good money.<br>  <br>  Enchanting - Okay for money...costs about an average of at least 1,000 gold on most servers, due to mats. You disenchant the mats of your quest items when you reach Northrend, and sell in the AH.

i09pUyE4aa	dude i'm totally addicted to FFX and FFX-2.<br>  they should for serious make a third one...<br>  i'd play it.<br>  <br>  i like to complete games though, so i replay them to get 100 percent, and maximize all my dressphere abilities and stuff.<br>  i still can't beat shinra at sphere break though, so i can't get that one. :||`|L97FuHl9aa	ff x was by far the best ff game and i know i know ff 7 was great but in ff x you can play as the summons and you gt to play blitzball the best game ever i love it i beat it like  5 times and thats alot for that game lol|`|jK7pklCKaa	FFX was a great game and easily one of the best final fantasy games. however personally i hated FFX-2, it was a pointless game and was far too "girl power" for my taste <br>  <br>  I believe it was both the characters and the engaging story which made the game addicting and it is also quite challenging.<br>  <br>  I generally wish they would stop releasing sequels/prequels/spin offs to final fantasy games, usually the original is brilliant but then they release one or 2 of the above and it spoils the original. FF8 and FF9 and my all time favorite final fantasy games and square made the right decision by not releasing anything extra for that number in the series.

43zXRpLYaa	The ticket booths at Disneyland Resort were temporarily shut down this morning but have reopened after authorities determined that a suspicious white powder found on the park's ticket booths was harmless, authorities said.<br>  <br>  Cleaning crews reported early this morning that they had spotted an unusual white substance at the windows of several ticket booths. Police were called in at 7:30 a.m.<br>  <br>  Some guests entered Disneyland when the park opened at 8 a.m. (California Adventure was not yet open), Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown said. But when the powder was found on more ticket booths, park officials decided to temporarily hold back all guests from the ticketing area until police could investigate the powder. The booths were shuttered at 8:45 a.m.<br>  <br>  Disneyland was never closed, as some guests were allowed in. The ticket areas were closed down for a while, though, keeping other guests out.<br>  <br>  "We thought it would be best to close off all ticket booths until we could make sure there was nothing hazardous," Brown said.<br>  <br>  Anaheim police called in a hazardous-materials unit from the Anaheim Fire Department. Samples were tested and soon determined to be nothing more than a fine, nonhazardous sand, said police Sgt. Rick Martinez.<br>  <br>  Guests and employees who were held back for more than an hour were allowed to enter the ticket area at 9:45 a.m. Martinez said. California Adventure opened at 10 a.m.<br>  <br>  "The safety of our guests and our cast members is our top priority," Brown said. "The measures that were taken today were done so in an abundance of caution."<br>  <br>  Investigators were working with park officials to review surveillance video, looking for who might have deposited the substance on the ticket booths. No arrests had been made.<br>  <br>  "We're not sure if it was a prank or a deliberate attempt to disrupt park operations," Martinez said. "Either way, this is serious business. And we will be following up."|`|AV0eejfLaa	they found some kind of powder substance <a href="http://cbs13.com/local/disneyland.suspicious.powder.2.941168.html" rel="nofollow">http://cbs13.com/local/disneyland.suspic...</a>|`|Wq3tkVHSaa	Just read this in the news.

MLSLuRBJaa	You can access this game during the intermission.  When the menu screen comes up shows the stats from the game (shots on goal, score, how many goals were scored in each period).  Underneath it should say something along the lines of "to play Zamboni Game" and show a button to push.  For the Wii it shows you to push the minus button.  I am not sure about other systems but during the intermission screen it will tell you what button to push.

After the actual ability, spell, or effect that puts a -1/-1 counter resolves and the stack is empty, state-based effects are checked and the creature is then sent to the graveyard.|`|9KeaTUh6aa	If at any time a creature is in play and has a toughness of 0 (meaning it has no +X/+1 counters and there are no effects like Glorious Anthem in play), it is sent to the graveyard. In short, yep!|`|u4CrCt23aa	yes it does|`|M4gvNbf6aa	When the counter is placed on the creature, it becomes a 0/0.
