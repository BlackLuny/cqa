Its a free program that works really well.. Just go to avast.com to get it.

There are emulators for the TI-81, 92, 99, and 85 where they can be found here: http://www.zophar.net/macintosh/ti.html    Or, you could always try running a Windows emulator under Wine.

dkpIjt5jaa	I would check your Dell model's support web site for information about installing Windows on an external source.      Just to be sure as it must be in the BIOS as a boot option !

Fp0jrUtOaa	I believe you were asking what kind of scam these folks were running.  My guess is that it's a variation of the check fraud scam.  Several scenarios come to mind.    1) They are buying your products using stolen credit card numbers.  If/when the theft of the card is discovered and the real owner disputes the charges, the bank will come back to you for reimbursement of the money paid.  Meanwhile, you're still out the merchandise (plus whatever shipping is to Australia).    2) They are using their own credit cards but plan to dispute the charges themselves, again sticking you with the bill while they get the merchandise.  (This is a lot less likely than the first scenario because there are only so many times they can run the con before their own bank shuts the account down for suspicious activity, but it still happens occasionally.)    3) They will overpay for the merchandise, then ask you to refund them the difference.  They may have some plausible excuse for overpaying but their real intent is to cancel the payment as soon as they have your repayment in hand.  They exploit the lag time needed to clear checks, especially international checks.    Whichever flavor of scam they're running, you want to avoid them.  Legitimate customers should come through legitimate channels.  Unsolicited and ambiguous requests like this deserve your suspicion.  Keep up the good work.|`|3sCrTA1Raa	its  a scam.  if i were  you i'd take  the name and  search it on MySpace  just for the heck of it.|`|VGmBXLq9aa	There is no reason to respond to this mail or to believe that this is a scam, delete it immediately no matter if it was malicious or not.|`|mWhIAXqXaa	do not respond back. probably a scam. possible the guy got the wrong email account. but most importantly, DONT RESPOND BACK

Or you can get a switch, If you just have 2 computers that would be less cost efficient. A switch costs around $30.00 and you would need 2 ethernet cables, about 5 dollars each.

xe1NoWUNaa	Two of the best registry cleaners out there are Ccleaner and Glarysoft.com. Glary Utility's     Sorry' But there is no such thing as a good free anti virus. Some people on here will try to lead you to believe that free AV's will keep your computer safe. They will not. You can't get something for nothing. If you want one that really works do some research. You can do it right here on answers and you will find posting after posting where AVG' AVAST didn't stop a virus/spy ware/ Trojan infection. At the most what they will do is detect it but it will not remove it. The job of a good anti virus is not to detect it once it's on your machine. It's job is to stop it from getting in and on your hard drive. Once it's on your machine it's to late. If you want a good one that really works as advertised your gonna have to pay for it. Right now the only one out there that is doing as advertised is Kaspersky products like Kaspersky itself or Defender Pro powered by Kaspersky. I am telling you this from experience. Free AV's like AVG and AVAST are a joke. Don't rely on them. They have no proactive defense. That in itself should be a huge turnoff when it comes to choosing a AV. Who in there right mind would want a AV that can be disabled by a hacker/ viruse/Trojan' You name it. If it can be disabled it's worthless. If it can't stop a infection before it gets into you machine and on your hard drive it's worthless.|`|w6xxEZMYaa	Antivirus   ESET Smart Security go download a trial and get the full verson from nod321.com u get free username and pass so u can upgrade  it every 5 months not wait 30 days and then bye eset.

(just make sure you backup your registry before making any changes)    As for Antivirus the most popular and the highest rated are not the same, I have cleaned up many virus ridden pc's with AVG supposedly protecting them.

dkpIjt5jaa	First find and note your exact model number ( this is important as there are 161 variations of this model ).    You will find the sticker with that information on the underside of the laptop.    Once you have located and noted it, head over to: http://h20180.www2.hp.com/apps/Lookup?h_...    Find your exact number in the list and click on it.    You will now be at the entrance to the portal for your machine, explore everything you can find on it (there is plenty !)      I'm pretty sure your problem is with the amount of RAM installed, there is just not enough for delegating 64 MB more to the Video chip.    You can go here to learn more about the memory needed in your PC: http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configur...    Once again, search for your exact model.      Hope this helps
Hy1Sd2C2aa	Pop-ups is a very general term. If you are referring to programs starting up and then popping up like AIM or weather bug then that is an easy fix. I am assuming you want to still keep those programs so what you will need to do is hold down the windows key on your keyboard then hit the letter "r". Type into the little dialogue box  that appears "msconfig". This will bring up a windows with several tabs up above it. Select the one labeled "start up". There you will see many program names with little boxes checked besides them and other information about the program. Simply scroll down the list until you see the program you do not want to pop up or start up with your computer and un-check the box. You will need to hit the apply button after all boxes have been unchecked. After doing so you will be prompted to restart. When you restart, the program should not pop up anymore and a dialogue box will pop up asking you to keep the new settings or not. Make sure though that you do select the correct program when un-checking boxes. If you do make a mistake though simply choosing to revert to last settings in the aforementioned dialogue box will fix the mistake. If it doesn't you can always go back through these steps and reselect the box you un-checked.|`|w6xxEZMYaa	it depents what u mean if its like programs u go to run msconfig and fix it there if not u got infected by a virus.|`|EQbcu6SXaa	well it's easy..all you have to do is go to RUN --> then type MSCONFIG -->then go to start up and uncheck the unwanted programs..then restart the pc

iT10eqLqaa	I am certainly not an expert, but .....    A copyrighted DVD contains video files that are encrypted, and DVD players and commercial programs like PowerDVD have the ability to decrypt them as they play back the disc.    The process of copying a DVD involves first reading the video stream, and then burning them to a new disc.      For home-made video discs this is no problem, and they can be duplicated by Nero without any decryption software required.    In the case of a copyrighted disc, Nero recognizes that the disc is encrypted and prevents duplication.  If you used some type of decryption software (DVD Decrypter was an example of this type of software, but I believe that it is no longer available), then you would have unencrypted video files just like your home-made DVD.      The burning software (Nero etc.) simply writes the DVD files to the new disc.  If you had to decrypt the original files to read them, the copy would NOT be copy-protected.    As a side-note, I believe that some disc protection mechanisms contain a flag that indicates if copies can be made, and if so how many generations.  This allows for the creation of a DVD 'master' to creating many copies that are themselves copy-protected.    I think that *technically* Nero could duplicate a commercial disc, and the duplicate would also be copy protected, but that would be illegal in most jusidictions, and they do not want you to do it.    One other note is that commercial disc protection does not only rely on encryption.  Other techniques include creating invalid disc structures (that a DVD player would never read) which would cause a decryption program that scans the entire disc to fail.    ;)|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	NO, the new DVD will not have protection.

OR  Contact your computer manufacturer for a restore disk.  This will cost you a few bucks, but should be cheaper than buying a full version of widows.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:    1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.  5. Click OK.    3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:    1. Open your Start menu.  2. Click Run  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.  6. Click "OK"

yqqVPcU0aa	It won't do anything if you are using the standard Windows, "Defrag", option.      There are many other programs that have built-in defragers, that allow scheduled operations with options.  On mine, if my computer is in sleep mode, it will wake up the computer to run defrag if I set that option.  If the computer is off, then it'll just run automatically the next time the computer is up and running.      Get another defrag program with schedule options.  I use the one included with my virus scanner, McAfee.  Tune-UP utilities also has a built-in defrag with options.|`|f9gcRmhGaa	You're kidding, right?    The computer has to be turned on, and not in standby or sleep mode for the scheduler or the defragging program to work.    You might be able to have the program shutdown the PC once its done... it depends on the program used.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Unless it is running it can not do anything.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Forget scheduling..get an automatic defragmenter called  Diskeeper 2009 ( http://www.diskeeper.com ). I use it, and I never have to defrag manually or schedule for late nights. Diskeeper will defrag in the background while you are using your computer normally and without affecting your running applications...no need to leave the system on at night  just for a defrag.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and   "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.    You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java",   "Flash" or various web browsers -- and definitely stay away  from software that salespeople (disguised as answerers on  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.    None of those things will help you, because your computer   and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right?   The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add,   change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.    I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a   lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why   in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good   for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).    Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of  their own servers every single day without warning anybody,   in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions,   it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or   "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.    If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing   you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages,   it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet   files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay   there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer   much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of   them. The solution to that is to clear your "cache" of all the   "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and "history". Then reboot.    If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without   having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send  send me a note, ideally with your YouTube or regular email   address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache"   (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts   my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.   (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "answers"   have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer   is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch   or access videos, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|k4dQsHKkaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..    you can try a different browser...    these will help you...    1. Use Opera browser, it will load faster and smoother,  and re-install latest flash (the correct way)    get the latest flash player, and install it.. make sure all the browsers are NOT running during installation... this is the right way to install the flash player.    by the way, the javascript is turned on by default.    OR..    2. It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.    Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .    It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.    ==========================???|`|qxxXxKlXaa	try restarting your computer|`|n7UCMIFLaa	Don't download flash player from a video site, download directly from adobe:  http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplaye...

FQ39Q4ZQaa	Well, i use vegas to make my videos. If you want to try it you can get it here:  www.download.com  you can get songs here (using YouTube):  www.vixy.com    and you can get video clips (Such as from tv shows, movies, or anime as long as you can find the episodes/movies/clips some where on the internet [like on youtube]) useing hypercam (you can also get at download.com).     As for uploading videos on Youtube:    1.) they can only be so long or it will take FOREVER to upload.  2.) the file cant be to larg  3.) I would use AVI or Windows Media Audio/Video file      I will say that none of these downloads contane harmful to your PC/Mac. 100% CLEAN|`|k4dQsHKkaa	Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|zBRaqw21aa	Haha I watched your videos they were good.    Anyway, different scenes is really easy. All you have to do is film different scenes. Simple.    Adding audio is also easy.

If your videos are to long, YouTube wont accept them. With windows, you can add music, cut scenes, add titles, add credits, and make the scenes look cool with different effects. 10 points please?|`|rAmR0g9Taa	Try Windows Movie Maker or One True Media, their easy to manage free program has cool features that include drag and drop capability, upload images, add text, music, effects, background and transitions.     If your looking for something more advanced but still user friendly then try Animoto, Roxio Creator 2009 or Wondershare Photo Story Platinum they have everything you need in making your own slide show (video): some of the features included enable you to add your own images, videos, mp3 music, effects, transitions and more making your video unique to you. Everything is laid out in an easy to follow step by step instruction.    Some of the programs allow you to export easily to youtube with just one click of the button.     Check out the video (slide show) I made with Animoto and One True Media.    I hope that I was of some help and answered your question.

E70A7aqcaa	As I read "quatre70 . . ." 's answer, I was confused because I didn't hear you say you had a wireless router.  Or maybe wireless incryption doesn't mean you have a wireless router, BUT, the only reason I came to answer your question is that it sounds like the EXACT problem I had with my Linksys router with my PC, and I went round and round with the help people about it, who were absolutely NO help whatsoever.  They did have me return to the store time and time again, purchasing yet a different router of theirs till I hollered "HALT" to it all and took my computer and router to yet another computer repair store, and it just so happened that the owner there knew something about the codes of my service provider since he had worked with them in the past, and he typed in some codes and it all worked well again.  I know this may be of  no specific help to you except to say DON'T rely on Linksys help for anything, especially if you're not Pakistani or Indian or whatever from over there, and even then, if you  understand their very broken English, they DON'T have the answer.  "quatre70 . . ." 's answer begins as I had done my router and modem numerous times, so, it sounded good to that point, but, after that I got lost, which isn't anything new for me, but just realize that Linksys help DOESN'T help, except to have you run to the store  numerous times getting you to buy numerous of their routers, to no avail in helping you with your problem.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  God Bless you.|`|D88aMYx3aa	Take a pen, press the reset button on the back of the router, hold it in for 15 seconds (while plugged into power). At about the 10 second mark the router lights should all blink, and the router will reset to factory defaults.    Than plug your desktop into the router like normal, type http://192.168.1.1 in your web address bar, and login to the router with a blank username (no username) and "admin" as the password than follow the instructions the router came with to setup your wireless encryption (VERY IMPORTANT)    http://vectrosecurity.com/content/view/4...

elgVgRCRaa	Your computer's motherboard probably only supports 3GB RAM. Windows 32bit only handles 4GB total memory space anyways. This includes the VRAM (video card memory) and other components. You would end up with about 3.3GB RAM recognized by Vista. Stick with 3GB RAM or send the 2GB kit back for 1GB. Either way you won't utilize all 4GB with Vista 32bit. The memory should be the exact same for dual channel. You must have 4 slots so therefore by having 2 different timing sets in different dual channel controllers you are fine. The memory controller will also slow down fast sticks if need be. Just stick with 3GB|`|jwurmVbVaa	the RAM have to be exactly the same to work together.

There are some laws protecting email to some extent. Medical files or other sensitive information is best send by delivery service or hand delivered personally.

While the file is downloading, you can click to highlight the one you are interested in. Now that it is highlighted, right click and it will allow you to open the destination folder where this file is. Then you can go in there and copy, move,  or delete whatever you want.    However, utorrent is actually a good way to keep track of all your downloaded files, where ever they are. In the lower pane, it will have all the infor on the file, it will say general, tracker, peers, etc and if you click on file you have direct access to it, click on it again to play it.    If you wish to just stop downloading it or whatever, go to the above pane and click to hightlight, the right click to either remove it from utorrent without deleting it, (it just will not appear in utorrent anymore but will still be in it's destination folder) or you can delete the entire thing completely

Adding a gig or two of the correct RAM will make your system run faster by a large amount.    Movie editing wise, that's a whole system operation. It taxes your CPU, RAM, and graphics card so if any one of those are lacking, you will likely have lag.|`|AA11570752	ram it up its the cheaper way to speed up your computer|`|i9PhENN6aa	Increasing your RAM is the easiest way to get a performance increase. Navigate to the following to see which memory & how much your computer can handle.    Link: http://www.crucial.com|`|kLHaJ8XKaa	If you can afford to upgrade more than your RAM, do so - I edit video clips but on low quality clips so I can only image how much lag you are getting - however increasing your RAM is the next best thing.    Someone mentioned http://www.crucial.com/ ... they are very good, also www.novatech.co.uk are very reliable, and they're prices (to my knowledge) have been beyond compare.    If you can get your hands on Kingston RAM for a reasonable price, grab it because all kingston RAM has a free lifetime warrenty on it and they quality is exceptionable.    Good luck with your system|`|HSGHgOyYaa	yes   ram is the cheap easy and safe way to go to speed up your computer  i would also think about getting a newer better video card for the hd video problem and video editing. video cards also do good with the games and speeds up your computer period.    i would put up to 1024mb/1gb of ram in there    and replace the old ram because ram can ware down and slow down your computer    trust me i build computers all the time!    and also ram and memory are the same thing|`|sAqfeSapaa	The way I see it, adding RAM may not solve your problem.  There will be an improvement, but the speed increase will not be that evident.  You would also have to consider your CPU speed.    You are currently running with the 'minimum' requirements of magix movie edit pro.  And the recommended specs require the following.  CPU upgrade (2 to 3GHz CPU)  RAM upgrade (1GB ram)    The way I see it, a USD 400 computer these days can already meet your specifications.  I do not suggesting RAM upgrade because your unit is most probably using SD-RAMs and this can not be used with current computers as they have shifted to DDR-RAMs.      Hence, you will be forced to spend more shall you decide on buying a new computer because the RAM can not be used with a new computer.      Assuming you still want to try the RAM upgrade, then to answer your question without the analysis above:  I recommend the brand Corsair or Kingston.    The price difference is not that much compared to generic brands, and this ensures maximum compatibility to different computer brands.|`|SS2pBFZGaa	hi 2 u, the inter net have increased exponetially, so the requirements of ur computer should be greater to compensate, ram & memory r the same thing,ram of 2 gig is preferable,,this will speed up the over speed of the machine, this is an easy upgrade worth doing and can b done in ur home for around 50.oo .....this is my understanding & was not researched...by 4 now..tvtony51...
MvVd0ayCaa	It definately sounds like the computer (or specifically the processor) is overheating. Usually this occurs when the thermal paste (a substance for transfering heat) that is between the fan and the processor gets old and inneffective.     The best method for fixing this is to buy a tube of thermal paste from your local computer store (usually about $10 - $15) and reapplying it.     To do this, you need to take the cover off the bottom where the processor is located, remove the screws on the fan, carefully scrape off the old dry and cracked paste and apply the new stuff then reattach the fan.    If you feel uncomfortable doing this, you could probably take it to any computer store and have them do it (likely for a fee).|`|581661bc9637001924cbebd11b6b75eeaa	One possibility is the battery. If you are running it on the powercord only, remove the battery pack and wee if that solves the problem. As for running slow, well its about five years old and probably has a much slower processor than the ones made today and has significantly less RAM. If the computer has been updated to Vista or even XP the system is too small to handle the larger platform. Contact the computer manufacturer or visit their website and see if you can get a copy of the original programming which was most likely Windows 98 - reformat and then load 98 back it. It wont have all of the current bells and whistles but will probably run much better.|`|sAqfeSapaa	You are correct, there is a high probability that you are experiencing overheating problems.  Normally I will say that you take it to HP for servicing.    But if you are bold enough, you can try opening the base of your laptop and check if you can access the CPU and fan.  If yes, check if the the cpu is connected to the fan (the copper heat sink connecting the fan and cpu), it may have a loose connection.      You can also try turning the fan to check if it has accumulated dust from the years of use.  You can try cleaning the fan, and if it does not work you should replace the fan and your problem will be fixed.|`|tzWw8VO9aa	heat: get a cooling pad    speed: first off make sure it has XP and not vista  get rid of programs you don't use  virus scan and add ware  scan  get more ram

AA10570173	Go into the Help menu, type in Scratch disks. What it means is you don't have enough memory allocated to Photoshop. Photoshop Help will tell you how to do that. If you have been saving a lot of photos and other things that you are editing with Photoshop onto your hard drive, you may need to remove them; you may be running out of hard drive space. Photoshop uses both RAM and the hard drive when processing files. Consider investing in an external hard drive (you can get a 1 Terabyte hard drive for less than $150 now!) and storing all files there, and trying to keep your internal hard drive for applications and such and working files only.|`|3DXXk2ukaa	http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewCont...

So I think you are having a hard time because trojan's are not exactly viruses. So most anti-virus programs will not remove them, because they do not see them as viruses.    A couple of month's back I suffered a nasty trojan infection.  It completely screwed my computer up.  Every time I would get on the internet I would get blasted with pop-up after pop-up.    It got so bad, I thought I would have to get a new computer.  So out of frustration I called Geek Squad.  They wanted $200 to Look at my computer, and that didn't include fixing it.  No Way!    It wasn't until I was searching google for a trojan remover that I came across the solution to my problem.    I found a website that gave honest reviews of the best spyware removal programs.  So I checked into it, and the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.    I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer.    It found all the trojan worms, and spyware infections that none of my other programs could find and delete.     I have been running AdwareAlert now for the last couple of months, and it has been doing an awesome job at keeping my computer spyware free.

n60Vf4Ouaa	yes it does
LGYaBFE4aa	Ok. please listen closely. What your doing is VERY important. This is more than just learning a class, this is the foundation to your career, when i say career i mean your life. money, how much you struggle or how nicely you survive.     When it comes to programming, you take steps. you learn an easy language that prepares you for the next language. believe it or not there all pretty similar. if your struggling now then i recommend backtracking a little bit and finding where you fell off in your previous languages. once you fill those gaps then your going to be prepared to step into the next language. sounds to me as your going into all this really fast and your parents are on your shoulders all the time with it. you have to take a minute to breathe. when i get large programming jobs i get really flustered and overwhelmed in the code that i lose track to whats around me. then i begin forgetting what i'm doing and everything spirals downhill. then i realize i NEED TIME AWAY. so i take a good break, go outside and cut the grass or go somewhere and dont look at a single snippet or anything for a day or 2 then as your sitting there, it will come to you. you will be using the restroom or something and then it hits you, the missing variable or the key to completing your current project. and you rush back to the code and your writing code like you are a pro.   Please Trust me as i say Stick It Out, great things will come from all your hard work.i wish you the best of luck and hope everything falls together for you.|`|1EL52GUuaa	You shouldn't quit.

Look for a file named either inetd.conf or xinetd.conf.  If you can not find either of these files use grep -i inetd * to find it.  4.  Either in the file itself or in a file it imports you will find an entry for ftp.  5.  Change the line that says disable = no to disable = yes.  6.  Save the file and bounce inetd, i do not recall if it automagically picks it up or not.    If this fails to shut it down, it maybe running as a daemon.  In that case try using a program called chkconfig.

W4BbvZq1aa	Hi, me. Anyhoo, how to get around Net Op School. Try this-     1. When your teacher is not looking, unplug the ethernet cable from the back of the computer before you boot it up. Once booted up, plug that sucker back in.    Ethernet cable looks like a giant telephone cord. Usually blue or yellow.     2. Or, if the computer is already on, you might have to log off and unplug it. Or unplug it before you access the Internet. I hope this works for you.     3. H4x0rs only! Kidding. But you can look at the registry for netop, under Danware in system software. And you can look at the teacher's and student's folders in the program files.  Idk what you can do with this (a friend gave me the program to opt out on my flash drive) but have fun.    If your computer still blocks addictinggames.com after this, use UltraSurf. Developed by Chinese hackers to get around the Great fireWall, Ultrasurf is the best. Kidding again. It doesn't work for my home filter, (no youtube for me : ( but it works quite well if you get the "Blocked by Bluecoat" message. Download it at home on a flash drive (don't tell me you don't have one, they are only five to ten bucks) and run it at school. You should be okay then.    5. If it still does not work, make friends with the "hacker kid" in the class (you know who he or she is) and get them to help you.    I know that I'm not supposed to answer my own question, but I really want to help my fellow high school students out. Have fun, kids!

ZvkUBNOtaa	It's locking up because you have incompatible drivers installed on the hard drive.  Drivers are the software programming that runs the hardware on a computer.  Your old Motherboard and the new one may have different chipsets, sound chips, Ethernet controllers, etc and all the drivers from the old board are still on the hard drive and trying to load at startup.  The reason it will run in safe mode is that it only loads a minimal set of generic drivers to get to safe mode.    You need to uninstall the old drivers and install the new ones that came with the board.  They'll be on a CD or DVD that was in the package with the board but usually those are pretty well out of date and it's best to download new ones from the manufacturer's website.    I would try installing the drivers from the CD/DVD that came with the board first, just to get the system working.  Then update from the internet.  You should be able to run the driver installation programs in safe mode.    You can probably leave the old drivers on the hard drive, the hardware calls won't access a driver that isn't written for the hardware, usually.  If you have trouble after you install the new drivers then uninstall the old ones.    It's also possible but not likely (from your description) that the board needs a BIOS update, but if you're not familiar with that kind of thing avoid doing it, it can hatch the board's BIOS chip and render your computer useless.    Good luck :)|`|LN6AskZhaa	reinstall windows

But if someone visits your profile via a link on someone elses profile you get the link of the second one ofcourse.    You only get information of the IP address of the real visitor (country info)    More visitor trackers on http://webdesign.coolstart.nl/    If you really want to control who views your page you must build in more security like an extra logincode people must apply for (if this works on myspace the same as on websites, many it does)    Will keep it in my mind, interesting.
vBWw77Ydaa	Yes, probably.    But without a link to your profile, no one is going to be able to tell you what the code is.    Do you have any style commands with overflow in them?  Maybe  overflow:hidden    Look for that.    I have some information here, on making scroll boxes work, with music player skins that use overflow:hidden.  The same concepts should work, to override other style commands that cause scroll box issues:  http://views-under-construction.blogspot...
Z1qoQjsZaa	It could be that the dvd you are trying to play is not compatible. Try a different dvd.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	It could be a driver issue, go to the computer manufacturer's support web site to download the latest version for your Operating System.    While you are there, download ALL the latest drivers for your laptop to make it more performing.        Try this trick ( Source = http://www.microsoft.com/ ) :      Why doesn't the computer recognize my CD/DVD+/-R or CD/DVD+/-RW drive?      Answer: The drive may no longer be installed correctly.    To verify that your CD/DVD drive is recognized, do the following:    1) Open My Computer.    2) In the Devices with Removable Storage area, right-click the drive, and then click Properties. If your CD drive is recognized, you will see it there.    3) If not, right-click and select troubleshooting (or just select it if already shown).      Hope this helps|`|8AfLWiYeaa	it could be just that it won't play on that certain desktop.|`|fi7Aq9cWaa	There's a couple things that could happen here. Firstly, when was the last time you restarted your computer? That could be a problem, that your system was updated via online, and you need to restart your system for everything to work properly.    Second, how old is the laptop? You may have burned out your codec, or may be in need of a completely new DVD drive. That's what happened to my first laptop.|`|fY5obK1Yaa	Well, it could be a variety of issues, but it most likely is not a virus causing this.  Your Laptop DVD drive could be malfunctioning, or the data cable to the drive could have become loose. It is more likely it is broken than loose.  If your laptop is still under the manufacturers warranty you can probably get it replaced, if not buy a new drive off of the manufacturers site, or find a comparable drive at http://www.newegg.com. If your drive will play other types of disks then it is a setting, try popping in a cd, does it play? If so it probably is not a drive problem, but a setting problem, i would suggest contacting the maker of your operating system to find out where to find the setting, or simply googling it.    Good Luck|`|bh5K9Hukaa	well it could be that your desktop might have a virus or your computer may not be able to play DVD's

ZLmpH4dCaa	Most likely the dual will still be faster than almost all applications.  Scaling is not linear.  Going from single to dual is a 'big' jump, going from dual to triple is a smaller jump, and going from triple to quad is an even smaller jump.  Really its almost always better to spend your money on a faster dual core over triple/quadcore cpus.    The two specific CPUs you link to are different generations, one being an Athlon the other a Phenom.  Even though the Phenom is faster at same speed (eg 2.0ghz vs 2.0ghz) 2.1 vs 3.2 is really a large differene.  Phenom is not even close to 50% faster per clock.    Short answer: go for the dual core.|`|xMBzAxFRaa	realistically speaking they would preform the same but go for the triple its got more L2 cache and its a phenom which is way better then an althalon  DC.
8hIUOajLaa	To connect directly from one PC to another, you will need a crossover network cable, and for the first 3 sections of you IP address to be the same, also your subnet should be the same.    For more than one PC I would say buy a switch as it will auto-negotiate the type of connection and cable, same story with IP settings for this.|`|ajvSggX1aa	Connecting all the pcs you want to play with to the same router and create a local game. And all pcs running the game will be able to join and play together.    Can even be done without internet connection using a hub to connect them through ethernet. If you know what Im talking about you should have no problem getting it to work.    So connect them to the same router/hub/switch then get a computer to start a "local game" and get the other pc(s) to join that game.      Good luck  Gumby

l6rSKl46aa	if copyright don't bother since you'll get sued but the way to do it is to rip the dvd, sometimes this occurs not in a compatible format, such as dvd shrink does do this sometimes. if so convert the file to avi using software such as red kawa or imtoo and then upload.... and there you go|`|k4dQsHKkaa	you need a cd/dvd extractor... that will help you extract the movies into clip from your cd/dvd with... http://www.magicdvdripper.com/ - make sure the file format is correct such as wmv, mpg, or avi (else youtube will not accept them).    Then import into moviemaker for editing.      ---for best editing..  use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyrics/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv... finally upload.    or ..

I2FAWBGkaa	Try ebay site|`|dkpIjt5jaa	I would try to find a NEW laptop before looking at used ones as laptops are not built for longevity but portability and you could end up with the problems of the one who sold it to you (no warranties).    I will not suggest a particular model but I will tell you my recommendation to help you decide better:     On the sites listed below, use the way to look by budget (price you are willing to pay) to get choices which won't blow up your wallet.      The first step is to get information on the current laptops and, as a second step, to search online at stores (like BestBuy or similar) for the best deals on the ones you would really like to have based on research.    This way, you get the best working laptops at the best prices.    As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.    At each site, start by checking the current models and then compare them with others by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop.    Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.

Well the used laptop might need repair....depends on how the current owner treats it. A new one is definitely fine.      Well I don't know about 2-3 hour battery of course laptops USED and NEW would have the amount. If it's used don't worry, there will still be enough battery limit because the batter limit never changes on a laptop. An excellent brand I would suggest is:    Windows  Dell  Mac     they are really good programming computer :D good luck with your son.|`|mgiZ0bJ1aa	dont go ebay they rip you off so bad  i doubt your gonna get a laptop with a battery that lasts 2-3 hours  i paid $1300 for mine and it last like an hour an a half fully charged|`|tvy2K59haa	Dell.

uuDloQnCaa	Avast Home Edition:     Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|dkpIjt5jaa	The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.    So just complement by adding what is missing in your computer based on this rule !    Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|9ZuPba4Qaa	in short YES.

b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	Unless you were getting errors or blue screens I don't think the RAM was bad .... I think the problem was having an unpaired DDR2 module.  If you have DDR2 RAM then the third module was forcing the normally dual channel RAM to work on a single channel because DDR2 must be installed in pairs.

Now for the main part: Malware is one of the worst kind of viral infection, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners (which are mostly blind to it) and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    So DON'T take chances with it !!!    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your virus scanner database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    And as a bonus, your computer will be cleaner and probably a bit zippier ( all that for free ! )|`|tOCESHLYaa	I know the one you are talking about it's been showing up alot. Limewire downloads.

You are most likely reading this tutorial because you are infected with some sort of malware and want to remove it. With this knowledge that you are infected, it is also assumed that you examined the programs running on your computer and found one that does not look right. You did further research by checking that program against our Startup Database or by searching in Google and have learned that it is an infection and you now want to remove it.    If you have identified the particular program that is part of the malware, and you want to remove it, please follow these steps.       1.        Download and extract the Autoruns program by Sysinternals to C:\Autoruns       2. Reboot into Safe Mode so that the malware is not started when you are doing these steps. Many malware monitor the keys that allow them to start and if they notice they have been removed, will automatically replace that startup key. For this reason booting into safe mode allows us to get past that defense in most cases.       3. Navigate to the C:\Autoruns folder you created in Step 1 and double-click on autoruns.exe.       4. When the program starts, click on the Options menu and enable the following options by clicking on them. This will place a checkmark next to each of these options.             1. Include empty locations             2. Verify Code Signatures             3. Hide Signed Microsoft Entries       5. Then press the F5 key on your keyboard to refresh the startups list using these new settings.       6. The program shows information about your startup entries in 8 different tabs. For the most part, the filename you are looking for will be found under the Logon or the Services tabs, but you should check all the other tabs to make sure they are not loading elsewhere as well. Click on each tab and look through the list for the filename that you want to remove. The filename will be found under the Image Path column. There may be more than one entry associated with the same file as it is common for malware to create multiple startup entries. It is important to note that many malware programs disguise themselves by using the same filenames as valid Microsoft files. it is therefore important to know exactly which file, and the folder they are in, that you want to remove. You can check our Startup Database for that information or ask for help in our computer help forums.       7. Once you find the entry that is associated with the malware, you want to delete that entry so it will not start again on the next reboot. To do that right click on the entry and select delete. This startup entry will now be removed from the Registry.       8. Now that we made it so it will not start on boot up, you should delete the file using My Computer or Windows Explorer. If you can not see the file, it may be hidden. To allow you to see hidden files you can follow the steps for your operating system found in this tutorial:          How to see hidden files in Windows       9. When you are finished removing the malware entries from the Registry and deleting the files, reboot into normal mode as you will now be clean from the infection.|`|8JQdjSPlaa	Norton sux big time.

FBQZ06vraa	I suggest you put a password on your account, then create a guest account and leave that logged in.  Here's how:    In Windows XP:    1. Click the Start->Control Panel menu item.  2. Click User Accounts.  3. Click your account.  4. Click Create a Password.  5. Create your password.  In spite of the usual advice about not writing down a password, I suggest you DO write it down, then put the slip of paper in your wallet.  It's just too easy to forget a clever password or its exact spelling (capitalization may play a part).    6. For extra protection, you might want to take advantage of the offer to make your files and folders private.  7. After you've created your password, click the Home button at the top of the window to go create the guest account.  8. Click Create a New Account.  9. Give it a name and click Next.  10. Make it a Limited account.  11. Click Create Account.    The steps for Windows Vista are fairly similar.    All that being said, I have to warn you that a savvy techie may still be able to reboot your machine in Safe Mode and get in as Administrator, which does not always have a password.  You might put a password on Administrator as well, by doing the above in Safe Mode.  (Depending on how it was set up, Windows Vista might not have an Administrator account.)  Frankly, I feel leaving an active computer available to a bunch of party-goers is asking for trouble.    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode from the resulting menu with the arrow keys.  4. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  You won't be able to see the Internet, for instance.  Log in as Administrator.  Administrator often has no password.   5. Do the above to password protect Administrator .    6. Finish up and reboot normally.      Hope that helps.|`|ytl2PONXaa	Yes, create an account with the rights of "guest" and have that logged in.|`|LN6AskZhaa	maybe you should create a new user account for them to go on. this way they won't be on your user account looking at your stuff.|`|9ea9deca7763f0c92fda0e22e5325434aa	Long term solution: Buy a external hard drive with encryption software to password protect your documents|`|TAnD8dthaa	create an account with the rights of "guest" and have that logged in  http://www.fashion4biz.com

zorYTX59aa	Contrary to popular myth, you don't "get paid" by just being a YouTube partner.  First, you need an "AdSense" account, and, believe it or not, most partners do  not have one. But even if you did, only in exceptional circumstances, if Google   places "certain" advertisements by your videos, do you "sometimes" get a few   pennies based on 1000s of views, or (more importantly) if people actually click   on the ads beside your videos. Another influential factor is your "channel views".   Do people just watch a couple of your videos, or do they go to your channel to  watch "YOU"? That's why channel views are so important. Just like regular TV,   advertisers pay the networks for their target audience and demographics. They   don't pay the TV show, nor individual episodes. After all, media buyers can not   possibly know the exact content of the next video a partner may come up with.|`|SfuVoSKfaa	Only YouTube partners get paid.

wUqeZl3Saa	The first thing they should say is that you NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE.    Next, talk to someone who can fix the mess. I bet it has happened before.    As far as tracing, it will show someone logged into the system at time and date XYZ and made changes. You see, the nasty part of allowing someone else to know your password is they can more or less impersonate you. The only thing you might be able to prove is if you logged into a computer across the campus somewhere. Then one or the other loggin is bogus.    Admit being stupid with your password and someone can probably fix it. And this isn't hacking technically. Social engineering maybe.

Hnp80pyWaa	1. Firefox (safer and faster than IE, IE SUCKS!)  2. Avast Anti virus (free and great at detecting viruses)  3. CCleaner (deletes temp files and helps to clean the computer)  4. Office|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Security first: The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.    Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions: Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Virus scanners suggestions: Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender. Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.  However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page      Email scanner suggestions: Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/  OR Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...      Cleaner suggestion: Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time. When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).  Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      Now for other things, get OpenOffice, it reads the MS Office files and is FREE: http://download.openoffice.org/index.htm...    You can get help and guides here: http://support.openoffice.org/    After that, buy yourself music and put some in there      There are tons of possibilities !|`|ajvSggX1aa	Itunes, MSN, AVG 8.0, Microsoft Office 2007, DivX, Audacity, OpenOffice.org    http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,209...

If you are not into gaming, and just need something to mess around on, it will work okay.  If you at all play games, you will at least need a graphics card to slap in it.
IuCT3TjGaa	Below can help you speed up your pc:  1. Click Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools  run Disk Cleanup  2. Temporarily close Quick Launch:  Right-click on the Taskbar, click Toolbars, deselect Quick Launch  3. Open My Computer  Right-click on C:  Click Properties  Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)  5. Restart. Right-click on Taskbar, click Toolbars, select Quick Launch to restore    All these things should be done regularly. The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.    Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Does a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/RegCom...|`|rMs4WBfcaa	You need to add ram  Download and run spybot|`|8v6Lq1O5aa	Using a registry cleaner can clean up your computer and then make your computer faster,Why?the reason is that there may be some registry errors and remnant,corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause "computer slow".

044IeGstaa	You could try,    1.Turn the Lexmark off.    2.Unplug it's USB cable from the computer.    3.Go to Start>Hover your mouse cursor on All Programs. Slide over to the Lexmark software. (Lexmark>Lexmark print, ya-da, ya-da) Look for Uninstall. If it's there, click on it, and uninstall the Lexmark software.    4.If not go to Start>Control Panel>Add Remove Programs. After Add Remove Programs loads, look for the Lexmark software. Delete all of it. An uninstall feature for a software program, is the best way to go. Not all have uninstall options though.    5.If it asks you to Restart your computer -> Don't!    6.Close all windows until you're back to your desktop screen. Shut Windows down normally.    7.Unplug the computer from the surge protector. Press the Power On button in, and hold it in for a count of Five seconds, (And I mean FIVE seconds at least. 1001,...1002,..1003,..)  Let go of the Power On button. Do this procedure two more times.    What you're doing here,is clearing your CMOS of any Error Codes, and resetting BIOS back to default settings. (Default settings are those from the factory)    8.Now plug the computer back in. WAIT two minutes. Turn the computer on.    9.After Windows has fully loaded, grab the Lexmark x8350 CD disk, and install it in your optical drive. Re-install the software.    10.If it asks you to restart your computer, do so. If not, do it anyway.    11.After the computer has fully loaded Windows again, plug the USB cable from the Lexmark x8350 back in. Turn the Lexmark on.|`|hYEBdAXhaa	Chickster is spot on, but omitted one important detail you absolutely MUST do before you reboot (do this after step 6): click Start->Run, then type regedit.exe and press  or click the OK button. This will launch the registry editor. Once it loads, expand the HKEY_CURRENT_USER node, then expand the Software node. Scroll down the software manufacturer list and look for a Lexmark node. If one exists, the un-install wizard didn't clean up everything. So, right-click the folder, and select Delete to delete the registry setting. Close the registry editor and alas, now you are ready to re-boot the computer. This should fix you right up. Good luck and all the best.|`|809GpO6Faa	i had the same prob had to upgrade i sugest something not lexmark

A0uqbBTiaa	Wireless N is a newer standard and provides a wider range as well as higher speeds.  It is backward compatible with wireless G.    Wireless G still has good range, and speeds are still faster than your internet connection, so it's still sufficient.    Wireless N is beneficial is you have a large home and a wireless N router.  The higher speeds are useful for transferring files within a local network, but not very useful for internet access.  Most public access points are still using the G standard.|`|jmq2i59Jaa	wireless "N" has NEVER been standardized YET! and what about the "S" wireless that is coming out next year?|`|Cfw0OvLwaa	Wireless N better then G.

If you're talking about losing audio, or internet, or some other hardware function, after reinstalling Windows (which is reinstalling Windows, not rebooting the computer), you didn't install the driver for that piece of hardware.  (You get drivers from the computer manufacturer's site.)

You can also go to your start menu and in the search box on the bottom, type in "msconfig" (without quotation marks) and when the configuration screen pops up choose "start-up" from the tabs on top and check there to see if your sound program is set to start on reboot...    It's really not all that hard...    GOOD LUCK !!!

9ZuPba4Qaa	No you can use a Signal booster in the basement and go wireless .unless you buy another cable service with a separate modem your going wireless.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You can not connect more than one router to the line, they conflict. You need a wireless access point wired to a point nearer your required point, or a wireless range extender place within range of both the router and that point.|`|WDAXieHdaa	I believe there are components that you can get to broaden the range of your cable modem to cover the whole house.  That would be easier to configure and manage then getting two routers to play well together.|`|Rxu7yuMbaa	Contrary to what other posters have said, you could get another router and link it to your existing network, but not as you've described it. Signal boosters might be an easy fix, but the drawback is that your neighbours will get better signal as well.    If you have a router capable of client-mode, you can have it act as repeater for your basement. Since router antennas are usually more sensitive than the ones built into most devices, your signal should be able to be picked up. The setup would then be:    Client-mode router connected to existing router via WiFi.  360 plugged into new client-mode router.    Alternatively, you could look into getting something like Netgear's XE102 bridge which uses the wiring already available in your house: the electrical system. This is something I personally have checked out to solve my own signal-related issues.    ~Cheers~

It would keep the computer on only for about 5 minutes.  It was intended to close it down slowly or give me time to close off programs in case there was a power outage.  You should absolutely have a surge protector for electrical surges.  As for battery backup, be sure to check with the manufacturer to see how long that particular brand will be supported.      I had no benefit from the backup but we very rarely have electrical outages in our area.  Mine was made by APC which has a set of questions you can answer in order to pick the one you want.  I do not intend to purchase another one.      If you can afford it, it certainly won't hurt to have one.

A good surge protector is really all you need.  It will keep lightning from frying your computer, but will not keep it powered up.      A surge protector can be pricey but a battery backup is much more.  If you want to be able to keep using your computer after a power outage then get a battery backup system.

er2VCmiCaa	Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!    The Windows registry, stored on your computer and in several files, records the interaction between hardware, memory space, and addressing. Containing information and settings for all the hardware, software, users, and preferences of your computer, whenever you make a change to the Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes are reflected and stored in the registry. The Windows operating system    continually references this information during its operation.    When the Windows registry becomes very large, your computers can become very slow and it can cause it to be unstable. Some computer users will spend a lot of time and effort going through the registry and trying to fix the slow computer manually. Not only can this be a daunting and frustrating task, it is also a very risky one.    Clean your Registry can make your computer faster  Most computer users find this task confusing and time consuming and those who are not advanced computer experts run the risk of permanently damaging their system by trying to fix their windows registry manually. Using a registry clean and repair application is the fastest, easiest, and safest way to fix a slow computer. While there are a number of registry repair applications available, few offer a comprehensive set of features that enable you to completely clean your registry safely. It is crucial that you choose a Windows registry repair product that you can trust.

T7Apky52aa	It's just a simple matter of cutting out the image you want and pasting it in to the other image. It's going to depend on what kind of quality you want as to which tool you use.     I'm not really familiar with the GIMP but in Photoshop if you want a rough cutout you'd use the lasso tool, but if you wanted something more precise you'd use the pen tool so I'm assuming that the same ideas would hold for the GIMP.    Also in PS I'd put the face on a new layer so that I didn't screw up my orginal picture.

dkpIjt5jaa	Cooling pads are a good idea if you have a self-powered USB hub for them to plug in otherwise it pulls more power out of the laptop making it hotter.    A good propping stand to elevate the back of the machine slightly will help it vent better !    Also check for dust in the fan openings and/or back vent exhaust, get a can of compressed air and aiming it sideways (not full on), shoot some air to blow away dust and other particles.    Your friend's computer may not be exactly the same, fan and vent design change from model to model.      Finally, just check in the control panel if there is a way to have the fans spinning on high and the CPU working at mid/high power instead of just high. ( I did use these settings on a Toshiba laptop that had similar problems and they went away )      Hope this helps|`|kEZP3BmBaa	mnmboy's suggestion is good. Get a cooling pad to put it on.  But before you invest in a cooling pad, I would suggest blowing out the vents. Take a can of compressed air and blow into the fan vents, this will help airflow and it will cool better.  It could be a fan does not work, or does not work well enough. It could be your heatsink is failing because the processor is insulated. But I'd try the can of air first, then a cooling pad, then taking it to a pro if these all fail.|`|hYEBdAXhaa	The vents are all on the bottom, such that when the laptop is on a table or tray, there is nowhere for the heat to vent out - it just builds up until it shuts off.

Good luck and all the best.|`|wfjdYC4Iaa	Are the vents clogged?    You can buy a can of compressed air and blow all the crap out.
g9V18ghbaa	A bittorrent isn't a file you can play. It is only a link to people that have the actual file you are looking for. A bittorrent file is nothing. For you I would recommend bittornado. You can get it from www.bittornado.com. It is a super simple program that opens the bittorent link, asks you where you want to download the actual file that you searched for, and that's it! Once the file is finished downloading, you can open it. You can delete the bittorrent file since you don't need it anymore. It is now just a link to something you already downloaded. Anybody can upload any kind of file for broadcast using some kind of bittorent service, which means any kind of file can be downloaded. For example. If you search for a Kanye West album, someone might of uploaded the album you are looking for with all of the songs packaged in a zip file. Someone else might have packaged it in a rar file, and yet someone else might have just simply uploaded a regular folder with all of the mp3s in it. When you are searching, look for file types that you know you can open. Don't download a dmg file if you don't even know what it is.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you downloaded a file using a torrent program, how you "play" it depends on the file extension (the part of the name to the right of the dot).

Look up "innerHTML"|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you want to do it in PHP (for instance, you need a link that comes from a database), use AJAX to keep from having to refresh the page.  The Javascript to change the element stays the same, it's only the trigger that's different.  (AJAX is pretty boilerplate - there are tutorials, including the boilerplate, all over the web.)|`|SNBG0Y5eaa	This can be done easily in Javascript.    First, your links need to have unique id attributes so it can identify each  element.    In your javascript, you then get the  elements by the id name like this. Replace "xxxx" with the id name.    document.getElementById("xxxx")       That's the first part so you see what it looks like. Then add the method to change the link. The 'yyyy' is the new URL.    document.getElementById( "xxxx" ).setAttribute( 'href', 'yyyy' );    That's the whole statement, but it's better programming practice to break it down, so it typically looks like this. ("link1 can be any variable name")    var link1 = document.getElementById("xxxx");  link1 = setAttribute('href', 'yyyy');    That's the statement how to change the link.  You will need to structure it on what triggers the change, such as putting the statement in a function that gets called by whatever event you want to trigger the change.
CArpIOkAaa	In my personal experience, uTorrent has been the best program for it. It is much faster than any of the other ones out there like BitTorrent. Its actually the Greek letter that looks like a u, but just type in uTorrent on Google. Also, on www.portforward.com, there is a way you can set it up with the guides they provide. (I've tried it but I haven't gotten success with it, maybe you will). It makes uTorrent even faster. Good luck! :) Oh yea, I hope you're using www.demonoid.com and not some crappy torrent site like thepiratebay.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	uTorrent is well-written and it's small (6MB), so it loads fast and it doesn't bog your computer down.|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	actually they are all the same. it really depends on the availability of the torrent.|`|AnFmu1xVaa	utorrent.... its just good

WeZcSZvKaa	I'm afraid it is just your imagination. When you delete something all you do is put the link to the program into the bin folder. The actual program or data files are still fully in tact on the drive.     Basically nothing changes, because if you restore from the bin all it does is restore the link.    However when you delete them from the bin, all the system then does is mark the space where they are as free space so that it can be overwritten. That's why stuff can still be recovered before it is!    So no again it is your imagination. It's also a fallacy when people say to make your computer faster delete all the programs, blah, blah, blah.

My guess is that these are different companies that send you the cd, you try it but you have a limited time to decide if you want to keep it. if you don't send it back then they assume that you want the program and therefore subscribe to there offer.  The only way to clear it up is to call the company, they'll tell you to send it back and then you can argue with them about getting your money back, but be prepared for a fight!

sGEzZCP1aa	5 Simple Ways To Increase Your Computer Speed    If you're a computer expert, you'll probably already know about these tips (hopefully this will provide you with a little reminder). If you're not an expert, don't worry - these tips are simple, and don't require a lot of computer experience.    While an old computer will never operate at the same speed as a newer (and bigger & faster) computer, you can help your computer stay as "young & healthy" as possible.    1) Disk Cleanup    Performing a disk cleanup regularly is a good idea. Whenever you "surf the internet", open attachments, delete files, your computer saves a record of your activity. Many of these files are harmless, and individually are very small. But if you spend a lot of time on your computer, before long you'll take up enough space to slow your computer down a bit.    Disk Cleanup is a Windows utility that helps keep unused and unwanted files from taking up extra storage space on your computer. You can think of it as "spring cleaning for your computer.    Basically, it removes files that may have once been useful or used but now are just taking up extra room that could be used for more useful programs and files.    To perform a disc cleanup, click on the Start button on the bottom left of your computer screen, then Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disc Cleanup. A small box will pop up, allowing you to select the files to delete (most files are OK to delete, but if you are unsure, it is best to not select the file). Then click OK, and the unused files will be removed.    If you've never done a disk cleanup on your computer, now is a good time to get started. Then, depending on how much you use your computer, you can perform a disk cleanup every few weeks to keep your computer running smoothly!    2) Defragmenting Your Computer    Another way to improve the performance of your computer is to defragment your hard drive. What is defragmenting, and why do you need to do it? Here's a simple explanation:    Basically, defragmenting is putting files back where they belong. With the files in the proper order, your computer will run more efficiently.    You don't need to hire a computer expert to defragment your computer. It's simple to do. You just need to plan ahead, because if you have a lot of "stuff" on your computer, it could take a while.    And it's best not to use your computer while defragmenting.    Not sure how to defragment your computer? You can either click on your computer's help file (Click the "Start" button on the bottom left of your computer screen, then Help), or click on Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Defragment - for most computers) .    Keep in mind that the actual wording is slightly different depending on the operating system you use (Windows 95, 98, XP, etc) so you might need to refer to your computer's help file.    Periodically defragmenting your computer will keep it running smoothly!    3) Removing Spyware & Adware    If you've ever had spyware or adware on your computer, you know how frustrating it can be - strange things happening, your homepage changing, inappropriate popups, unfamiliar icons...  What exactly is spyware or adware?    Simply, files that are often downloaded onto your computer without your knowledge (or at least without you knowing what they really are).    Unfortunately, many of these programs "sneak" their way onto your computer, so avoiding them entirely is difficult, especially if you spend a lot of time on your computer, surfing the Internet and downloading new programs and files.    Fortunately, there are ways to remove these unwanted files from your computer.    Here are 2 adware/spyware removal programs that are simple to use (and both are free):  Ad-Aware >http://www.lavasoftusa.com/support/download/http://www.lavasoftusa.com/support/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoftusa.com/support/downl...  Spybot >http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.htmlhttp://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/en/downl...    Why does adware/spyware continue to be such a problem? Because most of these programs make money for the people creating and spreading them, unfortunately. So, all we can do is try to avoid them as much as possible, and to remove them when they do find their way onto our computers.    If you do find spyware on your computer, don't panic. In many cases, you just have some extra "junk" on your computer. But keeping spywaer and adware off of your computer will help it run more quickly and efficiently.    4) Uninstalling Old & Unused Programs    While uninstalling old, unused programs will help speed up your computer, removing the wrong files can cause you some big problems. So, please proceed carefully. And if you are not comfortable, please ask for help from someone you know who is more knowledgeable.    Most programs that you download simply have an "uninstall" feature that comes with them. If you're like me and you download a lot of free programs or free trials, after a while your computer begins to slow down. That means|`|4QmgVhS5aa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.

Every time you install and uninstall software on your computer and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry.over time, the registry can grow to enormous proportions, especially if the various programs you've installed do not do a good job of deleting and/or updating it's Registry entries.You need to scan and clean your computer with registry cleaner to make it fast.Good Registry Cleaner will improve your computer and Internet performance dramatically!

zLUQJxJkaa	It is not illegal to own it. It isn't illegal to use it unless you are the host-type-thing or whatever. What IS illegal is distribution. This means that the people who give out stuff (that's copyrighted) on Limewire are doing something illegal. You loading it is not, HOWEVER you can accidentally do something illegal: not deleting all files you used on Limwire once you've loaded what you want can give other people access to them (in which case you would be the distributor, therefor committing a crime).  Using it that way is not illegal, however it is very dishonest and I highly suggest not doing it.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Not to add, that you can get some nasty *** viruses on your computer dispite how good you think your virus protection is|`|LxMP5mYhaa	Its not illegal to own it,  but to download anything, yes.

nkTEhBTyaa	I think... Bad cause  people who don't want to be on it could accdently be put in there and good cause its fun i make youtube vids|`|rRgS4ss9aa	Youtube is bad and good at the same time because it can be informational but addicting. Youtube helps many students (and probably people) procrastinate because of it's wide variety of videos that have been accumulated from all around the world. The most interesting thing is how Youtube has a personal touch, because most videos are home-made and voiced with the user's opinion. That, mixed with human's integrity to know more about the world, equals addiction. However, Youtube is also informational because it has many medical videos and such. There are many cases where an individual has learned the answer of an academic question just because they "saw it on youtube." So depending on one's opinion and use of Youtube, the stance of Youtube being good and bad could alternate based on personal use.

A0uqbBTiaa	Turn on file and printer sharing and share the printer, connect to the shared printer with the laptop.    I can give you very specific instructions if you tell me what operating systems you're using on the computers (e.g. Vista, XP, Linux...)    Edit:    On the XP computer    Go to Control Panel and select Network Setup Wizard    Go through the Wizard, accept the defaults up to the "File and printer sharing" step, note the Workgroup name (should be MSHOME by default).  Select the radio button next to "Turn on file and printer sharing" and click Next, when it's done, select "Just finish the wizard:..." and Next, then Finish.      You can share files, folders, and printers by right clicking on them and selecting "Sharing" or "Sharing and Security".  You can find your printers under Control Panel>Printers and Faxes.    On the Vista computer    You'll find the settings for file and printer sharing at this location:    Control Panel > Network and Internet > File and Printer Sharing    It's pretty obvious what to do there, just checkboxes and radio buttons to do what you want to do.      Make sure your workgroup is MSHOME (or whatever the workgroup on XP was).  Go to Control Panel and open System and Maintenance.  If you need to change the workgroup, select Change Settings and click the Change button to change the workgroup.    Again, you can right click files, folders, or printers you want to share and select Sharing to share them.    To connect to one computer from another    On XP    Go to "My Network Places".  In the left pane you'll see View workgroup computers, click that.  You'll see both the computer you're on, and the other computer in the workgroup.  Double click on the computer to see the shared resources.  Double click on a printer to connect to it, this will install the printer from that computer as a network printer.  You can access shared resources like files and folders just as you would on a local drive, you can map a network drive by right clicking on a shared folder on the remote machine and selecting "map network drive", this will bring up a dialog box allowing you to assign that resource a drive letter that will show up under My Computer.  Start at the back of the alphabet.    On Vista    Go to Network and you should see the computers in the workgroup.  From there, the procedures are the same for connecting to network shares.    NOTE:    If you're using a 3rd party firewall, such as Norton 360's firewall, you may have problems connecting to the computer.  The easiest fix for this is to disable the third party firewall and use Windows Firewall instead.|`|cBT6Qrbhaa	if your printer is hooked up to a computer on your network it can be shared out for the network.  The printer does not have to be wireless.  Once you connect the printer to the computer share the printer out    Now make all pcs and wireless clients on the same workgroup so they can communicate.  Now when you connect wirelessly you should be able to go to My network Places and browse for shared printer.  you can also add it from the printer prompt by using the path to the shared printer:  \\COMPUTER1\HP_PRINTER
j3Px4JXfaa	Hi vistal1,    Im Ron from the Windows Outreach Team. Thought Id just pop on for a sec and drop off a link that might help those who have installed the Beta.    Youre right on one front; Windows 7 is a Beta and therefore shouldnt be run as if its a publicly-released OS. There will be bugs and issues to address  thats what a Beta is for. Without Beta testers out there using the OS as they do every day, Microsoft wouldnt be able to make the tweaks needed for a market-ready product.    The best advice I can give people running the Beta is that they follow the guidelines for backing up their systems and make sure they read, understand and follow the directions from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    I know your question wasnt much of a question that needed an answer, but I hope this helps anyone else out.    Cheers,  Ron  Windows Outreach Team|`|go18cJRHaa	Windows 7 is the next version of the Windows Client operating system. Designed based on your feedback, it will make everyday tasks faster and easier, make your PC work the way you want it to, and make new things possible.  Cathy|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	I'm not. And will never install it. Period. I have Linux and Open Office & Firefox, why in the world would I need Windows 7? Nevermind that it's a Beta or testing version, even if they have the Alpha or so-called "final version", I still won't install it. Why? So I can mess up my computer? Hell no.    Who the L gave me a thumbs down?|`|LxMP5mYhaa	I made the mistake of installing it.  All it did was crash and freeze.  To answer your question though,   people are using it just to try new things.  For a techie such as I,   its like standing out there at midnight for that movie release.  Hope that makes sense, and i do completely agree with your post.|`|pqqJ5krjaa	Because even though its a beta, its still better than the pos that is windows vista(go effin figure).|`|HEfXwR7faa	I installed it (actually using it now) because I work in computer/software support, and it's a wonderful thing to be ahead of your clients as far as new operating systems and technology go.    I also run it and provide feedback so that, before the release date, they can iron out any issues with the operating system before it goes to market, producing a better product for the actual end users. it was an excellent strategy for microsoft to offer a public beta, and I believe this will be the best product ever released by them.     People that are skewed to not liking it without even seeing it should not be running it anyway, as they are not considered proper testing partners. It's actually quite stable, and worked with everything I have thrown at it so far (also boots up in 18 seconds from SSD)|`|pSW4nvGJaa	People are installing it because they want to see how it is & who cares its there computer there gonna screw up. So it don't matter.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Don't be so paranoid. I installed it on Microsoft Virtualpc 2007sp1 and everything is fine. Besides with virtual machine if something goes wrong, then all you have to do is delete it. It doesn't harm the host system at all. And Win7 is pretty cool, stable, faster and better then Vista. Though I couldn't play any games on it because Vm only allowed me 1gig of memory, I can't wait for the final release. I'm sold on it.

Facebook is more personal. It's better for privacy and better at finding people you might already know. It has a more professional, mature feel to it.    MySpace is more for socializing, meeting new people, and promoting yourself.     People say Facebook is easier to get a hang of. You could start off with a Facebook and if you want to expand yourself than try out MySpace. If you end up not liking one or the other, you always have the choice of deleting the profile. So just check it out and get a feel of things.    I myself am more of a MySpace person.  I like being able to customize the whole look and feel of my profile to show more of my personality than my facebook lets me.

Also, WEP, WPA, WPA-2 can all be broken into easily, but unless your friend is a hacker or loves computers,  you shouldn't have to worry about using WPA2, which is the best. WEP is the weakest.

In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

CArpIOkAaa	AVG Free Edition. Download it from their site www.avg.com. If you have trouble there, just download it by searching on Google.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.    So just complement by adding what is missing in your computer based on this rule !    Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|uuDloQnCaa	Avast Home Edition:     Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.

Your 7050 is not a video card, its a graphics processor, and it's not expandable.  Get the video with the PCI-Express slot.  Make sure you have correct power suply for the 9 Series. Those things use a lot of energy. Usualy 450.
9ZuPba4Qaa	Sorry with out a Recovery cd your screwed . You are going to call gateway and see if they can send you a recovery disk DONT tell them you installed a Beta OS. This is why you need to read you manual. It clearly states YOU NEED to make your own recovery cds with the recovery WIZARD in Xp. Windows 7 IS NOT A Full OS it is BETA .|`|j3Px4JXfaa	Hi Joshua A,    My names Ron. I work on the Windows Outreach Team.    Some laptops that were shipped without actual discs have had this problem.  Id suggest checking this page for next steps: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246. Its the Microsoft support site and can get you on the road to obtaining a recovery disc.    Also, depending on the manufacturer of your laptop and when it was purchased, you may have recovery software located in a partition on your hard drive. Did you notice a partition in your drive when you were installing Windows 7?    You won't have any luck using a disc that you create from another computer, sorry.    I hope this helps a bit. Feel free to reach out if you have anything else.    Cheers,  Ron
CArpIOkAaa	Instead, use VLC Media player. It plays nearly, if not all, video and audio types. Just download it by searching for it on Google.
hXaq6JZ2aa	Limewire has limited torrent capabilities, I would go with Utorrent or something (optional). Just a suggestion, but back to the question.    Torrent sites do not test for viruses, but normally if the person who created the torrent is trusted, then the chances of getting a virus is very low. It works like this - The original person who created the torrent lets people download the file. The people who download the file have the option to upload it from their computer so the original person does not need to keep uploading. If you are downloading a torrent, it's coming from multiple people in little parts. Someone might put a virus in there, but it may just be a little part and therefore not much of a threat.    Common torrent sites (use a search engine) include     -Mininova   -ISOhunt   -Thepiratebay     These sites have trusting comments (if there are more than 5-10).Torrents are obviously a way people can illegally distribute files, and you can get arrested. Make sure you do not take part in such actions.    Oh, and if you are still unsure of viruses, I recommend avast! or AVG. You can use them to scan what you download. Both, you can find through a search engine.    It's all about trusting a community. If you download anime (non-licensed I hope =P), those people you can usually trust. I have downloaded 50GB worth of files since the beginning of winter, and no viruses yet ;). Hope this helps!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The sites are completely safe - .torrent files are text files, giving you links to trackers that list the files you want to download.  It's the files you want to download that aren't safe.    Tested?  You're downloading from other users like you.  Do you test the files you download?  (You're a download source for other users.  As you connect "to the internet" the tracker you connect to lists the files you have available for download.  That's what you're downloading - files others have available.)    Downloading files from strangers is like having unprotected sex with strangers - it's inherently unsafe.  There's no "safe" site to recommend.|`|UfELDZoMaa	If you get a Virus consider yourself lucky.    They are doing more than viruses now. A lot of this stuff is being tracked down way more aggressively now by internet policing.     Yes! people go to jail for this and people pay HUGGGE fines for this.     I'm not talking 100 dollars or 1000 dollars. I'm talking in the range of 5000-10,000 dollars.     When you think about it, thats some serious ****. It's not worth getting buster over some songs.

wiJz0FYLaa	Ignore the Windows defragmenter's suggestions. You computer being 5 years old can definitely benefit from a defrag if you haven't done so in a while.    Infact, you can do the following to improve the speed of your system. May take a while, but be patient.    ==Please backup your data before you proceed, since your system is so old, you never know if it has started developing hardware problems==    Assuming you have no hardware problems, do this:    (1) Run a FULL anti-virus scan with a good virus scanner. Get free editions of AVast or Antivir. Use the latest virus definitions file. But don't install or run more than one anti-virus at the same time.    (2) Run anti-spyware scans with Spybot S&D and malwarebytes.    (3) Ensure all Microsoft security updates are applied.    (4) Run disk cleanup to delete old temp files and other junk    (5a) Run chkdsk once to scan for file system errors. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265    (5b) Run  a thorough disk defrag. Use a good defragmenter for this, and also run a boot-time defrag to fix the MFT and page file if they are fragmented. You can check out Diskeeper 2009, which is widely acknowledged to be the best defragger around. Their website has free 30-day trial versions. http://www.diskeeper.com    (6) Disable unnecessary background processes and services that take up memory.    (7) Make sure all the hardware components have the latest and most stable drivers. Video card performance in particular is strongly dependent on drivers.     Good Luck!|`|TIsaugglaa	Did you check for spyware?  that can slow a computer down quite a bit, seeing as spyware come in hordes XD  if not, try spybot search and destroy, i think it works pretty well.|`|yiE2Mhjyaa	It's most likely that your drivers are out of date and need to be updated. My advise is to download the free version of RadarSync and scan your computers drivers. This program has worked great for me.  Link http://www.radarsync.com/|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	First we have to know where it's slow.  Are you talking about Windows starting up?  Are you talking about the time it takes for a program to start running onece yo start it?  Are you talking about programs running slow?  Are you talking about your internet connection being slow?    Those are all different problems and, other than the computer just being slow, they all have different causes.  Applying the fix for a problem you don't have won't cure the problem you do have.    Siince modern computers are about 30 times more powerful than yours (computer power doubles every year - at least), programs have become larger and less efficient, which means that they need larger, faster computers to run on.  Your computer may just be too old to run current programs at a decent speed.    We'd need to know what's slow, and the specs for the computer - CPU type and speed and the amount of RAM, at least.|`|T7Apky52aa	Try running CCleaner http://www.ccleaner.com and JK Defrag http://www.kessels.com/Jkdefrag/    If that doesn't do what you're after, then try adding more memory.|`|Vcte2eUtaa	3 Recommendable free downloads to keep your PC performing well.

peFufWeYaa	Yes, not much I can add to that. It is not really a part but refers to the design of the motherboard, as in how fast a memory it can use, or type of cpu, or how fast your cpu can access your video card or IDE connection. You can, depending on the nature of the bus, use a faster memory or video card or overclock the cpu or perhaps use a upgraded driver for your motherboard, but the term generally refers to the design of the motherboard and not to a specific piece of hardware you can look at|`|bxlYleZkaa	It is a design feature of the motherboard rather than any physical item. It means that data can be moved around in certain ways quickly, often between similar devices or ports, such as the USBs.|`|8Js8GyACaa	A system bus is used to move data around between copmuter components.

A0uqbBTiaa	The only way to do this is to have the cable company run another line to the house.  You can't run 2 modems on the same feed.

I play xbox online while my bro plays on the comp and my friend is watching a movie.|`|rbR6ePRRaa	You can't have 2 connections used by the same modem... however you could have 2 different providers.      The lag is most likely because of the nature of cable modems,  a cable modem takes 1 length of coaxil cable and stretches it from the nearest multiplexer (    Solution: Go fibre (check to see if verizon fios is available in your area),  fibre cannot be split, and for the price it is amongst the best mb/s per-dollar you can buy (I pay about 29.99 / month for my 10mbps down/4.5mbps up with verizon fios).    Good luck.

yTD84yFlaa	Yes you would need an installation of Windows; typically you should have your old version of Windows to return to.  So basically you just need to grab your old installation CD, and use the key on the back of your PC.  If you didn't get an installation CD when you first got your PC:    ----    Finally, if you really, honestly and truly want to re-install windows, the first step would be to run your installation CD. If you don't have one, you may have an image of the CD on your hard disk. In the I386 directory are two files:        * winnt32.exe is the "32 bit" version of the character mode Windows setup. You may be able to run this from within Windows.      * winnt.exe is the "16 bit" version of the character mode Windows setup. Why a 16 bit version? If you can't run winnt32.exe and are able to boot from an MS-DOS floppy or are able to boot to Win9x DOS mode, then this setup program will work for you.    WARNING: character.exe and winnt32.exe are the "start-from-scratch", "do-it-all-over-setup" programs. Use them only if you want a complete re-install of Windows - possibly losing any prior custom configuration changes you'character made, depending on whether setup is installing on top of and can understand a prior installation.    ----    There is no 'free' way to get Windows; if there was a FREE way, then there would be no reason for Microsoft to distribute them for hundreds of dollars.|`|ykXzzx65aa	U get it free when u buy your comp|`|0QWfdxrfaa	Only way is to pirate it and that is illegal.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Yes, you will, as well as any other software you want on it.  Windows is not free; you'll need to purchase it if you didn't get a copy of it when you bought your computer.|`|iT9OuNTjaa	When you whipe your hard drive, it deletes EVERYTHING.  Including windows.  Yes, you will need to reinstall windows.  If you had the cd than you just stick it in and follow the instructions.  But if you're looking to get a free copy.  The only way you could get a legal free copy is to call microsoft and tell them that you need one and they'll ask you info like if you bought the computer new and if so where was it shipped to or bought from and wat your name is and they will want serial numbers and model.  So unless you bought the pc brand new with windows installed i doubt they will give you a cd.  The only other way is to get one illegally.  Which is well.  like i just said.  illegal and not safe.  You couldn't even use it long if you didn't activate it.  Hope this helps
A0uqbBTiaa	1. Do you know what it is?    Yes.    2. If yes, do you support it? or oppose it?    I support it.    3. Why do you support or why don't you support it?

7982e56b45af684f2c57a5d2fa899f87aa	It is possible that NORTON did find some problems/virus on your computer, but I really doubt if it found as many as 49. Companies on the internet use scare tactics to get you to purchase there products, they use a false since of "insecurity to make it seem that the problems with your computer are urgent and should not be neglected. And, because of these reasons I would not even purchase that particuliar security suite.   There are far better Security Suites available that do much better jobs of securing your machine. I have used virtually all of the suites available and have found that the best in the business is Kaspersky.  You can even download a free trial from KASPERSKY and see for yourself. Go to http://www.kaspersky.com/downloads for a free 30 day trial. I am certain that after running this scan from Kaspersky you will not see all this crap that NORTON says is on your computer, Try it! Also, as the other answers have suggested , you should install spyware detection on your computer , like superantispyware, and malawarebytes. These are free to download and use and do a spectacular job at detecting and freeing you machine of adaware and spyware    http://www.kaspersky.com/downloads|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	No.  Most of the time, downloading programs like this is actually a form of spyware and will cause more problems after you install it than it will actually help.     Go to lavasoft.com.  This works great on my computer and should get rid of the Norton advertisement that is spyware in itself.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Sounds a lot of viruses, I'd double-check with one or more of these free online scanners:  NOD32: http://www.eset.com/onlinescan/  BitDefender: http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html  F-Secure: http://support.f-secure.com/enu/home/ols...    I suspect it's finding cookies and other minor stuff which are pretty harmless. Even if you have got 49 viruses I wouldn't buy Norton 360, to be frank.|`|kr3PzD5baa	DONT BUY NORTON, it prevents viruses by SUPER slowing down your computer|`|vA07XhcKaa	Go to Lavasoft.com  Download their free 30 day trial.

Elobl7qdaa	Just because the driver was installed, doesn't mean it is working. I take it you inserted it into your computer as a slave. Also, check Device manager and see if there are any Yellow/Red flags for it.    There are external IDE cases with built-in power supply that you can use. The drive then connects to the USB port. Somewhat slow, but if the drive gets recognize, you can explore it with Windows Explorer and latter use it as a small storage drive.    Ron

For the most part, if you hardly never use them or never at all, they just die. They last longer if used frequently. I've went through many, and i think it's because I Just never used them. CD roms are relatively inexpensive to buy or replace now. 20-30 dollars max and DVD roms maybe around 40 max.  Computer stores will have them too, might have some used ones for 15 dollars or less. Just depending on the store. They're relatively easy to take out. Basically unscrewing some screws and connecting 2-3 cables to it, just remember the cables that were in the old CD rom when you switch it out with the new one.  Basically one for power, the other cable that goes directly to the computer and the 3rd for audio. Once again, just match up the cables. You can get CD rom drives at WalMart for pretty cheap.

DjGEJfaPaa	Any method designed to stop visitors from downloading images can be circumvented by a person with the right set of technical skills.    Once you understand and accept the fact that you cannot stop people from copying your images online, you still might want to try and slow them down. There are a few different roadblocks you can place between your images and their audience.    Webmasters wanting to prevent visitors from downloading their images often employ two different tactics: disabling the ability to right-click, and overlaying the image with a transparency. Both methods attempt to prevent visitors from right-clicking on your images in order to save them.    Right-clicking your mouse button (or CTRL-clicking on a Mac) brings up a context menu containing a few options that apply to whatever element you have right-clicked on. One of these options is save as, and allows you to save any right-clicked image. There are many different JavaScripts that attempt to disable right clicking. These scripts work to an extent  any visitor savvy enough to disable JavaScript in their web browser can circumvent this method.    Webmasters may also overlay their images with a second, transparent graphic in order to stop visitors from downloading the original. The visitor intends to right-click on the image they see, but in reality they are right-clicking on the transparent image placed over it. Some visitors may be confused when they realize they have downloaded an invisible image, but others will persist. The overlay method can be defeated by taking a screenshot and then cutting out the desired image with Paint, PhotoShop, or another photo editing program.    Users may also want to include visual elements to discourage visitors from saving their images. Two widespread aesthetic roadblocks are the use of watermarks, and the use of low-quality images.|`|44IT2kmNaa	No way to do it. When the image is displayed it is downloaded onto the client's machine.

No matter what you do via the internet.  Someone can always just ctrl print screen and volia.  They have a copy of your photo.    So your best bet is to place a watermark on the copies of your photos.  That way anytime someone makes a copy, anyone who sees the photo's knows its yours.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I don't know if you can disable them, and even if you could, people could still take a screen shot (with a specific program or just by copying and pasting after hitting "print screen") and then crop the picture if they really wanted it. I agree with the comment about a large watermark - that is probably your safest bet. Good luck!|`|RLIIhxDhaa	I don't think you can disable them if you are that concerned about copying you should watermark them.|`|TclyXi8qaa	Not really because no matter what you do they'll always be able to print screen and copy the screen onto paint and then just take the picture like that! xxx

XK1rmR0Gaa	If you only want the user to run from the EXE, there is no need to publish the project. You would simply copy the contents of the bin\debug or bin\release folder if you've already compiled it and use a batch file with an xcopy command (and possibly an autorun.inf) to copy the files to the location that you want it to be and create any shortcuts. The program could also be run from the folder.

Changing the drive letter on one PC will not mean that it will be the same drive letter on another.  Hope this helps.

Once you get to the store you will see several options to choose from, and they will say things like Wireless N or G, and maybe still B.  You are more than welcome to speak to the sales rep for more insight but i recommend either Wireless G or N.    once you bring your brand new pretty router home, connect your cable modem to the port on the router labeled WAN via a Ethernet cable...looks kind of like a phone cord but fatter.  For more detail i would defiantly not be afraid to pull out the instruction manual with your router it should give pretty simple step by step.    once your all hooked up you should be broadcasting a wireless signal (granted it is probably not secure...meaning there is no password so potentially anyone in the area could borrow your internet connection, to configure your router settings once again refer to that manual you received with your router.)    now on your laptop, i assume it has vista if its new, open up start menu right click on network and select properties, it will open a window called network and sharing center.  on the upper left corner there is a couple of options to select, one would be connect to a wireless network. once you open that up you should have a new entry labeled most likely the brand name of your router with several numbers after it. (unless you changed it in your router settings...once again refer to the manual... blah blah blah)    okay this could be a little confusing and i don't think im the best at breaking it down and explaining it but if i make a little sense to you then i am happy!      as far as can you have internet anywhere, yes...sort of, most coffee shops and restraunts, library's, hotels, etc offer free WIFI, that lets you use your laptop on the go!

yHI6rfeUaa	From your unclear writing, it appears as though the mount bracket that links the processor fan to the processor is faulty.  Replace it with a properly sized unit.    Secondly, if things remain warm, install a fan to pull air through the box.  If it has one now, adding a second will help.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Are you saying the fixing bracket for the heat sink to the CPU is broken. Are you also saying you have laid the fan down or it is not properly attached. Get it to an expert which you obviously are not before you need a new CPU and quite probably a new M/board.

I've never seen a program that teaches you HTML, but there are several WYSIWYG editors that generate the code for you.      Just search the internet for HTML tutorials, there are tons of websites that can help you, unless you don't want to learn HTML and just download one of the free What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get web page editors|`|tsjLHXzUaa	There are countless websites online that teach HTML, among many other languages. I am calling your bluff.  You are not having troubles... unless, if by troubles you mean that you dont want to try.    I hate it when people tell me to "Google it". But in your case, I will tell you to.  I could look up purple frogs on google and I will probably find something on web design|`|gzLzzIZLaa	Other than HTML code, you could try several style of designing.    1) Graphic designing by the means of pictures decorating your website.  2) Flash designing, by using flash animation, it will be definitely better than GIF images as it has a smoother frame rate.    So basically, maybe you can try something to aid with your template designing.
zqfs7A6Caa	I'm sorry to say, but some software that was made before the release of Windows Vista will not work on a computer running Windows Vista.

fktu5vLYaa	You can record video with any camera. The old camera is recorded in dv, a new - in a dvd format or trasport stream. You can also search the camera, which immediately write avi (must be supported mpeg4).     In the first two cases, a problem arises when transferring files via the Internet, because file should be in one of the standard formats (for example AVI).   In DV cameras that require a special program for capturing DV. In addition, the DV file will need to convert to avi.   DVD camera record to the disk or flash, in this case must have the program for converting DVD to AVI.  For converting video from dvd (or dv) to avi you can use axara video converter.

SAgCy83Oaa	Myspace, like Yahoo and similar "social" sites do not have the resources (read: people) to police all the content that pops up on these pages.  So it's never a case of "allowing" ads like that to appear.  I am sorry that your Christianity is not yet strong enough to protect you from worries and confusions over such trivial matters as the 2012 foolishness.  (That one is merely a lot of lies and exaggerations about the simple matter of an ancient Mayan calendar coming to the end of it's cycle - because the Mayans couldn't conceive that they might need a better calendar if that had survived this long.)  In the Bible, even Jesus says that no one can know when his second coming will occur, so all these foolish forecasts (you're old enough to remember all those false prophecies about the end of the millenium) are merely that - foolishness.  There is no way any such "lottery" could be of any value.    I don't think there's any way to know, but there are signs that the average age of people on this particular website might be about age 16.

For this purposes I use axara video converter|`|uLVgHhAgaa	Because windows movie maker only supports these file formats for movie and videos:  Video files: .asf, .avi, .wmv     Movie files: MPEG1, .mpeg, .mpg, .m1v, .mp2    Your phone.... chances are it records in mp4, or .3gp    There is plenty of software out there that is download able and free so you can convert video files    Just google "convert .3gp into .wmv"    Hope this helps  -Josh
DjGEJfaPaa	Download and scan with Malwarebytes and/or SUPERAntiSpyware.    Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware are the best anti-spyware applications available (you can have more than one). Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.    If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.    Running virus removal programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective. The idea behind the Safe Mode is that the operating system would only load your essential programs and drivers to the memory and hence there is a high chance that the virus-infected file is on the drive but not loaded into memory.     I strongly recommend using Firefox as your primary Web browser, It is safer and beter than Internet Explorer. Get the add-on NoScript for Firefox to prevent click-jacking. The AdBlock Plus extension will allow you to surf virtually ad-free.|`|ieVmY8TCaa	Before you use any virus scanners (Which you probably need) try this    Go into the safe mode    Start  Run now enter    %TEMP%   Click ok  Now delete all to include hidden folders if it asks you|`|NkbhHcIAaa	when you are done  trying all these other WORTHLESS answers contact me and I'll help you remove it|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Wow. Three days. Really?    It would be better to just reinstall Windows. It takes less than three days, and then you'll be sure all malware is gone.    After you've done that, get some real security instead of AVG and Ad-Aware.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Go to http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/malware-... instructions on how to remove many of the currently active Malware programmes.

I'm afraid it is too tall for your slim-tower case.   Looking over the specifications of the Dell Dimension 4600C, I noticed the power supply has only 160 Watts*. As far as I know, there are no modern graphics cards that will work with a power supply that has so few Watts.   If you are going to go shopping for a graphics upgrade for your system (which is a very good idea) please keep the minimum power supply requirement of the card in mind. Even a decent card like the HD 3450 needs a 300 Watt power supply.  I wish I had better news. Sorry.

This article describes how to partition (prepare) and format a hard disk before you install Windows XP using the Windows XP Setup program. This article also contains things to consider before you partition or format your hard disk, and links to resources that can help you troubleshoot if problems occur. This article is intended for an advanced user.    You can use other methods to partition and format the hard disk before you install Windows XP, such as the Fdisk and Format tools. For additional information about how to use Fdisk and Format to partition and format your hard disk, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:  255867  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/255867/ ) How to use the Fdisk tool and the Format tool to partition or to repartition a hard disk  If your computer is already running Windows XP, and you want to create partitions other than the System or the Startup partitions, you can use the Windows XP Disk Management tools.

Before you partition and format the hard disk  Before you partition and format your hard disk, make sure that you do the following:  Prepare the hard disk according to the manufacturer's instructions  If you are using a SATA hard disk, skip this step and go to the "Determine the type of file system that you want to use" section. If you are using an IDE hard disk, set the jumpers and the cabling according to the role of the hard disk (for example, master or subordinate) and make any required BIOS (or CMOS) changes. To set the jumpers and cabling, and make any required BIOS or CMOS changes, see the documentation that was included with your hard disk and motherboard, or contact the manufacturers.  Determine the type of file system that you want to use  You can use either the NTFS or FAT file systems. NTFS is the preferred file system to format the hard disk unless you want to run an earlier version of Windows that cannot read NTFS partitions. For additional information about the differences between the FAT and NTFS file systems, click the following article numbers to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:  100108  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100108/ ) Overview of FAT, HPFS, and NTFS file systems  310525  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310525/ ) Description of the FAT32 file system in Windows XP  If the hard disk already contains data, back it up  Make sure that you back up all your important data before you continue. When you partition and format a hard disk, all the data on that partition is permanently deleted. You can view current partition information without deleting your data. For additional information about how to use the backup utility or the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard, click the following article numbers to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:  320820  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/320820/ ) How to use the Backup utility to back up files and folders in Windows XP Home Edition  309340  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309340/ ) How to use Backup to restore files and folders on your computer in Windows XP  293118  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/293118/ ) How to use the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard  306186  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306186/ ) How to use the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard from CD-ROM  306187  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306187/ ) How to use the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard Disk in Windows XP  If the hard disk has a drive overlay or a disk management program, make sure that it is compatible  If your computer uses drive overlay software for large hard disk support, do not use the Windows XP Setup program to partition or to format the drive until you have verified that Windows XP is compatible with the software. If you have drive overlay software installed, contact the software manufacturer to find out whether it is compatible with Windows XP. If you are not sure whether you have drive overlay software installed, contact the manufacturer of your hard disk drive or motherboard.  If you have software that you want to reinstall, verify that you have the disks  Make sure that you have the original CDs or floppy disks so that you can reinstall the software programs after you partition and format your drive. If you purchased an upgrade for a program, make sure that you have the full version of the original program. Many upgrades for programs require a compliance check before you can install the upgraded product. If you c|`|wlRqQGRBaa	If your OS isn't starting up and you want to reinstall without formating you can do that. Just put the CD in and go through the setup and when you get to the part where it asks you if you what type of format you want to use, just select the no change option. Or you can use a bootable Disk such as Knoppix or Bart's PE. I think you'll be fine :]

If you get outbid on the item that you want, another one just like it will be for sale at the same time or will show up eventually.    Do not get caught up in the bidding fever.  You'll overpay for the item and then you will not enjoy it.|`|7h5zhoJqaa	You have to wait until the last minute - more specifically the last 15 - 30 seconds to bid and win a lot of the time.  It's called bid sniping, and if you're bidding on anything popular, it's the only way to win without bidding over value.|`|5e0755e06d5f4f1b24b497cc9427c910aa	Honestly, there's no secret.  Whoever is willing to pay the most for an item gets it.  I scored a sweet pair of Fluevogs for $36 because no one else bid higher.  Usually Fluevogs would sell for at least $75.    For the last 6 months I've been trying to buy a rare CD, but I'm only willing to pay $20 for it.  I got outbid the last 5 or 6 times I saw one for sale.  Then suddenly, today I win it for $12.  You just never can tell.|`|afe3befb8efa10ebc6e97345909c2bdeaa	Bid Snipe, wait until the last 15 to 10 seconds (last 5 seconds if you're REALLY fast) place the absolute highest you'll pay for the item and bid.  Will usually work on most items.  But on rare items many other people will do this to.  SO when it comes to rare items it all depends on how much you're truly willing to spend...

HEfXwR7faa	Because Silverligt uses a proprietary, non open standards plugin, and flex (air and flash) use as3 and flash, which, even though they require a plugin, are generally accepted as a standard and most people already have it installed  Also, flex apps are cross system compatible, and don't thumb their noses at non-windows operating systems the way SL does. if you want your content to be instantly viewable by the vast majority of internet users it is really the best option.  Silverlight has a few advantages, but they are a drop in the bucket compared to annoying your users to the point they never see content.|`|awJvX8iHaa	because u cant use silverlight in Linux or mac PCs ( Silverlight 2 is ok with Mac. )    but Flex is a platform independent like flash players.  and Adobe relesed Linux Runtime Engine for that.

It is free for anyone who has iMovie'08 and is much better to use. It is third party plug in compatible, has a better interface and has HD capability. I hated iMovie until I discovered iMovie6HD. It's so much better.
AA11794023	I have seen and resolved problems like these numerous times before.  Unfortunately, there is no simple answer for you.  What follows is what I would look at in order of probability and cost.    The green light on the power supply will only detect the existance of electrical current.  That is, it doesnt care if there are 10V or 1000V coming into it.  If there is more current than 0, the light will be on.  The green light only tells us that there is signal and that the connection to power is complete.    1.  Check all cables to ensure nothing is frayed and/or broken.  This is not very likely, but replacing a $10 cable is far better than replacing a perfectly fine power supply.    2.  Connect the power cable to a different outlet and/or surge protector to be sure that the problem is not with the computer itself.  I have seen this happen only once, but a faulty battery backup was to blame for a similar issue.  Again, this is just worth the time to check out.    3.  Open the case and check to make sure that all of the internal cables are solidly connected.  If your not sure how to do this, consult your PC's manual.  If this task seems intimidating... STOP.  Take the computer to a repair shop where they will have spare parts they can use for testing as well as diagnostic equipment like voltage testers.    4.  Try replacing the power supply.  It definitely sounds like the most probably culprit is a dead PSU.  Or, at least, a power supply that is unable to output enough electricity to start the computer.  Computer's require the most electricity at startup because all of the components are engaged during the Power On Self Test (POST).    5.  POST will test your motherboard, processor, video card, etc. and will emit a series of beeps (sounding somewhat like morse code) to indicate what is wrong.  You can check your owner's manual for an explanation of the beep codes as some motherboards dont follow the standard.  Since you have not described any beep codes, I do not believe this problem is with your motherboard.    NOTE:  If the damage was caused by a power surge, it is very possible that replacing the power supply will uncover other damage.  Hard drives in particular are prone to surge damage, especially if they were not installed properly with all of their screws (which help ground them.)|`|AA11259815	Even without the hard drive, your computer should start up.    I've been through the exact situation as you. I disassembled the computer and tried to solve the problem myself. The problem I found was the power supply. Im not surprised to hear you say something about a power surge. I think what will help you is to disconnect your hard drive (unplug it from the motherboard and the power) then turn on you computer. If the computer starts up and you see something on your monitor, plug the hard drive back in and you'll be good to go. For some reason and I dont know why, this helped me. Which is why I think its the power supply. So if you unplug your hard drive, it wouldnt require as much energy to get everything started up. I think this advice will help, give it a try. Disconnect the power cord and disconnect the hard drive, see if that gets you anywhere. Oh you can also plug the hard drive in another power outlet. They're marked with a "P". If P6 is supplying power to the HD, try P5 for example.|`|c35e74e150d6db99ed6f90583b6184a6aa	If you have a voltmeter try measure the voltage dc, black & red should have 5volts and black & yellow should be at least 12volts. If ok then isolate the problem one by one start from drives. good luck|`|qHby1JYIaa	Question 1... Does the computer beep at any time after you hit that power button to turn it on?  If it doesn't beep at all... its your motherboard.  Just because you have a green light on the motherboard does not guarantee it is working properly, it just guarantees that the green light is getting power.  A power surge is most likely to blow your motherboard... and if the motherboard is not working, it will not run the pieces connected to it, which is probably why you do not hear the hard drive.  If the computer does beep... it is one most likely not the motherboard and is one of the items connected to it.|`|AA11673696	1. r u getting RAM beep (single beep)  after switching the computer???  If no.... remove >> clean the ram and slot &  place the RAM....      2. if you have additional RAM use this..|`|8Js8GyACaa	I don't know that the power light on the front is a good indication of power levels.  Usually, when you start a PC, it performs a POST (power on self test) and if this passes, the computer beeps.  Does it usually beep?  If it used to, but now now, my guess is that the computer can't complete a POST.      If that is the case, you might need to test the power supply with a voltmeter.  If it's putting out enough power, try booting from floppy or CD and running PC utilities to test each component (ie MemTest86 for RAM) .|`|QxERY26Laa	I do not think it is your power supply although you had power issues with your outlet.  I think it very well could be a motherboard issue.  Just take your PC case apart and you can feel if the hard drive is running or not.  Also, the computer should beep on startup usually if it goes through post.  I doubt any damage was done to the hard drive itself.  Good luck.

WQ0DzpByaa	the first C++ compiler was written in C  It couldn't have been written in C++ since there was no way to compile it yet.  The first compiler was written in IBM assembly language.  The first assembler was written in machine code.
JuoHnUfOaa	Well, yes, the internet is full (FULL) of examples and tutorials.  All you need to do is google it.  And yes, I'm pretty sure C++ is in Xcode, though you needn't be a registered developer to write the code and use XCode.  In fact, Apple uses for some of their products, such as the iPhone, Objective C, no C++.  It is a little like C++ and Java...but the syntax is pretty different...well really pretty different.  Anyway, I can't make any definitive approvals of C++, but I think Java is very easy for beginners, and there are a lot of online resourcces.  C is also a great language to learn.  It is the basis of many current languages, like C++, C , Objective C, and Java.  It is also used in many applications.  Knowledge of C is very useful, but is a bit trickier than Java due to poor String handling.  Anyway, if you want C the definitive book is the K&R book.  Almost anybody you ask will say K&R  (sometimes called Ritchie) is what you need for learning C.    So that is my little spiel on learning languages.  I haven't done a lot with C++, but found some resources via google to help me get through a HW in it once.  The internet is full of useful data, get used to harnassing its power.

r4qL79cLaa	dreamweaver is to the website you are thinking of, like a spatula is to spaghetti and meatballs.    or better yet, dreamweaver is to your site, like the pen is to the writer of a good book!      ---  having that software doesn't mean you can do that...it will help you, but you need more (way more) than dreamweaver to accomplish that.    you will need (for example as there are different choices available out there):  -php programming skills  -mysql programming skills  -html, css, and javascript programming skills  -a web hosting service that gives you php, mysql database and web space to accommodate your site content    ---if you have all of that, you can build your site, with just the use of a notepad on your computer...  but dreamweaver will simply make coding a bit easier for you.    ---  good luck.  PS  advice...  instead of having an overall picture of your site...  put every page (every use case scenario) on a sheet of paper...  then start looking into what works and what doesn't...and then you can start to see what functionality you will need...and then (finally) you can start to put together plan to code this thing.    ---  suggestion...  why reinvent the wheel?  Use Joomla (joomla.org) to create your website...in a matter of days...that will do all that you described...and MORE...totally, free, secure, tested and freely and openly supported by millions around the world.  all you would need is a domain name and a web hosting service (i.e. godaddy.com or whatever)|`|GMtoiRRmaa	if you want a secure place for ppl to register. you will need a database. and dreamweaver doesn't do that for you. plus beware of letting users upload stuff to your site. you only get a certain amount of space    and its not easy to program. dreamweaver wont accomplish all of it. you have to study and learn|`|elgVgRCRaa	Dreamweaver is merely a tool not a solution. It will allow you to do the job but you will need to learn coding and web design. You will need to learn PHP/CSS/MySQL/HTML minimum to pull this off. MySQL will be the database to hold the loops and PHP will be the code that calls to the database and renders the page into HTML. The design will be done with CSS. If you don't know web design then you have your work cut out for you. No program will just create what you want with a few clicks. This is what is called a dynamic website. Also think about legality. The music must be legally licensed for use on the site, and able to be downloaded.    [EDIT]  You can use Dreamweaver but will need to use code view to write the PHP, JavaScript, SQL etc... You can learn this but it will take time. Use Fireworks for web images not Photoshop.     You will need:  Dreamweaver  Fireworks  Linux web server with MySQL and PHP support|`|b2dba061b22a95a28afaab30f9d7b49daa	This is an advanced type of website. One that would require a thorough knowledge of code. Particularly PHP and JavaScript. You can create any kind of website in DreamWeaver, but it helps to have a strong foundation in design code, core DOM code and especially PHP for online account management.|`|854662b4b6098e523f95f5d734db611eaa	Dreamweaver allows amateurs to design static sites.  Nothing more.  Your site requires some interactivity, database, registration, uploads and downloads.  You can try with DW, but you will be here six times a day to ask "how can I..." and get no reply.  You can certainly START with DW (to do the mockup), but then, throw away DW and edit the code by hand.  You need:  Photoshop for pictures,  Notepad++ to edit your code,  Knowledge of, at least: HTML, javascript, Php, mySQL, (AJAX) if you are on LAMP server, much more if you are on a window server.  You can try some free scripts, or some webmanagement like Miva, joomla or ruby-on-rails, but it will take you longer to learn how to use them than to learn how to code!

Cable companies may be forced to disclose information about you if you make contact with a site fishing to catch downloaders and they decide to press charges.  However, there is a different question: how can i avoid going to a site or file sharing user that's trying to catch people downloading pirate software?  If you are using torrent sites to download something then use well known torrent sites with commenting capabilities: www.mininova.org, www.torrentz.com, www.piratebay.org  Make sure to read ratings/comments about each download so that you download anything that's been downloaded by many and they commented as "it worked" , "thanks ! this is working great" etc. This is good practice for downloading something secure also.    Now the biggest kicker   Download the following software: Peer Guardian 2  http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/  This software is awesome for security because it won't let your computer connect to sites and ip addresses belonging to government agencies, big companies, organizations, universites, blacklisted sites, etc. This way if the source of your download is potential trapper the program won't let you trapped. Incidentally this is good for your computer security as well.  This software works fine by itself as well as along with a bittorrent client like Vuze.    So in summary, all this will minimize the chance of getting caught but like a i said, no guarantees, understand the risks involved and don't do it.

HEfXwR7faa	if you are trying to connect to a remote server with a program such as sqlYog, you need to allow your ip access to the database.    you need to add your ip into the allowed hosts on your server (I'm assuming plesk or cpanel. if you created the db, it's in there)      A quick and dirty way is to do it is to add % into the allowed hosts. this will let ANY ip connect, but if you are going to run a production server, it's best to remove the % after you do your changes, since it will probably be accessing via localhost    Correct. Either the user or password was changed if you are seeing that on the website (especially if it the user mentioned is xxxxx@localhost)

hHC2oCqDaa	If you have to get into the registry, that is an area that experienced users should only be editing.    My suggestion would be to do the following to access your c: drive under another path.    1.  Go into Control panel  2.  Then into Administrative Tools   3.  Then into Computer Management  4.  In the directory tree under Storage go into Disk management  5.  In the top box on the right you will see all drives with info.       In the bottom box on the right you will see drive letter and a blue strip going across, which shows the amount of space on that drive.  6.  Right click in that box and choose "Change Drive Letter and Path.  7.  Change it to a drive that is not already being used (like say drive          S:), I doubt you have drives all the way up to S.  8.  once drive c: has been changed to drive s:, you should then be able to go into computer and Hard disk drive will show as S: drive.  9.  Try to get into it now  10.  If it still will not let you in.  11.  Do a System restore from a date that backup up before you started having this problem.  12. Or do a back up of all your data files not a system backup, then reinstall Windows.  Make sure you only backup important files you do not want lost.  If  there is a virus you do not want it backed up then installed when you reinstall windows and restore your backed up files.  Usually in back up you specify which files you want backup up (ie quicken files, media, pictures etc...).  13.  If you can afford to lose all data, because you have your important files on external drives then reinstall without doing a back up and you will have a fresh install of windows and rid of any virus,worm, or horse you may have gotten.    HOpe this helps.|`|ebuxHnScaa	Right click on your recycle bin. Hit properties. Turn off the recycle bin for drive C. Reboot. Then turn it back on.

Ti consiglio di scaricare Everest,  un freeware, piccolo e leggero, con quello oltre alla T puoi monitorare anche l'uso della RAM e della CPU (ma questo lo puoi fare anche dal task manager), e puoi stampare report molto precisi sul tuo pc.   Se ti serve monitorare la T continuamente, puoi tenerlo sempre aperto, non sfrutta molta RAM e quindi non  un peso per il pc, anche se utilizzi programmi molto severi.

0536d50a6fc40dc1eb09655509ccc8a6aa	Essa resposta  complexa e estava discutindo justamente isso com um amigo ontem.    Tudo come?ou no no incio da dcada de 80 quando a IBM estava para lancar o seu computdador pessoal (PC) e precisava de um sistema operacional. Bill Gates e Paul Allen se apresentaram para oferecer uma solu??o e compraram o MS-DOS de um cara e ofereceram a IBM. A IBM aceitou e pronto, o PC foi lan?ado com o sistema da MS. Em 1984 a Apple surgiu com seu computador pessoal, j com interface grfica, mas como era caro, a ado??o foi pouca. A IBM abriu a arquitetura do PC para qualquer fabricante (HP, Compaq, Dell, Toshiba etc) mont-los, assim o pre?o diminuiu mais ainda e a ado??o foi maior. Nessa poca existiam dois sistemas DOS o da MS (ms-dos) e o PC-DOS (de outro fabricante). N?o sei quem era  melhor, mas havia uma pequena concocorrncia na poca.  Tambm surgiram os primeiros editores de texto para DOS: Wordstar, Carta Certa etc. Vendo que estava ficando para trs na tecnologia, a MS lan?a o Windows no come?o da dcada de 90/final da de 80. ?Misteriosamente? o windows n?o rodava em cima do PC-DOS, o que levou esse sistema a extin??o, deixando o mercado s para o MS-DOS.  As primeiras vers?es do windows copiavam muito a interface do MAC e ofereciam menos recursos que o mesmo. Mas foram adotados assim mesmo.  Como na poca os computadores pessoais se resumiam ao PC e ao Mac, mas esse ltimo muito mais caro, as pessoas optaram pelo PC. Como o sistema operacional grfico que existia era s Windows ent?o ele foi se tornando padr?o.  O Windows 95 trouxe o internet explorer para dentro do sistema, o que acarretou o declnio do navegador netscape, melhor e mais seguro, mas condenado a morte pela inrcia dos usurios em baix-lo e us-lo.    O Linux come?ou a ficar mais popular no meio da dcada de 90, mais sua ado??o  lenta devido a inrcia dos usurios e gerentes de TI em adot-lo.  Hoje ele est bem mais fcil de ser instalado e usado e pode ser uma excelente alternativa a MS.    Emfim, o acumulo de riquesas foi resultado de estar no lugar certo na hora certa e preparado para isso. e n?o pela qualidade dos produtos. Existem coisas muito melhores no mercado, mas ningum quer migrar, infelizmente, pois muitas boas empresas fecham as portas.    Acrescente a isso tticas monopolistas que fecharam o mercado para outras empresas de informtica e a insistncia dos usurios em continuar usando seus produtos e n?o migrar para algo melhor. Todo mundo deixa de comprar uma marca de tv/dvd/carro/microondas se ela n?o funciona, mas isso n?o se aplica na informtica. E ningum gosta de monoplios (algum aqui tem saudades do monoplio das telecomunica??es? Quando uma linha telef?nica levava anos para ser instalada e custava uma fortuna?), mas fecha os olhos para isso.    Se voc olhar bem a histria, a MS n?o fez nada de revolucionrio para o mundo da informtica.    Falaram que os produtos da MS s?o bons, eu questiono isso. Alguns produtos s?o bons como o pacote office, outro s?o muito ruins. Na minha empresa quando um HD do windows xp se danifica de alguma forma, outro computador com o xp n?o reconhece o hd, mas um linux, sim.|`|270b1a2d66f88fa0b9cb5392a562cc01aa	Na verdade ele s fez "melhorar" algo que j exisita.

AA11794023	Ideally, 2GB is recommended for Windows Vista.  However, this is only a recommendation.  If you are happy with the way your laptop performs than there is no real value in upgrading.    Always remember one thing when thinking about purchasing a new computer or upgrading an existing one:  An upgrade only has value if the new machine will do what YOU want it to do, when you want to do it.  Upgrading a machine which currently meets all of your needs would be a waste of money.  You would be better served by saving that money and waiting for computer prices to drop.  I expect that manufacturers will begin offering big discounts and sales as the economy slows down.    I do not recommend upgrading a laptop that currently meets your needs.    To answer your other questions:  -RAM is a very reliable piece of equipment in general.  It uses "solid state" components with no moving parts and is typically tested before it is packaged.  -For your uses, the cheapest RAM available would be fine.  I do not think you would see much benefit from the "performance" RAM that is out there given that you do not game or do anything that is all that intense.    As a general tip:  Ask your warranty provider for a list of approved repair shops in your area.  If you really want to upgrade the RAM, there is likely an approved shop near you which can do the job without voiding your warranty.  Here in the United States, I am certified to do this type of work for HP, Dell, Asus, and Apple.  For the best results, ask the shop if they are ceritifed to repair servers as well.  If they say yes, the technicians would have to achieve a higher level of certification and are likely much more capable.|`|eTLG23N4aa	If you're happy with the performance of your computer and are not having any problems then don't worry about adding more memory.|`|X9vsoxB2aa	1 gig is fine for everyday tasks. 2gigs is preferable, but "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" basically. Vista needs a minimum of 512 kb of ram to boot to the desktop. You can probably open at most 1 or 2 programs with 512. But since you have a gig, you should be fine. Only upgrade if you want to. It is not necessary|`|rPxIvmzuaa	You can buy 2GB of RAM for just 40$. But it also differs on the Brand.|`|YnWrmVd1aa	My PC started with only 1GB of memory and I use Vista.  After upgrading to the max amount of memory that my computer allows it made no difference whatsoever.  I wouldn't worry about it unless you really notice significant problems.

11192d2ce10583e471269dd6bf731502aa	GIS data acquisition and conversion are costly. GIS data transfer is 60% to 70% of total GIS system costs. GIS data acquisition is an ongoing task. After initial data gathering for a GIS system, Information must be continuously added and updated. It is important to reduce data acquisition and conversion costs. It is here that GPS shines.  GPS can automate and speed GIS data processing at a lower cost compared with other methods. Several studies have shown GPS data gathering can reduce GIS data collection costs by 50% or more. For example, the City of Ontario compared a fire hydrant inventory by GPS and conventional methods. GPS cost $515 and 41 man-hours for a 942 fire hydrant inventory.  The same inventory by conventional methods would have cost $4,575 and have taken two to four months. In addition, GPS data offers both spatial and tabular information. Digitizing can be labor intensive and subject to positional error. Scanning offers speed but lost detail and editing are disadvantages. Remote sensing and photogrammetry, unless high-resolution imagery is possible, may not meet GIS spatial detail requirements. GPS positions are collected in a digital form in the field. Spatial and tabular data are collected simultaneously.    ======================================...        *  Accuracy to 5m        * You can travel faster and with great confidence in poor conditions.        * It can fix your position when you are lost or have no reference features.        * Excellent tool for planning or recording trips.        * Great for instructors since they can let students lead in poor conditions, using traditional methods, with out fear of becoming hopelessly lost.        * Can give you travel speed and ETA at a waypoint.|`|1ac7b06484f4a955e1c07b5816b369e8aa	you don't get lost is a good thing but its just more fun sometimes to get lost like discovering new things is kind of ruined if u always know exactly where u are.  also is gps always accurate?  im sure it could fail u sometimes and get you off track.|`|74016a8df84856c95f80dd30be98ef75aa	Good:  It can tell you where you are.

Advantages:    1) GPS units on the market today can pinpoint your position, as a latitude and longitude, to within eight or ten feet, under ideal conditions.  2) There is no need for anything other than the satellite signals--you don't need to be oriented in a particular direction etc.  3) Works day or night  4) Can save "waypoints" (position coordinates), so that you can come back to a spot you've been to    Disadvantages:  1) The latitude and longitude alone may not be of much use without map information  2) If there are trees overhead, tall buildings around, or other objects which keep the GPS unit from "seeing" the satellites, it may not be able to tell you your location  3) For the same reason, doesn't work indoors, in tunnels, etc  4) Doesn't give direction information, except indirectly. If you start walking, it will tell you the direction you're headed in    GPS units are pretty much indispensable wherever there are no other visual clues to location--in a boat on the ocean, in undeveloped areas with no roads, etc, and also at night.

I go to bed too late most evenings since I've gotten involved with this.      I've decided that most of the questions and answers are pretty silly and trite, as you said too, and  I found for myself that I spend most of my time looking for the interesting questions.  I guess that's the thrill of it, finding the needles in the haystack, interesting thinkers who are out there if we can only find them. So, I try to limit my time, like if I haven't found a worthwhile question in the last 10 minutes, it's time to quit.  I'm still developing a strategy to get myself under control on this.

When there are multiple rebates available for the same product, the retailer will often accept a copy of the purchase and product information when you have sent the originals to the manufacturer. For the specific rules of the promotions, you should refer to the terms and conditions on each rebate form as they can be different. Please note: Each submission may need to be mailed in a separate envelope to a different address. Always, make copies of everything before you mail the submissions.

7ovijMVqaa	Hi Colin H     VoodooDan here from HP. While both of these systems are high-performance and state-of the-art, if the primary activity you will be using your rig for is gaming, I would suggest the HP Firebird. However, if youre looking to for a more casual gaming experience versus something more hardcore, using touch can be a lot of fun.    Firebirds standard offerings make it perfect for gaming. For example the systems  quad-core Intel Core 2 processors, 4GB of DDR2-800 memory, and dual Nvidia Geforce 9800S video cards with 1GB of memory makes Firebird the full package.    The Firebird is also a great option from an energy saving perspective. the new system uses compact, power-sipping components usually found in notebook PCs, providing a reduced footprint and maximum energy usage.    And with your budget, you are able to pick up the Firebird 802 with a little cash to spare.    Let me know if you have any other Firebird questions. Im happy to help.    You can also check out this Firebird review: http://tinyurl.com/b6t9q3    -VoodooDan

I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but given how badly you've described the problem I don't think you're competent to do a CPU replacement. Your computer has failed to POST, which is the most common computer hardware problem there is, and you think the problem has something to do with the display.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	It probably is not the processor or the motherboard.  Since this is an AM2+ platform board, it looks like if fully supports your new processor.    I would do a couple of things.  First of all, I am sure you used heatsink paste or thermal paste on processor, right?  Have you made absolutely sure that the cpu heatsink/fan assembly is correctly installed?    Check and make sure your memory modules are firmly seated and that nothing became loose during the changeover process.  Likewise, recheck all your power connectors.    On this kind of board, it is possible on the power supply to have a 20 pin connector separate from a four pin 12 volt connector.  That four pin 12 volt connector CAN be inserted incorrectly (despite the fact supposedly it cannot) - I have done it, so I know!  Make sure that the 20 pin connector snaps firmly into the plastic clip and that the separate 4 pin 12 volt connector likewise snaps correctly into the plug.  Most likely you have a separate 12 volet 4 pin connector which supplies the cpu with power - double check that one too and make sure you have not somehow reversed it or that you have not snapped it firmly into the plug.  Any of these connector errors can result in a supposedly dead cpu.  It won't harm the processor or board if you have inserted the plugs incorrectly - it just won't turn on.    I would try one other thing, after firmly checking the above and ensuring everything is correct.  Disable SLI and run a single video card to begin with in the first X16 slot only.  If this results in a boot up, you know something is going on with the SLI(at least, one of the cards).|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	Maybe your motherboard doent support the new chip.

A0uqbBTiaa	VOIP = Voice Over Internet Protocol    VOIP is used in local area networks as well as over the internet to transmit voice data for telephone calls.  It uses IP networks to create a bridge between VOIP devices, such as phones and switches, or between the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and a VOIP device.    Businesses often use VOIP to deliver telephone service from a central switching location to various locations within their network.  This allows them to centralize their telecom services without spending a lot of money updating or adding infrastructure and equipment, as it allows use of existing network technologies and infrastructure.    Many home users have adopted VOIP technology to replace traditional land-line phones.  The service works over the users broadband internet connection to connect to the PSTN, allowing telephone calls to any phone connected to the PSTN.  This eliminates the expense of using the PSTN for voice traffic over long distances, which is more expensive than transmitting data traffic over the internet.    VOIP is increasingly being used for long haul transmission of PSTN to PSTN traffic as well, due to the cost savings associated with the protocol.    The most notable difference between VOIP technology and traditional voice communications is the use of digital signals rather than analog signals.  Using a digital signal, the audio can be compressed before transmission, lowering the amount of bandwidth required, and thereby increasing the amount of traffic that can be transmitted over the available bandwidth.    Another benefit to VOIP technology is flexibility.  A company or individual can move their VOIP technology anywhere in the world and still use it as long as they can obtain enough internet bandwidth.|`|0dEG6Y4daa	V.O.I.P.  Voice over Internet.

Type the IP address of the router into your web browser and log in. Navigate to the Wireless security area, the WPA password is usually there.    To find you router's IP address, press (on the keyboard) (Windows key + R), type 'cmd' then press enter. on the black screen that comes up, type 'ipconfig'. Look for default gateway, and thats your router's IP address. Type that number into your browser. 10.1.1.1 OR 192.168.1.1 are common ones.    To log into the router, for most modems the username is 'admin' and the password is also 'admin' by default. Check your usermanual, or search you router's brand on the internet.    Another way to find the WPA (or WEP) wireless network key is with WirelessKeyView:  http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_ke...

Usually to do this you connect to the router using an ethernet cable, open up a web browser (such as firefox or internet explorer) and in the address bar type 192.168.1.1. (This does not work for all routers) Some routers may have a default ip of something like 10.0.0.1. Check your routers manual or google your router to find the default ip. You may also be prompted for a password. The default username and password are usually username: admin and password: admin.) You should now have the setup screen for your router. Go to the "wireless" tab and you should see your WEP key, however it may be encrypted. If it is just change the WEP key to whatever you want.     Hopefully it helped.

Your best solution is taking it to a certified Mac repair shop; Or reformatting clean the hard drive and reinstalling the OS and everything again.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	A couple suggestions, try your password about 5 times, any password. If you set your Mac up correctly then it will give you the "hint" you entered when you set the computer up to remember your password.

You will then be able to access the accounts section in your system preferences and reset your password. Please write it down. You need it to update your software, install programs etc. The password is case sensitive so make sure your caps key is not locked down.  I am assuming the Mac is really yours and you haven't picked one up at a "fire" sale somewhere.

A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your virus scanner database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    And as a bonus, your computer will be cleaner and probably a bit zippier ( all that for free ! )

AA11853764	A servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed via a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by Web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.     The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes for writing servlets. All servlets must implement the Servlet interface, which defines life-cycle methods.     When implementing a generic service, you can use or extend the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet class provides methods, such as doGet and doPost, for handling HTTP-specific services.          An applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image is included in a page. When you use a Java technology-enabled browser to view a page that contains an applet, the applet's code is transferred to your system and executed by the browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM). For information and examples on how to include an applet in an HTML page, refer to this description of the  tag.     An applet is a software component that runs in the context of another program, for example a web browser. An applet usually performs a very narrow function that has no independent use. Hence, it is an application -let. The term was introduced in AppleScript in 1993. An applet is distinguished from "subroutine" by several features. First, it executes only on the "client" platform environment of a system, as contrasted from "servlet." As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser). Also, in contrast with a subroutine, certain capabilities are restricted by the container. An applet is written in a language that is different from the scripting or HTML language which invokes it. The applet is written in a compiled language, while the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence, the greater performance or functionality of the applet. Unlike a "subroutine," a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.|`|AA11566069	Applet - client side  Servlet - server side|`|AA11224952	http://www.j-nine.com/pubs/applet2servle...|`|AA10557030	That's funny... I thought we were using Applets more (wow.. call me the newbie), but yer   Applet- Client (browser) side  Servlet- Server side  Server side programming is most of the time more powerful (PHP VbScript, MySQL) so I bet that's were the Servlet being more peopular comes from.

If I were you I would not delete or save anything right now so that the data won't be overwritten on what is now considered "empty" hard disk space.    I know it's possible because I used to know a person who worked for a company who retrieved data like that for crime solving purposes.|`|AA10991551	haha nope. too bad...|`|4a7ad3fbf4830386270380651d863723aa	Normally, no. But there are some software packages that will allow you to do so. Usually costing quite a bit of money.    But you can find some around online. One I used is GetDataBack for NTFS (may need the one for FAT depending on your filesystem) And it's at runtime.org.    And any undelete software should do it.... However, I would recommend not using Windows much and attempting connecting the HD to another computer as once it's overwritten, it's lost forever.  Hope it helps :)

The control unit (CU), which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.       arithmetic logic unit, the part of a computer that performs all arithmetic computations, such as addition and multiplication, and all comparison operations. The ALU is one component of the CPU (central processing unit).     control unit, it is a typical component of the CPU that implements the microprocessor instruction set. It extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, and sends the necessary signals to the ALU to perform the operation needed. Control Units are either hardwired (instruction register is hardwired to rest of the microprocessor) or micro-programmed.      u can also check in the following site  http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/neufeld/cour...  http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~csonline/Machi...

4c4eb347948659933bc30a51fd1f7ff2aa	Yes, you should backup your important files from time to time. In case you don't do it, your computer may suffer of any harm (like a virus or a power loss) and you may lose some data, which may be important!|`|1222c68038a355846cdd27adad692334aa	The answer to this question resides in how important your data is to you.      Lets say tommorow your computer is stolen and all your computers data was lost.  Insurance pays for a new computer, so you will have a new one of those, but your data is now all lost, would you be upset about it?      If yes, then you should backup your data, if not, then I woulnd't worry about it.|`|AA10711724	ya back up is always preffered  if u have any confidential files and important files in your system|`|AA12396944	I can give you a rather expensive object lesson in the need to do backups.  Normally I usually do backups, but I'd neglected them for the last several months, mine own stupid fault.    Then, my 40GB harddrive blew, with months worth of emails & business data.  So, I sent the drive out for recovery.  They did get all the data back, which may not always work depending on how badly the drive failed.  Price: $1125 + shipping.  Ouch.  Note that if your data was deleted or damaged by a virus or system problem, it may not be recoverable at all, since it's no longer on the drive.  In my case, the controller board for the drive had blown, but at least all the information on the drive itself was intact.    Back up everything that's important.  Some people back up the entire drive, the OS, all installed software, everything.  IMO, that's overkill; you can always reinstall all the software and the OS.  In fact, periodically, I reformat and do just that.  However, taking an image of the entire drive will allow you to recover relatively quickly if you have a complete failure.  Of course, for a large drive, you need *another* large drive to back it up onto, or lots of DVDs.|`|51e7775d08bb88f656838c16738b1e53aa	Too much sad above.  well it's up to u.  If u are sure in ur PC and security u can forget about it.  but in think that it's necessary.  Normally, HDD should have 3 partitions.  1 for Programm Files  2 for OS  3 for back up.  Besides backup allows  1. to restore to different hardware and recover from any unforeseen event.   2. easily  change Os (upgrade PC).   3. and many other details.|`|AA12181805	This ensures that if you should get a virus or computer crashes for any reason, that you have a copy of your files that can be reloaded on the computer.  You should do a backup up at least once a week.  Doesn't take long to accumulate information.|`|cce1b6a6754c9871427f7a5018ca6516aa	really, the only people who need to back up there files are people who use there computer for anything more than just surfing the web. the reason people back up there files is so that if you hard drive dies you don't lose valuable data, so if you run a business with your computer you should have a backup, if you just ask questions on yahoo it would not be worth your time|`|AA10912783	Just in case there is a virus on your computer, and you have to reset your operating system. When you reset your operating system, they will delete all of your files and all of your important documents will be gone.|`|AA10346371	It is not really necessary to backup your entire hard drive. The operating system (usually windows) can be reinstalled along with the programs  Your data files are another story.  Any of your data files you feel are important, you definitely need to backup.  Anything can happen with a computer, hard drive failure, power surges, lightning strikes, etc.  I personally have only about a 50% success rate of recovering data from a failed hard drive. It's not if your hard drive will fail, but when.  Things i consider precious are my MP3s, digital photos, word documents, Internet shortcuts, etc. I have a database that I have been working on for years that I would feel bad if I lost it.  All of these items I have backups of.  I also don't keep my backup in the same location as my computer.  What if something happened like the building burned down.

Before you buy anything, check out the specs for the games you plan to play the most, and see what cards they support.  ATI & nVidia are the two major types; many games support both, but they may support one better than the other.  Also, get recommendations from people as to how much RAM you need.

If running cable to your house exceeds that distance, they can't provide you DSL or you would end up with a really crappy connection.    Sometimes this can be resolved by using a different kind of DSL than the regular ADSL that SBC usually provides.  Its called IDSL or SDSL.  Contact Megapath Networks to see if you can qualify for it.

AA12396944	This does not require hiring a professional, it's a rather simple & straightforward program.     Raven put you on the right track, use the modulo (%) operator to break out the thousands from the hundreds, the hundreds from the tens, etc.  Define an array or map of strings with the words for each number up to twenty, then thirty, forty, fifty.. to ninety, then hundred, thousand.  Break the number apart, and get the appropriate words from the array & string them together.|`|0f8b9beb67cc831da486f11f7d76eda5aa	The easiest way, IMHO, is a lookup table.      First, you have to convert the input (a char string) into a number:    int EnteredNumber = atoi(Input);    Next, you have to convert that number into a char string.  Simply use the entered number as an index into a lookup table:    char *Output = NumberToSpelling[EnteredNumber];    (Naturally, you'll want to double-check your input so that your index will not be out of range of your table.)    Lastly, you print this to the screen:      printf("%s = %s", Input, Output);    The NumberToSpelling table would have to be pre-defined:    char *NumberToSpelling[3001] = {"Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", ...etc, "Two-thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine", "Three thousand"};    (Though, you can read it from a file at run time, should that suit your fancy.)    OK, so it's not pretty.  But it is straightforward....|`|e5d50333ac057556aec0494417f6a511aa	wel i could straight away type out da code bt it wouldn't be proper right. so i'll just giv u some guide lines. u can always mail me in for further info. the program will use the operation known as mod or in c++  % operator. this gives us the reemainder after division. so for example 1525%100=25. use this to separate out the digits to ones tens hundreds and thousands. you would also hav to use like this  ones=num%10  tens=((num%100)-(ones))/10  and so on(figure out the one for 1000es)    then just print them out apprpriately to print the number use the same function as it is same for ones hund's and thous. bt add hundres and thousand words to the end.  that should be it. mail me if u need anything else.|`|7554edb7a8d6a7de4dc97e56b35a38adaa	This will require lots of time and planning to accomplish.

This is due to more and more fake candidates (with fake experience and education) are coming up in the market.    If you are a fresher, dont lose heart.... Try to contact IBM like big companies.

AA11853764	In their most general meanings, the terms front end and back end refer to the initial and the end stages of a process flow. These terms acquire more special meanings in particular areas. The general idea is that the front-end is responsible for collecting input from the user, which can be in a variety of forms, and processing it in such a way that it conforms to a specification that the back-end can use. The connection of the front-end to the back-end is a kind of interface.    In software design, the front-end is the part of a software system that deals with the user, and the back-end is the part that processes the input from the front-end. The separation of software systems into "front ends" and "back ends" is a kind of abstraction that helps to keep different parts of the system separated.     Some common methods for interacting with computers can be conceptualized in terms of a "front-end" and "back-end". For example, a graphical file manager, such as Windows Explorer or the Nautilus file manager, can be thought of as a front-end to the computer's file system. At the OS level, the concept of a graphical user interface (GUI) can be thought of as a "front end" for the system (for general users), while the command line or "TUI" is sufficiently technical to be considered a "back-end." This often applies to software packages as well, which may have both graphical interfaces (front) as well as command-line scripts (back).|`|AA12103837	front end is the user interface  backend is to store the details/the place where data  manipulation takes place|`|AA12085647	In software design, the front-end is the part of a software system that deals with the user, and the back-end is the part that processes the input from the front-end.

So visitors   would be the number of individual computers that have connected, wheras page views are how many times that particular page has been sent to a visiting computer.|`|AA11935119	A visitor represents one person.     Page views represent the pages that the person views.     If your website has 10 visitors, and each visitor HITS 10 pages, you will see 100 page views.    I believe that the number of visitors is the significant statistic in rating your website's activity.   Once you establish the level of visitors and the number of actual sales that can be attributed to the website, you will have a simple ratio of the number of visitors need to yield real SALES.      Should that number be significant, you can then decide how much internet advertising you can budget to make your website help your business grow.    Certainly, it would be awesome if you could use Google Ads and other advertising programs to increase the number of visitors to yield higher profits.     This is the essence of the DOT COM BUST.   Product recognition is still an important issue, because closing deals and creating new repeat customers is the job of a SALESMAN, who is a person that speaks to people.|`|f50547b74d9a3f5f047b4c2edb7d17e4aa	I believe that page views is counting the page views, without regard for who the visitor is. So one visitor could have multiple page views. Visitors is counting the unique visitors, and therefore a visitor with multiple page views would only count as one visitor.
AA12396944	You didn't say what language?  In C or C++, you can use the standard library function quicksort().  You just need to create a custom sorting function that takes an entire row of the array and simply compares the last column.|`|e7afdce2f2a521650aa33e719069e0b4aa	This would vary greatly depending on the computer language involved.  Not sure where the 2d array comes in -- you provided 3 integers.  Speaking generally, if you use modulus on those numbers, you can pick off the last digit using Mod 10.  So assuming for example that the modulus operator is '%', then:    12703 % 10 = 3.      If your program created an array that was keyed by the number % 10, and then you sorted on that key, you'd have the solution.

You may try system administrator, programmer and like I said, most jobs that relate to the software side of computers.    You're also going to have to study a lot on you own, because computers are much more complex thatn one cand learn in 3 years.

Overall, for any job a positive attitude is the most basic requirement of success. I feel that if you give a try to any small technology company, you can achieve success and satisfaction which should be your primary goal.

AA11853764	Basic Rule of the OSI model    Each layer of the model can only talk to the one above it and below it  e.g. The Network layer can only pass information to the Transport layer above it and the Data Link layer below it.    Passing information from one layer to another is done in a standard way. This means that if company A has written some software for the Transport layer  and company B has written some software for the Network layer  then they are guaranteed to be able talk to each other.    Any layer does not care or need to know how the layers beneath it work. It will assume that the information it needs, is going to be presented in a standard way. This makes it much simpler to design the layer itself.|`|AA11666968	I think you mean "role" and not "rule"...|`|AA10540598	IEEE standard 802|`|AA11699406	Live and let live rule.    Do or die rule.

If you are using Windows XP or 2000, there is a feature called "Compressed Folders".   In case you're using Windows 2000, check this link out to enable it:  http://www.petri.co.il/enable_compressed...    The basic procedure is:  1. Right click the folder you want to password protect  2. Click Send To-> Compressed Folder  3. Double-click the compressed folder that has been created by the same name as the original, but with a different icon.  4. Click on File->Add a Password  Add the password and confirm.    Please note that the files will be accessible if you try immediately. After you try to extract the files, however, the password locking begins.     Disadvantages:  1. Folders and filenames remain visible.   2. Files protected this way cannot be viewed or run, but can be deleted.     Alternative is a 3rd party software. Most of these will work on any Windows OS Version. Both shareware(try before buy) and freeware are now available. Features vary, so please check them out for what you find convenient. Here's links to some of them:    Check this download search query for freeware results:  http://www.download.com/3120-2001_4-0-1-...

A comunica??o telef?nica atravs de VoIP apresenta grandes vantagens sobre a telefonia convencional, sendo que a principal delas tem sido a redu??o de despesas que proporciona, visto que a rede de dados (e consequentemente a VoIP) n?o est sujeita  mesma tarifa??o das liga??es telef?nicas convencionais, que  calculada em fun??o de distancias geodsicas e horrios de utiliza??o estabelecidos pelas Operadoras de Telefonia. Outra grande vantagem da VoIP em rela??o  telefonia convencional  que esta ltima est baseada em comuta??o de circuitos, que podem ou n?o estar sendo utilizados, enquanto a VoIP utiliza comuta??o por pacotes, o que a torna mais "inteligente" no aproveitamento dos recursos existentes (circuitos fsicos e largura de banda). Esta caracterstica (comuta??o por pacotes) tambm traz outra vantagem  VoIP, que  a capacidade dos pacotes de voz "buscarem" o melhor caminho entre dois pontos, tendo sempre mais de um caminho, ou rota, disponvel e, portanto, com maiores op??es de contingncia (caracterstica intrnseca das redes IP).    Outra forma de utiliza??o da telefonia VoIP  via ATAs (Analog Terminal Adapters). Os ATAs s?o aparelhos que podem ser conectados diretamente a um acesso banda larga (ADSL, Cabo, etc.) e a um aparelho telef?nico comum. Com o servi?o habilitado,  possvel ter um telefone em qualquer lugar do mundo funcionando 24 horas por dia, sem necessidade de computador e fones de ouvido.    Este servi?o permite realizar e tambm receber liga??es para nmeros telef?nicos tradicionais, pois possui um nmero telef?nico associado a ele.    O uso da VoIP n?o  novo, existem grandes empresas que j vm fazendo uso desse servi?o h muitos anos, mas somente agora com mais maturidade e se tornando mais acessvel a mdias e pequenas empresas que come?aram a consolidar o uso da tecnologia VoIP. A grande maioria das empresas que implantam a tecnologia de Voz sobre IP alcan?a a principal vantagem dessa tecnologia que  a redu??o com o custo de telefonia, muitas vezes chegando at em 70%. Mas ainda existe uma resistncia dos usurios que ainda temem pelo novo, e das operadoras de telefonias que temem pela abertura de um novo mercado. O que constatamos hoje  que a VoIP j  realidade e a cada dia ganha mais espa?o no ambiente das grandes corpora??es, com isso a tendncia  que a grande maioria das empresas migre para esse novo paradigma de comunica??o de voz.    Ainda n?o existe um consenso regulatrio sobre a VoIP no mundo. Hoje em dia no Brasil ainda n?o existe uma discuss?o sobre a regulamenta??o da VoIP, mas o aumento desta tecnologia nos leva a pensar que em breve teremos movimentos neste sentido.  O rg?o responsvel pela regulamenta??o de telefonia no Brasil  a Agencia Nacional de Telecomunica??es  ANATEL que  gerida pela Lei Geral de Telecomunica??es  LGT. A Legisla??o brasileira n?o enquadra a Voip como servi?o de telecomunica??es, e sim como servi?o de valor adicionado, quando utiliza parte da rede pblica de telecomunica??es. O servi?o VoIP  regido pelo Art. 61. da LGT. O VoIP  regido pelo Regulamento do SMC, Servi?o de Comunica??es Multimdia, que possibilita a oferta da capacidade de transmiss?o, emiss?o e recep??o de informa??es multimdia utilizando quaisquer meios (Art. 3o). E define informa??es multimdia como sinais de udio, vdeo, dados, voz e outros sons, imagens, textos e outras informa??es de quaisquer natureza . Ou seja: embora seja um servi?o que transporta a grandes distancias (tele) sons e voz (fonia), o VoIP n?o  telefonia. E para deixar isso claro, o Art. 66o do Regulamento estabelece que Na presta??o de SCM n?o  permitida a oferta de servi?o com caractersticas de Servi?o Telef?nico Fixo :  Veja tambm   http://www.rnp.br/noticias/imprensa/2004...|`|ecb005153df1a5f179e40d1bd2056fc0aa	Voz sobre IP ou VoIP  uma tecnologia que permite a digitaliza??o e codifica??o de voz e o empacotamento de dados IP para a transmiss?o em uma rede que utilize TCP/IP.

VoIP geralmente  tratada em algumas ocasi?es como sendo o mesmo que Telefonia IP embora sejam defini??es totalmente distintas. VoIP  a tecnologia ou tcnica de se transformar a voz no modo convencional em pacotes IP para ser transmitida por uma rede de dados, enquanto a Telefonia IP, que utiliza VoIP, traz consigo um conceito de servi?os agregados muito mais amplo, j que carrega outras aplica??es que n?o somente VoIP.    A telefonia IP permite a redu??o dos custos de telefonia das empresas, pois convergem servi?os de dados, voz, fax e vdeo, e tambm constri novas infra-estruturas para aplica??es avan?adas de e-commerce (ex., Call center Web). Os programas mais utilizados no Brasil s?o a ZipVox, o Skype, o VoxFone, o TelefoneBarato, o Tellfree, o Teleminas, o Google Talk e o Voipwebfone.

Even if your intentions are good, you shouldn't be asking for others' email addresses in a public forum.  There are too many nerdie script kiddies out there that would love to get active email addresses so they can spam it or send virus/trojans.  Furthermore, why are you so bent on giving out Gmail invites?    Gmail invites aren't hard to get these days...|`|AA11344952	they work together very well.|`|05b2f5c8ae174f252314c94193a2d719aa	It is not just phishing; it violates the ToS, which clearly states that    "upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation, except in those areas (such as shopping) that are designated for such purpose (please read our complete Spam Policy);"    Sure, Yahoo and Google are probably competitors (why else would Yahoo mail suddenly upgrade to 1Gb besides pressure from Google?). But it's obvious why they deleted your message.

5d4442ed831ecea0e43a66f4203d9fc9aa	A lot of it depends on your where clause itself, and not the indexes. Too many indexes on a table can slow down access anyway. Do you have a date in your query, or a partial string? Are you joining a lot of tables in your query (where you don't have foreign keys set up)? It seems odd that you are getting poor performance with so few rows.|`|34c14136141ab70b872925202d5e199caa	make use of explain statement with select statement  that should show you how the mysql searches for the data you have requested. it also shows you the indexes it is using for searching. By this you can decide which fields you can index.  a tip:something related to   the key buffer ratio should be less 1:1000 which confirms that the performance is good

In that sense, I believe my avatar is a declaration that I am at peace with myself, my life, my fate, which is a gift I would wish for anyone on the path to happiness. :)      I think overall the avatar system is fun, light-hearted, and I actually appreciate the somewhat entertaining way to express my more macabre reality. ;)    I mean, where else can you find such a *cute* way to visually express that I have lost my ever-lovin' mind than that pic showing me there holding my head after it's gone and rolled off? ;)    I also appreciate that it gives ALL users the chance to sort through what they value, how they perceive themselves, how they wish to appear vs how they DO actually appear...what they hope to see in the mirror vs reality...whether they like ALL their components...whether they like THEMSELVES...key factors brought to light by your excellent question--THANKS! :D

The CMM ranks software development organizations according to a hierarchy of five process maturity levels. Each level ranks the development environment according to its capability of producing quality software. A set of standards is associated with each of the five levels. The standards for level one describe the most immature, or chaotic, process, and the standards for level five describe the most mature, or quality, process. Currently an estimated 75% of software development organizations achieve only level 1 standards (source as of May 10, 1998).    Level 5 - Optimizing  Maturity level 5 focuses on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological improvements. Quantitative process-improvement objectives for the organization are established, continually revised to reflect changing business objectives, and used as criteria in managing process improvement. The effects of deployed process improvements are measured and evaluated against the quantitative process-improvement objectives. Both the defined processes and the organizations set of standard processes are targets of measurable improvement activities.|`|6adf3b8e07988bb94ace992c9a4d29f5aa	The Capability Maturity Model model is an organizational model that describes 5 evolutionary stages (levels) in which an organization manages its processes.     CMM describes 5 evolutionary stages in which an organization manages its processes. The thought behind the Capability Maturity Model, originally developed for software development, is that an organization should be able to absorb and carry its software applications. The model also provides specific steps and activities to get from one level to the next.     The 5 stages of the Capability Maturity Model are:     1. Initial (processes are ad-hoc, chaotic, or actually few processes are defined)  2. Repeatable (basic processes are established and there is a level of discipline to stick to these processes)  3. Defined (all processes are defined, documented, standardized and integrated into each other)  4. Managed (processes are measured by collecting detailed data on the processes and their quality)  5. Optimizing (continuous process improvement is adopted and in place by quantitative feedback and from piloting new ideas ands technologies)     The Capability Maturity Model is useful not only for software development, but also for describing evolutionary levels of organizations in general and in order to describe the level of Value Based Management that an organization has realized or wants to aim for.

This file format conforms to the Microsoft Windows Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) specification, which makes it convenient for sharing the file with law enforcement authorities and others that may need to view the video. AVI files (which typically end in the .avi extension) require a specific player that may be included with your Web browser    Audio Video Interleave. A computer file format for storing video. Files in this format can only be played using software able to recognize and decode the AVI format. This standard was developed by Microsoft    A QuickTime file (*.mov) functions as a multimedia container file that contains one or more tracks, each of which store a particular type of data, such as audio, video, effects, or text (for subtitles, for example). Each track in turn contains track media, either the digitally-encoded media stream (using a specific codec such as Cinepak, Sorenson codec, MP3, JPEG, DivX, or PNG) or a data reference to the media stored in another file or elsewhere on a network. It also has an "edit list" that indicates what parts of the media to use.    MPEG-4 Part 14 or *.mp4, is a file format (a so called container) specified as a part of the ISO/IEC MPEG-4 international standard.

AA11022617	NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI, pronounced net-booey, also known as NetBIOS Frame, or NBF) is an unrouted (non-routable) network- and transport-level data protocol most commonly used as one of the layers of Microsoft Windows networking. NetBIOS over NetBEUI is used by a number of network operating systems released in the 1990s, such as LAN Manager, LAN Server, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and Windows NT.    The protocol is commonly confused with NetBIOS itself; NetBIOS is best thought of as a set of services provided to applications, with NetBEUI being a protocol that implements those services. NetBEUI can be seen as implementing NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 LLC. Other protocols, such as NetBIOS-over-IPX/SPX and NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP (NBT), also implement the NetBIOS services over other protocol suites.    NetBEUI uses 802.2 type 1 mode to provide the NetBIOS name service and datagram service, and 802.2 type 2 mode to provide the NetBIOS session service (virtual circuit). NetBEUI makes wide use of broadcast messages, which accounts for its reputation as a chatty interface.    Sytek developed NetBIOS for IBM for the PC-Network program and was used by Microsoft for MS-NET in 1985. In 1987, Microsoft and Novell utilised it for their network operating systems LAN Manager and Netware.    Because NetBEUI is an unrouted protocol, It can only be used to communicate with devices on the same network segment or segments that are connected to that segment via bridges. This means that it is only well-suited for small to medium-sized networks; it must be encapsulated within another protocol in order to be of use in a wide area network.

In 1987, Microsoft and Novell utilised it for their network operating systems LAN Manager and Netware.    Because NetBEUI is an unrouted protocol, It can only be used to communicate with devices on the same network segment or segments that are connected to that segment via bridges. This means that it is only well-suited for small to medium-sized networks; it must be encapsulated within another protocol in order to be of use in a wide area network.    The use of NetBEUI has decreased quickly since the development of NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP.
