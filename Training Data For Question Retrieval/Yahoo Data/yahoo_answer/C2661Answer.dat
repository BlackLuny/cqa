IFiwmb3Haa	Not Normal.  Call your vet immediately.|`|GT6396BDaa	You need to take your dog to the vet as soon as possible.  Call them and let them know what is happening to your dog and that you are bringing them in.  Your dog is having a severe reaction to the heart worm medication and needs treatment.  They may give your dog prednisone, which is a steroid.  Most dogs will respond right away, but may need other treatment and observation at the vets.  Please get your dog to the vet.  Best of luck.  Hope I helped.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	NO, it's NOT normal.  Why are you online, asking a bunch of strangers?  You should be in your car taking the dog to the vet's office.|`|6cRj7pMSaa	NO!!! You need to get to the vet immediately!   The vet should have told you if any coughing occurs, you should bring your dog right back in.|`|TvDubaNxaa	No, unless your pet had a problem ingesting the medicine or is reacting to some other treatment. Call your vet, if i were you i'd go in soon , its better to be safe than sorry.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Coughing up blood is an instant "take the dog to the vet right now" situation.|`|sFDehMk5aa	Coughing up blood after heartworm treatment means that the dead worms have fragmented apart and gone into the lungs of your dog.  You need to get your dog to the NOW without delay!!!!!
pvH3oHRfaa	You could try poison, although it does mean getting rid of the mouse once dead, and if it crawls somewhere you can't get to, it means putting up with dead mouse stink...    You can get these things called ultrasonic pest repellers, which you plug into sockets. They let out a really high pitch noise that only rodents can here. They really don't like it and go away from it.    We had mice, and it totally freaked me out! they had found a packet of bird seed under the sink, and were helping themselves. We couldn't get one of the plug in things as we had a hamster. We laid traps, but like your friend, ours were smart; ate the food but didn't get trapped!     Basically we just made it unappealing for the mouse by putting away anything he could eat, putting everything in boxes etc, and he went away of his own accord. Or the neighbors cat ate him. One of the two!    But since you're in an apartment, and don't know what other peoples apartments are like food wise, I would try the ultrasonic thingy.     Hope that helps - sorry for the essay!|`|tkqGwbtHaa	get a glue trap|`|wX5xoAN8aa	Grab a shotgun.     But if you would like to take a more serious approach you could call one of those people that sprays those fumes that kills rodents.|`|8QatPQfRaa	Decon.    The poison thins the blood. When blood is thinner, volume decreases. The natural reaction is to drink fluids. The mouse will feel dehydrated and look for water. Mice typically do not nest near water. This is what makes Decon great. The mice will leave the nest (your home) in search for water and die while outside the home.|`|nT6dNIfBaa	well i have to tell u i am not a cat person at all but i live in the desert and after 27 years of dealing with snakes, scorpions, and mice i got a cat and i have never seen anything living in my house, or around my house, since (except for humans)...lol. but my cat stays outside it is only allowed in for 1 hour a day and the 1 hour he is in here he is looking for something to catch. it has now been 4 years and my cat has never damaged anything in my house. so my answer would be a cat is the best way to keep all living creatures away from ur house. good luck to u|`|dBWz9Lidaa	Get a HUMANE trap and release it out into the wild, the poor wee thing.|`|TIi5R0v0aa	Put just a TINY bit of cheese on the trap. I lived in an apartment about a year ago that got mice, and I caught eight mice in two days using traps. We eventually found a hole in the wall where they had eaten through from the absolutely disgusting neighboring apartment filled with trash and food and dog excrement.|`|W0MxpaxWaa	nawwwwww don't kill it!  have you seen stuart little, you should make friends with the furry little guy and you will all be happy together.    also this sounds like a valuable mouse of which should not be destroyed.|`|ieeq5jx8aa	DONT KILL THE MOUSE!!!!!!! get a humane mouse trap and but a tiny bit of food rite at the bac of it and after that releese it to the wild
AA12128656	electric fences are cruel, and often ineffective.  your fence should be higher, and the dog shouldn't be able to see through it. we have an 8 foot high stockade fence for the same reason.    this is fun for her, and she may want to continue it. in addition, dogs enjoy running their boundaries. rather than install new sod (which she'll rip up again, try instead to be proactive. you CAN have a pretty yard with dogs. once you install the new sprinkler pipe, (deeper) lay some silt paper on top and then cover it with crushed stone. (we like 1/2" stone for this- it won't get stuck in your shoes) this will make an attractive border path that the dog can run on. bonus, it will file her nails. we have our stone dogpath bordered by flagstone so that the crushed stone won't go into the yard. it's the only thing that we've found that works, that allows us to have a pretty landscaped yard, and a dog who can STILL run back and forth as he pleases.    please don't put a shock collar on her, the poor dog is only entertaining herself.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	You should get a higher fence, and nota see throgh one, one that is of metal, but not an electric fence.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	You could use corrective behavior techniques or put in a wood fence to see if that helps first before you try shock collars or electric fence.  That might help.|`|4EpXcNg4aa	Do not get an electric fence. That will only do more damage to your dog. What we did (we have to very energetic boxers) My husband built a chain link kennel in one corner of our back yard. You can buy them already built and assemble it but they are cheaper if you just but the material at a Lowe's or home depot and build it yourself. I think we spent close to $400 but it's a HUGE kennel and well worth it. We used to let them roam around our back yard but now we too have dirt spots and they started to dig under our wooden deck so we had to get them a huge kennel run. they have a lot of room, keeps them safe in one area. We have to huge dog houses in there for shelter as well. Good luck!|`|vPde97E2aa	MY dogs are NOT allowed such HORRIBLE behavior!!    MY dogs are safely PENNED & behind a PRIVACY FENCE & ON CONCRETE ***&*** IMMEDIATELY brought IN at the first sign of BULLCRAP like that!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	I suggest that you do more with your dog.  Go to some classes, agility, obedience, herding, just something.  Your dog is totally bored.  I'm sure that your neighbors don't appreciate your dog's behavior.|`|wscyjkPAaa	You have a high energy dog that needs to be exercised outside the house.  I know most people will say, "I have no time" but an hour of walking hard or 30 minutes of jogging does not really take that long.  I believe your dog does this out of boredom.  If you keep your dog always tired and mentally stimulated she will not take her energy out on the neighbor's dog.  All of those methods are short term fixes and your dog will learn to adjust to it and ignore the pain, especially since she is a rottie.|`|qhyn0vmEaa	electric fence...|`|6SeWCfUfaa	How about ... training and more structured exercise?      Get your dog into an obedience class.  Learn the "leave it" command and apply it to the fence running.  Yes, it can be done.  I'm a dog trainer and have taught many dogs not to run along the fence.    And make sure you're dog has had a proper amount of exercise.  A dog that's getting enough mental and physical stimulation will not run fences with other dogs.|`|8V1Bioxkaa	You should keep her tied up on a leash that is long enough to give her room to run around, but short enough to keep her away from the fence. you should do this for a couple of weeks.|`|lgBD4BS0aa	I would go either go invisible fence or shock collars. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, go with shock collars.|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	Innotek.com has terrific underground fences for large hard headed dogs. You can also get one with an extra hand held remote for undesirable behavior. I guarantee your dog will NOT run through. They normally won't even get close enough to be shocked but once or twice. Don't worry. It won't kill them. I actually tested it on my hand before I would use it on my dog. However, this is the ONLY brand I'll ever use again. The others just aren't very effective.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT BUY  A ELECTRIC FENCE!!  electric fences and hot wire is  curel.........you can buy a collar that emitts a sound that dogs dont like when they cross there point.Take her to the dog park or build a break wall high enuff so she doesnt see the other dog......Or train her to leave the fence alone....
L4Bnecwoaa	I wouldnt be too worried if shes only doing it in her sleep.  My first hamster used to sqeal everytime u touched it and he would grind his teeth, it turned out to be wet tail and he died a few days later.    Grinding the teeth is a classic sign that something is wrong so listen out for a clicking sound.    I dont think u have anything to worry about though by the sounds of it :)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	please consult a vet for a proper exam and evaluation. this is something that requires medical attention before it's too late.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	your hamster could be stressed so therefore is thinking about things in the night (nightmares or dream). you could ask your vet though as i haven't really heard this before :) maybe your hamster has experienced a sudden change and cannot deal with it very well.|`|ZUEFfHkBaa	She could be dreaming, lots of animals do this, my dog used to cry really loudly in his sleep. But just to be sure, why don't you ring the vet and ask? You don't have to take him there, just ask on the phone.  My hamster recently had to have his leg amputated...|`|ESKslyfsaa	Dreaming?|`|1RGsWodYaa	It is possible that it is a respiratory infection which  can lead to pneumonia. You should watch for sneezing, discharge from eyes or nose, wheezing and labored breathing. Don't worry about occasional sneezing unless there is loss of appetite, decreased activity, wheezing or difficulties breathing.|`|8QatPQfRaa	Bad dreams? Sounds like what my dog does when she is dreaming.|`|U6JMTbHeaa	either she is very sick which i doubt if she is fine during the day      or she is lonely. i hear this happens.|`|ieeq5jx8aa	dont worry myne used to do the same thing she is just dreaming that is why she only does it when shes asleep
rrLHU6ehaa	My first thought is the water temperature may be too low.  Most of the dwarf gouramis need to be kept in the 78-82o F range.  If kept at room temperature they will get lethargic and eventually die.  Honey dwarf gouramis are especially susceptible to problems caused by cool water.|`|nr9mD871aa	If you have a honey gourami survive long enough to get it in your tank you are really lucky. Honey gourami usually will not survive in the home aquarium due to the fact that they are bred so much in the trade that they are not surviving. The same thing goes for neon tetras.
8owlj2xHaa	Find a local fish store that carries live rock in your area.  Part of the large price for rock bought online is the shipping. It needs to be sent over nite, or it wont be live anymore. I do not believe in buying expensive live rock personally. Live rock will be covered by coraline algae soon enough, and maybe coral if you go that route. The bacteria and Coraline algae is not any better or worse on more expensive live rock. Your other option is to buy some dead rock and a little live rock. The live rock will seed the dead rock and soon it will all be live. Larger pieces of rock are always better than smaller. Larger rock will have more anaerobic bacteria in it.   This place sells some nice dead rock.   http://www.marcorocks.com/|`|H06PtiIAaa	That is live rock that is 100% cured and really ready for corals, plus for a 10 gallon that is usually around 40-50 pounds of rock at that price.    You can go down to the LFS and get live rock at around 4-10 dollars per pound, it is one of the more expensive parts of setting up a marine aquarium, but the best thing is you dont have to get all of it now, alittle here and there but it is something i highly recommend to put into the aquarium for biological filtration.
GT6396BDaa	The recovery period after a dog or cat is spayed or neutered is usually 7-10 days, when they get the stitches out.  However, most animals recover pretty quickly and will be running around and playing within a day or so.  Try not to let them rough house or jump too much.  The important thing is to keep an eye on the incision and watch for any redness, swelling or drainage.  If any of these things happen, you will need to take them to the vet, and may need antibiotics.  Infection rarely happens because the vet usually gives the dog or cat antibiotics right after the surgery.  Best of luck to your dog and cat.  Hope I helped.|`|PwgDhNyNaa	It depends on how old they are. But when they feel better you'll know it . Worst case is it might take a month or two.|`|8V1Bioxkaa	You should keep them apart for 2-4 days to prevent any injurys.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	About  a week or two. After they've gotten there surgery you cant allow them to play or rough house keep them away from each other for about a week as long as the wound is closed.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	They are usually back to normal after a week or so.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Ask your vet these questions when you take them in to be neutered.|`|a1XEf8lKaa	It takes sometimes longer than that depending on how big the dog is!  Maybe between 1 week and 1 month!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Depends.  Males usually bounce back pretty quick because the incisions made are small and the testicles are pretty much just popped out through a small onc stitch slit (one slit for each testicle).  For females, it's a much more complicated surgery and their recovery time is usually longer.    It's a good rule of thumb to keep them confined for a few days so they don't hurt themselves, but ... a lot of the time, the males will behave as if nothing happened at all.
6kRhLbs9aa	our little kitten had ringworm when we got her and she is healthy now...but...it was NOT fun trying to get rid of it! Just in case you did not know...ringworm is a fungus, not real worms. i did not know this until my cat had it. you can get rid of it but it can take a while. both my hubby and i caught it too even though we were ever careful touching our cat and kept her in one room until she was well. yes you need to get the carpets clean and anything else that the puppy touched. wash it twice in hot water and use bleach on anything you can. you can go to the store if one of you ends up with a spot on yourselves and get some Lamisil to put on. keep the meds on there with a bandaid. i would change it in the morning and at night. also, i got rid of my ringworm faster then my hubby using bleach on the spots that i had. i only used a Qtip and dabbed it on and then a bandaid. and yes you cat can get it by being/touching anything the pup did...so can you and your family. just get everything sterilzed and get the Lamasil. Good luck and God bless.    and no...you won't be a carrier....it is just a fungus and it goes away!|`|91CX5jHaaa	Are you gonna give away your kid if she gets athlete's foot?  Same fungus sweetie.

Take the poor puppy back, ringworms aren't AIDS. XD|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	This is a question for your vet.  I don't think that I'd take the chance of taking the dog back.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Oh good grief, it's ringworm, not the freaking plague! Ringworm is cleared up with OTC meds and is only contagious for a few days......it's not as if it requires hospitalization! What are you going to do if the dog ever really gets sick? Give him to the shelter so you don't have to deal with it? My dog had ringworm not too long ago and guess what? Nobody else got it!   Get real........|`|0hTvKlD5aa	Oh my goodness.   It's not smallpox.   No, he won't always be a carrier. You could clear it up on your own, you know. It's an ointment twice a day. I've had it before, thanks to a kitten at the shelter, and it cleared up in three days.     Your daughter will probably contact way way worse then ringworm in her life. Like lice, chickenpox, stomach flu, etc.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Ringworm really isn't that big of a deal.  Had you isolated the pup for a few days and started treatment, he wouldn't have been contagious for long and you could have kept him.    Years ago a roommate's son brought home ringworm from daycare ... *I* got it (dime-sized spot easily cured with an anti-fungal cream) but none of the other animals or people in the house did.  I suppose I could have kicked the roommate and her son out.. but why?    Not a big deal... and no, I'm not a carrier.|`|wAzNCS48aa	=( If you take the puppy to a vet they can give him a shot and it should clear it right up!    Good luck.

8i90ov0Gaa	No offense, but considering some of the questions you've recently asked about chameleons, you definitely aren't capable of caring for an Asian water monitor, one of the largest lizards in the world.

5TM9P8tsaa	*She has ISS. She must have been around another rabbit that gave it to her. She could die unless you get her to a vet. Discontinue all fresh fruits and veggies and give her only pellets and orchard grass, not alfalfa under any circumstances. Alfalfa is very bad for a rabbit. Get her to the vets asap. You will have to watch her daily with her bm's and clean her bottom every day. Baby wipes are the best thing I have found.|`|AA11618168	Ehhhh....What's up, call the doc|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	i suggest taking her to the vet. since she is brand new, often the pet store sell ill animals sometimes by accident. getting some educational materials from the vet will be helpful. she is stressed because she has been moved into a new home, and when they stress their poop will be different. pretty common among animals across the board. if you have any sort of concern over your animals health always consult a vet right away. small animals tend to die easily from illness and poor diets.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Did you give her vegetables with a low fiber and high water content (lettuce) yesterday or this morning?    If she's acting normal aside from her poop just keep an eye on her and she should be fine. Try to only feed veggies with a high fiber/high water content like carrots and NEVER fruit unless it's dried.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	It could be several thing. One, is that the stress from being in a new home could be doing it. Since this is a new bunny, are you giving it the same food she got at the store/breeder? This is VERY important-sudden changes in diet can give a bunny the runs. What are you feeding her? Too many greens will do it too. I'm not sure what else to say, without more information.|`|lG6TWd0waa	your bunny could be going into GI Stasis.....which is usually caused by points on that grow on the back molars.  the lower jaw in most bunnies is a lot narrower than the upper jaw, cos when they are weened from their mother's, they are put on high calorie diets (ie pellets....pellets were fed to bunnies for the sole purpose of getting them fat fast for selling of meat and fur, back in the day....there are no fda regulations on rabbit food, so they could sell u arsenic in a box and put a pic of a bunny on it and it can be sold).  what happens in this scenario is, the muscles grow faster than the bone, causing a malocclussion ( i know this all cos im a veterinary technician for exotic pets and bunnies are a major source of the patients we see day in and day out).  so if the jaws arent lined up, the teeth dont grind when they chew, filing them down....big problem, cos points grow, rub up against cheeks and tongue, causing pain and ulcers...which slow down a bunnies eating, which can cause stasis.  bunnies need to constantly eat and poop...any change in this, is detrimental.  i advise u find an exotics vet asap who knows how to do teeth trims and get your bunnies backmolars looked at....then try to ween him off pellets, he doesnt need them and keep him on a high salad diet...eating things like kale, parsely, collards, romaine, green and red leaf lettuces (not iceberg lettuce) chicory, dandilion greens, escarole, anything dark green and leafy.  fruits...only fresh....as treats...meaning maybe 1-2 tbs PER day only, so maybe a baby carrot in the am and a slice of apple in the pm.  thats it.  if they eat too many treat foods...they can get fat...high in sugars....treats include carrots, berries, pineapple, apples, ...........no banana....very high in sugar and calories for them.  no store bought treats either, these are high in refined sugars....which are bad, causes them to get fat...and feeds bad bacteria in their gut which will wipe out the good bacteria, causing gas and GI stasis...which will lead to death if not taken care of.  Also, no carbs or grains...so no breads or cereals and def no starches (no corn or pellet mixes that have corn and seeds and pretty colored stuff in them) this will also feed those pesky bad bacteria...and cause problems.  dont listen to others when they say greens cause diarrhea.....whats a normal wild rabbits diet.....grass....so why would leafy veggies be bad.  silly people, seriously the stuff they come up with.  if u have any bunny questions feel free to email me at surfkitten79@aol.com  ill be happy to help.
AA11193920	Put him down!    That will guarantee that he NEVER bites another person again.|`|syT3XUAraa	I would go with p m's answer. Also, you should never have an animal put down unless it is terminally ill or in a great deal of pain.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Get him and YOU into a good dog obedience class.|`|8QatPQfRaa	How old?  Sounds like he needs a lot of activity.  Walks, games, etc, and a firm "NO!".  I would pop him on the nose (tap to get his attention).  If you have a leash, loop it around his neck and through the handle like a choke chain, and keep it close under the jaw line.  If he gets out of line, give him a little tug, pulling the leash straight up and use a commanding sound or word like "no".|`|RAtgv9GHaa	You'll have to put him down,  he COULD have rabies,or atleast sounds like it.  go to a pro,like victora stillwell,she is great.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	You have a problem... and most likely you have several. Without knowing the circumstances and history, most of us are going to be offering assistance that are guesses at best. 1) Your dog has not been properly socialized. Depending on the age and temperment this may be able to be corrected. 2) Your dog is overly aggressive or fearful. 3) your dog thinks he is the "Alpha" and is making sure everybody recognizes his/her authority. You have to be the "Alpha". This may or may not be possible with your dog. I suggest you contact your local HHHS and find a trainer with experience with aggression problems. Good luck.|`|490qIIxqaa	go with jen   if it doesn't work kats|`|btHait6kaa	No don't put him down that is cruel!!! Just tell him no and pop him! If he still bites maybe you could try and get professional help, but DO NOT EVER PUT A DOG DOWN UNLESS HE IS SUFFERING AND IN EXTREME PAIN!!!!|`|wscyjkPAaa	Be the boss and take charge.  Right now he's the boss.  You need to go to dog obedience classes that specialize in dog behavior not just the sit, stay, down classes that Petco offers.  You need to walk your dog more, and sit with him at the park where you can watch people so he can get exposed to them.
dBWz9Lidaa	Yes! When I see an ad on TV showing caged bears and stuff, like made to dance and do stuff in circus's it makes me cry. I can't stand it when people do that! I hate people like that!

And they would have to rescue me with the dog or no dice. If they had told me to let go of the dog, well I would have probably decked them. That is how strongly I feel about the subject and so does my husband.     I feel that if a man can not cry there is something wrong with them. It shows you are only human and a heart as big as our Texas. Never be embarrassed over showing your emotions. If someone says something tell them to grow up. Showing emotions is not a sign of weakness but a sign of overwhelming love. If they can not show emotions they are broken.    We watched the incident with New Orleans and the animals. Do you know the police were rounding up dogs and shooting them. I just can not understand people sometimes. Understand animals better than people.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I didn't read your whole thing - I assume that it's filled with stories of animal cruelty.    I think there is a special place in h-e-l-l for people who abuse animals. And the Native Americans belive (and so do I) that when you die you have to cross a bridge into "heaven". And before you can cross the bridge you have to face all the animals you've encountered in your life and THEY decide if you get to go to heaven or not.    People who abuse animals are sick, twisted and sadistic. I think they should be abused/tortured in their preferred method of abusing/torturing animals but that's considered "cruel and unusual". Instead we have to call the animal welfare people and hope they do something.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	The man was probably thinking logically- they don't have a harness for a dog, a scared dog can wiggle and even attack, a dog wouldn't be good in a helicopter- etc. etc.    That's not animal cruelty, that's sadly doing what needs to be done in that situation. People do come first to the rescue services, and it's not as simple as saving the dog-- I'm sure the man, who's working hard doing a job most people aren't cut out for, has a dog or pets of his own at home that he loves, but for some jobs, it isn't as simple as being an animal lover.    As for crying when animals are hurt- no, sadly, I'm not that empathetic. I feel that people who abuse animals must be punished to the full extent of the law- that they are horrible, sadistic, and deserve what they get, but I've never been moved to tears by animal cruelty stories.|`|ieeq5jx8aa	I hate it when people hurt animals it is like they think they are not living things but they are!!!    hope those people who do animal crulety go to HELL!

AA10029366	Dogs are far-sighted. And they can see through the coat. The person who thinks the coat is "just for show' has clearly never seen an OES, Bearded Collie, PON, or Kommondor working in the field -- farmers don't trim their dogs' bangs.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	The answer is that they don't see very well.   Growing hair over the eyes is an example of a mutation perpetuated by breeding in a domestic situation.  It is not functional nor an advantage in terms of survival.  You'll sometimes hear the myth that it's an adaptation to protect their light sensitive eyes, but their eyes are no more sensitive to light than those of other breeds. It's like seeing through a lattice fence as the hair moves around.  Some dogs with hair over their eyes get snappy since they often don't see someone approaching  them until they're startled by the movement up close.   They lose the snappiness when the their obstructed vision is cleared by cutting the hair or tying it up into a topknot so they can see properly.  Our neighbor has an OESD that wears a topknot except in the show ring so he can see normally at other times.    You don't see any wild canids such as wolves, coyotes, or foxes with hair over their eyes, even though they grow spectacular winter coats.  Why?  It would impede their ability to hunt prey and avoid bigger predators.  It would not be an advantage and would be selected against.   Look at the feral dogs you see worldwide.   They don't have hair growing in their faces, and for the same reasons.  It would put them at a disadvantage in terms of survival and reproduction.       This analysis doesn't mean I dislike OESDs, etc.  I adore Bouvs in particular.  But I keep the hair cut short so Roux can see properly; if he were a show dog I'd put it in a topknot except while showing.    You don't see many frisbee dogs or lure coursers or agility dogs with hair in their eyes.|`|R75tldc8aa	Hair does not cause an opaque curtain.   If you put some of your hair of your eyes you can still see through it|`|1bRRODd2aa	Show dogs that are allowed to grow hair over the eyes, usually have the hair tied back when they are not in a show ring.    The hair is not a solid sheet, the dogs can see through it.|`|h8OqX12Haa	its only for show dogs so that they will meet the breed standard   and itsn ot only old english sheepdogs  and komodors there are also pulis, skye terriers,lhasa apsos  i think that its ridiculous but there are small gaps in the coat so that the dog will be able to see|`|nHP9Jq1Baa	Using 2 examples here.  A) If you have long hair, flick some over your eyes. You can still see, right? It's like that for all those dogs.  B) You know those buses that seem to have opaque pictures on the outside but from the inside can be seen through? It's also like that.  Hope you liked my answer, I'm a newb!|`|9ZTADEzTaa	Well all that is for 'show' so the dog looks good, not for practical purposes.

L22hVXTIaa	Obviously you don't want to overdo the exercise right at first, but this dog must get some exercise.  Start off slow and for short distances and gradually build up, but he needs the exercise daily.  Next, sit down with Mom and have a heart to heart talk.  Let her know that feeding the dogs everything in sight has not only made them obese (which in and of itself causes all kinds of internal problems) but can also cause digestive problems, renal and liver problems, pancreatitis (very expensive to treat), etc.  Tell her that if she loves the dogs, she has to stop - she's killing them with kindness.  At a minimum, she's shortening their lives.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Tell your Mom that you wish to have the big around for at least 10 more years and you are afraid he won't be unless the whole family agrees to do the best thing for him.   Getting him out for regular walks are good for him, maybe not lots of strenuous exercise until he looses but lots of walks will help.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	lots of exercises and a diet. take him for walks let him run and play. put him on a diet food no table scraps and feed him according to the directions on the dog food bag. it is really important to keeps dogs at there ideal weight. being over weight could cause allot of health issues and hundreds of dollars in vet bills. tell your mom it will save her money in the long run to get his weight down. good luck|`|N83Po9PZaa	Doesn't seem like it's up to you seeing as how it's not your dog....or doesn't appear to be, anyways. Maybe if your mother had 10 dogs, she's have to spread the treats out so thin, none of them would be obese. Maybe your mother likes the attention an extremely overweight dog brings HER. Maybe your family should gang up on her and make her do better towards the animal.    Can you fake cry over the dog to get her to feel sorry for you and stop killing it with food. She might need something to indulge...you can take that bullet, right?|`|lmSffrNuaa	Help him feel satisfied by adding low-calorie, high-fiber foods to his bowl. These can include fresh steamed green beans, low-sodium canned green beans, and plain canned pumpkin. Your dog will still feel as if he's getting a lot of food; he just won't be taking in as many calories.    Check this link for more info.  http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rx7.html|`|QuAFPRQCaa	The most important thing to remember is that just like people, the weight was not put on "overnight" so you can't take it off over night.  It will take a combination of diet and exercise.  You MUST get your mom to STOP!!! Maybe you could get your vet to sit down with your mom and explain the consequences.  Their are a lot of different exercises for dogs--walking, agility, running, playing games like fetch, etc.  In the summer take him to the lake often.  Just like for us humans, swimming is one of the best sources of exercise.|`|btHait6kaa	Walk him everyday and keep him on a strict diet!!:)
Zv7aPjcQaa	She is VERY cute!   My suggestions would be: black Lab, Australian Shepherd, German Shepherd, Border collie, Sheltie, um..I'm out of guesses, sorry.   Here is a website you can use. I did find out what my dog was.  EXACTLY what he was.   Go to http://www.canineheritage.com   You'll have to pay for it--about $155   They will send directions of how you get your dogs saliva to send to them.  Send a picture of her so it can go on her Breed Certification.   Good luck and its really fun and its great knowing exactly what your dog is mixed with.   Again,  VERY cute dog...|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	It slightly looks like a lurch (sheep dog & greyhound mix)|`|vPde97E2aa	TA-DAH!

Definitely lab, but I can't tell if she is graying because she is older or graying because of her mix?    Whatever she is, she has gorgeous eyes and I bet she is a total love bug.    Thank you for considering a mix =)    Very sweet girl.|`|3hvTKCq3aa	it looks like a mutt/mongreal mix  but very cute
1bRRODd2aa	You have addressed this problem in an earlier question. I can only repeat the advice I gave in that answer -    You need to fix the food aggression now. A technique that works quite well is to hand feed her from her bowl. Get her thinking that your hand near her food is a positive thing. Teach her LEAVE and DROP as soon as possible.     If you don't do this and get her accepting of people messing around with her food you are going to end up with a seriously dangerous dog, the Vizsla is a big dog with a potentially bad bite.    You should have just let her eat the regurgitated food, it wasn't vomit. It wouldn't have done her any harm and will have planted the idea in her mind that you were "stealing" her food; not a good impression to make on a food agressive dog.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	what you are doing is wrong...when see shes you and you take the bowl away it means she has to protect her bowl every time you go near her....or when you come by you take her to pen.All you have to do is get her bowl put it on the floor with no food and have her sit and place one kibble in her bowl then another so every time she sees your hand or you it means more food for her.Or put a little bit of food in the bowl and stand there don't get scared when she growls because she"ll she you are less dominant then she is....i suggest eating before she eats or pretending to eat out of her bowl.Another a thing to do is when shes eating stand by her and if doesn't growl say good girl and give her a treat(ham or chicken something she"ll rather have then kibbles)  that way standing by her or petting her when shes eating is a good thing not a bad thing.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Food aggression is something you do not want to allow to get worse.    One of the things you can start doing is measure out your dogs kibble into a regular bowl.  Put their empty dog bowl down where they normally eat.  Then, start putting the dogs kibble into their bowl one or two kibbles at a time.  They get the idea pretty quick that your hand by their dog dish is a GOOD thing.    You can also start working on sit and wait.  Ask the dog to sit and wait for you to put the kibble in their dish.  This really established a dogs role in a household.  He who controls the food, is in charge.    Pups are never too young to start learning the basics like, sit and wait.  So no free lunches for this little one.  Every kibble should be worked for.|`|nYv65TlEaa	this should of started from when you brought her home,when feeding from a bowl,your hand should of been partly in the bowl so she would of got used to your hand and she would of known you were not going to take it,    Hand feed her now for a few week and then try the bowl again,but make sure you hand is in the bowl if she starts to growl,take the bowl away,she'll soon find you are the boss    one of my girls does it to my other dogs only,never me,they couldn't even walk by while she was eating,so i took her bowl away,and brought it back,if she growled again,i took it away...

afPzgCSHaa	Yes it's normal!  My puppy's nose was almost black!  now its dark pink.  :)|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Yes, it is called a "Snow Nose". The pigmentation lightens. It is totally normal.    All my my goldens, labs, huskies, and other mixes in my rescue have gotten this.    I guess the easiest way to put this (though its not entirely right, there's more to it) is this. In the winter time, our skin usually gets lighter. In the summer, for the most part it darkens. Similar to a snow nose.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	It's not "totally normal."      A nose going from black to pink can  be a sign of an autoimmune disease called "discoid lupus."  You should take the dog to a vet and let THEM tell you if it's something you should worry about or not.|`|QuAFPRQCaa	Different things can cause the color of a dog's nose to change.  I had a dog with a shiny black nose.  She was stung by a bee right on the nose (you know how dogs like to sniff the flowers where bees live).  Within a couple of hours her nose was pink.  Her nose remained pink for the rest of her 12 years of life.
gU34xa9vaa	I'm so glad you found Pong,you must have been so relieved ! As others have already said, Pong will smell different now to Ping because of being shut in the garage, but when things settle down they should be OK again together.It's a good idea meanwhile to exchange their scents, rub a tiny bit of soft material around Ping's whisker beds, then use the same piece and do it to Pong, then Ping again, then Pong again, do it a few times very gently and they'll start rubbing themselves on it too.  Don't worry about Ping whacking Pong, it's just something cats do and as long as they don't hurt each other,they'll sort themselves out.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Pong was traumatized and he will get over it. a few swats won't hurt them. Just keep an eye on both of them and they should settle down soon.|`|ArBOK95aaa	Ping might not recognize Pong, if Pong got into something and smells differently.    try taking a damp cloth and rubbing Ping down, then rub Pong down with that cloth (you could even rub Pong down with a different cloth first to try to remove what ever scent is lingering)    You could try isolating Ping if it is really bad.  Lock her in a bathroom or bed room for a couple of hours while Pong walks around the house.  This should help calm Ping down, and help Pong start to smell like the house again, and have the house smell like Pong.    I've also found that bribes of super yummy treats also help cats forget that they are quarreling.  feed them at the same time, should help dispel any issues.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Pong doesn't smell the same, so Ping is not too sure about her.  The same thing happens when one of my cats goes to the vet and the others don't.  The cat doesn't smell familiar any more so the others will react accordingly.  I suspect that Ping will stop hissing at Pong once Pong has had a chance to bathe herself really well and begins to smell more like her old self.  You can help this process along a little by rubbing Ping with a dry cloth or towel, then rubbing Pong with the same towel.  This will give Pong a scent that is a little more familiar to Ping and may help her to settle down a little.  At any rate, this behavior usually only lasts for about 24-48 hours at most when it happens at my house after a vet visit.  I'm sure Ping will settle down soon.|`|AA10898750	cats react to smell more than sight they have good night vision and poor vision over all so rub the other cat with both hands then rub the other cat with the same hand the smell of both cats will blend and they should calm down use your scent to blend also i know it sounds gross but rub your hands across your arms and legs and then rub each cat they mark you and the house with their scent the oils in their fur or bathe both cats and then rub them down|`|V7pXzNKNaa	It's like a riddle..."Ping did this, Pong did this, which one's which?"  Anyways, if they've been getting along before your cat got trapped, they should be fine. I think that Ping may be rude to Pong, because when Pong was gone that night, Ping probably tried to take advantage and claim you and your family as her own property, so when Pong returned, she became frustrated to see that not all of the attention is on her anymore. (But again, I don't know, because it was just one night.) Whenever Ping "whacks" Pong, scold her, so she can learn what's right and wrong.|`|mR5RkClpaa	ping is only doing this because it thinks that pong is going to start trouble, it is alarmed at all the fuss pong was making , and is just making sure pong is not grtting too big for its boots,ping knows pong was making a fuss about something so it is pings way of stopping it before it gets out of hand, they will quiten down in their own time, ping could also be thinking pong was going for you so ping is protecting you , i have had this also|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Yes, as rrm38 has said, it is all down to smell.  Do some scent exchanging as suggested and they should each become accustomed to each others scent again.  When you see them together and they are not hissing, throw down some treats so that they associate being together as a good thing.

There still are the true Jack Russell Terriers, recognized by the JRTCA and not the AKC (thank God!)    Smooth Coats- a coat that does not have trace hairs on the head, face, legs, or body. A smooth coat does not require any alterations to be ready for the show ring. The coat should not be sparse or soft - it should provide protection from the elements. It is double coated.    Broken Coat- a coat that is very similar to a smooth coat but has trace hair on the head, face, legs, or body. A broken coat needs minimal alterations to be ready for the show ring. They will generally only require a quick tidying up. A broken coat should not be soft - it should be harsh to provide protection from the elements. Brokens are double coated.    Rough Coats- a coat that has excess trace hair on the head, face, legs, or body. The hair is longer than on a smooth or broken coat. A rough coat requires more alterations than a broken coat to be ready for the show ring. A rough coat should not be soft or wooly - it should be harsh to provide protection from the elements. Roughs are double coated.    Trace Hair- uncontrollable lengths of hair that does not lay close to the body.    Yes it is possible to tell what coat type the pup will grow up and have.
AA10029366	Puhleeeze. They were 13 week old puppies, playing.    ...Do you actually know anything about dogs, little troll?|`|z6RmVT5xaa	Don't worry - they're puppies having a glorious time!  All small creatures love to romp and play.  If you watch carefully they'll all race madly for a while, then all chase one who then reverses it and chases a different one.  They get their games tangled up and run over each other but just bounce right back up.  They growl and carry on and shake each other and wail (which immediately stops whatever is currently going on) and then suddenly they're all exhausted and drop in a heap to snuggle and rest.    This is an example of puppies at their best, sharing a glorious and healthy "exercise program" while developing their muscles and agility.  Don't worry but rather rejoice that they have the chance to play together.  And boy are they fun to watch!  One year there was a little tiny white poodle who was half the size of any of the others but twice as energetic.  When the pup she was playing with would drop with exhaustion she'd race off and find another twice her size to play with.  She had a glorious time!|`|eceLQUj5aa	Hahaha that is called playing. Those were puppies, it is natural behavior. Notice the complete lack of blood and death.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	Most puppy's play rather roughly, in particular large breeds. Its nothing more.

eceLQUj5aa	Unfortunately he may be rabid, just in an early stage.    Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease. Three stages of rabies are recognized in dogs and other animals. The first stage is a one to three day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the prodromal stage. The second stage is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days. It is this stage that is often known as furious rabies due to the tendency of the affected dog to be hyperreactive to external stimuli and bite at anything near. The third stage is the paralytic stage and is caused by damage to motor neurons. Incoordination is seen due to rear limb paralysis and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles. Death is usually caused by respiratory arrest.[5]|`|AA12128656	your dog has found something yummy in the carpet. or likes the way it feels.

We had a fantastic mixed breed dog when I was a child, he was part greyhound and cocker spanial. He leterally saved my brothers life when he was a young boy of 3.The dog got between a rattlesnake and my brother and refused to move, he barked his head off until my father came out with a gun and killed the snake.The dog lived to be nearly 17 yeas old.I always wish we would of taken him on more walks etc. but kids can be lazy.  As an adult we had Doberman Pincher, it was my husbands first pet ever in his life.He was named Max and became another child in our home.He lived to be 12 and we have cremated him and he is sleeping by our bed waiting for me to join him someday.

And the miraculous thing about this that we've only had four during that time, all but one rescue dogs.  I was absolutely amazed to realize how lucky we've been to have such long-lived animals.  We've also had two cats and one rat and every single one of our animals has gotten along beautifully with every other one they encountered.

GenpGk7Daa	Often, the way your rat acts can have many meanings. How new is your rat? If she/he is new, it might just not be used to you yet. If it is a long-time rat, how often do you play with it? Lastly, it could just be your rat's natural temperament. Rats can be outgoing, shy, skittish, mean or a clown. Try feeding your rats treats like:  1. Honey comb cereal (my rats go crazy over that stuff)  2. Cheerios  3. Broccoli  4. Rat Treats  Feed these by hand and your rat will link you with its favorite treats.|`|pK7saLw4aa	how new is the rat and how do often do you handle it? this could affect the rat. also, give your rat toys and stuff that will make it like you

Uy79dKEmaa	I think there are several possibilities for you. Do not give up hope!    I am allergic to cats, so I have some experience I can share with you.    When I got my first cat, I had allergic reactions all the time. I was already in love with her, so rehoming was not an option. At first, I simply took precautions like making sure to wash my hands after handling her, frequent brushing and vacuuming, making sure there was no cat hair on my pillow, etc. After a few months, most of my symptoms had subsided--I had developed a tolerance--but I still had the occasional reaction.    So, next step was consulting my doctor. It took a couple tries, but we found a combination that works great for me. I take a Claritin before bed every night. Claritin is available OTC now and is available in generic form called Loratidine (you can save lots of money if you go with the generic). Then I use Nasonex in the morning. It works like a charm!    There are so many allergy meds available now, you might need to experiment to find the right one or combination for you. I like the Claritin because it lasts 24 hours and does not make me drowsy at all.    If the regular meds don't work for you, you can go to an allergy specialist and get shots that control your allergies. I have some friends that go that route, and it works for them, but I can do without the regular trips to the doctor. lol    I'm sure you can find something that can work for you. Hope this helps|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Antihistamines sometimes work.    You know how a vaccine works? Basically they shoot a small portion of the disease into your body and the body basically learns how to fight the disease. For me, I was allergic to cats too. Loving animals, when a stray decided to make me a part of its life and come into my home, I just dealt with it. I don't remember how long it took but eventually, my allergies went away|`|y1Fihj3Maa	I am unsure about vaccines for allergy's.  I would encourage you to continue your dream of becoming a vet tech.  Allergy's can be dealt with daily meds, and you may find that your allergies will change as you get older.  I am also allergic to cats, and have 4 living with me now.  I've passed my allergies to my children, both whom are pet lovers, pet owners.  One of my daughters is heading for Vet school, and currently works as a wild animal rehabilitator.  I would rather sneeze than never have the opportunity to love a cat!!  Go for it, there are many cats out there that will need your love and attention.|`|RqlPSyrzaa	There are medications. Ask your doctor.  Also, I have a friend who's allergic to cats and is in vet school, so as long as you're not seriously allergic (as long as it's just a runny nose, itchy sort of thing), it can be done without shots. Claritin helps.   So I say go for it. Be a vet tech.   -Walter (http://thethingspetsdo-wc.blogspot.com/)  Also, in line with what the guy above said, I was allergic too, took in two cats, and after about three months all symptoms of my allergies were completely gone.
nBKs8fk4aa	The light usually provides the snake with heat.  Is this a Heat lamp, or just a regular UVB bulb?    But again the Heat lamp provides the snake with heat.  this is necessary for warmth and digestion.  If you cant afford to by a new light its ok, snakes can go for a couple a days or maybe a week without their light, just make sure you place him/her in a sunny spot in your room for a while and thatshouldd be suffice.      What you should look into is anUnder tankk Heater.  This allows the snake to have heatwheneverr he feels like it.   Just make sure you place the matt on one side of the tank (usually the empty side with no hide box or water bowl), this gives the snake a second option for a heat source.  Hope I Helped|`|RqlPSyrzaa	This really depends on what the temperature in his cage si without the light. If your house is fairly warm, and thus his cage is fairly warm, he should be fine in the meantime. He'll merely reduce his activity level, and be more lethargic than normal. But it'll be okay so long as you get the light as soon as possible.  If your house is cold, and his temperature really drops low (below 70), then his health is at risk. If it drops low enough, his life is at risk.  But so long as his temperature doesn't drop too low, it'll be fine if you get it as soon as possible.   -Walter (http://thethingspetsdo-wc.blogspot.com/)|`|3IUMh4Igaa	If this is a heat lamp and you can't get one right now.

m0e3a3gWaa	I would just put it in the tank.  These could take months to fully leech out.    The Tanins won't harm your fish and if you add some fresh carbon it will take out the color.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	I wouldn't' put it in your tank. As you purchased it,  I would take it back! Explain whats been going on and ask for your money back.|`|nr9mD871aa	Where did you get this driftwood? Also, are you waterlogging it or something else.|`|smhsKWAmaa	The drift wood is leeching tannins, and it will continue for quite a while, i have had 2 small pieces of drift wood in a 10 gallon and they have been changing the color of the water for over 6 months now.  The only thing the drift wood will do is change the color of your water to a brownish tint, imo it gives a planted tank a nice natural look.  The drift wood may lower your hardness, so if you have fish that like softer water or if you have pretty hard tap water then the tannins will actually help that.  You are fine to put the drift wood in the tank, if you don't mind a little color change.      If you wish to speed up the process then you can try boiling it, several times, it will still leech for a while but it will speed up the process. But personally, i would just put the wood in the tank.     hope this helps

Cept for in the RV and car and shows.|`|3zv2bbolaa	I would enroll myself and my dog into obedience training classes as soon as possible.|`|vPde97E2aa	ROTFLMAO...........MY dogs are NOT allowed any such HORRENDOUS behavior!|`|V5akMpDAaa	send him to the pound|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Get them and yourself into an obediene class, asap.|`|gWYArJ0Haa	Caesar Mullan.. the Dog guy!! give him a call|`|nYv65TlEaa	what do you mean he was like that until today?did you get him put down?|`|fMRcX2WDaa	get him into training!!! pet smart 109.00 for eight week beginner training works wonders. will help you learn how to teach him properly. its lots of fun for you and him. it will help you to bond so he will be loyal to you.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	Pay more attention to the dog, and if unable to, crate him to prevent further disasters. Also, take him to an obedience class. Your dog obviously lacks order, and would be much happier with rules, boundries, and a leader.    What do you mean by, "until today"?|`|9kTejB0uaa	I'd sit back and consider who is in charge of your household, you or your dog!  Once you have that sorted out, you take this hooligan to training classes!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	If I were your dog, I'll get myself another owner, one that would take me to obedience class. You have not set any boundaries, and there is no need to get mad at the dog or use negative enforcement. Any dog would respond very well to positive reinforcement methods like clicker training. In all your training you need to be consistent. Read more on dog training on my website and follow the links to other excellent dog training sites.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Putting your dog in a kennel is wrong. It should never be used as punishment. Secondly I think this question is a joke because a dog doesn't just wake up well behaved. If for some crazy reason this is a true question, you and your dog needs obedience because you have no clue the temperment of a lab... or know how to treat any dog to begin with.|`|7e22a1b7de650843d2dd580cc4ddb41aaa	take him to dog training classes|`|Zv7aPjcQaa	LOL! Sounds like MARLEY to me =)    EDIT- OMG! YOUR DOG IS SOOOO CUTE!|`|q28VSNueaa	Well first of all,  did you just recently get your dog?  If so, were did it come from?  You have to look at the dogs background to try to figure out where some of the behaviors come from.    If the dog is in a new environment then maybe it just took it sometime to feel everything out and now he is trying to see what he can get away with.      I would talk to a professional dog behaviorist or your Vet.  It's really hard to say why a dog would just suddenly start behaving this way unless there has been some type of major change in the dogs environment.
y7igESfUaa	Cats are actually awake during the early morning and early evening (dusk and dawn) although they will adjust to our schedules.    That's the hard part. When you're at work, he's learned to adjust his schedule to sleep then. When you come home is the time he wants to be awake, when he can spend time with you. However, obviously, you want to sleep. Therefore, he tries to wake you up since you've been gone all night.    I would suggest playing with him when you get home. Try to 'poop him out' before you go to bed. That way, he can at least take a cat nap when you go to sleep so he'll leave you alone (for a little longer).    Good luck to you and your little guy!

L22hVXTIaa	As you know, gardens are home to lots of critters - not just birds.  There could be burrowing animals out there too like rabbits, moles, gophers, etc.  It may be that she's just letting your know.  Bats tend to fly around at night after insects and she may have been barking at them rather than the moon.  Dogs also hear and smell many things that we can't, and your dog is young, exuberant and trying to assert her authority over her property against unwanted trespassing animals.  Next time you take her out, go with her and explore a little with a flashlight, you may see what's got her riled up\ and she's less likely to bark if you're right along with her.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	your dog is probably over whelmedwhen outside like to say what in the world is that.....just let her out more and teach her to ssssssh be quiet!|`|SzfSeqplaa	well may be he is finding something difficult to see there.I am sure after a while it will adjust.|`|9ZTADEzTaa	It's hard to stop a dog barking if it really wants to. Make sure that it gets enough exercise, and try scolding the dog when it barks too much, some dogs are obviously more obedient than others so this may not work.   Squirting water at the dog everytime it barks may also work|`|lmSffrNuaa	Generally, there are eight reasons why dogs bark:        * Territorial or defensive barking      * Excitement, or happiness at seeing you      * Play and exercise      * To get your attention or to signal you (i.e. "I have to go potty!")      * Aggravation over not being able to attain something (such as your pork chop).      * Social barking in response to other dogs      * Separation anxiety and trepidation      * Compulsive behavior     Check this link for more info.  http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/sns.html|`|K8t1lPXsaa	it can depend on the breed but constant barking is usually a sign of boredom. i would recommend get a good quality ultrasonic device but not the collars. it emits a high pitched sound that will distract the dog and make it not want to bark. it won't hurt it in any way.     the hand held and the plug ins work the best. with the hand helds you need to be near them and point it at them when they bark. the electric plug ins respond to barking on it's own anywhere from10-50ft away but some of the sensitive ones pick other sounds and go off even if your dog isn't barking. i trained my yorkie not to bark with one and he learned within a few minutes. now i don't even use it anymore|`|wAzNCS48aa	There could be a creature that she sees. I suggest one night taking a flash light out there and seeing what all the fuss is about.
3zv2bbolaa	I would recommend scheduling an appointment for both to be spayed and neutered. If your dog is having prostate problems, neutering is the answer.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	Let him calm down some where quiet and keep him away your brothers dog.Get them both fixed so they can live happy and healthy with no worries and you can relax.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	There isn't much you can do about him being excited except is now the perfect time for neutering.  Do it asap or you will will having some really ugly puppies & yes it is possible.  Don't put this off any longer he needs to be done not only for his health but to prevent any litters esp. since you are not living on your own. Your brother needs to take his dog in also when she is finished.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Little dogs are especially prone to this,  though it happens to the big guys also.  It'll take care of itself if you put him in a nice quiet area; the blood will gradually drain out and it will retract back into the sheath.  If you really want him to be able to get it back in sooner, set him in a bath of cool/slightly cold water.  That will speed up the process.  As odd as it looks, especially on a Dachshund, it's OK and he won't hurt himself.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yea, in the dog world, we call that a red rocket.    Get the dog neutered.  It's not anything serious, he's just turned on with no relief.  Getting him neutered will lessen his drive.  Waiting to get him neutered will likely cause behavioral problems that will be tough to tackle even if you get him neutered later on.      Get him to the vet, ASAP.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Okay - the first thing you have to do is remove the ****** in season from anywhere near this poor lad.  Small wonder he got excited and he's now suffering as a result.  Mechanically, provided the sheath isn't back behind the bulb (top of the penis) taking him away from the girl and allowing him to calm down should do the trick.  However, sometimes it is necessary to have the vet sort this out - it is a dangerous situation if this has happened, and I suggest you get him seen to asap.  His prostate will be affected if he's having to live with this in-season ****** without being able to satisfy himself (putting it as carefully as I can here!)    Oh good, I've just seen your add-on.  Now get him out of the house (boarding?) until the resident girl is out of season.  It will be far kinder to him in the long-run.    Before your vet will do the castration, he will run the rule over your dog to make sure he's fit to have the surgery (anaesthetic etc.)   8 isn't too old - I've had to have my Bassets of that age castrated (prostate flare up) and they were fine.  Be aware, it takes several months for the effects of the neutering to take effect.  He won't be able to sire puppies from immediately afterwards but he will still have the urges.|`|nYv65TlEaa	make sure he is in a clean area,he may have a shocked look on his face,he will not move yet,he will clean it,just let him be,had my guy stuck iwht my gal for over 40 min,so just leave him alone    as his butt,his anul glads may need cleaning,does he scoot after he poops,don't move him if his penis is out,just give him time,in the meantime call the vet and let the vet know what happened    you better keep the male away from the gal from 8th day of start of heat,till about her 23rd day,i had my gal get pregnant on day 21|`|y2ywR3X9aa	my puppy did that when he went to town on a giant care bear and scared the **** out of me! I thought it was stuck out like that and I freaked but in a little while it went down and he was fine. Never heard it called the red rocket but it certainly describes what I saw. New experience for me as this is the first boy dog I have had. He will be getting fixed soon. very soon.
GenpGk7Daa	Yes. Dumbo rats are regular rats with their ears on the side of their heads. However, do you have homes for all the babies? Your rat can have up to 24, though it is likely only 12 will survive. I breed rats, but I always find at least 12 homes before putting two together. Otherwise, I would have a lot of sickly, inbreeding rats that no one wanted. Also, are you willing to sell your babies as snake food? ask yourself all these questions before you breed.|`|0Wn5EwaWaa	Yes There is no harm in it. Dumbos are simply another breed of rat but fancy rats and dumbos are the same species. But you should know a few things about breeding them first. A rat reached puberty at  about 6 weeks of age for  male and female. A female rat has a heat period after she gives birth.Meaning she can conceive one litter after just giving birth to the first one. For this reason the dad should be removed following the conception of the first litter. Using the post partum estrus will only overstress the doe. I have seen females die from overbreeding. Another thing to consider is the fact that breeding is stressful for the female. She can have up to 15 pups in a litter and then she has to feed them. Your normally placid    rats  will be very protective over the young. You should also not breed her after 2 years as she is elderly and it can complicate the pregnancy and cause you to lose her.  Many pet stores wont buy fancy rats or will only give store credit. And if you go the pet store route to adopt out the young you have no guarantee that they wont end up on a reptiles menu.  I would only breed if you have homes set up for the ratty children.
AA12203329	Ya dognip is almost impossible to find now-a-days...HAHA|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I have never seen that one, they will hide the cats toys but that is just a game to them, the cats have NO trouble getting them back when they want them. Only one of my cats like the stuff.|`|Nbozr7Dcaa	It is some kind of mint.  Wow, I didn't know dogs like it. Maybe it's Canine-abis!|`|3jyMwDDgaa	Lol. Most dogs will eat almost anything. Usually, cat food has a stronger smell, and if it's moist, that just adds to it. My dogs prefer cat food over dog food any day. I'm pretty sure it's not as healthy for a dog, though.        ~Sara|`|IzRk1mZQaa	When I was a child I had a cocker spaniel who loved catnip, and would roll around in it with the cats!!!   It won't hurt him, it's good fiber.  I've never had another dog who enjoyed, most of them just never seemed phased by it.|`|mJPYhoDQaa	Let me tell you this when I read the some of the answers you got I got pissed off!  I don't know why a dog would like it. It may smell really good too him. At leased you know what you can train him with lol!|`|RqlPSyrzaa	My dog loves it, too. I don't think it's restricted to only cats liking it just because of the name. But I'm not sure how good or bad it is for dogs, so I'd keep it away from him, if at all possible.   -Walter (http://thethingspetsdo-wc.blogspot.com/)
4aAhEK9daa	"please dont lecture me about getting a cat from a rescue center"    No lecture.  But I do hope your parents understand they're going to have to pay about $300-$400 to get this kitten spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, deflead, dewormed and tested for disease.  Had you gotten this kitten from a shelter you would have adopted a cat or kitten that's already had all these things done for an adoption fee of around $100.    "I am planning on keeping the kitten in my room at night, but how will it be able to get to the litter tray? Can young kittens get down and up stairs? There is no way I could keep a litter tray in my bedroom, and the bathroom is downstairs."    Well sorry - but you're going to HAVE to have the litter near the kitten.  It's going to be too small to be expected to trek up and down the stairs simply to go to the bathroom.  You also should keep the kitten in your room for at LEAST several days - if not a week - so your cat can SLOWLY get used to having a newcomer in your house.  You should have its food, water and litter in your room and keep the door shut.  Put an old tshirt with the new kitten to get its scent on it and then bring the tshirt to the existing cat.  Do this back and forth a few times and don't allow the two of them to interact until they're a) both acting relaxed and eager to know what's beyond the door and b) the kitten's been fully checked out by a vet - including testing for FIV and Feline Leukemia.    "How do i settle the kitten?"    Not sure what you mean by this.  If you mean how to get it to sleep at night then give it lots of one on one playtime with you during the day and especially so right before bedtime.     "How do I introduce the kitten to the family cat?"    Already answered that above.    "I have already bought the kitten her own cat tree with 4 levels. Our cat also has her own one."    I do hope you realize that you won't be able to teach the cats that this is yours, this is hers.  They'll play wherever they feel like playing.    "I just use the disposible kind, as it's a lot easyer to just pick up and throw away the whole thing when the cat has finished eating, than washing it every meal."    That's VERY wasteful.  Instead of filling the landfill with bowls buy some metal or ceramic bowls and wash them daily.  It's REALLY not that difficult!     "A collar"    Collars are not only unnecessary but they're a CHOKING HAZARD.  Do not put one on your cat.  Have your vet microchip it so it can be returned to you if it gets out.  I hope you intend to keep this kitten indoors.  If not and you're not aware of how dangerous it is outdoors for cats then read this http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...    "What else do you suggest I do?"    Get the kitten spayed or neutered RIGHT AWAY.  At 11 weeks it will already be ready.  Kittens can be spayed or neutered once they're eight weeks in age and two pounds in weight.  A kitten can reach sexual maturity as early as four months old so it's quite foolish to wait until it's six months - like some behind the times vets do.|`|80S8U7Edaa	What about grooming supplies?  You should check this site out for some cool stuff:    http://www.gingerpuplane.com/shop-cat/c2...|`|POL813fYaa	wow. sounds like your busy. haha taking care  of a n animal is hard work, but of course you know that. make sure you are near your kitten for at least the first couple days. don't leave it for more then 2 hours at a time.unless your sleeping. encourage the kitten to sleep with you. bring it up onto your bed. if it really doesn't want to sleep with you, it will move. but 4 this kitten it will be scary, so i suggest not getting it a jingly collar. it will freak the poor thing out. the kitten will introduce itself to the family cat. when u get it, out it near the cat. if the cat hisses, take the kitten away. all in good time. don't MAKE the kitten do anything major. no company, no sleepovers, your main priority is this kitten, well, have fun!!|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Get another litter tray and put it in or somewhere around your room.  Yes kittens can climb stairs if taught.  So why can't you keep a litter tray in your room?  It won't stink if you clean it.  I'm also 13 and I have a guinea pig in my room and he SMELLS but only if I don't clean his cage.  The kitten will introduce itself to the family cat ( or it should) Ha ha.  I think you have it all for her already! What a spoiled little kitty she will be! Ha ha.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	A kitten should be able to see everything it needs from one position and when it first arrives in a new home it should not have to hunt around for anything.  Therefore, you cannot expect it to be in your bedroom and know that it has to go up/down stairs to find a litter tray.  If the kitten is going to be in your room then that is where the litter tray has to be.  Also, each cat should have its own tray so you really need to find space somehow for an extra tray, even if it means putting down two slightly smaller ones.  Making 2 cats use one litter tray can lead to toileting problems.     To start with it might be best if you confine your kitten to a room of its own overnight (a bathroom is fine as long as you keep the toilet seat down) with everything in there that it needs, including of course its litter tray.  When it is using the tray properly you can very gradually start to let the kitten have the run of the house and also very gradually (a couple of feet a day) move its tray to the place you want it to be (such as your landing).  By then it will know where its litter facilities are and you will be able to have it in your bedroom knowing that he will get himself to the right place.    The other reason for giving the kitten its own room is that you will need to introduce him slowly to your existing cat.  Dont just take him home and plonk him down or you will not get a pleasant reaction.  Do some scent marking (wipe a cloth around the kitten's face where its scent glands are and then wipe the same cloth over your older cat), carry the kitten around so your older cat can see it without having actual contact.  You should be able to guage the reaction of your older cat and if after a couple of days he seems calm when he sees the kitten, then you can start to let them meet properly, but never leave them together unattended until you are absolutely sure that they will be ok - this can take a few weeks but be patient.  Do the introduction slowly and properly and things should be fine.  When you see them together, throw down some treats so that they associate being together as a good thing.|`|V7pXzNKNaa	Aw, I'm an animal lover too. :-)  And I wish I had enough money to spoil my cat, ha.  Well, so far it seems like you're doing a great job to welcome the kitten. I'd recommend that you move the litter box, because kittens have a difficult time climbing stairs.   Another thing: When you feed your kitten, make sure it's not dry food, because their teeth aren't developed to chew dry food yet. When my cat was a kitten, I fed her wet food. (Like the one's that are flavored in cans.) Kittens might be able to eat dry food, but I think it's more conveniant for them to eat wet food.  Sleeping: When I had a kitten she was quite clingy. If you keep her in your bedroom, she'll try jumping on your bed to sleep with you, which might be a lil' dangerous, because of her size, ha. If you want her to sleep with you, pick her up yourself, but be alarmed that she might jump off anytime to explore the rest of your room. What I'd do, is make or buy a lil' bed for her.  If you family cat enjoys playing with the kittens you mentioned earlier, I think that the cat will like the new kitten. If not, just give them some time to get used to eachother.   Good luck. :-)|`|3f91cqbSaa	From fostering 3 kittens over the summer, heres some ideas. When it came to litter training, you are gonig to have to show him or her where the cat box is so he or she will know. If you are going to keep him./her in your room i would suggest getting a small pan (so he/she can step into it) and fill it with a little bit of litter so that way she/he will have somewhere to go until shes old enuogh to get up and down the stiars by herself. As for intoducing him/her to the older cat, just sit there with the kitten in your lap and with the older cat and just kind of let them introduce themselves, be sure its supervised so nothing happens, if the older cat has been around kittens before, i would think he/she wouldnt have a problem with the kitten. Toys are great and provide entertainment for him/her just be sure hes not going to chew anything lol, kittens are know for liking to chew. hope this helpd you out. have fun with your new ktiten|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	I'm glad you excited and that is a very lucky kitten to be coming home to such love and anticipation.    I agree with everything the other have said.  The kitten may have a hard time handling stairs at first, especially if she never had been around them before.  May I suggest that you get those disposable litter boxes.  They are the ones that people use when they are traveling with their cat.  You can put that in your bedroom until the kitten settles in and learns to handle the stairs well.
tPGxPDvBaa	Yes if you want to stop the bleeding & make sure it is cleaned properly & bandaged if needed.  It is a painful injury & usually beyond basic owner care.|`|AA11992723	your dog is in a lot of pain..you should then ask the vet how to equip yourself so you can handle it at home if this ever happens again but it will depend.|`|AA12128656	yes- it's extremely painful, and it's an area VERY susceptible to infection.|`|AA10283080	Would you take your child to the doctor if one of it's nails were ripped off it's finger?    Yes....take your dog to the vet.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Yes.    That happened to my "Abby", and I took her in, she was on Clavamox tabs for a week.|`|jQglJiMhaa	if you have a lot of disposable money than yes, but in reality NO, there is not reason, and pain killers are not good for dogs, their livers don't deal with them well, just clean it up, and wrap it up and it will heal in no time.    Our german short-haired pointer ripped hers off and all we did was put qwik stop on it and bandage it up, and it was perfectly fine.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	This happened to my cat, and we ended up getting the toe removed, I imagine it's about the same with dogs.  Take your dog soon before infection sets in, and get him a good painkiller!!|`|NEfngXeXaa	yes|`|nHP9Jq1Baa	That depends on how severe the bleeding is. You might want to use some kind of swab to get rid of any dirt, then put on a thick, cushiony dressing, to keep out dirt and make it hurt less until it heals. The only real concerns are that the dog might lose too much blood (unlikely) or that it's wound might get infected.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	Yes. It is a very active area for infection, and quite painful.|`|An2AopAqaa	Well it all depends really. Spray it with some anitseptic and see how it goes. Put some ice on it to take the swelling down, all the usual things you to with a human.     The choice is yours but it probably just looks worse than it is. My dog's claw ripped off before and she bled and limped but it she never went to a vet and it healed quickly.     If we took our pets to the vet everytime they had a minor injury they'd cost us thousands of pounds! But like I said, it's up to you.     Hope she gets better soon. [:|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Should you be taken to the emergency if your toe fell off from your foot or if you sprained your ankle?? What makes you think your pain tolerance is lower than a dogs????|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	yes.  my ridgeback mix did the same thing the other day. off to the vets we went. they trimmed it down (it was hanging by a thread), cauterized it to stop the bleeding and prescribed antibiotics.  it's easy for an infection to set in, then it'll cost even more.  $90.00.|`|QCgvxwCzaa	Why are you asking us this quesiton? You should be asking yourself how much you care about your dog and how responsible you choose to be!|`|r4vovvtdaa	Of course you should!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3hvTKCq3aa	yes she is probably in a lot of pain|`|LfZk2NGBaa	I am going to go against everyone in this but NO you don't need to go to the vet for this. If you are worried about infection you can go and they will give her antibiotics, clean it a little bit and charge you a lot. I work for a boarding kennel/groom shop and you would be shocked at how many pets loose toe nails and the dog/owner doesn't notice it. Personally my Jack Russell lost her toe nail when she was playing too hard with my moms lab. It bleed for about an hour, I was able to put some Qwik stop on it and then she was fine. Most dogs including her, do not mind when this happens. They would rather go on with what they were doing than have you looking at their feet. This is not comparable with losing a toe. It is just a nail. I know when I lost a finger nail I didn't rush to the doctors office. With time your pets nail will grow back and be normal. My jacks nail is already back to normal.(It happened about 4 months ago).
hdQvbs0naa	Well, I work in a pet store, and I was bitten pretty badly by one in the store. I was fairly new, and he had lived there for months and none of the other employees were interested in handling rats. I didn't know this, and I put my hand in the cage for him to sniff and CHOMP. He got me good on the knuckle. I was much more careful with him after that! And made sure to socialize all of the baby rats we've gotten in since.     The only time a pet rat has bitten my was my boy Templeton, but that was my silly fault. I'd fed him through the bars too many times, and I got my nose too close to them once and he bit my nose! He didn't bite it too hard though, once he realized it was a nose and not a treat! :P     Other than that I've never been bitten, not even when I'm doing something unpleasant like making them take their medicine. Rats are very friendly creatures, and biting is the last resort of a terrified or very uncomfortable (or sick) rat. Or, sometimes, if a rat's eyesight is poor and they don't have time to realize that you aren't giving them food they may get you as well.    I've bitten by many more hamsters than rats! :P|`|qUueClvXaa	because they don't have shared feelings with you?'  they dont even know it hurts you|`|7hAT9iLQaa	well i had a hamster bite me once when i was young. it was a new hamster, and i kinda flicked it in his mouth. i dont know if that cause him to learn not to bite or what, but he never bit again. i might have startled him.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	Rats are really wonderful, clean, intelligent pets.  We had some maybe ten years ago, and they were just adored.  One of them did bite my daughter, but she was having a slumber party and wanted to mess with the other girls with a rat, so, the rat bit, jumped, and ran.  Trauma for everyone involved!!!  I treated the bite with neosporin, had to have some one on one time to calm the rat, but all was well.  I bet the rat is licking the salt (sweat) off of you, or maybe you had the remnants of something tasty on your hands, and the rat wanted a sample.  But if the rat bites you, put him back in the cage, and start all over again introducing your hand in the cage, maybe pet a little, and work back up to picking him up.  Good Luck - I taught my rats to sit up and beg, and it was adorable!|`|JmD0oq2Naa	my rat koda bit me when i stuck my finger through the bars of his cage to stroke, i think he thought it was a treat. if i do it with my other rat he wont bite me, he just licks my finger|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Mine doesn't bite necessarily, but they do nibble.  Maybe smelling something on your hands and trying to see if it's edible by gently putting her teeth on you.  Every rat I've ever had has done this, but never have they taken a huge, painful chomp to me.  I wouldn't worry about it, rats are extremely good pets and very friendly.|`|cgm0vsdoaa	I have never really known rats to bite unless they were being poked and teased by cruel schoolchildren.  Sometimes if I stick my fingers through the bar they will start to bite, but quickly realize my finger is NOT a carrot or tasty treat and will stop.  They might start to bite if my hands smell like food also, or if theres something on them that they want to scrape off, like super glue or something.|`|gBYYMKhZaa	i have never been bitten by a rabbit apart from when i was Little and it was a really aggressive rabbit  most rabbits don't bite but they do nibble don't worry it doesn't hurt much anyway|`|C75EsUXRaa	Me myself NO never ever, a friend YES it was a horrible attack on her finger, when I saw the injury it made me wince she had him cornered in her hall when I arrived to help, I caught him and brought him back here, he was acting aggressively toward my other rats but not to me in fact he turned out to be a big soft wuss, I let him run around loose see how he would react and he came and sat with us on the sofas  SO I had him neutered, and he now lives with my 5 boys and is very happy & extremely tame and people friendly as to WHY he did what he did I'll never know,  and I am glad I gave him a chance he is 2 years old in may, and is a very charming gent. my friend was going to have him PTS.|`|ygN7vmqvaa	yes and it hurt like crap dude!!!!!!!!!!!!  he or she might not have very many fellings for you|`|GuOJIftAaa	The only time I've ever been bitten by one of my rats is when I was attempting to feed my largest male a french fry (just a small one) and he got so excited that he lunged and grabbed my finger instead. He let go instantly when he realized it was me he had gotten. It didn't hurt and didn't bleed. It was just an accident.    Some times they will give you a little test nibble you if you have a food smell on your hands. And some rats will groom you with their teeth, which is the highest rattie compliment besides boggling.|`|nVI0Stvzaa	My boys have bitten me, but they are rescues and they had a bad past from a neglectful owner. They were never properly socialized, so they're afraid of humans most of the time...I think they believe I'm going to hurt them and they need to defend themselves. If your rats weren't socialized correctly (sometimes rats from pet stores and animal shelters are not) they can get scared and bite out of self defense. I'm currently working with my boys to try to build up their trust. If you haven't had your rats for very long, they might not be used to you yet.    Like other people have said, if your hands smell like food or you put your fingers through the bars of their cage, they might mistake your finger for food and bite by accident. Always wash your hands before handling your rats to get any food smell off.    Another possibility could be aggression. If they have come out and attacked you (especially if they draw blood) and you don't know the reason, you might have a hormonal aggressive rat (this is rare). Neutering him will help. In my area, neutering costs about $150 per rat, so it's way out of my price range, but if that's the only thing that helps, it might be worth it.    If your rat bites you, it might be a good idea to get some thick work gloves (go to a hardware store, they're made of leather and pretty cheap) and wear them to handle the rat until you feel like there is enough mutual trust built up.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	they're trying to tell you that they aren't comfortable with you yet. you need to keep bribing with treats make them take it out of your hand & then after they're done eating it pet them. rats are some of the friendliest pets once they have your trust.|`|HOVVKiKmaa	Most rats who are tame will not bite a human aggressively. Mine have nibbled at my fingers if they smell food on them, which is why it is important to wash hands before handling them. Sometimes male rats with excessive levels of testosterone will bite, but these cases are rare, and if it does happen, it is best to have the rat neutered.

El gato es un animal carnvoro, y obviamente le gusta comer carne, sea sta de ratn, de gorrin, de pollo o de lo que sea. La comida para gatos tiene que tener un sabor agradable para ellos, y posiblemente les guste ms el pescado porque tiene un sabor ms intenso.|`|7e55f131856ad699673e29d348db26cfaa	Porque los gatos no comen ratones.

68e2f3981198ac74d4693a2aa7b7f5f6aa	Note: It is a common belief that 1 human year is equal to 7 dog years. That is not very accurate, since dogs reach adulthood within the first couple of years. The formula used above is from a canine expert and is a bit more accurate.

Aussie's are stockier, have broader heads and are without a tail.   Border Collie and Aussie coat colors are similar  (black and white, red and white, merles, tri-color, etc) The border Collie's naturally  carries it's head low while driving stock.

5145cb69221303ffa431a153f4082bd5aa	LOL, this is describing nearly all kitties.  They are sweet most of the time then they get this wild hair up the kazoo and go all nutz.  This really is a normal behavior for cats and the best you can do is to make sure breakables are secure when kitty decides to change personalities.      As for chewing paper, my cat does this so we make sure to put anything important away and spray Bitter Apple (pet stores carry it) to deter him from chewing.|`|549dc3975b99dfd9e3248c8b8e6423c8aa	Dig a hole.

Last night I got some hope. she jumped on my bed and stayed for a while and even rolled over playfully but it took her 5 times and I fell asleep about 4am, think she was still on the bed. How long have you had your cat? I hope mine calms down and yours as well but am going to contact the agency and see if there is anything i can do for her. good luck to you.

It is common for cats to go a little crazy and burn off energy, especially at dawn or dusk, which is when they normally hunt in the wild.  As long as he is not hurting anything, I would not worry.  If he seems genuinly anxious, ask your vet about anti-anxiety medicine (generic and inexpensive).  It may also be he has a lot of energy to burn.  Often getting a cat opposite sex and younger (best chance to get along) will give him someone to play with and burn off the extra energy|`|c3344063b6e86e7a5bedf26df98e62fcaa	Check to see if he is cross-eyed. Alot of cats are, esp Siamese. That tends to make them freak out.|`|6a6ba788657db4e8db6cbcc5b1683a3faa	This is normal feline behavior. Cats spend most of their day lounging around and sleeping-this builds up energy reserves. In the wild-they would use this energy to hunt-typically at night since they are naturally nocturnal. Since most modern cats live indoors and/or taken care of-they still have to have a way to expend their natural energy. If a cat is bored-it may do this to relieve that boredom as well.     I would suggest-if you see your kitty getting ready to spazz out on you-invite him/her to a rousing game of play-with a toy mouse, feather etc. I would certainly not scold or try to stop her.     I have cardboard boxes that I have set up into a "fortress", cat trees, scratching posts and various places I have set up for them to jump and sleep on.     Chewing paper-for that age is normal-cats will chew on anything their hearts desire. Advert their attention to other things such as toys and whatnot. My one cat used to suck on wool blankets, lick photographs and plastic bags. (Has to do with chemicals used in these materials)    I think it's sad your cat does not have it's claws.|`|5651405da826521d61456b8dbbbdd4a8aa	Well if you're anything like your avatar of Ms. Ratched (yeah it's spelled right) then you'll know why your cat is behaving the way it is.

XUVlamSMaa	There is a new product that I am going to try on my cats claws.  They are called Soft Claws or Soft Paws.  They have really good reviews, so I figure why not give it a try?      As far as introducing dogs and cats, I would give the new cat it's own room to be in that it can feel safe, where it's food and water and litter is.  Then if you have a kennel or crate for your dog, put the dog in the crate and let the kitty out to go and smell the dog.  At that point you can kind of judge by how the kitty reacts to how they are going to get along.  I just adopted two new kitties, one of them is totally fine with the dog....sniffed her, brushed up against her and now I leave them alone together even.  If you don't have a crate, put your dog on a leash and let the kitty come investigate.  Smelling each other is the first step....and getting them to accept each other's smell as part of the house.  :) |`|uqIXfXdHaa	   careful not to let the cat without defense by clipping his nails. You have to do it little by little, lock the dogs in a canal, you probably don't have one, but keep them separate by a gate for example so they can stay around each other without actually being obligated to be together, when you notice they won't get stressed anymore, next level. |`|fWkjEL9laa	you will need the 2 dogs on leashes, a helper, and lots of yummy treats. first have your helper hold the 2 dogs on their leashes while you hold the cat. when the dogs see the cat for the first time give them lots of treats so they associate the cat with good things, do this for about 2 weeks and gradually let the dogs and cat get closer together and during those 2 weeks never leave the dogs and the cat unsupervised, after the 2 weeks are up, the dogs should absolutely love having the cat around because they will see that it brings them treats. never leave your dogs and cat alone until you are absolutely sure that they will be okay together. hope this helps.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	the cat will take care of itself,, you need to control the dog
90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	There are only two species of alligators in the world. You won't be able to get ahold of a chinese alligator without a LOT of money. A foot a year on american alligators isn't quite right... it depends a lot on temperature range and feeding, and even in prime conditions how they keep them at the farms where they're growing them out for hides, they slow down drastically anywhere between three feet and six feet... a wild gator may NEVER hit a foot per year. I'm not getting into documented sizes... people like to say 15 feet... I'll let them if they don't want to do any real research.    SOME species of caiman stay "small" (again, comparatively), but they still have 80 teeth, and the reason they don't get as big as most other crocodilians is so that people can live in south america. (read: they've got a nasty attitude.)    As for the "in need of a good home" I urge anyone interested in it to be VERY aware of their state's laws concerning possession of crocodilians.|`|psqkf6rMaa	with a permite you can get on there may be a dwarf well its the smallest there is i think|`|qJtPcrWTaa	ya.

People think that they will stay small and then they end up getting too big....and then they eat the family dog, or end up abandoned and endanger the public.  Bad idea....|`|wbRjrV4baa	Small is a comparative term. A small alligator as you say is 6feet but compared to a large species of alligator that's small.    I know a few people with dwarf cayman as pets and even someone who has bred them but I don't think they ever become cuddly friendly pets you still need to count your fingers and toes after feeding time :-)|`|21de4e5a242c9e97450f4b1622925da2aa	No there are none.  All american alligators grow a foot a year until they reach about 15 feet.  They never lose their instincts so they can be released even if they were kept in captivity.  This person looking for a good home saw a little alligator and said aww how cute (and they are) let me take it home even if though I know nothing about alligators.

hSXrKT5qaa	definitely don't use pebbles. sand is good, or coconut fibre, or a mix of both, kept moist at "sand-castle" consistency. i know that's not what you asked, but i thought i'd throw that in there.  basically, between deep cleans, just scoop out any visible poops when you change their food and water, about once a day. spot cleaning the poops and stray food off of the substrate will keep mold and smelliness from getting out of hand. i know the little shovels look like those shovels for cat litter, but once the sand is properly moist it should NOT sift through. just scoop out the chunk of sand with the mess on it, and throw it out :) |`|zgPoGXizaa	you dont get a pooper scooper for crabs you change its sand/pebbles and fead them regularly soooo..........GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!|`|oREwz0A5aa	Hermit Crabs poop.

If it's a 10 gallon(the smallest tank size you should have), clean it once every 3 weeks.  You can try to clean out the crab's poop with the scooper; it's easier to just pick it out(once a day is good).  You should join the site crabstreetjournal.(can't post a link for some reason, just type it in), most members have a lot of experience with keeping them.  The articles are a good way to lean more about crab care.

Make sure you feed her well but do not over feed her as you will make the puppies to big and she will not be able to have them naturally you need to worm her so that the puppies don't get worms and flea treatment need so be up to date so when she has them the puppies are flea free also after whelping make sure that all the placentas have come out with the puppies if not watch her as some will reabsorb them but other can cause an infection i know this is all a bit to much as you don't even know if she has conceived yet  but all the best

AA10182106	Ok chances are it is not the mange. It sounds like a blown coat.  A very normal condition that occurs in Chi's and other breeds at about 8-12 weeks or after pregnancy and whelping is hair loss. Normally called by breeders as a "Blown Coat" It can look bad, but is only temparary. It might even look like a mite condition, ring worm or the mange. Most vets will initially diagnose it as such, as it would be the most obvious reason.     Females lose hair when they are recovering from pregnancy and the stress of whelping. Stress Can Cause Hair Loss.     Hair develops in cycles. Differant areas /patches of hair on the body will be in differnat stages of developement. New growth and fully matured follicles will be mixed around the body of the dog. This helps prevent a dog from going completely bald in any one area in a normal shedding process.    From beginning to end, once a hair stops growing, reaches maturity, it dies, but the follicle doesnt immediately lose the hair. It can stay put for weeks or even months, before coming out, depending on whats going on with your dog at the time. Thus the blown coat months after birthing a litter. From what I have seen you usually start to notace the extreme hair loss and shedding around the time of weening the pups..... 6-10 weeks later. Hope this info helped.  Scroll to Hair thinning and Hair loss on the following page on tips of how to avoid this in the future.|`|4e5091ebb829dd94409b7851f9629028aa	My dog had the same problem. When i took her to the vet they explained to me that she had demodectic mange. Every dog has this type of mange but some dogs have a lower tolerance to it. It is often brought out by a change in weather, stress, or a change in home. You can try a medicated shampoo from your local petstore but it would probably be best just to take her to the vet. She will be fine they will just give her some medicine.

PeQ40WcWaa	I'm sorry that the lady you bought your kitten from was not a very good person. Some people should not be allowed to have pets in my opinion.....    I am surprised that your vet didn't advise you to bring him in. It sounds VERY much like a urinary tract infection.     I've never had a cat with one, but ok here goes.... I've had one a few times and it makes you constantly need the toilet without being able to go, and blood can also be passed in the urine. When my cat was a kitten he would wee only once or twice a day, if this helps, so any more than this is worrying.    If left untreated, urinary tract infections can be extremely painful and actually incredibly dangerous. I'd take him in to the vet regardless of what they said - it won't clear up on it's own. In fact, take him to a different vet!    He will be ok I'm sure, but it does sound like an infection to me hun.    xx Emmie|`|9tyaBnAJaa	He needs to go to the vet NOW!  There should never be blood in a cat's urine.  And never give a cat (or kitten) cow's milk.  Most cats are lactose-intolerant and it will upset their stomachs and cause diarrhea.  If your cat is straining to go wee, he likely has a urinary-tract infection that can kill within one day.  Antibiotics can clear it up if it's caught early, but if there are stones or crystals, it may require flushing or surgery.  Good luck!|`|a0e3f4f78237ccff362798a941b4ab03aa	this is not something that can wait and im surprised your vet didnt say bring him in immediately!!! his urinary tract is obviously blocked and he needs to have it unblocked immediately or the urine will back up into his blood stream and he will die...please get him to the vet asap i had a cat almost die of this and i dont know why this little guy has one so early in life but take him in right now please!!!|`|HMIDNCr3aa	i think as well as him weeing alot his passing blood which aint a good sign id of thurt ya vet wud of took im in 4 tests its not a gud thing if your kitten is passing blood thru her urine id change ya vet 2 b honest and get a 2nd opion wot do the rest  of the readers think? all the best with him hope u get him sorted out|`|H31X1NIwaa	This maybe a kidney infection  as your vet said try and keep a eye on him and if you notice he is still passing blood then take him up the vets asap  good luck and i hope its nothing to serious|`|yUZmQKkOaa	Sounds like a blocked urinary tract which extremely painful and fatal within a very short time...not sure if it occurs in kittens though.

PutMbj2jaa	Kidney failure is one of the most common conditions affecting older cats. In most cases, chronic renal failure is progressive over time so that there is a gradual advancement and worsening of the disease. The rate of progression of the disease varies considerably between individuals. Appropriate support and treatment can both increase the quality of life of affected cats and prolong life by slowing down the progression of the disease. But this disease does progress slowly then the signs develop very suddenly.    It is most likely that your cat has been affected over time with then, yourself not noticing as it builds itself up, and then when notyicibly attacks it is probably most likely to late. I would be very surprised if a cat food caused this. Also, If you move an animal (espiacly to another country with having to go through coustoms and keeping your cat in quaratine) can cause major damage causing illness like this, cancer etc because of stress.     You should go and talk to your vet about this, and, if you do not like your vets opinion go to another one and just see what he/she says to get anotehr opinion. I think for your cats health, it is best that he is put down. An animal lover myself, I hate this to happen. But, it would be more painful and upsetting to see him go through what might be to come.

This is a natural occurrence in cats from the age of 12 upwards.    There is a specific "kidney diet" which you can put your cat on, but while it may extend its life for six months or even a couple of years, it really won't prevent the inevitable.    I had to let my cats go, and as devastating as it was at the time (and years later still is!), I know it was the right thing to do for them.  It's not right to let them suffer.    All the best with your cat.

V2KnXlLWaa	I have always thought labs have soulful eyes. Of course she doesn't want you to go but routine has taught her that you will. As for tearing things up, she is bored and probably not properly trained. My 5yr. old lab was trained as soon as we got her to only chew on her own toys. Everything else was off limits. Leaving her alone in the house has never been a problem. I think this is because she was left with toys that were her own and trained to use only those toys. I think another dog will only pick up her bad habits then you will have two dogs tearing up the house.|`|H4dPrrBsaa	Labs need a lot of exercise and if they do not receive the exercise that they need they can become bored and destructive.   A tired dog is a good dog.  She needs more exercise and a doggie proof place to stay while you are gone out.  Can you keep her in an area of your apartment while you are gone where there is nothing for her to destroy?  If not, you may want to consider crating her while you are out.  This will prevent her from destroying things and possibly hurting herself while you are not at home.|`|15159435e7798b1f72237e7c54732479aa	Yes, she needs more exercises and walk. I think don't put her to a kennel! In a kennel, she can't ruin things, but it's boring, so the walks will be harder for you.  Maybe she won't be bored if you buy a new dog but maybe they will ruin things together.|`|80bb87677d8929ca4ce706abcdf1b5d7aa	I think another dog would be a great idea. I have a pug and a beagle that keep each other company while I am gone.     Make sure you let your pet help pick out the new dog though, so you know that they will get along. My beagle went to the pet store and I let her go to every crate and pick out her new friend (after her sister got run over) she loves her new brother (even if I would have prefered another girl, cause now I have to watch them hump all the time).|`|AA12221025	i don't think she is lonely. i think it is just her normal face.|`|2ea288cb769a479f50ca022f4efd0988aa	hi hellraiser!      This is an easy one.  I think!  First, your dog must have a kennel so he cant ruin things or hurt himself while you're away.  Next, he simlply needs more exercise!  In the morning and in the evening you need to walk him.  Labs are good dogs but can be destructive if they are pent up and bored.

fgt44SSYaa	My cousin's cat is like that.   I've NEVER heard her purr and they haven't either, although if you as much as look in her direction and say something she meows. It's rather odd.  All cats are different. Some simply just don't purr.  Another possibility is that he was taken from his mother before they could bond. Purring is a signal from a mom to her kittens that they can start sucking, and a signal from the kittens to the mom that they're full.  It's not unusual at all that he doesn't purr, it doesn't exactly mean he's not happy, he just doesn't purr to show his affection.|`|XnXbPYd5aa	Some cats just don't purr.

Unless you give it to him already.|`|nxN8FEHxaa	my Cat Booger has a V8 engine he never stops purring and its really loud, he's also a very vocal cat (meows for attention, food and just because)    my other cat Vayder never purrs and i think that in his 3 years i've heard him meow once or twice. i was worried about it and asked my vet to take a look at him during a routine visit. turns out that Vayder is completely deaf. he tries to purr and he does the suckling motions (like booger when he's purring) when we're cuddling but no sound...    either way he just shows his love in other ways Booger is loud enough for the both of them.

Ten mucho cuidado porque cuando cambian de concha mucha gente piensa que se mueren, y no es as, ten cuidado y no lo vayas a tirar porque pienses que esta muerto. Tambin ponle una esponja con agua porque requieren de mucha humedad, son animales que viven en zonas clidas y hmedas. No lo vayas a dejar sin cubrir, ya que trepan lo que encuentran, no se te vaya a escapar. Tambin ten cuidado con tus manos, porque con sus pinzas meten tremendos pellizcos, y por instinto uno los suelta y los tira, y se puede morir de un golpe. Cuidalo mucho por favor!!!

Fc0ZR1hnaa	Thats the trouble with those Exer-Hides. Very addictive! I've got my dog so that she knows I will take it from her at any time. You have to get them to know who the boss is.

We see them in all the pet stores, the grocers, the feed stores. Everywhere. So we assume they are safe for our pets. They must be, they are sold everywhere. Right?    Think again.     Rawhide treats are a danger to your pets, and to your children if swallowed.     Rawhide is just exactly what it says, a raw dried out animal hide. This includes not only the rawhide bones & chews but also pig ears, pig snouts, bull tails, cow ears, lamb ears, choo-hooves, etc.  The vast majority of rawhide pet treats are not made in the United States. But even those marked Made in the U.S. are a hazard.     A piece of rawhide purchased as a treat for your pet is a hide, usually bull, cow or horse obtained from slaughter houses, that has been scraped clean of all vestiges of meat, fat and hair. Rawhide, however, can be made from just about any animal. For Native Americans and early Europeans, it was the sheet metal, nails and binding material of the day.  Rawhide was used to repair items such as horse gear and broken gunstocks. It was used in cabin construction as door hinges, windows and truss bindings and Mandan Indians used rawhide in the construction of their boats. As you can see, rawhide is a very strong, durable, heavy-duty item that does not easily break down    Still want to give it to your pets?    How is it made? Rawhide is made for commercial use from bull, cow and horsehides obtained from slaughterhouses as a byproduct of the meat industry.  The flesh side is scraped clean of all remaining meat, membrane, fat, etc. Traditionally this is done by hand, using a drawknife and scraper. Modern day tanneries use a form of a band saw to speed the process up and make a nice clean piece of leather. Commercial manufacturers of rawhide products have machinery to do this.  Once the flesh side is cleaned, the hair must be removed. There are two traditional ways of doing this. One is to dry scrape by hand. This is extremely time consuming, not to mention the amount of good ol fashioned elbow grease! Commercial makers of rawhide do not use this method.    The other method is to soak the fleshed hide in either an Ash-Lye solution or a Lime solution. The Ash-Lye involves covering or soaking the hide in a mixture of wood ash and water, which creates Lye. The hide soaks for approximately. 3 days in the Lye solution, then as much of the hair as possible is scraped off. The process is repeated until all hair is removed.      The Lime solution is the quickest and most often utilized by manufacturers. This utilizes ordinary builders powdered (hydrated) Lime. The hide soaks for 1-3 days and the hair is scraped off. This process is highly caustic but the most efficient for mass production.     To remove all traces of the Lime solution and to sanitize the rawhide product, commercial makers then rinse the hides in a bleach solution before creating whatever shape is to be used. The bone and other shapes used to attract you and your pet are created while the hide is still wet.  The treats are then either dried or sent for smoking to further entice the unsuspecting owner and pet. A processed rawhide can shrink up to half its original size when dried.    If the chemicals used to make these treats havent convinced you to stop, please consider this:    When rawhide is again wetted, usually when your pet salivates over this chew you have provided, it will slowly regain its original size. When your pet tears off and swallows a piece, that piece then has the potential to swell inside your dogs stomach. Your dogs gastric juices WILL NOT break down the rawhide. Once swollen, the piece then has the potential to cause anything from mild to severe gastric upset, to death.    Been giving rawhide treats for years with no problems?    My friend, you have been extremely lucky. But your luck WILL run out one day.     Are you certain that you want to gamble with your beloved friends life?    Dont believe me?    Take the rawhide challenge. Cut varying sizes from different rawhide products and set them in a bowl of water to soak before going to bed. In the morning you will see the sizes that they have grown to. They will vary, but the increase should be noticeable.|`|tvj22PSFaa	She is looking for it because it tastes so good. You want to limit how big and how much of a treat you give her.  You want to keep it below 25% of her normal food intake per day so she doesnt get overweight.  Daschounds have a lot of back problems so you might want to try fat free treats that you can get cheap like baby carrots, ice cubes, and since she is a baby and has baby teeth you should go buy her whats called a Chilly Bone.  It is made of really durable denim and you wet it and freeze it.  It is washable and can be reused.  They love it because it is cool and feels good on their gums and teeth.  Id let her finish the bone but try the nutritional treats when they are done.  My dogs love the chilly bones and they are about 4 ot 5 dollars at your locla pet store.|`|m9gS6UT7aa	give it back to her, it could be detremental to her psyche if you give her something and then take it away, your just confusing her, let her eat her bone, and if it keeps her occupied you should be happy.

AA12316360	Eat, snort, inhale, roll in, lick, pounce at, you name it, the cat is purrfectly safe doing it.  Some cats, though I have not met one, do not get the whole catnip thing and just look on it with mild distain, but the majority will try and ingest and roll in it like they were never going to get another dose again, go stupid for ten minutes then look on it with slight distain before licking a front paw and wandering off looking faintly ridiculous with bits of catnip stuck in their whiskers.

Catnip aids there digestion and can help prevent fur balls.  The only problem is, once they get a taste for it you won't have much catnip left for long|`|U2KXCatSaa	It's more than ok for your cat to eat catnip, it's great for their digestion and also helps to calm them down.  The initial reaction to catnip from the majority of cats is over excitement, this usually lasts around 15 minutes and your cat will then be thoroughly 'chilled out' after that.  The initial effects of catnip will only happen roughly ever hour or so, so presuming they've had their fix and there's no more around, your cat will be a calm and happy cat for a number of hours.  Big advocate of catnip here.

ePkiOzPSaa	Please don't go by what the pet stores tell you to accommodate your hermits.  There is a lot more to it than that.  You will want to check out     www.thecrabbagepatch.com/faq.html    and check out the boards on    www.crabstreetjournal.com    to post any questions you might have.  To get started, you will need to make sure that you have -    1) an appropriate way to heat your tank in the area of 78 F  2) two water bowls, one for fresh, distilled water, another for water with aquarium salt (not table salt)  3) fresh foods daily, with a staple hermit crab food as a supplement, hermit crabs avoid eating the same day after day, so they need variety, even if the hermit crab food you supply is nutritionally balanced, they won't always eat it  4) a thermometer/hygrometer to keep track of temperature/humidity  5) plenty of hidey spaces and climby things (coconut huts work well, as does driftwood, half logs, etc.)  6) substrate - something for your hermit crabs to walk around on and dig in (it should be deep enough that your biggest crab should be able to easily dig himself completely under it), I like to use eco earth, which is a coconut fiber based substrate  7) spare shells, and plenty of them!  You should have several shells available of the size that your hermits will need, as well as several slightly larger ones, for as they grow  8) friends! hermit crabs in the wild often live in colonies which can grow to greater than a hundred crabs!  the more crabs you have, the better (as long as you have room for them all), remember, several hermit crabs are generally as difficult to care for as one... if you can get a big enough tank, this also means you won't have to go through the incredible stress of having all your crabs digging under and molting at once, but it's always best to have at least 2+ hermits.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	http://www.hermit-crabs.com/    No comment :o)|`|5CtCgbENaa	Pet stores have kits that include all you need.

fFtBqFB6aa	something serious did happen; it bit another dog.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Aggression without warning, or with warning? That growl and dramatic snap have everything to do with warning. Since your son didnt get the message during the growl, the dog just told him more noticably.   The dog shows warning signs he is unhappy. You have to listen to that.    He growls and dramatically snaps, basically everything to get the owners and people to realize it isnt happy and is getting ready to bite.     This is an innocent dog getting put down for stupid dog owners. Yes that includes your rant seeking reassurance of calling AC. No you should not. Yes the owner was rude, but that did not give you the right to just let your dog go up to the dog showing warning signs. Thats stupid and horrible leadership. Thats like letting your kid cross the street even if a car is flying down the street.     Learn dog behavior: www.flyingdogpress.com    No person should try and pet a growling dog.   Where was the adult?    Your Idea you didnt do anything wrong prevents you from ever learning if you did. You knew that dog wasnt right, you knew and yet you still let your dog go say hi and that is when the arguement started. If you knew before your dog went, why did you not grab your dog and walk away?   That is the problem with dog owners, they all thing my dog is innocent and would never start a fight. It doesnt matter who started it, if you could've prevented it by putting your dog on a leash and walked away. That is your job as a leader.   Start learning just like the rest of us. Especially if you post a question.   This is not a place to rant, you ask questions here. If you are upset about it, go ask a person experienced in dog behavior. Dont go seeking reassurance, go with an open mind that both you and him might have been wrong.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	letting them of the leash is ok but you must have control and if the dog bit another dog how long before a child is bitten report dog and owner to animal control|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	Report the dog to animal control.|`|e6wo7czgaa	I would notify now. So that when something bigger does happen ( which I certainly hope not) they at least have some report of behaviour problems.|`|L4BFp2mNaa	I would contact animal control. Where I live aggressive dogs that have bitten people or other animals in the past are often euthanized to remedy the problem. If that does not work go to the police to see about charges against the owner of the dog.|`|AcxGPyG5aa	I would be reporting it to the to Animal Control. It is very dangerous dog.  Or else I would require that they get a protective biting device to put over the dogs muzzle.They as the owner could be already in trouble with the dog they was already bitten.|`|vnF9GipDaa	I would say something to the owner first, they may be unaware of decent behavior. Sad, but there are a lot of people out there who don't socialize them, because they think it means their dog won't be protective. I have Labs, and the only time they are aggressive is if someone comes up to me in a menacing way. Otherwise, they will lick your face off!|`|ldmSmaKqaa	there is a three strike law on dogs that bite please don't wait for it to keep happening the next time could be fatal you can stop it faster by reporting it than keeping your mouth shut ok|`|8WxwwDR1aa	you are not being harsh you are right if this dog has attacked another dog and tried to bite a young child it should at least be wearing a muzzle i think you should ring the local animal control.

That kid needs to learn some manners, likewise the dog does too.    I didn't read your previous question-- so I don't know the circumstances, but from what I'm reading here, if the dog was comfortable enough to get close to the kid to smell him, he's not dangerous, nor aggressive, but probably improperly socialized, and skittish.    EDIT:  Ok I saw your other question-- and you most certainly are at fault for what happened between you two.  You were in a public area, where almost undoubtedly the LAW is to have your dog on a leash, and your dog was running free.  IF your dog had been on a leash, this whole scenario would never have happened.  And you can't base your opinions on what others told you-- what happens to others-- unless you saw it-- has absolutely nothing to do with you, especially because you don't know if the story is true or not.|`|p7swtBYzaa	The neighbor whose son was almost bitten and the owner of the dog that was bitten have the option of calling Animal Services - if this is true.  You seem to be looking very hard to label this dog as dangerous - are you sure you are reporting facts, not just rumors you like to hear?    From your first question, it was not clear as to whether or not your dogs should have been running lose, the other dog you label as vicious was on leash.   Your dogs should not be allowed to run up to a strange dog and get in his face - this is rude and confrontational in dog language - you need to restrain your dogs and you know it.  No dog will allow another dog to run up to him and stare him down or confront him, that's just not how dogs greet each other.    I would advise you to take your dogs for obedience classes to learn to control them and help socialize them properly.    If this dog you speak of is such a menace, he should be reported by the people who have had themselves, their kids, or their dogs menaced, not by you because you were offended by the dog's owner when he told you to mind your own business - and your own dogs.    You are not telling facts here - you are looking for an excuse to do harm to someone's dog.   That's not something you have a right to do.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I would probably keep my distance from the dog, and maybe try to talk to the owner about proper ways to contain the dog and protect other people and dogs from him.  If the owner is irresponsible, I would call the animal officers.
KdR1Lx3yaa	IF U LOVE UR DOG THAT MUCH WOULD NT U WANNA KEEP HIM/HER AT HOME TILL THE END??? I HAVE A PROB WITH PUTTIN ANY ANIMAL DOWN IF THEY DONT HAVE TO......  You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend. Whenever I was "bad," you'd shake your finger at me and ask, "How could you?" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a belly rub.    My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together. I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not be any more perfect.    We went for long walks and runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because "ice cream is bad for dogs" you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.    Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently, comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.    She, now your wife, is not a "dog person" -- still I welcomed her into our home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy. Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate.    Oh, how I wanted to love them, but I became a "prisoner of love." As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.    There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories about me. These past few years, you just answered "yes" and changed the subject. I had gone from being "your dog" to "just a dog," and you resented every expenditure on my behalf. Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've made the right decision for your "family," but there was a time when I was your only family.    I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled out the paperwork and said, "I know you will find a good home for her." They shrugged and gave you a pained look. T hey understand the realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with "papers." You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar, as he screamed, "No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.    You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked, "How could you?"    They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago. At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad dream... or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me. When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited.    I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room. A blissfully quiet room. She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days. As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood. She gently placed a tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran down her cheek. I licked her hand in the same way I used to comfort you so many years ago. She expertly slid the hypodermic needle into my vein. As I felt the stin|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	That question made my blood boil!     I don't understand how people can be irresponsible parents and pet owners to the point that they don't think they should teach their children that pets are not their for them to pinch twist and pull at.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	She obviously has a hard time understanding the term "responsibility".     When you have small children you have to beware of them handling any pet. Pet's will bite and defend themselves when they feel threatened. They aren't going to psychoanalyze if the person is too young to know better.     But, these are usually the same types that will just get a cat or dog and be absolutely shocked that it takes some time and effort to have a dog or cat.|`|sgcrB6x0aa	prometheus, you are making me cry.    I think I am going to appoint a next owner of my dogs just in case something unexpected happens to me.|`|dBWz9Lidaa	You mean she put the puppy down just for biting a kid? *gasp*!   That is absolutely INSANE! You can train puppies and the kid was probably just teasing it! I can't believe some people!

TYohMrlXaa	If i had a tank that big, I would do the same thing. I love my Orandas, they are defiantly interesting looking. :) Your goldfish will get so large and healthy that no one would dare call them boring!|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Ive never been much on goldfish. I do like orandas however... But other than that, I would probably do about two comets in that tank.    Youd be surprised. If youve ever kept any large cichlid, you would understand why people are questioning your fish choice. Ive got some 3-4 inch Jack Dempseys and they already run to the front of the tank to beg for food.    Cichlids in general are smarter than other fish. Most cichlids have some pretty hilarious personalities. Ive only seen a few private goldfish tanks, and they dont really even acknowledge you. Larger cichlids will actually come to the front of the glass just to be nosy.    Most fancy goldfish wont grow much over 8 inches, depending on the type. But goldfish normally dont have the personality of cichlids. So a 10 inch goldfish would be pretty boring when compared to a 10 inch oscar.    Just because there are variations in a fishes boy color, doesnt give it any credit in it being interesting. Id rather have a plain fish with personality than a colorful fish without it. If you compare the fancy goldfish variations to even on group of cichlids, the fancies seem to not even have any variation.     Obviously, I dont care for goldfish. They are, in my opinion, one of the most boring types of fish. But they get mistreated the most often. So the fact that you are actually doing this right, I respect you.|`|X4hz3a9haa	I agree with you about keeping just goldfish, they are less hassle than a lot of these tropical fish, and they give as much pleasure at a fraction of the cost, LONG LIVE GOLDFISH|`|IrdZKYT3aa	I would personally fill that thing with tropical community, but every ones got their own preferences for fish and their own reasons.  I luv guppies b/c of their colors and the ease of having fry.  An Oscar is more interactive, goldfish just seem sort of...meh.  Boring, slow moving, dirty fish.  I think their waste production and the amount of space they need gives them a pretty bad rap.  Plus, even though I know they come in many colors and what not, I tend to associate them as the cheap prize you get at a carnival.  But if they make you happy, it's your tank!  Clearly you luv them as you're providing them a fantastic home!  Enjoy!|`|Jguzosm2aa	I wouldn't, if I only had the one tank. I adore goldfish, but with something so large to work with, I'd crave the more extensive variety of a tropical tank. However, I don't see anything wrong with the idea.

The odd thing is, if you had a 500-gallon pond, probably no one would think you were strange for keeping just goldfish in it.    We all have our favorite fishes (I like cichlids and "oddballs"), but in fact I think fancy goldfish are quite attractive and interesting, although I don't have any of them. Follow your heart, and keep whatever kind of fish excite you.

I've seen some very nice goldfish and they make for a very colorful tank.  I don't prefer cichlids that hide in caves all day and you never seen them, either.  What's the point in keeping fish you never see and hide from you?    I do not have goldfish myself but I see nothing wrong with having the fish you prefer.  I have to say I commend you on keeping your goldies in a nice big tank.  This is a rarity, especially on yahoo, where so many cram them into 10 or 20 gallon tanks.  Nice job.    Enjoy your goldfish.|`|QV6swGUMaa	i would make it into a tropical or salt water tank for defo you could have such a great tank.but ya could put some koi in it either.personal taste really so it is.gold fish do create more dirt.good luck with what ever choice ya make :)|`|OsVswissaa	I love fancy goldies, for a socialable fish with lots of personality they can't be beat.
AM7CgQ4daa	my GSD is two years now, and has really improved with her fear of water.   We got a children's wading pool and only pit a couple of inches in the bottom, then I jumped in and started jumping up and down going splash, splash.  You need to sound happy, run around the jump back in.  If you have a friends dog that likes water it can help to bring the over.  Our dog soon jumped in and joined us.  Next take the dog to the river with another dog and a ball, again it is a matter of just standing in the water, then going a little deeper, our dog soon swam after the other dog.   Today she is not really scared of water, but if there is not another dog she tends not to go deep, but at least she is not scared anymore.|`|wX5xoAN8aa	I have a German Shepherd mix as well, and she equally hates water. Just like yours, she behaves when it's bath time, but as soon as she can, she's out of there.

I guess if they don't like it, they just don't like it.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	i have a pitbull/beagle ( I know ) He hates water.  He's never had a traumatic experience with it and has been swimming in lakes with us since he was a puppy.  He always ends up shivering and terrified sitting on my raft!  Bath time comes around and tail goes between his legs and he just melts and tries to blend in with the floor.  He too behaves and I give him treats in the tub but to him its cruel and unusual punishment. I leave him be when we go swimming and he will walk out in the water but no further than his chest.  I would suggest just leaving him be if you can.  I have to keep mine on a long lead because of behavioral problems but if you give him the freedom to step in one toe at a time it may help him enjoy it on his own terms.|`|KxjUim7yaa	The only thing I can think of is a small child's wading pool.

I have Scotties and they are aggressive chewers. I found that any chew toy that was "size appropriate" was a goner. I ended up getting the black Kong in the size appropriate for a German Shepard and he did great with it; he still uses it. The larger size heavy chewer Nylabone toys may also last a little while. I've seen some toys that are made from the tough fabric that luggage is made from as well. These look rugged.    Have you tried something big that she can't get her mouth around, maybe a soccer ball that she could chase. With an aggressive chewer, you will need to supervise her with her toys. Hopefully you can get some suggestions here that will let you find a toy or two that will last longer than a couple of days. I hunted for some sites with tough toys. I can only vouch for www.dog.com it is a good site with good prices.    I've read your edits: Make sure you get the black kong. It was designed for training police dogs. You may be happy with this one! Good luck. I know what it is like. I've seen mine shred a $12-$15 toy in 10 minutes. Expensive fun!|`|80S8U7Edaa	These are thick and really great:    http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p246/leo-ex...|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Orbees are pretty darn tough.

They are for sale at places like dog.com    EDIT: This gives some info about a few: http://www.caninecrib.com/dog/articles/d...    You can try giving her biodegraable items to chew apart like dog-friendly squash and carrots.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	a kong toy|`|LLlsbF48aa	The Kong is king!

Kong does make a durable toy that is for "power chewers" -- that might work for you.  I know you say you tried Kong, but there are different levels, so maybe try the "power chewer" one to see if it will work.    Also, the large, heavy bones they sell (cow bones, etc.) might be something that will take her a while to get through.   Nylabone has a bone they say is for power chewers, but if I get the "appropriate" recommended small dog size, my dog gets thru them pretty quickly.  He's a dachshund mix (think with Jack Russell) and he's a chewer too.  What I do, is I get the "power chewer" bone, but I get it for a LARGE dog rather than a small dog.  Even though he (my dog) will eventually get through it, it takes him much, much longer than if I get the bone that's recommended for his size.    **ADD**  Boy, it sounds like your dog and my dog are siblings!   My dog is little - about 15 lbs -- and he chews thru everything too.  Try getting the Nylabone (or similar brand) bone that is for power chewers -- but get the larger dog size, not the one recommended for her size.  Also, if you decide to try the cow bones (or other "real" bones) they sell at the pet store, be sure to get the larger dog size not the one recommended for her size....that way it will take her longer to get through it (hopefully).    You gotta be careful with rawhides, especially if you're giving it to the dog often.  The rawhide doesn't break down in a dog's stomach like regular food and the pieces can swell in the stomach and cause obstruction issues in the intestines.|`|PdotFx4naa	Well, unfortunately you just have to keep getting her new toys.  My dogs destroy every toy they get within a day or two.  It keeps them busy.

Even if your dog chews it, you get replacements for it for free. Although if your dog manages to chew it up, the company may want to figure out how to prevent that so they may contact you.     There is a toy made out of bulletproof plastic, but I can not remember what it was.     As a jack, she should be getting tons of exercise, try to take her bike running, hiking, skateboarding(there was a jack that would skateboard until it got ahold of a poisonous frog), etc. And all toys not being used should be put away for your to dish out when it is time.    Try antlers. Go to red bandana if you have on around you, if not, look for a boutique that has them. Only thing is they are highly priced due to processing. My dogs have had one for two years.|`|AA10441482	WHAT KIND OF KONG DID YOU BUY HER??? Did you purchase the correct chewing capacity, the black ones are for stronger chewers, also the kong wubba has a couple layers they have to get through to destroy the toy.    I have 3 boy Jack Russells that are the same way, rope toys, the toys made out of tire materials, and I found this toy at petsmart that was an animal round a harder tennis ball, those are the toys that took the longest for them to destroy.     You can also teach her how to play with the toys, if you don't let her destroy toys and show her to play fetch or make them squeak and just monitor her playing that should help as well.        Update: The pink kongs are normally for puppies, it doesn't matter how big it is, it matters the strength of the material it is made out of, pink and blue are for puppies, red is for normal chewers and black is for power chewers. Try a black Kong.    Second update: I was looking online and there are toys called Zanies they look like they would last also there are pink and blue toys called my little prince or my little princess they last and the dogs love them, can't destroy them!!|`|AA10726599	I have a silky terrier mix that chews also. He will not play with any toys but the soft, stuffed ones. He has some he leaves whole and plays with and he has some he destroys within a day.

We have quite a variety of empty and full toys. They are funny critters aren't they?

They are sold at most sporting goods/ hunting stores.|`|nHz1byGsaa	My dog's the same so we got him a toy called "Rags". It's basically a big knot of rope and string and is (so far) indestructible. You can get them from most pet stores and toy stores. I recommend trying one - they're pretty cheap and she probably wont be able to rip it apart. Hope this helps!
UyAGXNCsaa	I would do it, but not with kids in the house.  Not necessarily because of the breed, personally I have no problem with either breed, but because it's confusing to the child.  When you have a dog in the house with young children (we have a 3 1/2 year-old son), the child can really get attached (and you may too).  I think fostering is a wonderful thing, but I'd wait until the child is older - perhaps 10 or so.  Just my opinion.|`|9LTRmLi4aa	Yes I would take the dog in. As far as Im concerned a homeless dog is a homeless dog. Its difficult for a puppy to adapt to the shelter life. Try as they might the shelter workers don't have enough time to socialize the puppy. All dog need time to adjust into any ones home.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	yes i would do it|`|xy4enYFyaa	I would take the dog in.|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	Try to find a no kill shelter for him to stay in, you can also search on this wonderful internet that you have for breed rescues in your area.|`|FdcWPp48aa	If I had room I would take the dog.  I have a Rottweiler, so no breed bias's here!|`|IEVwBt24aa	take the poor dog :/|`|6PLnd0SDaa	you can always take the dog. i would.   but i you might become aached and not want to give him up.|`|4SQx8smEaa	I would take the pup in.|`|9fdyfwO4aa	it would depend on the history/disposition of the dog.  If its never been around children I'd say no.  And if I didn't have experience w/dogs then no.|`|AA10500537	try finding someone else to take the pup but if you cant  try it out but be very careful with the children|`|7c1NblyYaa	well..pitbulls are very good dogs if their raised right, actually one of the best to have around children. But since the dog has been aggresive before I don't really know. It's better that it is a young dog so that way it has time to learn and also it isn't in its own state of mind to where you can't tell it yes and no..so thats kind of good..but i dont know. I am just giving you some details because I think that you should chose with your family whether it would be a good idea or not. But I hope I helped atleast a little and Good luck!!!  :)|`|ZaPFztGJaa	I have children and I have owned a rottweiler. They are actually very good with kids. I would just consider it as I would any other mix breed coming from the shelter. Of course there are risks but no different from the risks involved with any other mix breed, previously owned, shelter dog. Do you know the circumstances for it's being at the shelter?|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	I would have to see how the dog reacted and keep a close on the dog and my children. I would if needed so that the dog was not put to sleep take the dog in while we searched hard for another home that may be more suitable for him. I would def not suggest sending him to another shelter. or kill him.|`|jQglJiMhaa	I would take him in, but make sure that my kids are educated on how to behave with a dog around, and make sure i keep my eyes on the dog to catch any poor behavior in order to nip it in the butt for the future adoptive family|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I'm not really general public, so I'd go an evaluate the dog myself.  If he seemed fine, I'd bring him home.  If not, I'd suggest euthanasia.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Have you been around the dog? Please don't judge the breed, judge the dog.    Oh course, you should always supervise interactions between dogs and kids.  I hope you can do it.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	I have done a lot of fostering over the years, and I would never take an animal that was not appropriate to have around my kids. My girls are teenagers now, so know a lot about dogs and can help me, and not put themselves at risk, but when they were smaller I did more puppies and kittens than full grown dogs.  Fostering can be easy or hard, depending on which animals U choose to take in. Dog crates and outside kennels are a must, if U take in bigger dogs and whole litters of pups. A lot depends on an individuals dog's personality -- but my advice is to err on the side of caution, and play it safe -- U can't replace a child that is killed by a crazy dog. It always boggles my mind when people allow their children to play near female dogs in heat, and there is a male dog nearby. These people should not be allowed to have pets or kids. Enough said.|`|Eo4PngmAaa	take him b/c if u were a dog would u want him to die he's probrobly thinking about u right now!!! make sure u choose the right thing!!  hope i helped!!!!!!!!!|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Its not the breed. Ask the shelter, where he came from. If the dog came from an abusive, neglectful, situation, he could have devoloped some psychological issues, and probably wouldnt be best in a home with children. Normally if a small child touches a new dog the wrong way, or tries to be rough with the dog, the dog might not tolerate it, and your child could be risk.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I would take the dog in. Dog breeds aren't the problem. Dog OWNERS are.|`|vfXOWjXxaa	in my opinion i would take the dog i think it would be good to save the dog|`|5IcNNkkuaa	Take the dog in. Pit-bulls are great with kids, they were bred to be extremely loyal and human friendly. Also, as long as they are properly socialized and trained, they do well with other people and animals alike.    They get a bad reputation, however it is entirely not true.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Would depend on: how old the kids are, how much time you have for training, what his background is (any aggression)
e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Tell the skunk that your cat wants a serious relationship with LOTS of babby kitties.    If he's like any other male, he'll run like hell.

I hear ESPN is good.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I had a real skunk mating with my Siamese female a few years back. That little hussy would escape from my house when she came into heat (I wanted to breed her to someone's Siamese cat) and would mate with a different cat each time, the third time it was a skunk, of course no kittens but she sure did stink a couple days. She didn't get flowers or candy either, she would just give it away to a the first new one to mate with her.|`|jBKiD5ugaa	I have almost the same problem, but its a drunken hillbilly skunk!|`|09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	Trap and relocate the skunk beyond a body of water, works and do it ASAP|`|lVHBqDJEaa	It might be too late.

rrLHU6ehaa	No.  The fry are too small to eat the eggs.  Any unhatched eggs can be considered infertile and will likely fungus.  These should be removed immediately.  Or you can put snails, cory cats, or kuhlii loaches in the tank and let them eat the eggs.|`|D2sMKkchaa	Not too sure but if you feel that your zeb' dia' will then separate the eggs from the mom-fish oh no,you wouldn't be able to do that.Separate the mom from the eggs.
IrdZKYT3aa	As long as they are thoroughly cleaned, yes.  I suggest boiling, this is a sure fire way to clean them.  Best of Luck!|`|UbSJPBuNaa	just clean them as best as you can without soap and make sure they are not jagged or sharp|`|AA12159454	Depending on what was on the rocks before, if there was some really nasty stuff on them make sure to clean it very well but if it looks fine i don't think you will really have a problem.|`|tTsMMhCaaa	Yes, I do this with my fish. You should first clean them thoroughly in cold water and a dish towel. You should then boil them, to get the excess germs and bacteria off them. Wait until the rocks cool off and are dry. You are then able to put them in your fish tank!
gJlxZdL5aa	Scottish Terrier    (Though my husband says Minature Schnauzer he had one growing up)|`|syT3XUAraa	Mini Schnauzer. My cousin has one and she's really sweet. I like the Scottish Terrier, too, though.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Miniature Schnauzer. I do NOT care for Giant Schnauzers, so size does matter for me.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Well scottish terrier because i own one. But in the future I would definitely get any type of schnauzer and of course another scottie.|`|AA10229248	Scottie!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	SCOTTIE always!!!   far better terrier than schnauzer!!|`|vPde97E2aa	Thank who-ever those are NOT only choices!    BUT........there are MILLIONS of miniature schnauzers(every Tom Dick & Mary cranking out crap) so the level of QUALITY is FAR below that of the Scotty.    The Standard can be a lovely beast.   The Giant does NOT appeal to me in the slightest.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Miniature schnauzer|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Of the two, I pick the scottie.|`|fLlBd5aCaa	Scottish terrier because thier bigger.|`|pipNCxybaa	If any schnauzer then...    giant schnauzer instead of a terrier    BUT    i would rather have a terrier than a mini
w1lh1INHaa	In order to make plastic bags biodegradable they are made out of animal fats and starch.  Yum!    (Hint:  Don't leave them lying around where the cat can get to them.)|`|OTxCCXa5aa	I've never experienced a cat doing this before. How odd!|`|n7bok7NRaa	Many cats suffer from a malady called "Pica" - a need to eat things that are non-nutritious and inorganic. My cat, for example loves to eat cardboard, books, paper and anything similar. But I also had a cat with your issue who constantly chewed on plastic bags.    While it might seem funny, or even slightly annoying (because of the noise), it can be VERY dangerous, especially with plastic bags. Make sure you keep your house free of plastic bags that the cat can chew on, because it may easily get tied up in one or swallow a great deal of plastic which will hurt their digestion.|`|FkhFIIsjaa	That is why I stopped stuffing my pillow case with plastic bags... darn cats!|`|CGxnLNWOaa	YOU ARE LUCKY, MY CATS PEE ON!|`|M7IPomHqaa	i'm not sure why cats lick plastic but i have a cat that does that and wondered why?|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	How funny that you ask this - there is a cat on my desk licking plastic right now!    Plastic grocery bags are laced with a substance that makes it easier to separate them - this substance is fairly sweet and cats seem to like it.|`|1l04qpOKaa	My cat has a plastic fettish too. He chews on it but I don't think he eats it. It can make a cat very sick really quick if they do eat it. I try not to leave any laying around where he can get to it. Kepp all your plastic bags in 1 drawer or cabinet away from kitty  :o)
igrMkjU2aa	i find this extremely cruel. I could never bring myself to even harm a helpless puppy let alone two of them cute or not. If a human being is capable of dong such a horrifying thing to animals and not care they could do the same to people. Animals that are being abused have no say in who they are adopted by or how their quality of life is. We should at least give them what they deserve.|`|qpS8Kbzxaa	whats wrong with having a hot dog roast. they should have had wiener dogs.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	This has been posted several times. Do the authorities know which kids are guilty? I am still unclear about if the little demons are caught.  Sadly nothing will be done. Each needs counseling!   IMHO the evil monsters should be sentenced to work at a kill shelter, make them witness the euthanasia and then, have them dig a 6 foot hole for each deceased animal.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Yes it is sad. There are many sick people in this world. Karma will come back for them. Hopefully they will be in alot of trouble for this.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	Sooo sad!  If you don't like animals then don't get them!  What don't they understand?|`|fMRcX2WDaa	that is wrong and sad!! why are these kids unattended? to where they are able to do this stuff. where are the parents they should be removed from there homes, and put into foster care. before they get worse. they say kids that do stuff like this end up being murders and rapist.|`|l5kWF8m3aa	oh wow, how dreadful. What kind of parents raise kids like that? Disgusting.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	those children should have been tossed off of a bridge!
EHBX1F54aa	Your bird is still in toddler stage.  I wouldn't put any more expectations on his speech capacity right now than I would on a human toddler.    I have a Congo AG, Bella, and she picked up a few words before she was two.  Now she's four, and her vocabulary is amazing.  I'd say she learned most of her words between two and three.    One thing I've noticed is that Bella usually picks up words and phrases that I say with excitement and/or emphasis (stuff like "Hi, sweetie!" and "Poof!" and "Uh-oh").  The more oomph you put on your words, the more apt your bird is to take interest.    Good luck!  Aren't AGs just wonderful?|`|PPBP6AGDaa	My African Grey is 18 months and he only says 'Hello' and 'Meow' and quite a few interesting whistle tunes. I don't mind however/whenever he decides or doesn't decide to try more vocalizations, but keep in mind that every bird is different.|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	They can start to speak at any age but they have there own pesonaliteys so some dont like to speak.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	He's still young, so give him time. My Grey started talking earlier, but that's because my Macaw taught her. does he whistle yet? Many birds prefer that to talking when they are young. What I found, is that mine pick up things that I say to other people more than what I say to her. Does he make any sounds at all?   Are you sure he doesn't talk when you are not around? Mine actually does most of her talking when I'm in another room (but in hearing distance).  Be patient, I'm sure he'll talk more in time.
JGq9rKBOaa	I'd recommend purchasing a "Kritter Keeper" or other small animal carrier. It's sturdier than the cardboard boxes given out when you buy animals at the pet store, which can be chewed through pretty easily. Also, it's good to have a reusable carrier around. You can put the hamster in it when you clean its cage, and should you need to take the hamster to the vet or somewhere else by car, you'll definitely need one.     I think a medium sized Kritter Keeper is only about 10 dollars.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	Most- if not all pet shops- will give you a suitable box.|`|mXEOcSeuaa	So long as you cut holes in the top for air it should be just fine. =)|`|RkbMSKu5aa	the pet store usually gives you a small cardboard box, but if you want to use something else, you could use one of those small, hard plastic animal carriers.they sell them at the pet store and they come with colored tops and have a handle on top to carry it.  good luck!|`|ZtMUZ6ryaa	yes a shoebox is good as long as you hold the lid on tight but when i got all my hamsters they put them in a box for you to take her home in good luck|`|1RGsWodYaa	Most stores will give you a box to carry him home in. As long as it is not a long ride you will be fine. If you have a long ride use a small carrying cage that you can purchase for about 5 dollars, this will also come in handy when you need to clean the cage. I bought a hamster and decided to run a errand on the way home and he chewed through the box in less than 30 minutes.|`|KhL4tauTaa	when i got my hamster from a pet shop they put it in a smaller box to a shoe box. so ye its ok but the shop will most likely give you a box to take it home in.
EJpiaCMQaa	I know what you mean.  All birds are beautiful.  One of my favorites is the flamingo.  I love their coloring and their long necks and legs.  They are so pretty.  Penguins are another favorite.  They are so adorable and I enjoy watching them waddle.  Thank God for birds!|`|jvYPiZYIaa	mine is a blue t.i.t and a great t.i.t|`|UvPUopA8aa	Any bird of paradise,Tanagers,Honeycreepers,Peacocks & Hummingbirds.|`|bseGACNXaa	I would have to say English Sparrows.  We have two that we rescued when they fell from stable arena rafters.  They are so friendly like little people.|`|pspRQ9KAaa	My greenwing macaw: Sonnenbar.|`|fYNZPHlgaa	Cocatiels!|`|x5HMQgQyaa	Wild Birds: Corvids (Crows, Mapies, Ravens, etc) and raptors    Pet Birds: Pionus, hands down.|`|PPBP6AGDaa	African Greys! I adore them.|`|p3aC2oe2aa	My favorites are Black Swans, I also really like Wild Ducks and Magpies|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I recently moved to an area where there are a lot of quail, and I've just fallen in love with them.  They have a chicken-like quality in the way they walk and roost, but their coos and tweets are just adorable, and they are so family-oriented.
AoSeHXeQaa	I have had several battles with determined escape artists (right now I have a rescue that I have named Cool Hand Luke :o)).      The final solution for the most stubborn ones has been an electric wire along the fence (at the bottom for diggers, and at the top for jumpers.)  You can buy the transformer, wire and connectors at a pet store...you plug the transformer in, and it lowers the household electric current to a point where it will discourage, but not damage the dog.  Then you just run the wire where you need it.  Even the most stubborn dog will only need to hit it once or twice before rethinking his escape plans.    I suspect escapism is tied to dominance- I have never had a submissive dog try to get out of the yard.  I think a really dominant dog believes he owns the world, and needs to get out to inspect his possessions. :o)    From what you say about your walks, it sounds like your dog does not respect you as a leader. So... if I were you, I would also work on establishing dominance.  That will allow you to give the dog more exercise, and it may help with the escaping, too|`|gwUMipsUaa	This is why I'm against letting dogs outside, unless the owner is outside with them.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	well for one is she spayed? if not get it done asap this could be your problem. also you can try dog training it will help teach you how to train her as well. as teaching you to bond with her. if you don't bond properly she will not be obedient and run off on you. i don't believe in invisible fences i think they are inhumane and cruel. i have two very large dogs no fenced in yard and they do not run off they know there boundaries and are very loyal and obedient.|`|PdotFx4naa	Dogs are fine on chains.  She will stop pulling when it hurts her.  I have to use a choke chain for my dog too.  She climbs over my chain link fence.  I got a tie out, where the dog can run the length of the yard while still being hooked up.  This way she is not confined to a small area.  This helped a lot more than just having an 8 foot area to run.  Try that, they have these tie outs at wal-mart for like $20.|`|nYv65TlEaa	My dogs are never let outside un-attended,but you could get that invisible fense the other poster said,works great and before you know it,dog won't try and escape,I still find htat funny,One of my dam,has had 2 liter,3 in each,and both second born escaped from the whelping box,and its about 8 inches high and a wee  less then 2 lb Maltese have escaped,i called those both escape artist,lol,I have the second litter still 5 weeks old and almost fully weened off mom,they been using pee pads since 3.5 weeks old    ok I know nothing to do with your question,sorry,I get carried away|`|zSOnXtiQaa	Does she get enough exercise? Dogs that aren't walked regularly or have any stimulation often become disruptive. Try taking her out one day until she is dead tired, fetching or walking, whatever it takes. When you bring her home and you know shes tired, see if she still tries to escape. Its worth a shot?|`|FrqKyNdAaa	Try researching the Invisible Fence.  We had it installed in our yard and our cattle dog/chow mix won't cross her boundaries even without her collar on.  Then she doesn't always have to be tied or on a leash.|`|yQn04QlEaa	the best thing to do is stay outside with the dog.  how you gona feel when come outside looking for your dog that you left alone out side and he done got out and got hit by a car????????  think about it|`|tabS8yHPaa	I know it sounds mean but en electric fence works great for me all they do is touch it once and they will never go near the fence again i have a husky with the same problem, and its alot cheaper than the invisible fence its not that your doing any thing wrong some dogs are like that. good luck
n7bok7NRaa	Since you weren't paying extremely close attention it would be hard to say, but your cat might have scratched you for any of these reasons:    ~ She wanted more pets out of you.    ~ She was irritated/excited by all the petting, and took a swat at you simply because the petting wound her up.    ~ You might have been twitching your hand, just a little bit and she just attacked what she thought was a toy/critter.    Yes, cats do have dreams, and they possibly have nightmares, but the issue is that they have very minimal body control while they dream (resulting in the shaking and twitching they do). It's unlikely she scratched you because she was having a bad dream.|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	mabey it just wanted to play|`|gat4KThKaa	Cats is nice but can be mean, I think she was having a nightmare.    And yes can have nightmares.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	cat's have a vendetta aganist humans.|`|LBlSeLC0aa	cats are very opinionated creatures.  she wanted you to continue petting her.  you stopped and she didnt care that you were watching tv..she wanted petted and she was going to get what she wanted lol|`|CGxnLNWOaa	IT HAPPENS!

SO YOU ARE LUCKY!|`|pA4kkR0waa	cats are evil|`|y2ywR3X9aa	could be trying to play or if she was asleep maybe you moved your hand and startled her|`|FrMbsYQWaa	cats are not evil,and it has happened to a lot of cat owners for various reasons .A few  very good ones given already.One subject not brought up was the breed of your cat.Certain breeds such as Siamese can be very temperamental.The reason being because of bad breeding.  In other words your cat might might be screwed up in the head because of interbreeding which can happen to any variety of cat but goes way back in Siamese.
7IVrBiT1aa	Start a protest and get everybody you know to join in.  Stand on the side of the road's holding up signs saying the name of the place should be shut down! And then go have people sign a petition and try to get up to as many possible.|`|B7qPxYqHaa	These are some companies that I would like to shut down too!  Easy-Bake, its not really that easy and its lame!  Floam, doesn't work.  Spirit MT, skiing slopes.  Candy Grams, don't even get me started with those! They're little stickers with cheap suckers attached that my school sells for 50cents and gives out for V-Day!   Any way, about your issue. I would complain, and have people sign a petitions. At my school, during winter you had to have snow pants and boots t go on the snow, and you had to have boots to go on the blacktop. If you had no boots then you had to stand by the wall. on kid formed a petition and had the entire grade sign it. The next day we could go on the blacktop in tennies! Power of Petition!
8owlj2xHaa	Some say an anemone opens and closes when hungy, Open when hungry, or it could be something is bothering it. IE flow, a shrimp, crab.  The other fish are bothering it because those fish are known to be territorial. Damsels are the worst for this and the reason most experienced salties will tell you never to add them. Clown Fish are also Damsels and should be added to your list after some of the more delicate fish.|`|hz0I0zFWaa	For the anemone it's most likely water quality or lighting.  Six line wrasse being new to the tank.
bseGACNXaa	Budgies can be messy so I would start by taking over some vacuuming chores to show you will keep the area clean.  Perhaps you have had another pet to show that you can keep fresh water in the cage.  If you have been bad about that, then you might want to start out with caring for something a little easier like a Betta fish.  They are friendly and forgiving if you forget a pet chore now and then.  I have had a number of budgies and I have to tell you that some are friendlier and more trainable than others.  Spend a long time choosing, not just on looks, but behavior and response to your whistles and movements.|`|EHBX1F54aa	Tell Mom that having a budgie is a good exercise in learning responsibility.  Remind her that the bird will rely entirely on you for its care and survival, and that you feel you are old enough to care for the bird well.  After all, pets are a great way to learn responsibility!    Be sure you're ready for the commitment, though.  Remember, you'll have to clean its cage daily, change its water and food daily, spend time with it, and find someone to care for it if you have to travel.|`|e6wo7czgaa	Show you have a strong interest in it. Use your computer to do research on budgies and minimize it when your finish. Its a silent " I really like want it!" without it getting annoying when they get onto the computer. Take out books from the Library about that specie too. when you found out interesting things about the bird tell them about it. Leave the books in open views, but not very obvious ones. Just where you've been reading about it. than get a jar. Fill it with some money. when your parents ask what you are saving for tell them its for the bird. If she say's you can't have one tell her, that's okay I'll have the money ready when I move out. clean your room, and clear a certain area on a desk. leave it empty for couple of weeks and tell them that's where you see the cage being. You could also help out around the house, clean things up and do stuff but never tell anybody you did till they ask. All of these work. :D  Finche approved.

I love nice friendly big dogs|`|atX1AurJaa	I personally love pit bulls!! I have one now, and have had 2 in the past and they are/were the best pets ever!!! They do have a bad rep, but a chihuahua can make bite marks on a person just the same as a pit!! It all depends on how they are brought up.     "PUNISH THE DEED, NOT THE BREED!"
VDP3pNCPaa	He is seeking attention, but he needs to be trained that biting you is not appropriate.  As he grows, the bites can become much more serious.    When he bites, you need to give a strong NO reaction, and withdraw your hand, if that is what he is biting.  Perhaps a very gentle bop on the nose while saying NO!    He is, in a way, playing, but you are not another cat, and cannot give him the feedback another cat would do.  By saying NO, you are giving him feedback.|`|CtBVWMeoaa	well shes just trying to get your attention, my cat still scratchs me on my arms so, maybe your not giving him/her enough attention|`|oxze6fRzaa	sounds like your cat wants some attention   if you havent had him for long then you will think "hey he bit me that hurt" but after a while it doesnt hurt a bit and your cat just wants some attention beleive me my cat does it constantly but you get used to it and after a while its kind of funny        oh and if he is rolling over my cat always wants me to give her belly a rub and thats probably all you need to do and if he bites even then hes just playing around and as i said you will get used to it
w1lh1INHaa	There are a few things you need to understand about breeding a female.  The first is the serious health risk you put her under.  In the past week I have seen a dozen or so questions regarding a mother cat that died giving birth.    Mamas rarely get buddies with their children.  At some point a Queen will push her kittens away, and frequently will never love them the way she did when they were kittens.  It is highly likely she will hiss at them, not want them around, and be  highly aggressive.  Most mamas are NOT buddies with their kittens.    Are you really prepared to feed and pay the vet bills (including neutering and spaying) of oh, 7 or 8 more cats in your household?  At an average cost for the care of a cat being $1,000 per year, do you really have that much money?  Each kitten and mama will have to be altered or there will be inbreeding and lots and lots and lots of kittens.  At only four kittens, 5 alterings will run you about $1200 let alone other costs.    Some females simply do not have maternal instincts.  Again, over the past month I have seen five or six questions about "my cat just has kittens...why is she ignoring/not feeding them?"    How do you know your cat won't like another cat?  It takes 3-6 weeks for cats to acclimate with each other.  Having had 17 cats during my life (owned and fostered) there is always hissing and anger when a new cat comes into the house.  Once everyone is settled in, what lovies they can be.  Get a book from the library or a pet store or look up on the internet how to socialize cats.  One of the things is to get your smell on the new cat -- you said yourself, that is the issue.  There is a wonderful product called Feliway that makes a diffuser that helps acclimate cats in days.    You simply cannot count on your cat enjoying or even wanting to be around her kittens.  That is simply not how it works, but quite the opposite.      Rather than go through the hassle and expense of trying to get her pregnant, try and socialize her with another cat or kitten.  As I said, there are many informative sites on how to do it CORRECTLY.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Cat's do not feel human emotions like depression as you suggest. By transferring your beliefs onto the cat, you are doing her an injustice. If she does not like other cats, she likes to be alone, she is not lonely or depressed. Why don't you try some other breed of animal if you insist on getting her a friend.   To spay is the humane choice.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	So you're going to keep all the kittens?    So if she has eight kittens, you'll pay for nine times shots, nine times fixing (because brothers and sisters still will mate), and nine times for anymore health problems?     You're putting feelings on your cat. Spay the damn thing- she doesn't WANT to have kittens, and doesn't WANT to be mated. Mating is infact PAINFUL for a female cat- as is being pregnant, and giving birth, and feeding her kittens, and the cancer she's highly likely to get if you leave her unspayed.|`|4aAhEK9daa	And your question is WHAT?  This isn't a question - it's just a rant - so you've been reported.    And your last comment is completely wrong.  If you wanted more kittens you could go adopt some.  But instead by having kittens you wouldn't be adopting so what happens to the shelter animals?  They're put to death.  It's all a matter of numbers - regardless of whether the cats stayed at your house or went out to others.    I'm guessing that you really haven't tried the RIGHT WAY to introduce this cat to other cats.  You've just brought another animal into the home, plunked it down and expected everything to be fine.  But your cat reacted - it hissed, it growled, it ran off and hid - which is A TOTALLY NORMAL REACTION any cat would have if an animal is thrust into its territory without warning.    The key is SLOWLY introducing another animal.  Have the new animal in a separate room behind a closed door with its own food, water and litter.  Put an old tshirt with the new animal to get its scent on it then put this shirt out with the existing cat - and then back again.  Only when BOTH animals are at ease and seem eager to see what lies beyond the door THEN you allow them to interact.  And of course only after the new cat has been fully checked out and disease-tested by a vet.    Having a litter of kittens is a ridiculous solution.  What if she rejects the kittens entirely - and you're left having to bottle feed all of them?  And what if there's a complication during birth and she DIES trying to deliver them?
VDP3pNCPaa	Seems like you have a fairly normal cat.  It is a game, that only they know the purpose of.  If I gather from your question, you are wondering why she is so seemingly affectionate by following you and rubbing against you, but when you try and pick her up or perhaps touch her, she runs.    You may be able to change that slowly, by letting her find out that your contact is not negative. If each time you pick her up, she winds up in the cat carrier and on the way to the vet, she remembers!    One of  my young cats is incredibly affectionate, but picking her up becomes a game for her.|`|AA11259647	so do you want her stop following you or to stop running after you? It's not clear in your question....|`|iDxoM3X8aa	What do you want from the cat her to be loving or not to be.cats have moods just like us you dint seem sure what you want so no wonder the cat is unsure.just let her be.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	your cat is crazy.
bDPVRtCNaa	Honestly, you can find a 2.5 gallon or a 10 gallon tank for under ten dollars at Petsmart, and the Hydor mini heater is 13.99.    Whatever type of fish you have it's best to treat them right, no matter their size.     All fish deserve a filter as well.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	You can't heat a bowl safely. I wouldn't put a heater on any tank that holds less than 5 gallons of water.
w1lh1INHaa	Humans are allergic to one or both allergens in a cat -- one is the dander, the other is the protein in a cat's saliva.  Not all cats are the same, and some people are allergic to some cats and not others.  Currently, there is an effort to breed hypo-allergenic cats for such people.    I saw a product at the pet store the other day, and it was a shampoo for cats to help alleviate the dander allergy.  You might want to give that a try.     If it is a protein/saliva issue, then don't let the cat lick or rub its face on you, and wash your hands after any licks or pets.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	It certainly is! It all depends on how much dander the cat gives off. The only way to know for sure is to try|`|n7bok7NRaa	Yes. Ultimately, you are allergic to your cat as well, but to a lesser extent - especially if you keep your own home free of allergens, and you spend a lot of time with your kitty.    While habituation does not work for all allergies, there are some who can eventually learn to stop reacting to a allergen if they are exposed to it for a long enough period of time.|`|BOKMpwEcaa	it depends sometimes i short hair and long hair. my 1 cat doesn't really shed and im fine, but my other cat sheds like no other and makes me sneeze cough and red runny eyes. so i would say yeah

CRhS02q8aa	Cats are amazing creatures.  I had a cat that was bitten by a water moccasin and lived.  His hair fell out in the area for a few weeks but it did grow back.  He has actually been bitten 3 times and is still healthy.  I wouldn't worry too much unless the cats activity decreases. This would be a cause for concern.  If she is still playing and eating..this is a very good sign.  Just do what the vet says and watch for infection.  If the wound smells or beings to look red and inflamed I would definitely take her in for antibiotics.  The hair loss only seems to be due to the fact it is itching and she is licking and scratching.|`|WJjr2E0haa	I would call another vet and see what they say. If it has been a few days then she probably wasn't poisoned.|`|AA12322387	First, your cat shouldn't be left outdoors.  The Humane Society of the United States as well as the ASPCA all urge owners to bring cats indoors for reasons such as this.    My first concern would be that the wound becomes abscessed and if your cat doesn't leave it alone, it will.  That is painful and also very smelly.    Do what your vet recommended and keep a close eye on the wounds.  If they seem to be getting worse or not improving, take the cat to the vet.    And leave your cat inside.|`|AA10187097	Take your cat in person to a vet and have them examine it. A phone call isn't good enough where your pet's health is concerned.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	The thing that I have experienced numerous times with my cats fighting is abscesses. The outside of the wound will heal over but infection gets trapped inside. The area will swell, become very hot, and if opened with have pus in it. (gross, I know) Abscesses can be very dangerous and need to be treated by a vet with an anti biotic and the vet opening the wound back up.    You say the wound looks okay though? If it is healing without looking infected or irritated...it will probably be fine. If not, I would see a vet.|`|sagVFrksaa	i have had another cat bite and scratch one of my cats. my vet says as soon as there is an injury to put an antibiodic ointment on it. that will keep it from getting infected. it works! and saves on vet bills. the hair will grow back! and the cat is only trying to keep it clean itself.  you can buy generic versions of Neosporum.|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	If there are coyotes where you live, are there snakes?     I don't know when this happened, and in the worse-case scenario, the cat would be dead. But I would call another vet.|`|AA11780840	I strongly urge you to take the Kitty to the vet and make sure he/she gets antibiotics ..... Left untreated it will get infected and it can lead to sepsis. Once the blood is infected there is nothing that can be done. In turn the kitty will ultimately needs to be put to sleep.... I am not trying to scare you. But this happened to my uncle's 6 year kitty on Christmas eve he was in a fight or something and even with 2 rounds of antibiotics, a couple weeks after the bite he had to be put to sleep.. Be aggressive a kill any chances of infection for your kitty.    Take the kitty to another vet.....if the one you took him/her too won't do anything else...|`|YVOlCNmaaa	The same thing has happen to my cat that stays outside. The cat will be fine. There tongue is like a healer and all we did was put peroxide on it. We thought his tall was gonna stay balled but it grow back eventually.|`|9fdyfwO4aa	vet check - she should go on antibiotics & is she up on her shots (rabies?).  Watch for abscess too.  Hope she recovers perfectly!|`|iDxoM3X8aa	as long as the cat has her jabs and the vet does not seem to worried just put the cone on and see how it goes you could bathe the tail with a little warm water and a spot of salt it may help .poor cat hope she will feel better soon.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Personally, I'd be looking for another vet. I would expect ANY competent vet to say, "why don't you bring her in and we can take a look at it". Anytime there is an open wound, there us chance of infection or other problems. If it was MY cat, it would be seen by a vet.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Probably a cat bite, which can be very dangerous.  Cats have needle sharp teeth, so the bites they make don't drain - they seal the infection in and the wound becomes infected and abscessed.  Abscesses need to be drained, and often an antibiotic needs to be given also.  If she's licking it enough to get a bald spot, it hurts her!  Putting a cone on her to stop the licking will do nothing to clear up any underlying infection.  Time to call another vet, and get her seen.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	It was probably just another cat if the wound is small. You might want to take her to the vet to get tested for rabies or any other disease though. Those cones you can find at your local pet store for a few bucks. Just put one of them on her and put some triple antibiotic on the wound. She should heal in a few days.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	I would expect my vet to want to evaluate the bite wound and provide antibiotics to prevent infection, if needed.    When you do not know what bit your cat, it just seems foolish to leave the wound unattended.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	You may have a real serious issue, depending on the rabies situation and if your cat is current on his vaccinations. If rabies vaccinations are required by law, and your cat is not current, most vets are prohibited from treating an animal wound from unknown sources.    If your cat is current with a rabies vaccination, I would take her in to see the vet.  Lots of bad things, like cysts or infections could happen.
I6NwduJPaa	Depends on where you live. but if you live anywhere in North America, I'm telling you right now you won't get one.     Do you live on a HUGE proporty?

The big cats are not mean to be owned and caged. I'm not positive but I think that cheetahs, like so many other big cats, are an endangered species.  So don't buy one. All my life I've only wanted to pet a tiger, not own one, but I am probably going to die with this dream unfulfilled.  I wouldn't even consider owning one.  I have two lazy housecats that love me as much as I do them.  That's good enough.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	The law says you have to chase one down and tame it with your bare hands, which is proof that you are responsible enough to own it.|`|jQglJiMhaa	this question only made me laugh.

iiNAJfGCaa	Thoroughbreds are notoriously hard keepers, especially during the winter. How many times a day is he getting hay? Ideally he should be fed good quality hay 4x a day. Horses are "trickle feeders" which means they are able to digest food more easily when they are fed a little at a time instead of a lot at once. On top of that you can add grain. Since your horse is TB and may already be high energy by nature, I would suggest oats. Contrary to popular belief, oats are actually one of the lowest energy cereals but are highly digestible and contain a lot of calories. I supplement my oats with a 1/2lb of rice bran (which can be purchased at any feed store) AM & PM. The rice bran is a great source for extra calories and is wonderful for their skin and coat. He'll be gleaming come summer time! Once he starts to get the weight back on you can target his hind end with hill work and lots of transitions both on the lounge line and under saddle. Good luck!|`|gH8yrDkvaa	I dunno this may work but...How about giving him some food|`|NEA9bsbdaa	sandbags always work|`|AA11570905	He is not losing the weight due to the cold weather.  He is losing the weight because he is using more energy to keep warm.  Give him good quality grass hay, nearly free choice.  Blanket him if he is shivering and make sure he has adequate shelter.  If he doesn't start putting the weight back on almost immediately then have his teeth checked.    My horses get round bale of hay to share.  they are on the bale for at least 12 hourse every day.  Then they go into the barn overnight and then back out on the round bale.  I don't have any weight issues.|`|z90jPBMLaa	If hes lost weight. get him on a weight builder supplement and feed (pellets or sweet feed) and lots of work on hills. Make him use his back end. Then more and harder you work him make sure you up his feed. and if you would stop working him for awhile  or drop off on how much you work with him drop the feed back down.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Ride him up hills to get his back end more muscular. If you want to add weight, give him some more hay. Hay is what keeps them warm in the winter so he will need a little extra. Other than that, keep up the good work!|`|VmZKZjP1aa	The easy way to build any muscle is food and exorcise. Obviously you are doing both.  For the back end specifically...galloping and lot's of hills.     Good luck|`|px27V5N9aa	Jeff Sadler answered how I was going to.  Trotting, hills, up the feed.      If his hay is all gone in the morning when you get there, you need to up it one more flake.  Add another 1/2 scoop of grain  Corn oil|`|sbB0TpGXaa	lots of hills.    The hindquarters are used for propulsion.  So increase the propulsion by cantering up hills.  I suggest sets of ten.  Then rest then ten more.  Start slow build up.  Sorry can't be more specific since I haven't seen the TB or the area you are riding in so I do not know the length or steepness of your hills.    You will also need to up the food intake.  I give a protein rich grain to the horses I am working.  It helps build muscle.|`|X40Ww89qaa	get him pregnant|`|bI7wMCJXaa	He needs to be blanketed. Thoroughbreds are not good in the cold until they're about 10 then they become easy keepers.    You can't put weight on specific areas, just like you can't lose it from specific areas. Make sure he has plenty of hay and keep him working. Thoroughbreds that are fit and in shape keep weight on better than TBs that aren't.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Lots and lots of work on hill. Hills will build the hindquarters because they are the main muscle group  used to propel the horse up the hill. Do it all main gaits.      Weight supplements can help, but that doesn't really build muscle
XI2iylR4aa	It is very responsible of you to get your rabbit neutered.  It might be a good idea to get your doe spayed, too, because female rabbits are at a high risk for uterine cancer.    As for the risk of neutering, it varies from vet to vet, and from rabbit to rabbit.  The best thing you can do for your rabbits is to get a good  vet.  This site has a listing of rabbit-savvy vets:  http://rabbit.org/vets/index.html    If you have a good vet, the risk is very low, less than 1 in 100.    good luck to you and your rabbits.|`|AA12322387	There is risk with any operation.  Talk to your vet about it..they should be able to ease any concerns that you have.  This is a very common procedure that vets perform.|`|9fdyfwO4aa	very slim chance.  vets do these procedures all the time & if the animal is healthy all should go well.|`|3ex9tJKmaa	He will be fine, ive just had mine done and i too was worried but the vet reassured me that he would be ok.  it is a very quick operation and certainly easier for the boys than the girls, but whilst youre taking the boy bunny i would take the girl bunny too, it is much better and healthier for them both to be done. You will need to keep them in for a few days after the opertaion away from any draughts.  but please dont worry as long as they are fit and healthy they will sail through the operations.|`|K4UmeHyQaa	dont worry my DWARF hamster had it done .. there was a risk of him dying to !

My friends hamster had a operation too and there was a risk that she would die to but she didnt..   Hopfully he wont  =D|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Your bunny will be fine. The neutering surgery for boys is much easier than for girls. He won't even be under anesthesia for very long.  And when he becomes an adult he will be a much nicer and sweeter bunny than if he hadn't been neutered.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	You should get them both fixed, actually - male and female.    There's always a small risk when you anesthetize a small animal, but if the rabbits are young and healthy, and as long as you go to a vet who has experience with rabbits, the risk is minimal. I've heard anywhere from a 1 in 500 to a 1 in 1000 mortality rate, which is from .2 to .1%. It's a very safe procedure - just make sure you go to a small animal or exotics vet, since neutering a rabbit is different than neutering a cat or dog.    By getting them both fixed, you'll increase the chances that they stay friends throughout adulthood - intact rabbits can be very aggressive and territorial. They'll generally be happier when they're altered.    Also, female rabbits have a very high risk of reproductive cancer later in life, so spaying early is a good preventative measure.     Here's a good FAQ on spaying and neutering:  http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/spay-...    That website also has a directory of rabbit vets in case you don't know of a good one in your area.     Good luck with your rabbits!|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Like everyone else has said: there is a risk, and always will be, when operating.  Usually, a healthy, young animal does just fine during anesthesia and the operation.    Always keep an eye on the recovering bun.  I had my rabbit spayed and guinea pig neutered.  The surgeries went off without a hitch and they healed fine.  However, the vet 1) left one side of my bun's ovaries in which turned cystic and twisted, requiring surgery *again* and shortened her life span and the quality of it, 2) they left necrotic tissue in my guinea pig which created an abscess that was pushing his organs out of his body, which required 3 months of abradings and minor surgeries every week to correct (this, too, shortened *his* lifespan).  And these were experienced exotic vets.  I don't mean to scare you, or anything like that.  More than likely, everything will be fine and you will have healthy, happy bunnies.  It's just important to remember that there IS more risk than just the actual surgery.  If you notice anything odd (my Poppy didn't start showing signs of anything until 3 months after the surgery), get them in as soon as you notice it (infection at the surgery site, but also unexplained personality shifts, etc--that, too, is a sign of something wrong.  My rabbit healed quickly and without infection, but by month 3 after, she had gotten aggressive and solitary, which was unlike her).    Good luck.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	The neutering surgery is rather non invasive. Obviously nothing is perfect, but the risk is minimal.
AA12128656	lol rachel- i have a similar problem with a neighbor's dog- and they always tell me how nice my pit bulls are....    one thing i'm wondering about is whether this little dog has enough to do? my brother in law has a pug who's very busy and will yap at anything if he's bored.   sounds like the dog also needs to be socialized and tired out. the socialization might also desensitize it a bit...  how old is the dog?   will the lady let you feed it? maybe you could help, by giving it a treat when it goes quiet when you're outside- it might then learn to sit pretty for strangers, rather than bark at them.    i'm really at a loss on this one- i know how i'd handle it with my own dogs, but alas, this is a small pug, not a large, dominant junkyard dog...|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Is she exercising the dog on any regular basis?

To help you research information, the Electric Yellow's scientific name is Labidochromis caeruleus. It is also know in the aquarium hobby as the Yellow Lab. "Caeruleus" means blue, and the originally described form of this fish is blue, but the yellow form also exists in the wild (in Lake Malawi), and the yellows have become so popular that we hardly ever see the blue ones.|`|tShDXmgbaa	They can take anywhere from 8 months to a year depending on how well they are cared for including types of food they are fed.

AA12377116	make it easy on yourself.    I do feed them home made dog food once a day but in addition I have an "at will" feeder. It is a little barrel filled with kibble that feeds into a bowl and the dogs munch from it whenever they want.    At first, if you have been doling out the food at specific times and your dog gets nuts at feeding time, then your dog may eat until he's sick for a few days. After a while, when he understands that the food will always be there, never run out, he'll relax and eat only what he needs and only when he is hungry.    Bless your heart for rescuing this dog. Rescues have special needs and may even hord and hide some food for  a while, until it gets comfortable and forgets what it's like to be hungry.    Your dog also needs lots of exercise and as long as you exercise him (at least one hour of intense exercise every day adn two hours is best) he won't get fat.|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	look on the back of the bag of dog food you are feeding him. it should tell you how much according to age and weight he should get.|`|PdotFx4naa	It depends.

If you are using good quality nutritious food, it is safe to leave food out all the time.

Dogs will eat until they are "nutritionally" satisfied, so if you are using a less nutritious brand to save money, you will actually spend more money.

AA12377116	No grapes or raisins...or onions or garlic...or cashews or macadamia nuts or chocolate, they all have toxic elements.    Carrots are good for them, they like the cruch, and they are a little sweet but not too sweet.    My little girl dog likes kosher pickles. She has a few bites every time my husband has one.    They both like apples, cored, peeled and diced small.    They both like string cheese and they get one each a day. And every now and then, vanilla ice cream.    Don't give them celery unless you peel the stringy stuff off, cause it can get tangled in their intestines before it gets digested and then you have a vet emergency.

You'll also want a stripping comb - it's much easier on your hands. But if you're not showing the dog, then stripping is really an unnecessary and time consuming process, IMO. Just use the regular clippers. Sure the coat won't be as harsh as hand stripped, but it will be much easier to deal with in the long run.|`|vPde97E2aa	ALL hand-stripped breeds are done the same way-just different PATTERNS!

Citrus sprays are pretty effective in deterring cats. If you want to make sure your cat will respond to this, take an orange or pierce an orange peel to release the citrus scent and if your cat turns away, it's likely your cat does not like it.|`|IuYekkPVaa	It's a little known fact that cats rarely scratch places that they chin rub.  Feliway mimics the scent found in their facial glands, so spraying it once a day (for 21 days) on items that you want to protect, can deter them from scratching there.  (Feliway will also replace his claw scent, which is what's attracting him to keep scratching there.)    The most effective way to prevent unwanted scratching is to provide them with something of their own that they're allowed to scratch.  If yours is refusing to use a sisal post, try offering him sheets of corrugated cardboard or a wooden log instead.      These links have really helpful advice on ways to prevent cats from scratching furniture and encouraging them to use their own scratch item.    http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...  http://www.catscratching.com/    Hope this helps.|`|VFW1MCeCaa	go to the local pet store they will have some.

I had a small crab and ended up naming him Houdini, they are escape artists.  I thought there was no way my crab could get out but I watched him make several amazing attempts and kept moving the things he was using to climb out.  Finally one night he disappeared and I never did find him.  I know he didn't get eaten because nothing in my tank was big enough to eat him.  I watched him climb a plant and jump from it to the tube that comes down from my filter and climb from it to my heater and out of the tank where I caught him and put him back in.  Just make sure you have no tall plants or anything that might allow him to get to the top of the tank by any means.|`|8bef1b50aa3d5b7e84321e722510a842aa	You want crabs? Take a $100 bill and head downtown.  Hehe|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Their are only a FEW species of freshwater crabs that can live under the water 100 % of the time. Very few shops have them as they are a specialty item. Definitely can't be found at walmart lol. All other crabs like hermit crabs and such need to have land to get out on or they will drown.  Crayfish or freshwater lobsters on the other hand can in fact live under the water all the time and will clean up some of the extra food but they create more waste thus negating any value that they have to begin with. Plus they will try to eat your fish, not a good combo.     The best option is to buy a gavel vacuum and use it. It doesn't produce waste and it sucks up the leftovers. Just feed less and do 40 % water changes every week along with vacuuming the gravel and you will be fine.    BTW FYI    No fish or invert eats the poop of any animal. Thats what the bacteria that grows in the tank does. Again there is NO fish or Invert you can buy that eats poop at all.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Be sure you're getting a freshwater crab, not a marine (saltwater) crab or a land or tree crab. Most of the crabs sold in pet stores are land hermit crabs, which cannot live underwater. They aren't true crabs, either, to be technically correct.    There are not many freshwater crab species in the world, and even fewer in the pet trade, so your choices will be limited, if you can find one at all. They aren't likely to have them at Wal-Mart. Any freshwater crab you get also will probably eat your goldfish, either now or after it grows a little.

AA10859773	It's not just about the number.  There are other criteria.    1.  You must be inordinantly fond of the cat(s).  Talk baby talk to them, put them above any humans and your own needs.  2.  They must all have silly names.  Mr. Fuzzy Wuzzy is one example.  3.  Your home must smell like a litter box.    However, I do think you must have at LEAST 4 cats before you can qualify.  Having 4 cats doesn't make you crazy; having one cat named Mr. Fuzzy Butt doesn't make you crazy.  It's the combo that elevates you to the level of the crazy cat lady.    Oh I almost forgot!  You must also own a straw broom which you use to chase children away from the yard.|`|c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	When your number of cats exceeds the number of plates in your cupboard...

2CbfO4jWaa	breeding savs is easy, provided you have a large enough ,properly set up enclosure (hhmmmm whats that?)  and in-deed a pair. there is just no payoff (who will pay $150 for a c.b.b. when a w.c. is $25 and if you cant sell them what do you do with all those hatchlings? savs. lay ALOT of eggs!). when kept right you cant stop monitors from breeding (like dogs they will breed even when sick and dying). the main concern for anyone breeding any species of monitor is the substrate. if the female doesnt recognize it as something usable she will not nest, she will hold her eggs ,MAYBE reabsorb them if your lucky but more often then not she gets egg bound and dies. you may have to separate the pair if there is aggression issues when gravid(female attacking the male / nest guarding) or if the male keeps disrupting the female nest digging.    p.s. remember getting eggs is the easy part.knowing when she laid, digging them out safely, in time and incubating them right, THAT is the hard part! good luck.
bTck5pPcaa	I wouldn't be too worried. I have a corn snake and she usually doesn't eat for a while before and after shedding. Their metabolism is much slower than humans so your snake can live for a while without eating snake snake went about 4 months without eating. You can't force them to eat, so all you can do is wait until they are ready to eat again. Just keep trying. Also, if she's eating pinkies then at least she's eating something...|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Don't get too worried yet.  Wait a couple more days and try again.  Watch her for signs of illness: labored breathing, lethargy, bloody stool, erratic behavior ect...  If she seems sick, take her to a vet.       If you tried to feed her pinkies from a different source than she is used to she might just be confused.  My snake only likes one brand of pinkies, but she will eat others when she's hungry enough.  You could also try thawing it in warmer (not hot) water, just to make it more appealing.|`|D2sMKkchaa	Now it is time to worry about your Corn Snake.She maybe still in stress.
L1EccMeZaa	Here's a page with a load of info. I suggest you read it from top to bottom. http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...    A lot of people think rabbits are easy to take care of, but they are very delicate. They need a lot of attention, you shouldn't just shut it up in it's cage. You need to feed it the right diet or it could lead to health problems. And when you let it run around the house, make sure there is nothing dangerous like cords around since they love to chew on things. Never give it a full bath. Rabbits groom themselves.    I have had my bunny for almost 8 years, and I love him to pieces! He's just the cutest little guy, and he's brought me so much happiness. :)|`|2YIxnXXyaa	I like x..Viixy..x's answer a lot.    But try to make sure you get a younger one, you'll have it longer, they'll be a little scared at first, but if you get it while it's young you can kind of train it, if you will, to be more people friendly.  Older ones will too but some of them are mean-ish and picky to what they can tolerate.    Also, they can't see to the side of them, only directly in front of them.  So when you approach it, make sure it's directly in front of them, or gently talk to them before you touch it.  Otherwise, s/he will jump at you their paws and make a snorting noise.  Took me years to figure that out with my rabbits.|`|OlBiAoxZaa	*feed 2 times a day  *play with it  *let it run around  *get toys.......etc|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	Well rabbits are very sociable they need to have attention every day, if you get two they both need to be neutered even if they are both male or both female.     Your rabbit needs a cage where its high enough to stand on its hinde legs, and long enough to stretch out fully.     They need fresh water every day, 1 bowl of pellets every day, & fresh hay everyday. Don't give them fruit & veg everyday because they may get the runs, give it to them every other day, don't panic if they don't like some fruit & veg just try different ones until you find their  favorites!     They need to be vaccinated from VHD once a year and myxomatosis every 6 months.     They need their nails clipped when they grow too long and they need a rock or anything to wear their nails down, they like to play so stick tunnels balls will entertain them! They also need their fur brushed at least twice a week!    They also need lots of sapce outside the hutch but never leave them outside by themselves.     Make sure you have a vet on hand as rabbits are very sensitive, if they stop eating you need to get them to a vet straight away.    Rabbits are very nervous so if they start thumping their hinde legs and running around, you need to clam them down right away as dome rabbits can die from this.    Rabbits don't make good pets for children or go good with other animals, they need to be handeled every day or they will run away every time you try to pick it up.    When you first get your rabbits place it in their hutch and make sure it hhas a place to hide and get used to their new surrondings for a few hours.    There are many different types of rabbits i reccomend you look them up, there is no rabbit that is easier to take care of. Please buy a rabbit from a rabbit rescue they need a home and they deserve it! Rabbits from big chain pet stores breed their rabbits and the ones that don't get bought you can guess what happens!    Good Luck and i hope this helped!!    xx|`|ygN7vmqvaa	1: get cage  2: get food  3: get toys(to chew on)  4: get a young cute one(they last longer)  5: go home  6: get cage ready  7: clean cage once a week  8: enjoy|`|W1CbOgZcaa	Hey, good choice on a rabbit!

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Ok, let's get terminology right here.    Poisonous means that if you eat it or it's absorbed through your skin, you will get sick or worse.    Venomous means that it has a toxin that is injected directly into the bloodstream, causing you to get sick or worse.    There are no venomous turtles.    Wild box turtles eat various fungi that we can't, and toxins are stored in their bodies, so it is recommended that you not eat them in a survival situation.    Here's the thing. Many turtles are kept in unhygenic conditions. Any animal that spends a good deal of time walking around in or swimming around in it's own toilet is likely to harbor various bacteria, among them salmonella, e. coli, etc. It is suggested that you wash and sanitize your hands any time you handle any reptile.|`|ucFH0Ku9aa	There are 7 types of domestic turtles that are extrememly posionous.  The cheetah turtle is the most common and it's venom can kill a human in just 3 to 5 seconds after being bit.

3n60UxgQaa	Yes, you can by reducing stress.    1.  Remember to float the fish for about 15 minutes.  2.  Remember to cycle the tank before putting the fish in.    At the moment, that's all I can think about. (Brain died after that last exam, haha!)|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Here is my method for transferring any fish to a new tank:    Put the fish in a bucket with enough water from the old tank so the fish can swim. Cover the bucket so the fish don't jump out.    Add a cup of water from the new tank to the bucket. Every five minutes, add another cup of water from the new tank to the bucket. Repeat this until the bucket contains more new water than old water. Then wait another five minutes.    Then net the fish out of the bucket and put them in the new tank.    This is a variation on the "drip acclimation" technique. Since I started using this method, I have seen no signs of shock when I put new fish in a tank, and I have lost very few new fish on introducing them. It works much better than the old "float the fish in a bag in the tank for 20 minutes" routine.|`|fySD5rboaa	carefully put them in a plastic ba full of water. carry it gently over to the other tank and put the bag in the water. dont pick out your fish just let them swimm out. to make them feel more relaxed have all the lights of abover or near the tank and put some old ornaments to make some of the new tank feel old.  dont regually clean it straight away because then its like giving them a new home becus the texture and smell they know willl have been washed away ok love   hope this helps. if so gimme ten points please sunshine xx|`|d2JVbyUqaa	First of all make sure that you have already got the things in the other tank set out and the water neutralised for a week.  What you have got to do is put your fish (and water from your 1.5 gallon tank) (1 at a time fish, depending on size) into a big fish bag (one with no holes and obviously not a shopping bag) and make sure that there is oxygen in them. Then tie the top of the bag and put it onto the top of the water on your new tank. let it drift there for 10 mins and then eventually open the top of the bag and very gently, only a tiny bit at a time let some of the water from the tank into the bag, do that for a while and carry on leaving them in the water to get used to it and then eventually let them slowly swim into the new tank. Then tip some of the water from the old tank into the new tank to help keep the balance. You have to do that whole procedure gently and with care (it should take overall about alteast 15 mins) Check that they are fine after a couple of days and then maybe you might want to add a couple more things into the tank. Including maybe during the weeks slowly adding more fish and more aquarium objects e.g bubble machine, fake plant (OH YEAH MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD FILTER IN THE NEW TANK)  Goodluck with your fishies, for more info go to a proffesional fish site. i do have fish myself and have had for a long time and that is what i did to switch my fish from a smaller tank to a bigger.  Goodluck
GSf09ALBaa	Okay, this sort of thing just happened with my Pit.  We were doing a brisk, go baby go walk and her left front went in a hole.  I had to carry 45 lbs of dog a block home. (And I was in more pain than she by the time I made it home).  I made sure she rested by putting her in her kennel for most of the day and within 48 hours she was fine.    So, if you still have the limping after 72 hours (3 days max) or if she starts whimpering, etc see your vet.    Otherwise, it is usually just a muscle strain and they recoup.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	in the mean time dogs can also use aspirin for pain. just be sure about the dosage:    http://www.vetinfo4dogs.com/daspirin.htm...      aspirin tho, not ibuprofen etc.|`|ed74e45df2713059625fa1fd20daec42aa	If she is still limping then I would take her to the vet.  It is possible that she may have just "sprained" something but it is also very common for dogs to tear their ACL just like in humans.  Dogs don't necessarily have to be doing strenuous work for this to happen either.  If nothing else the doctor can affirm that their is or isn't anything wrong and give her some anti-inflammatoy to help with the pain for a few days.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	If she is still limping I would take her to the vet just so they can check it out.

A few years ago I had a b*tch with a large fatty tumor on her stomach that needed removing - local vets and the veterinary teaching hospital were going to charge $1300-$1800.  A friend of mine's vet 350 miles away in Columbia, Missouri did the surgery for $150 (and removed another small tumor on her neck at the same time).    Edit: Gotta love the thumbs down... I wonder what their issue is... the fact that I'm knowledgable enough to shop around and find that driving a bit and visiting a friend (I also went to a dogshow) saved me well over $1000 or the fact that I have friends who are willing to "borrow" out their excellent vets?    I suppose I could have mentioned that the vet in Columbia happens to teach at a veterinary teaching hospital in MO... but I didn't believe it was germaine to the question.|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	How are we suppose to know what is reasonable? we don't know the exact location of the tumor, the depth in which is it... how long they would have to be under, recovery time in the vet, and the type of complications. If you love your animal i would go with the vet that makes you feel most comfortable, and that you like and feel is a great surgeon. not b/c its cheaper or finding the cheapest quote. i understand that sometimes 3000+ isn't in the check books but it's a must. if you can not afford to pay for this you may need to consider signing over to a local non kill shelter. sorry if i wasn't of more help, but we can't be the ones to truly judge here.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	I think that is reasonable!  Your dog is in a lot of pain and it needs to get taken care of right away!  You can probably do a payment plan with them and make payments on it to pay it off.      Go get the surgery and take your dog out of pain!|`|ed74e45df2713059625fa1fd20daec42aa	Comparing those prices to those at the vets office that I work at I would say that they are reasonable prices.  Something to think about for you that may make this easier...many times the cheaper the price is (so if it is much below what you have been quoted other places) you should wonder what difference in care there is going to be.  A lot of times a difference in price reflects the area the office is in and the quality of services that you are receiving.  All in all though those quotes sound right to me.  I think the 2500 one sounds very reasonable.|`|QCgvxwCzaa	What is reasonable at a the pet parent of a beloved pet? You might want to consider pet insurance in the future. I have VPI insurance and I have a cost sheet of what my insurance will cover for most vet visits, so I have a good idea ahead of time what my costs will be and how reasonable my vet bill is!
IrdZKYT3aa	You should be fine, most fish parents provide no baby care aside from the occasional cichlid protecting them.  You don;t have to worry about them being eaten, so you should be fine.  They are pretty much able to eat on their own, so the parents don't have to feed them.   As fry they will be more sensitive to water quality changes and temp so make sure to keep everything as stable as possible and healthy.  Best of Luck!|`|KpNpVnXeaa	They should be okay.  From birth they should be able to go independent.  In fact, breeders often seperate the mother/father because they may eat the babies (fry).  Feed them small cichlid sinking food is my suggestion.    Remember, not all the fry will live, but you should get a decent percent living.      Hope this helps
XPB6Ogj0aa	Only 3 days old, why their eyes aren't even open yet.  Touch them gently for very short periods of time.  I personally think that they are a little two young to be held, maybe when their eyes are open.  Right now I think that you should talk to them and be near them.  They need to get used to your sound and scent.  How is the mother handling this situation with holding her babies?|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	hopefuly you have an appointment for about 6 weeks for the mom to be spayed and have appointments for the kittens for when they are ready for shots and getting them spayed/neutered by about 4 months, I wouldn't let it go much longer than that.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I've handled kittens from the minute they are born and daily after that.|`|DFXyD8riaa	run up to them screaming!  Kittens love that,     that and working on television repair.|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	I would say very often so they get used to you but I wouldn't hold them for long periods of time at first, just for a few minutes each.  Talk gently to them.|`|0rpN2419aa	Awwwwwwwww!  I wish I had one of those little kitties.  They are so cute when they are little like that.  We used to have cats and kitties and gently held them in the palm or our hands and petted them softly as long as the mother cat was okay with it.   So, it's okay to interact with them at that young age, it sounds like you are gentle and that's great.  The kitty gets used to you, and will interact with you more as it grows older.|`|Tkr8F0bQaa	U HAD KITTENS!!!! how unusual,or do u mean,interact with your cats kittens?|`|aa9c6c44a0936578eadf3ff05d261b19aa	get him something to play with. maybe something to chase. kittens love chasing things.  and maybe something like a toy to playwith|`|CGxnLNWOaa	HOLD THEM OFTEN! PLAY WHEN THEY OPEN THE EYES!
iXijnCxOaa	*raises hand*    I respect them for their working ability as well as their general "farm dog" temperament.    Photo in my avatar is Miss Monica at 4 months.. She and her sister make their debut in the show ring next weekend at the ripe old age of 6 months... we're going to hope none of us is embarrassed!|`|W02kTOqmaa	My sister has one! Except she's a midget, lol (my shepherd and husky are taller then she is). And, at 18 months old, she was just diagnosed with epilepsy, which can be commen for the breed. So we are lucky if she'll live to five years old :( But they are such beautiful dogs    http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...  http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...  http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...  http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...|`|KxjUim7yaa	I don't know the breed, but they are attractive|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	I DO TOO!|`|D2sMKkchaa	I love them they are so cute.|`|3JJVMmPnaa	ME TOO!!! They are not only cute but they are great family dogs.
lvBUl3Zdaa	Keep your pets indoors to protect them from large predators, or keep them in a fenced-in area with a roof. )|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	You need to be with your pet at all times. Sadly I have had a friends Pom, who was on a chain fence and a hawk came down swooped it up and when the fence yanked it back, the dog died and had two huge wholes in its back from the hawks claws. Never leave your dogs alone, and if you want them to run around off leash, i suggest a different area like a dog park of some sort. Best of luck! I really hope nothing happens! Have a nice day!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Another reason why dogs should only be outside when the owners can be out there with them.    Edit: Do not kill the hawk.  It's just doing what comes natural.  But if you are there, they'll find something else.|`|AA10029366	You don't. You keep the Chis inside, and *don't* leave them out unsupervised.    If you're standing out near them, the hawk will be much less likely to consider them a meal.|`|bIaywrBCaa	You can't keep the hawks away you just need to keep your dogs on a leash and not let them loose when they are outside. I do hope the chis are not living outside. If they are circling it could be buzzards instead of hawks. Hawks will usually watch and swoop not circle.|`|AA12377116	You don't.     You leave your dogs indoors and when they do go out you go out with them.    I live in the mountains. I have an eight foot fence around my property.     We have hawks that do prey on the cats and dogs up here. You have to be diligent and never let your dogs out alone.    I know it seems ridiculous but it's necessary.    We also have bears and the coyotes here. They walk the stretchers (the top boards that are horizontal about a foot from the top of the fence). The coyotes jump over the fence like it wasn't there.    I have two small dogs and for the past nine years I have not ever let them outside to play alone in their own yard. It's sad, and inconvenient.     I have even placed buckets of golf balls around the yard, to pitch at the yoties.    I'm not overboard or paranoid. In my neighborhood alone there have been four small dogs taken away by yoties in the last three years. I don't know how many cats have been taken.     One coyote actually went into a house through a doggie door, found a dachshund alone in the house, and dragged him away. There was a trail left behind.     Yoties and bears go where food can be had but Hawks are territorial, they rarely abandon their space.|`|AA12128656	yeah, you can't really control wildlife.    a kennel with a top is your best bet.|`|7j1wVBxzaa	throw stuff at it or if yo dont it will peck there eyeballs out alive !!!!!!|`|TyGpWopBaa	its best to keep them inside. when ever you go outside stand really close or put them on a leash|`|rr7NAmG6aa	Shoot the hawk with a Bow and Arrow.|`|P9iQ23gxaa	bb gun|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	get a mountain  lion|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I agree wiht the posters that said shoot the bird. Thats what I would do.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Hawks are protected animals. Do not try to shoot it. I have a covered chicken yard as we have sever types of hawks here. Owls too would grab a Chi. Keep them close to you at all times while outside or in a covered area.
f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	She absolutely could have done it in 30 minutes.  Cats stay in heat even after they get pregnant (because of this, kittens in the same litter can have different fathers).    The people down the street from us got a kitten who goes outside sometimes.  A few weeks ago, the kitten was in front of my house meowing and meowing.  She was only four months old; so I thought she was too young to be in heat, but as I watched she was approached by a stray Tom cat.  She and the Tom mated at least three separate times in less than 20 minutes!    The neighbors were out of town when this happened; so I told them when they got back that they had better get their kitten spayed fast, unless they wanted her to become a little mother.  So, that's my advice to you, too.  Get her to the vet before her pregnancy is too far along for her to be spayed.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	it only takes one time of mating to get pregnant.  get your cat to the vet today and have her spayed.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Cats can get pregnant the FIRST time they mate - where did you hear it takes 4 times?  And yes she could very well be pregnant.    Please take her in now and spay her.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	30 minutes?  That would be a record.|`|n7bok7NRaa	30 minutes is plenty of time - look to youtube for how long it takes.    A cat can and often does get pregnant on the first try, but since they release so many eggs, they may still be impregnated by multiple male cats (and thus have mixed-up litters).|`|CGxnLNWOaa	CHECK IF SHE HAS SCRETCHS IN THE NECK! CATS DO THAT WHEN THEY MATE! BUT ANY WAY, IF YOU DONT WANT TO HAVE MORE CATS, JUST TAKE HER TO THE VET!|`|679I210Yaa	I don't think your cat could have got prgnant in 30 minutes but she may have been in contact with other cats - thats probably why the others sniffed her. Usually, with cats the only way to tell if they're prgnant is when they get fat . .:) Good Luck
i5jNl2Cuaa	No this is not normal, bring him to a vet!|`|m7lHSV7waa	Is his food bowl empty when you get home too?  It's possible that he is just bored while you're gone.  When I worked at an animal clinic we had a dog that lived in the kennel and he would constantly smear and eat his poop, but he was fine when someone would take him home and give him attention.  My suggestion would be to play with him a lot when you do have the time and see if that has any effect.  Especially play with him before you leave for school.|`|vPde97E2aa	No it is NOT!  Allowing your mutt to run loose in filth guarantees it'll never be housebroken as a well as a shi* eater.|`|D2sMKkchaa	Yes,it jolly well is.  Questions like this are always posted like this.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs should not eat poop. There are products you can get like Dis-taste or Forbid. Should be available at your pet store. I have heard pineapple works, but have not tried it.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	It's normal for them to do it, but it's not very healthy for them.  Try to prevent him from doing it.    Paper training almost encourages it.|`|6284ef90ad02ff7d661501eea6c01313aa	No, it is not normal, but it is a known behavior known as coprophagia. But you are lucky because your dog is so young! There are adult dogs who display this behavior and it can be very difficult to break them of it since they've been doing it for so long. Get it under control now so you won't have worries in the future.    There are various reasons why dogs eat their feces. Puppies see their mom eating feces (she does it to keep the den clean and free of smells that attract other animals) and imitate the behavior. Some may do it out of boredom or anxiety.     Besides being gross for people to look at, eating feces exposes your puppy to parasites and diseases. As he gets older he may start to eat feces of other dogs, or develop sickness from his own.    To stop it:  The best way to stop it is to prevent him from being able to eat his feces at all. This means hiring someone to come during the day and let him out to use the bathroom. Puppies at that age shouldn't be left alone for more than 3 - 4 hours anyway. If you cannot hire someone, or leave him with someone, then try to get him on a set feeding schedule so you will know what time he has to poop.    Punishment works while the dog is still in the early stages of developing this behavior. If you catch him doing it say "no" sternly, and 'drop it'. When he moves away from it give him a chew toy or treat instead.     Also you can try adding MSG or pumpkin to his food which gives the feces a bad taste, making it less likely for him to eat it. There is a product you can get from your vet or the petstore called Yuck! or something like that which has the same effect. You may want to pick up some interesting chew toys for him to use while you are away so he would rather play with those than his poop.     Good Luck! Get it taken care of now!|`|x1K9OWx9aa	Yes it  is normal. I dont know why they do it. But whenever i leave my house for school and my chihuahuas poop..... they eat it. I think it is for nutrition or something like that.|`|rr7NAmG6aa	Sounds more like a munchi-poo.
cnZlMojUaa	It sounds like a vet trip is in order. Is there any reason you are concerned about poison? Some poisons will affect the kidneys and when a dog experiences kidney failure they typically won't eat. Kidney issues need to be addressed quickly--dogs can die from kidney failure.    Now you haven't given much information and we are not vets, so it is hard to say what is wrong. However, if you even remotely think there is a risk of poisoning you need to get to a vet ASAP. Also, if the lack of eating goes on for over a day, you should talk to a vet as well.    The only way you will find out if the dog has gotten into poison is for your vet to do bloodwork and tests.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Take her to the vet NOW!|`|l5kWF8m3aa	go to the vet!!! immediately!!!|`|nYv65TlEaa	Do you have poison around the house?  or do you think neighbor has poison?    maybe dog is bored and sleeps,mine sleep when bored,and if I am gone lets say 4 or five hrs when I come back,their food is still in their bowls,but call your vet    is you dog active when awake?or if you throw a ball?|`|LLlsbF48aa	May be diet related...or your dog could just be sick (without the poison subplot).    Here's a good article with more info on how to tell...    http://www.doglirious.com/is-my-dog-sick...|`|PdotFx4naa	If the dog got into poison they would be throwing up all over and/or crapping all over.  They would also be in a lot of pain so if they are just sleeping a lot maybe they're getting sick but I wouldn't point toward poison.  Take it to the vet just to be sure.|`|E4G4SUPAaa	quick go 2 your vet like now dude
JWEZ4PMKaa	I have an 8 month old puppy German Shepard and a 2 year old St. Bernard, so when it comes to food and toys and treats, i spend about $100 dollars a month because i buy the really good food, which isnt cheap. but when i first got the puppy, i spent ALOT more than that because of shots and going to the vet.|`|AA12377116	I have two Bichons. They are high maintenance, like poodles or any other dog in that range of  breed category.    There are many breeds that are less maintenance. But mine costs me.    Food and treats each month: About $100.     I make my own dog food (boiled chicken or london broil) and change that up with tuna at least once a week. I always add a mineral/vitamin supplement to their home made food. I also give them commercial organic dog food a couple times a week.     My dogs are lean, healthy and muscle machines.    I spent about $1800 at the vet last year. Besides their annual exams and shots (about $200 each) there were a couple of emergencies (about $150 each) and their teeth cleanings ($300 for one and $800 for the older dog).    Leashes, harnesses, beds, about $100 a year.    Tags about $70 per year.    Grooming, becasue my dogs have hair that grows constantly, and my groomer clips their nails, plucks the hair out of their ears and brushes their teeth, $45 each per month.    That comes to about $4250 for my two dogs last year.     This figure doesn't include things like monthly heartworm pills or flea applications (which my dogs don't need at this altitude) or toys or paying extra for pet friendly hotels, or their carriers, or any of the myriad of things that come up.    But, they are cheaper than kids, they will never ask me for a car, never need braces, no college tuition, no weddings, so....    These two costly little pups are the best decision I ever made.

And I have to buy toys weekly with two aggressive chewers...a good $15-$20/month.

Frog Pics:  http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&hl...    @@@@    A  toad can refer to a number of species of amphibians in the order Anura. A distinction is often made between frogs and toads by their appearance, prompted by the convergent adaptation among so-called "toads" to dry habitats. Many "toads" often have leathery skin for better water retention, and a brown coloration for camouflage. They also tend to burrow. However, these adaptations are not reliable indicators of its ancestry. Because taxonomy reflects only evolutionary relationships, any distinction between frogs and toads is irrelevant to their classification.    For instance, many members of the frog families Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae, Rhinophrynidae, Scaphiopodidae, and some species from the Microhylidae family are commonly called "toads". However, the only family exclusively given the common name "toad" is Bufonidae, or the "true toads". Some "true frogs" of the genus Rana have also adapted to burrowing habitats, while a bufonid species in the genus Atelopus are conversely known by the common name "harlequin frogs". Similarly to frogs, toads also display metamorphosis from tadpole to sexually mature adult.|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	a toad is a frog which spends most of its time on land, it has dry skin which frogs have moist skin, they are coverd in warts, toad eggs are in a line and frogs are in big bunches.|`|9mXC05hxaa	It's like a frog|`|4HoVVCenaa	Toads are toads, not frogs...

They usually spend most of their time on land.  Often (but not always) their skin is dry and bumpy.  These bumps are NOT warts, but glands under the surface of the skin (usually mild poison producing).
tPGxPDvBaa	I don't think it is harsh but some dogs don't like it esp. if their nails are been cut too short. Sometimes grinding is a better option for some dogs & sometimes not.  You have to try it to find out.  You can take him & have the nails grind down by a pro first & see how he does before buying a grinder.

With the clipper, quicking seems to happen once in a while, no matter how careful I am.   I get rescue dogs in, and sometimes their claws are VERY long, so I am concerned about hurting them.  With the Pedipaws I can shorten their claws little by little, once or twice a week.    My rat terrier freaked out over the Pedipaws, so I still clip his nails, but he is only one out of probably seven or eight dogs that didnt tolerate it.

IrdZKYT3aa	Yes, assuming you are prepared to care for them, they do require just as much care as any other fish.  They shouldn't be kept in anything 2.5 gallons or smaller and need to be heated.  Betta's can TOLERATE being cold, they don't WANT  to be cold, and just like us, being too cold too long can lead to sickness and death.  I have two large betta bowls, 4 and 5 gallons with a small heater for both.  I don't recommend plastic plants, especially in such a small tank, instead try silk.  Plastic can tear their fragile fins, were as silk is pretty, more realistic and most importantly safe for the little guys.  I'm also not a fan of gravel, or at least not much of it.  The water should be changed about every week, and the rocks thoroughly cleaned.  Instead, I use large river rocks and marbles.  It's easier to make sure they get cleaned well.  What ever you use, it has to be cleaned well or bacteria and waste can build up in it and poison the tank or infect the fish.  Getting a small tank for them is another option, and easir to maintain water quality.  They can be kept in a community tank as well, should you choose, depending on the individual bettas temperment.  Some are mroe easy going than other's.    They shouldn't be kept with anything related to them, like a gourami, anything with long colorful fins, like a male guppy, or any known fin nippers, like tetra or barbs.  Male and female bettas can;t be housed together, but female bettas, kept in groups of four or more, can be housed together.  Best of Luck!|`|bqdeD8JHaa	Yup, they can supplement their oxygen needs by taking in atmospheric air when the O2 level drops in the water, which is great for people not good at maintaining their aquariums.... note however that they don't get along with others of their species and, due to their large fins, should not be mixed with any other "fin nipping" fish.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Yes Betta's are good fish for beginners they are very low maintenance and live 5 to 6 years.|`|H4Z0oD7Caa	yeah they r easy to feed just one little pellet of food every day   and clean there bowl once a week or every other week|`|8bef1b50aa3d5b7e84321e722510a842aa	BOTTOM LINE: Yes, just dont put more than 2 in the same tank|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Yes, and no.  Yes, because they are fairly hardy fish, and beautiful.  No, because the fact that they can survive in small bowls (at least for a while) leads people to believe all kinds of false things about what they need and how they should be kept. Above all, they need warm, clean water, but most people keep them in cool rooms without tank heaters.  No, because they are apt to attack any other fish in their tank.  They are also among the more short-lived pet fish. A two-year-old betta is a senior citizen, and since they are usually acquired as adults, there is no way to know how old the betta is when you get it.    So what are good fish for beginners?  In my opinion, not goldfish, guppies, or mollies, which are other favorites.    I'd say start with kribs (Pelvicachromis pulcher). They are hardy, beautiful, amusing, and it is fascinating to watch a pair breed and take care of their young. They are good parents.    Other good choices would be tiger or rosy barbs, zebra danios, giant danios, paradise gouramies, or (if you have a big enough tank) any of the varieties of Trichogaster trichopterus, which include blue gouramies, three-spot gouramies, gold gouramies, and cosby gouramies (all of these are color varieties of the same species).
QdQcAHqaaa	Get a cat.
syT3XUAraa	This happens occasionally when a dog is spayed. When they are cut, some muscles will get cut also, causing them to be weak. She should stop soon, but right now probably needs a dog diaper. If this persists, take her to the vet, as she may have some mild complications.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I would let the vet look at her. I have never had that problem with any of my dogs|`|zSOnXtiQaa	I have heard of this before. My friends German Shepherd was completely house broken and crate trained and once she was spayed, she couldn't hold it anymore. She went in her crate if they didn't get up in the middle of the night to let her out. Maybe her muscles are still healing and need more time to be completely back to normal.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	My female puppy did take a few steps back in her house breaking following being spayed, but I would definetely talk to the vet.  There could be something serious  - like an infection   OR  something so simple as the discomfort from surgery... but I would NOT take any chances...|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yes and no.  I would run this by your vet.  Just a phone call.  And if he thinks she needs to come in, then take her.  Spaying is pretty intense because everything re-productive is removed so she may be in more pain than you realize and can't hold her bladder as well.    It is often according to the dog.  My Pit was spayed at 5 months and I will tell you the honest truth, that dog did not have a clue.  Absolutely no pain.      But, my terrier/mix was neutered (and this is a simple operation and often pretty painless) and he was a baby for 2 weeks.|`|ldXSIWEyaa	Maybe your dog is just sore, and doesn't feel like walking around and using the extra energy to go to her normal spot or letting you know that she has to go. It should go away when her pain is gone, but if it hasn't by this time I would def. talk to your vet about it. Maybe the surgery did something to the muscles that controls her bladder?
jyGTlpzTaa	Pony: Anything up to 3000  Tack: Up to 700 for a saddle (you can get a good leather second hand for a few hundred), 70 for English leather bridle or 30 for a cheap one, Rugs up to 200, grooming kit  30, Buckets and mucking out tools maybe 40. I've probably forgotten stuff here so dont quote me.    Livery: 20 a week grass keep to 40 DIY livery, over 100 full livery.  Hay and straw: Up to 10 a week each. This really depends on local crops and prices in your area.  Feed: Ponies do well on high fibre diets with no hard feed, they really only need hard feed if they are working hard. But if you are feeding hard food, about 10 a week.  Insurance: 30-40 a month.  Worming: not sure how much wormer costs, check horse wormer online.  Farrier- 20-30 for a trim, 40 for fronts, 60 for all four feet shod.    You will also need spare money aside for insurance excess, emergencies and the inevitable torn rugs and things.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I don't know prices in England, but here are the american prices...  just double them and you'll have rough English prices but a lot of things are more expensive in England.    -food (50-200 a month) OR board (300-1200 a month)  -farrier (50-300 every 8 weeks)  -Vet, shots (around 300 a year without emergencies)  -Blanket (100-200, once)  -brushes (20-30, once)  -saddle, bridle, general riding equipment (500-10,000 dollars, once)  -first aid kid (20-50 dollars)  -buckets, general supplies (20-50)  -shavings/straw for bedding (price varies everywhere)    Basically I pay around $6000 a year for my horse, all expenses included.    Horses and ponies are probably the most expensive pet you can get.  They also injure themselves frequently so you need an "emergency fund" for in case the horse gets hurt.|`|OHqRZ9Tzaa	what are you rambling on about? i don't understand a word you are saying.|`|nlsvqLj5aa	insurance - price depends on what you are insuring the pony for and where you get it from    food - again, depends if it has hay or haylege - hay is around 3 a bale, whilst haylege can be between 5 and 15 I would say. it would also probably need hard feed, so that could be maybe 10 a week at the most.    if your pony was to be stabled, it would also need bedding. This can also vary in price depending on how much the pony needs per week, and what type of bedding you get. For example, shavings is more expensive than straw    farrier - if your pony has shoes, they will need changing every 6-8 weeks, which is around 60-70. If the pony doesn't, it will still need its feet trimming, which I think is probably around 20    tack - it depends on the brand of tack, whether it is leather or synthetic, brand new or second hand - it has to fit properly though. For decent tack, maybe 400 or more - the pony may come with tack though.    rugs - again depends on the brand. The average outdoor rug is around 50, stable rugs around the same but this depends on whether the pony was going to be living in or out.    and finally, the cost of keeping the pony somewhere, as well as any vet bills and dentist bills you may have to pay. So overall, not particularly cheap!
w1lh1INHaa	Absolutely your cat senses when you are upset!  Many cat owners will relate similar experiences.  Your cat is trying very hard to get you to cheer up and feel better!      Your cat simply adores you, and feels bad when you do.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	yup, she is trying to cheer you up and I'm sure it helps|`|3arJsZ91aa	When I get upset, mine just walks away.  I guess she can't deal with me crying!|`|y2ywR3X9aa	she is trying to make you feel better because she loves you!|`|AA11945734	You are the Alpha in the household Your cat observes you to be sure that everything is all right. When you get upset, your cat is definitely aware of it and gets upset also. When you are calm, so is your cat.  Isn't it fun being the leader of the pack?
iVQULHqYaa	Neither, I am in the UK and there is a washing machine product  called Ariel BIOLOGICAL. Scrub your carpets with this and your dog will be unaware of the smell, if it still is,  scrub the carpet again because you will have missed a  bit. Or go to your pet shop and ask for one on their products, however I can assure you that Ariel is best.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Get rid of the dog, replace the carpet and padding, that's the best way|`|3giaPYe8aa	Steam clean would be much better.  You want to extract the messes, not rub them in.  Go to the pet store and by a product called Natures Miracle.  You can add this to your steam cleaning maching instead of a different carpet cleaning product.  You might want to pre-spot clean the really bad areas, first.  This exactly what I just did yesterday!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Steam clean, I guess.  But sometimes it's better to just throw out the carpet.|`|63c46881d0aa0376d34c1858ee0f160faa	im use to clean carpets for a living i would call a professional company because for one if they don't get the smell out they should redo it two if they damage it they will replace it|`|GSf09ALBaa	I would suggest taking it up and leaving the bare floors.  This is just a personal preference but I haven't had carpet in my homes for over 30 years.  It is a breeding ground for bacteria and gosh knows what else.    If it is heavily soiled then it has gotten all the way to the pad.  You are not going to get that clean.  Rip it up.  And if you do, you will be flabbergasted at what is in your carpet.|`|atX1AurJaa	I used to have this problem and what I did was I went and rented a Rug Doctor steam cleaner (you can also buy a carpet shampooer at Wal-Mart if you think this will be an ongoing problem) and used the steam cleaner shampoo mixed with water and vinegar (or ammonia, if you can stand the smell). The vinegar (or ammonia) neutrallizes the urine smell. It works GREAT!!!|`|y0skiXy2aa	My wife and I have a Carpet cleaner, Get a Bissel Carpet cleaner which will cost you only about $60.00 at walmart, best one weve ever owned and still do. Do not go and waste money on one of those 200-300 dollar ones at walmart they do not work. At least the one my wifes mom had it didnt even suck back up the water that it put out and made the carpet really wet. The bissell one however picks the water and whatever else up, it works wonders!|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	The best thing I've ever done for heavily soiled carpets is rent a professional shampooer from Fred Meyers/Safeway/Walmart or other local stores that rent them out.  THey work famously-- and you should also buy the shampoo/cleaning materials that GO with the machine-- otherwise you may produce too much suds and have a mess on your hands.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I use an enzyme cleaner like Natures Miracle, first (if you have padding, you need to put enough on the carpet to soak down into the urine in the padding.)  Then I steam clean.  I have several indoor dogs, and foster dogs who are not housebroken, so I have gotten rid of most of my carpet, and gone to laminate flooring with throw rugs.  I can machine wash most of my throw rugs, and those that I cant, I can steam clean.  With throw rugs, there is no padding to worry about.|`|CR7xpXPuaa	you have to find something what will neutralize the smell and stain. the only thing I have found that does both of these is this stuff called Nature One. Here is the place i buy it from.    http://www.w4petproducts.com/dog-urine-r...
AE7W7Jspaa	You can purchase a cheap baby gate and either gate the upstairs or a single room for the cats to be able to relax in without fear of harrassment.  When the come into the room be ready to correct and sharp sudden ACCHT and "No Cats" command will help.  You might want to have a spray bottle handy as reenforcement for the verbal correction.  If she persists after the correction a short time out in her crate will help make more of a point.  When I bring a foster in I have one cat that is more than happy to teach Cat Politeness 101, only takes one or two lessons :O)|`|AA10500537	shes only trying to play  leave it alone and they will be friends soon
AA12128656	lacy-  you took on a dog with a behavioral problem, are trying to fix it, and in addition, you are having him neutered! i can't think of a more noble undertaking.     having that been said, anyone who makes a rude comment will be beaten with rotten carrots!!!    ok- so what you need to do with this dog is to NOT let him out of your sight. crate train him.     if you are not physically watching him, into the crate he goes. every time you take him out of the crate, it's right out to potty. then he gets a cookie and some playtime. then you bring him into the house, play 15-20 minutes (or just let him hang out in the same room as you) and then back in the crate he goes. repeat process.    since you are either putting him in the crate or physically watching him, there's very little room for error. success is a better housebreaking tool than corrections. when he potties outside it's the BEST thing that ever happened! he's the BEST dog there ever was!! (when my boy ABPT caught on, he used to poop and then do a happy dance to show me how good he was... boy was that ever cute...)    when he starts to go in front of you, say NO NO NO NO loudly enough to startle him, then right outside and then praise when he finishes outside.    when he has an accident and you didn't see it... oh- wait, that's not gonna happen, right, because you're going to watch him when he's not in the crate!    if he goes in the crate, then the crate is too big.    he's not too old. i took in a rescue pit that had never even walked on grass before (and no pee pads either, she just went wherever!) and had her trained reliably in about a month and a half. it was a LONG month and a half but she ended up to be the best dog i ever had.    don't forget to control the dogs feeding and elimination. what goes in comes out about 15 minutes later.    if you take him out 15 minutes after he eats and he doesn't make a bowel movement, keep walking till he goes. give him the impression that he's not going in till he poops. this will train him to be REAL QUICK when it's cold out!  it sometimes helps to walk back and forth quickly over an area about 15-20 feet. this mimics the pacing dogs do before they potty. worked like a charm for my pups. and as you walk say "go potty" or whatever is your command over and over. pretty soon you'll have him pottying on command!|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	He's not too old to learn. He is actually just past the age of having enough muscle strength to control his elimination so most dogs aren't housebroken at this age anyway.    Crate training is an excellent idea. Place him in the crate anytime you aren't able to keep vigil over him. You are taking him out frequently enough, so keep that up. And, of course, watch for signs that he wants to eliminate, even if he just went half an hour before. The less often he eliminates indoors, the more likely the behavior will be broken.     Regardless of weather, a dog should not be left alone outside when in the process of housebreaking. You need to see what the dog is doing so that you 1) know if he has gone and 2) can praise and reward with a treat right away when he does go.|`|GSf09ALBaa	It is not too late to start 'over' and I commend you for taking this dog and giving it a chance.  I get a very good feeling from you and I can see nothing wrong with what you are doing.    You are a Rescue Angel.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I would try the crate training again. Six months is not very old. I was able to potty train all of mine in a crate. Dogs dont like to use the bathroom where they sleep, and it teaches them to wait until they are taken out.|`|jQglJiMhaa	it is never too late, and people who can't handle with the difficutly that can come from training a pet should never own anything.    when he wakes up, take him outside  When he drinks water, take him outside,  After a meal, take him outside  Before you go to bed, take him out side.    It is 100% being consistant.  if it is not -20 C he can sit outside untill he goes.  or else you might have to get him a sweater, but there is no reason why this dog ins't trainable.  Mabe every 2-3 hours isn't quick enough for him, he's got a tiny little bladder.    You are an incredible person for taking him in, you're friend should give their head a shake|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Without typing it all in again, I am going to go with Frack's steps - this is the method preached by Any positive motivational training course, and exactly the one I'd recommend.    While not impossible, it will be harder, because he has got used to going in the house.     Congrats for taking in the dog - good for you! I'll bet he is a really sweetie, and will grow into a wonderful dog.|`|zSOnXtiQaa	He's not too old, he can still learn! I would agree with you on re-trying the whole thing over. Just take a different approach. Very positive reinforcements will help! treats and praise work best =)|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	TOO OLD?  I thought you said he was 6 months old?  Outdoor dogs that are many YEARS old can learn this.  You said you want to start crate training over.... Does this dog do his business IN the crate?  I can imagine that you are frustrated, but I can't imagine giving up - esp. since you got this dog knowing that he had some difficulty.  Has the dog learned sit, stay, come?  If so, he has the capacity to learn.    Talk to your vet about a possible physical problem and then if you continue to have problems, I would get some advice from professional trainers.  You can probably chat them up and get more advise without having to enter the dog into training and paying a bunch.|`|ldmSmaKqaa	nope never to old to learn put him outdide more often he'll  get the hang of it|`|ldXSIWEyaa	It took me 6 months to get my pom-poo male potty trained. The best advice I can give is let him outside and watch his every move. When he goes pee or poop act like its his birthday lol. It sounds stupid but he will start getting the hang of it. Gives him treats and lots a praise right after he gets done. If he goes in the house, try catching him in the act and do not make a big deal about just put him outside, and do not let him see you clean it up. Make sure you are using a cleaner that erases the smell completely, otherwise he will keep going in the same spot. I am working on training my new puppy, he is 14 weeks and he already stands by the back door to let me know he has to go out, there are a few accidents, but it is expected with puppies. Take him out every 3 hours or so, and start looking for signs that he may want to go out. You may just be missing those signs|`|Mkl0bBmbaa	2-3 hours is not enough to start over it needs to be maybe every hours or so until u know he is holding it longer , and if he dont do both then u know he has to go at some point . limit water two hours  before bed time and crate him at night and also limit water two hours  before you leave the house. if you free feed , food all the time go to like am and pm feeding times like 7 am and 5 pm and a small snack in between .   good luck . I once house broke a chihuahua   who spent the first 6 months of his life in a cage and also i didnt get him house broke until he was 5 years old and use crate training and made my self know what he did and still needed to do out side . never leave the dog out of your site even for a sec , you can leash him to you in the house so he cant wander off to potty .   and its good you go out with him he should never be just left out because you wont know if he went potty .|`|AA10500537	its never to late try the crate training again  dont take the puppy to the pound,|`|2t62ETgEaa	After the neutering, the territorial marking should ease and stop.But you need to clean and deodorize every thing that he has marked, and entire surrounding area, so he and you will have a clean slate to work with..And it's not too late for crate training.you can get a clicker to use with your verbal disapproval when you catch him, and yes use treats when he does his business outside..Good luck..kudos to you for his rescue|`|wdz5RMaeaa	Good for you to care.  (Best book I found: Mother Knows Best: training the way the mother would do.)  **************************************...  Dog is never allowed to make the mistake: !!!!  1. Keep in crate when not under supervision.  2. Take out of crate and keep under supervision for Leash- Walking, or Playing, or Pooping. ONLY these activities. It may seem mean, but it works.   3. When you walk him on leash and the dog won't go, simply stand in one spot and the dog will then only be able to run in circles. This gets things going, and soon the dog will poop.  4. The Alpha- Dog-You is ALWAYS the one in Control. Dog is never even allowed to make the mistake!! Reward only the Desired Behavior. Nothing else.  5. If possible, put in a doggie door and use later when going out for the pooping. Train the dog to use it by putting him through, and of course reward!!  6. Make a clear distinction between REWARDS for good Behavior and no rewards for just nothing.   7. Dog is confused. Start all over.   Good Luck
ldXSIWEyaa	Poms are hard to find cheap because they are a "bred" dog. Look at www.petfinder.com for your local animal shelters, but I doubt you will find one. Please adopt and be open to any breed of dog. Instead of buying, it is a better feeling to rescue!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I agree you should look in the shelters first. You would find great dogs and maybe even cheaper, and the dog will already come spayed or neutered.|`|AA10500537	put an ad in the newspaper or check breeders|`|26PPwzrWaa	A rescue or shelter will be you only hit for 250 to 300.

That is the amount they usually charge for a fully vetted dog. The only pom pup you will find at that price is a one very crappy byb pup.
IrdZKYT3aa	When the babies are free swimming, you can remove the daddy.  He needs to be there until this to make sure they don't sink to the floor and "drown".  It'll take about 24 hrs for the tails to be visible, and then they will begin to fall from the nest and lay on the floor.  Daddy scoops them up and puts them back into the bubble nest until they can swim on their own.  You will need a good supply of food on hand and ready as they begin to freely swim, the first day or so they will feed off their egg sacs and what not so feeding isn't required.  Daphinia, and just hatched brine shrimp are best, as baby betta prefer live food.  Powdered commercial baby powder food is good, but not all will always go for it.  Watch daddy when removed, some males will become "depressed" when removed from the fry.  Keep him warm, if he's hurt, medicated, and add a little aquarium salt to relieve his stress.  Best of Luck!|`|BWCv68QOaa	Breed them...sell them.  Make sure you have over 9,000 of them  Become rich.  Fool proof, really.
I6NwduJPaa	they're used by some people for snake charming, which provides the people with an income, but also, and more importantly, research is being done on their venom , because it has many medical possibilities. http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/... but that's kinda heavy, so just wiki it.    King Cobras are also important and useful because they fulfill a very important role in their ecosystem, helping to keep down rodent and other small animal populations in their habitat. Since rodents can carry lots of nasty diseases, this is a vital role that they play. They also keep down populations of other snake species, even venomous ones!|`|YNusCvP5aa	King Cobras primarily eat other snakes - including other venomous snake species.  It's only in cases of food shortages that they look to birds, lizards and rodents as a food source.    King Cobras are considered a diety in some cultures in India.  Their meat, skin and bile are used in ancient chinese medicine and their venom is used to treat pain and illness.|`|Lv8WlCPTaa	I think that they used to be used for execution.    Their skin is used for clothing for the rich and for decoration.    I'm pretty sure their venom is also used for medicine and antivenom.

49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Yes, valium (aka "diazepam", the generic name) is used for cats.  It's quite inexpensive, just as it is for human beings.  Some vets are a bit hesitant to prescribe it because it tends to interfere to some degree with a cat's ability to regulate its body temperature, and can also potentially pose liver problems.  However, these are rare, and I would certainly take that risk rather than have my cats terrified for a long trip such as you describe.  There are also other mild sedatives that can be given to your cats in such situations.  A typical dose of valium for cats is .5 mg/kg, or .25 mg/pound.  Thus, a 5 pound cat would need a dose of about 1.25 mg; a 10-pound cat would need a dose of about 2.5 mg, and so on.       Note:  The person below me who suggested giving a cat half of a 10 mg tablet is talking about a potential overdose; do NOT give your cats that much!!!!    My cats were given a tiny dose of valium for a trip from Colorado Springs to Seattle, Washington when I moved.  I'm not sure how I'd have made the trip otherwise!  It was really only necessary for the first day (I took it slowly, taking three days to make the trip, which entailed about 20 hours of drive time).  I gave them the medication in the morning before I left, and by the time the dose wore off, they were pretty much sacked out for the day and had realized that they weren't being harmed.      Be sure to give them plenty of water when you stop for the night, and go easy on the food; be sure you have a supply of the food they're used to (which you'd probably do anyway).  I stayed at Motel 6 locations; they're very tolerant of pets (although I didn't exactly mention that I had any; thankfully, cats are quiet... )  My two sailed through like troopers :-)    Talk to your vet, but a word of caution: do NOT let any vet get you to try to attempt to give your cat anything with alcohol in it (for instance, children's benedryl instead).  Cats will NOT tolerate alcohol.|`|PmaB839Naa	There is just a vet and they will tell you all you need to know.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	My vet has prescribed Valium to my cats before. The reason, however, was to act as an appetite stimulant. I didn't actually witness a calming affect BUT maybe it was the dose that was prescribed. I would definitely check with your vet. I'm sure something is available.    I do know there are products available in pet stores that calm your pets but I don't have personal exerience with them and I don't know if it is something that would work in one dose or not.|`|AA11706693	The best thing for you to do is to check with your Vet or local Animal Hospital. Explain the situation to them. They might even sell you some without having to examine the cats. The other alternative is if you know someone who takes Valium is to ask them for 1 pill if its 10mg and break it in half and give each cat half of a half of the pill. That would only be 2 and 1/2 mg per cat and shouldn't do the cats any harm. You could even call a Vet and ask them if they think this is a good idea.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	You can get tablets to calm the cat for the journey you need to go to the vet they will give you the correct dose and also a price.happy moving.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	talk to your vet they do have tranqulizers for cats that can be given.....don't forget to get a copy of all of your pets medical records from the vets office before you leave so you can give them to the new vet when you roll into your new place.
IrdZKYT3aa	What's wrong with it?    A salt dip is a few seconds in a high salt solution and then back into clean water.  This is to help kill surface problems like fin rot, ich and parasites.  This is best as a last resort as it's stressful for the fish and if done improperly, can kill or worsen the fishes condition.  Adding aquarium salt to the tank water can help kill surface issues as well, it's safer and helps relieve stress but slower and less direct.  It helps make the water less hospitable for disease as well and cuts down, but doesn't eliminate, contaminating others.  Best of Luck!|`|VSWl45cKaa	If your fish is ill then I would consult this site so you can decide what you might want to do.     http://thegab.org/Articles/GoldfishIllne...    If in doubt, ask a vet.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	no, its not true - it will kill it. Its not a saltwater fish, its a freshwater fish.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It can cure them of some problems, but not all.    By "salt water," we mean water with a little salt added, not water as salty as sea water.    Salt will kill many external parasites such as ich and velvet. Salt also kills some bacteria and other microbes.    Infestations of hydra in a tank are not as common as they used to be, but salt will also kill hydra.    A small to moderate amount of salt can also help a sick fish recover by reducing its osmotic stress. Osmoregulation for freshwater fish means getting rid of excess water that their bodies constantly absorb, because their bodies are saltier than the surrounding water. If the salt content of the aquarium water is increased, the fish's kidneys do not have to work as hard, and this sometimes helps the immune response of weak fish.    It is not a good idea, though, to routinely add salt to the water in a freshwater fish tank. Like other medicines, salt should only be used as a specific treatment for a specific problem.|`|OsVswissaa	You'll probably get a lot of conflictin answers.  Goldfish  are freshwater fish.  Saltwater will irritate their scales and interfere with the slime coat.  Also keep in mind, a concentration of salt that would kill disease or fungus would also seriously harm a fish.  Salt is not medicine.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	A salt dip can be used to cure some diseases, mostly fungal or bacterial infections. The fish is put in a bowl of salted water, just for a few minutes and hopefully the salt kills the infection and not the fish. Of course leaving the goldfish in salt water too long will kill it.    However it's probably better to treat with proper antibiotics, and it wont cure all the possible problems. So it's important to find out exactly what is wrong with your fish before you try and treat it.    Ian|`|TqIdbEBPaa	as long as its not too much saltwater    -i mean too strong like 1 tespoon per gallon of tank water is good and only if the sick fish is sick with parasites|`|5o1C6G93aa	i don't think i'd risk it|`|7e0MOQFWaa	can you tell us what is up with your fish or its symptoms or something coz i realy want to help but i am finding it difficult with the lack of info.|`|NoOM7eZnaa	A salt bath is a complex process and is highly debated by aquarists. Basically, you want 0.001-0.003ppm of salt in your freshwater tank. So, 1 teaspoon per gallon (for 0.001) or 1 tablespoon per gallon (for 0.003).What this does, is it kills any harmful bacteria on and inside the fish (since the water is traveling through the fish, not just around it). It WILL be somewhat harmful to the fish. HOWEVER: It will be LESS harmful than letting the bacteria take it's course.|`|dbZvPW3Haa	1 of my goldfish is 11 years old and when he was ill a few times I would put him in saltwater for 30 mins one day and the next if no better he always came around, the last one we had was nearly 14 years my father was a fisherman and suggested this and it worked but not too much salt.

VDP3pNCPaa	Here is a response, and I have given the link:    Boarding your FIV cat  Boarding catteries should have no problem accepting an FIV cat, since the virus cannot be transmitted by feeding equipment etc. although you should make them aware of the cat's condition. The cattery will need to know this, to ensure that they are not allowed contact with other cats, and also so that they can keep a close eye for any symptoms of illness, and act promptly.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	Even if she can be boarded, you might want to compare the cost of an at home pet service compared to the cattery.  They are usually cheaper, and your cat will experience far less stress if she can be left at home.  The pet services in my area will stop by once or twice day, bring in mail, and water plants (your choice of service).|`|NdKuSlVsaa	You would have to ask them before taking your cat there. FIV is transmittable by saliva and body fluids, so your cat would have to be quarantined, with their own food and water and no contact with the other cats.    Why don't you try and see if a friend (who doesn't have cats) can take care of your cat? That way you don't have to worry about your cat being alone, and there's no chance of another kitty getting sick :)|`|gasBBNzCaa	it can be, but I think a lot of places wouldn't keep your cat just to be on the safe side.  If another cat got infected, it would be their fault for letting the infected cat be around infection free cats.
iVQULHqYaa	.Puppies are excitable, lovable hooligans. They have bursts of unbelievable energy, however in order to grow they need lots of sleep. New puppies need a room where they can rest and sleep and the other dogs in the house need respite. Older dogs dont want puppies biting their ears and chewing their necks, if a puppy does this, the older dogs should be allowed to chastise the puppy. How would you cope if you were expected to cope with an unruly toddler twenty four hours a day? Would you be annoyed, if you had a toddler thrust upon you who pulled your hair and poked your eyes? I am sure that you would grumble.    Please dont expect your dog to cope with an unruly puppy and to baby-sit twenty four hours a day.  Supervise them for SHORT play sessions in the garden and if the puppy is over exuberant, allow your dog to chastise it, then put your puppy in its own room to rest. Dont expect your dog to want to sleep with your puppy or to play with it constantly.     Your puppy will possibly need about four meals a day. Divide your other dogs rations into four and feed it (or them) when you feed your puppy.  Give your existing dog extra attention when the puppy is resting and make him feels special.    There will be visitors, who want to see your puppy. When the doorbells rings, put your puppy into another room and tell your visitors to fuss your adult dog or dogs and give them treats BEFORE they make a fuss of the puppy.    Older dogs love puppies, with the proviso that YOU stop the puppy from being a pain in the bum. They dont want a puppy being thrust upon them all of the time. If you do this any dog will object and be confused.|`|PM23RDycaa	Leave them be. IF the pup was being too aggressive with the older dog your 1yr would put him in his place. Since that is not happening, just let them play. Pups have sharp teeth and as long as the bites aren't serious or free flowing just wipe his face down and go on with your day.    They are getting along. Keep an eye on them of course but otherwise let them play.  Your older dog is also still young enough to be tolerant of the pups antics.|`|3giaPYe8aa	OK, so the pup is playing rough with the old one.  BIG DEAL!  This is what puppies do.  If the older Bulldog is bothered enough, he/she will snap back and put the pup in it's place.  They are enjoying themselves, so let them play.  You are going to do more harm by separating  them, than letting them work things out.  Let them figure out the "pecking order."|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	The dogs should figure out for themselves who the leader between the two of them are. I'd let them hash it out but keep a close eye just in case the older one is just going to let the little one dominate.|`|AA10500537	let them play a bit each day  then gradually they will learn to get along.|`|l8Q3n8WUaa	Puppies tend to be very very playful when they are still at that age, its like they are trying to explore they don't know whether they are doing something good or bad. The only time u should separate them is when the older dog is getting bored n doesn't want to play anymore u should be able to notice, but as far as the puppy being aggressive he shouldn't be i mean bulldogs are such friendly dogs!! good luck with ur dogs! =]|`|E6nGIy89aa	Ive got a little bulldog puppy myself, and by god their teeth are sharp! I bet hes cut you every now and then when hes playing.  Don't worry, the damage is purely because his teeth are sharp, this will change when he develops his adult teeth.  As for playing rough, your older dog will soon tell your puppy when he is crossing the line. pups learn really well from other dogs about bite pressure,sensitive areas and manners. your pup will soon learn, don't worry  don't worry about letting your older on rough him up a little bit, that will be how he learns  good luck ^_^  Great breed arnt they !
520ea06a8f049bc8c3f4aa42693181d7aa	Five or six is a respectable age for a budge, she could just be getting old.  I would try increasing her vitamin supplements   ie more charcoal, oyster shell grit and dry seaweed powder  you could also try some tonic seed  hope this helps!|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	By any chance is it a round-walled cage rather than rectangular?  Apparently parrots don't do well in round cages...it gives them a sense of disorientation and anxiety, which might be making her a little exhausted.    Is she puffed up more than normal?  Or sitting on the floor of the cage at all?  If so, she is probably quite sick and needs to see a vet right away.  Parrots are instinctively terrified of being left behind by their flock, so if they are sick they will "buck up" and try to look normal until it's too late to do anything for them.      Budgies in particular are susceptible to fatty tumors through bad breeding over the years.  They aren't cancerous, but as they grow they interfere with the internal organs.  A vet can rule this out for you.|`|2ZqKDMMRaa	Have you left the gas oven on...|`|DunU13FNaa	I think your bird needs a little more excitement in her life.

She could have one of many illnesses.  There are many pet birds that are older that are active and healthy.  Her sleeping alot doesn't have anything to do with her age.|`|vwC7klVVaa	You haven't said if she is eating and drinking ok. I would suggest it might be a good idea to get her check out by your vet and if he says she is ok i would also suggest getting her a friend as budgies like company of there own kind and it might give her a new least on life.|`|ih1aamMJaa	How much sleep is she getting at night? Do you cover her cage? Is she in a room where there is a lot of activity at night? Birds require about fourteen hours of sleep. She is getting older as well. If she is too cold at night she may not be sleeping well. If you don't want to raise the temperature in your home, try getting a ceramic heat lamp like the type used for reptiles and attach it to the outside of her cage so she can feel the radient heat from it. Good Luck with her.  Margaret
X8kLuVMmaa	I had this same problem with my bulldog.  I asked a trainer what to do and she suggested a harness called an EasyWalk harness.  I bought it at Petsmart that day and it has changed our walks completely!  It has a loop in the front that you attach your lead to (most harnesses attach to the lead from the back -- this actually encourages pulling).  With the attachment on the front the dog cannot pull.  If your dog tries to pull, he or she just gets turned around instead.  Collars can injure your dog's trachea if she is pulling to hard -- this harness is a gentle way to end pulling once and for all.  Now my dog walks by my side and never ever pulls.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	First of all, your walk starts BEFORE you leave the house.  You need to make sure that your dogs are calm, and make them wait for you to tell them its okay to go through the door.  Just because a door is open, that doesnt mean they are allowed go through it. (Practicing this will also keep your dogs from slipping out the door when they are not on a leash.)  Your dogs should not go out ahead of you.  If they try, block them with your foot, and make them sit until you say its okay to go.    Then, when you are walking, if your dog gets ahead of you, give your dog a short, sideways tug into the position where you want him to walk (beside you).  Make sure that when the dog is where you want him to be there is no pressure on the leash. That teaches the dog that the most comfortable place to be is beside you.  If you do this consistently, your dog will learn to walk beside you with a loose leash.    You should train both your dogs this way, and then you can walk them together (I walk four dogs at a time this way.)|`|uhmWX5Qkaa	get a harness AMD practise in the garden for her to heal. Practise ALL the time and you'll get it. Hold the lead closly to you so she cant pull far.|`|XHp9G799aa	a body harness worked wonders for my doberman! or try a choke coller but the harness i find is better,good luck x|`|cjtqklPlaa	Try this it worked for me put your leash on your dog then put the leash around your dog but in front of his  back paws so when the dog pulls it pinches them.
HkMhWvtgaa	This is the sort of situation in which some people say, "Oh, those poor cats!"  Much as I love cats, I'm saying, "Your poor cousin!"    "Collecting" pets to this degree is almost always a sign of serious mental illness, and the fact that you mention your cousin is "crazy" makes me think that it is not the only symptom you have noticed.    If she is in the care of a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, then you should contact them and tell them what you have noticed.  If she is not, then I think you should call the state office of mental health at 1-800-597-8481 (toll-free).  You can find out more about this agency on their website, http://www.omh.state.ny.us/    Calling animal control will take care of this batch of cats, but believe me, it will not solve your cousin's problem.  Before long, she'll probably have acquired just as many new cats, or she will have moved on to some other unhealthy behavior, possibly one even more destructive.  Also, no matter what you say to her, you will not convince her to "get down for real", because her perception of reality is different from yours.  She needs professional help for a long-term solution.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Contact the local animal control and tell them that you are concerned about the health & well being of the cats. Request that they go by and investigate the situation themselves, as you feel like it has become a ''hoarder'' situation.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	paintedrain2 is correct.    they deal with this all the time, they usually try to work with the people to convince them to surrender the animals, only seizing the animals and arresting the homeowner when they refuse to cooperate. even when arrested, it is done to get the people help, not to punish.    no one likes to call in the cops, but you will be doing her and the cats a big favor.|`|AA11828240	Help her out and offer to call vets in the area to find out how much it would cost to spay/neuter them, see if she can work out a special price/payment plan.  If she has the room on/in her property and the money to keep them all fed and their litter clean, then give her love and support, and see if she'd be willing to put some of them up for adoption.  You might even be able to persuade her into getting herself made into a "No Kill cat shelter."  Go after the subject carefully, if you're overly critical of it/her, she might get defensive and all you'll succeed in doing is to alienate her and drive her away.    Good luck!|`|AxeOdUFQaa	You are right that is crazy. I would go and talk to her, see if you can convince her to give some away. You can even offer to take a few (if you don' want them you can just give those away). But speak to her niceley just say that it is a lot of money to take care of 20 cats and say that you are worried about her.|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	Contrary to what others say, I doubt that there is anything you can do. If an adult wants to house 20 cats, that's the person's business, not the government's. But if this person is truly "crazy," she may need mental health assistance.     Take care of the human's needs first. The cats may be only a symptom.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	You need to get the animal control to go out there if she won,t listen to you then they can force the law i know that sounds bad but 20cats are not healthy for her and the cats will be getting ill and they will be breeding like mad you need to phone soon.
IrdZKYT3aa	Definitely remove him, especially if others are attacking him.  Betta should not be housed with aggressive or fin nipping fish.  The fact that he still has a white spot means he's still contagious and able to re infect the tank all over again.  Separate him, get his temp up to about 84-86, gradually or he'll be shocked, and medicate him.  You're basically inducing a fever in him to help fight off the illness.  Betta can TOLERATE cold water, they don't WANT to be cold; and just like us, being  too cold for too long can lead to disease and death.    In a small bowl be careful how much you use of the meds as over medicating can worsen the situation.  Also, try adding some aquarium salt, this helps relieve the fishes stress and makes the water less hospitable for bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.  Salt and heat treatments have been very successful in treating betta.  Watch his fins, they're like open wounds now, infection can set in easily.  Perform regular water changes as, just like us, an open wound must be kept clean.  Our "dressings" are their water.  Best of Luck!|`|7HxJvbjMaa	You can buy a tank divider for pretty cheap. It's a plastic sheet with tiny holes so you can keep fish apart... great to have on hand if you have a sick fish or fry.   Normally Betta's would do fine in an unheated bowl but this guy is sick and injured. He would do best in his regular tank. If you move him I don't think he will make it. You should buy the tank divider.|`|3n60UxgQaa	Well, the bigger than tank or bowl in this case, the better.    It's best to get a heater for him or at least put him in a place that's relatively warm.    Since the others are picking on him, there's really no choice but to take him out in this stage and treat him.  The reason he's probably not getting better is because of the stress that's he in.  Since he's getting picked on, he can't concentrate on recovering since he's probably always trying to get away.    So, yes, remove him, even if it means putting him in a temporary bowl.|`|tTsMMhCaaa	Take your fish out and put him in a temporary bowl. If you keep him in there for too long, he'll probably infect the others. And yes, the fish can stay in cold water without a filter. I do this with my fish. So your fish doesn't get bored, I like putting a swim-through tiki head. Hope this helps!|`|7uHdD5ULaa	It sounds like the fish is getting bullied...  I would take it out and put it in a different bowl...|`|OsVswissaa	It's a catch-22.  If the other fish seem recovered and they're nipping his fins he should be moved for sure.  But.   Although he might survive in cold water(no filter is okay as long as you do 100% water changes) it certainly won't help his recovery, in fact it could weaken him(but if you're talking about ich, cold water is bad for that).  He might not get bored while he's sick, but he would want a plant or tunnel in with him to hide in.|`|DXvsemWtaa	put a plug in the sink and then put some bugspray in the sink then run some hot water and put the fishy poop poop in the sink and it will alll be better!
iXijnCxOaa	In inbreeding like this drastically increases the risk for genetic issues to be expressed.  Which means that if these dogs are carriers (not affected) of something like juvenile cataracts you increase the risk of it showing up.    Inbreeding should only be done by breeders with a tremendous amount of information regarding what the line has for genetic issues (as well as what it doesn't have).    It is very very risky if you don't know what you are doing.|`|jQglJiMhaa	god i hope you aren't planning on breeding ever    No you can't|`|kqa9VFrfaa	It is called "line breeding" and is fine as long as U know what U R doing. But if U do not know what U R doing forget it. Depending on the breed, and what your purpose is makes a lot of difference. If U R doing this just because these happen to be the only two animals U have, them U are a dimwit. If U R breeding show dogs, then U wouldn't be asking this question.   This whole purpose of line breeding is to "fix" a certain trait in that line of dogs. If U have no specific purpose in mind, then U should not even be breeding dogs at all. The world is too full of unwanted puppies. Just check out any dog pound in the USA and U will see what I mean.  Your chances of deformities depends directly on close these dogs are genetically in the last 4 generations on a pedigree. If the mothers are not related at all, AND not related to the sire, then the pups will be fine. However if either one of the females is related to the male, I would NOT recommend what U R doing.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Why are you asking the question?

That's not to say it can't be done, but the dedicated breeder would have to be sure of what was there in the bloodline and be willing to deal with the culls.  In some cases of species recovery there's been no choice; the redwolf was down to 14 individuals when they were taken into the recovery program, and some sibling breeding was inevitable.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	I think some of these people's answers are unnecessarily mean.  It's ok to ask a question. That is how you learn.  Only thing i'd like to add is:  I cannot support Breeders because millions of dogs and cats have to be put to sleep every year, because they are not wanted.  That is so terribly sad, i don't know how anyone could be careless and want to make money breeding more puppies and kittens.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	Line breeding is usually handled by professional kennels willing to deal with culls due to deformities and related problems.

It does increase the risk of genetic diseases becoming more ingrained in the line.  But the dogs don't end up with two heads and six feet.      So the answer is, Yes, you can breed relative together.  But it isn't wise unless you are sure they are free of genetic diseases such as dysplasias, luxations, thyroid disease, etc.  And even if the dogs don't have those problems, you also have to make sure they don't carry a gene for them.      But, No, you won't end up with deformed animals. It just increases the risk of passing on a genetic issue.
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	STOP feeding milk to the pups. Guinea pigs are strict herbivores. They cannot digest dairy products. The milk they would have received from their mum is not like cow milk or commercially prepared formulas for orphaned cats or dogs.    Put them in with your other sow. That is the best chance they have of getting any milk. Feed them pellets, alfalfa hay, and fresh dark green veggies like Romaine lettuce, parsley, or spinach. Also give them slices of tomatoes and bell peppers.    To answer your question, the pups are usually weaned at around 3 weeks. Any male pups will need to be separated from any female pups at this time or you risk pregnancy again.|`|uDQmkdouaa	try only putting a few piggies in with the mom at a time.... only she can give them the right type of nutience.     good luck! =) =)|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	first, ur guinea pig died because giving birth to 4 pups. normal guinea pigs only give birthd 2-3 litters.    is the milk for guinea pigs?i presume you're feeding them human milk. it's useless, its like giving them water. maybe you are feeding them too much.    hey! to tell you alalfa fay is not edible for them!it's good for nesting but not for feeding! its just the pet shop wanna have some money. and why feed them cellery and pellets! they are just new borns! get some rodent/guinea pigs formulated milks and thats what you feed them.    after a week, get a fresh, tall, greeny grass. make sure that the grass looks like smooth and no obvious sign of poison (bitter taste), dont have torny sides and some kinda defense.    or you could also get a surrogate mother for them. find a guinea pig that has already isolated from its pups. then place them to the new borns. remember, it is the mother you will put into the pups.
IrdZKYT3aa	Rainbow fish can be very striking, as well as gourami for big flashy fish.  For schooling you could try tetra or guppies, but I wouldn't mix them as tetra are known fin nippers and may harm the male guppies.  I'd also get some more cory cats and rasbora as both would like some family : )|`|kTyc7HhUaa	Discus fish are really beautiful and great community fish. They are kinda expensive, but they are a joy to keep. They prefer softer water  but they can tolerate other conditions. They can be with tertas or rasboras.

j3bE41RNaa	Birds do take more effort than you think. I work at a Pet Store and birds DO carry disease very easily. Although if you are a bird lover then I say take the steps to let her know you are serious.   Think of the bird you really want and research what it needs. Research how to take care of it from what to feed it to how to clean its cage.   Research what diseases the bird can carry and how it is as far as being a first pet. It is very easy to find research.   I insist that you go into a pet store and ask for more information.   I work at PetSmart and I know we carry books and stuff, and even free booklets on what you need for your a certain type of animal.     Once you have everything you need and you know exactly what it takes, tell your mom about your research and it might make her more interested in giving you the such responsibility|`|4Ja1XNAlaa	yeah it could really give you asma because of its feathers..

Like dusty air would make you have a coughing attack which would trigger your asthma to act up.    As for the bird...have you asked her why she won't let you?  Sit down maturely with her, don't cry, and ask her what the reason is.  Maybe she thinks birds are loud and annoying but will let you get a hamster.  Or maybe she doesn't think you are responsible enough yet and wants you to show her responsibility (taking out the trash every day, etc.).  Good luck.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	Birds do not make good pets, they are very messy and bird feces carries alot of disease, and they are noisy.   why not get a birdfeeder and place it outside your window?
2YIxnXXyaa	By your typing skills, I assume you're about 10-13.  Perhaps you shouldn't have a bird if your mom knows you don't need one.    Try to see if you can work your way up to a bird.  Get a fish and if you can keep it alive, try going up a step to a mouse, hamster, gerbil or rat, and if you can keep that alive, try a parakeet.  Hope that works.    I would totally work on your grammar though, it makes it difficult to understand how you're saying what you're saying.    Good luck with your bird havings.
lG6TWd0waa	having your pets teeth cleaned is very important.  they feel like a million bux once done.  my cat, as we speak, is getting his done today (unfortunately, he had to have some extractions, he has bad teeth) but im sure will be greatful after, cos his mouth will no longer hurt.  im a vet' tech and the benefits of clean mouth are essential to pet health.  bad teeth can lead to a lot of problems....studies have been shown that there has been a connection with bad teeth and heart disease (in both pets and humans).  the average price of a pet dental, at least at our place is 500-600 bucks.  but the main bulk of that is a good animal hospital will put the pet on iv fluids while under anesthesia to make sure the pet is the best state possible for the procedure.  you can do home care for your dog too....they have pet toothpaste and pet toothbrushes (u can get them at your local vet, i know we sell them) and u can brush your dogs teeth daily, it can become tedious tho'.  they aslo have prescription dry dog and cat foods called t/d its made by the Hill's company....these kibbles are ginormous in size and are designed to be big so whent he animal bites down on it, it cracks down the center and becomes somewhat abrasive to the tooth, wiping off any tartar or buildup.  any other questions feel free to email  me....surfkitten79@aol.com  good luck.|`|m5KMqkY2aa	I usually brush my dogs teeth every other day, give him chew toys, and those tug-o-war ropes (they're like flossing when they chew on them), his teeth are great so far (he's only 4).   When my moms dog got older, he developed horrid bad breath, and took him to get his teeth cleaned at the vet, which totally helped the bad breath. It usually costs from 100-200 bucks depending on how much your vet charges, but it just all depends on the vet.|`|ZaPFztGJaa	After the tarter build up has been scraped off you can maintain your dogs teeth with a toddler tooth brush. Once a week or once every other day, depending on what you can manage.|`|AA12322387	Do not use human toothpaste.  They make special paste specifically for dogs and also special brushes with different choices in styles.    To have their teeth cleaned by a vet can be costly.  It depends on the condition of the teeth.  I would guesstimate around $200..that is if there are no issues.  Of course the dog will have to be put under anesthesia to do this.    You should try to get into the habit of brushing your dogs teeth at home.  If the teeth are really bad, a vet is the only way to go.      I brush my terriers teeth at home and the groomer brushes them as well ($5).  I try to do maintenance at home so that I don't have to have him put to sleep to have his teeth cleaned.    And his teeth are in great shape I might add.  Dogs teeth are no different than ours and should be brushed daily.  I'm guilty though..mine gets brushed about once a month..maybe twice.|`|2fb47d9f780ad38758b903b84af1726eaa	i was told i needed to get my 8 y/o pomerianans teeth done, they told me it would be about $250. i started to brush his teeth with dog toothpaste, easily bought at target or walmart, and i would also give him a greenie every other night, easily bought at target or larger name pet stores like petco. I just had him into the vet and they said his teeth are looking good and he doesn't need them cleaned. the plus to this way is its a ton cheaper and if they have bad breath, this helps a lot!!!|`|r782jijgaa	I by greenies.  They are treats that your dog will eat.  Dogs love them.  They help keep there teeth clean and breath fresh.  You can by them at Petsmart, Petco or even Walmart.

That is definitely something you do not want to put off.|`|pt4FuXddaa	yeah,bring your boston terrier to petco or petsmart they might have a specially designed toothbrush and toothpaste for your bostie if not try going online when you bring him to the vet ask for it maybe he or she has some spares also while your at it ask your vet for a special brand of dog treat that is soft and safe for your bostie and other recommended this can be used to help with his teeth!just because he went to the vet you can't be worryless about dental promblesm try home treatments!don't orry the tooth paste is beef flavor!!|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	dog tooth past and a tooth brush. they also have treats that can be helpful.|`|AA12128656	i don't know the cost, but if it's for tartar, then the vet needs to put the dog under and scrape it off. the good news, is that after that's done you can avoid having to do it again by giving your dog raw bones (big ones he can't swallow) and brushing his teeth regularly.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Well i do something thats very crazy with my dog. And im sure im going to get alot of Thumbs down for this. With my dog Mr. Mustard, I put a ball in his mouth, so i have full access to all of his teeth, and i take a small knife, and scrape the tarter off of his teeth. Then i brush his teeth with dog toothpaste. His teeth before i did them myself were full of tarter, and now, they look perfect, white, and polished. Im extremely precise, and careful when i scrape his teeth, and im lucky to have a dog that is very mellow, and patient enough, to sit through the whole thing. I do this at least once a week every time i groom him, or once a month|`|GSf09ALBaa	It's expensive but don't put it off.  My 14 year old Dachshund still has almost all of his teeth because he received regular dental care from the time I adopted him at 8 years.

When camping a bear was out during the day and stupid campers were throwing food to it. My brother and I had ice creams, so when the bear saw we had food he started coming towards us! Tinkerbell saw what was happening and i kid you not broke through the screen of our motor home and came running towards the bear and got right up into it's face barking at it!!!!    AND SHE LIVED TO TELL THE TALE!     
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	One gallon = 231 cubic inches, so your tank's capacity in inches is:  30 x 18 x 18 = 9720 cu. in.  9720 divided by 231 = 42.0779...  So your tank holds 42 U.S. gallons.  To convert to liters, multiply gallons by 3.8.  42.0779 x 3.8 = 159.89610, which we can round to 160 liters.  So the tank is 42 gallons, which is 160 liters.|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Here try this tool!|`|NzSA6dmyaa	33.66 US gallons   28.03 UK gallons   127.43 litres|`|dcJe7ovOaa	agree with J C

It could have been done between her vet and the store vet - and frankly regardless of whether he was on a retainer for the store, he would surely be bound by his governing body first (unless his income from being retained by the store was sufficient to keep him in business?!!)    Frankly I don't think she has a leg to stand on, other than getting a written report from the medical records taken by the vet who was treating the puppy which I guess the Courts might take into consideration?  Depends on how the law works where you are.  I do think this case should be pursued, if only to publicize the activities of this pet shop!!!!    Salutary lesson however - buy from a reputable breeder!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	sue him and report him to animal control as what he has done is illegal and he has probably bought them from either a backyard breeder or a puppy farm|`|JwYwsrTzaa	As a dog owner, I would have never bought a dog from a pet store. There is nothing she can do. The manager told her to come in and see their vet, she refused to. The store can argue that their vet could have diagnosed the problem and been able to treat it. The only thing she can do is pay her bills so the vet she did go to doesn't come after her.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	In the UK, the usual recommendation in these cases is to take it to Trading Standards, as the Pet store could be done for selling you "faulty goods".

You could also contact local animal control or similar.|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	Important lesson: never, ever, buy any puppy from a pet shop.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	No health guarantee?  Friend is outta luck.

If she didn't take it back and chose to do what she did with the vets then SHE is responsible for the bills incurred.    As for the puppy dying then that will go back on the pet store and the breeder.  She should be able to receive either compensation as in a refund on the purchase price or a puppy in return.|`|zZZnQuQJaa	If she refused to take the puppy to Pet Store's Vet, then there is absolutely nothing she can do.  If she reads her paperwork carefully, not taking the pup to that vet voids her health guarantee.     As a dog owner what would I do?  Well, I would have never bought a Puppy Mill pup from a Pet Store in the first place.  In your friend's case, all she can do is chalk it up to a lesson learned and find a reputable, responsible breeder to buy her next puppy from.
AA12128656	spay both of them and train them VERY WELL.  the better they are trained, the less likely they are to fight (or to listen to you when you tell them NO when they look like they will.)  since you are raising them together, you can make sure that there is a defined pack order.    it's all about training!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	You should establish which one is the alpha. If they are the same age, arrived at home together, are from the same litter, then you should watch their behaviour. You will most probably be able to tell which one is the more dominant.  If the above is not the case, then normally the one that were first in your household will be the alpha, or the older one.  That established, you should treat the alpha as the alpha. Her bowl of food should always be put down first. She should always be greeted first, trained first, play ball first. In everything that dominant one should always be first. I have two females and two male dogs at my home and not one day had they fight. Be consistent with that, do not feel sorry for the other one.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	socialization is the answer.

ur5wDhkMaa	It needs a heater and the water has to be clean so it needs good filtration. A light would be useful if you want to see them. Soft lighting works best, they will hide from bright light.    I've got Japonica/Amano and though they have other hiding places they prefer to hang out on a bit of bogwood. Saying that they are crustaceans and their shells need calcium, so the PH should be up side of 7.0    They are excellent tank cleaners, but in a species only don't overfeed, as they won't tolerate an ammonia spike.    You might consider bringing them on in your 17 litre and transferring to the larger tank when they aren't on the menu.    Shrimps do most of their shrimping, when the lights are out, so don't expect to see them often :o)|`|6KsGSDh5aa	Shrimp should have a heater and a filter but a sponge filter would be recommended or a small hang on the back with a piece of nylon stocking over the uplift tube so tiny shrimp don't get sucked in.  The light is only for your purpose and they do not need one.    Shrimp love algae pellets, cucumbers and zucchini.
uXYt67X9aa	My 10 year old cat had a similar set of circumstances, but his bad root wasn't spotted by the vet for almost a year, he was in terrible pain and yes, the vet prescribed Metacam and a kind of antidepressant that gave him an appetite (he was on hunger strike because of the pain in his mouth, very depressed, moody and always cold). We spent over 1000 on dentistry for him, prescription fees, x-rays, vitamin shots, anything and everything to get a dianosis for his pain.     Eventually I changed vets in desperation and my new vet, Neil, spotted the problem straight away. The previous vet had removed all his back teeth searching for the source of his pain, but had left one root in that had cracked and gone bad. Neil whipped that crushed root out. Beau was instantly so much better, we felt like a miracle had happened. Beau now eats perfectly well with only his tiny front teeth and fangs.   He had little holes in his gum where the tooth had vacated and you need to make sure bits of food don't get in and go bad, your vet will talk you through how to check.    While Beau was on the Metacam, he was constipated. We supplemented his diet with special formula cat milk (all the supermarkets supply their own, or Whiskas and Felix do a branded version), this helped to keep his bowels moving comfortably, and kept his strength up a bit.    I think this may be your cat's bowel problem, but you should mention the problem to your vet - and if you can, get a sample of (fresh) poop and the blood to show him, sorry it's a bit gross but if you want an accurate diagnosis this is the only way.     Prayers for your little one, I'm sure he'll be just fine.    Bitz|`|iDxoM3X8aa	it sounds like he has pain if he has changed this much.i think once he has been back to the vet and gets home he will be back to his old self keep him quiet until he goes to the vet so he does not get to grumpy with anyone hope he gets on well|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it's the pain causing him to act that way don't worry he well be just fine|`|PP8tKxYdaa	he will be finee hes just in pain|`|6puzMUP1aa	what exactly does dabbed mean? he will be fine after the roots are taken out.|`|dU7K1OIIaa	If the vet isn't worried about the blood, then you shouldn't be. If he is in pain you can excuse him for being a little short tempered most animals are. Small animals such as cats and toy breeds of dogs do handle anaesthetic much more easily than bigger animals so i'm sure there is nothing to worry bout, it seems to be a straight forward operation. let me know how he gets on|`|XYH2tM2Eaa	The blood is not good I can tell you that much... but I don't think you should be going to that vet.... Because I don't think any animal is supposed to have all their teeth pulled..... Just because of gingivitis? There are simple cures for gingivitis.... Go to a different vet.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You were quite right to have his teeth extracted if they were causing pain.  Hopefully after his next op he will be feeling much better.  There is no doubt that his pain is making him cranky and the stress that he is feeling could have brought on a bout of colitis which would account for the poo with blood in it (was it bright red blood?).      As for the Metacam.  After he has had his operation please try to stop it as soon as possible.  It is a very good pain killer but was originally designed for dogs and as a "one off" treatment rather than an ongoing one.  Prolonged use of it can cause a build up of toxins in the kidneys so it is best to stop it as soon as he is feeling better - you could gradually decrease the amount to just a few drops and see how he does.  You could discuss the possibility of putting him on a low dose of steroids for the pain instead of the Metacam - either Prednisolone or Dexamethasone - which will also help with the colitis.      Good luck.    Edit - You are almost certainly looking at a dose of colitis.  The fact that his temperament has changed indicates that he is stressed by the pain and is redirecting his aggression (unfortunately for your son!),  Let him be as quiet as possible until you take him for his op and try not to overhandle him as colitis can cause him to have a sensitive tummy.    Another possibility for the pooing on the floor and the blood could be constipation (possibly attributed to his medication).  The blood vessels around the anus can easily rupture whilst straining and this would also account for bright red blood.  It would also explain why he went on the floor instead of using his litter tray or gone outside - he would be associating either of them with the pain of trying to use his bowels.  Also, strangely enough, constipation can sometimes lead to diarrhoea and he might not have had sufficient time to get to his litter tray.|`|089fc69ee0731b62401c891ee082f824aa	animals are just like ppl if they feel  hurt or in pain they can sometimes lash out at things and ppl. i thinkn after the op your puddy cat might feel like its old self again...if it continues then i would ask the vet about it.  hope your cat is ok..|`|MPCfQuT5aa	He is probably bad tempered because of the pain. However I would be concerned about blood in his faeces, this is definitely abnormal and if I were you I'd mention it again when he goes back for his next op. If he uses a litter tray you will be able to see if this happens again.

lLnpwN6Yaa	En primer lugar debes evitar provocar un ataque, no mires a los ojos fijamente a los perros desconocidos ni les acaricies poniendo la mano sobre la cabeza, esto es un gesto de dominancia que no toleraran.  Tambin evita convertirte en presa, esto es, no corras (a menos que ests seguro de que seras mas rpido o tienes un carro, un rbol o una puerta muy cerca donde meterte, subirte o esconderte.  Si el ataque es inminente y el perro es de gran porte cuando mas te defiendas mas estimularas la agresividad del perro, la caza y la pelea cesan cuando cesa la lucha, no te muevas hasta que cese el ataque o el perro haya sido controlado.  Ojala los propietarios fueran mas concientes de lo peligroso que es dejar a su perro sin el correcto control, se evitara que luego que las personas y dems animales atacados y estos pobres perros sin guia paguen las consecuencias.

Antes que nada si te topas con un perro que pararece dispuesto a atacarte, no corras, si lo haces lo unico que provocaras es que el perro te persiga y eso despertaria su instinto de depredador y tu serias su presa, no lo mires a los ojos, esto los perros lo toman como un desafio, sobre todo los perros dominantes, lo mejor seria que retiraras tu mirada, pero no pierdas un solo movimiento suyo, jamas le des la espalda, si lo tienes enfrente, agacha la cabeza, comunicandole sumision, y que no es tu intencion pelear con el, con paso lento camina hacia atras sin dar la espalda al perro y sin sostenerle la mirada, si te es posible vence el miedo y agachate a su altura y agacha la cabeza, el perro no te atacara, esto para ellos significa  no quiero pelear sobre todo con un perro dominante.   Los perros evitan las peleas si es posible, asi que si no lo provocas no te atacara.Aveces los perros comunican su descontento metiendo la cola entre las patas, agachando las orejas y gru?endo o incluso mostrando los dientes, todo esto lo hacen para evitar una pelea, si no lo comprende su contrincante entonces atacaran.|`|uWhoWn3Naa	hola!!!    1.- quedate quieta sea el perro q sea no lo mires a los ojos eso quiere decir q bajes tu cabeza  el perro es un animal territorial  esto hace q si el siente peligro sobre su terreno te pueda atacar....    2 si se te hacerca estira tu mano con la palma hacia abajo no le temas solo te olera  aun q ladre al final solo se ira    3.- camina dos o tres pasos hacia atras antes de darle la espalda     4.- si  a un perro no le causas peligro el nunca te mordera a menos q este sea demaciado manoso  o lo tengan muy mal entrenado|`|JeFBXePZaa	pegale un pu?etazo bien fuerte en su nuca y en su osico.|`|Ni1CsOy8aa	todos te dan consejo por si te ataca a ti pero y si ve s el ataque?

Lo primero es pensar por qu te ataca. Si se ha asustado por algo, o si le duele algo, o si tiene algn problema en la cabeza (pueden causar da?os cerebrales algunos virus y actuar como la epilepsia, con ataques y alucinaciones). EN estos casos, cuanto ms corras mejor.    Pero si el perro te ataca por su mala educacin (culpa del "due?o" por llamarlo de alguna manera), no puedes dejar que vea que le tienes miedo. Hirguet ante l y evita por todos los medios que te alcance el cuello o que haga presa con los dientes en alguna parte de tu cuerpo, especialmente la cara y el cuello. Si es necesario, encgete en el suelo con la cara hacia el pecho para proteger el cuello y con los brazos alrededor de la cabeza. Los brazos no te matarn salvo mucha prdida de sangre y no son "vitales" como lo es tu cabeza o tu yugular. Pero si puedes, interpn cualquier objeto resistente en la boca del animal.    Con peleas de perros a veces es eficaz lanzarles agua para separarlos. Nunca hay que meterse por medio porque lo mismo a los dos les podra dar por pelearse contra ti y eso es mucho peor. A veces se puede dejar inconsciente a un perro de un golpe bien dado sin matarlo (no es justo matarlo si se puede evitar, ellos no suelen tener la culpa de estas cosas).       Depende mucho de la situacin que se d y de las cosas que tengas a tu alcance para defenderte. En el mejor de los casos, con palabras pausadas, firmes y seguras se puede frenar lo que sera un ataque. Nunca hay que hacer movimientos bruscos previos para no excitarlos. Ni tampoco darles la espalda.|`|011025cc23dbdb0248758e7c4ae607f1aa	hola, antes que nada te cuento que los perros siempre atacan poralgo, nunca porque s.  A veces la gente por desconocimiento hace cosas que para el perro son smbolo de agresin, algo muy comn que hace la mayora de la gente al ver un perro es acariciarle la cabeza, y eso para el perro es smbolo que lo quieren dominar y puede llegar a morder, jams se debe tocar un perro en su cabeza o en su cara, siempre se debe acariciar los flancos, otra cosa muy comn es correr cuando ven un perro en actitud amenazante, no se debe jams correr porque el perro tiene instinto de presa y saldr disparado detrs de la persona para cazarla, se debe bajar la vista y caminar despacio hacia otro lado. Otro error muy comn es gesticular mucho con los brazos, para el perro eso es una amenaza y puede atacar, tampoco se deben esconder las manos detrs del cuerpo, porque el perro puede suponer un ataque y hacerlo l primero, hay miles de cosas que la gente hace sin saber y que el animal puede interpretar como una amenaza, por eso siempre frente a un perro extra?o se debe proceder con cautela.  La regla de oro es JAMAS correr, tratar de tomar una actitud sumisa frente al perro y esperar tranquilo que se vaya, no hacer ningn movimiento brusco ni aparatoso.  Recordar que siempre el perro tender a atacar el cuello, cubrirlo con los brazos puede ser peligroso porque morder all, lo mejor es cubrirse con algo (una cartera si la llevan o cosa similar) si el perro muerde una pierna o un brazo jams tironear porque se desgarra el miembro y se puede amputar hay que dejarse llevar por el movimiento del perro para que se produzca el menor da?o posible, nunca tirar. Lo ms efectivo suele ser un pu?etazo fuerte en la parte de arriba del hocico, suelen soltar enseguida, las patadas y los pu?etazos en los flancos no sirven porque en ataque el perro es muy resistente al dolor.|`|EPSnvaQ8aa	O te mandas a correr o tratas de tomar su hocico con las dos manos... digo, eso es lo q he visto en peliculas!!|`|5sABho04aa	si un peroo t ataka lo q  debes hacer es kedart lo mas trakinla posible! si puede golpeale la nariz eso los trakiliza!!|`|A7QjzfBJaa	1,trata de subirte a algo alto donde el perro no te pueda alcanzar y pide ayuda [o] golpeale con un palo se hira corriendo.si es a otra persona pide ayuda y dale instrucciones a la persona y trata de  aullentar al perro.
D1beU6MPaa	What you do is, do the right thing. If your neighbor is complaining that your dog is barking too much, you find a way to make him not be a nuisance to other people. Bring him in the house and give him some attention. Many people have to work and a barking dog interrupting a person's sleep is being a nuisance, and annoying. Put yourself in that persons position and you can make a better judgment. You don't throw rocks, or threaten them. Act like a responsible adult and do the right thing.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I trained my dogs "no barking" when they were puppies.  My dogs are not allowed to bark, because barking would get on my nerves.  I go outside with my dogs when they go out, so they are never unsupervised.  However, where I live there is no disturbing the peace law, so I am stuck listening to my nasty neighbors dogs bark for 5 solid hours.  When I complained to my neighbors about their dogs barking, and jumping the fence, and attacking me, over and over, they did nothing, and the police did nothing, so I got a stun gun and solved everything.  |`|mfXDUkRYaa	You would have to do something about it. The dog is probably distressed or bored.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Its all in the approach. A bad confrontation usually begets a bad reaction.      Although, there are those folks who just enjoy being jack***es, and will pick a fight no matter how you handle it.     Sounds like theres a personal experience buried somwhere within those answer choices.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Well, this isn't really a simple question.    Does your dog really bark too much?  Note that for some people *any* barking is "too much"!  Is your dog really causing a problem, i.e., barking incessantly, just to hear himself make noise, or late at night?  If so, then definitely you need to address the situation.      Obviously you're not going to threaten the neighbor or do any of the illegal things you suggested! :-)  But if the neighbor is a well-known pain in the you-know-what, then maybe you can take their complaints with a small grain of salt.    That said, you *do* need to take responsibility for your dog's behavior, whether it's barking, running loose or other "nuisance" behaviors.  |`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Some meighbours complain even if a flock of birds fly overhead so you have to evaluate the complaint on its merit.Is the neighbour merely a trouble-maker and hates dogs and perhaps has it 'in' for you?If the answers to the above are NO then you have to realize that perhaps your animal or plural dogs may bark when you are at work and you are not aware of it or youi just do not hear your dog bark yet the neighbourhood does and you can easilly check the answer by asking other immediate neighbours whether they have any issues to prove your point.If you find the accusation is not valid and you can prove this then you a have a couple of alternatives that you have to consider and none are easy.l  had a very very nasty neighbour who lived over a quarter of a mile away (l was on a farm in the  country)and l was breeding dogs,he used to complain and complain my dogs barked all the time which was not true and caught him out when l went on vacation and all the dogs were boarded with some firiends and when l returned l popped into my neighbour's house and he did not know l had been away and said l hope the dogs have not barked much this last week and his reply was they kept him awake every night and barked non stop/Well l had great pleasure telling him that not only was he a liar but if he ever came onto my property l would call the local police to eject a trespasser and also sue him for defmation if he spread lies about m and my dogs.Had no trouble from him after that.He was a nasty piece of work and an ignorant so and so.Now getting back to your issue.You will have to carefully monitor whether your dog is actually barking or try my trick re above and have the dog away from your premises and confront the neighbour and with an independent witness and that means not a family member try my trick and see what happens.Alternatively if your dog is a barker and you know this is so it is your duty to your neighbourhood he does not bark etc during the so called curfew hours of 9pm- 8 am.Depends on the by laws of your county or town or district as noise pollution can be a reportable offence unfortunately.Forget question 2 and 3 as you do not wat to alienate your neighbour as they can turn even nastier to you your amily and animals andthis could lead to assult,deliberate damage to your property or the deliberate poisoning of your pets,In conclusion assess the situation logically,consider the alternatives and act in a reponsible law abiding manner no matter whether you would like to wring your neighbour's neck.OKAY l kust read your latest comment and you have to evaluate whether you just are super sensitive to dogs barking or whether you just hate dogs.Be honest and try and work out what the answer may be.If they are barking during normal day hours and not bothering anyne else bar YOU then l am afraid you will have no recourse under the law.If you can prove some neighbourhood dogs are barking at night and keeping you awake,YES you have avenues you can go through which are the local by laws of your district via your Council so check these and if you have a case then you can lay a formal complaint and also  report this issue to the ASPCA but be realistic and work out whether it is you or the dogs at fault here.Dogs as pets is a way of life in all cities,towns,countryside etc so you cannot stop people owning dogs unless they are being negligent with their animals or creating noise pollution and not merely your peculair pet hate,barking dogs|`|S6oy7ceJaa	1.. my dogs pretty friendly and easy going |`|OxFsslN8aa	4.  If they came nicely and respectfully I would (and have) try to control my dog's barking.  Not everyone likes dogs and tolerating a barking one is really hard.  My mini dachshund made my neighbors so made she screamed first at my dog and then at me for "ruining her life".  After she calmed down she explained that the sharp yapping hurt her ears and made being in her backyard difficult.  I could see her side of things and am working to make my dog less annoying.|`|iXijnCxOaa	1. I thank them for coming to me.  2. I assess whether it is my dogs causing the issue.  3. I address the problem.    Not very long ago one of my neighbors came to me to ask if things were all right- she had heard a large dog barking at 3 a.m. and was concerned.  All the dogs in the neighborhood are small except mine.  A day or so later we discovered we had new neighbors on the back side of the block and their Great Dane wasn't used to hearing the traffic yet.    My dogs are not allowed to bark outdoors.  Two barks and they are all hauled into the house and sent to their crates.  They learn FAST that barking is unproductive so they simply don't do it... which is why my neighbor was concerned rather than accusatory.|`|JCozkN7faa	one that would never happen because my dogs don't stay outside all day or all night, They are by my side all day except when im gone they are in crates!|`|qs6RMGvdaa	I keep my dogs in after a cetain time period. I don't let them out at night and if they are barking too much i keep them inside. It's not the neighbor's dog and it's not their responsibility to tell some one how to keep their dogs in. I don't mind my dogs barking, but I don't want it to be constant. |`|VYjERUo9aa	well of course if you know your dog is not one to bark (maybe occasionally) then I would assume they do not like dogs and I would go with 1-3, but if my dog did bark a lot I would feel obligated to do something about it and again for 5, if your dog doesn't bark, I would go with that also.|`|L16wLAhNaa	4.  Barking dogs can be just like screaming kids, sometimes you just can't get them to shut up.  You may be getting the bad responses from your neighbors that have loud dogs because you complain too much.  I'm not saying that you really do, just keep that in mind, some dogs can be hard to control.  Your neighbors shouldn't get mad at you for complaining about the noise.  That's just plain stupid on their part.  Although I probably would have just called the cops if it was really late at night.  Neighbors can be a little crazy sometimes.|`|hjhHsHMNaa	What would you do if somebody hated the sound of of your voice? You speak and dogs bark there really is no way to change that. I'm sorry that the sound of a dogs bark annoys you. I guess my best advice to you is to go somewhere where dogs are prohibited ie. an apartment. Don't know what else to tell you.|`|3qGbnbeyaa	try to controle your dogs barking if it makes the person agervated|`|9ryafb2Daa	Ok first of all.....  You need to do something about it.  Don't ignore it.  Good neighbors don't ignore things.  If your Neighbor told you to make your dog stop barking in a polite and nice way then you do it, but if he was demanding it and mean about it send him to hell.  Thats what I would of done. |`|9bgsyndIaa	Answer  4)  Take note if your dog is barking excessively.  There is nothing more annoying than to hear a dog barking constantly.  I am a dog owner, we have taught our dog not to bark.  Unlike the neighbor's dog who barks all day and all night long.  We have not said anything to the neighbor for fear of retaliation, and just put up with it.  Please if your dog is barking, be a considerate neighbor and TEACH your dog only to bark if necessary.|`|VPmdMB0raa	do none of the above! try getting one of those anti bark spray collar.

But if my neighbour started to become aggressive with this complaint, I would deffinitely lash back. Maybe with something like "I'll control my dogs if you control your kids parties, which the kids sometimes provoke my dogs.....Hm......"  Hah, but I guess that only works with me, because my neighbour has a 15 year old who always had people over late at night, while my dogs are let outside to go to the bathroom.  But then again, my neighbour is a very nice lady, so she would most likely tell me in a nice way, or not say anything at all.    =)|`|BLobaxhZaa	Personally, I would see how often the neighbor complains to me about things. If my dog was barking a lot I would definitly try to control it, but if the dog doesn't really bark all that much and the neighbor is a know complainer in the neighborhood, I would tell them that I would make sure my dog will keep it down, just to shut them up and get them away from my front door :)|`|QCgvxwCzaa	First of all, I am a dog owner. I am also a neighbor to someone with dogs that bark all the time and we cannot enjoy our yard or entertain because of the noise! We got a barking controller device that sends out a sonic signal to the dogs when they bark, thus discouraging their barking, and now we have peace and quiet in our yard now!    Secondly, dogs bark for a reason. They are bored; they want to be with their pack (us humans!); or they want attention. When pet parents come into our store, I always talk to them about why their dog might be barking, most of the time, training and understanding dog behavior helps solve the barking problem!|`|WLNX00c3aa	thank you for posting this up.  we have a neighbor who's dog is left outside barking at ALL HOURS of the day until 2 even 3 am.    first i would talk to the neighbor about the barking issue...then if it does not stop collect some information and then after that, report them to animal control or police for annoyance.      so far i've jst dropped off some business cards and fliers about dog training classes.  my next step is to talk to the neighbor.  i believe they put the dog outside when his wife/mom is not home.  |`|c6407b5d6f4fea13316e9ab4178c5586aa	Somehow I knew you were the complaining party, but I can completely understand your point. My cocker spaniel drives me nuts at  times, she's 11, hard of hearing, and a bit senile. The rabbits that come in our back yard drive her batty and she wants to bark her head off when she can tell they're there.  So I drag her back in the house cause I don't want her to bother anyone.   The point is if you as a neighbor approach in a calm demeanor, I'll be more receptive. If you're rude and obnoxious, well I'll still accept your complaint and do something about it. |`|EfovpbYGaa	Number 4.  I hate when my neighbor's dog barks.      jrbw|`|lXTlZFHPaa	You need to do something about it. They have grounds to call the police and have an ASBO served against you.    You need to control your dogs before they get you into trouble and if you harrass the neighbour complaining you could end up with a crimial record. You need to protect yourself and stop the noise|`|BpZe1oAWaa	here is my advice they can call the police for noise pollution and your dog can be taken away so approach this with cation (sweet talk them) say something like "I am so sorry for the inconvenience I will try to work with my dog to be quieter Once again I am so sorry" then they don't feel affended because if you Yell at them that will just make them angry and they may call the cops  
nc4SbvfRaa	We feed Science Diet at the portions are on the bag. I usually adjust slightly on the total to fit with my dogs activity and weight. We also split the amount in half and feed half in the morning and the other half in the evening. If you feed a quality food like Science Diet and feed once per day then you dog will have one stool movement per day. Twice/day feedings result in 2 stools/day.

As to how often, that can also be determined by the dog.  I have a 53lb pit bull cross who needs to be feed twice a day.  If I give her all her food at once, she will throw it up.  I feed high quality dry dog food in the mornings (about a cup and a half) and she gets a raw food diet in the evenings.  I give her cut up carrots, apples, bananas etc.  I cook the vegetables/fruit slightly since dogs can't easily digest plant fibres.  Then on top of that she gets a premixed raw meat food blend, either chicken or beef.  This blend contains ground bone matter, other fruits and veggies, and some vitamin supplements.  She had allergic reactions to most dry dog foods but with this combo, she's doing very well.  Her coat is shiny, she has lots of energy, and LOVES her food.  If your dog does fine on dry alone, then go with it. My last girl lived quiet healthily on dry.|`|cjtqklPlaa	Who is to say what is proper?

JGq9rKBOaa	Because rabbits are diggers and chewers! Some more than others, but it's a very natural behavior for them.    Is she spayed? Spaying can cut down on a lot of the "destructive" behaviors, but it won't eliminate them completely.     I use hay and newspaper in my rabbit's litter box, and he usually tears of the newspaper.     If you're not already, put lots of hay in the litter box. While this sounds like a disgusting habit to humans, sitting in the litter box and eating is a very natural combination for a rabbit. Just make sure to add clean hay often!       http://www.rabbit.org/ has FAQs on litter training, behavior, and just about everything - great resource for any rabbit owner.|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	I am not sure why rabbits di this but cats do this (especially females).

Although not a terminal condition if your dog does have this illness he/she really needs to go back to the vet to get treatment.

Enquire before treatment if that is something you may want to consider.    You coud also consider an interest free credit card or a loan to pay for the veterinary treatment.    In the UK the PDSA will pay the entire cost of the more basic procedures for those who are eligible {people are urged to contribute to the cost}.

I post my questions here on yahoo answers and find some really great, helpful and polite answers. sometimes i search on the internet and read some books.    but if your dog is really sick and needs medical treatment, find a way to confine it. my dog only have an anti-rabbies vaccine that's all she needed anyway not those papaly poopoos|`|bfSMlkivaa	Not get a pet. Duh.    Not taking your pet to the vet when it is sick is neglect.     If you have an animal now and you can't afford its vaccinations, check-ups, etc...then save the animal the future suffering and surrender it to your local shelter, where someone who can afford it can give it a home.|`|veDvtYhJaa	If your dog needs vet care, it needs vet care.  Not taking the dog to the vet is a violation of the laws against animal abuse.  It's as abusive to not take your dog to the vet as it is to not take you child to the doctor when needed.      If you cannot afford the vet bills, there are groups online you can ask for financial assistance for vet bills.  You can ask your local rescue groups for assistance.  Depending on circumstances, you can occasionally get financial help.  Most often, if you cannot afford to care for the animal by giving it proper vet care, then you should sign the dog over so they can find it a home with a family who can afford to care for it.      You can also ask the vet for a reduced cost if you temporarily can't afford the bill.  All these possible options depend on giving full details of your situation.  I can't tell you more because you told us so little. -!-|`|Mkl0bBmbaa	If you save just like 5 dollars a week or all your change into a jar you could start a savings account for just this reason .

Pet shop dogs are puppy mill dogs. For every one you see on display, they have 2 more in the back room in a tiny little cage they can barely move in, so they keep that "cute puppy waddle" from weak musculature.  They are traumatized by the experience of being taken from mom way too early and treated with no gentleness or compassion until sold.  FYI, many pet shops falsely state that pups are older than they are to give the impression of smaller size. Your 10 week old puppy could actually be only 5 weeks old.   Take him in right away. He may have serious medical issues that need to be adressed NOW, not next week.

Be near the door to get the dog outside quick if it starts  throwing up all the junk you gave it.  Good luck, and be patient.
ZT0K3q2Aaa	They could be hotspots. My dog Sadie gets them, It looks like a dry, flaky patch of skin|`|jQglJiMhaa	How old is your dog?    Most dogs have a microscopic mite population hitching a ride on their body, but the dog's immune system handles it all very nicely.  When the immune system is no longer able to control the mites, they begin multiplying, then attacking.  Because the immune system does not mature until 12-18 months of age, a dog with demodectic mange may have relapses until that age  Immune suppressed dogs require a high quality, all natural food. Select a raw food diet, a cooked diet, or an ultra premium dry food with lots of raw pulverized vegetables. Select organically grown vegetables or use one of the pesticide cleaners available in supermarkets for use on fruits and vegetables.  Add leafy dark green vegetables, cruciferous vegetables  broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, watercress, bok choy, and carrots (carrots should be blanched one minute to release the carotenes).  If you feed raw foods, increase the veggies.     To each meal: sprinkle a teaspoon of sesame seed oil--on the food.  This is an important oil for immune function and skin repair.  Also add a variety of dried sea vegetables like wakami, nori, dulce and kelp. The sea vegetables should be offered at least 4-5 days a week or even every day if your Akita likes it. Feed fish, boneless poached or canned fish.  Do not use tuna, tuna and swordfish are laden with mercury; sardines, salmon, mackerel or fresh water fish are good choices.  When giving fish, cook some white rice and mix with the fish.  Avoid grains like wheat or rye--rice, barley and oats are okay.       Topical treatment  1     Mix a combination of one part lavender oil, one part Neem oil,  to 9 parts almond oil. Apply to   sores and infected areas once or twice daily.     Topical treatment  2     Mix ten drops of yellow dock extract with ten drops of Echinacea extract, dilute with four ounces of distilled water and apply.  Yellow dock is effective as an itch treatment.  Other herbs that help with itching are calendula and aloe vera.     Topical Treatment  3     Make up a mixture of three tablespoons fresh lemon juice mixed with two ounces of witch hazel and four ounces of distilled water:  Add 10 drops of grapefruit seed extract and six drops each of tea tree oil, golden seal root, olive leaf extract, and pau d'arco. Keep away from the eyes.  Spray or dab onto sores once a day.      After each application each case, allow the topical solutions to dry.     Always consult your vet before proceeding with any natural remedies|`|kqa9VFrfaa	There are two kinds of mange -- wet and dry. Both can be treated without harsh chemicals, so do not let your vet give your dog anything that is going to make it sick. Try a different vet maybe?  Hot spots are different than mange, although they can be triggered by untreated mange. They need treatment ASAP to keep from getting bigger, deeper and infected.  Until U can get to the vet, U can use olive oil as an emergency help. This soothes the skin. Then keep the dog from chewing on that spot. That is the tricky part. Use cloth T-shirt or an Elizabethan collar. U can buy these at a pet store, or make a home made one out of an empty milk container, depending of course on the size of the dog.|`|GSf09ALBaa	There has to be holistic alternatives for this.

It is considered hereditary in that the demodex mites are naturally occurring on dogs, just as we naturally have mites in our eyebrows.  Most dogs have strong enough immune systems to keep them in check, but if a dog's immune system is weakened by stress or hereditary weakness,  the mites can bloom out of control and make bare itchy spots like this.|`|AA12322387	Really need more info..such as the age of the dog.

Ka3fbxszaa	Are you new to fish keeping? If not, maybe I misunderstand what you are saying here. What it sounds like to me is fish "poop!"  Nothing to be concerned about.    I would like to add that I agree with the above poster that a breeder tank can stress a fish out. If it is too soon for her to have the babies, she will stress and possibly have the babies early.|`|hIyjdXr9aa	Take her out of the breeder box and put her in the main part of the tank.  She's stressed, and that's not good for her or the babies.  Also, breeder boxes are pointless stupid things that stress fish unnecessarily.      Here's what you do:  1.  Take her out of the breeder box and put her in the main tank.    2.  Buy lots of plants (real or fake.  Real are nice because they add oxygen to your tank and mollies like to nibble on veggies.  Fake are nice because you can pack them tighter without having to worry about them not getting enough light.  Tightly packed plants protect the fry (baby fish) better because the parents can't fit in among the plants and the babies have a place to hide and not get eaten.)  3.  Add four tablespoons of aquarium salt for every ten gallons in the tank.  Mollies can live in anything from fresh to brackish to salt water comfortably, and a lot of the freshwater parasites can't survive in brackish water.  By adding salt to your water, you're killing all the bad parasites and things and not bothering your fish at all.  If you have other species in the aquarium, look up how much salt they like.    4.  Remove larger fish, especially predatory species.  The point is to remove any fish that will hunt down and eat your fry.  In general, fish that are smaller than mollies can stay, whereas something like a gourami would have to be removed.  I once had a gourami hunt down and eat a batch of swordfish fry.  It was horrible.  Remove the big fish before the babies get born.  The other mollies can stay, they won't eat too many babies if they eat any at all.    5.  I really hope you cycled that aquarium before you bought your fish.  If you didn't, go out and buy ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate test strips and make sure your water doesn't get too unbearable for the poor fish.  "New tank syndrome" is often fatal.  Here's an article on fishless cycling to make new aquariums ready for fish:  http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_fish...  6.  Feed your molly a mixture of foods.  Mollies have to have veggies mixed in with their diets or they get malnourished.  Feeding mollies an algae wafer every other day or so works well, and they also like fresh vegetables and munching on live aquatic plants.    If you do the above things, and if she really is pregnant (that's safe to assume, if she was in a mixed gender aquarium at the pet store), then she'll have the babies anywhere from right now to within a month.  Once she has the babies, you won't see them for anywhere from one week to a month.  They'll hide in the aquarium in the plants and eat whatever bits of things float by them.  If you have a healthy established tank, that'll mean small protozoans, bits of leftover fishfood, decaying parts of live plants, et cetera.  After a week to a month, you'll see the most daring of the fry dart out and begin to swim in open water with their parents.  Once they're large enough to not worry about being eaten, they'll join their parents in the main part of the aquarium.  :)

179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	I figured you meant 7 weeks gestation.    And yes, you should worm the dog while they're pregnant-- but you should do this under vet supervision.    As far as the vomitting, could be a number of things.  Usually 1 time of vomitting is not a thing to worry about, but if it continues for more than 12 hours, I would consult a vet.    As with vomitting or diarrhea, please be sure she's drinking and eating still-- dehydration can be a terrible thing for dogs, especially a pregnant one-- who needs to drink lots of water to keep her blood levels up in order to sustain herself during pregnancy.|`|AA10500537	presuming its 7 monthe old   it  maybe just ate something that upset its stomach if it keeps on you should have it looked at|`|IFiwmb3Haa	7 Weeks?

I'd consult a vet about worming during pregnancy, he'll know exactly what she can have that won't affect her puppies.|`|q5wKgjacaa	dogs have very delicate stomachs. Maybe she ate something that upset her stomach, don't worry much. I would not give her any chemical dewormer while pregnant, because they are a toxic and could harm her doggies.    Also, I do not know if she will have the babies at your house. If she does, kindly let her choose the place to deliver. Usually they will choose a shadowed, hidden very small place, usually with a corner or a sharp angle, to be able to push with their  legs to ease the delivery.  Do not bother her. Nature knows best. And please please please, do not touch the doggies when they are born. She will bring them to you when SHE is ready. Dogs may reject their babies when they smell like humans.
AA12322387	Take your cat to the vet.  Cats typically try to hide it when something is wrong..your kitty seems to be screaming for help.  The first thing that came to my mind was something about pottying...some difficulty..have you noticed straining or meowing in the litterbox?

We thought he was just being angry but then he stopped eating too which is weird because he usually loves to eat. I don't recall him limping but we ended up taking him to the vet because we found him lifeless laying in his litter box. He had a urinary blockage which is common in male cats because wherever the urine comes from, is a very small area unlike female cats which is why it gets blocked so easily. I would take your cat to the vet pronto. The same thing happened to my mother in law's cat just a few weeks ago and he ended up dying because she didn't bring him in early enough. :(|`|7feafcca345dc1ba46e01adef7b6e44faa	This could be a stroke.

After the divorce they had always met in an outside place to discuss their daughter.  Soooo  years later she had him over for dinner to discuss a problem concerning their daughter.This was the first time the birds had seen him in eight years. She said the second he entered the room the birds all yelled Hello Bird Brain. your birds will remember you if you had a good relationship.

NBfBKI1Uaa	No. Guppies can tolerate wide range of water parameters. If you water is soft, it simply mean their is less dissolved mineral in the water than water that is hard.

You amy think you and your family are doing a "fun" thing - but you are indirectly causing the death of other animals.  There are only so many homes - and not enough.  Trust me, I was a euthanasia technician for five years - it is almost unbearable.  Please look through the reference before you do this, and get your dog fixed.    "....Every day in the United States thousands upon thousands of puppies and kittens are born because of the uncontrolled breeding of pets. Add to that number the offspring of stray and abandoned companion animals, and the total becomes even more staggering. Every year, between six and eight million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters; some three to four million of these animals are euthanized because there are not enough homes for them. "     "Every cat or dog who dies as a result of pet overpopulationwhether humanely in a shelter or by injury, disease, or neglectis an animal who, more often than not, would have made a wonderful companion, if given the chance. Tremendous as the problem of pet overpopulation is, it can be solved if each of us takes just one small step, starting with not allowing our animals to breed. "|`|306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	If you are offering your dog at stud, then I assume he is finished.  Enter him as a special and win some BOBs and group placements.    If he does not have his championship, then why would people want to use him when there are so many high quality finished males available?    Do you know that once he is used you will have an increase in male behaviors like marking territory?  If he is really your house pet, you will continue to have a much nicer pet if he is NEVER used.  Having stud dogs can be a real pain in the butt, some can become quite hard to handle.    The ***** owners usually go looking for the stud, the stud owners do not go looking for the bitches.  If he is such high quality, they will be lining up for him.    And why would the ***** owner part with pick puppy?  They are doing all the work and, at best, you would get second pick.    I hope, being you also asked about a beagle, you are not thinking of breeding 'puggles'?  This country does NOT NEED MORE MUTTS!  Please do not breed them on purpose!    If you want a puppy, go buy one from a good breeder who knows what they are doing.  If you are set on breeding, do it the right way and go out and find a good show prospect, and start showing him.                dvm2b - Don't quote HSUSs halftruths and outright lies.

1ff9e67df354321888e8b4c0bd42e43eaa	How old was your puppy when you got her?  Generally parvo has approximately a 10 day incubation period.  Meaning she was likely exposed when you got her.  Advise where ever you got her that they have a potentially serious problem.    Parvo cannot be cured (mentioned by a previous poster),  It is a virus and all viruses have to run their course.  All your veterinarian can do is provide support therapy..... I.V. fluids, metoclopramide (for vomiting) and antibiotics.  In the clinic I work at approximately 70% of the dogs survive, depending on the breed - certain breeds - rottweilers and a few others, do not have as good a chance of surviving.      It is really hard to predict which ones will live or die.  I have left the clinic for the day "knowing" that a certain pavo puppy would be dead overnight, only to find the little thing yapping so much we couldn't wait to call the owner to pick it up!  Or others, I was sure would make it... didn't.      As for bleaching your entire house, as your vet about getting some Rocal or Nolvasan disinfectant or look at the store for disinfectants that are safe for hardwoods.  Parvo is pretty much in the ground everywhere and it can live for years.  People can easily and unknowingly track it into your house on their shoes.  It is nearly impossible to create a parvo free area unless you build an outdoor kennel with a concrete floor and keep it bleached.    You might consider looking for a different vet.  Where I work, the entire treatment for parvo is usually around $200-$300, not per day.|`|AA11390453	You'll never get rid of the smell.|`|AA10072754	If the vet sent your dog home...take it to another vet.

AA10172626	Unspayed female dogs go into heat which is messy and annoying, but more worrisome than that: unspayed female dogs sometimes develop a severe uterine infection (called pyometra) which requires surgery and can be fatal if not treated.  This infection usually occurs in older dogs when it is riskier (and much more expensive) to perform the surgery.     Unneutered males tend to be territorial, or are sometimes more likely to wander away from home in search of "love", or may develop undesirable habits such as urine marking.  But worse than that: they can develop prostate problems, or even testicular or prostate cancer, and again it usually occurs when the dog is older and surgery is riskier.    It is wise to have your pets spayed or neutered for their own health and to help with population control.|`|306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	You don't as long as you are responsible.

It cuts down on unwanted puppies and is healthy for your dog.  Spaying a female prevents unwanted males wandering around your home.  Also it keeps her from getting certain cancers in the uterus or because of horomones.  Also she wont go into heat.  Most females can become very aggressive when they go into heat.

Not only will you not have to worry about them going into heat, if it's a female and, and getting blood everwhere and having stray dogs coming after your dog, or running off to go find a female in heat if it's a male. Plus it always wanting to mark territory and being hiperactive most of the time. You also cut down on health risks that can develope later in life.  It is very easy for unfixed dogs to develope cancers and tumors. Not to mention the overbreeding of dogs is leading to too many dogs having to live in shelter and being put to sleep because no one will give them a home. So unless you plan to breed, get it fixed.|`|5f65b9e74453acc8ab24589c94264513aa	It helps control the animal population.

83ce223ef25fc85a256b8875adc528e4aa	You might be a good vet.  Remember though - vets also have to do some things that aren't pleasant, such as euthanizing (putting down) animals who don't respond to medical treatment, etc.|`|0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	Hi Sadie. It sounds like you're on the right track.    You need to have a lot more than a love for animals. You need to be smart (it takes an awful lot to get into vet school, and even more to get through!), you need to have a love for medicine and you need excellent people skills.     You also need to be pretty tough...getting into vet school is hard, but in the greater scheme of things, that's the easy part! The hours, even while you're still at vet school, are terrible. You get the 'joys' of dealing with stupid people on a daily basis (the flipside of that is that you also meet some absolutely wonderful people), you need to be able to deal with animal suffering, and things like euthanasia are part and parcel of daily practice.     That said, I'm training as a vet and I love it. I'd never want to do anything else. If it's the right job for you, then it's a brilliant thing to do.    Like others have said, when you're a little older, start approaching animal shelters to do some volunteer work. When you get to high school, find out if they've got an organised work experience program, and use that to spend some time in a vet clinic. A little determination goes a long way, so if you keep on  working at it, you'll do well. If you don't make it to vet school, there are always other careers, like veterinary nursing.|`|AA11481777	eat fish, theres nothinh wrong whit that|`|AA12111579	call AREA 51|`|AA10840732	go for it!! there  aren't enough vets out there...I'm a medical adviser for guinea pigs at a local humane society shelter...there vet loves it because it saves them a lot of money and he has never questioned my diagnoses and treatments.|`|AA11061445	my mom is training to be a vet and says its a lot of hard work she has 4 months left on her course she is a vet nurse in the uk and i think you would make a good vet|`|AA12368754	When you get old enough to work volunteer at an animals hospital as a kennel worker or assistant.  You gain much needed experience for school and get a better idea of whether this is what you want to do or not.  As you get older you can get more experience.  The most important thing is that you have excellent grades.  Vet schools are very hard to get into.  Make sure that you are strong in science and math classes and take extra classes of these in high school.  Once in undergrad major in a science based course.  If you are in a state that has a veterinary school your chances of getting in are better, as in state students are given preference.  It is more difficult to get into a school that is not in your state until you have all A's.  Work hard in school and gain alot of experience and you might well be on your way.  You will think all of your life you can't wait to get to vet school and then when you are there you will think it is the hardest thing you have ever done and wish you weren't here.  But I have heard that it is very rewarding once you are done (I guess I'll see when I graduate in a year).|`|b91e53472369697a16ad83b3bab7627faa	You seem like a smart and caring kid.  I think you would make a good Vet!  Just keep in mind that in order to be a vet, you may have to put a very sick or injured animal to sleep (give it a shot to kill it.)  I wanted to be a vet until I found out about that!  I've started a small kitten rescue group for ophaned kittens (under 6 weeks) that wouldn't live otherwise and I love it.  Also consider a zoo keeper or animal trainer.  I believe you can be whatever you want to be and I'm sure you'll be great at it.  Just try to remember  your dreams when you become a teen and would rather be out with friends than studying.  Best of luck to you.

Very comfy boxers.|`|4b96522cdada9bee2a93669cc4023651aa	Here is the best placeto learn about the breed:    http://americanboxerclub.org/     That takes you to the National Breed Club  that is the only club about the breed that is recognized and accredited by the AKC and it  sets the standards for the breed .     They also have links to other sites about Boxers.    The Clubs' websites will give you an ENORMOUS amount of information about the breed - the good, the bad, and the why or why not to get that breed.  Look for the links "Health" and "Information" at the top of the webpage - they have huge number of sub-links.  Please pay close attention to the "Health" sub-links.  Boxers are prone to inheriting many very serious illnesses that are not often seen in other breeds - in addition to the common hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia.    The clubs websites also have:    (1) a breeders list - all of whom have agreed to abide by the breeders code of ethics (which you can read)    (2) a link to the breed rescue for their breed    Do give serious thought to adopting from an adult from a breed rescue. The clubs' breed rescues go to a great deal of trouble to determine the dog's temperament, personality, likes and dislikes (particularly kids and cats and other dogs in the household), health, and level of training. They make a huge effort to match the right dog to the right home - and if they don't have one they think will be suitable for your home, they won't place it. Great way to avoid the puppy training, newspapers, chewing.......They have dogs that are purebred and sometimes part-bred (1/2 or so of their breed.) Dogs that come through rescue are so thrilled to have a forever loving home having once been abandoned to a shelter or rescue that they are typically extra devoted and loving. Dogs lose their homes for reason that are not their fault: death, divorce, a move and they couldnt keep them, financial problems.    If you decide to get a puppy, please use one of the breeders who are members of the breed club. A well-bred pet puppy may not be a candidate for the show ring (that nose being 1/8th of an inch to long or something else very picky) but they will be very healthy, the parents carefully screened for hereditary health problems (and this involves a LOT more than a physical by the vet) , and from a breeder who has devoted a great deal of time to understanding the breed and bloodlines. A responsible breeder will have a written contract with a health guarantee for hereditary problems; require that if for any reason you ever have to give up the dog that it comes back to them; and always be available for help, assistance and advice about your dog. Such a breeder will tell you if they don't think their breed is right for you based upon your needs. They want a perfect forever home for the puppies - not the money. (In 43 years in the dog show world, I have never known a breeder of that caliber who has made a profit on their dogs - it is labor of love.)    A puppy from such a breeder costs no more - and often less as poorly bred dogs tend to have very high vet bills over the years - than from a backyard breeder who doesn't do the health checks, knows nothing about the breed or bloodlines, doesn't give a guarantee, never wants to hear about the puppy again and has breed from mediocre or poor quality dogs.    You may find the breeder who has the type of dog you want but no litter on the ground at the moment. Most good breeders have waiting lists -get on it. You may find the breeder and puppy you want but at a distance. Among the really responsible breeders(members of the club) shipping a puppy is quite normal -they want the best possible home for the dog and the written contract is very extensive.     Do ask the breeders on the club list if they have any dogs they bred that they need to rehome - good breeders all require if the owner can't keep one, it comes back to them. It may be a dog they placed and it came back because the owner didn't have time, didn't realize how big it would get, got divorced.... It may be a dog who was a show prospect but as they grew didn't meet their early promise. It may be an AKC Champion they decided not to use in their breeding program because while it did get the Championship, they don't need more bloodstock or find a tiny conformation flaw they don't want to reproduce.      NEVER EVER buy from a pet shop. Those puppies came from puppy mills where the parents are locked in cages, bred until they literally die from it, never vaccinated, never wormed, fed just enough so they don't quite die of starvation, live in filth, never bathed or groomed or cared for, are typically of very poor genetic stock both physically and often mentally. The puppies are shoved off to pet stores with no vaccinations, no worming, no socialization or handling... You are buying nothing but heartbreak at a price higher than what a responsible breeder charged for a pet puppy    .IF A SERIOUS BREEDER OR RESCUE TELLS YOU THAT THE BREED IS NOT SUITED FOR YOUR SITUATION - BELIEVE THEM - NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THE WAY THE DOG LOOKS|`|AA10304847	Look at Jane Furrows answers and questions here on Yahoo.Answers.Com, ....she's filled with boxing lore.

You might want to check out some of the wolf rescues and see if they have anything up for adoption.  Some wolf hybrids don't belong in a home with people they are just to hard to handle.    There is a wolf rescue here in New Mexico called Candy Kitchen Wolf Rescue.  I have worked with them on a few occasions to place their hybrids, but they are very careful as to who is qualified to handle a wild animal.  They are very very very selective as to who they place their hybrids to.    They are close to Grants NM but futher south.  Out in the middle of nowhere.

Cjn153A3aa	Most dogs tend to be lactose intolerant. This means that they lack the enzyme beta lactamase, which allows the digestive system to break down the kind of sugar contained in milk.     Dogs that lack this enzyme end up with a lot of undigested sugar in their intestinal tract, which creates a wonderful breeding environment for bacteria. When a lot of bacteria grows in the intestinal tract it can irritate the stomach and intestine and cause vomiting and diarrhea. These are the same problems that occur in lactose-intolerant people.    That being said, while many dogs are lactose intolerant, some are not. Some dogs love the taste of milk and other dairy products and won't have any stomach or intestinal problems when they get some as a treat.     The bottom line is, it may be okay to give your dog a small amount of milk if it doesn't cause her any vomiting, diarrhea, or other discomfort. Check with your veterinarian first to be sure it won't cause your pooch any health problems or interfere with his diet.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Milk from their mom is healthy for puppies, other milk is not good for puppies, unless you lick to clean up diarrhea..

4cf35c900baf2aa599f838360f31396eaa	It sounds like the female needs to be licensed. Please go to the site listed below and read everything, I only copied portions of it here.    Backyard Breeder -- Dog Breeding License Required: Any person, except for someone having a valid kennel license who, for pay or other compensation, breeds a female dog must obtain an animal breeding permit. The permit fee is $125. In order to prevent the over-breeding of animals, each permit authorizes the whelping of no more than one litter per female dog in any 12-month period and no more than one litter per domestic household in any 12-month period. (Los Angeles County Code Title 10, Sec. 10.20.045 and 10.90.010).    HOWEVER, you really need to read this whole site, here is a clip.  IMPORTANT CHANGES   TO THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CODE   REGARDING DOGS  In an effort to improve public safety and reduce the number of stray dogs overwhelming our animal shelters, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed an ordinance that requires all residents of unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County to have their dogs spayed or neutered and have an identification microchip implanted in each dog. The measure applies to all dogs over the age of four months kept in unincorporated (non-city) areas of Los Angeles County.  - http://animalcontrol.co.la.ca.us/cms1_04...      more:  By spaying or neutering your dog, you are helping solve the problem of pet overpopulation and protecting your dog from potential harm. However, since some dogs cannot be spayed or neutered for certain reasons, this ordinance has exemptions for these cases. These are:    Dogs which are unable to be spayed or neutered without a high likelihood of suffering serious bodily harm or death due to age or infirmity. Written confirmation from a licensed veterinarian is required to qualify for this exception.   Dogs used by law enforcement agencies for law enforcement purposes.   Service or assistance dogs that assist disabled persons.   Competition dogs. A Competition Dog is a dog which is used to show, to compete or to breed, which is of a breed recognized by and registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC), United Kennel Club (UKC), American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA) or other approved breed registries. The dog or owner must also meet ONE of the following requirements:   The dog has competed in at least one dog show or sporting competition sanctioned by a national registry or approved by the department within the last 365 days; or   The dog has earned a conformation, obedience, agility, carting, herding, protection, rally, sporting, working or other title from a purebred dog registry referenced above or other registry or dog sport association approved by the department; or   The owner or custodian of the dog is a member of a department approved purebred dog breed clubs, which maintains and enforces a code of ethics for dog breeding that includes restrictions from breeding dogs with genetic defects and life threatening health problems that commonly threaten the breed.   If you believe your dog meets one of these exemptions, please complete and return an Exemption Application.     Effective Date of Enforcement  This ordinance became effective on June 1, 2006.  The current grace period has been extended until March 1, 2007 to allow dog owners adequate time to comply with the new requirements.  However, owners of stray dogs that are impounded at a County shelter during the grace period will be required to comply immediately.  After the grace period has ended, dog owners will be expected to be in compliance with this ordinance.    Fines and Penalties  A first violation of this ordinance is an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. If the owner fails to correct the underlying cause of the violation within 30 days after being notified of the violation, it shall be deemed a second violation. A second violation is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed six months or by a fine not to exceed $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each subsequent violation shall be considered an additional misdemeanor.    The full text of this ordinance is available on our website. If you still want more information, please visit your local County shelter, write to us at 5898 Cherry Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90805, or e-mail us, using the link on our website homepage. You may also contact us by telephone at (562) 256-7104.

I'm not sure about LA but there may be a site where you can print out the form and send in the papers plus money.  Thats it.  Here in Sacramento county its cheaper if your dog is neutered and micro chipped ($30 for neither....$10 for both done....and this is for one year).  And why do you have a breeder's permit if you aren't controlling your dog?  You probably can't get one for this pup because of that and your other one might be suspended.

I'm a master groomer, and here's my advice, (remember you asked!).  1) cats need their coat, and shaving changes the QUALITY of the hair.  It gets nasty feeling.  2) cats embarrass easily, and I can assure you your cat will hide for 3 days after you do the deed.  3) your cat only needs a professional bath with a "deshed" process getting all the under coat (as much as possible) out.      Trust me, most groomers will shave your cat just because you want it done.  I've been in the business for 30 years +, and I know what I'm talking about!  Also, here's this:  cats have very thin skin, and it slices easily.  You could cut your cat with clippers and not know it for some time.  It won't bleed quickly, and cats don't usually let you know they've cut them by yowling (as a dog would "yip").  You could by "in"  way over your head here.      This being said, I know it's your cat, do your thing.  If you JUST HAVE to do this, use a professional clipper, Oster or Andis (around $120) and NOT the "pet clipper" type sold at many retail stores.  Use a  10 blade, and hold on tight.  Cats don't like being touched with things that buzz, and it could be a wild ride.  Keep H2O2 on hand for any cat scratches or bites, and have fun.  Then when you're finished call a professional to smooth out the hack marks and pay another $50+ to have the job done.    Happy clipping, see ya in the hospital!

If you want, you can get him a companion, but the last thing you need to do is get him a "girlfriend".|`|UQKI3vZtaa	First get him a "date" with the vet (snip, snip)  Then you & him get a "date" with a dog trainer  THEN & only then when you have been responsible, can you get him a "playmate".  REPEAT ABOVE WITH "PLAYMATE"|`|2eEMo2Asaa	i heard chiweenies are cute puppies!   but the humping thing isn't b/c he is horny  if you want to breed him make sure you are either going to keep the puppies or find them good homes where you are willing to take the puppy back if they can't be good parents.  I guess i'm a back yard breeder b/c my chi is pregnant and ready to give birth any day...maybe hours.   But even so i have all good homes already for the puppies and even though they are pure breed i didn't register them.  But if i sell them i'm more than willing to show whoever wants to buy the mother and father...theses babies are going to be cute!  But it is a good idea to get him fixed b/c dogs will hook up w/ anything that will let em...sooooo just be careful and enjoy your chi! they are awesome|`|HqpDo9BYaa	There is no such thing as a 'teacup' dog breed.  What you have is a runty Chihuahua.  The best thing you can do for him is get him neutered, because 99% of the pups he sires will have genetic problems.  Neutering him will also prevent numerous cancers.|`|uri8tWavaa	A Lab, either chocolate or black.  :)|`|lmrjMKJbaa	Please get him neutered and then you can find him a PLAYMATE.

Be responsible.|`|AA10145121	A Bull Mastuff. That will stop his humping and if it dosen't, run for the hills.|`|7I7D3OQvaa	It's called obedience class!

He doesn't need a friend, just some guidance.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	I think you'd be better off with your dog being neutered.  If you think that a teacup chihuahua is a breed of dog then you don't know anything about dogs so you should not be breeding them.  And humping is not a sexual thing with dogs, it's a dominance thing.  That's another thing that you don't know about dogs.|`|AA10072754	a knife, emasculators, and something to stitch it all up when done.      Best done by the vet.  Ask for a neuter|`|WbRhr0OYaa	Well fist there is NO such thing as a "teacup" chihuahua. Secondly there are already an overabundance of chis that are dying in shelters. Thirdly IF you are willing to become a murderer and breed your dog then find one of the same breed. Dogs are not to be bred untill they are 2 years old, proven champions in the show ring and have been tested for genetic diseases. Dont become a BYB.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	You are ill informed, any dog humping is not a sign of what you think it is..I bet if you read a book on dogs you could know what that really means! And when you do I hope I am on to hear about it!  Education is always a good thing!|`|Bw18seFqaa	get him neutered.  There is no reason to find him a girlfriend and make mixed breed dogs just because he humps things.  Dogs hump to display dominancy.. its no inditaction that they need to mate.|`|o5shNYLIaa	Just get your dog neutered.    Many people enjoy the companionship of cats and dogs, who were domesticated thousands of years ago. Over time, people have manipulated animal breeding to produce certain physical characteristics, resulting in the different types of cats and dogs we know today. But domestication took these animals out of their natural environment, and their reproduction is no longer regulated by predators or habitat. The result is an overpopulation crisis that can only be controlled through widespread spaying and neutering.    One unspayed dog and her offspring can lead to 67,000 dogs in six years. One unspayed cat and her offspring can produce 420,000 cats in seven years. Approximately 70,000 puppies and kittens are born in the United States each day. Some of them are born to breeders who sell animals for a profit, some are born to people who want their cat or dog to have the experience of having a litter or who want their children to witness the miracle of life, and some result from allowing fertile animals to roam freely and mate.    Whatever the reason, the number of cats and dogs far exceeds the number of loving homes available. Unwanted animals are often treated as a nuisance; incidents of kitten drownings and dog abandonments are common. Many people drop animals off in rural areas, thinking that someone will take them in or that they can fend for themselves. But the tragic fates for these animals include cruel treatment, starvation, disease, freezing, highway death, procurement for research laboratories, and more unregulated breeding. Even if someone can find homes for one litter of kittens or puppies, the overpopulation cycle continues if the animals are allowed to breed. And animals from breeders occupy homes that could have taken in homeless animals, who are destined to be destroyed.    Animal control agencies and shelters receive approximately 6 to 8 million animals annually. Those who are not adopted within about a week or two (3 to 4 million of them) are killed either by painless lethal injection or by inhumane methods, such as the use of carbon monoxide or decompression chambers. In many areas where pound seizure is permitted, unclaimed animals can be given or sold to laboratories.    Spaying and neutering helps stem the tide of overpopulation. It does not affect animals energy levels or change their personalities, as some people mistakenly believe. Spaying eliminates the stress and discomfort that females endure during heat periods, eliminates the risk of uterine cancer, and greatly reduces the risk of mammary cancer. Neutering makes males far less likely to roam or fight, prevents testicular cancer, and reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Altered animals are less likely to contract deadly, contagious diseases spread through bodily fluids, such as feline AIDS and leukemia.|`|u2yrsOjkaa	None. I sincerely hope you are kidding, or a troll, or both. Humping is domination, and is not at all related to anything sexual whatsoever. You obviously do not know anything about dogs, or Chihuahuas for that matter, considering there is no such thing as a teacup.    Google "the truth about teacup dogs," and schedule a neuter for your dog if you really have one.
AQIF3qIbaa	The most popular and successful method is called Schutzhund training, which is the program that many police utilize internationally.  It is also a competition, just like agility or tracking, in which many rottweiler and german shepherd breeders will enter their dogs.    Here is a site that explains what it is:  http://www.workingdogs.com/doc0035.htm    And, here is a book!!    http://search.barnesandnoble.com/How-to-...    http://search.barnesandnoble.com/K9-Schu...    http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Schutzh...    The second book may be more instructive, but a friend of mine lent me the third book on this list, and it was VERY informative about how the training works, and how to choose a dog who would actually be compatible with the training.|`|qsR4R79yaa	I think that at first you should have someone else help you out with it, just to make sure you get it done right. I know there are people who train dogs for a living and it would be good to have some human help instead of just learning from a book.|`|VwDUJuVCaa	I don't have any to suggest because I think it's a bad idea.

Then he gets punished, not you.|`|AA11110651	This is something that should be taught to a dog under the guidance of a PROFESSIONAL. doing this yourself will leave you open to all sorts of liability. If you aren't willing to put in the time effort and money to find a proper trainer for your dogs do not attempt this.|`|AA10072754	Hun this requires a license (I know what you're talking about...its a sport) which means professional training.      Either way if your dog mistakes your command and attacks someone its bye bye for them.     Books can't teach it...only tell you about it.

AA10072754	some dogs just aren't barkers....    but if you want her to bark train her to bark.  Do something that makes her bark and reward her for it.|`|kv42U6yraa	First off, as a reply to the person who first answered: pit bulls are breeds! They just aren't recognized a purebred by the Westminster Kennel Club. They are purebred, though!    Second, some dogs are just more quiet then others (like some children or people don't talk as much as others). There isn't a true way to get them to bark. There is the trick of "rewarding when they bark", but for dogs who hardly bark in the first place it's kind of hard to fall threw. I just say be happy that you didn't get stuck with a dog who barks to much. Be extra thankful for that because if your pit bull barks to much you'd get in extra trouble if reported by a nosy and annoyed neighbor all because you got a pit! If she doesn't want to bark, then she doesn't want to bark. That's all I can say.|`|zrvrhOpFaa	an am.staff or pitt bull (pitt bulls are muts, they are a mix between an american staffordhire and an american bulldog I don't know where people come off saying they're a breed they arent.) anyway they need very special and CONTROLED training in order to overcome their natural fight instinct. take her to classes, not only for yourself and your children but for society|`|erudFqChaa	no you don't! you will regret it!|`|Viyd8Furaa	im not really for sure on how to make them bark. like one person said some dogs just arent barkers. all i can say is maybe try contacting a professional trainer and ask them. sorry couldnt be more of help    LOL Pit Bulls are mutts??? well somebody isnt very educated now are they? do some research before coming on here and sounding ignorant.
C3N6Zi0Raa	i agree and have been against rodeos forever and i have a friend susanna who had gotten a beautiful grey horse named tatters he was used for the bronco riding and she was retraining him to be ridden again. well one day she was riding him bare back because that is how much he was abused and she accidently brushed her leg over a sore spot and man did he throw her far. why let me see HE WAS ABUSED BECAUSE THE ANIMALS WERE NOT TREATED LIKE STARS.     you people have no idea what your talking about and i see that you want to keep it cause you want to keep being paid your money that you get when you  do this sickening sport. i see and know why you are saying that but your answers are bs      AND TO THE PERSON WHO SAID that dressage, show jumping and the other do YOU SEE THEM roping a cow of calf down and tying their three legs together NO I DONT THINK SO.       ENGLISH RIDING is proper and they do not abuse their animals like you guys so you guys have been misinformed of that and we dont use the reins for whipping them you guys do it and dont care we do and i do not treat my horse like that i have ridden english and western and i prefer english because you are not just riding you are also controlling your balance communicating through your butt and legs where areas i see that you guys dont you have to use something to stimulate them to go.      and if your going to say that this sport does not abuse them i want you to go to tatters and tell him that it was all his imagination and that he does not have sore spots and yes they DO HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN all over their body that is why you cant nudge them on their sides cause you well hit the ground before you know what is going on. and they do so dont give me this that they are a thousand pound animal and they are bigger it cant hurt them why dont i ride you around and see how you like it and i do exactly to you what the sport does to them and i know that when the day is over you are going to be sore cause that is what they go through.|`|XU0JhWpTaa	i agree, i commented on youtube|`|9ygAaPCnaa	I think SHARK is about the most biased source you can find.     |`|XDJjPBMyaa	where are these pictures from i agree with bb do you even know how rodeos started probally not because you asked this so i am going to tell you this... rodeos started when calfs and sterrs left the herd  in bull and bronc rding they are not doing anything that is nit naturally the only thing different from bronco riding and braking a horse is that in bronco rding there is not a full saddle.. barrel racing is pure skill it takes alot of hard work  next time you have a hambuger think a famer or cowboy for rounding up that cow|`|35dfebce47b8a80fc0d8e4ed1f2f73f8aa	I agree that some rodeo needs reform.

They are NOT fair to the animals, and they are disgusting and unnecessary. Yes, I see where they come from historically, in that cowboys were on the range with cows and horses that bucked, but rodeos have escalated into a "sport" that is mean and dangerous for the animals. I have definitely been to my fair share of rodeos and I think they are horrible.|`|A8mdmxi9aa	you believe what you see....rodeos are not cruel....plain and simple...you saw a video and for some reason you think you are educated....no sorry girly... your not..lol.    ..i was the one who posted the question earlier about you tube...that is why people think it is so horrible...cause they saw a video....please grow up      EDIT...or instead of using these animals for sport ..... we should slaughter them all...cause what else would we do w/ them... we gripe and gripe about them being mistreated but there would be just that many more animals going to slaughter if we didnt use them.....um....what to do....    kevin and john....i like you :) lol    EDIT AGAIN:  ..........in what state is it illegal to use a freaken hot shot....im lost on that.....

As a person who has supplied and knows people who supply roping steers and knowing several of the major bucking bull breeders(Ace of Spades, The Castillos, 4 C's), I've had the priveledge to experience and see how these animals live outside the rodeo circuit. Hmm. Getting to sit in a large pasture with all the forage, breeders cubes, and heifers you want sounds like a darn aweful life to me. Cause heaven forbid SHARK looks away from all the starving, crippled, and neglected animals in their own cities.  IT's the newest turnip truck trend to bash decent people who are out making a difference in the world such as PRCA having their "Tough Enough To Wear Pink" rodeos and donating money to The McDonald house and St. Judes hospital. But hell, a 2,000 lb bull can't handle his fragile little self.      EDIT: Let me guess that SHARK and you are also against the use of hot wire fences. Cause we shouldn't let our poor little fragile 1,000 lbs horsies that could so easily kill us if they felt the want- instead we should let them run FREE!!! FREE FREE!!!!    I wish SHARK would just stick their hand on a hot wire and leave it there. Maybe then they'll get a clue. I've been hit with many different kinds of hot shots, even the one they claim was being used at the Cheyenne Rodeo(hot shot power mite) and it's made for swine. It barely made my legs tingle when I got hit with it.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	I have been to a lot of rodeos and have never seen an animal abused like the crap I have seen done to animals brought in to an auction or even in peoples privet pastures and barns.

And then where would we be????????????|`|rTSwouqXaa	First before you go bashing rodeo, let me explain something.  1st  Most of the events in rodeo are also used on ranches to work cattle and horses.  Let us start with calf roping. Do you know why they do this? Probably not. Calf roping is used everyday on a ranch, and if caught properly(takes years of training) it does not harm the calf. Calf roping is for doctoring(administering medication to the animal), these calves on ranches are not the tame cute little things you see at the petting zoo. They are wild as a spring hair. It is a neccesity when working on a ranch to keep the calves healthy.  2nd   Team roping, they again do this on ranches to doctor steers and larger cattle, you can not just go up and lay down a 2000lbs cow if it is sick. And you would be amaized on how fast and strong even a sick cow is.    3rd  Bulldogging, This is used to catch a steer, when you have lost your rope. It does happen and sometimes its the last resort. By the way Bill Pickett(a black cowboy) is the first to do this.    4th   Barrel racing came from turning cattle back to the herd when on cattle drives. Its to show of the speed and adjility of the horse.  5th  Bullriding(not used on a ranch), First thing about bullriding is the flank strap goes just infront of the hips of the animal, there are no genitalia anywhere near the flank strap. And, if the flank strap is too tight it is impossible for the animal to buck(like if you took belt and cinched it as tight as you can around your waist, you can't move), and if the flank strap is too loose the bull will not buck. And every animals requires a different tention. The spurs used are specialty spurs not to harm the animal, a bulls skin is quite thick. The bulls are taught from an early age to buck, they are trained to do this like you would train a dog to fetch a ball, they enjoy it.  6th  Bareback bronc riding(not used on a ranch) this is to show the skill of the cowboy, to be able to ride a bucking horse with no saddle. The same rule applys on the flank strap and spurs and training.  7th  Saddle bronc(sometimes used on ranches) Hey, every horse can buck and sometime they buck hard on their own, and sometimes they do it with you in the saddle weither you want them to or not. Saddle bronc is just showing off the ability of the cowboy as a rider. The same rule apply's on the flank strap, spurs, and trianing.     8th  Bullfighting(commonly known as rodoe clowns) These men are to clowns, as life is to death. The American Bullfighter is the most respected man in rodeo. He is a life saver. A American Bullfighter sole reason for being is to save a bullrider even if it means his death. They also have a competion showing off dangerouse manuvers with a true fighting bull. Trained(again) to go after anything that is eye level.     The ''Shocking device'' shown in the video has no more juice than a 9v battery on the toung. It does not hurt them it is more like getting hit by stattick shock(I have been hit by many they don't hurt they only startle)    Bucking horses and Bucking bulls are becoming a breed. These animals are bred for their desire and willingness to buck. They are not beaten to do this, they spend years in training for this. And Yes the are ATHLETES. Very good athletes. As with all PRO SPORTS there are accedents. A bull or a horse will buck so hard they throw themself off ballance and they fall. Remember, the cowboy goes with the animal and manytimes comes out more injured than the cowboy.  These cowboy do this because they love the sport, yes they make money but that is last on their mind. Its the love, and the respect of winning the gold buckle.     One sided oppinions is how biggotry starts. Are you a Biggot?  I don't try to spred uneducated rumors about other sports because I don't know enough about them.       Edit- And why would anyone want to harm something that you just paid 1 MILLION DOLLARS for. Yes these bucking animals go for that much. Look it up.    Edit- One more thing Rodeo has been around much longer than our nation. Rodeo is spanish for ''gathering'', and has been around sense the late 1600's.  Again look it up.    Edit- 6000volts? What? You might wanna check that again. That is the voltage of an exucation chair! And I am pretty sure a C cel battery can not produce that much power. You might wanna 1 graduate Jr High 2 make a living on your own 3 stick a penny in wall socket and save us a bunch of trouble.|`|AA10072754	Rodeos aren't that bad...really.  Some of those animals get better health care than their riders do!!!    Anyways this is basically a simulation of what people would have done back in the day before established methods came about.  If your horse was bucking while you were on it, if a calf had left the herd and needed to be taken back, and much more.  This wasn't created to be cruel.    Also the video states that the use of electronics is illegal right?  Well thats not the fault of the sport that people are doing illegal things.  That would be like saying its the fault of the country that people are illegally importing cocaine.    So in general, no I don't think rodeos are cruel.  |`|cZGnqPhMaa	Honestley the only thing i like at rodeos is barrel racing i dont like the rest i think the rest is kinda mean to the animals just let the wild horses be they dont want anyone on them |`|0b5a56782995bbba12d4a4575376a75baa	Oh great!  Not again!!!      This question has been asked, debated & answered more times than necessary.  It is not worth the time & effort it would take to try to explain.  So, go back to youtube & let them tell you some more of what to think, because ANYONE who watches that crap & believes it is not smart enough to think for themselves & form an intelligent, educated opinion.    THAT is my view & not an arguement...      **EDIT**  previous questions!!!  PLURAL, many many times over.  Also, I cannot believe you are worried about the use of hotshots!!  Good Lord child we use to have fights with them when we were kids....ON PURPOSE!! & our skin is a whole lot thinner than a horse & especially thinner than the skin of cattle.  They make leather from bovine hides.  Do us ALL a favor, do NOT believe what you see on something as ridiculous as youtube.  I mean come one, that is not exactly a reliable source of information.      **EDIT**  I see MORE misinformation has come to you from the youtube.  6000 volts?  What imbocile told you that a hotshot has 6000 volts?  That moronic statement shows right there that you don't even know what a hotshot is & have never been shocked by one.  They barely leave 2 red dots on a human's bare skin & YES!!  horses & cattle do have thicker skin than humans, no matter what youtube tells you.  Ever given a horse or a cow a shot?  The needle is A LOT harder to get into the hide than it is to get into human skin.  OOPPSS!!  Sorry, I gave you a "true" fact there.  And doubt it all you want to child...We DID have fights with them when we were kids.    6000 volts!!!  THAT IS ABSURRED & RIDICULOUS!!!  See what we mean by GETTING THE "TRUE" FACTS BEFORE OPENING YOUR MOUTH!!!    Let me say this AGAIN, since soooo sooo many have obviously NOT thought about it BEFORE asking UNEDUCATED questions & making UNINFORMED comments....    "IT IS BETTER TO STAY QUIET & BE THOUGHT A FOOL, THAN TO SPEAK & REMOVE ALL DOUBT"      You did not want other people's views on this subject, you wanted people to agree with your uneducated & even ignorant view on a subject you know NOTHING about as is typical with ALL questions from children who think youtube is a source of "real" information & not just a collection of b.s.        *EDIT**  BB, John & Kevin  THUMBS UP TO Y'ALL        *EDIT*  What it is EXACTLY that SHARK is fighting against?  TRUE & ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM EDUCATED & INFORMED SOURCES???  NOT even close!!!!      *EDIT*  Here another bit of REAL information for your uneducated uninformed child's mind.  Horses & cattle have h-a-i-r.  Cats, dogs, little fuzzy bunnies, big mean bears & animals like that have f-u-r.  Even my 7 yr. old knows that.      *EDIT*  What YOU fail to understand is that YOU are basing YOUR opinion on ONE video taken at ONE rodeo by a biased loser whose main goal is to cause trouble.  In other words, YOU are NOT even forming YOUR OWN opinion, YOU are doing NOTHING but parroting someone else's one sided views & opinions. Which is typical for children like you to do. When you grow up & learn how to form YOUR OWN opinion based on FACTS that YOU have gathered ON YOUR OWN, NOT taken from someone else, THEN maybe someone will listen to your ridiculous comments.  But uneducated nonsense is NOT fact & Youtube is NOT even close to being a source of facts or education.  AND HOTSHOTS ARE NOT 6000 VOLTS!!!  SHARK is a lying imbocile.  Show me a video of him using a hotshot on himself & PROVE IT!!  Just as Kevin said, "C" cell batteries CANNOT produce 6000 volts of electricity.  LOOK IT UP YOURSELF & STOP BELIEVING WHAT YOU SEE & HEAR ON YOUTUBE!  You may as well read the tabloids, there is much fact in there as there is on YouTube.      Nobody is going to convince you otherwise, because you are a child & not educated enough to form an INTELLIGENT opinion, but here you go....  The electric chair used to kill people used a MINIMUM of 2000 volts.  A SINGLE "c" cell battery, like those used in flashlights, hotshots, etc. are 1.5 MAXIMUM volts.  That is ONE point FIVE volts.  It would take 4000 "c" cell batteries to generate 6000 volts.  Now, IF 2000 volts of electricity will KILL a human, don't you think that 6000 volts would kill a calf, steer, horse or bull??  THINK ABOUT IT!!!!     DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.....LEAD, do NOT follow!!!!!!!!        *EDIT*  BRAVO John....unfortunately it won't do any good.  This person would rather believe ONE video which was MOST LIKELY doctored & ONE person who knows NOTHING about rodeo or the people who compete or provide livestock.  I would like to see this Hindi person PROVE that ONE SINGLE thing he says has even a microscopic bit of truth.  I could take pitures or video of ANY animal related competition & find ONE SINGLE thing that happened by ACCIDENT & blow it out of proportion by plastering it all over Youtube where where the uneducated, unintelligent go to let people tell them how & what to think.  I think I will go out & find me one of those 6000 volt hot shots though, could save time when having a BBQ.  6000 volts!!!  WHAT A MORON!!!        *EDIT*  What?  She's a kiwi?  Well, I must say, the New Zealander's I know are sure a WHOLE lot more intelligent than this one, FOR SURE!!!  In fact, the New Zealander's I know are surprise surprise Bull riders & bronc riders in RODEO!!!      *EDIT*  Pagan:  you can't be serious!!!  Black Beauty & Ferdinand????  What are you 10?  As for your friend's horse, just because a horse is either ill trained or bad mannered or people shy does NOT automatically say the horse was abused.

I've seen people tie western pleasure horses heads up for several hours prior to riding, so the horse will carry his head low during an event.  Does that mean that every western pleasure rider does the same?  NO, it doesn't.  You can't judge everybody by what a few people do.  I have been to several rodeos in my life and have been in every part of them, including behind the chutes during the rough stock events.  I have never in my 18+ years of riding seen first hand the abuse that you are talking about.  Before you just asume that the videos that you see on you tube are an every rodeo thing, you should pry your *** out of the house and go see one for yourself.  The bulls are bred to buck literally, some of the horses are as well, but most of the horses are ones that could not be broke for one reason or the other.  But one thing that I can guarantee you is that those animals are taken better care of than any of your animals are, they have to be.  To be hauled around the country like they are, they are vaccinated for pretty much everything out there.  I've been to thousands of rodeos through the years, and I've never seen an injury of the rough stock or the cattle, but I've seen horses bow tendons and stuff like that, but never any thing too serious.  I would suggest that you educate yourself before accusing others bases off some video you saw on the internet.    Also, those little hand held prods are ran on a 9V battery and the big cattle prods run on 2 D-Cell batteries, how can either one of those produce 6,000 volts?  The answer is that they can not it is impossible.  I have personally been hit by both of these and they DO NOT HURT, they only surprise you.  If you don't believe me go to a store that sells them and see for yourself!!!!!|`|djmqoFSTaa	This has been covered once today.  Is that where you got your idea for your question?

It's very ignorant to make a judgment on one piece of information without getting the whole story. Too many people one little thing they've seen and make an opinion on it instead of really educating themselves. Like the wild horse roundups. People here one bit of propaganda from the horse interest groups and then start bashing the BLM and whatnot and act like they are experts on the subject.    Those videos from SHARK make me sad, as they show that bad things do sometimes happen at rodeos, but it does not change my opinion of rodeos. I have been to far too many that have been good, and known some great stock contractors, great rodeo participants, great events organizers. I can not and will not condemn rodeos from a few prejudiced videos.  Most stock contractors treat their rodeo stock like they are made of gold, not like what you see in the videos.  You can go to ANY sport though, and find people doing wrong things or cheating.  But that doesn't mean every single person is like that and the group shouldn't be judged for the offenses of a small percentage.    That's the problem with interest groups...they think they are doing something so great but they are so passionate about one side of the coin that they never flip it over and look at the other side. And SO MANY people feed into that. Unfortunately.

Pro Rodeo and breed shows generally have a lot invested in their animals and do not want to see them hurt for any reason. It's the unofficial and high school rodeos that employ untrained and ruthless handlers. Example the PBR bucking bulls are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and are bred to buck, from weanlings they can strap a dummy to them and they'll buck it straight off. Some of them are mean and some are friendly, same with the horses in the pro rodeo. Sure they spur them, but the experienced riders focus more on the movement of their feet and keeping balance than actually spurring. It's style not cruelty that is the focus. I do not support high school rodeo (barrel racing and such is fine) because of the number of injuries sustained because of inexpert trainers and riders.    |`|TDvWWrGlaa	i dont think so  this stuff happens, its not like no one cared for the horse, and the rider that "ran off"? well, you do realize he came down on his neck with a 1000 pound animal on him, that hurts sometimes!  i think bull riding is cruel, its not like it has purpose, but the other events were used because thats range work....realize that these cows treated "cruelly" in rodeos are meat animals for human consumption, and the horses are protected as best possible    if you think a rodeo is cruel, then  cross country is cruel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0jQ1SjFO...  showjumping is cruel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLHH45bID...  dressage is cruel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYAI8a0IV...  riding with bits is cruel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XULdKnF9-...     please, please dont believe everything a biased organization says, riding is dangerous. anyone can capture the most graphic pictures and claim its abuse even if its an isolated incident    EDIT: pagan_(cant see the rest), im not suggesting xc, showjumping, or dressage are cruel. im just demonstarting that bad shots can make even the safest of equestrian events look horrible. honestly, the xc video in particular make rodeos look like rides through fields of flowers, if u watched the vid you would see just how many of those horses came down on their necks and flipped over|`|e10ac013b3bbd69ec05d026985b1aa0faa	Here we go again  Bulls, Steers, Broncs are all raised to do rodeos.

And sharkonline is the most stupidst fake site I have ever seen in my entire life!!!!!!|`|I0nyeHmtaa	I have seen videos like the yours on youtube before and let me say that OPINIONS are like a**holes, everyone has one. I have been around rodeo my whole  life(my Dad is a retired bull rider and I am a barrel racer) and have been competing in them for many years. I don't think rodeos are cruel. I agree with several others, the stock contractors/owners  keep these animals in THE BEST SHAPE. The pictures you showed of the cowboys with the hand held cattle prods are more than likely one of the rider's friends. If the contractor knew it was going on at the time, which I'm sure they didn't, it would have been stopped. Out of all the videos I've seen protesting rodeo they all basically show the same kind of footage in a different order from several years ago.   It is a dangerous sport not only for the animals but for the competitors.  
ZNDqYUwkaa	Well, yes, dogs are pack animals, but are not like wolves. They have evolved from wolves, but so many people don't understand that difference.   Before I help you I will say this:-    With wolves, you can keep them in captivity, treat them like dogs for a few generations and they'll behave like dogs, but when escapes happen, they can, within one generation, revert straight back to true wolf behavior. In all of the wild dog packs all over the world, none have ever reverted back to true wolf behavior. Dogs are different and have developed their own form of communication. It is very similar to that used by wolves, but not the same and not as focused on dominance.    The best thing you can do for your dog is use calming language with her, but dog calming language, not human. By talking to, soothing, stroking a nervous dog, you reinforce the behavior.  When dogs want to calm each other down, they will turn the head away and often yawn or lick the lips. These are all common calming signals between dogs.    When you call your dog, turn your head to the side so that she knows that you mean her no harm when she comes to you. Do the same with training. Most obedience training involves engaging the dog in eye contact, but in nervous cases this can create anxiety and more fear.   When training you can look at your dog, but have your face angled away slightly and pretend to yawn a few times.     Try not to talk to your dog too much, instead use attention when she is calm and relaxed and feeding and walks to give her affection. Human affection makes us feel good, but dog affection makes them feel good.    I've rehabilitated many many rescue dogs that people have got thinking they can give them a better life with lots of love and attention, but this love and attention can only come after the dog has built both trust and respect in you.    Email me if you want to learn more or want me to give you more exercises to help the situation, but handled properly, even the most extreme cases of nerves/anxiety can be rehabilitated.|`|JwYwsrTzaa	Email me, I have a few questions about your situation and would be glad to help you and your dog out.|`|veDvtYhJaa	Well, talk to other trainers in your area.  There can't be "only one" trainer available to you.  Talk to an animal behaviorist.  Ask your vet for a referral to one.

Distinguish between desensitization (gradually building comfort) versus crowding (overwhelming with stimuli).  You need to desensitize.  That's a general overview.    2.  Here are some specific tips:  --get a hold of Karen Overall's relaxation protocol and begin working with that.  That builds a dog's comfort and teaches then to relax (or associate certain things as calming like a special blanket or mat).  --if you're not using a clicker, get clicker savvy.  That will be a quick way to begin training with her.  --minimize the amount of change and environmental stimuli at any one time.  For instance, start by doing training in your house (familiar surrounding) without new people around.  --look for ways to build up her confidence.  Games, tricks, bonding with you.  Anything that allows her to experience "success" (even if it's modest).  Ask her to do stuff you know she can do (even if it's as simple as a "sit" or a palm touch or touching a ball with her paw) and praise and reward.  You want her to get that working with you is fun, good things happen with you and in training.  And ALWAYS end every training session by asking her to do something she can do (so she leaves training feeling confident and positive and always sees training as something good, not something scary).    4.  Another dog?  Can't say.  She may enjoy the company.  Or she may be threatened or just become even more submissive.  At this point, I wouldn't go get another dog, just experiment.  Definitely look for a dog to expose her to who has a good track record around other dogs and is no bigger than she is, ideally smaller.  Try introducing them on her turf (her back yard or the house she lives in) and do it gently (time to sniff and get acclimated) with both on leashes.  The first hint of bad vibes, pull them apart and forget about it.    Get the book "Stress in Dogs" by von Reinhardt and Scholz.  Also take a look at "Control Unleashed" by Leslie McDevitt (it will have the Overall RP in it as well as some other activities).  You might also try experimenting with Tellington Touch as a way of relaxing and destressing your BT.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Routine and fun. Yes, dogs need routine as well. But in that routine, you got to get down her the dogs level and have fun, pats and games, nothing rough. Also toys to chase and to tug on, and let him win - let him gain some confidence with you.   Do try not to raise your voice around him, but he will gain confidence if you have routine. he knows whats coming everyday and what to expect. So a walk and play in the morning, brekky for him at the same time as you, say your goodbyes, when you get back, games and play. then he gets a treat as you study/cook dinner. then cuddle times in front of tv for the night. And try to do it around the same times everyday. And he'll gain respect and expectations of you and confidence in your behaviour.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Getting an adult who is quiet and gentle might be a good thing, but remember any adult you bring in is going to come with their own 'baggage' and you will have to spend time settling the new dog into your regime which perhaps isn't what is going to help your nervous girl.  You might try (and I can believe I'm suggesting this really lol) adding some Bachs Rescue Remedy into her water.  If she has been with your for nearly a year, that's a long time for her still to be showing these problems so she must have been badly traumatised (although you are right, she may not be the most outgoing of girls to begin with).  When things get noisy around your place, have you considered using a crate for her.  If you cover the top and three sides, this would become her little den, her bolt hole and might give her a secure base.    The worst part about being nervous like this is the risk of her being really spooked, and it turning into fear biting.    Talk to your vet or, if you can, Border Terrier breeders (did you get her from BT Rescue?).  Often people who know their breed inside out, can be extremely useful.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	give her time you don't know what she s been through before you got her just give her plenty of love and patience and training in short sessions until she gets her confidence|`|AA11097657	I have rescued many nervous dogs and find they cope well alongside a confident older dog.

Look in the yellow pages for Dog Training Clubs that run clicker training classes.   Agility training for fun will also help you bond with her and make her more confident in you.|`|xhxnvPczaa	i would say try getting another rescue dog friend
ejodXS5naa	The short answer is that infrared can certainly hurt a cat's eyes, and also a human's eyes.  I doubt your device can do either.  But let me give you a few words of caution.  First, your cigarette test is laughable.  That is no way to test for infrared.  A cigarette doesn't care what kind of light you shine on it.  It only cares how much light you shine on it.  So if you shine enough visible light on it, it will light up.  If you shine an equal amount of infrared on it, it will light up.  Makes no difference to the cigarette what.    But you should have realized that the amount of light (visible or infrared) that it takes to burn a cigarette is monumentally more than the amount of light it takes to burn a retina in an eye.  So if your infrared light could burn a cigarette, it would be hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than it would need to be to instantly blind you or your cat, if it were to get in either of your eyes.  And, as an extension, if your infrared source is not powerful enough to burn a cigarette, it may still have much more power than it would need to fry an eye.    In fact, infrared light is more dangerous than visible light because with visible light you have a blink reflex that causes you to look away from it, minimizing damage.  But infrared is invisible and does not trigger that blink reflex.  So you can stare happily into infrared light and you wont know that you are being blinded until you lose you vision.  How long that will take will depend on how powerful the light source is.  If the light source is powerful enough to light a match, that will take a few nanosecond, much faster than you would have been able to blink anyways.  But if it is a weak source, it may take a few seconds.  You apparently don't know how powerful your source is, so there is no way of knowing how quickly it would blind you, but you should assume that it is instantaneous.    The only thing that is saving you is that most companies will not sell devices that can blind people due to possible law suits.  But some companies do.  And no company is going to worry about whether or not their product will blind cats (whose eyes are more sensitive), since cat's don't sue.      The bottom line is that I doubt this is a problem, but if it is a problem, it would be a serious problem, so I would not recommend continuing using your source.  By the way, infrared lasers cause more laser-related eye injuries than visible lasers for exactly the reasons I stated.  So do not take infrared light lightly.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	Point that infared pointer into your eyes, just for a second or two, notice how you can not see for some time after. A cat's eyes are more sensitive than yours so yes it can damage the cat's eyes. A seconds flash would not blind the thing just avoid it as much as possible. My cat's love that darn spot, move the pointer and it makes a distinctive rattle sound to them, they know it because they immediatly start looking for the red spot.    Look at any light directly and you will notice blind spots after so do not put that laser pointer light or any light directly into their eyes.|`|b20518aff8ed05a57be53803c67262afaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_point...  http://www.azooptics.com/Details.asp?Art...

6KxBqnstaa	Put the heat up to at least 68-70 degrees. Put a cover over half of his cage not just the top. Put a heating pad set on low under the bottom of  his cage. (outside bottom).

You really should try to get him in to a good avian vet asap.  In the meantime, there are a few things you can do that may help.  Covering the cage is good but you don't need to cover it totally.  That will make him feel he is being abandoned when he doesn't feel well and that could cause more stress.  You want to keep him as quiet and stress free as possible.  He needs supplemental heat also.  67 is too cold for him right now.  You can put a heating pad, on low, under only the rear half of his cage.  Only under half because he needs to be able to move away from the heat if he needs to.  Getting over heated can be as bad as getting chilled.  Cover only the top and three sides of his cage.  If he is sitting on the floor of the cage, that means he really doesn't feel well.  Put his food and water on the floor so he can get it without having to climb.  Offering some Pedialyte in a third bowl would be great.  If he will take some, it will help keep him hydrated and will help balance his electrolytes.

uhlPVTdkaa	AWW yes they would definitely be a good match.|`|VQX9e0mxaa	since KCS are toy breeds, they arent really meant for being rowdy. if ur lab has a good calm temperement, than a KCS would be a great choice. but it really depends on what your lab is like, or else id recommend a bigger dog, around the size of your lab. i mean, labs are around 50+ pounds and KCS are only around 20, so theres quite a bit of weight difference, so choose carefully!! or you could go 2 a shelter, because they have some KCS mixes that are a bit larger and might be a better choice!|`|t0K6Haoyaa	bring one around to see how your lab reacts.|`|OrvTG44laa	It depends on your lab's energy level.

Maybe you could limit his water after say 7pm?|`|q0rLBQo2aa	Let him pee on the floor.<br>  <br>  Actually, that's not a totally wise-*** answer. Going out that soon is more habit and restlessness than a true need and full bladder. If the dog is reliably house-trained, it will not want to pee indoors, so if you just ignore it, it will eventually give up "asking" to be taken out. Same technique as a kid who doesn't want to go to bed on time. Let 'em cry, once you're SURE there is not some genuine physical abnormality that creates a real danger. It's difficult to be hard-hearted and put up with the annoyance, but if you win the test of wills it's better for everyone in the long run.|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	You don't mention how old your dog is or how long you've had him?  Regardless, you definitely want to take him out just before going to bed and perhaps limit his water intake during the later part of the evening.  As long as you feed him earlier in the day, his quench for water will be less later at night if he has satisfied his thirst earlier. I have noticed my dog will be thirsty for several hours after he eats, so that may be one suggestion.  Another is maybe your dog needs to go out more often during the day and as I said above, make sure he goes out right before bedtime and that might just do it for you.|`|H1tokn4uaa	If he is over 6 mongths of age, he is capable of holding it all night long.  My first suggestion is to crate your dog and have trhee sleepless nights.  Now, you should know some things about the crate for now.  1) It should only be large enough for him to stand up, turn around, and lay down.  2)  There should not be any blankets in there for him.  If there are blankets, he's going to eliminate and kick his blanket to the side.  He's just flushed his toilet and can now have an excellent night while you have a fun morning to clean up his mess.<br>  <br>    My second suggestion would be to remove his waterat 8 o'clock and put down ice cubes so that he can stay hydrated.  If you dog pees in the crate just to drink it he's probably dehydrated, and consuming his urine will give him a UTI.<br>  <br>  Even if he does not drink his urine, it's still possible he has a UTI and should be treated as soon as possible.  I hope all is well and hopefully you'll buy some earplugs before before 10 o'clock tonight.|`|lKbNLrRPaa	take him outside as soon as you wake up, and before he goes to bed. only tell him off when you see him weeing in the house, otherwise he won't understand what he's done. praise him for doing his buisness outside.|`|bBxz2UAwaa	do you have your dog in a kennel at night?

MNLbVQ2kaa	House Training Rule Number One: This is The Most Important Rule – If you don't catch your puppy doing it - then don't punish him for it!<br>  <br>  House Training Rule Number Two: Praise your puppy when things go right. Don't let this be a situation where your only action is saying "No" when they are caught in the midst of using the wrong area. If they do it right – let them know!<br>  <br>  Methods of house training <br>  <br>  Starting Inside: There are several ways to housebreak a puppy. With the first, you can put down papers or pretreated pads, encouraging them to use these areas for going to the bathroom. The pads are scented with a chemical that attracts the puppy to use them. Whenever you see them starting into their "pre-potty pattern," such as walking around and sniffing the floor, you gently pick them up without talking and carry them over to the papers/pad and then praise them when they go to the bathroom (Rule 2).<br>  <br>  When all goes well and they are using the papers consistently, the papers are either moved closer to the door and/or another set is placed outside. The transition is made from concentrating the toilet habits to one spot inside the home to one spot outside the home. Finally, the papers inside are eliminated. The only problem with this method is that for a period of time it encourages the animal to eliminate inside the home. In our experience, house training may take longer when this method is used.<br>  <br>   Crate Training: The second popular method of house training involves the use of a crate or cage. The often-stated reasoning is that the animal is placed in a cage that is just large enough to be a bed. Dogs do not like to soil their beds because they would be forced to lay in the mess. It works, and while in these confines, most pups will control their bladder and bowels for a longer time than we would expect. Young puppies, at 8 or 9 weeks of age can often last for 7 or 8 hours, however, we would never recommend leaving them unattended in a crate for that long in most circumstances.<br>  <br>  During housebreaking, whenever the puppy is inside the home but cannot be watched, he is placed in the crate. This might be while you are cooking, reading to the children, or even away from the home. The last thing you do before you put the puppy in the crate is take him outside to his favorite spot. The first thing you do when you take the animal out of the crate is another trip outside. No food or water goes in the crate, just a blanket and maybe a chew toy to occupy his time. Overnight is definitely crate time. As your faith in the puppy grows, leave him out for longer and longer periods of time.<br>  <br>  Most people do not recognize an important advantage of crate training. It does more than just stop the animal from messing in the house. It also teaches the puppy something very important. The puppy learns that when the urge to urinate or defecate occurs, he can hold it. Just because the pup feels like he needs to relieve himself, the pup learns that he does not have to. This is thought to be the main reason why puppies that have gone through crate training have fewer mistakes later on.<br>  <br>  Make sure you buy the right size cage. You want one that has the floor space that provides just enough for the puppy to lie down. But cages are useful throughout a dog's life and it would be nice if you did not have to keep buying more as he grows. That is not necessary. Simply purchase a cage that will be big enough for him as an adult, but choose a model that comes with or has a divider panel as an accessory. With these, you can adjust the position of the panel so that the space inside the cage available to the pet can grow as he does.<br>  <br>  Using too large of a crate can often cause long term problems. The puppy will go to one corner of the cage and urinate or defecate. After a while, he will then run through it tracking it all over the cage. If this is allowed to continue, the instincts about not soiling his bed or lying in the mess will be forgotten and the puppy will soon be doing it every day when placed in the crate. Now a house training method has turned into a behavioral problem as the puppy’s newly-formed hygienic habits becomes his way of life.<br>  <br>  Constant Supervision: The last method involves no papers, pads, or crates. Rather, you chose to spend all the time necessary with the puppy. This works very well for people who live and work in their homes, retired persons, or in situations where the owners are always with the animal. Whenever they see the puppy doing his "pre-potty pattern" they hustle him outside. It is important that the dog is watched at all times and that no mistakes are allowed to occur. This method has less room for error, as there is nothing like a cage to restrict the animal's urges, nor is there a place for him to relieve himself such as on the papers or pad. When he is taken outside, watch the puppy closely and as soon as all goes as planned, he should be praised and then brought back inside immediately. You want|`|TnHl3Heoaa	Crate training is my favourite method. <br>  It teaches the dog to hold it and wait for you instead of making you let it out whenever it wants.<br>  <br>  the puppy is kept in his/her crate for most of the day at first. It is taken out at intervals (including after feeding) to go outside and is praised and rewarded with playtime when he/she does so.<br>  if an accident occurs in the cage the "mess" is shown to the ppup with a firm but gentle "no" then the dog is put outside while you clean up the cage<br>  time spent outside the crate gets longer as the puppy learns to hold it until you let him/her outside. soon enough the crate wont be necesary and the dog will know to wait until you let him/her out, keep a steady schedule and you and your dog will be happy|`|TBj0xAOFaa	Crate training works great if done correctly. Praise your dog for going outside "rubbing a pups nose" isn't going to work & will be detrimental to training. You need to keep the puppy where you can see him all the time so there are no accidents in another area. Take your pup out often especially after: eating, playing, big drinks, naps, & straight out of the crate. A pup can hold it for 1 hour for every month of age-this is important to keep in mind while training. Make a schedule & stick to it as much as possible for feeding-this will go a long way.<br>  You do not need to keep him in the crate all the time, only when you can't keep a close eye on him which shouldn't be very often & don't use the crate as a punishment. <br>  Consistency, praise, & patients are the keys to potty training.|`|OmAU6RDcaa	One of my dogs was very hard to train.  He finally learned very quickly by watching our friend's dog ask to go out and pee.  Persistance and consistancy is the key.  Keep checking if he/she has to go.

3EaFjsA8aa	I run Ohio Jack Russell Rescue. Yes, there is a such thing as a Lazy JRT. <br>  <br>  People like to stereo type things... "all Pit Bulls are aggressive" "all JRT's are crazy hyper" "all people with blonde hair are dizzy"  You get what I mean.  Just not true.<br>  <br>  A JRT that was breed to be a companion house dog should be a little more mellow.  A JRT that has been trained properly will be more mellow.<br>  <br>  I would say out of the 100 JRT's I save every year... I have 4 or 5 hyper annoying ones but after training they aren't so bad.<br>  <br>  Now I am not sure where you got your dog or when the last time he/she saw a vet but if you just got him / her from a back yard breeder (meaning not registered with JRTCA), puppy mill or pet store I would have him checked for health issues.|`|3HNXdmFmaa	I have never heard of a lazy one year-old Jack Russell either.  Did you get him from a shelter, pet store, breeder, friend or as a stray?  I ask because I wonder whether you were given correct information about his age or breed.  If he's a shelter dog, the breed and age were probably educated guesses, and they are sometimes wrong.  Do you know his  history before you got him?<br>  <br>  If you don't know his history, and because he should get a check up every year anyway, I'd recommend having him looked at by a vet.  There are several things than can cause lethargy in a dog that otherwise appears perfectly healthy.  Two possible causes that come immediately to mind are a heart murmur or anemia.  I've seen both of these in young dogs and they just sap them of energy.  Only a vet will be able to diagnose him.  While you're there, and if you don't know for sure, you might ask the vet to age him by his teeth.  Perhaps if he is from a shelter, he is older than they thought.<br>  <br>  It might be nothing, but I prefer to err on the side of caution.|`|CzNxbsmsaa	I've never heard of a jack russell doing anything even close to that.My friend has 3 of them and even when they came back from the vets after being fixed they were wide open.I would at least call the vet and ask about that to be safe.Good Luck!<br>  PS You'll probably be praying for your jack to chill out when he/she gets over this!|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	It could be that his old owner would sleep in and the dog adapted to the schedule of his old owner.

jA1nfMeyaa	Make them meet in neutral territory and let them go on a walk together.<br>  <br>  Do not allow them to meet in a place that is already familiar to one of the dogs.  Keep the dogs leashed when they are first introduced, but don't put any tension on the leash and make sure that you and the other person handling the other dog are relaxed.  If the dogs ignore each other that is wonderful.  If the dogs are interested allow them to sniff around a bit, but don't encourage anything more than that.  Walk the two dogs together and after wearing them out allow them to meet again in neutral territory.  See how they react to each other, watch for tense body signals.  If they are relaxed and in a playful mood allow them to get to know each other more.  If they're still tense around each other continue introducing them in neutral territory and walking them together.  Eventually they'll start associating each other with good things: walks.<br>  <br>  Because of the size difference I would not recommend leaving the two dogs unsupervised together during the first couple of months of knowing each other.|`|knFrwCxcaa	I have four dogs 2 from different places one thing i have learned from 4 years of experience is NEVER to let them meet in the house because its in there own territory that best place is up a quiet filed and then if they get along take them back to the house together DO NOT give more attention to one and not the other that's asking them to fight let them meet on the lead and if tails start wagging then let them off the lead<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|DO2eXSzDaa	Let them both meet on a walk..<br>  At first keep them on short leads<br>  then longer leads<br>  and when the are ok with each other let them off..<br>  <br>  Then both walk the 2 dogs back to your house and just take it from there..<br>  <br>  If they r both friendly dogs then they should b ok together|`|B0hTxUnCaa	muzzle both put both on a light leash and let them run in an open space pull away if they start to try to fight they cant hurt each other cause the muzzles|`|TnHl3Heoaa	very carefully<br>  is the lab/shepheard an agressive dog? if so this could be more difficult, as the chihuahua wont take it.<br>  <br>  put the two dogs in a room that one of them is familiar with (the living room or something else in its normal living area)<br>  BE CALM the dogs will sense if you are nervous and will become agitated more easely<br>  let them discover eachother. some bum-sniffing is gonna happen and perhaps a test for dominance if  Lucy thinks she can take over.

For most dogs muzzles and leashes are unnecessary but if they have a history of biting then take necessary precautions. Do  not do it if you feel anxious,your dog will pick up on that and become anxious herself. When you feel confident they will,it shouldn't be a problem.|`|tgCUDJEJaa	when they meet, make sure you're relaxed, dogs seem to sense nervousness, like a 6th sense to them<br>  <br>  also, associate positive things when they meet,<br>  for example, if your dog loves food, feed it treats, if it loves toys, bring along a toy or chew etc<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|lzjtINvCaa	just take them out on a walk each of you with your dog on a leash let them smell butts and become friends then take them home together.|`|QUkXsPNIaa	Put up a partition between them (maybe one dog on one side of a doggie gate and the other dog on the side)<br>  <br>  Some kind of partition that allows them to see and sniff each other, but still keeps them "apart". <br>  <br>  Let them get to know each other through the gate for at least a couple of hours, until they are both calm and relaxed with the other.<br>  <br>  Then, with you keeping a very close on them, allow them to meet. praise good behaviour and scold bad behaviour.<br>  <br>  Supervision is key. Chi's are so small, any roughness can cause damage. Allow them to behave normally, but step in if your doubt one's safety.
C1eHfhrHaa	You have to buy a certain type of wire that is sold at hardware stores and pet stores.

AA11131305	My family dealt with this when we first got our dog. My parents are school teachers and my brother and I were both in school. We got her during the summer so we could spend time with her and get her potty trained. Then once the school year started, we caged her for about the time you're talking about. She did great; she cried like crazy but got over it soon.<br>  <br>  When she passed away, we got another dog. At this point, I was living at home for my last semester of college, my brother was home a lot, and my dad was retired. The next puppy never had to be in the cage hardly at all, which turned out to be a big mistake because she had the toughest time being potty trained.<br>  <br>  When I moved out, I got a dog (btw, all three of these dogs were mini dachshund girls). Because I didn't have a choice whether to leave her in the cage or not (it was just me at this point), I had to crate train her because of working 8-5 everyday. I put a puppy pad in her cage during the day with some room for her to go, then I would take her out as soon as I got home. She did VERY well with this. <br>  <br>  Even though it's hard, crate training in the best. If you're going to leave the dog alone, don't allow it to run around while you're gone. They will just create messes.|`|iasOicRjaa	I love the idea of waiting until summer so you can spend plenty of time with him. Assuming you get a pup at the right age (8weeks) he will be 5 months old by the time you start school again and will tolerate being alone much better than an 8 week old will. Plus you will have time to help him get used to his crate and house trained. Puppies are soooo cute and fun! Good luck!|`|S0K6OqGJaa	summer would most likely be the best time to get it. first off you deff will need to crate train your puppy, its the best way to potty train them, i have a 8 month old beagle i got her when she was 8 weeks i didnt want to crate train her bc i thought it was mean but she keep having acidents. se gets put in the crate every time we go out and she did for one week when she ferst got the crate at bed time after the week she was potty trained and sleeps in bed with me and my hubby now. <br>  <br>  puppies could not be left home for long periods of A general rule of thumb is that a puppy can "hold it" for as many hours as they are months old. Using that generalization, an 8 week old puppy should be able to potty (somehow) every few hours.<br>  its completely up to you wat you want to do but a puppy is real hard work good luck when you get one|`|z4Huew1daa	either get one in the summer or jus leave it in a pen with toys food and water thats wat i do and my dog is fine with it. or do u hav any cats or anything thats another thing i do i leave my cats in the pen with the puppy so that he has some company while ikm at scool 9:10- 3:20|`|t3sIXk9uaa	if you are not sure if this is a good time to get a puppy then more than likely now is not a good time.  if you got a puppy during the summer fact that would be a better idea due to the fact that you would be home more.  a puppy needs to be on a schedule when it comes to potty training and the fact that you are gone all day makes it had for that to happen|`|H7HZXTaWaa	I would recommend waiting until summer, it will give you more time to train the pup.

0m6BgESXaa	First of all, it's Shepherd ;-)<br>  <br>  The easiest way to train it is to teach a "leave it" command.  It's not a hard thing to teach.  Just put the dog on leash, have several people come and leave, and allow the dog to go to the door and bark a couple times, and then say "Leave it" or "that's enough" and call them away. <br>  <br>  When the dog returns to you (which he will because he's on leash) reward heavily and praise.<br>  <br>  My dogs of course alert me when people come to the door, and I allow them to bark until I see who it is.  Once I know it's somebody that can come in, I say "Thank you!  That's enough!" and the happily welcome whoever it is inside.|`|SJGDtWROaa	I have a 3 year old yorkie and how we trained her to stop barking was to squirt her with a water bottle (filled with just water obviously) every time she barked.

3rc9ra35aa	Technically if you sign the contract and then break one of the agreements you could be held responsible. Does this happen very often? Definitly not. In order for a breeder to recieve any compensation they would first have to be able to prove that you broke the contract. How would they know what food you feed unless you admit it? Plus, they would have to take you to small claims court. Small claims must go to trial where the defendent lives. This means the breeder would have to travel to where ever the new owner lives and take time out of thier schedule to try and get compensation from the new owner for whatever the contract states. Would a breeder ever take someone to court for not feeding premium food? I highly doubt it and I sure hope not. What a waste of tax payers money if they did. It would be very rare for a breeder to take someone to court and would most likely only be in a case of puppy abuse. The contracts basically mean nothing when it comes right down to it. They are just a means of trying to get people to be responsible.<br>  ----I have never come across a contract that stated such a thing regarding litigation be held in state of purchase but it is not surprising. personally I would never sign such a contract. This is violating your right as a consumer. I would also never sign a contract with too many silly stipulations. It comes down to how much you want the dog but you do need to protect you and your rights first. You wont want your dog to be taken away if you dont feed it a specific brand of dog food. Especially since one specific brand will not agree with every dog. Any breeder who states this is most likely associated and recieving commission from the dog food company. Basically, you will never hear from most breeders again after your pup is 6 months to a year. They can't keep track of where everyone who has purchased a pup from them is currently living and what they are doing.<br>  ---You may be thinking of a different term? Lemon laws protect the consumer, not the seller. Hence the word 'lemon' as in 'I was sold a lemon' wich means a defective item/bad purchase. A breeders rights will largely depend on the individual's contract. Most contracts will state specific genetic defects that are covered as well as ones that are not such as cherry eye. If the dog does get sick most contracts state 2 to 3 vets must confirm the diagnosis. Usually feeding bad dog food would be the new owners fault and the breeder would not be at fault but it must be proven that the 'bad' dog food caused the issue. This could be very hard to do.Usually no matter how bad the dog food is it would not kill the dog. If it did the owner could take things up against the dog food company. Dog food cannot cause a genetic deffect. It may not help in such a situation as not feeding large breed puppy food to a large breed puppy but if the dog is going to get hip displaysia it will get it no matter what food it eats. It may just happen sooner. If it can be proven that the puppy grew too fast because it was not fed large breed food then the breeder may not have to honor a contract that guarantees the pup against hip displaysia. However, it may depend on your vet vs the puppy's vet and how far these people and you are willing to go. Also is your vet/their vet willing to testify for you. Most wont unless it is an abuse case.|`|TnHl3Heoaa	most contracts wont tell you what brand you must feed the dog. thats just rediculous. <br>  The contract does become a legal contract once signed. so read it carefully before you apply your signature. <br>  standard items include a spay/neuter contract or if breeding rights are included the contract may demand that the dog is breed only with dogs that meet the standard.<br>  It may aslo demand that you keep the dog for the entirety of its life.|`|Bw18seFqaa	depends on what the contract says...  some breeders can sue the owner for breach of contract.. some do have rights to take the dog back, it just depends on what's written in the contract!|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	A contract is a contract.
