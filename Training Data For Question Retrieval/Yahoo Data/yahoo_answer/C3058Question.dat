20090304221020AAbg5HA	Local Businesses;Other - Local Businesses	Should I be worried?~~~~~~~?	had a package from Hong Kong sent out on the 26th, I was given a tracking number. I been trying to check it but all I get is this.      "Status: Foreign International Dispatch      "Your item left HONG KONG AIR MAIL CENTRE, HONG KONG on February 27, 2009. Information, if available, is updated every evening. Please check again later"      That is all it's been saying, no updates, I contacted the seller but no answer yet, I need this package at least before April.      I had another package, I got it today come from Hong Kong, it was shipped with EMS shipping, I was able to track that. The other one I am waiting for was shipped by Registered International Air Mail.       Could it have to do with how it is shipped? I am just hoping it's not stuck and sitting somewhere.      Thanks~

Sono tanti i motivi uno di questi è sicuramente il colore della pelle che non và a genio a persone che della vita credono di aver capito tutto ma che in realtà  hanno appena imparato a camminare a gattoni !    Mettere in vigore leggi per far chiudere dei lavoratori che lavorano più di 12 ore al giorno e che danno la possibilità  di tenere i rapporti con la propria famiglia dall'altra parte del mondo a prezzi convenienti per le loro tasche credo non sIA UMANO....   CIRCA 2.000 PHONE CENTER CHIUDERANNO PERCHè LA LEGGE RICHIEDE DUE BAGNI PUBBLICI ...!      E LE CABINE TELECOM IN MEZZO ALLA STRADA DOVE LO METTONO????????????      QUELLE NON SI TOCCANO SONO DI TRONCHETTI PROVERA VERO????      GRAZIE ITALIA !
