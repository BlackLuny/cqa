LQdaMMCCaa	There are many revision methods, but you should use which suits you the most. I usually make a formula sheet and write all the formulas. But some mathematical problems are not just based on formulas. So you have to develop your reasoning. When solving problems, go step by step, do not try to skip some steps and rush to the answer. If you want to improve your mathematical skills, you must know what you are doing when you are solving problems and why you are doing. If you are stuck with some problem on an exam,  do not waste all of your time on it, try the next ones and then when you are done, try that one. If you are stuck during practice(not during exam), then try to find a similar solved problem, understand the solved problem and then try to do it. My personal experience says that you just can not learn maths with the help of some other person or some book. You have to study it yourself so that you can understand the concepts clearly. But this does not mean that you should not take help from others, you can. But the thing is that if you do it yourself then the concepts become clear and concrete in your mind.<br>  <br>  To calm yourself, take deep breaths and close your eyes and do not move. If your brain is really messed up after solving some math problems, give yourself a break. But during the exam, you can just take deep breaths or maybe drink some water because you do not want to waste your time during exam by taking breaks.|`|edlH0wPNaa	maths on youtube

I know how student loans go - again they think my parents just have even 10,000 to help me out, but nope i'm the typical starving college kid because all my money is going to school. anyways, if need be, take one semester off, but just make sure you go back. just to get it and be done. there is nothing worse than your parents saying they're not mad just disappointed...<br>  good luck, hope you get the money and decide to return.

There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal.

Better nutrition means more resistance to disease. Better education and birth control lead to delayed child bearing so women have fewer children and are less likely to die in childbirth.  Smaller families mean parents can devote more resources to each child so children grow up healthier.

u8CFwtyMaa	Judging by some of the questions, and answers, posted on this site, it's not just the young people, a huge number of spelling and grammatical errors are being made by people of all ages.<br>  There really is no excuse for it as Yahoo has a spellchecker built into it, although this doesn't seem to operate when I access the site from my phone.<br>  I don't know if it's text messaging to blame, or if it's a decline in teaching standards, or general apathy towards correctness.<br>  Hope this helps|`|HAHDipTAaa	Having looked at the spelling on YH I find that even with a spell checker there are people who just have no interest in spelling correctly. I really think that these days it is not an important issue in their minds. It annoys me when I see words like "definitely" spelled "definately" and there are so many that I can't put them all here.<br>  <br>  Of course it doesn't help when the YH spell checker spells in "English-American" putting in far too many "zeds" in words like "realise" and "socialise" and leaving out the "u" in humour or colour. But does it matter - I guess not!|`|CfjxKLHDaa	As you text message more and more, whether you young or old, you are not properly communicating.  Text messaging is not formal writing and it should not be used at all unless it is used for emergencies.  You need to take the time to write properly on a word document and then cut and paste into your email or internet inbox especially when you are communicating on a public forum like Yahoo Answer.  Text messaging just shows how lazy you are or you your lack of education.<br>  <br>  First, let me emphasize why all of us need to write properly.  We all need to write in order to formally communicate with people and various organizations (government, private-sector, non-profit, religions, etc.).  This applies to everyone (hamburger flippers, pizza deliverers, beauticians, farmers, waitresses, carpenters, gas station attendants, truck drivers, chefs, etc.) and not just college graduates (scientists, engineers, technicians, doctors, business mangers, accountants, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Second, fundamental to good writing is grammar.  I don’t believe enough emphasis is being put on the importance of grammar in our schools.  Most US schools do not have a systematic process for teaching grammar for grades 4 through 12.  But that is no excuse.  There are a lot of good easy to read and practice grammar books.  I also suggest you use a grammar handbook titled "Ntty-Gitty Grammar, A Not-So-Serious Guide to Clear Communication (by Edith H. Fine and Judith P. Josephson)" as a reference text.<br>  <br>  Third, good writing forces you to think because it involves research and revaluation when writing.  Good writing is used through out life in the form of business letters, formal emails, trip reports, test or engineering reports, formal presentations, academic reports or summaries, thesis, summaries in general, and even personal writing.  With proper writing, anyone can easily advance to other styles of writing such as writing fiction or non-fiction books, screenplays for movies, and plays.<br>  <br>  Again for public forums like Yahoo Answer, you should not answer questions when you are on the bus or on the go.  Sit down on you computer and write the answer on a word document.  Check for spelling and grammar.<br>  <br>  You want to talk to your friend or mate then call him or her like real human beings do.  Of course, there are exceptions but they are far and few.<br>  <br>  I can’t emphasize again on the necessity of good writing.  You need it and our modern world needs it.  Once you have mastered this basic need, you will have a high probability of not failing in life.  You can tackle almost any subject because it forces you to read\research, understand what was read, organize the contents to be summarized in your head, and put it down on paper in a presentable summary or answer.   As I end this, let me quote from a teacher “reading is passive communication and writing is active communication”.|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	i think so, because me sometimes i try to spell like in slang kind of words in my essays or stuff, but that only happened once in a loonnng time, so its something you dont have to worry about.<br>  Like im a good speller, and i dont usually type like this, i usually type like; THiS y00h kN0W WUt i MEAN..<br>  S0 iT d0SN'T AffECt y00h REALLy MUChh THAt f0' Sh0W..<br>  =)<br>  So, there you have it.|`|KlXDXlFvaa	Yes.|`|DbFHpCtyaa	No. \o/

It begins with Westmoreland saying he wishes there were more Englishmen to fight the battle. henry says 'Westy, if we're gonna die, there are plenty here to do it, if we live, there are fewer to who have to share the glory. I'm not greedy about many things - but if it's bad to want honor, then I'm b-a-a-a-a-a-d, 'cause I wouldn't share the glory we'll earn with one more soul. You go out there and tell my troops that anybody who is feeling shaky should flee - I'll give him a pass and money too. I won't die with any such man around me. Anyone who lives through today will stand taller whenever it is spoken of; each year on  the anniversary he'll show his scars and say where he earned them - he'll describe his deeds with a little embellishment; the names of legends such as Henry Exeter, etc. will be familiar to him, and he'll toast them; this will be his legacy to his sons; and as long as men remember, St. Crispian's will be to, and the brothers (for all who are with me now are my brothers - no matter how lowly).

In answer to Westmoreland, Henry says that if God plans for them to win, there will be greater glory with no more troops than these to share the honors with. He urges anyone who does not wish to fight to leave. Today is a day set aside for the celebration of the "Feast of Saint Crispian," and all of those English soldiers who survive the battle will be honored and remembered every Saint Crispian's Day. Henry promises that all of their names shall become household words and their deeds remembered "to the ending of the world." Every Englishman who fights with him shall be his brother, and all Englishmen who do not take part in the battle will hold their manhoods cheap on Saint Crispian's Day.<br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/Henry-V-Summary-Analysis-and-Original-Text-by-Scene-Act-IV-Scene-3.id-13,pageNum-149.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a>

fPOg9DuXaa	1. I teach 19 third graders. My duties include: teaching them language arts (reading/writing), English (their first language is Spanish) and math. I also need to teach them basic life skills like manners, respect, how to get along with eachother and responsibility. I also strive to keep them safe. My job includes a lot of paperwork and meetings. <br>  My favorite part of my job is when I get to really talk to the kids, especially one on one after school/ at recess, etc. Very rarely do I actually get to know them because the school day is so busy. <br>  My least favorite part of my job is the grading and report cards, etc. We don't get paid for all of this extra after school stuff. <br>  <br>  2. I did choose this job. I told my mom I wanted to be a teacher when I was in the first grade. I really admired and looked up to my teachers and wanted to be one. No one else in my family does this job. <br>  <br>  3. I have considered other career paths and may still try them out one day. I believe teaching is a very stressful job with very long hours. Sometimes I just want a job that I can leave at work. <br>  <br>  4. I had to go to school for four years. I took out student loans and received grants for my schooling. I am still paying back my loans and it is very difficult financially right now. <br>  <br>  5. Yes, my family respects my profession. My mom always buys me children's books at garage sales for my classroom library. :) <br>  <br>  6. It is the job I expected it to be. I never thought it was going to be easy. I guess I never realized that it was going to have so many politics involved. There are a lot of arguements about the best way of doing things, etc. It also tends to sometimes be competitive. Those are things I didn't expect. <br>  <br>  7. I would recommend others to this line of work if they really had a passion for it. If you don't have a passion for it, it won't be worth it. My pay is okay. I have great benefits including health and dental insurance. I have a retirement set up. <br>  <br>  8. I started teaching straight out of college, but I did do lots of little jobs while in college and in the summers including: working in the mail room at my college, working in human resources at my college, working as a counselor at a summer camp, working as a recreational leader at a city park. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! :) Good luck!!!

If you haven't finished yet come back after 15 minutes and do another 15 minutes of homework.<br>  <br>  make a routine for yourself that you get home, have a bite to eat (if your hungry) and do your homework straight away, because once it's done, it's done. Nothing is going to undo it. Then you can enjoy your time afterwards without feeling bad about not doing your homework.<br>  <br>  you can do anything for 15 minutes!!!
s1xoaIBAaa	Big question, there have been multiple books written about this topic.<br>  <br>  In short, Charlemagne presided over what is known as the Carolingian Renaissance. He collected at his court the best and brightest scholars of the age, led by Alcuin of York. These scholars looked by to the Roman Empire for inspiration. They made reforms in several areas.<br>  <br>  In script they developed what is known as the Carolingian minuscule. This was a clear, easy to read script that included both upper an lower case letters. Later scripts become much more difficult to read. When the humanist of the 15th century Renaissance were looking for ancient texts, they adopted the Carolingian minuscule, thinking that it represented ancient Roman script. Since printing was becoming widespread at the time, many early printers adopted this minuscule for their work. They are basically the same letters we use today.<br>  <br>  They collected and copied ancients texts. There are very few ancient texts that have extant copies older than the Carolingian copies. Most of what we know of classical literature comes to us through Carolingian copies.<br>  <br>  Latin of the era was beginning to diverge into the various and Romance languages. To combat this, Charlemagne established schools, where higher standards of Latin could be kept. His scholars developed a standardized curriculum which reestablished the trivium and quadrivium as the basis of education. These schools increased the number of literate people available for posts in the Church. This was vital as there had previously been a shortage of men able to read Latin well enough to understand the Vulgate Bible or correctly perform the Latin liturgy.<br>  <br>  There was much regional variation in the way church services were performed. Charlemagne had the liturgy as practiced at Rome made standard throughout his Empire. Except for some very minor variations, this was the liturgy used throughout Europe until the Council of Trent in the 16th century.
XEzSAErkaa	The economic changes brought about by increased trade and the emergence of cities created new tensions in medieval society. These tensions permeated the boundaries of class, gender, ethnicity, and religion. The interaction between rural and urban classes led to the establishment of new political organizations and laws designed to balance the needs of competing classes.<br>  <br>  As towns emerged, new social classes—such as merchants and artisans—disrupted the established social patterns of medieval society. According to the traditional view, three orders worked together in the rural community: the warrior aristocracy, or people who fight; the peasantry, or people who work; and the clergy, or people who pray. These traditional communities were organized in a hierarchy and bound together like a family, with the noble acting as a father figure over his household and the village inhabitants. Townspeople, who earned their living through crafts or commerce, broke from these rural obligations and familial ties, so they created new social networks through associations called guilds. Merchant guilds protected the town's interests by regulating trade with outsiders and providing benefits for members. Craft guilds organized by tanners, butchers, and weavers set wage and price controls and established rules for apprenticeship and membership. To some religious writers, the urban freedoms of the newly chartered towns seemed to undermine the traditional hierarchical order of society. Others thought merchants were worldly and materialistic because they did no work of their own but rather profited from others' labor by buying and selling goods. Contrary to this opinion, guilds spread their wealth by giving alms to the poor and building churches to visibly demonstrate their members’ collective piety.<br>  <br>  The choices made by women in the patriarchal society of High Medieval Europe illustrate the new and increased variety of social classes. Women's roles usually were defined in relation to men, with marriage and childbearing as women’s main social and political functions. Nevertheless, women were active and influential throughout society. Royal and aristocratic women wielded authority at court and managed complex households, as Blanche of Castile did when she reigned as France's regent for her son, King Louis IX. Townswomen operated brewing and weaving businesses and even briefly formed their own guilds. Peasant women engaged in intensive manual labor, producing food and sustaining their households. Some women left such circumstances to become household servants in the manor or in towns, where their rights were minimal. Religious women chose to exchange the material life of marriage and family for a spiritual and intellectual life in a cloister. While women could not become priests, they did influence society as visionaries, spiritual advisors, and writers. One such influential woman was Abbess Hildegard of Bingen, Germany (1098 to 1179) who frequently spoke out on the religious, political, and social issues of her day.
wipJ9OE7aa	I think that if you live 20-30 minutes away from campus and you are in your junior year that you should just continue to commute, I don't think that it's worth the money if you are going to be using student loan funds to cover the dorm tuition. Living on campus is nice and convenient but it's not worth spending money and going into debt for. In the end I have $40,000 worth of school debt and a good portion of it came from living on campus in a dorm.

I would then have three body paragraphs on political, economic, and social similarities.|`|zcGLGPGsaa	Well I dunno what you're writing about the story.<br>  but as a thesis statement, make sure you put the title and the author in there.

Therefore:<br>  <br>  perimiter = 4 x length<br>  <br>  If we substitute this into the above...<br>  <br>  Length squared = (4 x length) + 5<br>  <br>  Moving everything to one side of the equation...<br>  <br>  Length^2 - 4xlength - 5 = 0<br>  <br>  Factorise the quadratic:<br>  <br>  (length +1)(length - 5) = 0<br>  <br>  Therefore the possible answers are length = -1 or length = 5.<br>  <br>  Because measurements of perimiter and area must be positive, we discard the negative answer.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the length of the side is 5.|`|iJyaX4nWaa	by defintion a square has sides that are all the same. So you have four sides to the square which are all the same. To find the perimiter you would add all 4 sides. to find area it is the base (a side) x height (a side). the answer is 5.

YUcl70rbaa	Atticus-  He, as both a lawyer and a human being, stands up for his democratic beliefs and encourages his children to stand up for their own, though they may stand alone.Thanks to Atticus's wisdom, Scout learns that though humanity has a great capacity for evil, it also has a great capacity for good, and that the evil can often be mitigated if one approaches others with an outlook of sympathy and understanding. Scout's development into a person capable of assuming that outlook marks the culmination of the novel and indicates that, whatever evil she encounters, she will retain her conscience without becoming cynical or jaded. <br>  <br>  Jeremy Atticus “Jem” Finch- teaches her to be strong and to stand up for herself.

smV6u3aeaa	Pride is the feeling of deep satisfaction that comes from one's own achievements or the achievements of others, or from qualities that one possesses that are widely admired. That is, I can feel proud of what I can do, my achievement. I can feel proud of what others I am close do do, like my spouse or child. I can feel proud of qualities I possess, like my long hair, or friendly nature or sense of compassion. <br>  <br>  Your teacher wants you to explain why or how that feeling of pride can be valuable.  In what way or ways would feeling pride help a person? Is it a good quality to have? Why? What would a person without pride be like? How would that lack of pride have a negative affect on that person?<br>  <br>  I would start with a good definition of  pride (don't forget to cite your source), and then explain why it may be a valuable in life. <br>  <br>  Pride can be an excessively high opinion of oneself, but I don't think this should be your focus, as I can't see how it would have value!

6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	Maybe your definition of "below average" just means beneath your standards, when someone else might look at your scores and think they're amazing.  Or maybe you're taking so many practice tests right before the exam that they're making you nervous, so you're not doing as well.  Or, some people who get really well in school do horribly on standardized tests (that was me in 3rd grade...)  That's why colleges look at your GPA more than they do your ACT or SAT score: your ACT and SAT score reflects how you did in one three-hour sitting; your GPA reflects your cumulative effort for four years.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, you should just relax and try your best tomorrow.  Don't freak out, and don't take any more practice tests, because they won't do you any good now.  <br>  <br>  You should take your time and try to get as many right as you can rather than just rush through and try to put down an answer for everything, but don't spend 10 minutes on one question.  Since there's no penalty for random guessing, if you're down to one minute and you still have blank questions, you might want to start filling in random answers.  Be sure to fill in the SAME random answer, though (for example, if you decide to randomly mark A for question 38, mark A for the other questions you didn't get to, too).  That'll increase your chances of getting SOMETHING right.|`|lCfgqr1Waa	i think ur nervous<br>  take it easy and calm down<br>  just look at it as a homework assignment

smV6u3aeaa	Synecdoche is figure of speech in which a part of something is used to represent the whole. When a poet uses this part rather than the whole, it puts emphasis on that part. The part mentioned gains importance and therefore gains the readers focus in the writing.|`|wFVsoAGGaa	Apart from the artistic image that such writing style conveys, it also can help with a chosen rhyme pattern.

x6easjsvaa	Yes, depending on the college.  You probably won't get into Yale, but you should be able to get into a public university, at the very least.  People have all sorts of life circumstances and reasons for not getting a diploma.  I'd suggest contacting the admissions office of the university that you'd like to attend and see what they say.  For what it's worth, I dropped out of school, got my GED, went to college, then went to law school, and now I'm a lawyer.  When I applied for law school, I had to disclose that I have a GED, rather than a diploma.  The law school let me in with almost a full-ride scholarship (I had excellent grades in college).  Not trying to boast, just wanted you to see that you shouldn't let being a dropout stop you from moving forward with your education.  Good luck to you!
I5bS57jmaa	I go to an all-girls school in NYC and I think that it's really good. People claim that single-sex classes are better than mixed classes. In single-sex classes, both boys and girls can feel more comfortable when they're around people of the same gender. They will be less distracted by people of the opposite sex and will probably be more able to concentrate during class. For example, girls wouldn't have to wake up hours before school started or waste their time in between classes, just to put on an amazing outfit or makeup Also, people who attend single-sex schools are more likely to try more different and new activities and extracurriculars, especially boys. Boys have a reputation of being athletic and manly. However, in an all-boys environment, they feel comfortable around each other. Boys in all-boys schools are more likely to try out for school plays, participate in choir class, join Science Olympiad etc, because in an all-boys environment, they don't have to worry about whether the girls think that it's manly or not.

The fourth sentence Commentary Sentence 2 (CM) should go on to explain the first commentary sentence further by answering 1 of 4 choices in sentence starters: 1. This also shows that... 2. This is important because... 3. This is because... 4. This shows that... The fifth sentence is the Concluding Sentence (CS).

In fact, the Cordon Blue has a school in Atlanta.  I know that it is adventurous to be away from home, but it is great to be close enough to visit.  My son went to school about 2 hours away from me.

And when his gf dropped her laptop, I ran down to Atlanta to take it to the repair man.<br>  <br>  During the freshman orientation, there were many of the college's older students who spoke to the new parents.  They said that, other than money, their parents coming to take them off campus for a break was the most helpful thing.

V. ;<br>  Résumé / Abstract<br>  The paper considers the early period of the development of cult architecture in South Mesopotamia. The main source explored is the excavation material from Abu Shahrein and Warka compared with contemporary monuments of Central and North Mesopotamia, as well as with monuments of earlier and later periods of Mesopotamian history. Nineteen layers of Eridu demonstrate step-by-step development of the ?nuclear? area first of Ubaid, and later of Sumerian culture from the VI mill. BC on. Both in Warka and in Abu Shahrein traditions of religious architecture are to be seen not only in the continuity of basic characteristics from the earliest cult buildings up to the later temples, but also in the choice of the building site. The location in a special part of the settlement, the platform, tripartite layout, symbolic pilasters and niches decorating the walls, alters and podium on the central axe of the rooms, special equipment for burning the sacrifices and strict symmetry of the temples in Uruk are explicitly analogous to the contemporary cult buildings of later Ubaid period in Eridu. In the course of the subsequent spread of Ubaid culture these characteristic elements were accepted in central and northern parts of Mesopotamia. These very elements, remarkably, constituted the basis of architectural tradition of temple-building in later periods of ancient Mesopotamia.<br>  Revue / Journal Title<br>  Vestnik drevnej istorii   ISSN 0321-0391 <br>  Source / Source<br>  2006, no2, pp. 3-23 [21 page(s) (article)]<br>  Langue / Language<br>  Russe<br>  Editeur / Publisher<br>  Nauka, Moskva, RUSSIE, FEDERATION DE  (1937) (Revue)<br>  Mots-clés anglais / English Keywords<br>  Settlement ; Site ; Uruk ; Ubaid ; Mesopotamia ; Monument ; Excavation ; Plan ; Temple ; Architecture ; Cult ;<br>  Mots-clés fran?ais / French Keywords<br>  Eridu ; Warka ; Abu Shahrein ; Architecture religieuse ; Habitat ; Site ; Uruk ; Obeid ; Mésopotamie ; Monument ; Fouille ; Plan ; Temple ; Architecture ; Culte ;<br>  Localisation / Location<br>  INIST-CNRS, Cote INIST : 23417, 35400011563633.0010

eGXNJALIaa	No offense, but your writing skills will need a lot of work. Not only will you need them for college applications, but also throughout college in general. Don't fret though, there are a lot of different things you can do. Remember to keep past material from classes like chemistry, for example. This can help you remember everything you forgot! That, "ohhh yeah" moment. Look over some grammar worksheets, subject verb agreement and other general rules. It won't take long and will help you a lot. Last but not least, make sure you take the SAT and ACT. Even if your scores aren't too good, keep trying. Practice helps. To be accepted into decent schools shoot for a 23+. If you're wanting good money from some of those average institutions I recommend a 10% class rank and 28+ on the ACT. <br>  <br>  You said you felt like you were behind. Try scheduling a meeting with your high school counselor, teachers, or principal. Explain your feelings and see what they can do to help you. Everyone at your school is there to prepare you for the next level in your education. Good luck!|`|PHknlA1Zaa	this doesn't really help need to know you acummative grade point average G.P.A  and if you have taken ACT or SAT and those scores but really you can get in ANYWHERE it may not be a good school.

Also you should know your class rank,(where you stand out of how many people in your class,the percent for instance, i'm 98 out of 401 which makes me in the top 25 percent)|`|XKhNw221aa	you're set for a junior college, but since your math skills are not at the level they should be, university math might be a little challenging.

The difference between them is this: a visitor might view your profile five times (so, that's five hits), but only one visitor would be counted because it's the same person (from the same computer) viewing the page multiple times.. so, it it would be recorded as one visitor and five hits.

2UvVIRjNaa	I wish a person knowledgeable in dramatic arts would respond to your question. Hopefully, you are familiar with the education requirements and time restraints of acting.<br>  <br>  In most states, In order to sit for the CPA exam, you need 150 semester hours. Check the url below to determine your state requirements and be sure to read the degree plan for accounting at your school.<br>  <br>  Accounting, like acting requires a lot of memorization and practice. Accounting is task oriented and acting is the opposite. This is a reason why I think that while it may be difficult, taking courses you really and truly like that interest you is important. An error some accounting students quite understandably make is to not use their electives in a completely different area of study. <br>  <br>  It is easy to isolate and become one-track minded by the time the more stressful upper division classes roll around. In my view, taking a few acting course will prevent this happening to you. I think it may be possible to multi-task between acting and accounting courses, however I am uncertain about doing the same for two careers.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider is that you do not necessarily have to remain in public accounting when you obtain your CPA. There are a lot of niches out there and it's possible to apply your accounting skills in a field you like and are familiar - such as acting or any aspect of the performance arts. Good luck.

ntm91alQaa	I am not in any of these field's so I have no first hand experience to offer but I have been researching most of these and think I can help. Being a biology teacher is in great demand but you have to have a true love for teaching and science. Teachers do not have weekends off, they have to do lesson plans for the following week, they have to work in the summer and there pay is low. Microbiologist would take to much schooling unless you have always wanted to do this. Nurses are in demand as well but from what I have heard from nurses is that it an impossible job. You have a huge case load, short staffed, and work in unsafe conditions. Nursing from those I have talked to has to be in your blood otherwise you will come to hate the job. Speech language pathologist I think have it the easiest out of all the occupations you listed. They are in demand, they make good money, low stress, you can work in different settings(schools, hospitals, home health, private practice). But in order to become a SLP you need a master's degree, which could take 4-6 years depending on how hard you work and course load.|`|4yNhkOBzaa	Nobody can answer that for you.

MjKnYm1baa	Smelling, tasting and breathing all start in the nose. The size, location, mucous lining and tiny hairs (cilia) inside help prevent foreign objects to enter and to trap large air impurities before being drawn further into the respiratory system. <br>  The nose is the first and last organ that air passes through. The nose serves some very most important functions. As part of the conducting zone, it cleans the air of dust and other impurities, warms the air if it is too cool, and moistens the air if it is dry. Though not related to respiration, your nose also helps you to speak, and is the organ that gives you the power to smell.<br>  <br>  After passing through the external nares (nostrils), it passes through the nasal cavities. Your nasal septum separates the two nasal cavities. Immediately after passing through the nostrils into the nasal cavities, the air begins to be purified, humidified and warmed. The skin of the vestibule, the part of the nasal cavities behind the nostrils, has sebaceous and sweat glands and hair follicles, which catch the dirt or other impurities that may be in the air. The hair growing out of the follicles are called vibrissae.<br>  <br>  The olfactory mucosa is what detects scents that you inhale. The serous glands excrete enough lysozyme, an enzyme that destroys bacteria, to keep the air you breathe mostly pure. That is about a quart a day. It will kill the bacteria that is caught by the vibrissae.<br>  <br>  I found this info oon google we just learned about it last term but i forget most of the stuff because it was so boring to learn about.

The ribosomes only bind to the ER once it begins to synthesize a protein destined for sorting.[4] The free ribosome begins synthesizing a protein until a cytosolic signal recognition particle recognizes the pre-piece of 5-15 hydrophobic amino acids preceded by a positively charged amino acid. This allows the complex to loop the sequence through the hydrophobic RER membrane. The pre-piece is then cleaved off within the lumen of the RER.<br>  <br>  The membrane of the RER is continuous with the outer layer of the nuclear envelope. Although there is no continuous membrane between the RER and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments.[5] Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the golgi and COPI marks them to be brought back to the RER. The RER works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. A second method of transport out of the ER are areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the ER and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.[6][7]<br>  <br>  The RER is key in multiple functions:<br>  <br>  lysosomal enzymes with a mannose-6-phosphate marker added in the cis-Golgi network <br>  Secreted proteins, either secreted constitutively with no tag, or regulated secretion involving clathrin and paired basic amino acids in the signal peptide. <br>  integral membrane proteins that stay imbedded in the membrane as vesicles exit and bind to new membranes. Rab proteins are key in targeting the membrane, SNAP and SNARE proteins are key in the fusion event. <br>  initial glycosylation as assembly continues. This is either N-linked or O-linked (O-linked may likely occur in the golgi). <br>  N-linked glycosylation: if the protein is properly folded, glycosyltransferase recognizes the AA sequence NXS or NXT (with the S/T residue phosphorylated) and adds a 14 sugar backbone (2 N-acetylglucosamine, 9 branching mannose, and 3 glucose at the end) to the side chain nitrogen of Asn.|`|USsjb7YLaa	its like a highway for things to come out of the nucleous and ribosomes are housed in there and they make proteins theres also ribosomes in cytoplasm dont forget|`|8HamUmaOaa	The ER is responsible for protein|`|A1ZRK2qNaa	it attaches ribo-nuecleotides on its surface and helps in protien synthesis...t is a huge network kind of a substance inside a cell, so it helps in transportation of substances from nucleas to other organelles|`|EZSYtYwZaa	I'm not very good at science but maybe you should look in your text book it might have some info. <br>  <br>  P.S.

89ab1554abb8b48fcd9577d80bac730eaa	Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater caused by human activities, which can be harmful to organisms and plants which live in these water bodies.Although natural phenomena such as volcanoes, algae blooms, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water, water is typically referred to as polluted when it impaired by anthropogenic contaminants and either does not support a human use (like serving as drinking water) or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its constituent biotic communities. Water pollution has many causes and characteristics. The primary sources of water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their point of origin. Point-source pollution refers to contaminants that enter a waterway through a discrete "point source". Examples of this category include discharges from a wastewater treatment plant, outfalls from a factory, leaking underground tanks, etc. The second primary category, non-point source pollution, refers to contamination that, as its name suggests, does not originate from a single discrete source. Non-point source pollution is often a cumulative affect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. Nutrient runoff in stormwater from sheet flow over an agricultural field, or metals and hydrocarbons from an area with high impervious surfaces and vehicular traffic are examples of non-point source pollution. The primary focus of legislation and efforts to curb water pollution for the past several decades was first aimed at point sources. As point sources have been effectively regulated, greater attention has come to be placed on non-point source contributions, especially in rapidly urbanizing/suburbanizing or developing areas.<br>  <br>  The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals, pathogens, and physical or sensory changes. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring (iron, manganese, etc) the concentration is often the key in determining what is a natural component of water, and what is a contaminant. Many of the chemical substances are toxic. Pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. Alteration of water's physical chemistry include acidity, electrical conductivity, temperature, and eutrophication. Eutrophication is the fertilisation of surface water by nutrients that were previously scarce. Water pollution is a major problem in the global context. It has been suggested that it is the leading worldwide cause of deaths and diseases, and that it accounts for thHealth impacts of water pollution <br>  <br>  It is a well-known fact that clean water is absolutely essential for healthy living. Adequate supply of fresh and clean drinking water is a basic need for all human beings on the earth, yet it has been observed that millions of people worldwide are deprived of this. <br>  <br>  Freshwater resources all over the world are threatened not only by over exploitation and poor management but also by ecological degradation. The main source of freshwater pollution can be attributed to discharge of untreated waste, dumping of industrial effluent, and run-off from agricultural fields. Industrial growth, urbanization and the increasing use of synthetic organic substances have serious and adverse impacts on freshwater bodies. It is a generally accepted fact that the developed countries suffer from problems of chemical discharge into the water sources mainly groundwater, while developing countries face problems of agricultural run-off in water sources. Polluted water like chemicals in drinking water causes problem to health and leads to water-borne diseases which can be prevented by taking measures can be taken even at the household level.<br>  <br>  <br>  Groundwater and its contamination <br>  <br>  Many areas of groundwater and surface water are now contaminated with heavy metals, POPs (persistent organic pollutants), and nutrients that have an adverse affect on health. Water-borne diseases and water-caused health problems are mostly due to inadequate and incompetent management of water resources. Safe water for all can only be assured when access, sustainability, and equity can be guaranteed. Access can be defined as the number of people who are guaranteed safe drinking water and sufficient quantities of it. There has to be an effort to sustain it, and there has to be a fair and equal distribution of water to all segments of the society. Urban areas generally have a higher coverage of safe water than the rural areas. Even within an area there is variation: areas that can pay for the services have access to safe water whereas areas that cannot pay for the services have to make do with water from hand pumps and other sources. <br>  <br>  In the urban areas water gets contaminated in many different ways, some of the most common reasons being leaky water pipe joints

Thus, the policy permits trading partners mutual gains from trade, with goods and services produced according to the law of comparative advantage. Under a free trade policy, prices are a reflection of true supply and demand, and are the sole determinant of resource allocation. Free trade differs from other forms of trade policy where the allocation of goods and services amongst trading countries are determined by artificial prices that do not reflect the true nature of supply and demand. These artificial prices are the result of protectionist trade policies, whereby governments intervene in the market through price adjustments and supply restrictions. Such government interventions generally increase the cost of goods and services to both consumers and producers. Interventions include subsidies, taxes and tariffs, non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory legislation and quotas, and even inter-government managed trade agreements such as the North American Free fist of all i would like to say good evening.......Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) (contrary to their formal titles.)--any governmental market intervention resulting in artificial prices that do not reflect the principles of supply and demand. Most states conduct trade polices that are to a lesser or greater degree protectionist.[1] One ubiquitous protectionist policy employed by states comes in the form agricultural subsidies whereby countries attempt to protect their agricultural industries from outside competition by creating artificial low prices for their agricultural goods.[2]that pretty much somes it all up.......seeya|`|WjGKwXe9aa	A person who advocates free trade.

"Less" is better to use with uncountable nouns like "water," "spaghetti," or "anger."<br>  <br>  Note that the distinction has less to do with concrete vs. abstract, and more to do with countability.  "Nationality" is a countable abstract noun, but "anger" is an uncountable abstract.  They would be handled differently.<br>  <br>  However, in casual speech, "less" is often used in either case.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	That varies from one school's system to another.  At my last school, the student's date of birth was available (I remember checking it for graduate groups to gauge the likelihood that my students would have prior work experience, for example).  Then one day the system went to a new version and that particular piece of information disappeared, at least from things I was able to access.  At my current school I don't have that information at all.<br>  <br>  When you say you seem really young, do you mean 10, or 17?  I can't imagine giving a student any different treatment based on his/her age, unless that age is truly unusual.  I've had students who were 15 or 16, and it wouldn't make any difference to me.  I might be a little more protective if the student were 10 or 12.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Sure, and it's not an invasion of your human rights etc. If they have questions or suspicions they have a right to check your records. I have had times during which I questioned the appropriateness of students in my class on age grounds. However, being in a private school the parent often held the final say, whether or not it was going to prove detrimental to the child's development in the long term. (Pushy parent syndrome I'm afraid).|`|563a202d21b6ef1f2e6be958ccf13824aa	Teachers can easily find out your age.<br>  <br>  They're in your records.<br>  <br>  I've never been particularly curious.

wMxJDXcRaa	Judges live in the community. There is no empirical evidence that, as a group, their general experience of life is narrower than that of most other occupational groups. People who administer criminal justice probably see conduct that most members of the community never imagine. A Family Court judge would have a regular view of domestic relations that would throw many people into despair. When you consider the parade of life that passes before a suburban or rural magistrate, it is difficult to understand why the judiciary, as a class, might be regarded as isolated from reality. It is therefore strongly advisable to elect the right people, through their life experiences.|`|Ym7H3x49aa	Just say that the president shouldn't be the only person to appoint the judiciary because what if they work together and the checks and balances won't be so balanced! Congress would lose power because the judges could be biased in the president's favor.
3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	If you are under 21, you're screwed.  I had the same problem.  Even though I was independent at 18, you can't legally be considered independent until you are 21 - they assume your parents will help you regardless of if they actually will.  After 21, you can file without your parents income.  So no, there is really nothing you can do about it.|`|TkbqAKcOaa	That doesn't really sound right. I think the best idea would be to confirm what's up by going to the financial aid office and asking someone who works there.|`|XKhNw221aa	dead in the water. FASFA always assumes that your parents will take 20% and put it towards all childrens education.|`|c46140f0ed1bdf47a7f332d7d6ea3dc0aa	No. There is nowhere on the FAFSA that will ask you whether your parents actually intend to provide any financial support to you. You are considered dependent unless one of the following applies to you (for the 09-10 academic year):<br>  <br>  You were born before 1986<br>  You are married<br>  You have children that receive more than half of their support from you<br>  You are working on a master's/doctorate program<br>  You are an orphan/ward of the court<br>  You are/were legally emancipated<br>  You are/were in legal guardianship of someone other than your parent<br>  You are determined to be a "homeless, unaccompanied youth"<br>  You are a veteran or currently on active duty<br>  <br>  If none of those applies, then you must use your parent information on the FAFSA. The theory is that it is your parents, first and foremost, that have the primary responsibility for funding your higher education, NOT other taxpayers. If you think of it that way, it makes sense. Unfortunately, the government cannot force your parent to actually contribute toward your education. And it is disappointing that they are choosing not to.

AA10297143	First, any opinion is just that, an opinion of what someone thinks, even if it doesn't appear to be serious.  With that said, I offer the following:<br>  <br>  The GED is a feel good program to make people who can't or won't finish traditional high school, and if they can pass a test then they can get a certification called a GED. This is only a feel good program and not really worth much else, but it can be used to get you into the military or into some Community Colleges. Good luck.|`|ekr6BBe3aa	You want the easier way out and that's normal. You may not need any more than a GED, but every prospective employer will see that you took the easy route and wonder about your work ethics. Reading, or deciphering your question shows that you are lazy and or used to texting, or have very poor grammar. Your grammar will not improve much with the limited knowledge that is needed to pass the GED. If it's at all possible to get the diploma, get it.|`|ebHcrGdpaa	It sounds like you want to make a great future for yourself but you honestly hate school.  I feel for ya' because I hate it too..but the sad thing is that in order to have a great future in this day and age it almost always means investing in your education.  As far as graduation goes, no matter what anyone tells you, there isnt any difference between your GED and HS diploma.  People will almost certaintly tell you that a GED isnt as good...dont listen just graduate! (this is coming from someone who has a diploma and has two parents who teach HS)  Also...dont just choose CNA because its easy, choose something you love because you will do better in the program if you actually like what you are doing.  Look into technical schools..they are short programs and they lead directly to a job.  And since you havent graduated yet, talk to you HS counselor about any Running Start programs they might have.  Basically (at least in my state) these are programs where you can attend college classes while still in high school and recieve dual credit..credit for both college and highschool...and its free all you pay for is your books.  I graduated from highschool with my associates degree...which put me 2 years ahead of everyone else.  Check with your local school district about other programs available, like online course for kids who are struggling.  Dont give up, and dont worry about anyone elses problems right now.  Finish school and take care of yourself so you can have a good life and are able to be happy! Good luck!|`|mNr3SIUEaa	The practical answer is to get the GED. It is equivalent to HSD, and when applying to jobs, you simply state on the resume something like:<br>  <br>  Education:<br>  G.E.D. (Homeschooled)<br>  <br>  or some such. Employers may question you about it, but don't tell them what you just said here. Just say that you were homeschooled, and got your GED. That should satisfy anyone who asks.
rDUTaVuuaa	As the novel progresses, Golding shows how different people feel the influences of the instincts of civilization and savagery to different degrees. Piggy, for instance, has no savage feelings, while Roger seems barely capable of comprehending the rules of civilization. Generally, however, Golding implies that the instinct of savagery is far more primal and fundamental to the human psyche than the instinct of civilization. Golding sees moral behavior, in many cases, as something that civilization forces upon the individual rather than a natural expression of human individuality. When left to their own devices, Golding implies, people naturally revert to cruelty, savagery, and barbarism. This idea of innate human evil is central to Lord of the Flies, and finds expression in several important symbols, most notably the beast and the sow's head on the stake. Among all the characters, only Simon seems to possess anything like a natural, innate goodness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically sow's head means that they've reached savagery for dominance over power.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	The hog appears to simon in a dream and speaks to him. <br>  <br>  "Fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill! Oh, You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you?"<br>  <br>  The novel gets it's name from the hog's head<br>  <br>  The  hog's head, blackened by the mass of flies that covers it's head, represents the blackness within the soul of mankind. Meaning, the evil that is inherent in man. This evil heart is represented by the filthy fly covered head of one of the filthiest beasts on earth.<br>  <br>   I suppose it also represents the savage nature of man. When man is removed from civilized society, who basically trained him to act civilized, he will go back to his natural state and will act upon his evil intentions and treat his fellow man with cruelty. <br>  <br>  This is why Golding uses children to illustrate his ideas. Children are less affected by society's rules, because children have had less time to be trained and forced by society to act civilized.<br>  <br>   If man were good by nature, then children, when left alone to make their own rules and decisions would be kind and fair to each other. They would revert to a naturally kind and fair state of mind.  But because man is a savage by nature, even so called innocent children will be cruel and mean to each other, when they are  separated from laws and rules.|`|XKhNw221aa	<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/themes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/them...</a>|`|0LLekEuXaa	the future i think<br>  or either death and desperation<br>  <br>  <br>  its been 4 years....|`|4be6c5b4c2a18bd2a8a48c2dff0419ceaa	i don't really remember but i think it represents the devil a.k.a.

urUp4bZiaa	It sounds like you have answered your own question.. take the free period. You have plenty of time while you are in college to take college courses, your senior year of highschool doesn't need to be overloaded with classes that you aren't interested in. AP Biology is really hard, I took it my senior year and it took up atleast 2-3 hours a night. It will only take away time from your other classes and if you aren't interested in it you probably won't do as well. It's better to get a good grade in the classes you want to take than suffer through a class you dislike. Try to enjoy your senior year and make some memories instead of worrying about taking so many AP classes, with your parents on your side and such an impressive academic background you'll definitely get into college with or without AP Biology.

When about 15,000 volts of electricity are applied to the glass tube, an electric discharge occurs, causing the tube to glow a redish-orange color.

ihJw9xTwaa	I have a best friend name  julianne I LOVE that name I think the nicknames should be - yen, anne, julia, lianne :) <br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|weDd8uuDaa	I like Violette. or Viola. and then the nickname could be Vi. Lena is nice, Rafaela, Sola. ya. lol I could go on forever. Maybe you should try and find a name with a specific meaning - like a word that reflects your character. Babynames.com is usually pretty good for finding names.|`|Eh3m7xCeaa	i really like the name violette, i think it sounds very girly and cute!|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Julianne - nickname : Annie|`|igLGjvXjaa	i like the name Lucy. I also like the names Elise, Emily, and Natily...sorry that's how I like to spell it...Natalie
rHqe7oMoaa	*Choose an ethical issue (ie. abortion, stem cell research, alcohol etc...)<br>  *research it, reading articles both for and against<br>  *Describe the issue, and how the media contributes to how the public debates and perceives said issue. ie. do they write positive articles? negative? <br>  *Are we privy to all the facts regarding issue?<br>  *How are concerns for the privacy of others and other issues changing how the media is allowed to present the issue? What effect does the Internet (sites listed) have on the issue?|`|ig0miCndaa	Select an idea that is related to today's society.  It has to be an issue that hs ethical concerns.  that means it has no absolute right or wrong answer, but the opinion of people can be debated (such as stem cell Research, or abortion) Is the solution or discussion of this issue something people are willing to discuss publicly, or is it something people would rather keep hidden?  Is the solution to this issue and discussions surrounding it  made more complex or less complex by having it discussed in all the different forms of mass media?|`|wGQvgeXDaa	How about a research paper on "how the global media portray Islam"?|`|uu4Tr99naa	Break down each of the steps. If you look at everything in parts it won't seem as overwhelming and will be easier to understand.<br>  <br>  1. find a subject that interests you. Do you like sports, economy, the environment? Maybe teen fashion and media influences?<br>  <br>  2. Research it and use many kinds of resources. Remember to keep track of your sources so you can write a bibliography if needed.<br>  <br>  3. Explain your topic. Would it be easier to understand if there weren't so many media forms i.e. internet you tube news papers? What would it be like if your info was coming from one source? Include privacy and freedom of info.|`|6du6kZjmaa	Think of a controversial issue in today's world, such as Obama's plan for economy as an example. Find articles that talk positives and negatives about it then also find how it goes out into Mass media such as political cartoons, Saturday Night live skits. Talk about how that mass media attention gives more attention to the problem itself and does it help or make it worse.
eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	You find it impossible to take any kind of order even if the order is a simple "Please kiss me" This inability to provide your share of the give and take in a relationship makes it pretty one-sided. And thus less satisfying.|`|5c6671e8f478958f34681c2f7e863dc2aa	It means you have an automatic will to resist authority and it may impede your love life (although, personally, I don't think "authority" and "love life" belong in the same sentence...true love holds no "authority").|`|0EB2ZR0Gaa	I would say that it means in order to have a satisfying love life you need to submit to the authority of your partner.    (Wow!  I do so disagree!)|`|9syEUfnqaa	oh wow. it sounds like it means you need to relax more so your love life can be more satisfying.
C4WlEbIOaa	The fact that you are so deeply involved within the field of acting/drama is a plus for you already.  However, I can tell you that your GPA should be well above a 4.0 and your SAT score should be as close as possible to a 2400. Also, you will have to take at least 3 SAT II, and you should come as close as possible to an 800 for each of those.  You probably want to take your Subject Tests in English, History and another subject of your choice.  You should take AP Drama/Art classes if they are offered at your school, with as many AP and Honors as possible.  DO NOT LET YOUR GRADES SLIP NEXT YEAR.  You should start working on your application this summer and try and submit it as soon as possible so you are not rushing at the last moment.  Your recommendations should be excellent, and so should be your personal statement.  Visit the school if you can this summer.  And, they require interviews, so interview and make it count!  Save as much money as possible and get as many scholarships as possible and do not rely on too much financial aid, especially in these economic times.  That could be a major reason of rejection, especially if acceptance rates are cut back.<br>  Remember, Brown is an ivy league and they reject many valedictorians each year despite their excellent grades and extracurricular activities. They only accept 14% of those who apply-- only 1,548 people may enroll for their freshman class.<br>  <br>  You should look into BU, Boston College, NYU, University of Chicago as well. They all have GREAT fine arts programs.  Especially NYU.|`|SUuBUtCDaa	why don't you try and go to a school like Julliard who focuses mostly all on performing arts and things like that? why brown? the charity fund will definitely add depth to your application.|`|jN8duTx2aa	As and Bs isn't really Brown level, most Brown applicants have a near perfect GPA.<br>  <br>  There is a slim chance that serious acting work could get you in, but why Brown?  Places like NYU and UCLA are much better acting schools for undergrads and more in your GPA range.|`|VIvNa9pMaa	Sounds like your grades are not good enough for Brown.  You might have a chance at Holy Cross which has a renown Theatre Dept.  Holy Cross  Last year he department of theatre at the College of the Holy Cross was awarded the New England Theatre Conference’s (NETC) Moss Hart Award for best college play.

lzEuuseJaa	The tuition is $58,300 and there is a mandatory $4350 Campus Enhancement Fund. 70% is due July 1st (the summer before school starts), the balance on November 15. <br>  <br>  They give very little financial aid, at the most 10% of tuition. And they will expect your parents to donate generously, $10,000 a year would be a small donation. There will be other things to donate to, like to the theatre-building campaign.<br>  <br>  You can't just pay and get in, unless you can donate about $50,000 or more on top of tuition, etc. You need to take an entrance exam scores and have good grades for at least the last 3 years. This school is very much about the size of donation as to who gets admitted.<br>  <br>  I am guessing you will be in 9th grade next year. In that case, you'd need 4 years worth of tuition and donations, etc. So approx $300,000. It would be very hard to fundraise that much money, because it would not be tax deductible.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0T769lIuaa	oh awesome i would like to go to a german boarding school. i live in texas too and its prettyyy far lol! nice idea i hope you get their.

MoaIQPvCaa	Yes, you can. If you want to go through a virtual school or homeschool academy, you will need to find one that does year-round enrollment. I know that Charity Christian Academy does year-round enrollment.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	You can home school anytime during the school year. You can do online school, or do it by textbook curriculum.|`|pMxaRnMHaa	I'm homeschooled. I am in a virtual academy called OHVA. It's free, and they send you a computer. You should try looking for a virtual academy for your state. It would be very helpful in your situation.|`|DDBBXu2xaa	Of course! Look up the American school!!! They will get you started! :] They are great too! :] I go to a virtual school called TXVA! but my brother uses American school..and he LOVES it! :] you can join any time!|`|6fVzzNhiaa	Yes.  You can start homeschooling any time, but some states have filing timeframes.  You or your mom would need to check the laws of your state to see if you have to file-before-starting, or if official withdrawal from school is sufficient.<br>  <br>  Before you choose a program, be aware that different laws apply to the different choices of at-home schooling.  "Attendance" would be an area in which the state-funded virtual school might require you to log in/be online at specific times or risk being labeled truant, whereas people who are homeschooling would be free to set their own schedules.  Also, online schools that conduct live classes would also have the requirement that you be online at certain times, although that would be for instructional purposes and not necessarily for truancy avoidance.<br>  <br>  Each choice carries it's own mix of risks/requirements and benefits.<br>  <br>  I suppose your steps would be:<br>  1) See if your state has filing restrictions. <br>  2) Consider how much flexibility you'll need given your grandmother's medical condition, or how much in-place lesson planning would be helpful  (would you prefer to be free to arrange your own schedule, or would having an arranged schedule & required materials be one less chore to do).<br>  3) Consider educating yourself about your grandmother's condition and her care needs, so that you can take better care of her, and so you can use that time in tracking your education hours if you choose to homeschool rather than use an established program (science or health).  I say this seriously rather than with an eye to being unpaid help.<br>  4) Research your choices:  <br>  -- homeschool<br>  -- distance learning/correspondence course<br>  -- virtual school<br>  <br>  I hope your grandmother regains as much of her health as is possible.<br>  Good luck.

bCi8BCBBaa	That would depend on several things.  I know that kids who receive transportation to special education classes can be picked up and dropped off at sites other than their homes when their parents arrange it with the school district.  Usually the district limits the pick up and drop off to sites within the district boundaries. <br>  <br>  If there is regular school bus service within your district, if the bus stops near your mom's restaurant you may be able to arrange to get on/off there.  Contact the busing department.|`|LsAArkUyaa	It really depends on the policies in your school district, but most of the time it is possible. For several yrs my niece got off the school bus at my sisters office. The only problem would be if the restaurant is located in an area where the bus service doesn't run, either because no one lives in the area, or because it is out of your school's district.|`|pMxaRnMHaa	You need to call your school, and ask them. See if there is anyway that they could pick  you up if you are on a route. If not you could always try the public transit buses:)|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	Usually buses only pick up kids at designated bus stops.

MaedaeJPaa	Not sure where you are or what your situation is, but I know many people who have not gotten their student loans until 3 months in to the semester. My best advice, make sure that all of the information on your application is ABSOLUTELY correct because they will send back the form to as many times as necessary for silly little things, which slows up the process for a couple of weeks each time. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Also, a good place to check is...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.BestFinancialAid.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.BestFinancialAid.info/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|l56PMPFkaa	Usually it takes about 3-4 weeks, at least that's about how long till my school received it. It does also depend on if all the information on the application is correct and they don't ask for more, that delays the process.|`|eQrJW9GMaa	colleges.mywebcommunity.org - try this site. It has info about different US scholarships for college students and their grades requirements.
5S0o2jBWaa	That's easy.<br>  <br>  If it's too difficult for you to do,  then draw it out on a piece of paper, but anyways, here's how you do it.<br>  <br>  1. Length of garden is X+8<br>  2. Sidewalk width=4<br>  3. 320/4=80<br>  4. 80=Inside Perimeter<br>  5. 2(X)+2(X+8)=80 which is also X+X+X+X+16=80<br>  6. Subtract 16 from both sides so 4X=64<br>  7. Divide by 4 so X=16<br>  8. Width of Garden=16, and length=24<br>  9. Check.  16+16+24+24=80, Perfect!<br>  <br>  (I don't know why tom4bucs is multiplying the length and width by 4, since that applies only to the sidewalk.  I also don't know where the lengths went on his answer, so you may want to compare our answers and decide for yourself)|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	half the fun of a word problem is getting them into the numbers<br>  so let's have fun<br>  <br>  garden w and L = w + 8<br>  <br>  now the sidewalk is 2w's and 2L + the sidewalk<br>  so that each Length also has 8 feet of sidewalk (both sides)<br>  so 2W(4) + 2(L + 8)(4) = 320<br>  8W + 2(W+8 +8)(4) = 320<br>  8W + (2W + 32)4 = 320<br>  8W + 8W + 128 = 320<br>  16W = 192<br>  w = 12<br>  therefore L = 20<br>  <br>  all the best|`|8JDxBlcVaa	ha im doing these same question right now. there horrible.
HtdKdSbWaa	I'm not sure I understand your numbers, BUT<br>  <br>  slope = rise/run<br>  <br>  So, (assuming you're saying that slope is 10 and rise is 2):<br>  <br>  10 = 2/run<br>  Cross-multiply: (10)(run) = 2<br>  Divide both sides by 10: run = 2/10<br>  run = 1/5|`|AA11518844	ok, what? <br>  <br>  take the amount it has risen, the height of the ramp. <br>  <br>  now take the number of feet long it is. <br>  <br>  now, height/length = slope<br>  <br>  your question is awkwardly worded and i can't give you any more information based on what you asked.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	You will have two issues to overcome (my first teaching job was in Regina).  First of all, you would need to have permission to work in Canada, which has become increasingly difficult for Americans over time.  Your employer would basically have to prove that there were no Canadians eligible for the job in order to be able to hire you.  Secondly, no, just as you couldn't teach in most other U.S. states with a Florida teaching certificate, you can't teach in Canada without getting re-certified there.  That shouldn't be too much of a barrier, but it isn't possible to teach there without it.|`|azO0V5kTaa	Hi Amanda -  I will answer both your questions -  Unfortunately,  in Canada we have 10 provinces and 3 territories.  Each and everyone has its own Teachers' licensing organization/federation.  You would have to submit your qualifications directly to them and they would let you know  if you can,  cannot or what you would need to do to be able to do so.  So,  whichever province you choose,  I'm assuming in this case that it's Saskatchewan,  here is the teacher's federation website   <a href="http://www.stf.sk.ca/." rel="nofollow">http://www.stf.sk.ca/.</a>  From British Columbia I wish you good luck.
WvqRJow1aa	Here sunshine represents happiness. This phrase indicates that to have a wholesome life, we need not only the happy times but also times of pain and privation which, like rain, help us to grow and learn.<br>  Life would be a desert if we were only happy because we would then not appreciate it, not know what it really is to be happy. Only struggle can teach us to respect the good things of life. Just as rain is needed for barren lands to sprout vegetation.|`|213df96cd601a86457f2e97e4a811bb8aa	We may want only good things in life, but we have to accept the bad things too. Happiness can only be fully appreciated by one who has known sadness too. Sunshine alone makes a desert; rain brings in the flowers. So a few tears amidst our smiles can be of no harm...|`|9c2523b18947871def2ed96a1c5be254aa	i dunno sunshine can mean happiness. and desert means a tasty treat...so if you keep your woman happy she will give you treats...thats what i tell my hubby
j41BEfMAaa	My guess of meaning:<br>  You cant change the way things are, but you can change your view of the way you can look at things.  Ex: Either positevaly or negativaly.|`|wrrKmlVuaa	im going to take a guess .<br>  things dont change techinically but if you change your way of looking at things  you will see things differently ex: there is so many ways of looking at one situation that situation will never change but  you can look at it positive or negative....its how you look at things|`|ReHJAUfRaa	agree w/ first answer.<br>  for example: i always hated going to school like dreaded it. i would find ways to stay home or skip just b/c i didnt want to go soooo bad. but one day i gave it thought: i HAVE to finish school. no matter what i try school is still going to be going on tomorrow, or next year. so instead of depressing myself about it, i decided that while i was there, since i have to, im going to make the absolute best of it. there's no getting out of it so why not just suck it up and try to enjoy it? <br>  now i actually do enjoy it. i picked up interesting classes, branched out got new friends, i even come early now just to hang out there. allb/c my mind set changed, school didnt.

Z0odTlyQaa	Yes I actually just read a news article about some women being charged with prostitution for performing a sexual act while someone watched (an undercover cop, doesn't it seem like they shouldn't have let them go through with it and busted them right away?

6c4eacbc33273c871bc7185d6f301bc7aa	You should never mix red with any other clothes. Always wash red clothes separate. Then seperate by dark colors and light colors. Dark colors such as blues and blacks can be washed together. All other colors are fine to be washed together. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Also..do not mix towels with clothes, the lint from towels will get stuck on your clothes. Not fun! =)

cAaNsGguaa	50 credits is a lot to have when you try and transfer. Most schools have a residency requirement of 60 credits to graduate from their institution, so if you're planning on a 4-year graduation, you need to be careful to not have more than 60 credits when you apply as a transfer student. <br>  <br>  In my experience, the GPAs of transfer students need to be higher than the GPAs of freshmen applicants. As a bare minimum I would guess about a 3.0, but that's just a guess and I know nothing about U of I. <br>  <br>  Try princetonreview.com to see the average GPA of incoming freshmen. That should give you some idea of their standards.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Most universitys say you need a minimum GPA of 2.00 to transfer- but thats pretty low.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Sorry, I know it's hard to hear, but a GPA below 3.0 is not going to get you a congressional nomination, say nothing of actually getting into the academy.  It's cruel, but GPA is only one of two ways they can objectively assess candidates (the other being SATs).   Since you're already well aware of this, it's just time to accept that fact and move onwards.  Your GPA is state school material so look into that.  In your case you can think about ROTC although Navy ROTC programs are harder to find.  You could also do OCS after graduating from a 4 year, though OCS programs have become extremely selective.  But the point is you would have a chance with that, since a college record is all they will care to look at.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Noobnub, you can earn a commission in four ways: attending the academy; doing a ROTC program; Officers Candidate School (OCS); and direct commission.  Naval ROTC programs are not as common as Army/Air force ones but they do exist -- ROTC programs are just classes you take while in college, but if you do the whole program you will end up with a commission (and commitment) on the day of your graduation.  OCS as I mentioned has become competitive, but you basically "sign up", go to the equivalent of officers boot camp, and then do your training.  Direct commission is for people with highly specialized degrees/skills, such as physicians, nurses.

Even though my school is smaller than yours there is still a lot of cat fights (especially since it's an all girls school) and a lot of people are too judgmental. <br>  <br>  I think every school is like that though. There will always be people like that. Just ignore them and make friends with people that don't judge you. <br>  <br>  Fights are inevitable, even with closest of friends, fights break out. Just, try to bare it and try to fix the problem that started it. If it's a fight with one of those people that judge you then just ignore them and kick their butt in sport. <br>  <br>  Hope your new school is better than the one your at now!

In other cases where quotation marks are used, the location of the period varies; sometime it's inside the quotes, sometimes outside.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	A PhD is an education, not specific job training (like you would get certification for).  It's a research degree, which means you would be capable of doing original work and contributing to your field.  You could teach at the university level.  Many top schools have PhD programs - ask your academic adviser about good programs you might be able to get into.  <br>  <br>  The PhD dissertation doesn't have a set length - it's about the content.  If you can write something useful and publishable in 50 pages, you're done.  You can go on for 300 pages and still not accomplish anything.  The topic is up to you and your adviser, but should contribute something new to the field and be do-able in a couple of years of work on your part.  It's evaluated based on accuracy and completeness - it's usually a pass/fail thing, not an actual grade.

gb9REJN4aa	This is an imperfect English sentence for several reasons. However, a native English speaker would still be able to understand that it means that they had not been around second-hand smokers.<br>  <br>  In fact, it is correct English to say "he had not ever smoked," which means the same as "he had never smoked." You can also say, "he had not ever smoked or been around second-hand smokers" = "he had never smoked or been around second-hand smokers" = "he had not smoked and also he had not been around second-hand smokers." Finally, you can say "he had not ever smoked nor had he ever been around second-hand smokers," which is the same as "he had never smoked and had never been around second-hand smokers," which is also the same as "he had never smoked or ever been around second-hand smokers." Those mean the same thing. However, the last one is the least clear and the one to be avoided. Sadly, it's also the one you had to read.

The instructors are all professionals who are successful in their fields and the programs are super challenging, but they prepare you for a great job when you graduate. The cool thing is that you get a great education, but they also show you how to market yourself in the professional world.

On the other hand, instructors some times want see that the student has an understanding of the subject matter. Further, ALD is kind of exotic and complex in a way. Maybe you should refine the topic in a way that makes it interesting to you. <br>  <br>  ALD is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder a disease that attacks the central nervous system by systemically destroying its protective cover, the myelin sheath. It …........<br>  <br>  Rather than vast history, maybe you could limit your area of research of ALD to one aspect such as its history or origins, for example:<br>  <br>  1 - Medical or diagnostic history(? - not sure what the term would be) but:  ALD damages the adrenal glands, the disorder can begin as Addison's disease, an adrenal gland disorder. 1-physical symptoms, behavioral changes…<br>  <br>  ==>How the disease is detected (the tests, diagnosis etc.) and discovered by Lorenzo Odone.<br>  <br>  2 - The epidemiology: It is not indigenous to any particular group of people. X-ALD is an X-Linked disorder that affects only males. It is transmitted by a female carrier. Since this is the case, Do All Boys with ALD Die? Who was Lorenzo Odone?<br>  <br>  ==>The prognosis and cure rate could be a transition sentence here<br>  <br>  3 - It’s notoriety/public awareness: is commonly known to American's as "Lorenzo's Oil Disease", named after an 1993 Oscar nominated film starring Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte. It is based on a family's experience with the disease.<br>  _________________________________-<br>  Anywho, I'm not scientifically minded so you probably have to rearrange things in a way that flows :) <br>  <br>  **You might want to read through these reviews about the movie if you have not seen the move. Here is a link to "Lorenzo's Oil" DVD on Amazon. It is a true story, but the reason I think glossing through the reviews will help is that you will pick up ways to phrase a lot of the symptoms of the disease and get a better feel for the topic. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lorenzos-Oil-Nick-Nolte/product-reviews/B0001CNRAM/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Lorenzos-Oil-Nick-...</a><br>  <br>  A Biology paper does not have to be dry.

PfE6bg5iaa	ick, that's a very ambiguous prompt.<br>  <br>  so I think it's an OK topic<br>  <br>  I personally would avoid political topics, just because if you get a admissions officer who disagrees with your viewpoint they may be more critical of your essay.<br>  <br>  Think of admissions essays as a way for the college to learn who you are. Try to keep them personal (of course, if you have family or something un Cuba then this is a personal topic). <br>  <br>  For example, if you have a family member with alzheimers or cancer, how about discussing the disease and the search for a cure? <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CU3v6N7zaa	I think that topic would be good if you feel strongly about it. <br>  For example, when I was applying to UT, and writing the same essay, I wrote about intolerance.

After all, if colleges only accepted students that came from an IB program they wouldn't have very many students.|`|jIM4HpUGaa	A lot of people want to take the IB program, well it is a good program though sometimes a little annoying, but you are probably way better off doing AP courses. AP courses can get you a heck of a lot farther than IB ones if you plan on heading to a post secondary school (e.g. College). Take your pick + good luck (: Seriously, trust me, you will still get into a college (as long as you don't happen to fail anytime soon) even if you don't take IB classes, the only difference is their courses have a more international focus, its still the SAME currriculum. So chill!

Start by reading the questions at the end of the chapter and THEN read the chapter.  The questions will key you into the most important information in the chapter.  That kind of directed reading will make it easier for you to remember what you've read.  Answering the questions will then help fix the knowledge into your head.

Wait a second - I'll take a gullibility pill.<br>  <br>  It is a part of a criminal indictment , it means that you gained assent or prevented refusal by coercion. A man who rapes a woman while holding a knife doesn't need to make a threat with the knife, the fact of its presence is coercion. A man who has a woman totally isolated and demands sex has not necessarily got consent, even if she agrees to it as she might feel coerced by the lack of potential help and the implied threat if she refuses.<br>  <br>  A woman's assent/consent needs to be clear and incontrovertible. You need to be sure that the response you get would the same one that you would get if she was surrounded by a group of her friends and family.  It isn't hard to figure out - if you try.

gfOGZtmPaa	There are definitely a few options for you:<br>  <br>  - First of all, if you know where your college fund is or what kind of fund it is, you should contact somebody at that bank/institution. Many kinds of college savings accounts require that they be signed over to the student at the age of 18. It's at least a shot to look into.<br>  <br>  - Secondly, I'd try to contact your financial aid office and see if your family may be eligible for a financial aid appeal. The appeal would basically say that your parents' earnings on their 2008 taxes are no longer a realistic picture of your family's finances. You'd have to show supporting documentation, but it might make you eligible for additional funds.<br>  <br>  - Another option would be to have one of your parents (step-father counts) apply for, and be denied a parent plus loan. If they do this, you may become eligible for additional Unsubsidized Stafford loan money. For more help on this, your financial aid office should have information about where you can apply. <br>  <br>  Basically, talk to your financial aid office and see what they recommend. There are definitely options available for you to pursue your educational goals. It might take some extra work on your part, but it pays off in the end.

Topaz, pearl, ruby, blood stone and garnet<br>   <br>   <br>  Characteristics of This Name<br>  <br>  Your number is: 9<br>  <br>  The characteristics of #9 are: Humanitarian, giving nature, selflessness, obligations, creative expression.<br>  <br>  The expression or destiny for #9: The expression that you exhibit is represented bythe number 9. Your talents center in humanistic interests and approaches. You like to help others as you were intended to be the 'big brother or big sister' type. You operate best when you follow your feelings and sense of compassion, and allow yourself to be sensitive to the needs of others. You work well with people, and have the potential to inspire. This suggests that you could successfully teach or counsel. Creative ability, imagination and artistic talent (often latent) of the highest order are present in this expression. It's possible that you're not using or developing all of these capabilities at this time. Some of your talents may have been used at an earlier time in your life, and some may still be latent. Be aware of your capabilities, so that you can make use of them at appropriate times.<br>  <br>  If you are able to achieve the potential of your natural expression in this life, you are capable of much human understanding and have a lot to give to others. Your personal ambitions are likely to be maintained in a very positive perspective, never losing sight of an interest in people, and a sympathetic, tolerant, broad-minded and compassionate point of view. You are quite idealistic, and disappointed at the lack of perfection in the world. You have a strong awareness of your own feeling as well as those of others. Friendships, affection, and love are extremely important.<br>  <br>  Undeveloped or ignored, the negative side of the 9 expression can be very selfish and self-centered. If you do not actively involve yourself with work that benefits others, you may tend to express just the opposite characteristics. It is your role to be very involved with other people and their needs, but it may be difficult for you achieve this role. Aloofness, lack of involvement, and a lack of sensitivity mark the low road of this expression.<br>   <br>  Soul Urge of  This Name<br>  <br>  Your Soul Urge number is: 9<br>  <br>  A Soul Urge number of 9 means: With a 9 Soul Urge, you want to give to others, usually in a humanitarian or philanthropic manner. You are highly motivated to give friendship, affection and love. And you are generous in giving of your knowledge and experience. You have very sharing urges, and you are likely to have a great deal to share. Your concern for others makes you a very sympathetic and generous person with a sensitive and compassionate nature.<br>  <br>  You are able to view life in very broad and intuitive terms. You often express high ideals and an inspirational approach to life. If you are able to fully realize the potential of your motivation, you will be a very self-sacrificing person who is able to give freely without being concerned about any return or reward.<br>  <br>  As with all human beings, you are prone to sometimes express the negative attitudes inherent to your Soul Urges. You may become too sensitive and tend to express emotions strongly at times. There can be significant conflict between higher aims and personal ambitions. You may resent the idea of giving all of the time and, in fact, if there is too much 9 energy in your nature you may reject the idea. You may often be disappointed in the lack of perfection in yourself and others.<br>   <br>  Inner Dream of This  Name<br>  Your Inner Dream number is: 9<br>  <br>  An Inner Dream number of 9 means: You dream of being creative, intellectual, and universal; the selfless humanitarian. You understand the needy and what to help them. You would love to be a person people count on for support and advice.|`|C3cH7RALaa	the most luminous object in universe|`|VIFCt1RJaa	EQUAL TO LIFE  LIKE WATER

One of the strange things about English.|`|8TFtxm3yaa	None, they both mean " easily ignited " The reason for the confusion comes from people thinking that the prefix in- of inflammable is the Latin negative prefix in- (which is commonly used in English, e.g. indecent).

MoaIQPvCaa	Yes, you can start homeschooling even at this late in the school year. I know that Charity Christian Academy has worked with some transfer students who were on a block schedule.

Charity accepted that and granted partial credit for courses that were in process.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	You can home school anytime during the school year.|`|6fVzzNhiaa	Because you mention taking your regents, I'm assuming you're in New York, and NY has some of the more fiddly homeschooling regulations.  Because of this, I'd suggest that you or your parents join a NY-specific homeschool list and ask your fellow New Yorkers how they go about fitting their homeschooling into the NY requirements.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds like a cop-out, but I think you need accurate and specific guidance, not general advice.<br>  <br>  (if you aren't living in NY, then you'll have to look for the laws of the state you do live in)<br>  <br>  If you began homeschooling and acquired the materials used in the classes you are enrolled with, then you could continue those studies on your own.  You wouldn't be with your school class, and you'd have to maintain your own records.  Your parents would have to request a copy of your credits/classes from the school and you would start tracking your credits from there, not from 'scratch.'<br>  <br>  If you withdraw from school, I don't know how that would affect your PLATO enrollment, especially if the enrollment there is dependent on being sponsored by your local school.

I, and most of my fellow students turned out to be perfectly well-rounded individuals. I'm currently in my penultimate year at the best university in the country. Even though I expect a first, I've chosen to go into teaching, so that I can help others do well and pass on the exceptional education that I received.<br>  <br>  The fact that you've said that one does not learn at a state school is just another example of your ignorance. Of course we learned! My school wasn't in the richest part of the country, sure, but 70% of my year went to university, and we certainly had no issues with knifings or pregnant 14-year-olds.<br>  <br>  To be honest, OP, there's little difference between state schools and public schools, other than in the attitudes of some holier-than-thou types.

s8QbZ0RLaa	Rumpelstiltskin is a character from one of the Grimm's tales.|`|PnPVoakoaa	The name Rumpelstilzchen in German means literally "little rattle stilt". (A stilt is a post or pole which provides support for a structure.) A rumpelstilt or rumpelstilz was the name of a type of goblin, also called a pophart or poppart that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to rumpelgeist ("rattle ghost") or poltergeist ("noisy ghost"), a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are mummarts or boggarts and hobs that are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.)<br>  <br>  The earliest known mention of Rumpelstiltskin occurs in Johann Fischart's Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua of 1577 (a loose adaptation of Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel) which refers to an "amusement" for children named "Rumpele stilt or the Poppart".<br>  <br>  Another tale revolves about a girl trapped by false claims about her spinning abilities: The Three Spinners. However, the three women who assist that girl do not demand her first born, but that she invite them to her wedding and say that they are relatives of hers. With this more reasonable request, she complies, and is freed from her hated spinning when they tell the king that their hideous looks spring from their endless spinning. In one Italian variant, she must discover their names, as with Rumpelstiltskin, but not for the same reason: she must use their names to invite them, and she has forgotten them.

It also demonstrates that trying to be non violent in a violent world may be a valiant practice and to be admired, but it isn't getting the recognition that it deserves, apparently it is not helping towards resolution of the problem. I do not know of an answer. Boycotting goods made in China may be one way of putting pressure on the Chinese but they are known to react badly to such pressure and too many in the west are only too happy to purchase goods at the lowest price, even if that means supporting a regime of which they do not approve.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Go to your professor and tell her/him that you are having trouble finding a partner (this is why I never let students pick their own groups - someone always ends up getting humiliated!).  You will undoubtedly end up in some group.<br>  <br>  Once that has happened, be honest with yourself.  Why did you get left out?  There are several possibilities.  On the side which suggests that this might be a fluke, there are the possibility that everyone in that class already knows one another, and they don't know you.  That can easily be fixed.  Or maybe the students have some biases and are afraid to work with someone who looks like you do (unfortunately, I've seen that happen, which is why I usually assign groups).  Honestly, though, it is more likely to be the case that something about you is causing them to reject you.  Have you worked with any of them before?  Then maybe they found that you didn't do your share of the work, or that you were stubborn and insisted on everything being done your way, or that you were unreliable.  Maybe you were unpleasant to others in the group.  If you haven't worked with anyone in class before, do you talk a lot in class?  Often students will judge how easy you will be to work with from that, and they may feel that either you talk too much or that your questions and comments aren't very good ones, or that you annpy the instructor.  Maybe you have a reputation at your school for being difficult to work with.  Even if you don't know anyone in your class, it is possible that someone's friend or roommate does know you, and word has gotten around.|`|3eccb178dd548622010bf484df469c7baa	first off, why does nobody want to group with you? is it a social thing, or are you known for slacking off?

LeaUjOoUaa	It sounds right about not getting a Pell Grant if you are just seeking a certificate. You have to be working toward a degree. The Hope grant is for either a certificate or degree so you would still get that grant. When you transfer, if you work toward a degree there, you would then be eligible to get a Pell Grant (as long as you meet any other requirements such as income level requirements) and the Hope Grant. The great thing about that is you do not pay back grants so less need for loans. Also, degrees tend to gain you more in career fields. You could make more money, be eligible for promotion and can compete with other job applicants with a degree. In other words, the degree will only be better for your career path so if you have the chance to go for the degree and get extra grants to see your through the financing, I would go for it.|`|KZ2QjAx7aa	SHOULD TRY TO GET A DEGREE MATE!|`|ilf5ooq2aa	careers.scienceontheweb.net - try this site.

The term is also used as an adjective (An ad hoc committee was formed), and has given rise to the noun adhocism for the tendency to use temporary, provisional, or improvised methods to deal with a particular problem. [Early 1600s] <br>  <br>  Business Dictionary: Ad Hoc <br>  <br>  For this particular purpose, an ad hoc committee is one commissioned for a special purpose; an ad hoc attorney is one designated for a particular client in a special situation.<br>  <br>  Law Encyclopedia: Ad Hoc <br>  <br>  [Latin, For this; for this special pur- pose.] An attorney ad hoc, or a guardian or curator ad hoc, is one appointed for a special purpose, generally to represent the client or infant in the particular action in which the appointment is made.<br>  <br>  Ad hoc is a Latin phrase which means "for this [purpose]".

Yjn1T4mNaa	Not bad. Just go back through it and read it out loud to yourself. You really need to work on your grammar and punctuation. But everything else seems pretty good. I edited it for you to the best of my ability. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Have you ever dreamt of having a child that looks like Harry Potter? Well it is no longer considered magic but it is very much in the face of reality. You can make you child look like Batman or Superman, and they could break through metal walls, fly with X-ray vision and save the world from destruction. Okay, maybe not that far but you get what I mean. Yes, this ‘magic’ is called Genetic Modification, or Genetic Engineering. It is possible to make your children look like Tom Cruise; Genetic Modification goes so far that scientists say that they can give a brain that is as smart as Albert Einstein. Can you believe it? You can have someone who looks like Paris Hilton with the brain of Einstein! You are probably thinking that this is too good to be true and that I am probably lying but let me explain to you what Genetic Modification is and the many advantages it brings along with the many problems it may create in the future.<br>  <br>  Genetic Modification! The name says it all. It is a bit like cloning, except for some difference. With cloning you can make someone look identical to their parents. But Genetic Modification can change the characteristics of a living organism, or you can even remove bad genes which run in the family, for example, cancer, heart disease and eyesight problems. Plants and animals can even be given characteristics. To do this they change the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. If they want to put in a specific gene, they use a gene gun. It fires microscopic bullets; no these are not life-threatening bullets coated with gunpowder, but ones coated in foreign DNA into a plant or embryo. (Embryo is just another fancy name for a fertilized egg.) The foreign DNA combines with the host’s DNA and alters the host’s genetic make-up.<br>  <br>  Simple, isn’t it? This technology allows us to physically change the appearance or any genes of a plant or animal. It brings with it many advantages. Genetic Modification is becoming very popular in plants, and is mainly aimed at crop production. Using genetic modification they can improve the quality of the crops like the flavour, appearance and nutritional value. They can also increase the tolerance of the crops, like less need for water. Genetic Modification food supporters say that Genetic Engineering is essential in feeding the worlds population. The reasons for this is that in countries where the soil is poor, scientists can use GM to make crops grow in those conditions, and can even make summer crops grow in winter.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	Good really good. But with genetic engineering you can't really make someone exactly like a celebrity there will be a difference because it is also effected by the other half of the chromosome half from the dad and half from the mother. You could modify the gene by collecting other peoples genes like you might want someone with blue eyes and black hair and you get that strand of gene to make what you want. And yes as always something will go wrong your child could die and they could just clone it again and you'll never know the difference unless the child ages much faster and has a shorter life spand then you'll know that your child is a clone|`|flQP4tM3aa	Yeah sounds alright, but its not a simple as hey im just gunna shoot some genes into a cell nucleus then hey presto my pet elephant can fly.

And using ambulance twice seems redundant.<br>  <br>  How about: In the distance I hear the piercing sound of an ambulance siren drawing closer, to admit another victim." <br>  <br>  I felt putting it in two sentence made it less interesting, although you might need to pick up the pace in that area of the story or be writing to a younger audience or some other consideration.<br>  <br>  And what's wrong with having it come from a distance, draw closer and arrive. That's fast paced. Maybe some would have a problem so it's really your call. <br>  <br>  Editors will add their own punctuation, if it's not too incoherent as to be mind boggling and cause a lot of extra work. They need to feel important too.<br>  <br>  Even if you get paid by the word, cut, cut, cut.|`|hRYwuCFRaa	In the distance I hear a piercing siren as the ambulance draws closer, soon to arrive and deliver another victim.

oe7ZogB9aa	The most important factor in the success of an organization or of an individual is commitment. Commitment fuels action. You must demonstrate consistency in the practice of your beliefs. The strength of your adherence to identifiable beliefs is reflected through your persistence and your ability to stand for what you believe. Genuine commitment stands the test of time.|`|jygcvFAMaa	here's an example, just follow this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.njeit.org/pdf/drinking_water.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.njeit.org/pdf/drinking_water....</a>

Else, try not worrying about petty nothings from morons.<br>  <br>  It helps to focus on things that actually matter, like what you're going to do after high school.  Contrary to popular opinion, HS is not everything.  It's four short years that you'll be glad you're done with forever.|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	It may be too late, but work on your witty retorts. Creeps do this to see what reaction they can get out of you. <br>  <br>  Try some phrases like, <br>  <br>  "No offense, but you know you have a really tiny ****."<br>  <br>  "Aww, you taught your monkey to talk."<br>  <br>  Or you can go the "pity me" route:<br>  <br>  "The doctor said the chemotherapy does that, but it should go away when the cancer goes into remission."<br>  <br>  Sit down with your bestie and make a list, practice them, and have them ready. Meanwhile, work on clearing your face:<br>  <br>  Keep your hair short and clean.<br>  Wash in morning and evening with witch hazel water.<br>  Crunch up an aspirin - not ibuprofen or anything, but real aspirin - dissolve in water, and wipe over your worst zits.<br>  When you have a fresh one coming at night, put white toothpaste on it and leave it alone; wash off in the morning.<br>  Don't wash with soap; instead, use plain water. Hot water opens the pores, and rinsing with cold water after a thirty-second application of a hot washcloth will get more off your face than any amount of scrubbing.<br>  If nothing else works, see your doctor for an antibiotic.<br>  <br>  Good luck. It won't last, I promise.|`|b9qqQt7maa	Depends on how big you are... think you could kick his ***?<br>  <br>  Or get a funnel and funnel quick cement into his gas tank

Few of those sites are writing something really original, and few dissertation advisers wouldn't realize that wasn't your work.  Just do a crappy job yourself or don't bother - if you can't do a decent job yourself, what makes you think you should get a degree?|`|NvrVjOhBaa	It's clear that few people understand what a dissertation is.|`|XpnnNLkOaa	I concur.  If you can't write it yourself, you hardly deserve the degree.  At best it's dishonest, at worst, negligent.  Do your own work.|`|zRH530kqaa	It is popular that people buy off of these sites paper mills. Most times the essays wind up on a website eventually and you will get expelled ( kicked out ) if this happens.
