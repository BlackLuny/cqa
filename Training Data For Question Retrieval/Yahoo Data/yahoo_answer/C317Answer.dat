KTP2ah73aa	Two rednecks, Bubba and Cooter, decide to go to college. Bubba goes first, and he is advised to take maths, history and logic. <br>  <br>  -- "What's logic?" says Bubba. <br>  -- "Well, let me give you an example," says the professor. "Do you own a tractor?" <br>  -- "Sure do," says Bubba. <br>  -- "Okay. Then I assume, using logic, that you have a yard." <br>  -- "That's real good," says Bubba, in awe. <br>  -- "Logic also tells me that since you have a yard, you also have a house. Is that right?" <br>  -- "Gawly!” says Bubba. <br>  -- "And since you own a house and a house is tough to take care of by yourself, the odds are that you have a wife. Right?" <br>  -- "Betty Mae! This is incredible!" <br>  -- "Finally, since you have a wife, logically I can assume you are heterosexual. Is that right?" <br>  -- "You are absolutely right! Why that's the most fascinatin' thang I ever heerd of. I can't wait to take this here logic class!" <br>  <br>  Bubba, proud of the new world opening up to him, goes back into the hallway where Cooter is waiting. <br>  -- "So what classes are ya takin’?" says Cooter. <br>  -- "Maths, history and logic," says Bubba. <br>  -- "What in tarnation is logic?" <br>  -- "Let me give you an example," says Bubba. "Do you own a tractor?" <br>  -- "No." <br>  -- "Then you’re gay."|`|WmqfsK7Taa	blonde mafia that there is funny I dont care who you are!!|`|Rhw3mmn4aa	Lol, funny, but what's the question?|`|jIM9CbQJaa	not bad made me smile.|`|yHEk5IJoaa	Lol. Thats funny. Whats your question about it though O.o|`|QubdBy5Oaa	nice|`|Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!!    Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  An extraordinarily handsome man decided he had the responsibility to marry the perfect woman so they could produce beautiful children beyond compare.  With that as his mission he began to search for the perfect woman.<br>  <br>  Shortly thereafter he met a redneck who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the redneck and asked for permission to marry one of them.<br>  <br>  The redneck simply replied, "They're lookin' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look 'em over and pick the one you want."<br>  <br>  The man dated the first daughter. The next day the redneck asked for the man's opinion.<br>  <br>  "Well," said the man, "she's just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice...pigeon-toed."  The redneck nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter.<br>  <br>  The next day, the redneck again asked how things went. "Well,"the man replied, "she's just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell...cross-eyed."  The redneck nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did.<br>  <br>  The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming, "She's perfect, just perfect. She's the one I want to marry."<br>  <br>  So they were wed right away. Months later the baby was born. When the man visited the nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law and asked how such a thing could happen considering the beauty of the parents.<br>  <br>  "Well," explained the redneck... "She was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell... pregnant when you met her."|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Eeewww that is gross, but funny too, very well done...!
R4F05z4Faa	Everything is good|`|FE96lTPLaa	A Brief Review <br>   <br>            The configuration of Gemini Ascendant ( Lagna ) rising with Sagittarius Navamsa and Gemini Dreskana in the first Pad of Ardra indicates a life full of ups and downs, more downs than ups if you are not careful. There is no escaping from the distinct possibility of encountering adversities. But they can be fought only if you take preventive action from the very beginning. The only silver lining is that life is likely to be better from the age of 25 provided you act with equanimity giving up your wayward activities.<br>  <br>            Actually, for a person of your intelligence and knowledge, you should go far in life. If you stick to any one chosen path with courage and determination, you will emerge on top. Professions like journalism and writing, in addition to the fine arts, will pay dividends.<br>  <br>            But the hurdle you will have to clear first is your habit of indecision and aspiring for changes frequently. Otherwise, you would be a rolling stone which won’t be to your advantage. Your intolerance with any kind of delay and eagerness for short-cuts, brushing aside accepted norms and rules, has got to be overcome.<br>  <br>            You can accomplish any job you undertake with a lot of grace. But the difficulty is you lack concentration and switch over from one assignment to another without completing the one on hand.<br>  <br>            It is your excessive ambition that drives you to do these things, because you want to get rich in a flash. It is this streak which finds you sometimes working at two places simultaneously to boost your income. But this will only be a passing phase.<br>  <br>            Another problem with you is about getting on with people. A person who can’t suffer mediocre, you will constantly change your circle of friends. They too find it difficult to find a common wavelength with you, as you are a person who is not easy to understand.<br>  <br>            You have the uncanny power to grasp the ideas of others and display them later as your own. This undoubtedly makes a tremendous impression on others, but you fail to convert this to your advantage. There is no other way for you to rise in life than putting to profitable use your many-faceted talents.<br>  <br>            Caution, as against recklessness and desperation, should be the key word in your life. Hence note the following points and act accordingly :<br>  <br>            Stick to yellow, green, blue, purple and pink colours which are favourable to you. At any cost, keep clear of black and red.<br>  <br>            Rely on numbers 7 and 3; shun 4 and 8.<br>  <br>            The ideal week days for you are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Monday. Tuesday and Saturday are just no good as they bring worries, difficulties and financial losses.|`|9dqZfVIBaa	if you do not feel bad i want to advice you that plz do not believe in astrology..........there is nothing called as predicting the future..........your future is in your hands....only you can predict your future not anyone else!|`|2KfSs6S1aa	GOOOOSE

It is a great show piece for a male and female with the talent to blend. "Don't Go Breaking My Heart", by Elton John and KiKi Dee it's old but pretty good. There have been some classic duets, over the last sixty years or more. Do a search on the internet and see what turns up.

PfJCin0caa	you have to go to file then burn CD<br>  and it'll take time to transfer the movie|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) The film you have burned (transferred) onto the DVD disk WONT play because of x2 issues. <br>  <br>  No.1 These are Encryption & Copy Right Protection (i.e. such as MS WMP Digital Rights media i.e. you don't have a license to view the content because you haven't paid for a license). This movie is encrypted to protect its copy right against fraud, yes! such encryption can be cracked but its not a simple process. Then its also a moral question i.e. is it OK to download a film & view it with out paying for it?<br>  <br>  No.2 Regional DVD player settings. The film probably has regional settings embedded into it. Which means it can only be played in certain regions (locations) in the world. This means your movie player must also be set to the correct regional settings before the content will be viewable on the player (i.e. player settings).<br>  <br>  Ivan<br>  <br>  computer veteran.|`|k9pXT7sxaa	make sure you have a dvd burner... and just google a program for avi to dvd or something|`|HQaIVOhtaa	If you put the file on the DVD straight through Windows, it will treat the DVD as a data disc (like putting homework on a CD) and it won't play, as you found out. You have to find a program like Cyberlink DVD Suite (which comes with Vista on many new computers) or type 'dvd maker' into sites like www.download.com (or good keywords for Google are 'free download dvd maker', assuming you want freeware). Try a few of the ones that pop up and see which works best for you. Beware of viruses and trojans, as always when trying to find free software, and make sure your virus software is up-to-date. Crack and freeware sites are often riddled with nasties. Good luck!|`|bP6tE3anaa	you will need a program like nero or convertx to dvd to put your movie onto dvd to play.<br>  <br>  go to www.mininova.org and search for eithe rof these programs|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	Use <a href="http://www.dvdstyler.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdstyler.org/</a>|`|4NNDcYZNaa	It depends on what file type it is. If you just put the file onto the dvd, it wont work because its just a file and a regular dvd player only understand a dvd format not a movie file. You have to process that file into something a dvd player can understand. If you have vista the windows dvd maker thats included (just type it into the start menu )can handle process the movie file for you and then once your done the dvd will be able to be read by dvd players.|`|AA10886027	You can't do it if the DVD is copy protected, and I think all downloads like this will be.

AA10747402	Being 14 or even 16 you are still at a point where your parents and your friends parents should know what's going on with you all. I think the party and the limo ride is an awesome idea. but as for the hotel, you will want to make sure that parents are involved and know about the stay. Some parents of the kids involved may not go for a hotel stay with out any adults. <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to inform everyone of the hotel stay, find out who can go, get an adult to go with you but to have a separate room close by.|`|XnCiiQ6Kaa	Yeah that dose. Me and my best friend are going to do that to (even though we're only 13). My birthday is aug. 24th and her's is nov.12th<br>  so we want are sweet 16 on Halloween!! ^~^ Come on how wouldn't want a birthday on there favorite holiday?<br>  So yeah it sounds like fun. I like birthdays kinda...<br>  You got to get older though -___-<br>  I'm 5 and holding ^ ~ ^<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED ^ ~ ^|`|5bl8pKkGaa	YES! that sounds super :)|`|uojR7vmEaa	wow yeah me and my friend might do a double sweet 16 but not as fun as that!!!!|`|IPFCtyvQaa	I think that would be awesome!<br>  <br>  Not everyone needs to come so you souldn't have to tell them|`|PyvVuFTOaa	yeah!|`|rSIF5jtSaa	It would be fun but, note that renting a hall is very expensive. It's about 600 dollars. Not to mention the limo ride will be about another 200 dollars (minimum 2 hour usage). And a DJ is about 400 dollars. You're looking at like a wedding here girlfriend lol. And that doesn't count the hotel room.....you have some talking over to do with the rents.|`|vNfckAYCaa	nothing special about  turning 16<br>  \the mtv show sweet 16<br>  destroyed millions of girls heads<br>  with the dumbness...<br>  like come on who by a 16 year old girl can $80,000 car<br>  as her first car... cmon think about it<br>  u should just call it a par-tay|`|EDMAqIcBaa	that sounds sooo good!<br>  i would defintely try and arrange that if you could<br>  people would be talking about it for ages<br>  however you should probaly ask your parents about it first before you start telling people because it does sound really really expensive|`|KMCDFCQdaa	Yess you should totally do that it would be sooo cool if you guys did that. I wish I would be able to do that for my sweet 16|`|FYPl8CYjaa	yes well if i was your friend i would be pleased it sounds way fun, the hotel sounds like such a good idea!|`|NR7cVDxoaa	that sounds amazing :)|`|n9y5ydnVaa	YES!!!

But def worth it.|`|w97fahp4aa	although it sounds like a great idea now when you acctually start planning it can be so stressful that it might strain your friendship if you and her are REALLY good friends then go for it it sounds awesome! but if the stress could ruin your friendship id suggest not doing it and who knows things might change but its so far away i wouldn;t worry too much :)|`|vrImLiv0aa	yes and no.<br>  <br>  First your birthdays bit far away to have a joint birthday. :/<br>  <br>  Also you could stay in hotels like you said but instead been secret about it all, (may cause arguments with other friends) if they wish to stay there also, they pay.|`|wQ9EeeX6aa	That sounds like a lot of fun... I did that with my bestfriend but we got cars and drove our selves to the hotel. just be careful of all the drama thatould happen from you keeping the hotel asecret from everyone when they find out! But have fun!|`|sA5Td5vAaa	well you and your friend katy have lots of time to decide what you want to do for your sweet 16. But remember to have fun and to always be safe and overall your plans for a sweet 16 said great. :)|`|5KGiumXNaa	It dounds awesome. Good luck with the funding... But Personally i would love something like that.<br>  <br>  Remember though If you keep it a secret you may realise that some people might say that they're busy or that they can't make it...|`|20NWAmELaa	sounds like a lot of fun but you have to make sure that no one but the people going to the hotel... it could cause alot of problems if it got out at the party|`|74we4Dgbaa	That would be really fun, but make sure the friends your bringing to the hotel, don't blab it out by accident ;)<br>  <br>  & lucky @ the limo ride.<br>   haha, - delaney|`|L4r1kmPQaa	I don't think that it's fun. I think that you should have a few more friends to celebrate it with.|`|Y8EDyBrNaa	I think that would be really cool. <br>  Combined party's are always fun<br>  Good luck with your party. Have a great time and Happy birthday to both of you.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Amazing, yes, I hope you can pull it off!|`|CR1wcWouaa	yeah! if you can get ppl not to talk about the limo ride...plus do they want to sit in the car for 45 minutes?|`|EKdvJRyPaa	That's sounds like an awsome sweet 16...

They sound pretty good tho. Every now and then they seem to have some brutal vocals in there. Not really my thing anymore. I mean I have a special place for Dream Theater I guess I will always listen to them because I have listened to them for years and years. Thanks for sharing.<br>  <br>  BQ: I would love to tell you but I would be here for hours.

IDK what is so "Prog" to their sound, but they have a sound that makes me think of a mix of 80s Power and Hair Metal,  kinda, though a lot of that is defintiely from the vocals.<br>  <br>  So far though, I like a lot about them, and think they lay down solid riffs.<br>  <br>  As for similiar bands... maybe Evergrey?  They are a Prog Power mix, with clean vocals too.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ8PXXrCasE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ8PXXrCa...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bGp7LCRTlM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bGp7LCRT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0wnvLknQmw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0wnvLknQ...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaOk_IYIKZk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaOk_IYIK...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC83HAT72BY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC83HAT72...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89giDpJfbVM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89giDpJfb...</a><br>  <br>  BQ-  People, I suppose, since I have extreme anxiety disorder, and cannot stand being in crowds.

s0p70EHVaa	it does sound like him <br>  But only Tom knows if it was real or not.<br>  <br>  No one knows the real story, the girl could been out there all night, or yelling at him while he was in his house or something. I mean if someone was waiting outside my house I would pretty pissed too. Especially because that's where you go for privacy. <br>  <br>  Maybe he was having a bad day and just lost it, everyone has bad days and that fan just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br>  And no celebrity is is perfect. I'm not saying that girl deserved it, but i'm not saying she didn't. <br>  Like I said, nobody knows what really happened.|`|FHBpJ3qvaa	i don't think that's him......i wouldn't believe that tom would do that......but even if it was him, i think he acted a little rude, but at the same time i understand him cause he was at his house the only place he can actually have privacy at and he was probably relaxing or something, and then they come to ruin his privacy.......i mean if u wanna meet them go to a concert, a signing or something, but not his house......i mean yeah his famous and all the fans love him, but his also a human who deserves a break and some privacy.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	if that wuz really true the fan didn't deserve this becuz she just wanted an autogaph which wuz easy he could of just signed a pic take a pic w/ the fan and go back home... but maybe he wuz busy and wanted some privacy maybe he wuz doing something important.... <br>  <br>  well to be honest i don't think it's true becuz Tom is a nice and sweet person i think a tokio hotel hater just recorded that and maybe thats not even tom... but thats my opinion and tom wouldn't do that he's muche nicer and better than that I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	That sounds like his voice in the video :o Wow.  Im not sure whether to believe it or not. <br>  I would have done the same though if someone was stalking me outside my door .<br>  Poor Tom|`|MJlTRs8uaa	YES! look TH is TH and they are awesome but the guys need their privacy *everyone does* and if they ask for it, why not give it to them?<br>  They give us their ALL as TH and they are amazing out of TH so if they ask for privacy nicely and we don't give it to them, they have to react some way!<br>  <br>  I still have some doubt about wether if it's him or not, cuz who ever wrote that article could have lied 'bout wat he was saying, but if it's all true then those girls deserve it!|`|aitD50yuaa	My opionon of this, I think it's probably not him, a lot of people over there probably sound like him, or try to, and they just recordeed it, and the girls could have been ex girlfriends that gave him a hard time before, and never bothered for a long time, and maybe now just want something from him since he is popular that's what I get from it, Witch sounds more like it.|`|gew4KVFfaa	i think tom had every rite to say that. i would get pretty pissed too if ppl were following me around invading my personal space 24/7. i feel bad for him... maybe he was just having a bad day. we dont know. being in the lime light all the time is oviously not everything it seems to be. i think ppl should have to know when to back off and leave someone the f**k alone.|`|MvMR53CWaa	I dont think sooo.... That is just writing. NO hard evidence. And that video has no running footage. It could have just been a person with a similar voice. I know Tom and Bill are grateful for their fans and success and would never do that to a fan.|`|pgmXNpuOaa	I dont believe it one bit....someone could have made that to make it sound real....but it didnt even sound real to me anyway....plus does it really sound like tom to push away a fan let alone a GIRL?|`|3lF21cFkaa	I think it was a bit rude.. but the girl was standing at their HOUSE and invading their privacy if it was at a signing or concert or something that would be a different story|`|8jxoTBWIaa	I think it was really rude but it must get annoying having people following you everywhere. I mean everyone has a breaking point. Maybe this was his? =[|`|wEt7UiTsaa	yup if it is true<br>  its his privacy|`|2ab909820942304668ac078e08751277aa	wow.<br>  assuming that it was tom's voice in the video (and it really did sound like him)...<br>  the fan definitely deserved it. standing outside his house is plain stalking, its that simple. it doesn't matter who he is, how famous he is, or what he does, he still needs privacy! and deserves to not be bothered while living in his own home! its pretty much the only place he can guarantee peace and quiet without all the anxieties that come with being so well known, and to have people ruining that sense of security he has at home is not fair to him.<br>  <br>  this video doesn't make me like him any less, if anything it only reiterates how normal celebrities are. they still want to be left alone at times, and don't deserve to be pestered 24/7 for autographs or to take pictures or anything of that sort.|`|T4DWkJRvaa	It waz a litle mean but, he did have thee right to yell at them cuz it iz hiz house und he deservez to be alone they shouldnt of have gone there in the 1st place :) Thatz why they hav consertrz etc. to get there autogrfz.<br>  <br>  ....Srry my english iz a bit bad...|`|5uSHRO8caa	i dont think it was really him it didnt sound like him, and yeah i mean if that was me i would be pretty angryish|`|1UOIoOzKaa	Yes, I heard that video a few days ago. It really upset me. I just think Tom was in a bad mood and he didn't want fans around him. He was rude to them and they didn't deserve that kind of attitude from him. <br>  But it must be very hard for him to have fans following him and calling him. I think everyone would get sick of it after a bit. And now people posting on the internet doesn't help =[|`|1wNsBNmxaa	yes this really happen he has the right to tell off that girl she is a over obessed fan that will not leave him alone<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???

That would be great!!<br>  <br>  On February 24, 2009, Faith No More announced they would be reforming with a line-up identical to the Album of the Year era.  A prior statement from Mike Patton's publicist suggests they will be touring Europe.

That would be an awesome gift for your dad.  Be a great way to bond, IMO.

9MjDRQ6Waa	Damn that is a very good poem, Im think I do see what u see. I see that a mans life was not all that grate and then his love of his life came a long and then showed him the way out of the the dark cold thing we called "Life". Then I see that she passed away and that he knows that she still loves him. Then I see at the end he hopes that he will see her but, its going to be a little while to see her again. The main thing that I see in this poem is that: Love is a thing that we will never understand & when its gone it will never come again like it did the 1 time. <br>  <br>  MCL Homie <br>  Whoop, Whoop|`|usp5sYuRaa	Awwwww...This is so sad, but so beautiful...awesome.<br>  Keep ya hatchets swingin!|`|XewbBwvKaa	yeah...i see what you see...another awesome poem man!!!

Having that sort of offspring in our world would just make it worse.|`|VrPTLsecaa	No. It is impossible for a person to become pregnant because of what was said in a magazine.

I like him and i think he's a nice guy with a nice voice,and everything, but I just don't think he's really at the same caliber as the rest of them. Also, Adam,Allison and Danny have been my faves since the Top 36, so I'd really love to see them in the Top 3. But after that, I'd actually kind of like to see Danny go. I was waiting all season for an Adam/Danny Finale, but after the duet tonight, I really want it to come down to Adam vs Allison. That would definitely be interesting :).|`|d8a746804766b70bab5d2cadd408c158aa	Kris might be going HOME.<br>  <br>  Danny is way more likable. YES, he messed up tonight but I still like him.

wOnlsOocaa	Lol k Mason is not emo. He's been playing music before emo as we not it now was around. He's Like gothed up shock rock. He didn't have any ribs removed. And he's dated Dita Von Tease, Rose McGowan And Evan Rachel Wood. So he does fine with the ladies. People just don't like him cause they don't dig the way he looks, they listen to rumors and they don't dig his music. Fair enough. Some people just don't like things that are different to what their use to.<br>  <br>  Just to say. Im not a massive Manson fan. I was when I was a kid but I grew out him awhile ago. Not to say he doesn't have some good songs. Also It's not fair to say he isn't a good person. I know when i was a kid i used to feel heaps happy after chilling to manson. Musics a good healthy way to deal with anger. so i dare say he's helped heaps of peeps with **** like that. Rather then starting fights. watch this interveiw and you see he's just a regular guy with brains. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xJVOUuV-I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xJVOUuV...</a>|`|jyRn39Zgaa	he's "weird"?|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	He takes drugs and is scary he screams in his songs.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	first off the reason why people hate him is because they do not listen to his music which would be the jonas brothers music all the time in the dude that said he is emo your are 100% wrong <br>  <br>  <br>  luckyducky444 that is not true that is a myth which was proven if he did have 4 ribs removed he would not be able to breathe in then he would of been dead know your facts before you open your mouth up in start by making a statement like this  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|r8gYkZW7aa	lol...there is no reason to hate him.

nDzenpkwaa	Cooked on a grill is very important for the perfect hot dog.  You can toast the bun.  You put the relish and onion on the bun first.  Then you put the dog.  On top, meat sauce (not chunky but diced meat sauce) with any kind of mustard.  I prefer the spicy deli mustard.  mmmmm<br>  <br>  Oh I am definitely having hot dogs for dinner tonight...|`|NREqhragaa	hot...?

AA11102874	It's an original although the chorus of it sounds VERY similar to Paul Simon's '50 Ways to leave your lover' but I'm sure that's just a coincidence|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	No, I don't think it is. I've just looked online and found this article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_All_Night_(Take_That_song)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_All_Nigh...</a>|`|H4wa95QTaa	I don't think it is
cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I agree...if the blame is going to be placed on someone (and it shouldn't, it was just a matter of timing and circumstance), then Abby is just as responsible as Eden for Brad's death. She shouldn't have invited Eden to the fictional skating party, and Eden shouldn't have gone, but how was Eden to know that Abby was just being her regular snotty self? It's all just a bunch of "what ifs". It happened regardless, and Abby just wants to blame someone, anyone.|`|msUIsv8maa	why dont they fire her like they did Eden|`|lGdzb8aqaa	she is a brat and I agree with you.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i agree with you totally! i can't stand the little snooty witch. And your right she didn't have no right to tell eden that she shouldn't be at noah's party! noah should have told her off and not let her treat eden like that. eden wasn't responsible for brad's death either like you said it was really abby's fault if anybody's cause she faked the party. i can't stand her either and i hope noah or eden puts her in her place or knocks her out. she can't act good either|`|ClRuPRs7aa	Yup, I know what you mean. She's a spoiled brat, self-absorbed, naive and completely narrow minded. She's so annoying and thinks the whole world revolves around her. As for the Noah and Eden thing, she's just being a B****. maybe if she had a life, and maybe a boyfriend she wouldn't care what goes on in someone else's life. And I think she would blame anyone for her dad's death, but Eden is the easiest target. I think everyone needs to give Noah and Eden a break already! They're teenagers who are going out, whatever people, get over it! Everyone is treating them like their five. The only reason bad things are happening is because they make them hide, and they try a new way to be together which ends up in disaster. (His parents should take their own advice, and take responsibility for their actions)|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't care for Abbie either. She is very contrite and she has her nose up in the air like she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth when that is the furthest thing from the truth. I hope the way she was conceived comes to light. I bet that will bring her down a bunch of notches. Ashley is garbage.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Hayley Erin like Abby is only 14 years old. I think Hayley is playing Abby as a spoil rotten rich kid, that is exactly what Abby is. Hayley is doing a great job and for the record, I don't the character either.|`|AASTcFSpaa	Everytime I see her, I always think that she is not a good actress. I think she is trying to hard. She really puts a lot of face and head movements into her speech that I think are way too much.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I really do not like her, but I can say is that she is right about Eden, because Eden is always getting Noah into trouble and Abby is trying to open Noah's eyes.|`|fa4c831f08b161bce2611f5ba6f16824aa	I dont know why the writers wrote her in as she is, they really screwed up this time, she cant act either. I dont like where they are going with her|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	honey, join the club.  I would take eden over that little snotty nose brat|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	Every word u said is sooo true! She sux as an actress & that just don't seem to me what Abby woulda' turned out like.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	She is annoying.|`|BqHEeYA4aa	i dont like her either...but i also dont like eden so i dont care if they want to blame each other for anything......as long as it doesnt take too long on screen. save time for teh actual storylines!|`|Zr2HM6Lbaa	i cant stand her .|`|CvtDsOB4aa	Yes She Does Lack Personality

ob3fUVedaa	I'm torn between 12 and under and 13-17.  <br>  <br>  12 and under sucks because you are completely out of control of your life.  I would never want to be a child again.<br>  <br>  13-17 was hard too because you wanted so bad to grow up, but at the time first experiences are exhilarating.  You will never forget those years.<br>  <br>  18-20 YAY! But limited. No one will take you seriously yet.<br>  <br>  21 and older YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  My best years were 21 and up for sure.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	18-20<br>  Because you have to start making a lot of big desicions|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	13 - 17<br>  <br>  it was for me,you know hormones,no one understands you,old enough to know better,not old enough to make your own decisions|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	13-17<br>  your going through high schooler, and an identity crisis. thats when you are learning about yourself and who you are. thats also the time frame that alot of kids experiment with sex, drugs, and alcohol. <br>  and im in that age group now[17] so im just really bitter and biased towards it lol|`|cYFAo75Yaa	an adult for all the responsibilities...if your not an adult you don't have a clue what is  hard. going to school, cleaning your room or your crush not calling you? please... those things are not hard, but part of growing up. you don't know hard until you are a grown responsible adult|`|RNi6gytSaa	13 - 17<br>  <br>  A transition from middle school to High school. <br>  If u fail your in SERIOUS trouble. <br>  Parent's have the "talk" with you. <br>  Drugs, secx.. etc. <br>  Getting a job. <br>  <br>  =]|`|mlI5wPuTaa	idk im only 13 but soo far 13-17<br>  being 13 sucks!|`|D82wWDsGaa	I love how after 21 it then becomes its own category. HAHA<br>  <br>  You go thru phases in life. Every teenager thinks they have it soooo bad, but the facts are, you don't have to pay for food or your home, or clothes.  You think peer pressure is so bad and life is full of turmoil because of homework, peer pressure, etc.  <br>  <br>  Its all a bunch of bull$hit.  It all depends on your goals and aspirations.  If you set high goals, and it takes you awhile to reach them (like I did) it would seem like your early 20's might be tough.  But if you have no goals, I'm sure you will think right now sucks (because you have nothing to live for).  <br>  <br>  Anyway, since I can tell you are still a teenager, you should start asking questions that target older folks (25-35) and ask questions like:<br>  <br>  "Do you like your career? Yes, no and WHY?"<br>  "Did you have kids at a fairly young age? DO you regret it? WHY?"<br>  "What would you have done differently if could go back in time?"<br>  <br>  See, questions like that will actually educate you so you don't make the same mistakes others make.  Screw your guidance counselor.  You should only take advice from those who have what you want.  Do you WANT to be a guidance counselor? <br>  Well, how about that hot 20 something chick with a nice car. Would you like to be her?  Then start asking her how she did it, and what she could have changed.  I highly doubt she'll tell you being 14 was like growing up in hell.  But I'm sure other 14 year olds will tell you how rough it is.|`|UdemZ27caa	13-17<br>  highschool, hormones, awkwardness.<br>  not knowing anything about life,<br>  find out things the hard way,<br>  pressure of all kinds.<br>  and begginings of relationships.<br>  its a crazy time.|`|7kwLZvE7aa	definitely 13-17 its the hardest time, because your only finding out who you really are, theres lots of pressure like drugs, sex, school, careers, exams etc..|`|6XpmPubKaa	13-17. High school, and middle school. And "finding yourself" Plus you're just growing up in general and getting used to being a young adult.|`|xEt2x4R1aa	21 AND OVER CUZ YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REAL WORLD NOW <br>  BUT IM AVOIDING THE REAL BY GOING TO COLLEGE LOL|`|T6PzMyPBaa	13-17<br>  alot of pressure and trying to fit in/be accepted and so on.|`|83mIrPXzaa	13-17|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	Your teen years.|`|LcBCLiTqaa	13-17.<br>  I'm almost there and I just kind of want to skip that type of age and turn 20 or something.

QCVcaxHcaa	I'm not sure about he Jonas Brothers soundtrack, but Demi Lovato's album I know is not officially released in the UK, and as she is not well-known, I don't think it will be. I know you said your mum won't shop online, but Demi's album is on Amazon.co.uk for ￡13.98, and is exclusive, as it is on no other English shopping website, so you might be able to change your mum's mind with that fact! You can also get it for less than half price on the same website if you DO have it shipped from the states, from ￡1.24 for Postage and Packaging.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	they probably won't sell the  CDs in England but they might sell them online if you looked up those CDs <br>                                   <br>                                      best of luck|`|M9te5MzJaa	I think they should be out there now, try looking on iTunes or use Limewire or Ares to get them
HA3CUl0Jaa	Well I don't really care too much whether or not my music is popular. I went through a phase where I tried as hard as I could not to be a part of the mainstream, but eventually realized how ridiculous that was. Alot of the time I'll be listening to Tool and people will say "Oh I love them!"<br>  <br>     I respond, "Oh really? What are your favorite songs?"<br>     "I like Aenema, and Sober, and uh..."<br>  <br>     And you know that's all fine, because they're just dumb*** sheep, but it really makes me mad when people try so hard to be underground that they drop a band as soon as they get any attention. Even though I'm not really a Kings of Leon fan, I'm even fine with that happening, because it's not the fault of the artist that they're music became mainstream. Take Rush as an example, there are many people who call their newer work assimilationist, but I think that a band changing is O.K, as long as they maintain their musical integrity.|`|yRE2HDr3aa	I can't stand indie hipster kids. Sure I don't have a problem with the Indie bands but when someone listens to certain music to make themselves feel superior to others tastes it's just lame..<br>  <br>  oh yeah popularity doesn't affect the quality of music. A good song is a good song no matter how popular or unpopular it is. It's stupid to hate something because just because it got popular.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	er.... haven't met too many "So-called" Indie Snobs.  Mostly just real indie snobs who deserved the label.  (I  only know  a few who don't htink they aren't ruprior to everyone else).<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, just because a band is unsigne doesn tmake them bad.  Truth is the vast majority of bands would love a major label, as most peole would LOVE to be able to make a living off what they love.  There are a few exceptions, but IMO most of them are rebels without a clue.<br>  <br>  Staying unheard doenst keep one more pure or something.   And the vast majority of Indie Bands i have heard dont have a label becuase they really are just that bad.<br>  <br>  But I guess that just means you have to be a college type top appreciate them.<br>  <br>  <br>  I dislike Music Snobs of anytype.   I may be considered one by some though, so to each their own.<br>  <br>  And I really dont care how popular a band gets, as ong as the fame doesnt change them.  Personally, If I think a band is amazing...why wouldnt I wan them to have all the sucess in the world?<br>  <br>  I would love to run into more 10 year olds who love Iron Maiden.   How would that detract form my listneing pleasure?   It isn't like I got some type of exclusitvity contract with them.|`|K86A0hyEaa	Kings of Leon aren't disliked now by old fans because there in the mainstream, its because they changed there style to sh*tty generic stadium stuff. And when bands break into the mainstream it's more difficult to get tickets to see them, and it could be argued that "band wagon jumpers" who only know one song do kinda waste tickets...

I am not a fan of Twilight and series like that which has a simple love story despite its use of vampires.  I love how the Dark Materials Series incorporates so much into a series- religion, morality, companionship, loyalty, destiny, fate, and much more. It starts with the Golden Compass, moves on to The Subtle Knife, and ends with a bang in Amber Spyglass.  The series is by Philip Pullman and there has been a movie made on the Golden Compass with the James Bond character and Nicole Kidman playing one of the female antagonists.  Trust me, I could not stop reading the series and ended up re-reading them several times over the past few years.

This also helps to steady the load by keeping your weight closer to it, and if it starts to tip you can push down on the handles to get the legs on the ground.|`|IuM7rz5Daa	Pulling is easier, pushing creates a force against the ground thus adding to the workload.|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Pushing it forward or pulling it backward...?|`|UlrvomV5aa	niether. just go get someone to do it for you. lol ummm pushing it.

7464074c37b022b3a56706c8a349d458aa	Love classic rock.  To me its because of the group chemistry. The talent level is much higher.  Write there own songs can all play an instrument etc.  Great music and for the most part you can actually understand what they are saying.|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	Classic Rock is really just a great thing to rock out to, and it never gets old (hence the word classic). I never get tired of my Hendrix, Doors, Deep Purple, etc. I actually went through a big rap phase, and by the end of it I had realized that just like Rock, modern Rap has gone downhill. "Classic Rap," like the Sugar Hill Gang, was great because they actually used real instruments, and actually wrote about real issues. The only rapper who's still around that I like is Eminem, but even he's sold out a bit.|`|wwlb1lznaa	Depends on what you mean by Classic rock.  Like the song that came out a couple of years ago said, when did Motley Crue become classic rock?<br>  I love bands that my older siblings listened to, such as Deep Purple, Hendrix, the Doors, ect.  They all sound great even to this day.  When I was coming of age, there were a few good bands such as the Ramones, Sex Pistols, INXS,, etc, but what got played the most was Madonna and Wham!.<br>  Classic Rap is great.  The Sugar Hill Gang still rules.|`|QstEk6PZaa	Yes! Because the bands had to actually play the songs all the way through in the recording (usually it was a live recording). No studio cheating.

ff8EC0yPaa	if you wish to fulfill dreams like this the best way is to go through clubs such as 'stagecoach' even though you believe your a good dancer and singer and actor, the best way is to join one of these, and get noticed by scouters, and people that would be keen to take you on. Because in things such as stagecoach they put on productions which can make a name for you, - and believe it or not, thats how miley cyrus partly became famous! so good luck and check out websites such as  <a href="http://www.stagecoach.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stagecoach.co.uk/</a><br>  hope i could have helped you.

bdttDnlwaa	I would think that there is a very serious thinking business taking place here. <br>  <br>  A little unforgiving because it aims very high.<br>  It has strenght due to life's hard knocks.<br>  It has realistic expectations.<br>  It expresses Power.<br>  It accepts no-nonsense. <br>  It has the "Master stroke".<br>  <br>  It is profound, insightful, strategic, investigative, with a penetrating mind. Sharp and subtle.<br>  <br>  It is mentally cautious.<br>  It has a strong capacity for concentration and focus. Probably working from Home.<br>  It is canny voire suspicious.<br>  It likes to know about secrets and intrigues.<br>  It likes behind the scenes serious affairs.<br>  <br>  It is unshockable and socially aware.<br>  It has a decidely detached outlook and an out of the ordinary air.<br>  <br>  Take care.

hJP9y6kjaa	An amp will have a set number of gain stages... in other words, it will have a maximum amount of gain/clipping that it can achieve.<br>  <br>  Do you have a gain knob? If you don't, then the amp is presumably relatively low-gain, which means it won't enough bawlz to get a metal distortion.<br>  <br>  If it does, you would put the gain somewhere around 75%, the bass slightly above halfway, the mids between 25-50%, the treble around 75%, and the volume to whatever level works best for you.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't, well... in that case you need a distortion pedal. A "metal" distortion pedal, to be precise.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions are the Boss Metal Zone, Boss Metalcore, ElectroHarmonix Metal Muff, etc. Even cheaper pedals like Danelectro Fab Tone etc can be pretty metal... I would suggest investing in an EQ pedal, as that will give you the most control over your tone and how its voiced - when you start talking high-gain, then EQ after your distortion can provide a wide array of tones for you, so you can dial in a sound that works best for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|YJ7nTdwdaa	well you can't change the distortion with any of those check to see if you have a gain or overdrive button and sometimes if you have a bad amp higher volume = more distortion

I KNOW what episode you are talking about, and cu'z I was so intrigued, I decided to search for you (well, both of us) for the title of this episode & the song featured in the clip. Believe it of not, I have been at it for well over an hour. WITH NO LUCK!! My eyes are burning!<br>  I found a page, using the word "animation" for HOUSE M.D. but it is so long and involved, that I just could not,"see" in order to find it. The peepers were failing me.<br>  <br>  So, what I have for you, cu'z maybe with fresh eyes, you can find it, is provided  you with 2 links.<br>  <br>  One is simply an episode guide to House. The 2nd is the sight in which animation for House should be found.<br>  <br>  I AM sorry I couldn't do more for you. This just might be why haven't-yet recv'd an answer. Cu'z this is a toughy. The 1st time I haven't been able to find something for a member.

pBnO8rDcaa	Everyone knew from the beginning that Miley was no Mariah Carey...but you cant compare Miley to a song writing savant like Taylor Swift..It's pretty obvious Taylor is an amazing singer or she wouldn't be as popular as she is ( = IMO Miley does pretty well for a disney star, actually i think her voice sounds better in her newer songs for this season of Hannah Montana..Just' my opinion.|`|UFvn0kZ2aa	YES!

She also mostly lip syncs, despite the fact that she doesn't have asthma, breathing problems, or hard dancing, and probably doesn't even do any kind of dancing other than "rah-rah" cheerleading. Okay, so, anyways, since she lip syncs, she never really had much practice with singing live and therefore doesn't sing well live.|`|14c1c86403845fd6fab583a14b344e82aa	miley does not have a good voice<br>  to be honest with you i think she cant sing at all even though i like some of her songs. her voice tends to be annoying. i always thought she could not sing but one day on new years ever when she performed with the jonas brothers (we got the party) thats when i truly realize she sucked. she was too loud. her voice was so loud that you could not hear the jobros. and i think she was trying to show of and hit high notes and it just sounded like a car crashing. sorry but thats what i hear when i hear her sing live. in her cd is a little better but still annoying|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	i think your question should be "do you think miley cyrus sings bad ALWAYS"<br>  <br>  because then the answer would be yes. i hate that girl.<br>  the only reason i watched hannah montana was cuz of oliver. sighhh<3|`|ixmaM395aa	I think Slimey Cyrus sings bad, acts bad, looks bad, talks bad.... she is just plain old bad in general! <br>  <br>  Time to retire, get knocked up & live her hick life on welfare.|`|BEfhBLb9aa	her voice sucks sounds like she sick all the time|`|SZZkfVzbaa	She has a strong voice, but she needs to focus on her pitch; it's a little off.<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	SHE STINKS|`|rTHCinWHaa	i didnt think she could sing at the start

I'm pretty sure there is no God but if I were to believe, it would only be as some sort of creator of the universe. (Not like he created people, but the universe that led to evolution and stuff). And I'm pretty sure he wouldn't act like the Gods from the religious books.|`|IiB6nXn5aa	Of coarse all this just didn't happen by accidents. You have to be stupid to think that.|`|MtANnIlfaa	any type of higher being|`|rqTsfzVvaa	Yes, the Big Bang gives logical reason to how the Earth and such were created, but if you look at science even science finds flaws within the physical possibility of everything occuring the way it did. There is a theory called the Theory of Intelligent Design. If you are against that theory but seem to agree with everything else... where did matter come from? According to science, it cannot be created or destroyed... and if you don't believe so, then you should go talk to your government about how you can make something from nothing.|`|c5b60ac3242a47478e9f3294c17cf65faa	Creation forms when energy bits (quarks) explode<br>  and interface with invisible forces we know as Laws<br>  Of Physics.<br>  <br>  The energy is not The Force, and the laws of physics<br>  are a form of energy.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note that the Higgs Boson<br>  was never found, and Darwins evolution theory hit the<br>  trash can sometime last month.<br>  <br>  With the advent of Quantum Mechanics, we now know<br>  that time and space are not constants, but merely<br>  by-products of creation.

I believe that God created this world and everything in it.  Everything needed to sustain life has been provided.  He also gave man intelligence to figure things out like how his universe works.

jlbMKE1vaa	well in our charts we may have other signs in signs, for example, you venus(love sign) may be in aries or saggitarius making you attracted to leos! but on the surface here, perhaps your just attracted to their playful nature, energy and honesty :)<br>  <br>  because a saggitarius is cool because you are very fun, adventerus, kind and you ahve a great sense of humour. i love saggis :)|`|AA11612672	Leos, Saggitarius and Aries are all fire signs.

You are good natured, irrepressible sense of fun and an inspiring spiritual side. The Sagittarius carries the sense of being in a state of divine grace, at one with the universe. In unfavorable situations, you are impatient, have the fear of responsibility, self-indulgent, fanaticism and refuse to grow up. You also have the tendency to get addicted to gambling. Those born under this sign are characterized by optimism, aspiration, inspiration, enthusiasm and expansiveness.<br>  <br>  A Sagittarius has a positive outlook on life, are full of enterprise, energy, versatility, adventurousness and eagerness to extend the experience as much as possible. You enjoy traveling and exploration. You are honorable, honest, trustworthy, truthful, generous and sincere with a passion of justice. Sagittarius not a diplomatic sign like Libra and Scorpio, Sagittarius likes to tell people more than they may want to know, or are ready to hear. Like the other fire signs, Sagittarius enjoys the outdoors. You are usually modest and are often religious with a strong sense of morality. You are strong-willed and good at organizing, a combination that gives you the ability to bring any project to a successful conclusion.<br>  <br>  Star Stone for Sagittarius<br>  <br>  The Star stone for Sagittarius is the Topaz. Topaz comes in many colors and is a member of the quartz group. It aids in bringing forth your leadership qualities and enables you to grasp control of any situation you confront in life. Topaz makes you feel more in control of yourself or the situations you encounter and helps you deal with them in a competent fashion. It helps you take the lead and handle things in a competent fashion. Tradition has it that Topaz helped foretell the future, enhance sexual energy, and promote harmony. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius Ruling Planet<br>  <br>  Jupiter rules the zodiac sign of Sagittarius, so anyone whose birth chart has a strong Sagittarius influence will tend to be expansive, pleasure-loving, benevolent, and have a strong sense of justice. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is related symbolically to optimism, a love of freedom, new experiences, generosity, and expansiveness. In astrology, Jupiter is the planet of beneficence. Psychologically, Jupiter is linked with wisdom and is the guide of the psyche.<br>  <br>  To be added in Pisces: Jupiter is associated with the sign of Sagittarius and once it was also associated with Pisces, It can make its children overly-optimistic, self indulgent and conceited.<br>  <br>  <br>  -------<br>  I knew two sags growing up. I don't know how common it is? But I hope that answers the 2nd part of your question.|`|9wSjCIsTaa	sagg's are my favorite!<br>  i have soo many family members (inc. my father) and friends who are!|`|1PdUecpYaa	i know a couple of sagittarius. i think aquarius is quite rare. i only know 3 aquarians. they're pretty awesome. we get along quite well. <br>  sagittarius are awesome. maybe i'm being biased because i fell hard for a sagittarius guy once. he stands out from the crowd but he's not an attention seeker. he does and say whatever he wants. he doesn't care what people think of him. i think that's so very adorable. and he's a bit philosophical too. i feel like i could learn something from him. <br>  sagittarius are awesome!|`|eURLdGiZaa	im a sagittarius too actually! we're supposed to be rlly strong and always have the last words, but idk if it's right but i heard the stars that make up the constellation were like floating apart a couple of years ago|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Whether or not you believe in astrology, how could any sign be less common than any other, when people seem to get born at the same rate regardless of what time of year it is?|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	they're everywhere. a lot of people are born on nov and dec because their parents made them on valentines day.|`|A8NBQR3iaa	im a sag too!!<br>  Yay!!<br>  Well... we are meant to be really pretty and kind!|`|VsmO0prvaa	Sagittarius is not the least common sign.  In Europe and the United States, the most common birth months are between March to September.  As the season gets colder the births start decline.  In the US, February has the least amount of births.  Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries are the least common signs.<br>  <br>  What makes Sagittarius cool and pop out? Well Sagittarians are all about having fun.  They're optimistic, fun loving, carefree, and the center of attention(Common with Fire Signs).  Unlike the other fire signs, they kinda just go with the wind and don't really step on anyones toes.  You can sum a Sagittarius personality as, "I'm living my life to the fullest, don't poop my party." <br>  <br>  If it's fun people and fun situations, Sagittarius is a ton of fun.  When it's the complete opposite of fun, Sagittarians just tend to look some what lost, and out of place. Even thou they maybe bad at work, and responability, they're one of the best friends to have.|`|hN3k3ggSaa	I would have to say that Sagittarius is my favourite star sign! I have 5 alone in my family! I am a Taurus and on a romantic level Sag is probably one of my worst matches, as I tend to smother my lovers a bit and Sag will not tolerate this. They are free spirited and need lots of room to run. Once they tire of their freedom they come home like loyal puppies. I love their innate optimism, their constant willingness to help in any given situation. I love that they are brutally honest, because once I have finished licking the wounds of their verbal onslaught, I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that what they FORCED ME TO LOOK AT was the absolute, unadulterated truth. Their spiritual wisdom is amazing, and they are often handsome/ beautiful beyond belief. If I wasn't so needy I'd marry one! Many of my TRUE friends have been Sagittarians. Be proud!|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	No i know alot of people with this sign. My fiance is a sag. and i find them energetic and lively

f684db50a43e6b0bb7da4f790e5e7bd2aa	To me she is setting a WORSE example as a role model. She is telling these young girls that look up to her that it is ok to go back to an abusive relationship. Granted what he "allegedly" did was also wrong, she should have been the one to come out on top and instead she is allowing his behavior.

Similarly, all addictive drugs trigger dopamine (the "craving neurochemical") to stimulate the pleasure/reward center. So do gambling, shopping, overeating and other, seemingly unrelated, activities. Go shopping: dopamine. Smoke a cigarette: dopamine. Computer games: dopamine. Heroin: dopamine. Orgasm: dopamine. They all work somewhat differently on the brain, but all raise your dopamine.<br>  You get a bigger blast of dopamine eating high-calorie, high-fat foods than eating low-calorie vegetables. You may believe that you love ice cream, but you really love your blast of dopamine. You're genetically programmed to seek out high-calorie foods over others.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Well,  I don't go jogging twice a day for fun, ya know. I do it so I won't get FAT.

gjXiMdLXaa	i definitely agree. <br>  <br>  First off for those comic nerds out there, this was supposed to be a movie not a comic book. it is not an extension of the the graphic novel it was based on. it is a MOVIE and as  a movie it SUCKED! it lacked good cinematography & the screenplay was poorly written, <br>  <br>  it was LONG and they made boring, mindless, generic, over the top violence, with mediocre at best choreography the focal point of every scene, and put as little focus as possible on anything that would resemble an interesting or engaging story!<br>  <br>  the acting (although bad) wasn't as bad as the character development and character presentation/introduction by the director(Zack Snyder), writer and editor. <br>  <br>  ever other scene was fully loaded with annoying segments and soundbits from different famous songs that kept starting up and stopping 20-30 seconds later!<br>  <br>  Every character was badly acted saved for Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach & Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman. so i have no idea how anyone can think they did a good job with the characters. the most ironic thing is that Jackie Earle Haley just came back to acting in 2006 after not having done a movie since Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence in 1993! his performance was the best of all and it was just good, not great. <br>  <br>  Which brings me to my next point; Billy Crudup, who in my opinion is a very good actor, did a very good job acting in this movie as i would expect him to. This only makes it all the more ironic that i couldn't care less about the boring, useless, monotonic & badly represented character he was given. i seriously couldn't give a **** if i tried so i cant blame the other actors for not being able to show emotion for him.<br>    <br>  And whats with all the unfinished graphics & bad editing. Why does some of the CG look like it was done 20 years ago and the rest looks amazing? <br>  <br>  Same with the wardrobe inconsistencies. at times the outfits looked really good and at others it was like they were at a costume party and it doesn't fit right.Then at other times (Ohh... wait ALL THE TIME) Dr. Manhattan walked all over the screen with his small, floppy, blue, flaccid, dick swinging all over the place.<br>  <br>  i give this movie 2 blue balls way down! :'-(|`|7fEVNng5aa	I couldn't disagree more. Every major character was portrayed perfectly, IMO.|`|11dGXLchaa	Terrible film.    Complete piece of s-hit.|`|K4d6PU10aa	agree i was getting frustrated that the movie didn't end i was sooo bored!|`|TCehI17kaa	I barely ever go to movies now anyway so it won't affect me any Lol!|`|J7Tw6Tcraa	Hell yeah!|`|AA11118472	totally agree.like what the hell,i have waited 2 years 4 dis, they could market this disaster as  form of sleep aide.d naked blue guy, I kept laughing every time i saw him, his undies were even funnier....d only thing i enjoyed was d fact dat d nite owl was cute|`|DXtyMRLuaa	I think it was amazing. Alot better then I expected. It reminded me more of a Sin City type movie then a Batman/ Spiderman type.|`|c1OPub6Xaa	hated night owl ll , thought Dr. Manhattan sounded wimpy, Comedian seemed melancholy t times. I'll give korsbach credit but his character could have been way better|`|bwk2cXQ3aa	I thought it was going to be good but it really sucked. The graphics were cool but the graphic novel didn't transfer well to a movie in terms of plot. Some parts seemed like they were supposed to be funny but they weren't and if they weren't meant to be funny, then what the heck were they thinking? Hugely disappointing.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	It didn't suck entirely... it was VERY faithful to the graphic novel.  But compared to recent masterpieces like the Dark Knight, Iron Man, Lord of the Rings etc where the actors were absolutely superb in their roles- here, some of them were just mediocre.  Night Owl was actually pretty darned good, in addition to Rorshach.<br>  <br>  That graphics were actually good overall, there were just some effects that didn't work.|`|EKM9AKc2aa	Rorschach was the best|`|Ec7836mGaa	i agree completely|`|OUtcHIm0aa	YOU ****** SUCK YA *****!|`|k57Kvgn8aa	YOU suck!|`|rhiCKlpOaa	I agree. The movie was one of the worst I've seen this year. Although the visuals, gore, and the action scenes were spectacular, the overall story was very shallow. The acting was also very cheesy and predictable. It reminded me of Smallville. <br>  <br>  Watchmen's story also lacked focus because they crammed all the stories of the different characters and a bunch of other things in the film. I especially hated how they kept switching back and forth between past and present time. I found it confusing and irritating because it made it difficult to follow the story.|`|Zg7oCdtXaa	Well we saw it on I-MAX,...and it SUCKED BIG BLUE BALLS!...Jesus every other scene you ahve an I-MAX blue dong,.. and people started doing counts in the row in front of us,..and a dude yelled out bout halfway through the movie "Somebody put some pants on dis mutha fucka ..PLEASE!!!" ..lol i think only bout 1/3 of the people liked it, everyone else was laughing, and thought it was a joke.|`|KyShUk8kaa	Agreed.

Though the action scenes were pretty good.|`|C3RYLngTaa	BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE<br>  Go watch Hannah Montana if you you don't like it you pansies|`|yO2bhxzhaa	anyone who dosen't like the watchmen dosent have a good insite into film and only likes movies like die hard etc|`|FhtlD8gNaa	I disagree. you swallow.|`|8ff45c0998366633e2e690fcdcdf5a92aa	I soooo agree.....I read all the other comments, and i was cracking up specially with all the valid points the other answerers brought up.....I just came back from watching the movie, and I don't mind sitting for 3 hours watching a movie, as long as the movie is good and worth it, but this one sucked at keeping my attention for that long......i think the only reason it kept my attention was because I expected the movie to get to the real good part, but it never seemed to come...or maybe it was because I was curious to see where the songs off of the soundtrack would be in the movie...<br>  <br>  I tried to keep in mind that I was watching a movie based on a graphic novel, but the geeky obsession with blood, violence, nudity, and sex was annoyingly absurd........I tried hard not to laugh at some of the superheros' costumes and at the sucky acting, specially coming from the Laurie/Silk Spectre girl, who probably got hired because of her facileness at doing sex scenes like in the Heartbreak Kid rather than for her "acting" skills.........but, getting past the annoying voice thing, I found Rorschach to be the most interesting one in the entire movie....I did understand the complexity of the movie, and the darkness that they attempted to portray, but this was all often overshadowed by the crappier aspects of the film<br>  <br>  ..perhaps I would have found the movie a bit more interesting if i had read the comics...and I understand that people like it for staying at least mostly true to the comic books, but for it to be a good movie it takes so much more than that...<br>  <br>  the movie was so hyped up, and I was expecting/hoping that it would live up to that, but I guess not....|`|rvMWXJSMaa	It was horrible.|`|XNa4S3ojaa	Yea it sucked hairy cow ball !!!!!!|`|3beddc7a6066da65201291d4e65045ffaa	The good was balanced out with the bad. The Rorshach scenes alone were just amazing, I wish they made a movie on him alone. The visuals were beautiful, but the rest of the film was pretty odd and weird. The music they chose in some scenes, specifically the sex scene was just dumb as hell. I didn't care for any of the characters except Rorscach. It was a very mediocre movie that dragged on for way too long. I think it would have been better to rent it.|`|FlSLNhsoaa	disagree, i loved it your crazy|`|0wAZQdvyaa	lol im going to see it in like an hour|`|AA10427496	I thought this movie was a letdown too, but I never read the original Watchmen graphic novel/comic book.<br>  <br>  Apparently, the movie is rather faithful to the original source material (which in itself caused grief for some moviegoers/critics).<br>  <br>  The problem is, the studios promoted this movie the 'wrong' way.  By 'wrong' I mean that they in a way misled the majority of American moviegoers who have never touched this comic at all.  The studios were promoting this like a standard comic book action flick filled with superhero fighting villains in awesome CGI sequences.  They were also trying to tie in the fact that it's the same director as '300' and we all know that movie gave audiences what they wanted.<br>  <br>  So a lot of people went into this movie with totally unrealistic expectations and came away disappointed.  This is less standard popcorn fare (as it was promoted) and more character driven like the comic book.  So for those who have not seen this, don't expect another spiderman type of movie or you will be very disappointed.|`|4Q58l28aaa	The acting, besides the comedian and Rorschach, who pretty much just plays a very angry lunatic, IMO not too tough of a role, was horrible.<br>  <br>  The main girl, forgot her name, was some of the worst acting I've seen in a while.<br>  <br>  To me it seams that all the people who read the book liked it becuase it just stuck to it, but the thing was is that all the people who havn't read it didn't like it which is how you know it sucked.|`|C0z8Flnvaa	watchmen sucked it was a horrible movie it wasted my time and my money the movie was sooooo boring that i fell asleep and my friends and i left the theater but then we came back and it was the same boring blah blah blah scenes...watchmen sucks|`|S2UDCCzoaa	I think the movie was amazing. Although I have never read the book and I can see that there is a lot that seems to be missing. It seems that reading the book would alleviate this. But talking with someone who has read the book they said the movie sounds just like it.<br>  <br>  I thought the movie was very good, it's just the style that you don't like. It was very different, but very good in my opinion. Rorschach gave you all of those "yea! Kickass!" moments while holding the subtle story together as it explained the lives of the watchmen. As far as I know that is what it was supposed to do and it did it with such elegance that I cannot help but love the movie.<br>  <br>  This movie will fail though because the general public is, and always will be, stupid.|`|wZ6OsEl4aa	I saw the commercials for it and said "Oh man those commercials look stupid, but it's a super hero movie so It'll be great anyway!"<br>  I spent 30$ on this movie and I am not happy.<br>  I want double my money back. And I want double my time back.|`|Zthklr5Iaa	Ok obviously the people that say they liked it are the minority. If you are in the minority you are most likely wrong because people like me who have good tastes and every critic in america thought it sucked. Im not going to judge the comic book but the movie sucked. It dragged way to much. They did a terrible job developing characters. I could care less about any of them. They gave them absolutely NO DEPTH AT ALL!! Also for a superhero movie....NO action at all!! What is up with that?? I did not want to sit through a 3 hour movie to see almost no action and dumb filler scenes about characters I had no interest in. Awful movie. First movie Ive seen in a long time where I couldn't wait for it to be over.|`|ZMU6Vvbraa	I just saw it with my girlfriend last night. She hated the movie so much that she broke up with me for making her watch it. I hated it too! I wasted 3 hours of my life. Plus, my girlfriend Brianna Love left me.|`|11Z7XiyJaa	I'll be honest here,<br>  I'm 15 years old, never read the comic before.<br>  <br>  Now i thought the plot of the movie and the way it unraveled to the end was great, I thought it was genius. Especially how they reveal that Adrian sent those nuclear bombs in order for the Soviet Union and the U.S. to come together (At least, that's how I saw it. I might be wrong, don't kill me.) The movie is deep, and only people who appreciate meaningful movies and don't really care about the whole kicking *** action scenes would like this movie. Obviously, people who are into action movies would hate this movie.<br>  <br>  Now, I do agree that Watchmen was realllllyyyyyyy boring. Yes, I've read that the movie stayed really faithful to the movies but it could have seriously used some more spicing up because it was too dull and boring. The movie stretched out to close to 3 hours, with ONLY about 4, or 5 fighting scenes, and those didn't last long either. I loved the plot of the movie and everything, and I favor it on that, but the fact that it's really boring makes the movie unappealing to me, and as you can see, countless others.<br>  <br>  I get that the movie is supposed to be different from other superhero movies. I also understand that Watchmen is supposed to be darker and have a more realistic view, but I think that they could have made it less boring and dull.<br>  <br>  Does anyone agree with me?|`|lSQiNz3raa	Agree Entirely....Sucked Bad !!!  Took way too long to tell the story.  While it was true to the story it was not told very well.  Maybe not a bad video rental but even at that it is at least a good hour too long.|`|9zP1eZR6aa	Terrible.<br>  <br>  And yes, I -GOT- it. <br>  <br>  Malin Akerman, as Laurie/SIlk Spectre, totally ruined the movie for me and everyone in the theater. Her sub-soap opera level acting destroyed every scene she was in and caused unintentional laughter when the movie was supposed to be serious. The dramatic climax of the movie fell totally flat because of her.<br>  <br>  The fact that Zack Synder didn't fire her after the first day of filming proves to me that the guy has no critical facilities for directing actors.|`|ZtljWY2daa	I completely disagree. I found this movie very good. You can't go into this film expecting a simple here is the good guy here is the bad guy watch them fight plot. This is a film with no identifiable good guys. All are very messed up characters. I liked all the casting except Ozymandias, he was too dweeby. To the people complaining about Dr. Manhattan's penis, seriously? Grow up. It is 2009. Also, again, it is a film true to the comic, in the book, you see penis, really not a big deal. This movie is not one for someone who just wants some stupid super powered fighting, this is a film with a real story. For the love of god, stop calling them "The Watchmen" they are not a super hero fighting team like the X-men! So, all in all, I found this movie great, good story, good actors, good acting, and a good choice to replace the giant squid. Those who bash, you don't know your ****. God ignorance is annoying as hell.|`|99749eeWaa	Having never read nor cared to read the comic book...I do agree the movie was horrible. But it was entertaining how bad it was...just like 300.<br>  <br>  Rorschach looked more like a cuttlefish than an inkblot test and did the same annoying low raspy voice thing that ruined The Dark Knight for me- its too forced an unnatural to be taken seriously. <br>  <br>  The stupid Walmart low prices logo is the watchmen badge? Are you kidding me? Again regardless of what the comic book uses-the director should have been aware the connection that would be made by using the same stupid face and opted to change it. I felt like I was watching a walmart commercial when I saw it.  <br>  <br>  The special effects were unnecessarily gory, cheesy, and gratuitous. IE the Rorschach that was created when Rorschach was imploded...I felt like I was insulted with that. <br>  <br>  They cast every female role with a bimbo who couldn't act. Oh wait, every role was cast with someone who couldn't act except Dr Manhattan who just didnt act. <br>  <br>  Regardless of what comic book came out when, Xmen the movie already did everything this movie aimed for, why reinvent the wheel? <br>  <br>  Movie makers, please stop making comic book movies-they suck.|`|2vWdI3Kyaa	The movie "Watchman" attracted a great deal of attention along with very high hopes, yet in actuality it was rather.. disapointing. The story line was rather dull, graphics seemed to alternate between good and bad; overall the movie, in comparison to other well anticipated movies, was a flop. Essentialy the movie did "Suck", Quite bad at that.<br>   - Alaa|`|O7e6sVcqaa	I completely agree it sucked. I felt like I was watching a cheep and silly version of Batman. And really, what is up with the costumes? It was like watching The Incredibles...but without the delight. They hyped this movie to the limit. They advertised it everywhere. And I was extremely disappointed<br>  <br>  I had a hard time following the story line. Coming into the movie, I had no idea how long it would be. About 40 minutes into the movie, I got on the web on my phone to find out how long it was. It told me it was 2 hours and 43 minutes. Soon after that, I felt I was watching the time on my phone, more than the movie itself.<br>  <br>   I found the opening scene rather very good. But that may be the only great scene in the film. Just when you think the story line will pick up and some action starts, it falls right back down. The gore was completely unnecessary. I had a hard time watching bones get ripped out of flesh and a head getting cut and stabbed at about 10 times. <br>  <br>  I left the movie just about when Mr. Blue Balls and his whore were leaving Mars. Mars?!<br>  <br>  I'm telling you all, dont waste your time and your 10-15 dollars.|`|9B87daVpaa	Agree. Sucked on so many levels. <br>  <br>  Interesting story?...none.<br>  Believable characters?...no<br>  Interesting characters?...no<br>  Violence without purpose?...yes<br>  Irritating go-nowhere plot? ..yes<br>  Blue penis every 3 minutes?...yes<br>  Things that didn't make sense?...many<br>  Good acting?...hell no<br>  <br>  Oh, but I guess as long as it was true to the original, that makes it ok that it was a complete failure as a movie. I hate mindless action movies. But even that would have been better than this crap.|`|Y2WGfnrvaa	WATCHMEN SUCKED|`|5nQ5PfxFaa	There was too much man-butt in the movie. Dr. Manhattan is nothing more than a huge blue phallic symbol. And the batman rip-off... what was his name? Watching a little batman rip-off compete over a chick with a giant blue omnipotent penis was funny. But that's about it.<br>  <br>  The movie's best character was Rorschach but the gigantic blue penis destroyed him in a quantum ejaculation.|`|7VWgIncYaa	Rorschach was friggin' AWESOME. The best out of all 'em!<br>  Movie sucked big, hairy ones, though.|`|kAIiXp1uaa	WOW - this movie TOTALLY sucked . . . but I was determined to make it through to the end - now I wish I had those 2 1/2 hours of my life back!<br>  <br>  As for the characters - you are totally correct!<br>  although, I liked the actor playing "Rorschach" better as Kelly Leak - the cool kid with the Harley Davidson from the original 'Bad News Bears' movies!<br>  <br>  Can the Watchmen send me a refund????|`|oiiha0Qaaa	HORRIBLE movie!  I walked out, otherwise I would have fallen asleep.|`|KUgSDRsDaa	I believe this is what a graphic novel would look like if they made every graphic novel as true as its original content, very long drawn out dry scenes where nothing happens. I didn't need to see all the back stories of all the characters. Not all the while they are teetering on the brink of nuclear annihilation. The problem with this movie wasn't that it had a bad story because I think the story could have been great. The problem was it had to much story or wanted to explain to much story. ex. WTF was the point of showing comedian killing the pregnant mom? to show us the doc was inhuman? to show us comedian deserved to die? that whole scene imo could have been left out.<br>  <br>  TLDR: This movie sucked because it tried to hard to be a graphic novel.|`|CD9FdwW2aa	Indeed this movie just plain stank! I've sat through long movies before, but they were actually good movies. This movie is long and doesnt flow at all. It is extremely boring and and has no point. For those who keep referring to the book and saying that we just dont "get it"...This is a MOVIE!!!! People don't make movies in hopes that only those that read the book see and like it! Thats how you fail! I've seen plenty movies and not read the book prior...and liked them. Some even made me want to read the book. This movie however, doesn't make me want to do anything but warn people. This movie SUCKED!! Characters were uninteresting, Mr. Blue Man bored me to tears, gratuitious EVERYTHING! Complete waste of money.|`|mBlnTbFVaa	You are just a hater! You are just mad because you suck! I am sick of everyone saying that "The Watchmen" movie sucked! You all need to get your heads re-examined...its a ******* movie dam..get over it. I read the novel and saw the movie and it was great...yeah a few things changed but I believe that it was still a great movie. Don't try to ruin it for people that enjoyed the movie...why don't you go watch "Batman" or something that entertains your peanut size brain!|`|Z33sPUbKaa	why would u even see it?? the commercials looked LAAAAAAAAAME|`|JMdOxLYnaa	I totally agree. I spent over 30$ for this movie and it was a total waste! It was slow with hardly any action. Dr. Manhattan was a weirdo, The Comedian was murdering and rapist jerk, Night owl was a pansy, Ozymandias was blonde headed, full himself backstreet boy, the girl was a ho..............Lol.<br>  the only character that was likeable to me was rorschach and it was because he actually had some principles. I took my 14 yr old brother to it and his arm hurt from having to cover up his eyes every ten minutes.<br>  <br>  There's a seen where ozymandias is so smart he's watching multiple televison programs all at once. High up in the corner a lesbian porno was playing on one of the tv screens.<br>  Let's see .... the long sex sex scene between the silk girl and the night owl was just nasty. if someone wants to watch porn they can go rent it at blockbuster or something. Why do we have to watch it at the movies? And Dr. Manhattan needed to put some freaking clothes one! i got so tired of seeing his  blue stuff hanging out all over  the IMAX screen for almost three hours. A total waste of money and please people ........... DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS!!!!!|`|vWg5EgR1aa	Dude...the movie was aimed solely off of the graphic novel. It wasn't a bang, bang type of movie like Batman or Hulk of recent. My personal opinion is they should have targeted the movie to a completely different audience. I thought it was a superb movie and stuck on target with the novel.|`|pmzXLODRaa	This movie truly sucked some big dick, and by that it could be blue dick for all i know. This was a waste of money and time, and im pissed i gave this film my $12 at my overpriced theatre to see this piece of crap. Their were retarded sex scenes of the silk spectre or whatever, who first was sleeping with the blue guy, than sleeps with the batman like at the same night cause she is a ho =D, and than decides to do it again on the machine like at the same night. They had a akward obsession to show actors with no integrity, rorshack or however you spelt his name, was the only badass character, but had the annoying batman voice to go with it. Half the **** i couldn't even believe, example, action scene of the bat guy and the chick who have no super powers, just go through 50 prisoners who are in there for murder and are 5 times the mass of them, all died to them as if it were nothing, nixon looked like a joke, don't care if it was done on purpose, cause that made me think of the whole movie as a joke personally.  If this movie was supposed to be over the top, than it should of had a lot more action scenes and a lot less stupid ****, like saying RORSHACKS JOURNAL TODAY I SAW SOME PEOPLE WALK FROM A DINER, THEY DIDNT NOTICE ME CAUSE I DIDNT HAVE MY MASK ON KK THNX BAI. NOV 12 1974. The movie had a horrible *** ending, which it ended with a whole city of innocent people dying by a bomb, and their like ITS OK I BROUGHT WORLD PEACE KK. The actors overall sucked balls, and overall even if this was based for the comic book fans, this movie sucked. I don't care what ou all say.|`|NtWslbpraa	Yes. I totally agree. Watchmen was a waste of time and money. A 3 Hour movie of nothing but talking and maybe like 4 action scenes. The commercial pointed out those 4 best parts and everything else was just filler crap that no one cared about.|`|WXXndnZSaa	Save yourself the time and frustration.. the movie is as long as it is boring. THe plot is as nonexistant as a porn and even with the hour+ of flashbacks the movie explained litle to nothing about what was going on. Go see race to Witch Mountain... God it's sad that I can even say that.|`|v2yQI1ZMaa	that movie sucked so much|`|dcb6c334c7fc5a6cf8916858641508afaa	The Comedian...is your father.<br>  Horrible Movie.<br>  <br>  Plus who wants to see a blue penis for 2 hours and 45 minutes?<br>  The only thing that would have made the movie better was if you got to see the guys dong when he was 100 feet tall. Now that would have added much needed humor.|`|eI1TDNwBaa	DO NOT WANT.<br>  Orgy of needless violence and darkness.<br>  Wish I could get the three hours back. :(<br>  <br>  And if you take little kids, like some fing moron at the theater I was at, you should be publicly whipped and thrown in jail, and I am not joking.|`|osbCpzKFaa	I would have to agree here.  I was bored to tears after a decent start to the movie.  I wouldn't see it.  Wait for DVD.<br>  <br>  In terms of Superhero movies, this ranks right up there with the Fantastic Four movies; and that is not a good thing.

5PIgZ7tFaa	Yep. But the government didn't like people getting high on life - or anything else; so that went down the drain. For some stuff on just how tight-a**ed some people were in those days Google censorship, there's stuff that was made illegal that seems laughable these days.<br>       Coca is the plant that cocaine is derived from. Nowadays they just put a whack of caffeine in Coke and Pepsi and Mountain Dew. They just switched the drug that they add, to make it legal. <br>       Of course, they tried to ban alcohol too - that didn't work out so well. It's too easy to make. Google "bathtub gin."|`|J2gBU0NDaa	yes I knew that. Did you also know coke was a cough, and upset stomach medicine, when it first came out.

I actually liked his 2nd CD better than his first.  That CD had beats from Timbaland, Lil Jon, Mannie Fresh, Kanye West, himself, and others.<br>  <br>  He should probably stay away from rap music now tho....or maybe he could join with Cash Money and completely turn into trash|`|B0y9aO1Laa	Don't really miss him or hate him.

xaotgFvEaa	Usually go between 11 and 12, go for a good time but it's a bonus if I go home with someone! Club shuts at 2am and had casual relationships with people and remained friends|`|CtUVT49Gaa	Around an hour after it opens...<br>  <br>  Not always...its usually in the back of my mind though...<br>  <br>  2 half 2...<br>  <br>  Nope...|`|5h0nUQODaa	go out around tenish, just a good time, around 3am and no.|`|Y7aRTePiaa	I like to break in when it's closed, so that's 3PM on a Monday afternoon. After pillaging the quandary of neon-coloured and rather gay-looking alcoholic beverages, I decide that a little entertainment is in order and phone the police, saying there's been a break in at the local club, and a rather attractive police-woman should attend immediately, preferably looking like Polly from The Bill. Upon her arrival, I pretend to be the club-owner, doing the accounts, and shout "we're closed...oh but for you I'll make an exception".<br>  My roledex is now full of wanton female civil servants who love to use hand-cuffs. Very kinky though, normally I have to spend 8 hours in a 5ft by 6ft enclosure, akin to a police cell, while she opens a small hatch in the door and uses very niche role-play words like "your solicitor is on his way". Best relationship I've ever had.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	cluns here close at 230am so I like to get there at 12 or 1230, I only need about an hour and half to be out in heels around drunk people before I am annoyed!<br>  <br>  <br>  I never go hoping to get laid....not a chance!<br>  <br>  No but I know a lot of people in the clubs, guy friends and what not!|`|XPaLYdobaa	i go clubbing quite alot,i feel guilty,i just cant get used to look on them baby seals faces|`|9ZpZxYvqaa	hahahaha... these are like the funniest questions i've ever seen on yahoo answers! anyhoo... for me....<br>  1. usually i'll go to a club at about 10.30pm when the club is quiet, so you could get a few nice seats and warm yourself up a lil with some cocktails and all... wait till the crowd picks up at about 12am or 1am, spice up the night with dances and shots,<br>  2. if you go with the hope and mentality of getting laid, it's obvious and opposite sex somehow senses that from afar and you'll seem desperate. just go there to have a good time, keep your options open and it'll turn out to be a great night whether or not you scored...<br>  3. club that i go usually closes at about 3-4am... depending on how efficient they manage to shoo people out of the club and all...<br>  4. yes i've met someone in the club before. they end up to be fun people to chill with or a great lover for that couple of months rather than a soul partner or a steady relationship... but of course there are lucky people that get proper relationship out of a club, just not me... lol...<br>  <br>  well, this is just a point of view from a girl... hope it helps : )|`|36MfZqUzaa	husband are i are celebrating ten year anniversary after meeting in the arches glasgow!!!!!

2bVxBCgzaa	Simply because he's in a huge band. If he was still in Exodus, NOBODY would care. If Mustaine was still Metallica's guitarist, then he'd be rated where Kirk is (of course, Dave is much better, as well as EVERY other guitarist from Megadeth.) Hell, from the same era, Danny Spitz from Anthrax was better than Kirk.<br>  <br>  Buddy Guy is no big deal IMHO; he's just made a name for himself by duplicating other guy's styles in his show- not that difficult. I've seen him twice, and don't rate him with a lot of other blues player's I've seen- there are a ton of better blues players than him.

Hammet has influenced generations of guitarists. Half the folks you named I've never heard of. Others like Malmsteen while increadibly talented add nothing to any genre. <br>  <br>  Hammett didn't invent the modern Metal style but Metalica popularized it. They were the one group that had lasting success out of a whole wave of Metal groups to emerge in the late 70s early 80s. Most of them faded out before the late 80s. Metalica just got better. <br>  <br>  In any genre there are folks out there who are extremely talented but who also don't have either any songwriting skills and or do a poor job of playing with a band. With Primus for example. Les Claypool can play circles around most bass players. However he hogs the sound so badly that it's not a band, it's Les Claypool and the other guys. No give or take, which is why Primus is a sidenote if that much. Their top hit was a cover. 20 years from now I doubt anybody will know who Claypool was. Geezer Butler on the other hand has influenced generations of bass players including Claypool. <br>  <br>  In short how fast you can play means nothing. The only people who care if your faster, have massive technical difficulty are other musicians usually younger musicians. Al Demoli can run scales at lightning speed, so?  Malmsteen can pull off some increadibly difficult stuff but in the end it is souless. It sounds dead and is one long ego trip. Technique for the sake of technique is to take your gifts and squander them. The whole point of technical expertise is that you can do something melodically for the sake of the song, not write a song to spotlight what you can do technically. That whole shred for the sake of shredding is what killed Metal in the 80s. There are only so many young aspiring guitarists to buy those LPs and go to those shows. The rest of the Rock world turned to Grunge, which as often as not had no guitar solo. If your not only a guitarist but a fairly good one you have no idea just how difficult many shredding techniques are and even if you do, if it don't sound good it don't sound good. All music must pass through that test. Does it sound good? If so it's music. If not it's noise.  <br>  <br>  The spotlight goes to he who writes the best music. You have to listen to a song to appreciate the technical difficulty of it. If the music isn't good then all the talent in the world isn't going to get you known as anything more than a circus freak who does tricks for a living. Music has always been about the passion, the art of it. Betray that and you kill everything your trying to do and most of the shredders lose sight of that essential element of music.|`|AA11464625	I might be wrong but from what I understand his guitar is made of wood with a gloss resin coating. Steal guitars are nice but are not used in rock as much as they where in the 70's and 80's. I am not trying to dispute your question but I thought you might want to get clear on that. As far is being a God is concerned, has he created any planets or maybe a solar system of some kind? Sorry for being so uneducated on this subject but I am trying to get a best answer here and there and thought you might help out.|`|W0Wk89Iaaa	Lets see kirk wrote Master of Puppets did that answer your question?<br>  no, maybe,<br>  creeping death<br>  fade to black<br>  enter sandman<br>  the unforgiven<br>  for whom the bell tolls<br>  so i think that proves it. <br>  but if you wanna know why Kirk is better its because he creates music and its just not about technical skill<br>  for example Hendrix beats Malmsteen which one of them can play their scales faster probably malmsteen. but there is no dispute that Hendrix is better. and that is why Gilmour, kirk, page, hendrix, even pete townsend is better then Herman Li.<br>  Also i called your bullshit on slowing it down it actually sounds worse. because of his limited number of notes he can play that fast he has to stick to cliche scales and arpeggios also he cant make every Riff good because he trys to play to fast.<br>  also i saw them opening for Disturbed and Slipknot theyre not flawless im guessing you dont play guitar and therefore cant tell when they mess up but they do. its just hard to notice cause they play so fast|`|gOflzGW0aa	Kirk is part of the greatest metal band in history.  He, alongside James Hetfield are the reason for their success.  The guitar is why metal lives on.  Ozzy Osbourne's solo career was all for nothing without the legendary guitarists Randy Rhoads and Zakk Wylde.  Try to picture Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page.  Keith Richards created awesome riffs that carried some of The Rolling Stones biggest hits. All of the aforementioned guitarists are the greatest of all time because they played some of the greatest guitar parts in rock and roll history.  The guitar is rock and roll.|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	Hahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahhaha...|`|qJpIh2iiaa	alls i know is he regained his talent with death magnetic<br>  i mean come on,it had to hurt him when couldnt solo on st anger|`|WU4MHq3aaa	Kirk has produced some amazing music with Metallica... I agree he isn't the best.<br>  <br>  Kirk Hammett owns every inch of Li...<br>  <br>  the only people who are metal gods to me are Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden<br>  <br>  besides... Iommi, Dimebag, Rhoads own both<br>  <br>  WHY TDs?|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Well you see my skeptical friend, Kirk is considered a metal god by many, including myself, because the fact of the matter is while Herman Li can play eight minutes of super fast mediocrity well, Young master Kirk can slow it down and make a part that sounds good, and make it so it all does not sound the same. Li is good, and he has the most skill i've seen, but Kirk makes better music. also, Metallica was one of the original innovators of thrash. people will always recognize them.<br>  <br>  I disagree, the center of most Metal music is the guitar. If the guitar is good, people generally like what they hear. It wouldn't be metal otherwise. I like most of the bands u named but i have to say the thing that makes metallica great is good guitar playing.
uLEpOpSMaa	Check out these guys:<br>  <br>  Marty Friedman (very classical oriented)<br>  Jason Becker (same)<br>  Tony MacAlpine (melodic shredding)<br>  Vinnie Moore (same)<br>  Michael Lee Firkins (unique shredding with touches of blues) <br>  Blues Saraceno (used to be popular but washed up now) <br>  John Norum (if you don't think he shreds enough in Europe, listen to his solo career)<br>  Reb Beach (Guitarist from Winger.  Not always straight up shred but he has some major soloing abilities)<br>  Warren DeMartini (RATT guitarist)<br>  <br>  There's lots more!  By the way, I wouldn't consider Eddie Van Halen to be a shredder.  He influenced a lot of that but isn't directly routed in it.  Michael Angelo Batio is very talented because he can transition between mind boggling speed to dramatic bends in his instrumentals.<br>  <br>  By the way, Steve Vai wasn't in Whitesnake for very long.  None of Whitesnake's hits feature Vai on guitar.  They went through a few guitarists and Vai came right at the end of their success period.  If you want to hear Vai from his band days, check out David Lee Roths earlier solo albums.  He plays guitar on all those, and also on the Alice Cooper song "Feed My Frankenstein".|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Vito Bratta (White Lion)<br>  Vivian Campbell (Dio, Whitesnake, Def Leppard)<br>  Warren DeMartini (Ratt)<br>  Jake E.

He can slow down time. Shredding is an obsolete artform in my opinion. There is only so much an artist can do with an arpeggio. Get into some avant garde type stuff. Listen to buckethead. Listen to Frank Zappa. Zappa doesnt shred but he uses so much more imagination in his improv than all of the artists you listed.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt call alexi or randy rhoades shredders also|`|fCF02V87aa	Ive seen many a show--and was fortunate enough to catch Pantera during the Vulgur tour---Dimebag was nothing short of ferocious and I consider him the dDefinitionof a shredder.

I'm fairly nocturnal so the sunset promises me it will soon be dark. I like the dark! I'm also very pale, so the sunrise is my cue to slather on the sunscreen and attempt to avoid the sun all day.

u86NV1Enaa	No, if you're having Instant, your guesses will know.<br>  Instant potatoes mix has a strange flavor and for much butter or anything you add to it, still has it. It's like eating a blend of pure semolina with baking soda, and lots of it.<br>  Do hand made and you'll be the queen of the house. There's nothing better than real potatoes with some Real Butter and some Whole Milk in it. Just delicious!<br>  Don't forget to mash potatoes when they're hot, so it won't go into chunks. Slowly add butter and little milk. Keep mashing and add more milk until it's fluffy and thick.|`|aleWoJufaa	the instant ones seem to have a different texture <br>  <br>  if your guests are used to fancy food, don't use the instant mix. <br>  otherwise I don't think they will notice very much or at least won't mind|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Only Rachel Ray knows.|`|2c4e6005843e2624086af284a2e71120aa	Yes, I can notice the difference. And it's not that hard to make mashed potatoes. Just start boiling the potatoes from cold water, wait a while, test their tenderness with a knife. Then when their soft, drain the water, mash and add milk and butter.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	instant potatoes have a taste thats way off from homemade ones. make them from scratch, ask a friend for help. i cant cook.maybe try rice instead|`|hyqf7xR0aa	yes. the differences are obvious both in texture and flavor.|`|EblQojpEaa	I can tell the difference, cause ive been spoiled by wonderful cooking(my granny) but you might be able to pull it off. i have no advice|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Yes you can tell.  The instant potatoes have a different texture than real potatoes.  To make from scratch mashed potatoes make sure you have at least one good sized potato for each guest.  Peel, then cut the potato in half then cut into medium sized pieces and place in a pot.  Keep them in water as potatoes discolor if they get dried out. When you have peeled and cut all your potatoes, rinse with cold water, then fill pot again until all the pieces are covered, add salt and put on stove top--boil until they are soft but not mushy.  Drain, and mash, add a little milk and butter and stir.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Have you never had both of them??  You can definitely tell the difference and I guarantee they will notice immediately.  If it is a fancy dinner party you will want to make the real deal, unless you want to come across as cheap.  Hell im all for instant potatoes and cheapness lol but for fancy shmancy gig, ya the cat will be outta the bag.  GL|`|IX9znFLAaa	There is a slight difference.  Homemade is very easy to make.  Peel the potatoes, boil until soft.  Mix with a beater while adding milk,  butter, and a bit of salt.  Add these until they taste the way you want them too.  You really cant screw them up.  You can make them the day before, refrigerate, and microwave them the next day.  Good luck!|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Buy Idaho instant. Boil one or two potatoes. When they're soft (stick a fork thru them), pour out the hot water and cover with cold. Drain. Mash. Mix in with the instant taters. They'll never know the difference and they'll taste like homemade and have the right texture.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	I'm no food scientist, but I think handmade mashed potatoes tastes more rich, and instant mashed potatoes can taste a bit more watery.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~|`|AA10345820	Instant mashed potatoes taste like wallpaper paste.|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	I can tell but most times I don't care about that. <br>  <br>  Instant is good enough for me...|`|oLj0VTX5aa	The potatoes from the mix have a different texture and taste.  You can get away with it by either boiling two peeled potatoes until they are soft and mashing them and mixing it in with butter, or you can simply take about 8 potatoes of your choice (I like red potatoes), peel them, cut them up into small peices (about 1-2 inches square), and bring them to a boil with a pinch of salt.  Boil them on medium heat until the potato is soft and breaks easily.  Drain the water and either using a hand mixer or a hand masher, start mashing the potatoes... based on your choice for flavour, you can add some butter, about two table spoons or less, milk, cream cheese or sour cream to make creamier potatoes.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	I like real mashed potatoes they taste better than instant. Instant potatoes  don't  even  have any taste.<br>  <br>  That's my story and I'm sticking to it. ; )|`|4d9935586be55aa85a6c466ef935061faa	hell yea instant potatoes don't have the right flavors and tAste like the box..no matter if you put butter or milk it's straight up nasty|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Make what you can.

As she bends to feel the fine leather upholstery, a loud fart escapes her.Very embarrassed, she looks around nervously to see if anyone has noticed her little accident and hopes a sales person doesn't pop up right now.As she turns, there standing next to her, is a salesman. "Good day, Madame. How may we help you today?"Very uncomfortably she asks, "Sir, what is the price of this lovely vehicle?"He answers, "Madame, it would be prudent <br>  of me not to say.

Here's another "oldie" but goodie for you:<br>  <br>  Harold is 95 and lives in a Senior Citizen Home.  Every night after dinner, Harold goes to a secluded garden behind the Center to sit and ponder his accomplishments and long life.<br>   <br>  One evening, Mildred, age 87, wanders into the garden. They begin to chat and before they know it, several hours have passed.  After a short lull in their conversation, Harold turns to Mildred and asks, "Do you know what I miss most of all?"<br>  <br>  She asks him, "What?"<br>  <br>  "Sex!!" he replies.<br>   <br>  Mildred exclaims, "Why you old fart! You couldn't get it up if I held a gun to your head!"<br>   <br>  "I know," Harold says, "but it would be nice if a woman could just hold it for a while."<br>  <br>  "Well, I can oblige that," says Mildred, who unzips his trousers and removes his manhood. Then, she proceeds to hold it.  Afterward, they agree to meet secretly each night in the garden where they would sit and talk and Mildred would hold Harold's manhood.<br>  <br>  Then one night, Harold didn't show up at their usual meeting place.  Alarmed, Mildred decided to find Harold and make sure he was OK.  She walked around the Senior Citizen Home where she found him sitting by the pool with Ethel, another female resident, who was holding Harold's manhood!<br>  <br>  Furious, Mildred yelled at him, "You two-timing son-of-a-b****! What does Ethel have that I don't have?"<br>   <br>  Old Harold smiled happily and replied, "Parkinson's!"|`|TjWA37kuaa	hahahahahaha I love your joke....thanks 4 making my day..here a * 4U to make your day :)|`|h5p9exIDaa	Hi Mummy,<br>    Funny and I can picture what they were doing...Great Joke..<br>  Your Friend,<br>  poppy1|`|30iqJREVaa	Hehehehehehe lol|`|MQqlcBcFaa	ha ha ha ha...good one LOL|`|AA12050428	Hilarious.!

In my experience, when a school-aged person asks that question there are refering to something derogatory. That comment you are referring to is used to make fun of someone. Depending on your personality I would give you a couple of ideas. Maybe you should ignore the person who made the remark knowing the truth about it being mean. Or maybe you could kindly say something to the person they were referring to. Some people can't help the way they smell. Who knows, you might make a new friend. I would not advise you to directly speak to the person who made the comment because unfortunately they could become violent, even girls.|`|NnDkqau6aa	Well, it depends on if you smelled fish too. You could say, "Yeah, actually, it does smell like fish. That's strange". Or if you didn't, you could laugh and make a friendly joke about her smelling fish...I don't know. What did you actually do? Did you snap at her or something?|`|xlqJGyQiaa	To subtly run away, screaming.

8vGq6cRTaa	Yes - check the websites of your local hit stations often!  And listen to the radio. So far all meet and greets have been sponsored by radio stations and they give away tickets in contests or by picking random callers.

It was the largest Japanese attack since Pearl Harbour, 7 December 1941, and followed a reconnaissance flight on 10 February 1942. On that day there were 27 Allied ships in the harbour and approximately 30 aircraft at the Darwin Civil and RAAF airfields.|`|1DyriukYaa	Yes they did.

AdEJBAkMaa	Yes, but once it comes in contact with oxygen it turns red. Hope this helps =D|`|igI5yX0vaa	In your body blood that isn't oxygenated is blue, blood with oxygen in it is red.|`|9lVjWPGqaa	yes only when its inside of u... yuuup<br>  <br>  <br>  edwardzslady duh<3|`|mfwDnMupaa	Yes. When it's in the veins going back to the heart for oxygen then it turns red again when it get its oxygen fill in the arteries.|`|PFCgRirJaa	Blood with no oxygen is blue, which is why it's always red when you see it.|`|b4twAWp7aa	Yes|`|IjKndeVvaa	Contrary to popular belief, as is evident by the answers you've received, there is both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the body. It doesn't all just turn red when you cut yourself. Some of it is already red. You do have both red and blue blood in your system.|`|YL0DypySaa	I think it's purple, but it looks blue in your veins if you look at the inside's of your wrists because it doesn't have oxygen. =) I'm not sure though. Biology was last year, and I don't remember anything from it! XD|`|xNYUZZvlaa	When it's in your inside it blue, but once it meets oxygen... It turns red(:|`|Tfkjn0Ncaa	its always blue but if you get a cut it turns red because it reacted with oxygen.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	blood is bluish purple before oxygen turns it red.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Nope i dont think so|`|OLcXtWQyaa	not unless you are a horseshoe crab.|`|KGJHXvflaa	In the inside.|`|03TLTj92aa	NO NO IT IS NEVER BLUE!!!!!!!! ok i did a project on it once read this<br>  <br>  wen we breath in air, it goes through the lungs and to the heart. after that the heart uses the oxygen to "feed" the red blood cells. then the red blood cells get pushed around the body until it gets back to the heart. by this time the red blood cells have "fed" the organ it was pushed to and has no more oxygen. the oxygen makes it a bright red colour and wen there is no more oxygen it appears a darker RED it is never blue but in most websites and stuff they use blue for blood with no oxygen to make it easier to distingish the difference between the oxygenated blood|`|9YCmiewRaa	No. Never. Blood in arteries is bright red, in veins darker red (but not blue) because it has less oxygen. And it most definitely doesn't change colour when exposed to air. If blood was blue, that would make your skin, lips, gums etc various shades of pale blue.|`|NsePqNIEaa	Nope.<br>  It only looks blue through the skin.|`|hLswVIG5aa	Oxygen cant turn red, because you have oxygen in your blood, it's is just kind of blueish purplish, but when it comes out changes because of the pressure.... or something like that was what my teacher told me the other day|`|7bNtlih6aa	Yes, it is always blue, that is why our veins are blue! When we get a cut though and oxygen mixes with it, it turns the red color we see.|`|vyz7uICNaa	it's supposed to be blue,but when you cut yourself it looks red because when it is exposed to oxygen it turns red,so technically it's blue|`|LOfZNNdfaa	Yes.  Yes it is.  Do some research and find out why.  Remember Knowledge is power and can take you to new heights.  Ignorance builds upon ignorance and yields stupidity.|`|ihxO8qApaa	the blood that has already went through your body giving the muscles oxygen and picking up CO2 is blue.<br>  <br>  physiology is deathly boring|`|pqzKlNudaa	It is always blue but once it touches the air it turns blue.|`|hSJoFltpaa	when it's inside of you, yes. but once it hits the air, it's red.|`|DcMWH8BSaa	Yes thats why your veins are blue and not red. :)|`|gaVhPGWhaa	my teacher 2 years ago said it was.... i dont believe her|`|NAhEQiXyaa	yeah oxygen turns it red|`|ZsujbEjJaa	never seen it before|`|7PRpRiRNaa	this says a lot about you...

nxymxSUFaa	No, not at all.  If I personally feel that the question has merit I have no problem giving out stars.  I actually give out a great number of stars.  Except for the  trolls who try and mess things up for everyone here, I believe that there is no such thing as a dumb question as long as it's a responsible question.|`|RS3fjNboaa	No, I don't. I try to give out stars to my contacts anyway. It's a great way to give recognition to my contacts. Even if I don't answer the question, I try to star it. It's like saying hi. Sometimes I forget to star, though. I'm only human (even though I look like a big steer).|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Not at all, I'm honored that they want to be my contact. I have no problem with contacts asking, but the majority of them like you, don't even have to. I'm happy to give them.|`|TCehI17kaa	No u don't bother me but i remember a certain pedophile loser by the name of Owner would beg for stars & it would be annoying as hell. Talk about an attention seeking idiot & loser.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Doesn't bother me either way.<br>  <br>  You aren't annoying me. <br>  <br>  Here's a star to help out your cause.  :)|`|BIyJUmM9aa	Noo, your not annoying us.<br>  Besides you star all my questions, so of course I will star yours 2<br>  <br>  :)|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Nah not at all you star my questions when I ask them, so I'll be more than happy to return the favor.|`|uhZ38xYkaa	No, if they asked that more than twice, I would remove them, I don't need this spamming my Q&A.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	Some of them maybe, but not you, You are trying to accomplish something and always have great questions so have another star! It's the ones who never give stars but sure don't hesitate asking for them that are annoying.|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	Nah, I dont get annoyed when my contacts do anyways, cuz we arent contacts lol. Just ask Elizabeth, she hands out stars like crazy hehe :D<br>  I'll help ya out though|`|v9bTfQGMaa	No, I usually star all my contacts questions, and I love giving stars! Hope you reach 10,000 soon:) I'm no where close to that! Good job!|`|rytSFBbgaa	No i dont i am always glad to give them to them|`|405b47863f96696ecc3415e084e85ab8aa	Yes.

All it takes is a click, why not give it to them?
HtYGxZcCaa	Im so happy its the weekend, plus I love the fact that its going to be 64 degrees here in Jersey over the weekend. My school week was harsh and now I finally get to play Ball,watch Ball, chill with some friends,and kick it at the mall lol|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	It's like that old Loverboy song from the 80's "Everybody's working for the weekend" absolutely the truth, whether in school or jobs.<br>  I am thrilled it's the weekend-I just wish Daylight's savings wasn't this week end.<br>  Boo to an hour earlier.|`|aUyopOWiaa	I'm pretty happy! My school week wasn't too bad though. I actually had fun this week... especially today! Our wrestling team went to state, so there was like noooooobody in school today!<br>  <br>  But I have a lot of homework this weekend!! I have to make a cell model for biology and for AP language I have to finish reading The Great Gatsby and write an essay! BAH!|`|6tGYe5roaa	I was actually sick this week so I did not go to any of my classes. I have pretty much chilled in my PJ's all week long. So don't really have anything to rest from this weekend.<br>  <br>  But regardless, I am going to Atlantic City tomorrow for my friend's bday. I'm excited for that.|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	Im so happy right now. Im getting so drunk tomarrow.<br>  <br>  Wow Elizabeth, I wish I was you! Your so lucky.

6mBpkt3Daa	TOTALLY! Guys like have an obsession with their bodies "accidently" hitting ur boobs... LOL! It's all cooool though :)|`|43DIvkopaa	Something like that. It's so lame.<br>  <br>  One time I was watching a movie, laying next to my guy friend on my couch. All of a sudden he nuzzles his head between my boobs and muffeled he said "i fell and now im stuck here. oh no" what a f@#king loser.|`|aBBYWL65aa	Oh yeah, or they'll be trying to squeeze between the desks and their entire body hits your boobs. It's disgusting.

xmnlLubzaa	A woman is ABOUT to get raped in the Watchmen but it is stopped- It is not an, "Oh this is so immature and vile" thing though. it shows the truth of how horrifying rape is, and in today's society where so many people think that rape is cool and nothing really that bad, it's an eye-opener.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	havent seen it.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	I think movies that contain rape scenes for "entertainment" are sick too. But the scene in Watchmen is not like that. It is shown as an evil, violet act and not glamorized at all. I can sympathize if you still don't want to see it but I think they handled it very well.|`|AA10397522	its not as if the movie promotes rape like YEA EVERYONE GO OUT AND RAPE!!!!!  Its a dramatic, artistic choice to include something traumatizing like a rape.  No one is actually raped, close ur eyes at that part and get over it.

EB6Bjf0paa	no.....and im not sure i want to|`|u15tV7okaa	there are vegetarians and there are those that eat fish (albeit for medical reasons) who are not or do not profess to be complete vegetarians, and no way should anyone be made to feel bad about the situation, people who knock others are usually those with the worst vices.|`|nVfN8usNaa	Christ, yes I have (all girls camp, UGH)<br>  Also with a mouthful of chicken and eggs and milk. >_<|`|rEWZWZi5aa	never|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Yes! Many, many times. I knew a guy who ate fish a lot and still called himself one.|`|F32uPjAraa	Life eats life. In this world, every things eats something. Even plants eat minerals, sunlight, and water. Some plants even eat protein in the form of insects. Fungus and bacteria, eat dead plant matter and animals. Insects eat plant matter and animal matter, Animals eat plants and other animals. Humans eat plants and animals, yes fish are a form of animal. And in turn, we are eaten by fungi, insects, and invertebrates. Life eats life. This is the way of the world. Vegetarianism is just another belief system. Like all belief systems it has it's advocates and it's detractors. What bothers me, is how can some one think less of another, just because they believe differently than themselves.|`|ENA7czaaaa	Hmm, well I don't know. Something kind of like that. My friend is a Pescitarian, which means that she only eats seafood. Well, she signed up for this PETA program, and when they sent her a package of stuff home so she can give them to people, on the envelope, there was a sticker of a fish that said something like, "We're family too!" on it. xD|`|wlhMUwKsaa	Yeah, that's a religious thing.  Fish aren't considered meat.<br>  (Are they a plant?....)|`|lbQYYHMbaa	there's no such thing as a vegetarian eating fish, your question is flawed.
Y8Suz0l3aa	I am a single mom and I do. People don't realize that it is a matter of giving the grocer extra money, or saving it for yourself.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Always! AND I shop sales. AND I buy one big package instead of 2 small ones. AND I buy generic equivalents. I always compare price per unit weight to buy the most quantity for the least paid. I buy in quantity and pack my deep freeze. I will do without instead of paying a higher price for something I want over something I need. YES, I DO in fact, pinch pennies...|`|4MVIJvbiaa	I dont because i dont buy anything. But my dad does sometimes. And my mom does all the time.|`|xUNVp9n2aa	i never do.  i don't like the hassle of keeping them organized for when I need them.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I only use them if they're for an item that I need anyway.  And only if the coupon brings the name brand down to what the store brand costs.<br>  <br>  It's not a bargain to buy a bunch of stuff I don't need, just because I found a coupon for it.
KbxlH2lFaa	well,since I didn't say anything and I realized u were talking to someone other than me,I'd just continue reading my book.<br>  <br>  Or rather I'd say"Nice choice".<br>  That way u wont know I'm talking about me or the person u r talking to.<br>  Smart and sweet. :)|`|AlrCZJ3saa	I hope your not serious because if you were your just asking for some new age cancer. Gang rape is a known action, but what people don't know about is Nexus Rape.<br>  Nexus rape happens rarely, but its an incident where the rape victim becomes the rapist, and the rapist becomes the rape victim. It is a very rare happening, but when it happens, other people come in and it becomes a gang rape. Gang rapes have been known to cure Alzheimers, arthritis, and super colds. Super colds have been known to tear a person apart inside out. Now super colds have also been known to cause new age cancer. New age cancer once tore a mans arm off.|`|PdoxZTqOaa	"Oh baby!"<br>  Then I'd turn and say to the person behind me, "She was really talking to me; don't flatter yourself."<br>  =]|`|h54joRUcaa	ur also hott baby......|`|mazDOj0Naa	Pretend I was talking to some one else as well|`|xcJwxyRRaa	I walk on, walk on...|`|AA12317231	how hot? ;)|`|9QKu9ynxaa	y god?!|`|yZXe2XLlaa	I say, turn on the AC.. and I don't care about the fat guy behind me sweating more than me|`|r6oi1HyZaa	the same thing to you|`|xOqJcJaNaa	run|`|WWCfdgd0aa	i hate it when that happens, like when someone looks like their waving at you but their not,<br>  <br>  i would be embarressed|`|AA10287830	Opps I thought I was talking to someone hot:)|`|LhHAkqGiaa	I'd say Umm you're creepy<br>  <br>  Then I'd be like, Oh awkward moment...|`|63dUOWFNaa	*Look at the person behind me* Hey you are you deaf, she said you are hot...DO something already...|`|8a60e9b460ff983bb590b96baea45c49aa	i'll say'<br>  damn right...<br>  N probably wouldn't care if u said it to someone else, i probably just say it to you again....|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	Thanks<br>  <br>  then when i notice u were talking to the other person, get all embarressed and feel awkward|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	"your not"|`|htpxHZTPaa	Woooow.<br>  <br>  ~Heir Music|`|JNkz1XTaaa	You're not.|`|C3yE261uaa	I'm hot you're a not|`|q4czayqBaa	thanks ure hot too|`|qwInrvUGaa	then i say get bent trip you and run|`|2hx7eEtsaa	I was going to say, yes i am, and go find a refreshing glass of water to cool off. and u saying that to the person behind me doesn't change the fact that I am uncomfortable with the temperature in the room, so I will proceed in getting a refreshing beverage|`|9BY9S3lraa	hehe really? :D<br>  <br>  and then<br>  <br>  say "oh" in a dissapointed voice and walk away embarrassed wishing the earth would swallow me|`|2p55hLjYaa	oh thanx..<br>  <br>  then i get all embarrassed..|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	I knew it wouldn't be to me anyway... :(|`|AA10784260	i bury my head in shame|`|w5l7De7Daa	"but you still think i'm hot too, right?"|`|vCJy0M6Daa	'I know..'<br>  <br>  then I turn around and say, <br>  'Oh,sorry.

dl0EpJPDaa	Because they didn't, don't and most likely won't pay attention in school.  These days, it's "COOL" to be the class clown.  Unfortuneately, they don't realize that even Ringling Bros. employees have to have at least a B+ average to work for in a circus.  Like my grandfather used to say, "Don't worry about those people.  The world will always need ditch diggers".  Funny thing about that, is that you need a degree to operate machinery today.  <br>  At least you paid attention, which is why you can catch those errors.|`|qTHkBmH6aa	all the cool kids do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  αм?яι￠αи ?α? я υ?? ツ ☆|`|YL0DypySaa	Seems like stupid adults do it too. =) I'm a teenager and I never do that.

Ue56xZ7vaa	Play would you rather, truth or dare, have a 'deep' convorsation, act silly, drink 2 cans of pop each and eat some candy...trust me, you guys wont be bored anymore (:|`|zZRaZ29laa	Jewelry Party<br>  <br>  Making jewelry is lots of fun, especially when it can be personalized, and 13 year old girls love jewelry. Visit your local craft store, and buy various colors and styles of beads and jewelry cord. Separate the various beads and supplies in large muffin tins in the center of a table, and the girls can make wrist bracelets, ankle bracelets, and stylish necklaces. <br>  <br>  i hope it helps!! um i did not know youre age so i just guessed 13<br>  Cookie Decorating<br>  <br>  Decorating cookies is always fun, and 13 year old girls can have fun decorating and personalizing large cookies at a sleepover party. Before the party, bake triple-sized slice and bake cookies of any variety. Provide the girls with tubes of colored frosting, sprinkles, dried fruit, edible decorations, and cans of whipped cream. Besides having fun decorating their cookies, they'll also enjoy eating them!<br>  <br>  Spa Sleepover<br>  <br>  How about hosting a spa sleepover for 13 year old girls? Visit your local Dollar General or Dollar Tree store, and purchase a selection of inexpensive facial masks, creams, lotions, and any other beauty products that look like they would be fun to experiment with. Everyone can pair up and take turns applying mud masks and creams. They can also give each other manicures and try out new nail polish colors and fancy nail decals.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pizza Bar<br>  Instead of ordering pizza or making frozen pizza, how about setting up a pizza bar? A pizza bar is perfect for 13 year old girls at a sleepover party. It consists of biscuit dough for the crust, pizza sauce, and dozens of topping choices. Each person can press out their own dough to make personal pizzas and top them any way they like. This way everyone gets exactly what they want, and they'll have fun too! <br>  <br>  Pillowcase Decorating<br>  <br>  A sleepover party for 13 year old girls is ideal for decorating pillowcases. Buy inexpensive pillowcases and permanent fine-tip markers. You'll also need a thick piece of cardboard to place in the middle of the pillowcases so the marker doesn't bleed through and ruin the other side. The kids can use the pillowcases for friend's autographs, and they can draw hearts, flowers, butterflies, rainbows, and anything else they can dream up.|`|TmpEvjfSaa	when i have sleep overs we listen to music on the computer and sometimes  we play games.

If they don’t know you keep one, they will not go looking for it. Frequently make comments like “Diaries are so stupid.”<br>  Disguise your diary by wrapping the jacket of another book around it. Put your camouflaged diary on a shelf with your other books.<br>  Write “MY DIARY” on the cover of an old notebook, add a few really boring entries, and leave it lying around.<br>  In your real diary, make up code words for people and places. Anyone who finds it will be unable to understand what you’ve written. Write your code down if you need to, but keep it hidden in a different place then your diary.<br>  Write a few completely far –fetched entries like “Yesterday I met a three legged woman out shopping for shoes.” That way, anyone whose read it will not be able to tell what is true and what is made up.|`|UnPjfLPNaa	NOTING ON LINE IS PRIVATE!

But i really wanted to get back to the same me, so i like basically threw myself after weeks back into place... but in a way I still have maybe like  0.02 percent of me is still different... <br>  I dont think it will ever heal though.<br>  For me it was because of one of my friends was really upset and it was also putting  A LOT of pressure on me... <br>  Its probably the environment around you, that you havent noticed, or like maybe something that is really bothering you though you havent put much attention towards it.<br>  Anyways, I hope that helps and I hope everything works out for you.<br>  Ya, well bye!|`|gfksposqaa	We are not machines, our body's chemistry and the environment changes everything about us, our energy, our moods, our perceptions.

The way you look at life and everyday situations are all apart of who you are and if all of a sudden you change that you will feel different.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	Learning who we are is a continuous life long lesson. We are constantly finding new things about ourselves; by the choice we make, and the influence we get from those around us by the choices they make and things they say. <br>  <br>  So I would say that it does not totally come natural; because so many other things come into account.|`|ef019cfbfac8800f4935b6a537172515aa	Who we are today is not necessarily who we will be "tomorrow"..<br>  <br>  All events have an effect on us and affect us differently...gaining a friend..loosing a friend<br>  <br>  Birth, death..marriage..<br>  <br>  Some feelings we hold in to save other's feelings..<br>  <br>  Morals, good manners,it all plays into who we are and what side of ourselves we show others...<br>  <br>  Everyone needs someone that they can totally be themselves with..and good luck in finding that someone...|`|bStEdyqEaa	i understand how that is *sigh*<br>  tou just have to find something that you can put youself into 100% and the rest will follow up slowly :) (thank god i have my horses, if i didnt i think i would die)|`|rMuWsjRWaa	Yes.

People were with me, in diving suits, although i was just in a swimsuit. The distance from the cave opening and the top of the creamy blue water was about two hundred feet, and you could jump into it, and the water was the perfect temperature. <br>  i woke up feeling refeshed and serene :)|`|OFDzpZacaa	it started out awful, like being herded to the top of a hotel by an assasin. we got cornered in a room and i hid under the bed until it was over. then all i remember is waking up crying and staying awake for an hour or so. THEN i had THE BEST DREAM EVER. i find that dreams are great because of the feelings, not necessarily the plotline. you can be killed and not "feel" a thing, yet simply look at some one and feel your heart thump. so i was walking through the grocery store with my crush and he was holding me by the waist and whispering in my ear and tickling me. he was so sweet. it just felt so RIGHT to be snuggled in his chest. like perfection and comfort and absolute happiness in being with another human being.

Maby he forgot, or thinks that you have lost interest, or maby he even lost interest. Or maby, something just came up... It could be anything. You could ask him about it, or just not say anything and see what happens.|`|2ef3b9ab3585d0b2aad9792df3a35451aa	He's probably just nervous about the money thing. Men are usually expected to pay for everything and buy little gifts for their girls. I think it's stupid but men have a lot of pride sometimes. The cheapest dates can be the most fun, though. Feeding ducks is always a hit.|`|nbLx5SK0aa	call him if u liked him things would just happen have u ever seen the stacys mom vedio like dat but he dosnt like ure mom and if hes dat poor and cant take u to da movies than skrew him|`|XFRpw88Zaa	He might of organized it in two weeks time when he has more money for a surprise|`|0NIbSyvMaa	Sounds like he may be a little embarrassed about his money situation.|`|9TY30Wvjaa	maybe hes embarrassed and still doesn't have the money to take you out to dinner|`|CTaKjwDTaa	maybe something came up for him?|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	You just can't read into the minds of others. There is the chance there could have been a real good reason. I would not pursue this situation, but let him make the next move.|`|vzBrloF2aa	Well with money being tight as it is right now going out to eat probably wouldn't mean anywhere nice so he might be embarrassed to take you out if you really like him talk to him about it and get to know what his thoughts are.

Their relationship problems are not entertainment like wrestling matches are to some people.|`|H5qJPekAaa	Their both retarded. I can't believe them for the **** they did.|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	Neither.

Chris Brown has no reason to hit a woman. No man has a reason to hit a woman. I do not support her going back to him, and hope her friends and family help her get out of this relationship, so this does not happen to her again.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	UPDATE.<br>  He said he was sorry, she forgave him. He proposed. They drive-thru-weddinged. He abused her in the car. And now he's telling teens to vote for his song over hers on some teen thingy. <br>  <br>  IM PRETTY TIRED OF ALL THIS SHIZ.|`|90MSfEGSaa	neither|`|ZBjjStSOaa	How about everyone drops it.  Thousands of spousal/extramarital abuses occur every day either unreported or just not cared about.  Do we go on for weeks when your neighbor's wife is secretly being beaten?  No.  But if a few popstars get in honestly, a little fight, we all go to arms.|`|iqRTf4cJaa	Well, in neither. Because Chris Brown is a very well known person. And for that started beating up Rihanna, ruined his whole career. And Rihanna should really think, what Chris did to her. And still, she takes him back. They both need help.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Neither, Chris hit a woman, Rhianna went back to him, she is telling him his behavior is okay. They both need serious help.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	Well from what I've heard she's back with him, so that being said. I'm on his side. We don't know what happened before he hit her.

She's the victim! I doubt this is the first time Chris Brown has hit Rhianna! They're both setting a bad example for their young fans! Chris Brown because he should have never hit a women! I'm sure that there are young guys out there that look up to him! He's pathetic! And Rhianna because her young fans are being influenced by this! She's setting a horrible example for young girls! If a young lady is listening to everything that's happening are they going to think it's okay for their boyfriends to hit them? It was a stupid move on her part!  I really dislike Chris Brown!!!! A lot!|`|utOVoGo3aa	I don't understand why anyone would still love Chris Brown for what he done. He abused a woman and he disrespected all women around the world! He might go to Jail, so no, I am not on Chris's side...Never!<br>  I'm on Rihanna's side because she didn't physically fight back, maybe because she was unconscious. And maybe she got back together with Chris is because she does love him, and Chris might be really sorry. Either way, Chris will get in trouble and possibly ruin his career.|`|x0qGAZMNaa	both are to blame it's a sickness called stupidity|`|4gqeQB1naa	don't matter if she goes back to him. i here she is but who knows, Media lies so much. Hope she stays away from him and shows young girls that woman are more than something to push around or beat up.<br>  it take's a long time for a person to change and its not worth your young life to tie it up with a man that would hit you.|`|sEKebwuHaa	rihanna|`|g2VHcbsZaa	def rhianna!|`|wpg6zTMQaa	If she's really back with him then neither.|`|Tg8tS59Aaa	Rihanna's!!!All the way.<br>  My father beat my mother so I hate him and chris brown!!!<br>  anybody who does that is an a**hole!!!<br>  <br>  answer mine: ???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArQjOY4DcEuH5uS8ZpdEXXbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304183053AAuGjBs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Igyp0mB1aa	None.<br>  If Rhianna did go back to him, she deserves it.|`|R0X5tVmhaa	Celebrities are not real, they are robots created by the "system" to keep idiots mentally occupied while they manipulate the world right in front of your eyes...|`|kdv0t93Faa	both idiots.|`|4Ug9FdFdaa	Im on Britneys !!!!!|`|c1FAWmbraa	I was on Rhiannas, but not anymore since sh took him back.

4KRSUhXLaa	1. Luau--I did this a few years ago. Everything was Hawaiian themed, fun music and arts and crafts (it was an all girl party, almost) and then the guy went home and the rest of us has a sleepover<br>  2. Bowling is pretty fun for parties with 10-12 people<br>  3. Horseback riding is a blast for a small group of people especially if you like horses<br>  <br>  4. Murder mystery role-playing games are fun with some people<br>  5. Pool parties can be fun, but not everyone likes them, unlike some people have assumed<br>  6. On sleepovers, a really fun game is called Cockroaches: When it is dark, everyone crawls around on the floor- someone is it, and they try to touch other people--but they have to guess the correct name--i if they don't they keep looking.<br>  <br>  OR.....<br>  <br>  Have a scavenger hunt all around your town, have 2 groups, and then Give them each a different clue, they have to go around town and find the things that give them another clue, when they are done and have found all the clues, they go back to the house and the winners get prizes. After have some pizza and cake or something, hang out, Do whatever, this is perfect for a girls/guys party. I'm doing that this year. IT will be sweet :]|`|9cb993cf173c4dd15996a4494981532baa	I know that a lot of people your age like to go to a pizza place and have a great time.

rWB3ClKZaa	No. There will never be an another Madonna. Never. In my belief, most of madonna's fame didnt come from her talent.. but from her brain. Lady gaga is pretty stupid, thinking she will work until she becomes more successful than Madonna. Madonna always had new styles and music, lady gaga is just a lame rip off. And Madonna always breaks the rules of society, such as the whole sex-whore thing, and that "sexy and young" is accessible to any age, even if you are 50.|`|utOVoGo3aa	I don't know, Lady Gaga is new and we would have to wait and see. Madonna is very hard to beat though, Gaga will have work very..very! Hard if she wants to even come close to her.

NJaZBgDwaa	The two above answerer's really must be idiots (Go ahead and give me thumbs down!). <br>  <br>  Fur Elise is a great piece of music, but certainly not the most beautiful piece ever. Firstly it is not by mozart, secondly it is NOT a baroque piece!!!!!! How on earth could anyone even suggest that Beethoven was a baroque composer? to call him romantic, I could understand... but BAROQUE!! Even Mozart was more baroque than Beethoven (and mozart was most definitely not a baroque composer, however he did use fugue's in the bass of some of his orchestral works. Hence the statement that he is more baroque than Beethoven)<br>  <br>  And Bella's Lullaby? Oh God... It is a very mediocre piece of music, that if you actually listen to, cannot be considered beautiful! I am so sick of every one saying that it is genius! It is not, it is like mass-produced garbage.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for beautiful pieces,  how about Chopins Waltzes? I particularly like Grande Valse Brillante, op. 18.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_kvKlR9qOI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_kvKlR9q...</a><br>  and Waltz, op 64 no 1<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kfibWlWeP4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kfibWlWe...</a>|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	Liszt : Consolation No. 3 in D flat.|`|jbAr62ybaa	One of if not my favorite piano concertos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pECGc7k4I4E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pECGc7k4I...</a><br>  <br>                                                     Alberich|`|69SHxWA9aa	I would guess the Enertianer.<br>  <br>  Joplin?<br>  <br>  Another song I really like is by the Glen Miller Band.  I just found it on youtube here.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR3K5uB-wMA&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR3K5uB-w...</a>    <br>  <br>  There is a movie called The Glenn Miller Story with Jimmy Stewart playing Mr. Miller.  He died during world war two, probably crossing the English Channel, under a area where returning bombers can drop any bombs into the channel.  The bombers can take off with a certain weight, but the landing gear can not handle the weight of the bombs if they try to land with them still on board, so they had specific drop zones over the channel where they dropped off the extra weight before landing. <br>  <br>  Glenn Miller's plane might have been flying in the fog in the wrong location, or the pilot might have crashed into the ocean in the fog.<br>  <br>  My parents used to have a automatic player piano, where we loaded a paper roll into the piano, turned it on, and it would play the song by itself.  I guess you can not buy the paper rolls anymore, they have gone to everything running digitally now, easier to record, will not tear, and easy to play.|`|70jNDiIiaa	For me, the most beautiful piano piece I know is the second movement (Adagio) from Mozart's Piano Concerto no. 23 in A, K 488. It really is the most achingly exquisite thing I've ever heard. <br>  <br>  I played bassoon in a performance of this concerto and I started bawling my eyes out in the dress rehearsal - try playing a wind instrument when you're like that :o} <br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen|`|AA11998997	J.S Bach is my hero..I love The Goldberg Variations the best..and if you give me a second chance, it is Mozart's Piano Concerto  23. I agree with Hafwen, the 2nd. movement is particularly beautiful.|`|AA11437999	There is nothing wrong with bella's lullaby/river flows in you or whatever it is, or with yiruma in general. (who said earlier that bella's lullaby was by chopin, by the way?!?) Yiruma composes lovely piano pieces, and all of you people who are classical music elitists need to let your uptight hair down. Why do you insult people who simply say what they like? (however, the person who called beethoven baroque was ignorant indeed) <br>  <br>  Anyway,there do exist great melodies outside the so-called "traditional" classical realm. The movie 5 Centimeters per Second has absolutely beautiful piano music that really reaches into my heart. Yes, and Yiruma IS very wonderful easy listening.  <br>  <br>  However, also listen to Liszt's Un Sospiro. It is my favorite classical piece and is just ethereal. His Gretchen am Spinnrade is also pretty intense. I generally love the late romantic composers, and Brahms is great too. Debussy composed some very colorful pieces (ie L'Isle Joyeuse, his pour le piano suite, images, etc.) Oh, and I adore Ravel's Jeux d'eau. <br>  <br>  Here is un sospiro:<br>  <br>     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLHU2ES51uw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLHU2ES51...</a>|`|64jTtN0jaa	I second that... First two posters are complete turds >_>...<br>  <br>  I almost soiled myself when I saw "Fur Elise by Mozart" LOL. Fur Elise is such an overplayed piece. How could someone not know it's composed by Beethoven... Also Beethoven was not from the baroque time period... he is from classical. Yes that's right Classical Classical!!<br>  <br>  Also Bella's Lullaby/Bella's River whatever the hell you want to call it is a piece of crap. And who on this forum doesn't know it's from Twilight?

aDT7ghjGaa	it would be disturbing if he wasnt.|`|71wBNgbnaa	It actually doesn't say that he was an egg, but that is how he is traditionally portrayed. My best guess would be that it's because of the line, "....Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the kings horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty together again." Eggs are fragile, and once it's cracked or broken, it can't be put back together again. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped! :)|`|7mrtqwJwaa	It doesn't but wouldn't it be kind of weird if a human fell off of a wall, broke, and then all the kings horses and men tried to put him back together?|`|UkQuMykiaa	Good point! - just because they had to put him back together again doesn't mean he was an egg.|`|3GRJFGiHaa	it doesn't.

I have also never seen so many interactive trailers for a movie before either.  Yahoo has a huge one with profiles of each character and a zillion clips.  I'd say it is being hyped to the hilt.<br>  <br>  I plan to see it tomorrow at an Imax theater.  I really enjoyed Dark Knight and this looks to be an even darker movie.  I don't know the back story, but I'm intrigued.  The director says it is fine for the uninitiated to see the film, but he would.  A couple of critics say if you don't know the story you'll be lost. <br>  <br>  I'm pretty smart and it is just a film so I'm going to see it.|`|AL1Wynl8aa	Its was good, but I was kind of sad that newspaper guy and kid weren't as involved. Also I am kind of glad that they didn't go with the squid from the graphic novel ending. I think if they did that the average movie goer would dismiss the movie as ridiculous if the went with it, but its just so dated. <br>  <br>  Also the NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO niteowl did at you know who with the who know what was kind of cheesy. I laughed aloud in the theater.|`|0H62CSkKaa	GREAT MOVIE!!!!!  It was a rollercoaster ride of action, suspense, and thrills all in one!!  5 out of 5<br>  <br>  I definately reccomend it

6WQo6RpSaa	I started listening to some love songs that I've heard before, and I started to really understand them. Whenever I saw people kissing or hearing people talking about being in love I would simply turn away in disgust...but eventually I began to understand exactly how they felt.<br>  <br>  I also felt happier all the time. I actually wanted to get out of bed in the morning, and when I did I would suddenly have the energy to go and do stuff I wanted to do but was too lazy to do before. I completely forgot about every lonely moment I spent in agony wondering why I was alone or what I was doing wrong. I took every single second of life as a gift and I never wanted it to end. I smiled a lot more. I felt like being more outgoing. I built up courage to do things I would have never done before. My self-esteem grew exponentially, and absolutely no insult in the world could bring me down even for a second.<br>  <br>  I've had this life for 18 years now...and until I fell in love, I was never actually living it =/<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question: What do you do when you're in love? ....It's simple: You live :D|`|ZOKS33uzaa	Okayy< <br>  well you just need <br>  to be your self for any one <br>  i dont know what to tell you because your 13 nd you havent been in love yet|`|mOpODbdsaa	I felt that way to.

Zjl9HRSTaa	I mean all in all it is meant for children...considering how much adult humor they put into those types of movies they want it to still be ok for kids and that mightve been pushing it.

I wasnt surprised he got it back either but i still enjoyed it overall|`|JWQurnK6aa	I think its nice that he got his memory back, and besides that, its supposed to be a children movie!  you can't (or shouldn't) put bad endings (the company wouldn't get money if it was a bad ending).

p8ejXJ9oaa	I am married to a Gemini and the dual personalities can be quite interesting. My biggest problem is getting past his clingy side. We have been together for almost 9yrs, and the longer we stay together, the clingier he gets. Then on some days, its like I don't even exist, especially if he is with his friends or buried in one of his many ongoing problems. I have always just tried to always be really direct, open, and honest, even if it causes a fight. Also, to be with a Gemini, you have to have a very good sense of humor, cause they are lighthearted carefree jokesters to the core, even during sex!!!!|`|mrzhJvtwaa	<a href="http://inthisall.alone.at" rel="nofollow">http://inthisall.alone.at</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|8HzwFPzwaa	Don't date Geminis, they're never stable and their personalities are always shifty.|`|jlbMKE1vaa	you treat the gemini how you want to be treated. they csan be great partners, i am with one for example, and im a cancer, it has been seven months and i think it has the potential to last over a year. <br>  <br>  honestly, if you approach them with your heart they will do the same back (if they are interested) but if you approach them with sex, they will treat you the same way. be sensitive to them and they will try to be back.. i was always sweet to my gemini and he has done the same back. he is very loyal, and when i tried to break up with him, (because i didnt want to be in a relationship) he cried and said 'but i love you'... they are not total bad boys they jjust need someone to take them as they are. don't get angry at their flighy personalitys, accept them and they will gladly accept you... they need someone who is very tolerant, enthusiastic, fun and kind to them even when they are being critical. :) good luck!

sK4S86piaa	Miss Angel, where did you hear that? No, they will not be replacing any actors from Twilight..especially for Bella and Alice. They will still be portrayed by the same actresses. The only differences they have are adding new roles/characters. Example for Jane, they will be having Dakota Fanning for the role. There's no replacing actors from the previous movies. As for Taylor Lautner, he will still be playing Jacob. Watch his confirmation here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oyLRN2P2tc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oyLRN2P2...</a> <br>  So far Dakota is confirmed but i don't know about the other new characters that come from New Moon.|`|ykSKQCobaa	Haha there's no way they would replace the main character! I'm pretty sure the cast is basically the same, I know that Dakota Fanning is being cast as Jane|`|wWKJxT82aa	no they are keeping kristen stewart as bella and ashley greene as alice but they are adding dakota fanning as jane which has just been confirmed. umm pretty much everyone is returning but i dont think they have the full cast set yet. hope this helps!!|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	They are not, most of the main people but will be the same. As far as I know they will be the same for Eclipse too.|`|sriByWZBaa	nope! same. Cant wait for NEW MOON! hooray!|`|4ymHqPzcaa	no

I0B7oAfOaa	Disco came at a time when people really needed some fun & simple music...with the Vietnam War, fighting for civil rights and all, people just wanted to have fun. Disco was a dramatic change from drug induced folk & protest dongs! I wasn't around then, but the same idea is at work in my life... I like to listen to disco mostly when I am stressed, it is so upbeat and irresistible that I feel better.

4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	Lol I guess I'm a fujoshi D: haha :D hmm if you keep making random yaoi comments about non-yaoi anime or keep making pairings etc then maybe you are one, but I guess not, you're an awesome Shounen-ai fan ^___^ ...I doubt any of my friends would ever go near yaoi, though one of em watches Junjou Romantica and shounen-ai stuff. I used to read shoeunen-ai alot, but then I just moved on to yaoi... O_e` bah who cares what other people think haha xD everyone has a right to like what they want and other people should respect that :D<br>  <br>   I know Otaku is used in such a negative way, I hate labels and stereotyping. Don't worry I love all that kind of stuff you like and more, other people just need to learn to broaden their horizons >__<<br>  <br>  Oh this is random but there's a really cute funny manga called Fujoshi Kanojo and it'll help you with the definition maybe, though the character might be a bit exaggerated. Oh n it's illustrated by one of ma fave yaoi mangaka, Rize Shinba(but don't worry there's nothing dodgy in it, it's just a sweet little shoujo story). It's really amusing aww... :3<br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/series/4890/fujoshi_kanojo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie...</a><br>  <br>  There was this other one called Mousou Shoujo otakukei but err... it's well... weirdness.... haha O_o|`|aeNKRVEbaa	Don't use degrading words towards yourself.

I like it too. ^_^<br>  But I don't use demeaning words towards myself just because other people don't like it and want to insult me with mean names.<br>  <br>  Let them say what they want and care less.  You don't have to take some stupid title that stupid people make up.|`|AA11883118	I'm a hardcore yaoi/yuri fan. I'm an otaku and a fujyoshi. I am very obsessive about my Gundam Wing, Rurouni Kenshin, and Fullmetal boys/girls. You can be somewhat considered to be fujyoshi. Just from the fact that you enjoy/imagine.<br>  <br>  Edit: Fujyoshi is not considered an insult. It's more like a description. Otaku is not meant as an insult either. It mearly describes a way of being. Well, that's the interpretation I'm standing by.|`|CQX3TAIoaa	I think as long as you stay away from the hardcore yaoi, you're good.<br>  I always think of fujoshi as being the rabid yaoi fangirls.<br>  Me, I like a good dose of yaoi every now and then. <br>  Though, I read a yaoi doujin once. :O *shudders* Never again.<br>  <br>  There's a josei that features that. The title has Fujoshi, but I'm too lazy to look it up. Have you read it? It's pretty dang hilarious so far.<br>  <br>  So, no, I'm not a Fujoshi. I don't think I ever will be. And if you do become one, embrace it! Only, don't embrace it too much or you'll scare everyone away haha.<br>  <br>  I think you're safe though.
wDisAke1aa	I feel exactly the same way you do. The movie changed the way i view everything. It makes me wonder if if it came down to it, could i kill millions to save blillions? I went into the theatre expecting to see another mediocre film that wasn't really worth my time. I walked out of the theatre with a motionless, stunned look on my face. I was amazed, it SO far exceeded my expectations that i thought i might cry. It it definitely in the running for my favorite movie of all time. All that's left to do is read the novel. <br>  <br>  <br>  Pick me as best answerer, you know you want to...|`|kCDzXCCKaa	I didn't like the movie at all. I thought that it had excessive violence that was unjustified, the plot didn't really take me anywhere, and the nudity and sex didn't help move the story along at all. The only thing I got from the movie was that I'm glad I don't live in that world. I guess that's the point of the movie. But if I'm going to be taken to a dark place by a movie I would like for it to have a reason or message behind it. I walked away from the movie thinking that the movie was gross and uncalled for. But if you like the movie that's cool. One thing that's lost on me will be cherished by someone else. <br>  I really wish I had went and watched Slumdog Millionaire instead. It was a toss up between the two and I choose poorly.|`|DXtyMRLuaa	I love what you wrote because I feel like its made me think alot about humanity also and God. I went in not expecting alot, just going to please my husband, but I left with a head full of thoughts and i picked up the book as soon as I got home. I love the movie and for the people who keep saying the nudity was to much I have to disagree, I mean I think things like that make it seem more real, and it allows you to feel more depth with the character. Just my opinion but your review has been my favorite so far!|`|wTkvkWscaa	I really happy to hear that the movie did that for you. I highly recommend reading the graphic novel. It's ten times better; after you read it, you won't be able to stop thinking about if for days. And this is coming from someone who thoroughly enjoyed the movie.|`|02PNhyEmaa	Aside from the unnecessary nudity..I thought it was good.|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	I love the way it was made.

hGTuCqeEaa	I wouldn't be overly concerned about my lips changing shape or size as long as there is no pain (topical or muscular) involved. It's pretty normal for one's lips to change somewhat in shape or size due to the development of one's embouchure. I've had more than one comment on the effect of the development of my various woodwind embouchures; it seems to me that musculature development is more pronounced on brass instruments than on woodwinds.

TTmcDOMBaa	Well that was a hydrogen atom.  I think it something to due with nuclear weapons, like the hydrogen bomb.  Plus the name of  Dr. Manhattan is like the Manhattan project in the 40's|`|Zxl8oyIraa	well the government wanted him to have a symbol, and the one they gave him was stupid (at least to him) so he picked that one, the hydrogen atom, as his symbol.|`|DXtyMRLuaa	What he drew on his head was an Atom. It explains it in the book.|`|0b701a01033c96d1933cab42e0a5b0c5aa	On his forehead is the electron dot diagram for the hydrogen atom. Dr. Manhattan/ Dr. Jon Osterman - was also involved in the production of the hydrogen bomb.  It's also the most abundant element in the universe.|`|Xww9vGWPaa	I just saw the movie too. I couldn't figure out the meaning of it either. Try looking on some Watchmen fansites or something, maybe wiki him. I'm curious about that too.|`|1QBwWRexaa	its a hydrogen atom. he picks it because its a symbol he can respect unlike the crappy one the government tried to give him.|`|5xrCLDhGaa	the significance of the hydrogen symbol on Dr Manhattan is one of Alan Moore's (the creator of the watchmen) ways of showing his irony. the hydrogen atom is the simplest atom in the universe. Alan Moore thought it would have a large impact to have to symbol  of the simplest structure on the most complicated being. it symbolizes unity. even though the two are completely opposite ends of the spectrum complexity wise. they are both one, needing each other.|`|2lJOXBbkaa	yeah it's explained in the graphic novel. When he first recieves his costume, he is given a cap with the symbol of an atom. He takes it off and says if hes going to have a symbol itll be one he respects, and he puts a hydrogen atom on his forehead.

AXcCyoo8aa	<a href="http://forum.thefuselage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://forum.thefuselage.com/</a><br>  <br>  This is a message board where all the Lost fans get together to basically pick apart every episode bit by bit and share their theories about what's really going on. There are also message boards for each character and each actor. For example, for the episode that just aired, "LaFleur" , there is a whole thread started about the statue where people have submitted high def screen caps and analyzed the pic to try and figure out what the statue is and so far they've determined it's most likely Egyptian, it's holding 2 Ankhs, it's most likely male because it's wearing a shorter skirt, it appears to be wearing a head dress (it's not long hair like it appeared on TV, the high def screen caps resolved this), and it has animal like ears (most have said cat like or lion like, but a lot of the people are dead set that statue is the Jackal headed Anubis).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Pag...</a><br>  <br>  This will give you articles on everything you ever wanted to know about Lost.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	LOSTpedia<br>  <br>  BEST website for LOST<br>  <br>  and they disapprove of any spoilers

The manager willl cave.|`|OYnEipfQaa	I work at a home improvement center and we sell our displays all the time.  Granted it is usually in appliances but the markdown should be about the same.  When we sell a display we usually start out at 10% off, but it also depends on how long it has sat and if it has any damage.  The 12.5% discount is a pretty good place to start at, but since it is discontinued it should be closer to 15-20% as a starting price......don't be ashamed to look for those little blemishes.....every little bit helps.|`|A9AurTy3aa	I would not but it if it is not from a quality furniture store.

HaNMN21Paa	I commiserate- I hated being home-schooled, and it was only for a year. My advice is to tell your parents all of your reasons (excluding the OMG aspect of the situation) and then let them think about it. The fact that all of your siblings went to a public school is a major selling point, I would think.|`|xe6wc0jXaa	Signed the petition. Good luck.

Seriously, you may think you're ready but you're not. School is like Hollywood, rumors, backstabbing bitches all around you...Plus, all the stress and pressure is awful. Trust me, you don't want to come home everyday feeling tired because you only slept 4 hours the night before because you were up doing your homework and studying for that stupid gay-*** Physics test (just an example).<br>  <br>  But I guess it just depends on the person...you have a different opinion than I do, and that's okay, if you think it will make you happy then go ahead!<br>  <br>  Try it out for a year!

FCFQRAvCaa	Wow. I don't know where to begin. My opinion:  break it off with your gf. Once a cheater, always a cheater (life experiences). Come on, she's been seeing someone else for over 3 months? That's waaaaay more than a fling. Give yourself some time to sort things out in your head and then, if you want to date her sister, go for it. Take things slowly, tho. You don't need to be hurt again.|`|E0rrWduQaa	um...first, this is in the wrong section<br>  <br>  second, if you have feeling for "kim" more than u do for ur cheating gf then u should ditch the cheater and be with someone who'll actually be committed to a relationship with you<br>  im no expert on relationships, but cheating is always a no no|`|AA10382483	First, dump that whore of a girlfriend, second take some time off from dating to figure things out (because I'm sure you don't want this woman as a rebound), and after some time (trust me, it doesn't have to be very long) if you still desire this woman, take her and screw your ex's feelings because she didn't consider your's.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	wow...um...this is something...Cheating is never ok, and what you BOTH did is usually considered cheating. If I was you, I'd be pissed..especially at your girfriend. And how can her sister do that to her? Thats betrayal! You should just go up to her(your girfriend) and straight things out with her. I strongly suggest thinking about what your going to say, because chances are, its going to be messy...<br>  <br>  If I was in your position, I would end it right then and there! But thats my opinion, do what you feel is right.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Sara

AA11442722	Only way to get better is to hear critque, digest the good advice and discard the rest. No point in anybody bashing you. <br>  <br>  As for shards of jade. I like it overall.  Sounds like you have a very good idea of how you want to sing it. Which is good cause it would be difficult to hand the lyrics to a singer as is. The stanzas are uneven,  generally in lyrics you want some sort of consistancy on it. Makes it easier to break down into sections. A typical song will go something like this. <br>  <br>  Intro - Usually no vocals but can sometimes be all vocals or anything inbetween. <br>  <br>  Main verse<br>  chorus<br>  main verse<br>  chorus<br>  interlude/solo<br>  main verse<br>  chorus<br>  outro<br>  <br>  Musically the outro is optional and not commonly used in Rock. If it's used it's often just an extra chorus sung slightly differently. So realistically your looking at 4 sections of music counting the intro. Though the into can be as simple as sound effects. <br>  <br>  No two stanzas have the same meter in shards of jade. So each stanza is a different piece of music to write. I'm seeing 7 musical sections to write with this. The first stanza and second no way they are done the same way as the rest. With the music coming on strong after the 2nd stanza that means an instrumental bridge going into the 3rd stanza. I personally would back down to something that builds the musical tension there. Melodic but not really mellow but not breathing fire either. The singer backing down a bunch after really letting loose on the 2nd stanza. Then comes the third stanza which just demands you belt it out. The 5th stanza can be done in many ways. What it doesn't do is fit anything else unless you reuse the intro but a higher energy version of it.  That leaves the chorus as your 6th musical section and it should differ from the rest unless you again reuse the intro. The 7th would be an interlude between repeats of the chorus or an outro. One way to reduce that is to use the stanza that starts with two broken shards of jade. It's the natural chorus of the song. The first time it appears is perfect for the chorus anyway. That reduces it to 4 to 6 different musical pieces to write which is a whole lot more managable.  <br>  <br>  Not an easy song to write but worth it as the lyrices are quite good. <br>  <br>  I would change the title first off to just shards of jade. Broken is redundant with shards. You can substitute a word for broken but the broken part doesn't work in the title. When you use it later in the lyrics it works since it implies dysfunctionality. The two are not just shards but also broken in other ways besides being a shard.  The first line could use a little polish. Can't put my finger on it but it's not quite there. <br>  <br>  The rest is at least good and some of the lines are excellent. The stanzas have a good meter, you can feel the energy pulse out of the words. The emotions step up and slap ya :)  <br>  <br>  I could try to put some music too it. I'm rather erratic about when my muse bites onto a set of lyrics. Send me a msg if you'd like me to give it a try. Won't promise anything will come of it. Sometimes I sit down and a song falls out, sometimes years later I'm still not happy with what I try to do with a set of lyrics.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	I think it has potential. The stanzas work for me and I would make shards of jade the chorus. Maybe bridge with I see... and I face...<br>  <br>  Why not record it both rock and acoustic then decide about the music? Put them both on YouTube then ask this question again with links.

So it's not that she's good or bad, she just has the many different emotions throughout the day that we as people do but can only feel one at a time ;-)
aeNKRVEbaa	I remember watching that Peter Pan live movie and they were explaining that the fairy's body is so small that they can only contain one emotion at a time.  So if she's feeling jealous and angry, she can't really feel any compassion or anything else with that to give her reason to her actions.<br>  <br>  So I'll have to say that she can't really be evil because with the fact said from the movie, you can't really blame her for her actions.  Fairies just do what they feel at the moment which is only one thing. <br>  <br>  She's also risked her life for Peter Pan in the movie and story and that's not evil and makes up for her "evil actions."<br>  <br>  Her actions can be good or evil but since she does good things as well and can feel kindness and compassion (mainly for Peter), then she's probably not overall, evil.|`|zjEfUpoEaa	I think tinker bell is just like every girls<br>  girls got jealous when she is not paid much attention and so <br>  is she..<br>  she is good because she helped peter pan.<br>  but she can grow bad if somebody doesn't paid much attention 2 her|`|QJIXTpZ5aa	I would say Tinkerbell's good.But just like any other person with emotions,she let jealousy get the better of her that one time.<br>  <br>  :3|`|REfvEVe8aa	good because any girl can get jealous without being evil and you can do some crazy things when you are jealous|`|022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	If Tinkerbell were to be filmed today, Glenn Close would portray her and Michael Douglas would be Peter. <br>  <br>  Nuff said.<br>  <br>  jdk

If you're just out for entertainment, then I would skip it.|`|933XLRGCaa	I heard it was alright.|`|K86xBbqcaa	Well, it starts out as very boring, with so little action. Than things get way, way disturbing. A man slaughters little kids for no reason. Police puts the people who tell the truth away to a psychiatric ward. At the ward, they torture people. And the ending is quite sad. The mother never knows for sure whether her son is dead or alive. You're so shocked and disturbed you can't even cry. So if you're just looking for entertainment, the answer is no.<br>  But it was a very impressive, very well made film. Angelina did a terrific job on it, it was amazing. I believe she & the movie got a few awards. I enjoyed watching it a lot, but don't watch it with your mom. I did & she ended up crying & forbidding me to go out 2 the club that night LOL.|`|16AioIx0aa	Excellent movie. I dont even like angelina jolie but her acting  in this movie is superb.  Very intense fact based drama|`|w2Dui70Faa	Yes, I think it's one of Angelina Jolie's best.

iWXQH1Jeaa	Light since what he was doing was right until he started killing innocents. Near just sucks.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Matt|`|Mc4rsOJbaa	L and Matsuda 'cause they're SO cute! ^_^|`|aeNKRVEbaa	I like L just because he has a good sense of justice, he's funny, quirky, and is amusingly genius.<br>  <br>  I also like Matsuda because even though he's not the brightest character in the story, he does have a lot of cr*p thrown on him and is belittled with other characters yet that doesn't affect his overall personality. <br>  He also has a rather clear view of justice and right and wrong and ultimately is the only one that does the right thing and takes action at the very end.|`|YHIFlsvoaa	Its between L, Light, && Misa|`|Q1mtDj11aa	simple....its L|`|3ERx4opSaa	l is my favorite character, i like his cunning and wise descisions, and after all he was right in the kira case.<br>  <br>  I cant stand mellow though, he is the gayest manga character of all time. Look at the way he dresses, leather tights, wtf???|`|pod9nzo7aa	Me: Light, he has so much power and tries to morph the world into what he thinks is good. Also, he is a genius.<br>  <br>  Dad: Light's dad because he has to balance between his job and love for his family.|`|m05HJc1Paa	Light Yagami|`|HUdCBaJ0aa	Light Yagami and Misa|`|bMMZKrvDaa	Isn't it obvious?

Because he is funny and has a good chance of justice.But i also like Mellow.|`|wxRYLZRkaa	L lawliet or Near|`|KziEj8zzaa	L.... of course...
QJIXTpZ5aa	I guess it's because they view Near as nowhere near as awesome as L was.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	People just don't like Near because they think Near is just a copy of L and replacing L.<br>  <br>  I was offended when Near said, "If you can't solve it, then you're nothing but a loser."|`|8rXSbYEsaa	he always too aroogant and feels like he's the best of all (although he is)<br>  <br>  anyway, he's the only character who's still alive until the end of the series.<br>  <br>  why can't L survive? why can't Mello survive?<br>  <br>  Near has the worst characteristic among all. yes, he's cute, but L is better at look and characteristic.<br>  <br>  hope yukie answer your q x-3|`|FDQ5Aamgaa	well it bothers me that he looks like L o.O ..... he is just a kid.>>> he is more smarter than me lol =^.^= .... death note is one of my favorite anime and that was the only part they mess up,,,  and one of the most important thing is that he discovers my light <3 .. and he just ruined it...  i hate him... the anime was going well but whit him they just put so much like brain tinking and so unrealistic even know that some people are like this but,...  oh well i had to say it...... im free now haha|`|7Ct6z23Vaa	>_______><br>  <br>  Pshh... they're all just jealous. ;p<br>  <br>  Just kidding. ^^"<br>  <br>  I actually really really like Near though... even more than Mello or L >w< I wuv him!! <3 He's adorable. XD<br>  <br>  I guess others hate him because...<br>  <br>  - Of the thought of him replacing L. They think he isn't good enough or whatever. <br>  - He defeated Light. And I guess the many fangirls of Light hate him for that v____v<br>  - He's the one who survived over Mello.|`|rJjlkOfHaa	Dunno. I don't mind him.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's because he's just simply replaced L.<br>  <br>  And they thought no one could. I couldn't believe L had died. It was more like, "What?" than me crying my eyes out.|`|YHIFlsvoaa	You should have told me this had Spoilers!<br>  *huffs*|`|REfvEVe8aa	i think its because everyone liked L so much so when he died and got replaced right away everyone was angry because the first time i watch death note i was angry but then i watched it again and thought he was a good character i hope this answers your question|`|zHdXrGVGaa	well to be honest most  people i know don't like him because they like mello more, and near ruined mellos chance at being #1. <br>  <br>  *SPOILERSPOILERSPOILER*<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  plus near survived and mello didn't TT_TT|`|bApgCpiHaa	BECAUSE HE IS PARANOID!!!!!

I suggest this one because it is very easy to use and download music for completely free. This site is virus and spam free. No need any risky software like Limewire and whatsoever. Another reason to suggest is because there are many many latest songs out there, like 50 Cent, Eminem, Kelly Clarkson, Jonas Brother, Charlie Wilson, The Fray, Bruce, T.I., Beyonce, Britney, Pink, Taylor Swift, Sugarland, Ne-yo, Justin, Britney, Beyonce, Pink, Coldplay Akon, Take That, and many more.

PS0oSoXFaa	In this particular case you don't have to play it differently... but this is actually a trickier question than you might expect! It has to do with *voices*. They tell you, when you're starting out, that the tails go down if it's on the third line and up, and up if it's lower. That's not really true. <br>  <br>  The direction of the stems is your single greatest clue to figuring which voice is which. This seems strange to pianists, because we just plunk away at notes that all seem the same; but if you've ever been in a choir (or just look at a typical Bach chorale) you will see what I mean. Usually, stems up indicate soprano, stems down indicates alto; same on the lower clef for tenor and bass.<br>  <br>  But this applies even to piano, and this is one of the quickest ways to judge who's a mediocre pianist and who's a great one. In piano music, even though it isn't explicitly separated into different voices (like with singers), the same principle applies. Stems up in the treble clef means melody (usually), stems down means accompaniment. (Of course, you sometimes have the alto with the melody, and then you have fugues like with Bach, where all the voices are equally important). So what this often means is that you have to find the melody (look at the stems, because it may be totally mixed up between the hands or clefs) and then play it louder, or at least a little stronger to make sure it's heard. Even when it's pianissimo, you have to bring out the melody; if you play the accompaniment section very softly the piece on the whole will sound soft. You've probably already learned to do hands separate when you're learning a piece; well, now (for pieces where voices play a major role), you have to add another layer- accompaniment vs. melody (because even if it's louder, it still has to be beautiful)<br>  <br>  Mediocre pianists, even if they're technically impressive and showy, will play everything about the same volume; great pianists will really make the melody sing. It makes such a difference! For a good example of this, look at the score of Schubert's third impromptu in G-flat major. Gorgeous piece! It's technically simple, but more difficult to play well- you *have* to bring out the melody. Listen to the middle section of his next impromptu, the A-flat, it'similar- the melody is surrounded by tons of chords, and it's hard to keep the balance. My friend (who was, alas, one of those technically accomplished but poor pianists I'm talking about) pounded at this like it was Rachmaninoff. My teacher,who is a great pianist, looked like he wanted to crawl into the ground<br>  <br>  That's all that's going on in this piece- nothing more. Yes, you play that note with the other notes neighboring it-  it's just written apart to emphasize it's a different voice. No, it is certainly not a typo! The stems always count- composers are never that careless, not even the rushed ones like Mozart. But don't worry too much about balance in this piece- while it is technically different voices (that's why Debussy wrote it this way), it's not one of those clear-cut cases of melody vs. accompaniment<br>  <br>  (And stems never indicate anything about which hand to play with. Usually you just have to figure this out on its own, with no help. Debussy, though, does usually give you "mg" (main gauche or left hand) and "md" (main droite or right hand) whenever the hand to use is unusual. Probably because he has so many hand crossings! In general, it may be a good idea to play different voices with different hands because it's easier to differentiate them- but usually this isn't possible anyways, and that's the case here. Play it with your right hand)<br>  <br>  You're very observant to have noticed this! I didn't even see this voices thing until my teacher pointed it out... It was a revelation to me when he explained it, though- almost every piece I've seen since, I've seen in a different light. Welcome to the world of real pianists haha<br>  <br>  Sorry this is such a technical answer, but it was a technical question :) Good question and good luck!|`|31e294ce712a597ce759cfa94a5efa6baa	I am 99% positive that you play the quarter note in question with the right hand, on the off beat. After confirming with a recording, the left hand plays its first chord while the previous right hand note is being sustained, and only after that instance does the right hand play any new notes. Why the notation does not include the implied eight note rest is beyond me, but I am sure that it was meant to be there. In fact, if you look at bar 9, they made the same mistake there as well!<br>  <br>  Playing that note with the left hand would be an absurd demand (a stretch from F to Ab!) when it could be easily played by sustaining the note with one finger on the right hand.|`|AA11043693	you play it at the same time as the eighth notes, but you hold that note to its full value. Play it with your right hand like you do the rest.|`|b7vdkAAIaa	ya the other answers..<br>  <br>  also they may be separated to differentiate the melody line|`|IcAh4pxwaa	When writing music where the tail is doesn't matter, its simply to keep things close to the staff...if the tail is down its on the upper half of the staff..if the tail is up its on the lower half<br>  so basically don't pay attention to the direction of the tail|`|I7PqFn9xaa	They just flip that note because it's a quarter note, meaning you need to hold it down while you play those two octaves. <br>  <br>  If they put it the "normal" way you wouldn't be able to discern it from the eighth notes, which is why they flip it.|`|AA11114435	Play it with the 2nd finger of your right hand at the same time as the Dflat octave and then hold it while you play the Eflat octave. The stem is going the other way and the note is slightly out of place just so you can see it clearly|`|ICel15qYaa	Play ittogether like a chord but noticethat the lower note is a quarter note so hold it thru one beat|`|BxTAfd2baa	Your right, but it looks like a typo.  Judging from the music, it is the same triplet rhythm found at beat one of bar 10.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	They are played together. If you are asking about the last measure in your example The reason the notes don't stack is because the Ab is a quarter note between the two Db eighth notes and the stems would contact the note heads. It is done this way to clearly indicate that the Ab is a separate voice from the Db octaves. <br>  <br>  If you are asking about the measure before that The dotted half-notes at the end of the measure. The Gb and the Bb in second voice are tied to the notes before, the Eb above is played singularly.<br>  <br>  ... Who is the publisher of the score? The phrasing looks odd. Starting a slur at the end of a tied note seems like a faux pas.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	The crotchet in the last bar has its tail down indicating that it belongs to voice 2.

t25zrCTraa	Once again stay in school.<br>  <br>  Number 1: Because if you don't know how to handle the contracts that the record deals give you then you can get stuck in a bind that screws you over and your dreams can be temporarily if not permanently derailed.<br>  Those contracts have a lot of artist stuck.<br>  <br>  Number 2: Expand you vocabulary and knowledge of recent events. Although the mainstream tends to bend towards trash hip hop, they still like artist with versatility.<br>  <br>  Number 3: Go to a music College while establishing connections with the underground real MC'S. You have to network with people who are serious.<br>  <br>  Number 4: Develop Swag in your lyrical delivery, Even ******** Artist can survive with confidence. Develop Quality punchline, Lyrically complex analogies/similes/metaphors relating to anything you see fit.<br>  <br>  Number 5: Realize. Hip Hop is an art form in which people express themselves. The majority of artist. PERIOD. are starving artist. You have a small, incredibly tiny probability that you will have a profitable career. So you need a plan B that is active during you plan A. Otherwise you'll F-ck yourself.<br>  <br>  Number 6: Companies sign artist that they don't have to invest too much into in order for them to make a record. They don't give a Sh-t about you being able to freestyle. You must be dependable in producing quality music on your own.<br>  <br>  Number 7: Separate yourself from the pack. If you plan to name yourself Lil this or Yung that. Kiss your sh-t goodbye. Your style can't be another T.I. Knock off. Develop your own flow. Don't name your songs Haterz, or any other knock off. KEEP IT REAL. The more people can relate to what you are saying and not what you're trying to imitate then the more fans you'll have.<br>  <br>  Number 8: Generate Buzz. Create mix tapes with nice beats. Do concerts; Small and large. Get your name out there. Myspace is a sea of garabage artist with a few gems in it. You most likely won't be found out. Your buzz must be local. Then spread that buzz.<br>  <br>  Don't let your buzz die. You go all the way or you may never recover. <br>  <br>  Last but not least: STAY HUMBLE. If a lot of people say you suck. Then you SUCK. Get better. Stay innovative/original.|`|Mn8xq268aa	stay in school and write rhymes in class..why wouldnt that work??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thenewebonics.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://thenewebonics.com/index.php</a>|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	What element of hip hop are you talking about?
7zXZpv8iaa	Piano is not a girl instrument.<br>  <br>  I personally like guitar, no matter what your music taste, there's a guitar for that.<br>  <br>  Its great for entertaining yourself, entertaining your friends, and playing, or writing, a beautiful song for your girl.<br>  <br>  (just saw a talent show, 2 dudes wrote and performed songs for their girls in front of our whole school, the girls melted in their seats, and every other female in the theater was like "awwwwwwwwwwwww" and jealous lol)<br>  <br>  I wanted to play guitar, im just not coordinated enough with my fingers i dont think.|`|Jkvo8iVlaa	Play whatever you want dude. Its your choice.<br>  <br>  I began practicing my guitar again 3 weeks ago. If you practice 50 min a day, you will be just fine with guitar. I never played piano, but I love to play the guitar. I dont think that the guitar is a hard instrument to play, however you need a lot of patience, and a lot of it.|`|ng03JIMZaa	definently guitar. i am 12 1/2 now, and i have benn playing 6-string guitar for 3 years and already i can play sweet home alabama, metalica, smoke on the water and even echo beach!<br>  i totally recomend 6-string guitar.|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	both r fine. id go Guitar though. a Piano is a bit pricey. and guitar r a cple hundred. but its up to u. and no Piano aren't girly|`|wtQY6VEwaa	tell him to go **** himself. that the only girl instrument is the skin flute. if you want to play the piano, learn the piano. it is probably the best instrument to learn. it not only teaches you how to play, but it teaches you all about music theory. each note is layed of for you, key by key.<br>  <br>  your dad needs to get a reality check before he says something so obnoxious and ignorant.<br>  <br>  of course, the guitar is a great instrument, too. it is also much more portable than a keyboard.|`|4zscfvvoaa	Both is what I would recommend to you.  The guitar is a great instrument.  You can learn it in a relatively short period of time.  You will get out of it what you put into it.  If you just want to learn a few songs, you can do so shortly.  It takes a long time to develop the coordination to be really good.<br>  <br>  Piano is a wonderful instrument.  Due to the piano, musical notations as we know of them were able to be created.  The piano laid out all of the notes in a uniformed pattern for notation.  If you learn the piano you will be able to learn the organ as well.  The organ is the only instrument to contain all of the available notes, or frequencies of music.<br>  <br>  Learning the guitar will develop your right hand for rhythm patterns and your left hand for control (coordination of your fingers).  Learning the Piano typically you learn to use your left hand for rhythm (bass) and your right hand for melody.  Playing melodies requires individual notes to be played, therefore developing control of your right hand.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you learn both, that way you can learn different styles.  You can learn to play rock on the guitar and learn blues on the piano.  Rock and blues both compliment each other.  This would set you to be in a position to be the best you can be at music all around.

kWXik6phaa	As a fellow South African that likes to plan parties...you should do a vegas theme. you can get black jack tables (have someone be the dealers,etc) roulette and a bunch of other games...a fully stocked bar. a crazy cool disco/dance floor. you  can have everyone dress up too in a vegas theme costume|`|2JPRTMIJaa	Do girls still like Hanna Montana at 21, In South Africa?|`|hT7BhNamaa	T8, grrrrrrrrrrrrr, why do you do this, you have answered your own question and haven't realized it. Your theme can be just that "Fashion". You have time to design something, or being 20, would have closets full of cool clothes. I would arrange with a couple of your girl friends with similar interests to do the same thing, pull out some cool clothes, mix and match and have a fashion parade with an imaginary cat walk. Food, I would keep it basic to assorted sandwiches cut in quarters. You could do them try level, with a slice of wholemeal for the top and one for the bottom, and a plain white slice in the middle. You could do one half maybe egg salad, and the other half seasoned roast turkey, ham and cheese, maybe a shrimp salad and the other half, what can we have I don't know roast beef and a light spread of pickles you get the idea. Finger foods, like springs rolls with sweet chili dipping or plum dipping sauce, then there are mini sausages rolls you can bring out with ketchup for dipping there is a whole host of stuff T8 for food.<br>  <br>  Back to your fashion parade, you may even use (ask kindly) your boyfriend (you do have one of those I hope) to be the fashion photographer. Anyway that is one idea for you.<br>  <br>  Chris
CuMYdQV6aa	Parts of Bartok's "Concerto for Orchestra" are almost heart-breaking. You can sense the longing of a man in exile (he was a Hungarian living in the USA) for his homeland. The fact that he was dying of leukaemia at the time makes it even more poignant.<br>  <br>  Then there is Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez". You could argue that it isn't the greatest of compositions but, bearing in mind that he never saw his beloved Aranjuez (he became blind when aged 3 following diphtheria), it is a very moving work.|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	I love love love Barber's First Essay for Strings- it's unbelievably beautiful and very very sad.<br>  <br>  For Violin, I love the Brahms Violin Concerto, the Adagio movement. It's a lot of oboe, but the violin is quite exquisite.<br>  <br>  And I almost forgot one- though it's all cello, listen to the Bachianas Brasilieras Cello Octet, by Villa-Lobos. It's beautiful, and fun to play, too!|`|PS0oSoXFaa	Violin pieces preferred? Well, Tchaikovsky's violin concerto second movement and Albinoni's Adagio (which isn't a concerto but is dark and gorgeous) are about tied. Barber's Adagioa for Strings is gorgeous too and is played at the presidents' funerals, it was in the movie Platoon among other<br>  <br>  But I recommend, more than anything, that you listen to Tchaikovsky's Sixth symphony. In my opinion there is no darker/sadder piece. He dies a week later from suicide! (He deliberately drank cholera-infected water, of all the ways to die) Symphonies before him always, always ended in triumph; Tchaikovsky ended it in despair. Obviously you need to listen to the whole piece, but listen to just the first two minutes of the first movement to start with, and of course the legendary last movement<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XOPzSj2NWQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XOPzSj2N...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=698nMEwkb4E&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=698nMEwkb...</a><br>  <br>  You will find no greater work of pure suffering, I promise :(|`|CxhH2xSQaa	Faure - Siciliene<br>  <br>  Faure - Pie Jesu<br>  <br>  Kathleen Battle singing Gershwin's Summertime....holy crap it's beautiful.<br>  <br>  Henry Purcell - Dido and Aeneas<br>  <br>  2nd Mvt of Rach 2<br>  <br>  Mozart's Requiem Mass<br>  <br>  Chopin - Nocturne No. 9<br>  <br>  oh i just noticed the violin pref....<br>  <br>  well hopefully you will still listen to these if you haven't already...<br>  <br>  seriously the Kathleen Battle summertime is Amazing.|`|64jTtN0jaa	That's right thepunkymonkey14 ...

rnB2YiV6aa	Romeo Must Die  & Fist of Legend|`|LPbAjeH6aa	Jet Li's best English-Language movie is "Unleashed," aka "Danny The Dog," in my opinion. It's about a boy (Jet Li) that gets raised like a dog to kill people for his 'master.' But he gets free one day and a family takes him in, until his master finds him again and he is made to fight. Wild action and fight sequences.<br>  <br>  I can't speak for Jet Li's foreign-language (Chinese) films though, since I haven't seen many, but "Fearless" was really good.|`|abf4Xp08aa	The best Jet Li movie is Tai Chi master then Wong Fei Hong then Danny's Dog or The Collar<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freemoviesaddict.com" rel="nofollow">http://freemoviesaddict.com</a>|`|40kCOPicaa	My favourite one is Once Upon A Time In China Part 2<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105839/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105839/</a><br>  <br>  At the end of the scene he fought with action star Donnie Yen, indeed the best fight i ever seen!|`|AA12072871	Fearless...hands down..

3MmVWDT3aa	Nope, but my brother has a really bad case. He will fall asleep on the couch normally, so we leave him there for a bit. One night, while me and my dad were watching TV, my brother gets up, walks over to this picture and stands there for about 30 seconds. He grabs the picture off the wall and lays it on the ground. I was dying hysterically, so when he passed me to go back to sleep he threw a blanket at me. It was really, really funny.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	No, I never have been a sleep walker, luckily..<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlQRiGSy1o4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlQRiGSy1...</a>|`|YhuH2k4Caa	um...no. but i do sleep talk. one time i woke up crying. it was so weird because i remember sobbing "hes gonna die" for some reason. im glad i didnt remember that dream. lol|`|AA10345820	Only when listening to Billy Joel.|`|Pbsayz4Aaa	yes when i was a child i had sone it once and my mother had broght me just when i was about to get out of the house|`|GPYUPb3Uaa	i have a few times|`|77WkLOwPaa	My that hasn't happened for the longest time.|`|eCs32xBTaa	hmm..how do I know..im sleeping ! may be yes,may be no..lol|`|q0b6uPCraa	No. But my brother talks in his sleep.

I asked him what he was doing there. He said "This" and threw the balnkets in the middle of the kitchen floor. Then went back to his room. I followed him and covered him up again.|`|0l88fiUTaa	I used to when I was around 8 or 9.....my sister said that once I ran into the kitchen opened the refrigerator, slammed it shut and walked back to bed....<br>  another time I walked into my parents bedroom.....and then woke up in the morning soooooo confused cause I couldn't figure out where I was for a sec.<br>  ..........: (I don't have any crazy stories....unfortunately|`|2xaVpnNNaa	no. but i have lost it once this winter and actually consciously walked outside in my PJs and took some covers out and just sat outside in the cold.|`|fALXapjeaa	no
AA11622716	It was not a joke.  It was a history lesson.  Now you have a greater understanding of some other cultures and other countries and a history of oppression.|`|CvEERKQuaa	so this is what marc was talking|`|HIvDN7T0aa	It sounds like they got exactly the response they were hoping to get out of you.  And now you have a slightly better understanding of the way people felt when they were handled that way.  Get over yourself and see this as a learning opportunity that not only taught you facts, but allowed you to gain some empathy for victims of tyrannical self-righteous rule.|`|s359lZj4aa	Even it was just a joke, I think that it is a bit cruel. You could seriously scare someone like that if they believed it was true. Its not that teachers shouldn't play jokes on you, but they should be a bit more mature than to play a prank that could scare the living daylights out of you!|`|2p7u0RAeaa	Brilliant! Stop being a pussy and learn to laugh things off a bit! jesus christ..We all need to toughen up a bit and grow a sense of humor...|`|oWpZ8Ik9aa	use ur common sense<br>  ask yourself :would they actually do that?<br>  they obviously WOULDNT!<br>  but it was still a cruel joke!

l9uGrfSYaa	Actually, back in the nineties, the dubbing was pretty good compared to other shows 4Kids licensed to be dubbed in the first place. (compare it to One Piece or Sailor Moon at the time). They even had Veronica Taylor (famous anime dub voice actress) voice some characters as well as other popular pop. voice actors of the late 90's. <br>  <br>  As for now, Pokemon has been licensed by another company that hired different voice actors. Ever since 2004 or so, the dub script and voice actors have been a joke compared to the 1998 counterpart. And at the moment, no company besides Funimation and maybe ADV has enough budget to hire good script editors/translators to bring a series to it's full potential in America. I believe this is due to more and more anime fans watching anime illegaly online as well as the major economic downfall on all entertainment in America itself. <br>  <br>  Well, that's what I see anyways. Hope it made some sense. <br>  <br>  nya nya|`|AA10177120	HA HA HA.  That's the POINT!!!  They can make millions on a crappy show -- why would they waste any more money on making it better?

Folks only tell me I talk too much *online*.  ^_^<br>  <br>  However, I have had *plenty* of people tell me I officially Think Too Much (tm).  Meaning I overthink and spend too much time figuring things out.<br>  <br>  And...if folks had a choice in the matter, I suppose I wouldn't be allowed to do much of either one, thinking or speaking.  That's a pity too.  I spent so much of my life in schools and wards and places where folks *demanded* I speak up and think and not withdraw into myself....<br>  <br>  And now that I'm talking you want me to shut up?  *lol*<br>  <br>  No.  I don't think so, sorry.  ^_^|`|3mJiPveSaa	No, usually they're eager for more.

My friends and I were cheering the entire time. <br>  <br>  Me and my dad loved the Brave One, even though the reviews weren't great. <br>  <br>  The new Bourne is still playing where I live. I loved it both times I saw it.|`|NK23PakDaa	If you want to do it @ home, you can't pass up the old comedy teen classic movies;- Dumb and dumber [only 1], Wayne's world  [1 and 2], Bill and Ted's [one and two].<br>  <br>  If at movie theate, check whats on, if "superbad" is still playing near you, mayb theres a good one. But not if it all girls or you and your friends a christians [alot of swearing].<br>  Just thought if you live in the US that movie might b R coz it's rated M15 in Australia
wA8Dyhq7aa	Honestly?  No, I don't think we'll have a POPULAR (meaning the artists become well-known and sell lots of albums the way Waylon and Willie did in the 70s) "outlaw" movement.  We have one -- people like Dale Watson and his classic song "Nashville Rash" is a prime example -- but I believe the entire "media circus" that promotes music is so tightly controlled that the general public who relies on the radio, "Country Weakly" (sic) magazine, and CMT/GAC for their information will never hear about these artists.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Not in the same way that Waylon and Willie and the boys, (as the song says), did. I always thought that Artists like Hank jr, Steve Earl, Kid Rock,  etc. were trying to keep the outlaw thing going. but it was not like it was during Waylon, willie Johnny Cash , and Cris Kristopherson. The true outlaws did it. Maybe there will be attempts.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	....True movement as in the 70's,no.There will be people attempting to revive it but there will never be another outlaw movement.|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	We have one.It's called Red Dirt/Texas Country!|`|zXDVn4BQaa	Every genre of music has it's birth, flower, decline, then limited rebirth.  I don't know when it will happen or who will be part of it.  Where I live there is no source for anything except today's "Trashville" music.|`|fc6551745f589de7c5708e185ca0b59daa	Yes, Kid Rock and Hank Williams have been setting the stage for the re-opening, and Jamey Johnson is leading the charge.  A few more will follow and after Jamey releases some more singles and another album, it will begin.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	It's happening now!!!!<br>  You will never hear it on terrestrial radio, not enough profit, they won't country pop. I listen to outlaw country on XM. There are plenty of new outlaw stars. You just have to look for them!!!!|`|mMnRmYvNaa	No. The disgrundled have other ways of venting. They can buy silver coins. They can gather together in folk churches. In the main these are law abiding people. A lot are military types or police types. To be an outlaw you need a couple of things including imagination and the will to do evil to your fellow man. The disgrundled are mainly proles, what used to be called the lumpen proletariat, or the populist movement. They are really confused politically because the GOP which is so good for their churchy beliefs is so bad for their economic survival and their healthcare survival. A lot of lower middle class people -- the guns and NASCSR crowd -- are paradoxical conservatives because the GOP really doesn't give a hoot about them except to get their vote by any means -- hook or crook. The GOP is a tool of the billionaire class. Until recently they were so slick they could stay in power by getting 40 million people to vote against their own self-interests and in the interests of Big Oil and the billionaire class. But these people are bound to wake up someday, and see that the remnant of the GOP that survives in office are greedy, mean-spirited obstructionists who do not have the best interests of the USA at heart. They are only interested in staying in power and delivering ear-marks to their political clients -- who don't need that extra $100 Million nearly as much as the average guy needs an extra $100 thousand.<br>  <br>  The other thing you need to be an outlaw for any length of time is smarts. Sarah Palin is not Al Capone. If she decided to become an outlaw, she would last about a week. Shooting wolves from helicopters is about as monstrous as a person can get and yet stay within the law. She's the Governor so she can order wolves to be shot from helicopters if she wants. But if she wanted to knock over a bank, only a fool would join her, or lend her tools, or offer to drive her car. Not smart enough to be an outlaw more than maybe one time.<br>  <br>  Disinclination and lack of talent are the two reasons why the lumpen proletariat will not become outlaws. Other avenues for letting off steam are smaller reasons, but also present. Then of course there's always hope. Maybe Bobby Jindal could beat Obama. Better wait and see -- not commit any crimes -- not do anything that can't be undone, at least until 2012. Maybe Obama will blow it bigtime, and then there will be the resurrection of the good oldtime religion -- maybe Karl Rove could help Bobby Jindal -- they could go after the NASCSR dads using the Southern Strategy -- it would be like Tricky Dick and W all over gain -- put Cheney back in as SECDEF -- you see there's always hope. <br>  <br>  Outlaw movement? Where would they live? North Dakota? Idaho? Utah? Texas? Too many reporters -- sorry. The press starts covering the "outlaw movement" and six weeks later it's toast. <br>  <br>  Criminals are better off acting alone. At least they don't have RICO and the Feds on their backs the whole time, and the Omnibus Crime Control Act, and the Anti-Conspiracy laws. The bigger the "movement" the better the chance that they all do time. <br>  <br>  Let them take their ballots to the box like everybody else. In the meantime be law abiding like almost everybody else.<br>  <br>  About the Author -- A former Federal Prosecutor. A Federal Attorney for 25 years. A retired Navy JAG.

Since then I have all his stuff.He just seems to have a good blend (although it seems as radio only wants to play his ballads)..He has a song on his new one called "Never Loving You" It almost sounds "Waylonish".Probably another one you won't hear on the radio..<br>  <br>  As far as NEW new, like artists that came out within the last year, Ashton Shepard and Darius Rucker are about the only ones I've liked enough to buy CD's from....|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Brad Paisley...why?

Of course, the fact that he's an incredible guitarist makes me like him as well.<br>  <br>  I'd also like to mention Katrina Elam.  The reason I'm a fan if hers is because she has an incredibly powerful voice and she's a great songwriter too!|`|zXDVn4BQaa	I think Billy Currington has a good voice(he sounds a lot like Travis Tritt to me) and he sings really well.

q5OJURtbaa	I'm sure it would be a wonderful pairing in a gym. Sign up for memberships and push eachother to achieve your goals.<br>  <br>  *Edit* I'm not saying anything negative about Leo's at all, I'm just not really compatable in relationships with them. Even though I'm a pisces, the one's I've dated have been far too sappy, even for this hopeless romantic. But y'all are coo peeps!|`|4f38qGoNaa	Nope.<br>  Pisces is too emotional. One minute he'll adore you, and then the next he'll hate you for not giving him all the attention he wants. He'll throw tantrums, and you probably wont even sweat it cus us leos just dont do that... but it'll only make things worse. He'll be mean for no reason at all, and you won't see it coming, nor will you understand it... and he probably won't either... it'll just piss you off, but you being pissed off will in turn hurt his feelings. He'll be looking for you to make things better as u always do, but we're just not that easy. He'll end up getting on your last nerve over the smallest things and you'll probably leave his *** because the nagging, the mood swings and theatrics will just be too much|`|xsJZOdfEaa	At first yes however once the excitment has worn off, Leo's fire will be put out by the piece's water.|`|u1XplU3Xaa	Yes I think that is a good match.|`|plBXp91Daa	It is possible if you give it a chance and don't base everything on horoscope.|`|YtAkmjoyaa	It can why not, might take time though, Pisces can give the Leo a little more sensitivity and the Leo can give the Pisces a little ego boost. The Pisces is mutable, so he could probably mold into the Leo's dream man. Leo can also give Pisces what they love, loyalty and commitment. Leos are very caring too. Though they might hurt the Pisces heart, if the Leo is being TOO sarcastic. (I'm a Sagittarius and sometimes my Leo best/close friend hurt me with her sarcasm! but I get over it quick)|`|RnHDnSgPaa	here you go<br>  <br>  <br>   Pisces may at first seem to need protecting, or Mothering, and this could be the attraction for Leo.  Leo will get a big surprise when Pisces suddenly becomes positive and takes the actions necessary on his/her own behalf.  If Leo persists, and involves him or herself with unstable Pisces in a long term relationship; this can have drastic effects on Leo, as Leo always likes to know exactly where he/she stands in any situation.   Both are vain, and both share the love of extravagant clothing, but that is about as far as the sharing will go.<br>  <br>      Pisces is generous with love and attention, but on occasions will turn Leo off and retreat into a small quiet world all his/her own while he/she works out a problem or makes a solitary decision.  Leo will feel puzzled, hurt, left out, and frustrated at this kind of treatment.  Leo is apt to throw him/herself into a round of parties and friends in order to combat those feelings which in turn puzzles and irritates Pisces.   In this relationship it is Leo who will wind up deeply hurt, and a nervous wreck as the ability of Pisces to put that well known Piscean intuition to work can disconcert Leo, as Leo will have no secrets from this person.<br>  <br>      The bedroom activities could make or break this union as both are highly sexed and will enjoy the time spent together here.  To keep Leo happy, Pisces must learn to control his/her changeable moods and keep them out of their lovelife, and if Leo can accept a weaker sign as a mate then it might work out.  Definitely not a match made in Heaven. <br>  <br>  <br>  Im a picese and i get along with taures!!<br>  they are very caring! pices are very emotional and need someone like tht|`|PA7kYyAxaa	could be problematic when the taurus is in the minor position ties year. consider an option of using the negative impact as a lender.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Except at the Good Omens holistic gym and spa.

Ent?o resolvi amarrar a pickup no trem que estava passando no momento, o trem puxou a pickup,  que puxou o cavalo e que puxou o peixe...<br>  - Eta, só assim que você conseguiu?<br>  > - Bem, o peixe n?o consegui tirar n?o, mas que acabei entortando o rio... Ah! isso eu consegui!!!<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  O fazendeiro resolve trocar o seu velho galo por outro que desse conta das inúmeras galinhas. Ao chegar o novo galo e, percebendo que perderia suas fun??es, o velho galo foi conversar com o seu substituto:<br>  - Olha, sei que já estou velho e é por iisso que o meu dono te trouxe aqui, mas será que você poderia deixar pelo menos duas galinhas para mim?<br>  - Que é isso, velhote?! Vou ficar com tttodas.<br>   Mas só duas... - ainda insistiu o galo.<br>  - N?o. Já disse! S?o todas minhas!<br>  - Ent?o vamos fazer o seguinte: - prop?e o galo velho - apostamos uma corrida em volta do galinheiro. Se eu ganhar, fico com pelo menos duas galinhas. Se eu perder, s?o todas suas.<br>  O galo jovem mede o galo velho de cima abaixo e pensa que certamente ele n?o será capaz de vence-lo:<br>  - Tudo bem, velhote, eu aceito.<br>  - Já que realmente minhas chances s?o poucas, deixe-me ficar vinte passos a frente. - pediu o galo.<br>  O mais jovem pensou por uns instantes e aceitou as condi??es do galo velho.<br>  Iniciada a corrida, o galo jovem dispara para alcan?ar o outro galo.<br>  O galo velho faz um esfor?o danado para manter a vantagem, mas rapidamente está sendo alcan?ado pelo mais jovem. No momento em que o mais velho ia ser alcan?ado pelo mais novo, o fazendeiro pega sua espingarda e atira sem piedade no galo jovem.<br>  - Guardando a arma, comenta com a mulheeer:<br>  - Num t? intendendo, uai! Já é o quinto galo viado que a gente compra esta semana!<br>  <br>  B?o dimais , né?...|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	O Caipira e seus 3 Porquinhos<br>  <br>  <br>  Em um ?nibus que passava por Minas, com destino ao Rio de Janeiro, entrou um caipira com três porcos a tira-colo.

3nZ8l8Jyaa	Hmm.....after being suspended again by Yahoo, I can't remember what number account that was now, I wanted to make a statement. I was tired of playing nice and losing my accounts because of trolls. The avatar represents me doing the spanking this time and not the trolls or Yahoo. It also shows a little of my sexuality too.|`|gUdFFYNTaa	My avatar says i like Dani Filth, and one of my favorite bands are nicknamed "The Helsinki Vampires" and "dead until dark" is a lyric from one of their songs that I absolutely love. <br>   So mostly it reflects my love for music, and pretty much my lifestyle; music, music, and more music.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	I change it occasionally from a skull head to one with some meat on it.

Lá eles tem comida e prote??o!!! Na minha opini?o eles também tem que acabar, porque digo isso, porque apesar de darem comida e "prote??o", eu acho que eles estariam mais felizes no seu habitat natural, imagina trancarem um ser humano em uma cela pra vida toda, mas ele vai ter café da manh? caprichado, almo?o de primeira, café da tarde, janta e nessa sua cela vai ter, televis?o com DVD e muitos filmes para se ver e TV a cabo, videogame Play Station 2 ou o 3 com vários jogos, som, computador com Internet Velox, cama com colch?o dágua bem macio, ar condicionado, um banheiro com vaso de porcelana, banheira de hidromassagem, os humanos iriam querer essa vida???

Entre três deusas maravilhosas, n?o tem como escolher só uma, ent?o, o que eu posso fazer é escolher baseado no trabalho delas, que também n?o fica atrás uma da outra. Eu n?o descartaria o trabalho de sua xará como atriz só por, digamos, ela ser a mais jovem e ter menos experiência, quando isso nem de longe é verdade. Ela já se destacava na TV desde pequena e foi na TV que ela se consagrou com a série "Dark Angel" que, antes que metam o pau, era dirigida e produzida pelo próprio James "Titanic" Cameron! Quanto aos filmes, cada uma delas tem um currículo que dispensa comentários! Mas, já que eu tenho que optar por uma, fico com Catherine.

A das 21:00 ainda n?o vi nada deste tipo, mas as demais sim. Veja bem, s?o vários públicos que assisitem. Cada um tem uma opini?o diferente sobre esse tipo da assunto. Acredito que esses tipos de religi?es n?o deveriam ser t?o utilizadas nestas novelas. A novela em sim foi criada simplesmente para divertir, emocionar etc e n?o para mostrar ocultismos, feiti?aria entre outras práticas.|`|CGm3GM1Waa	pq ela é feita pra gente imbecil|`|OdmxNLkwaa	O mal que as novelas fazem  <br>      <br>   <br>  <br>  Certa vez, um amigo chamado Franz Victor, psicólogo já falecido, disse-me que "as novelas fazem uma prega??o sistemática de antivalores". Embora isso já fa?a bastante tempo, eu nunca esqueci esta frase. Meu amigo me disse uma grande verdade. <br>  <br>  <br>  Enquanto a evangeliza??o procura incutir nas pessoas uma vida de acordo com os valores do Evangelho, a maioria das novelas estraga as pessoas, incutindo-lhes antivalores crist?os. <br>  <br>  <br>  As novelas, em sua maioria, exploram as paix?es humanas, muito bem espelhadas nos chamados pecados capitais: soberba, ganancia, luxúria, gula, ira, inveja e pregui?a; e faz delas objeto dos seus enredos, estimulando o erro e o pecado, mas de maneira requintada. <br>  <br>  Na maioria delas vemos a exacerba??o do sexo; explora-se descaradamente este ponto, desvirtuando o seu sentido e o seu uso. Em muitas cenas, podem ser vistos casais n?o casados vivendo a vida sexual, muitas vezes, de maneira explícita, acintosa e provocante. E isso no horário em que as crian?as e os jovens est?o na sala. Aquilo que um casal casado tem direito de viver na sua intimidade, é colocado a público de maneira despudorada, ferindo os bons costumes e os mandamentos de Deus. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mas tudo isso é apresentado de uma maneira "inteligente", com uma requintada técnica de imagens, som, música, e um forte aparato de belas mulheres e rapazes que prendem a aten??o dos telespectadores e os transforma em verdadeiros viciados. Em muitas famílias já n?o se faz nada na hora da novela, nem mesmo se dá aten??o aos que chegam, aos filhos ou aos pais. <br>  <br>  <br>  Assim, os valores crist?os v?o sendo derrubados um a um: a humildade, o desprendimento, a pureza, a continência, a mansid?o, a bondade, o perd?o, entre outros; eles v?o sendo jogados por terra, mas de maneira homeopática; de forma que, aos poucos, lentamente, para n?o chocar, os valores morais v?o sendo suprimidos. Faz-se apologia do sexo a qualquer instante e sem compromisso familiar ou conjugal; aprova-se e estimula-se o homossexualismo como se fosse algo natural e legítimo, quando o Catecismo da Igreja Católica (CIC) chama a prática homossexual de "deprava??o grave" (CIC §2357). <br>  <br>  <br>  O roteiro e enredo dos dramas das novelas s?o cuidadosamente escolhidos de modo a enfocar os assuntos mais ligados às pessoas e às famílias, mas, infelizmente, a solu??o dos problemas é apresentada de maneira nada crist?. O adultério é muitas vezes incentivado de maneira sofisticada e disfar?ada, buscando-se quase sempre "justificar" um triangulo amoroso ou uma trai??o. <br>  <br>  <br>  O telespectador é quase sempre envolvido por uma trama em que um terceiro surge na vida de um homem ou de uma mulher, casados, que já est?o em conflito com seus c?njuges. A cena é formada de modo a que o telespectador seja levado a até desejar que o adultério se consuma por causa da "maldade" do c?njuge traído. <br>  <br>  <br>  E assim, a novela vai envolvendo e "fazendo a cabe?a" até mesmo dos crist?os. A conseqüência disso é que elas passaram a ser a grande formadora dos valores e da mentalidade da maioria das pessoas, de modo que os comportamentos - antes considerados absurdos -, agora já n?o o s?o, porque as novelas tornaram o pecado "palatável". O erro vai se transformando em algo comum e perdendo a sua conota??o de pecado. <br>  <br>  <br>  Por outro lado, percebe-se que a novela tira o povo da realidade de sua vida difícil fazendo-o sonhar diante da telinha. Nela, ele é levado a realizar o sonho que na vida real jamais terá condi??es de realizar: grandes viagens aéreas para lugares paradisíacos, casas superluxuosas com todo requinte de comidas, bebidas, carros, jóias, vestidos, luxo de toda sorte; fazendas belíssimas onde mulheres e rapazes belíssimos têm disputas entre si. <br>  <br>  <br>  E esses modelos de vida - recheados de falsos valores - s?o incutidos na cabe?a das pessoas. A conseqüência trágica disso é que a imoralidade prevalece na sociedade; a família é destruída pelos divórcios, trai??es e adultérios; muitos filhos s?o abandonados pelos pais, carregando uma carência que pode desembocar na tristeza, depress?o, bebida e até em coisas piores. A banaliza??o do sexo vai produzindo uma gera??o de m?es e pais solteiros, que mal assumem os filhos... é a destrui??o da família. <br>  <br>  <br>  Por tudo isso, o melhor que se pode fazer é proibir os filhos de acompanharem essas novelas. Contudo, os pais precisam ser inteligentes e saber substituí-las por outras atividades atraentes. N?o basta suprimir a novela; é preciso colocar algo melhor em seu lugar. Esta é uma miss?o urgente dos pais. <br>  <br>  FOTO ACIMA <br>  <br>  felipeaquino@cancaonova.com <br>  <br>  Prof. Felipe Aquino, casado, doutor em Física pela UNESP.

Acho que você já deve ter visto alguma novela do SBT, que se n?o for do México é extraída de lá (com excess?o de Chiquititas, que era Argentina). As da Record come?am com uma boa trama, mas se perdem nos seus 438.405.497.832 capítulos. N?o vou nem citar outras emissoras como Band e Rede TV... E n?o tem a menor dúvida que as novelas brasileiras s?o as melhores do mundo. O que eu acho é que tem muita novela (Vale a pena ver de novo, Malha??o, novela das seis, das sete, das nove), e atualmente n?o tem nenhuma com uma trama que n?o tenha sido usada pelo menos umas 10 vezes nas últimas novelas.

eab0876af200660754a6a92216f3aeaaaa	Por uma raz?o bem simples . é que o povo brasileiro n?o conhece coisa boa, ent?o qualquer porcaria que aparece em qualquer programa da Tv, eles acham que é a melhor coisa do mundo. O brasileiro tem mania de julgar o artista pela quantidade de vezes que ele aparece na Tv, ou quando toca a música no rádio, e n?o pela qualidade ou competência. Se vc ligar a Tv com certeza vc verá Bregalypso ( brega + calypso) várias vezes.

A música é ruim, a letra é ruim, a vocalista canta mal pra caramba. N?o consigo entender como conseguem vender tanto. Vai ver é porque caiu no gosto popular. Pov?o gosta deste tipo de música (sem ofensas, claro!)<br>  Aqui em Curitiba, no centro, na Pra?a Osório, tem vários músicos que se apresentam na rua. Vou citar dois exemplos:<br>  1 - Um guitarrista argentino. O cara tem um dom de dar inveja. Ele toca qualquer música que você pedir. Toca November Rain do Gun N' Roses que é uma beleza e sem ler as cifras. Ele tem dois cd's gravados, que ele comercializa. Quando você passa tem umas 5 ou 6 pessoas assistindo.<br>  2 - Uma dupla, ao estilo de Caju e Castanha, que fica falando versos com rimas e na sua maioria é besteira e coisas de duplo sentido. Cada um com um instrumento que eles ficam batendo na m?o para fazer o ritmo (esqueci o nome do dito instrumento). Tem um multid?o imensa que pára assistir e saem dando risada.<br>  Essa é a cultura do povo brasileiro.<br>  Lembra a cantora Vanessa Jackson, ganhadora da 1a edi??o do Fama??? A mulher tem um dom invejável. Seus agudos s?o divinos e perfeitos. E cadê a mo?a??? Nenhuma gravadora investe nela porque ela n?o vende. E Ivete Sangalo??? E Ana Carolina??? Vendem CD como se fosse água e n?o cantam lá grande coisa. (desculpem-me os f?s das cantoras, mas esta é minha opini?o.)

Ent?o, posso te fazer uma pergunta?<br>  - Claro meu filho... Qual é a pergunta?<br>  - O que é “Política”, pai?<br>  - Bem, vou usar a nossa casa como exemplo. Sou eu quem traz dinheiro para casa, ent?o sou o “Capitalismo”. Sua m?e administra (gasta) o dinheiro, ent?o ela é “Governo”. Como nos cuidamos das suas necessidades, ent?o você é o “Povo”. A empregada é a “Classe Trabalhadora”, e seu irm?o nenê é o “Futuro”. Entendeu, meu filho?<br>  - Mais ou menos, pai. Vou pensar...<br>  Naquela noite, acordado pelo choro do irm?o nenê, o menino foi ver o que tinha de errado. Descobriu que o pequeno tinha sujado a fralda e estava todo emporcalhado.<br>  Foi ao quarto dos pais e a sua m?e estava num sono muito pesado.<br>  Ent?o, foi ao quarto da empregada e viu, através da fechadura, o pai na cama com ela.<br>  Como os dois estavam muito empolgados, nem percebiam as batidas que o menino dava na porta. O garoto desistiu, voltou para o quarto e dormiu.<br>  Na manh? seguinte, na hora do café, ele falou para o pai:<br>  - Pai, agora acho que entendi o que é “Política”!<br>  - ótimo, filho! Ent?o me explica nas suas palavras...<br>  - Bom, pai, enquanto o “Capitalismo” f.o.d.e. a “Classe Trabalhadora”, o “Governo” dorme profundamente; o “Povo” é totalmente ignorado e o “Futuro” está todo c.a.g.a.d.o!|`|04984a64b7066d667fb48c7164e03c4eaa	Gostei!!!!

Vai custar uma fortuna para consertar. <br>  Mal termina a frase, ela dá a tacada e estilha?a uma vidra?a. <br>  O marido se desespera: - Eu disse para tomar cuidado! - E agora, como vai ser? -Vamos até lá pedir desculpas e ver quanto vai ser o prejuízo. <br>  Eles batem à porta e ouvem uma voz: - Podem entrar. <br>  Eles abrem a porta e vêem vidro espalhado pelo ch?o e uma garrafa quebrada perto da lareira.<br>  Um homem sentado no sofá diz: -Vocês s?o os que quebraram a minha janela? <br>  - Sim. Sentimos muito e pagaremos o prejuízo - responde o <br>  marido.<br>  - De jeito nenhum. Eu que quero agradecer-lhes. Sou um gênio que estava preso nesta garrafa há milhares de anos. Vocês me libertaram. Posso conceder três desejos. Eu dou um desejo a cada um e guardo o terceiro para mim. <br>  - Que legal! - diz o marido. - Quero um milh?o de dólares por ano, pelo resto de minha vida.<br>  -Sem problema. é o mínimo que eu posso fazer. E você, o que <br>  gostaria de pedir? - diz o gênio olhando para a esposa.<br>  - Quero uma casa em cada país do mundo, ela responde.<br>  - Pode considerar seu desejo realizado - diz o gênio.<br>  - E qual é seu desejo, gênio? - o marido pergunta. <br>  - Bem, desde que fiquei preso nesta garrafa n?o tive mais a oportunidade de fazer sexo. Meu desejo é ter sexo com sua mulher. <br>  O marido olha para sua esposa e diz: - Bem, querida, nós ganhamos um monte de dinheiro e todas essas casas. Acho que ele n?o está pedindo muito. <br>  O gênio leva a mulher para o quarto e passa duas horas com ela. <br>  Depois de terminar, ao se vestirem, o gênio olha para ela e pergunta:<br>  - Quantos anos tem seu marido? <br>  - 35. <br>  - E você?<br>  - 29.<br>  - P. que pariu!

Nc637a6laa	Me!!  Homemade Pizza cannot be beat and You definitely cannot get any fresher.  I make my own sauce and use portabello mushrooms (which are sooo good) and I put on  extra cheese without having to worry about the pizza place short changing me even when I ask for extra (and this happens a lot).  I can add any ingredient I wish and boy do I wish.  I like my pizza's with Italian sausage, lots of pepperoni, mini meatballs, ham, black olives, red onions, and of course I make my own crust which comes out so flakey and melts in your mouth like butter.  Our family and friends beg me to make it for them all the time, so I keep at least 6 in my freezer for just that reason. I really don't mind making homemade pizza's and they have been rated amongst our family and friends against all the best places and everyone says mine are the best.

Xww9vGWPaa	No, you're not being too hard at all. It's straight-up absurd what teenage girls will eat up. The author took one of the coolest subjects in literature and saturated it with shirtless, underage boys to the point where the reader forgets the book is about vampires. I'm completely and utterly sick of all these trends that are strung over every television, shopping mall, and freshman girls' english folder. If I ever run into a person wearing a Jonas Brothers t-shirt, reading Twilight, while humming along to some pathetic excuse for music (cough, cough...Katy Perry), I will have no choice but to end myself.|`|elLgFNkiaa	The movie was dissapointing to say the least,<br>  I feel like you are really right about the movie but harsh overall.<br>  <br>  The books are absolutely fantastic... I love to read and even though its a simple read its engaging and catching and she really was able to give the characters a feeling that made you fall in love with every one of them.<br>  Everyone likes it because its such a storybook perfect love story.  Every girl thinks they aren't perfect like Bella is portrayed and end up with the fairy tale prince charming like Edward and have eternity with them due to immortality, with an amazing best friend like Jacob.|`|cYgxTWDVaa	Since you somehow put this in the R&P section, might as well give an answer related to this.<br>  <br>  For the movie, it's probably because of Paramore.<br>  <br>  The book, well it is targeted towards teens and we all know that even if it's not THAT good as long as the majority of teens feel like they can relate to it then it IS good for them. And so they love it.<br>  <br>  Same concept for mainstream music and artists like katy perry, etc.<br>  <br>  It's a phase. It's not quality anymore. As long as it pleases a lot of people.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Lil Kristy is right, Anne Rice who wrote the Lestat, Queen of the Damned, Interview with the Vampire, ect. books is so much better you can't compare the two, Twilight will be forgotten in a couple years.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	you are correct.that series of books intended reader is teenage females.it might come as a surprise,but there are also books out there that target other demographics as well.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	not everyone likes it ahem.|`|Kb9VusIfaa	i personally think twilight is stupid. i have no idea y everyone loves it|`|qJpIh2iiaa	no your totally right<br>  i didnt even know they had a book|`|sORJIVlXaa	Teen pop phase that will fade off only to come back in 15 years with something similar or worse.<br>  <br>  Back in my day the rage was Hanson, Goosebumps, MTV TRL, Sugar Ray, Boy Bands, and the Spice Girls.|`|WKpiqj4baa	People like Twilight because it's nonthreatening pseudoerotica.|`|YbmklSzGaa	Why is this in the Rock and Pop section?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, okay :)<br>  Well I hate Twilight.

I have much less respect for these certain artist now.|`|NFb9IWnoaa	I hate the Jonas Brothers,<br>  I guess people like the twilight books cause they're personal.<br>  Well that's why I like them, because it's almost like a diary and it let's you know everything about every character and every emotion.<br>  Although, as much as I love it I do realise it's poorly written and the characters aren't really developed.. :S<br>  <br>  I liked Twilight a long time before it became massive, some people now just like it to conform or fit in with the conversation in a way. Those people are annoying|`|Zxl8oyIraa	HELL NO! i am sick of all this twilight talk.

You love magic and mystery and people are naturally drawn to you. You love to be the leader and tend to make a great one. You treat your friends as if they are family; however, you only share you secrets with one or two very special people whom you trust completely. A Scorpio will always forgive - but will never forget. Once you break the trust of a Scorpio, things are never the same again.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are often seen as secretive because you don't spill the beans to everyone. Friends want to get to know you, but you won't open up and share things with them until they fully gain your trust. You are often seen as moody and insulting - especially when you are bored. Be careful that you don't hurt someone's feelings the next time you roll your eyes!|`|rcEq136naa	It's a zodiac sign, and also the former last name of "Robin Scorpio" on General Hospital!

Try playing it through a different amp and/or a different cord to isolate those as the issues.<br>  <br>  Also, remember, that single coil pick-ups have a certain level of buzz all on their own - you can usually tell this if the buzz stops when you are touching the strings.|`|FUwnW9Mtaa	If you play it through a different amp and still have a buzzing, then it's a guitar issue.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldn’t see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldn’t sleep through class. He hadn’t been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasn’t my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, “Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.” His reply’ Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said “It’s all good.”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/story/it-wasnt-my-fiance-at-all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...</a>|`|Zc7H10w3aa	I tripped and fell in front of my class at school, but it wasn't my fault, some stupid girl stuck her foot out, and tripped me on purpose.|`|XctMTPisaa	I was talking to this girl i really liked on the sidewalk and got into this story I was telling her which was 90% false and walked head first into a sign pole.

I really liked the character development and it wasn't quite 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is about as short as I could see them making a movie of this scale. Having not read the graphic novel, I do conceed most of later sceens really confused me as to whether they should inspire hope or despair. I can say that the graphics and visuals blew me away and the story definitely was able to keep hold of my attention the entire length of the movie.|`|xNZ8ZZyxaa	Agreed.  Absolute waste of time - time I will never get back for sure.  I, too, was suckered into watching that garbage.  I had a bad feeling from the start and knew I should have gone with my gut feeling. Absolutely ridiculous plot.  It doesn't make sense at all.  Stupid characters, but I have to concede there was good development like one of the answerers here mentioned.  But stupid nonetheless.  I would have forgiven the crazy characters if there was at least one awesome villain.  None at all!  I truly hate this film with a passion, more so because of its political agenda.|`|DXtyMRLuaa	Not to be insulting because I believe the marketing is somewhat misleading but if you had researched the film first you would had known its not like a typical hero movie, its very spot on to the book. I loved it personally.|`|pMaMO9Olaa	I would have to say the best part of t he movie was its previews.as soon as I walk out the theater I looked at my friend and said "man that sucked" People started to throw popcorn and booing at the end. (SERIOUSLY) what a let down|`|2ot1qKxsaa	I agree to a certain point. I liked the main idea. The theme was different and interesting. What I didn't like was the acting. The characters seemed blan and boring. They didn't have much emotion. Only when something extreme happened. Which is really easy to play when the scene calls for an extreme emotion. I honestly did feel like i wasted my money. The comic is better.|`|VeYpByfZaa	THE MOVIE SUCKED! GIVEN THE CHOICE OF WATCHING IT OR GETTING A RAILROAD SPIKE DRIVEN INTO MY HAND SLOWELY, I GLADLY REACH MY ARM OUT!<br>  <br>  This was a total let down, the only thing I thought was good was the actor playing Rorschach. he looked and acted like in the graphic novel.<br>  <br>  I definently want my friggin money back!!!!|`|goFmr33Eaa	i think anyone who hasn't read the comics or was expecting a batman/superman-like film is going to be unpleasantly surprised because of how different the movie AND comic are from others.|`|RKwpmZfeaa	omg grow up it was amazin!!! wat do u espect the comic was filthy so the movie would be too. i hate to see wat you call a good movie|`|8922575de58c3bdb3c9e239f6dddb3cfaa	Yes, that movie was beyond hopeless.

P6xuhlgTaa	Its easy to answer knowing how Jump works. Their magazine owns Naruto and Bleach serialisation.<br>  They always put the manga with the more fans/votes, chance to earn them money  in first. Only the small gag mangas place in the magazine don't depend of their success, vote and fan base<br>  <br>  And in Jump the order is actually One piece/Naruto/Bleach when you read the magazine and looking votes and reasons for subscriptions Bleach have a long way to go be at the same level than Naruto. If you ask Jump to choose between the 2 they ll just stop edit Bleach and continue Naruto serialisation without even thinking about it<br>  One Piece is more family like the mother and her son reading/watching it. Bleach is the less family like  of the 3 so its quite normal they get a smaller fan base than others cause mostly boys. <br>  Its the same with the channel,day and time of the animé diffusion in japan showing how Naruto comes before Bleach in fan bases just looking price of advertisements spaces during the adds cut.<br>  Bleach just suffers from the diversification of his fan base like having the biggest young boys fanbase but last for others statistic.Shonens are drawns for youngs boys but there aren't the first to buy them or subscribe for shonen magazine^^ so they lack powers to decide how actual and future shonens will be.<br>   Being like by a lot of different people doesn't mean a manga is better than another one but its harder for a mangaka to complete.<br>  Thats why producers ll easily spend cash for a One Piece movie(like 10 already) people ll go see in family and are more reticent for a Bleach movie that have more chance to be a success only in Dvd. Companys uses a lot more naruto than bleach for publicity of their products like cornflakes and others for the same reasons<br>  <br>  Girls votes usually put Naruto front bleach and their vote decide if a shonen for boys will continue being serialized or not.Strange! but thats realistic in a capitalist economy<br>  <br>  First fan bases/sales in occident are just a joke to make editing and investments decisions cause a mangaka will need 2 years success as a manga in japan and at least 1 year success as an animé for the bests ones to have a chance to be shown to occidental editors and studios.Thats also a reason why there is so less black characters in mangas and why they will only appears after chapter 100 in a manga.<br>  Chapter 100=2 years edition= The manga is now sold in Occident so the mangaka adapt his manga to a worldwide fanbase(in Bleach Yoruichi human appearance is shown in chapter 130 and Hachibi after 400+ chapter in Naruto)<br>  <br>  In manga first buyers are girls in asia and they decide of the market^^ 90% shojos and 65% shonens are bought by girls. Girls are always first to vote even for shonen in Jumpand they also are first for Jump yearly subscriptions even if Jump is meant to be a shonen magazine for boys.Also 2/3 mangakas are girls/women... I know its quite different in occident but the real cash for mangas is in japan and asia<br>  <br>  <br>  You can try to read "Bakuman" to understand how manga serialisation work in a fun and entertaining way. Its a new manga about mangas/magazine and animés world by the mangakas of Death Note|`|zA1dEHkKaa	I think once they make Naruto Shippuden with the english dub it will get some of its fans back. But honestly I think they are going to kill it in the english dub. They are gonna make it look kiddish. But Bleach it also very popular, so i really don't know.|`|TcS1YyxIaa	For the fans, I think that would be Naruto.

Because its aired on Cartoon Network and that is where most kids watch Naruto.  For Bleach its aired on Adult Swim so most kids don't get to watch Bleach.|`|lrVbZdSDaa	I'd actually guess that Naruto has more fans.  I haven't looked at any statistics though.

HJ5mYp5faa	He's probably looking for someone who doesn't need an overly emotionally demonstrative partner because he most likely won't be the guy who's up on PDAs etc.  He'll look for a partner who won't hound or nag him and will give him his space.  <br>  <br>  He'll want someone that is affectionate and supportive that can appreciate his dry sense of humor.  He'll be slow to trust you for fear of getting hurt or abandon.  He will probably want to be the head of household completely.  He thrives for absolutely the best so if disappointed, he'll run a guilt trip that would rival your mother.<br>  <br>  Once Lunar Capricorns make the decision to commit, they love wholly and completely, they are steadfast and generous and giving.

tuATxHsVaa	The best "method book" for easy sight reading practice is a hymn book from a church. Doesn't really matter which one, just make sure it is huge and full of keyboard music. I find those are the best way to practice sight reading. There's a million little pieces in there for you to look at with fresh eyes. Eventually you will grow out of it, but probably long before you have sight read all the pieces. <br>  <br>  As far as your question goes, I am unsure about what to tell you. Playing with your hands separately is good practice, but doesn't fully prepare you for sight reading pieces with both hands. <br>  <br>  Now, it is excellent practice to play with the hands separately. Don't get me wrong. I am just not sure that this is going to prepare you for sight reading with both hands. Sight reading with both hands requires an ability to play while studying the score. You need to learn to read ahead of the music you are playing, always preparing for the next notes. It's like chess. You must think 4 moves ahead. The only way to really learn that is to just start doing it. If you play one hand at a time, you are learning to play the piano properly - but I wouldn't say this will necessarily translate into sight reading ability - not yet.<br>  <br>  How long have you played the piano? There's no reason to worry about your sight reading ability if you've only been playing for a year or two - even three. Sight reading will develop as you mature. Even great pianists like Alfred Brendel will openly admit that they are terrible sight readers and have always been. What is important is that you learn to develop pieces for concert use. Your performance ability on the piano is what is important. You won't be sight reading pieces at performance venues.<br>  <br>  As your playing gets more complicated, you have to acquire more and more music. The complete sonatas of C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, J.C. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Clementi, D. Scarlatti, and others, are a good start. Eventually, you should have a bookcase full of piano works. You will sometimes pull a few out and sight read a new work or two. This is how you practice sight reading at a mature level. After you have sight read many works, you might decide to work on one seriously. That is what sight reading is mostly about. For the most part, your playing will be based on loads of practice and will have nothing to do with sight reading; but, you will surely develop the ability in time if you keep practicing diligently.<br>  <br>  Another huge component of sight reading has to do with the recognition of patters. That is why older players tend to be such amazing sight readers. After 20 or 30 years of practice, you have seen a lot of musical patterns and played them millions of times. Therefore, you can effortlessly play them. Younger sight readers are often seeing these patterns for the first time! You can't expect to easily execute something that you have never even seen before in music.<br>  <br>  So, as you can see, a lot of it just come with age.<br>  <br>  One of the great sight readers was Lukas Foss - he died earlier this month, I believe. RIP. He could sight read orchestral scores brilliantly. One time at UCLA some students didn't believe him and so they acquired some scores that they knew he hadn't seen - and he sight read them perfectly from the orchestral score.|`|sc4BtGxGaa	If you search the completed questions, you will see several answers that I answered at length about piano sight-reading.  Yes, some of my suggestions involve using a hymnal, but NOT as straight-up two-hands sightreading!  See if you can find these - they were within the last 2 or 3 months.<br>  <br>  This is a VITAL skill, and once you get good at it, whole world of accomplishment and FUN open up - learning new music is no longer a struggle.|`|qswrz268aa	Sure. <br>  <br>  But at some point you have to make the switch... Try sight reading really easy songs at first that you can sightread flawlessly. Then work your way up. A method book might be fun to sightread in, like Piano Adventures, or Alfred... <br>  <br>  Good luck! You'll be able to sight read like Liszt someday if you keep working. <br>  <br>  Cheerio|`|Vv7IvSEjaa	When sight reading always start from the lowest note up. Two hand sightreading will then become automatic.<br>  <br>  I have a stack of music. I sightread a new piece every day. No matter how difficult it might be no matter how slowly I play it. This works!|`|pGsX9Juiaa	just by trying to sight read easy pieces with both hands to start with<br>  as long as you can sight read the bass clef then you should be able to with most pieces your standard eventually|`|arPyfVUDaa	Yeah.  Start off with real simple stuff. You'll get to the Chopin and all of that eventually. Good luck|`|AA10248966	One of the more toguth things humans can do is sightread music with two hands on the piano of a substantial nature. Yes, hands separately reading helps us reinforce already learned passages and patterns.

AA10125474	A lot of Joplin's rags, including this one, are also marked "not too fast" -- which could mean anything.  But I personally like it at a march tempo -- the syncopations and right hand detail come out so much better.  <br>  <br>  Pedal VERY sparingly, if at all.  If you must, pedal on the downbeat, but get off of it as quick as you can.  Give the piece some bounce and clarity.That's my opinion -- there are hundreds of others, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|jbAr62ybaa	I agree with "glinzek" for the most part.  To use the pedal sparingly, is an understatement; many beginning students employee this - over use - as a means to cover up their lack of technical skills: use, apply only when it's absolutely clear that's its a necessity.<br>  <br>       But I disagree with him regarding "but not to fast".  I don't know whether Joplin or another was responsible for this cautionary notation; this piece seems to elicit in most, an urge to play it faster and faster: it's sort of like a narcotic.<br>  <br>       Performing this piece, presents a vastly different experince than just listening to it; a pianist should always keep in mind, that their audience's reaction is more important ultamitely than their own; and it's been my experience - just listening to, and not performing it - I always prefer renditions that are taken at a "not to fast" tempo.<br>  <br>       This is a piano roll of the composer himself playing his masterpiece:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMAtL7n_-rc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMAtL7n_-...</a><br>  <br>       Now this rendition I feel is going overboard - way, way to slow(blaringly loud; probably want to turn down the volume):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX2t-qZJkrc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX2t-qZJk...</a><br>  <br>       This one is too fast for my taste(trying to find one that's at what I consider to be a "most" enjoyable tempo):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uo49IYAx3s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uo49IYAx...</a><br>  <br>       Going to give up: can't find one that's taken at what I would consider to be a "best" tempo; but I think I prefer this one, over all the preceding ones - even that of the composer(notice how the pianist brings out the logic of the piece better, with his left hand):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYt87WlYhRw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYt87WlYh...</a><br>  <br>                                                   Alberich|`|AA12376180	Scott Joplin was a stubborn man. The Maple Leaf made him and his publisher quite a bit of money. Definitely his most popular rag.<br>  <br>  As time went by and other pianist started writing rags and the trend was changing to play faster tempos, his style began to wain in popularity and in self defense he began marking all of his rags with "Do not play fast, it is never right to play ragtime fast". He refused to go with the flow so to speak.<br>  <br>  Like Mozart, he outlived the popularity of his music and watched the public move on to new ideas.

AbRfd29Haa	That's his face... not simply his mask, man! <br>  <br>  In the novel, it was actually two layers of latex, with a black viscous fluid between the layers... kind of a lava-lamp in fabric. This had originally been in a dress for Kitty Genovese, a woman who was brutally murdered, possibly in full view of many neighbors. Walter Kovacs, prior to his full transformation into Rorshach, worked in the dress shop that made that dress, and after her murder, they had no use for this weird dress, so Kovacs took it home and made himself a "face that he could look at in the mirror" out of it... that's also when he started into "Masked Adventuring". <br>  <br>  Of course, his face also moves in response to his emotion, which never is fully explained. And it maintains symmerty, like an inkblot, also without explanation... other than perhaps a suggestion that it's more than just a mask. And the never-mixing black and white represents his world view: there's good, there's evil, no shades of grey... that's ultimately his downfall, but also why the prision was full of his enemies even years after "Masked Aventureres" were outlawed. <br>  <br>  Of course, in the film, its a special effect.

5GW5xGCwaa	If you like Golden Skans a DJ called Sebastian does the f*ckin sickest remix ever of that song I'm sure you can find it on youtube.  And he is crazy talented.<br>  <br>  Calvin Harris is dope as hell too.  If you like him I'm willing to put money on LCD Soundsystem working out.  Check out his songs North American Scum and Daft Punk is Playing at My House.  You should check out CSS, Boys Noize, Chromeo, MSTRKRFT, The Bloody Beetroots, Deadmau5, Digitalism, Simian Mobile Disco, Busy P.  They are all electro DJ's/producers/musicians.  I'm a fiend for their music, they are all amazing.  Everything they do is the coolest music ever and I would make babies with all of them.  I've seen them all live.  I could talk about them forever and think everyone should hear them at least once.  <br>  <br>  You should get every album Beck has made because he is the sh*t and you want to smell it.  He does a range of stuff from dance-y tunes to mellow acoustic songs since you like Coldplay and dance music I think you'd dig him.|`|GfLwOZHFaa	blink-182|`|Vv5vAgqPaa	Check out the New Zealand group Concord Dawn, they've got a website - just google their name.

m0Ws985gaa	I think it's a little bit Queen heavy, especially since some of the songs go on for quite a while. Just seems like there is maybe two Queen songs too many. And maybe throw something a little less mainstream in, you know, something not everyone in the crowd will have heard already :P<br>  Edit: If that's the case then the set looks fine.|`|5GW5xGCwaa	1, 2, 4, and 5 while all awesome songs are played way. too. much.  It's sad because they are classics.  But they are outplayed as hell.  If I had to watch you do a cover of these songs in concert I would roll my eyes, go out to my car and smoke a bowl til you finished singing them.  But that is just my opinion.  Some people will never get tired of those songs no matter how many times the radio plays them or their friends play them on Guitar Hero or how many times they hear them at sporting events.|`|m3eFscuqaa	Awesome, those are really underground bands that you can get some exposure for! The audience won't have heard any of those songs before either, so you can afford to make some mistakes without them noticing. Good plan, definitely not cliché at all.|`|BxTAfd2baa	1-2-10-3-5-7-8-9-11-12-6-4 ish.  Just use this as guideline as a few of these songs i have never heard.

08ffae48fa13e912e9b289d01720dd26aa	Aqui está uma pergunta que eu também faria, pois também sou Libra. Dizem áries com Libra?! Só me pergunto como é que pode haver tal compatibilidade entre duas pessoas totalmente opostas!!<br>  <br>  Libra é diplomata, cuidadoso, justo, etc... Faz tudo para n?o passar por cima de ninguém. Já áries vai a 200 à hora e atropela tudo e todos sem o menor remor?o, só pensa em chegar onde quer. Isto é apenas um exemplo que ilustra as formas opostas de operar dos dois... Como é possível que se entendam um ao outro, e sobretudo, se amem?! N?o sei se acredito que os dois signos se completem. Acho antes que seria uma guerra constante em que as duas partes n?o se entenderiam...<br>  <br>  Acho que no meu caso ia para Aquário ou Touro, mas principalmente Aquário. Isto porque Libras e Aquários conversam muito e isso para mim tem toda a importancia. Já Touro tem o mesmo planeta regente que nós Libra - Vénus - e isso pode trazer vantagens por haver um entendimento parecido do amor.<br>  <br>  Gémeos também pode funcionar, porque tal como Libra e Aquário s?o signos de elemento Ar e daí podem vir afinidades maiores.<br>  <br>  Por outro lado, basta ter o mínimo de experiência para chegar à conclus?o de que entre pessoas do mesmo signo, há umas que adoramos e outras que detestamos... Já reparou? Para além do signo há o ascendente e o signo lunar... N?o se pode generalizar.<br>  <br>  Por isso vá onde o seu cora??o mandar e deixe este negócio para lá.<br>  <br>  P.S.: o meu ascendente é áries, talvez por isso seja uma pessoa um pouco imprevisível...|`|FX5tFutXaa	signo virgem,pois eu namoro com um libriano e nós combinamos em várias coisas.<br>  bjux|`|L7oapmL6aa	Touro|`|LedFLJG3aa	áries|`|PxQPW4SCaa	para namoro é:áries<br>  para amigos:gêmeos, aquario|`|f464b11ab98114c87072e332a8728dc6aa	Bom, em princípio, áries, le?o, sagitário e a própria libra também.<br>  Experiência de ariano.

Nesta rela??o o ariano terá sua energia impulsiva e dinamica direcionada pela sensatez de Libra, que terá total apoio para resolver suas quest?es e amenizará seu lado indeciso. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   TOURO<br>  Uma ótima combina??o. Regidos pelo mesmo planeta, Vênus, os dois viver?o momentos de intenso prazer. O interesse pela arte, beleza e estética comum aos dois, fará com que tenham momentos de lazer e felicidade permanente. O ciumento taurino pode estranhar um ser t?o aberto e sociável como Libra, mas a compreens?o mútua resolverá tudo. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   GêMEOS<br>  Uma afinidade intelectual marcante unirá estes dois signos. Há muitos interesses em comum, favorecendo uma constante troca de idéias e opini?es. Uma liga??o que tende a ser fraternal e aberta, sendo normalmente bastante compensadora. Nesta uni?o as emo??es e paix?es ser?o amenizadas, mas existirá amor entre os casais espiritualmente desenvolvidos l. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   CANCêR<br>  A reserva canceriana e a cordialidade libriana podem fazer com que esta rela??o seja mais de amizade do que de amor. Mais doméstico, o canceriano se sentirá inseguro com a sociabilidade e abertura com Libra se comporta com as pessoas. A rela??o pode se tornar monótona com o passar do tempo. Se houver compreens?o, poderá existir um grande amor <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   LE?O<br>  Dificilmente os librianos resistem aos galanteadores leoninos. A liga??o é quase imediata, podendo ir rapidamente da amizade para o amor. Haverá respeito mútuo e grande afinidade intelectual. O gosto pela arte pode levá-los a momentos prazerosos. O libriano pode sentir-se inseguro com o magnetismo de Le?o, mas a terá toda a aten??o de Le?o. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   VIRGEM<br>  Uma boa parceria. O único problema será a indecis?o libriana unida ao detalhismo virginiano que poderá levá-los a dificuldades de defini??o de objetivos. Profissionalmente podem obter resultados muito bons, unindo o sendo prático de Virgem com a vis?o estética e harm?nica característica de Libra. Superadas as dificuldades iniciais, será ótimo. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   LIBRA<br>  Uma rela??o harmoniosa e tranqüila. Mesmo depois da fase inicial de amor intenso, ainda resistirá ao tempo uma forte rela??o de amizade, o que os manterá juntos por muito tempo. Devem ter cuidado com a indecis?o, que pode prejudicar em momentos importantes na vida a dois. Pequenos problemas de comunica??o podem desgastar a rela??o. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   ESCORPI?O<br>  O ciúme doentio de Escorpi?o pode n?o se acostumar com a sociabilidade e abertura de Libra com as pessoas. As atitudes agressivas e a intensidade do escorpiano podem chocar o libriano. Mesmo assim, passadas as restri??es iniciais, o Escorpi?o pode levar o libriano a extravasar sua paix?o, fazendo o escorpiano sentir a leveza do grande amor. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   SAGITáRIO<br>  Uma uni?o que tende a ser muito prazerosa. Profissionalmente ser?o ótimos colaboradores. Sua vis?o ética da vida os faz caminharem numa mesma dire??o. Os momentos de amor tendem a ser muito intensos e cheios de romantismo. Abertos e francos, esses dois viver?o uma felicidade plena. O libriano deve ser menos inseguro com este livre e solto sagitariano <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   CAPRIC?RNIO<br>  Pode ser uma uni?o duradoura, se o romantico e amável libriano abrir m?o de um pouco sua necessidade de vida social. O racional e pessimista capricorniano pode abafar o brilho de Libra. Como é difícil n?o ceder aos encantos de Libra, o capricorniano tenderá a relaxar um pouco esse seu lado conservador e duro, mas dificilmente deixará de ter ciúmes. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   AQUáRIO<br>  Ao lado de um libriano o Aquário poderá ampliar seus la?os com as pessoas e viver melhor sua vida social. Uma rela??o que tende a fazer o libriano se divertir muito. O interesse pela arte, pela vida social e pela independência pode ser um elemento vitalizador da uni?o. Sexualmente pode ser uma rela??o sem muitas paix?es, mas pode ser proveitosa. <br>  <br>   LIBRA X   PEIXES<br>  O libriano pode encontrar em Peixes o verdadeiro amor e o romantismo tanto idealizado. Doces e romanticos, esses dois signos podem viver um grande amor. Libra, mais ponderado e equilibrado pode dar a seguran?a que o pisciano tanto precisa. Por mais que fique claro na rela??o a dedica??o libriana, o Peixes sempre terá ciúmes das amizades do libriano.|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	nao importa o signo,ams sim se a pessoa que estiver com vc combine.

Na pior das hipóteses, eu viria a autorizar a adapta??o de um dos livros que escrevi (e que falta publicar). A história é sobre o cotidiano, as aventuras e o bom-humor de uma típica família brasileira, tudo beirando para a comédia e o drama.<br>  <br>  Título: Os Schweib - Uma Família Bastante Familiar.<br>  Sinopse: Na distante Armenópolis, vivem Vladimir Schweib e sua família. Comp?em a família a esposa, Genoveva, os filhos, Marilu e Persival, o sobrinho, Raimundo, o gato de estima??o da família, Rosbife e Romildo, pai de Vladimir. O casal Schweib ainda tem uma afilhada, Flora Jacinto. Seus vizinhos s?o Os Chevales, cujo único filho namora Marilu. Ludovico Chevales, a esposa, úrsula e o filho, Nicanor levam um padr?o de vida n?o muito diferente do de seus vizinhos. Completam ainda o círculo de rela??es o Sr. Fabiano Flachen, chefe de Vladimir, sua esposa, Hortência e o filho do casal, Olegário. Em meio a um patr?o estressado e exigente e que paga mal, uma esposa que lhe tira do sério e ter de sustentar mais seis bocas além da sua, Vladimir Schweib vive aventuras e situa??es dignas das mais diversas gargalhadas.<br>  <br>  O nome Schweib é a fus?o das palavras Schwarzen e Wei?/Weiss (respectivamente, preto e branco em alem?o).<br>  <br>  E se interessar a você (n?o é nem um pedido, e sim um convite), pode acessar aos sites que falam sobre meus livros: <a href="http://osromanoz.vipflog.com.br" rel="nofollow">http://osromanoz.vipflog.com.br</a> e: <a href="http://osromanoz.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://osromanoz.spaces.live.com/</a> (Os Romanoz é o nome da banda que estrela a maioria dos meus livros).|`|el2MCYPUaa	a picara sonhadora|`|g6ZkY2kJaa	A vida como ela n?o é! mostraria o governo investindo em educa??o, empresários fazendo doa??es e fazendo patrocinios, pessoas pobres ficando ricos,justi?a sendo feita, e assim por diante,etc...quanta ironia..rsrs ia ser divertido!!|`|rOTh3hKoaa	Ah sei la....<br>  Falaria sobre um homem que sabia que ia morrer e decide fazer tudo q ele sempre quis fazer...<br>  Aí se desenvolveria toda a trama da historia...<br>  E no final ficaria a duvida se ele morria ou n?o...<br>  O nome seria:' Caminhando para as estrelas"<br>  Ou algo do genero...|`|4q2XSeJDaa	"Problemas e solu??es do dia-dia.<br>  Trataria da vida do ser humano em geral .<br>  BJS!!!|`|6x5Pa06daa	Quem é o maior bandido?

She then unleashed this horrible string of cusses directed toward me(i guess it was her time of the month or something).  I asked if her mother would want her talking like that and she said,"Boy, you do not talk about my moma"  I couldn't resist.  I replied with,"Yo moma's like a roller coaster, she's thrilling at first, but, at the end, she always makes me vomit."  WHACK!  Left a red mark that lasted for a good ten minutes.

7a95bd61252328f07e4dcb69175ab70eaa	I only have an answer for your first question. On youtube you can made picture by picture slideshows/videoclips without music. However if you made one and tried to upload it on youtube that has music on it (not produced by you), you won't be able to have that music since it is copywritten. Now the pictures you're wanting to make into a videoclip are they pictures you found on the internet? If so, I believe you can upload them with no problem because they have a filter letting them know what pictures are copywritten and what's not. Now if you want to add music to your videoclip, they have a selection of many different artists and songs you can possibly use. I would visit the youtube website and look at their copyright notices and community help forums to help you out.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Are you sure it isn't the opposite? There is a movie in which virgins are the target, not the usual sexually active teens in most slasher films.<br>  <br>  Cherry Falls (2000)<br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  In the woods outside the small affluent town of Cherry Falls, Virginia, a young teenage couple is getting romantic in a car when a female, black-haired killer appears and murders them both. Meanwhile, in town, teenager Jody Marken (Brittany Murphy) - the daughter of the local sheriff - is trying to deal with her boyfriend, Kenny (Gabriel Mann), who thinks it's time to go "all the way." Jody gently tells him 'no', then goes back home only to find her father, Brent (Michael Biehn), upset that she's out past curfew. Brent and his deputies begin to investigate the murders the next day. They see that that the killer carved the word "virgin" into both victims. At the high school, Brent runs into English teacher Mr. Marliston (Jay Mohr), who urges Brent to divulge more details of the murder to students and the town so as to eliminate the possibility of secrets. Soon enough, the female killer murders another teen~again targeting a virgin. Concerned for the town's safety, Brent holds a meeting at the high school to tell parents the nature of the crimes. (No students are invited, but Jody sneaks in.) The female killer appears and strikes at Jody, but her father rescues her. Word gets out in Cherry Falls about how virgins are being targeted.|`|APWFRGJkaa	lol, they would kill "IT"|`|D8jU4xhsaa	Happy-Go-Lucky Super Christian High<br>  i think shes mskin it up buddy|`|b74d692feeebce552bcfcdfcb6a76acdaa	Black Christmas|`|prTLJnXFaa	black christmas

There is also a smaller-size version known as 16mm, which people can buy and run in home theaters.<br>  <br>  One good place to look for 'prints' of movies (35mm prints or 16mm prints, as they're called) is on Ebay.  Prices will vary considerably, due to age, quality (as a film is run many times, it collects scratches on the film during it's run through the projector).<br>  <br>  There are sites on the web that sell films, like this one.

xIyqGfOhaa	Oh, okay I feel an arranged marriage is being planned for you, but that you want to find true love. It is being planned soon. The man is going to be open to having a new bride, but he will expect you to love and support him. You will hesitate awhile, waiting for true love to come, and while you are waiting, you will fall in love with this man. You will be very happy with him and he will not be controlling towards you. You will wait to have children, and enjoy being in love. You will never have thought that love could have existed this way in an arranged marriage. You will see him like a shining beacon, and feel very free around him. The only thing is, is that he will expect that, and he will not be as needy toward you, though he will still love you.

AA11136684	I have an agent. Look in your local papers they agents listings their usually every 2nd week. But you can look in the yellow pages, or on the internet, if you join any acting academy they provide you with all the detailed information to getting an agent. Ringing up the directry people on your home phone and ask for agents. But remembering they aren't cheap, and well it might take ages to get a commerical or a tv break though.... but good luck

Com o mar congelado, atravessaram da ásia para o Alasca. Daí foram descendo até a Patag?nia (levaram mil anos p/ chegar lá). Isto mostra que alguém descobriu o Brasil antes do Cabral. Estes s?o os nossos atuais índios.<br>  <br>  Ao que parece, antes disso, já existiam povos habitando a América, mas estes foram dizimados pelos asiáticos.<br>  <br>  De qualquer forma parece que os chineses também reivindicam a descoberta, pois enviaram uma grande expedi??o ao redor do mundo, bem antes de Cabral.<br>  <br>  Além do mais o que quer dizer "descobrir" depende de cada um. O país é t?o grande que a cada dia se descobre algo de novo.<br>  <br>  Sendo mais pragmático. Do meu ponto de vista, quem descobriu mesmo o Brasil foi o meu pai.

0ab1f0b6985ccb73fe54140fce6f47baaa	This song is about cocaine and China White heroin, 2 of lead singer Anthony Kiedis' drugs of choice. Both are a white powdery substance, which looks like snow. The lyrics, "So white as snow... Privately divided by a world so undecided" refer to dividing the coke/heroin into lines, so as to deal them or snort them. The line, "The more I see, the less I know, the more I'd like to let it go" means the deeper Kiedis was immersed in these drugs, the less he knew what was going on, and the more he wanted to kick the habit.<br>  <br>  Anthony Kiedis: "It's about the repeated failure to start your life anew and how difficult it can be to get rid off old ways of thinking, and destructive ideas we become so attached to."<br>  <br>  : )|`|Q4m1VKZvaa	they talk about sex in the desert

There is no "best month" to come out, just do it when you're ready, and when you know you'll be safe, even if it means waiting until you are in your twenties, or even older.|`|XyEsJrYkaa	when you are comfortable enough with yourself that you can. needing an excuse like is the month right, are the stars in the right position is just another way that you are trying to convince yourself that you cant do it. there is not a way of coming out that will make your life easy. in fact this will make your life harder on many levels. but until you do so then you are living a lie, and that is not really living. coming out may ostracize you from your community, friends, and even your family. however the longer you deny who you are, the harder it will be for you to come to terms with yourself. when you feel that you can handle all of the ridicule and bigotry that will eventually stem from this action then go ahead and come out. because ultimately you are the one who has to live your life and no one else. so do what you need to do to be happy with yourself because the rest is just details.

Os culpados <br>  est?o catalogados, fichados, e nada rola.               <br>   A verdade está na cara, mas a verdade n?o se <br>  imp?e.  Isto é uma situa??o inédita na História <br>  brasileira.                      <br>   Claro que a mentira sempre foi a base do sistema  <br>   político,                                       <br>  Infiltrada no  labirinto das oligarquias, claro que<br>  n?o esquecemos a supress?o, a proibi??o da verdade<br>  durante a ditadura, mas nunca a verdade foi t?o <br>   límpida à nossa  frente e, no entanto, t?o inútil,<br>    impotente, desfigurada.                           <br>    Os fatos reais: com a elei??o de Lula, uma <br>  quadrilha se enfiou no governo e   desviou bilh?es de <br>  dinheiro  público para tomar o Estado e ficar no poder 20 <br>  anos.   <br>  Os culpados s?o todos conhecidos, tudo está <br>   decifrado,   os cheques assinados, as contas no   <br>   estrangeiro, os tapes, as provas irrefutáveis, mas <br>  o governo psicopata de Lula nega e  ignora tudo.    Questionado ou flagrado, o psicopata n?o se    <br>   responsabiliza por suas a??es.                <br>   Sempre se acha inocente ou vítima do mundo, do <br>  qual tem de se vingar.                                 <br>  O outro  n?o existe para ele e n?o sente nem <br>  remorso  nem vergonha do que faz.                          <br>   Mente  compulsivamente, acreditando na própria  <br>   mentira, para conseguir poder.                    <br>   Este governo é psicopata!!! Seus membros riem da<br>   verdade,  Viram-lhe as  costas passam-lhe a m?o nas nádegas.  A verdade se encolhe, humilhada, num canto. E o <br>   pior é que o Lula, amparado  em sua imagem de <br>  "povo", consegue transformar a Raz?o em vil?, as provas<br>  ele em acusa??es "falsas", sua condi??o de                     cúmplice e Comandante em "vítima".   <br>  E a popula??o ignorante engole tudo. Como é <br>  possível isso?                                             <br>  Simples: o Judiciário paralítico entoca todos os<br>   crimes na  Fortaleza da lentid?o e da impunidade. <br>  Só  daqui a dois anos ser?o julgados  os indiciados - <br>  nos comunica o STF.                                 <br>  Os delitos s?o esquecidos, empacotados, <br>  prescrevem.                                      <br>    A Lei protege os crimes e regulamenta a própria<br>    desmoraliza??o.                                  <br>    Jornalistas   e formadores de opini?o sentem-se <br>     inúteis, pois a indigna??o ficou   supérflua.

Lulo-Petistas clamam:                             <br>   "Como é que a Procuradoria Geral, nomeada pelo <br>  Lula,  tem o desplante de ser  t?o clara! Como que o <br>  Osmar Serraglio pode ser t?o explícito, e como o  <br>  DelcídioAmaral n?o mentiu em nome do PT ? Como ousaram ser sinceros ?                                 <br>                                                                 <br>                        Sempre que a verdade eclode, reagem.             <br>                                                                                              Quando um juiz condena rápido, é chamado de   <br>     "exibicionista".      <br>  Quando apareceu  aquela grana toda no Maranh?o  <br>  (lembram, filhinhos?), a família  Sarney reagiu <br>    ofendida com a falta de "finesse" do governo de <br>  FH, que n?o Teve a  delicadeza de avisar que a polícia<br>     estava chegando... Mas Agora é diferente.    <br>     <br>   As palavras est?o sendo esvaziadas de sentido.  <br>  Assim como o stalinismo apagava fotos, reescrevia <br>   textos para contestar seus   crimes, o governo do <br>  Lula está criando uma língua nova, uma neo-língua<br>  empobrecedora da ciência política, uma língua<br>   esquemática, dualista, maniqueísta, nos preparando<br>   para o futuro político simplista que está se  <br>    consolidando no horizonte. Toda a complexidade <br>  rica do país será  transformada em uma massa de <br>  palavrasde ordem, de preconceitos ideológicos  movidos a<br>  dualismos e oposi??es, como tendem a fazer o  <br>   Populismo e o simplismo.

JgCGpQaxaa	Yes, she captured dream in episode 40 (going by the original Jananese airing).  The title of the episode was Sakura and the Sakura in the Dream, or Dream a Little Dream for the american dub version.  However, the american dub version was never aired on tv, and I am not certain if it was ever released on dvd.  You only may be able to watch it with subtitles, if that matters to you.|`|heqCqZTxaa	From what I recall few years ago:<br>  <br>  Sakura captured the dream card when she went on an outing with her friends. The Dream Card is in a Butterfly form. Upon encountering The Dream, she unconsciously fell into a lucid-dream state and tripped on the Butterfly.<br>  <br>  If I'm not mistaken, she captured the Dream Card in the elevator, when Shaoran is stopping the real world time with his Time Clow Card to wait for Sakura returned to conscious state. That moment of the capture is somewhere near the ending of it.

1bdc5d1fc07dba179583064dac754c34aa	Biografía de RadioheadBiografía de la banda <br>  Radiohead es una agrupación que surgió en el a?o de 1988 cuando un joven de Nombre Thom Yorke (Vocalista) y Colin Greenwood (Bajista) decidieron forman un grupo, al cual, primeramente llamaron "TNT". El integró después a Ed O’Brien (guitarra), Philip Selway (batería) y Jonny Greenwood (guitarra), formaron "On a friday", con el que sacaron un disco de demos que nunca salio al mercado oficialmente.<br>  <br>  A finales del '91 On a Friday llama la atención de las disqueras, concretando la firma con EMI, aquí comienza una larga amistad que ha durado hasta la fecha. EMI les sugiere un cambio de nombre e inspirados por una canción de Talking Heads: "Radio head", escogen: "Radiohead".. <br>  <br>  Ya con EMi, Radiohead edita su primer disco denominado "Pablo Honey", álbum con una presencia clara y determinante de las guitarras, cayendo dentro del clasico rock ingles: indy rock . La visión es bastante particular, existencialista y realista, dirigiendo sus criticas y lamentos a la sociedad contemporánea. Algo que marco a este disco fue el tema "Creep", canción que lanza a la fama a Radiohead, llevándolos a los primeros lugares de popularidad en las listas internacionales (aun ahora resulta ser una de las más conocidas y polémicas entre los seguidores). Este provocó la critica de que Radiohead era grupo de un sólo tema, de una "one hit wonder" y que su fama seria temporal, cosa que más adelante los de Oxford pondrían claro. Otros de los temas que llaman la atención de este disco son: "You", "Stop Whispering" y "Anyone Can Play Guitar". En 1994 Radiohead participa en el Reading Festival 94. <br>  <br>  Con un poco más de madurez musical en la bolsa Radiohead emprende con su segunda producción: "The Bends" (1995). El estilo no esta muy alejado de su antecesor, con la misma energía, la percepción del mundo no ha cambiado mucho, el 'joven con un ojo entre cerrado y potente voz' ha regresado, el estilo guitarrero lo tiene sellado y reafirmado. En este a?o Radiohead es telonero de REM, lo cual lo consolidad dentro de la escena rockera y sin duda una tremenda influencia, además a partir de aquí Radiohead y REM se vuelve unos grandes amigos y colegas, teniendo futuras colaboraciones juntos. Las canciones que destacaron en este disco fueron: "The Bends", "High And Dry", "Fake Plastic Trees", "Just" y "Street Spirit (Fade Out)". <br>  <br>  ?Que se puede esperar después de dos dicos? ?Qué sigue? La repuesta es: "OK Computer" (1997), una de las formas mas hermosas del lenguaje sonoro, texturas sencillas y potentes, un disco bastante adelantado a su tiempo. La temática es muy rica, proyecciones futuristas, extraterrestres, formulas hermosas, reacciones químicas, androides paranoicos, avionzazos de confort y liadísimas melancolías. Este material los lleva a comparaciones con Pink Floyd y más específicamente con "The Dark In The Moon", ganar un Grammy, ser considerado como el mejor disco de toda la historia y aseveraciones similares. En este mismo a?o el grupo participa en Glastonbury 97. <br>  <br>  En estos momentos Radiohead ya tiene un estilo, una formula y el camino fácil para producir su siguiente álbum y tener una aceptación segura, deciden dejar ese estilo "indy" y para conseguir un entorno alterno y más experimental, con el uso de su ya demostrado talento en los intrumentos y la voz y la incorporación de elementos y sonidos obtenidos de sus consolas digitales consiguen: "Kid A"(2000). La textura del disco continua con su muy propio caracter existencial, depresivo hasta cierto punto, abstracto y con la melancolía que ha traído la incorporación de nuevos elementos. Canciones como "Everything in its Right Place", "National Amthem", "How to Disappear Completely", "Morning Bell" e "idioteque" hacen adentrarte en este nuevo ambiente. <br>  <br>  Ya en el 2001 Radiohead edita "Amnesiac"(2001), proveniente de las sesiones de grabación de Kid A. Sonidos mas elaborados y maduros, ambientes extra?os, criticas a las relaciones sociales (inadaptación), canciones abismales y análisis profundos de la existencia, son temas que caracterizan a este material, un toque de Blues, que se venia acarreando desde el Kid A, lo encontramos de nueva cuenta, dibujándolo en canciones como: "Pyramid Song", "You And Whose Army", "I Might Be Wrong", "Like Spinning Plates" y "Life In A Glass House". <br>  <br>  En el 2003 Radiohead edita "Hail to the thief" disco donde se cambia sutilmente el estilo y la experiencia acumulada en los discos anteriores, retratando nuevamente el lado oscuro y oculto de una sociedad capitalista y violenta, influenciado por la guerra y por la esperanza generada por la misma. Radiohead se habia salio en Kid A y amnesiac del sistema de comercialización y en este disco se vuelve a retomar trayendo con sigo a muchos más fans a sus filas. En este a?o Radiohead tiene una extenuante agenda, se inicia un proyecto de difusión con con su página oficial y Radiohead TV así como varias apariciones en la televisión. Así, podemos destacar canciones como: "2 + 2 =5", "Backdrifts", "Where I End And You Begin", "We Suck Young Blood", "Go To Sleep", "There There" y "A Wolf At The Door". <br>  <br>  Durante este a?o 2004 Radiohead colabora para un obra musical con los que algunas vez fueron sus teloneros Sigur Ros denominados "splitsides" y Jonny comienza un proyecto alterno produciendo "Bodysong". Radiohead tendrá menor presencia en los escenarios (un tour por Japon, Australia y EUA) para tomarse un descanso y comenzar a pensar en su siguiente trabajo. En esté a?o radiohead editá un EP con B-sides, remasterizados y trcks en vivo para su gira por Japon y MéXICO es uno de los paices donde llega a la venta directamente. Se rumora que Radiohead ha experimentado e innovado tanto que será difícil que no recurra al auto plagio, aunque para estos genios superar nuestras expectativas ya les es costumbre. <br>  <br>  Unsaludo|`|w6aLrowiaa	Fijate en google, wikipedia|`|dkGKZFcMaa	tambien estuvo en guadalajara.

(as paraphrasing Leigh Paatsch in Melbourne's Herald Sun) Which means it will likely only appear at selected cinemas, as opposed to a general release in all cinemas.<br>  <br>  At worst, It might not make it here at all. Or be a DVD only release.<br>  <br>  I hope that was a decent answer and I haven't gotten my wires crossed anywhere.

I love to gaze at the pictures and my imagination takes me away. Get her something to decorate in her home, perhaps? Have you ever seen any of those digital picture frames? Do you think she would like something like that, especially if you got a camera with a memory card and just took random pictures of buildings, pastures, trees, parks, valleys, rivers, the ocean, clouds, the family, etc.? I'm sure she would love something like that. I know I would. <br>  Or maybe something she collects? if she does.<br>  Or a painting of art of some kind.

AA12376180	I agree, you are right on with this Doc. Every evening before retiring, I will make myself a cup of hot Ovaltine, sit down in my favorite chair and listen to some good music before retiring.<br>  <br>  Last night it was a painfully hard decision between Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto and Bella's Lullaby. I will not tell you which one I chose, however I will tell you that after listening for about 12 seconds, I threw the cup of Ovaltine at the speakers and went to bed.|`|qswrz268aa	They are? I'd think not. The second, third, and fourth are 3 of my favorite concertos. <br>  <br>  How exactly are they boring. Might I bring to your attention a rather epic 2nd movement of the 4th? It is one of the most beautiful and idyllic moments in music history. My favorite movement of all of the movement of all of the concerti... The third concerto is also excessively beautiful, once again it has a marvelous second movement... <br>  <br>  As for uninspired? How can anything by Beethoven been created by ungodly means? At least that's how I feel. <br>  <br>  I love his concerti!|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Wow, Doc... where do I even begin...<br>  <br>  His Piano Concerto No.4, while less famous than the renowned "Emperor" is one of my favorite concertos and certainly (IMHO) the best one of the five.<br>  <br>  I'll have to give this some more thought before I write more on the subject. To call the works "boring and uninspired" causes me to avoid making knee jerk responses along the lines of "are you out of your mind?"<br>  <br>  Edits will follow.<br>  <br>  Edit: Beethoven's piano concertos are perhaps the first concertos where the orchestra is more integrated with the piano and for that reason alone, makes them valuable from a music history standpoint. Also they reflect the development of the piano (an instrument that Beethoven always pushed to its limits). The third, for example, benefited from a new Erard sent to him by the Paris firm.<br>  The fourth however is the supreme masterpiece of the classical concerto form and really introduces romanticism to the piano concerto.<br>  The final concerto "Emperor" was hailed by Liszt as the "pillars of fire and smoke" that led the Israelites through through the desert to the Holy Land - Hardly boring and uninspired.<br>  <br>  The importance of Beethoven's contribution to the piano concerto can hardly be overstated.|`|nUkCnrA3aa	If you think that, you are not admirer of him. All of what he wrote was brilliant, some a tad slower than others. Regardless- Brilliant. The man was, and shall always be- The GREATEST composer of all time.<br>  -Ryko|`|t4zobY3Haa	ok... I personally really like his music<br>  <br>  but its really just a matter of what people think of the music<br>  some people prefer really hip hop fast music and stuff<br>  in fact MOST people prefer that, that's why most people consider him boring<br>  but hes not... hes one of the GREATEST of all time|`|0908foV3aa	I don't consider his concertos boring at all. I love all of them.|`|qv6C4kQraa	Beethoven Symphony No.7 Part 2  =  The sex.|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	The first opinion I heard that Beethoven's piano concertos are boring, I love them all and listen to them continuously.<br>  What about the third one ?

This is also the same way for Gay couples and I have personal experience with this. I'm not Gay but have gay friends and they're adopted children that are old enough to comment all have bad  hang ups and nasty things to say to everyone but they're parents out of respect, being afraid and so one. To me, this is the most selfish thing two people could do to a child. I was talking to a black friend of mine the other day and he married a white woman and have a teenage son and he's always making comments about he son and how light his skin is, how he has "the nice hair" and how he don't fit in.

It doesn’t matter if a person comes from Europe, Africa, South America, or Asia; we are all flesh and bone, bleed red, hate and love… human (Ok most of us are human).

11efb849d3f519970c638d2a462b8554aa	Meu amigo Tricolor do Flu n?o do grêmio porque sou Internacional fanática, a parada aí é difícel quer dizer é muito difícil, bom em minha opini?o, pois cada um tem a sua né, ficaria assim<br>  1) LUANA PIOVANI está anos luz das outras, a pontuac?o desta em mais "mala", mais antipática é t?o grande que n?o tem espa?o para tantos números, n?o é bonita, n?o é boa atriz, ficou famosa pelas suas "guerras" com a própia mídia que a colocou em evidência e também ficou famosa pelas suas trocas de namorados e vamo combina uns "malas" igual a ela esse Dado Dolabella é a vers?o masculina da Luana Piovane hihihihihihi, essa realmente "pensa" que é a rainha da cocada preta, ledo engano está mais para a "feijoada de domingo" popular, barata, e todo mundo vem e come um pouquinho.<br>  <br>  2) ADRIANE GALISTEU essa deveria ganhar o troféu "nariz", o nariz feio hem? Com tanto dinheiro porque n?o vai fazer uma plástica? Como apresentadora é meia boca mas "se acha a Hebe Camargo", antes é claro da Hebe Camargo ter 300 anos hihihihi, subiu na vida porque namorou um famoso e escreveu um livro, pronto agora só falta ela plantar uma árvore e ter um filho para ser um "ser humano" completo, antigamente n?o tinha o que comer hoje em dia é clinte fiel e defensora ardente das Lojas Daslu, "se acha mais bonita, rica, magra e importante do que realmente ela é", isto é "LAMENTáVEL".<br>  <br>  3) DANIELLA CICARELLI casou num castelo mas n?o tem dinheiro pra pagar um motel e usa a praia como se fosse um "QUE BONITO", essa realmente ganha, em minha opini?o o terceiro lugar, também ficou famosa quando "pegou" ou foi "pega" por uma celebridade neste caso estou falando do Ronaldoooooooo, o cache da mo?a subiu tanto que n?o pode mais desfilar no Brasil, " A COITADA", é "mala e antepática" porque: tem uma voz extremamente irritante,acho que foi por isso que o fen?meno mandou ela embora da Espanha depois de 3 meses de casamento hihihihi, "se acha celebridade", mas a única coisa que ela fez foi um comercial de refrigerante, aquele...lembram??? De resto n?o fez nada. é "zoiuda", tem os olhos que parecem aqueles dos desenhos japoneses, é "bocuda" a boca dela é maior que a boca de sapo que agüenta despacho, existe aquele ditado, "ha vou amarrar seu nome ou um pedido na boca do sapo", vixi, quanto nome e pedido n?o tem naquela boca, vai te uma boca grande assim lá no brejo, de resto é como as outras antepáticas de carteirinha, n?o fala com a imprensa, tem "pitis", troca de namorado com se fosse roupa, e o principal "se acha mais do que é", se todas elas soubessem que s?o mais chatas, malas e antepáticas do que elas pensam que s?o, seria melhor muito melhor.<br>  <br>  4) Bom em quarto lugar deu empate técnico entre: PRETA GIL e IVETE SANGALO se acham "descoladas", pensam que s?o "t?o queridas", que "s?o amadas pelo Brasil", grande engano dessas mo?as, pois uma é apenas filha de um famoso cantor e ministro o Gilberto Gil e ela n?o é "artista" como pensa ser, a outra pensa que é cantora como  "Bethania, Marisa Monte, Adriana Calcanhoto, Ana Carolina e outras divas da música Brasileira" mas é apenas uma cantora de axé ("que no me gusta ni un poquito"), que eu n?o gosto nem um pouquinho, dela e da música dela.<br>  <br>  5)LUCIANA GIMENEZ além de ser um "pouquinho" mala e antepática, é "lesa das idéias" tem uma infinidade de neur?nios com problema, que beira a donos cerebrais, essa "morena burra" realmente é a vingan?a de nós "as LOIRAS".<br>  Bom amigo, esta é minha opini?o sobre essas mo?as (ironizei e coloquei algumas caricaturas para exgerar sobre elas, mas o que penso delas é fato e está aí escrito, me desculpem as pessoas que s?o f?s dessas "atrizes, cantoras, apresentadoras enfim artistas assim é o que elas pensam que s?o" n?o é verdade?), mas existem muito mais famosas antepáticas neste país, elas "se acham mais do que realmente s?o", mas todas comem, v?o ao banheiro e nas suas atitudes fazem "ca.gadas", como todo mundo, ninguém está acima do bem ou do mal o ser humano comete erros e acertos ninguém é perfeito se n?o n?o seria "ser humano", mas existe sobre os "famosos" uma espectativa, uma esperan?a para "se espelhar", para servir como exemplo, principalmente para as crian?as hoje em dia t?o ligadas, na televis?o e internet, por isso a obriga??o deles em acertarem mais, em serem os "heróis" que acreditamos que s?o, a serem as boas pessoas que achamos que eles s?o e que queremos ser também, n?o adianta apenas usufruir da fama, do dinheiro e da badala??o e n?o dar nenhuma contribui??o à vida, já que ganharam tanto, digo no sentido de dinheiro, de fama, de uma vida melhor mesmo, chega um determinado momento que a pessoa precisa retribuir o que a própia vida lhe deu, e bons exemplos, ajudar a quem precisa, ser mais "humano", s?o coisas básicas para quem já ganhou tanto da vida né!!!!!!!

31abc6887170a60e97857497f538c28faa	Sou Ariana...<br>  Vou te mandar as combina??es com todos os signos e vc vê com qual vc mais combina ok?<br>  Aguardo resposta...<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e áries:<br>  A paix?o e o estímulo costumam predominar nos primeiros encontros entre esses dois signos. Entretanto a chama desse grande amor, alimentada principalmente pela grande atra??o física e a ilus?o, t?o logo se apagará quando o ariano come?ar a se sentir entediado e irritado pelo ciúme e pela possessividade geradas por Escorpi?o.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Touro:<br>  Touro e Escorpi?o, signos opostos, correm o risco de terem muitas confus?es violentas, misturadas a uma paix?o louca, principalmente se n?o houver afeto, pois ambos têm uma sexualidade muito forte. Devem tomar cuidado com o ciúme e a possessividade, característica comum aos dois signos. Se a mulher pertencer ao signo de Touro, o casamento deve durar, já que, enquanto Escorpi?o domina, ela vai se realizando no lar e nos filhos. Por outro lado, no ambito profissional, pode haver uma atmosfera de inveja, podendo deteriorar essa combina??o.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Gêmeos:<br>  Entre esses dois signos pode surgir uma violenta paix?o ou uma frieza total devido a suas profundas diferen?as. Dotados de temperamentos diversos, o geminiano racional e o escorpiano instintivo, eles se entreolham com paix?o ou com indiferen?a. Quando a uni?o acontece no plano profissional ela pode dar certo porque cada um supre as carências do outro.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Cancer:<br>  Dificuldades devem acontecer nesta alian?a. Mas, se os dois souberem como ultrapassar os obstáculos iniciais, ela será uma uni?o das mais duradouras. O escorpiano deve ajudar o parceiro a vencer os bloqueios sexuais liberando-o para o amor físico. O ciúme pode separá-los, mas a sexualidade poderá uni-los para sempre. Cabe ao escorpiano providenciar essa liberdade. Se a mulher for canceriana, as oportunidades aumentam consideravelmente.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Le?o:<br>  Uni?o está marcada por uma paix?o excepcional, fora do comum, porém com crises de ciúme e conflitos de autoridade. Junto, no plano profissional, Le?o e Escorpi?o soltam chispas e quase explodem. E que ninguém se atreva apaziguá-los, pois os dois detestam as intromiss?es de quem quer que sejam. Se por acaso os desentendimentos n?o forem muito graves, o casal pode ficar junto por toda a vida. Essa combina??o desconhece a melancolia.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Virgem:<br>  Os dois signos s?o muito diferentes e somente o trabalho em comum poderá garantir a permanência dessa combina??o. Embora Virgem goste da passionalidade de Escorpi?o e este vibre com a fidelidade do parceiro, os defeitos tender?o a prevalecer entre eles. Passada a atra??o inicial, o virginiano racional n?o suportará o constante ciúme de Escorpi?o. Este, por sua vez ficará extremamente irritado com as insistentes críticas contra o parceiro.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Libra:<br>  Se Libra se submeter a Escorpi?o e n?o lhe provocar ciúme, poderá receber em troca uma vida amorosa plena e feliz. No campo profissional a colabora??o n?o é favorável porque o libriano n?o aceitará, em hipótese alguma, o autoritarismo de Escorpi?o.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Escorpi?o:<br>  Grandes paix?es e grandes brigas entre esses dois signos iguais que se juntam. Depois aparecer?o, em cada um deles, os mesmos defeitos e, se n?o houver influências favoráveis que modifiquem essas nefastas inclina??es, a uni?o poderá chegar ao seu fim. Na profiss?o a combina??o também é negativa.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Sagitário:<br>  A atra??o sexual é intensa entre os nativos destes signos, e a uni?o será feliz e efetiva se o escorpiano conseguir mandar nela, mas deverá, também, moderar a sua possessividade e, quanto ao sagitariano, ele terá, sem dúvida, que conviver com o ciúme e o egoísmo do parceiro. O enlace pode se por estima, o que é positivo se for considerada apenas a área profissional.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Capricórnio:<br>  Problemas sexuais podem surgir entre o escorpiano passional e o parceiro racional. Porém se ambos os tipos forem evoluídos, a uni?o será harmoniosa, sendo perfeitamente possivel a convivência. No campo profissional, a colaborac?o é altamente positiva.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Aquário:<br>  A forte atra??o exercida entre essas duas personalidades, que de nada tem de moderado, pode ser de extrema dura??o, porém o ciúme lan?ado por Escorpi?o limitará a liberdade do aquariano e isto poderá, com o passar do tempo, deteriorar o relacionamento amoroso. Já a colabora??o artística e profissional promete ser bem-sucedida.<br>  <br>  Escorpi?o e Peixes:<br>  Em princípio, trata-se de uma paix?o fulminante e irresistível, mas com o passar do tempo o relacionamento pode alcan?ar níveis bastante elevados ou decair para as mais profundas crises de ciúme. Nesta combina??o, bastante problemática, o amor n?o substitui a ausência de passionalidade de Peixes e poderá haver um ciúme recíproco. No campo profissional, o escorpiano dará garra e energia ao parceiro, que lhe prometerá novas iniciativas.<br>  <br>  E aí?Deu pra descobrir com qual vc combina mais?<br>  Aguardo resposta...<br>  Bjus =]|`|9237480917f5991c4ac74b9fdca2588aaa	sou virginiana,ascendente áries. bem eu ? acredito muito em signos, só leio por hobbie e acho q essa de combinar é furada. um dia vc vai encontrar o seu par sem precisar ver o signo!|`|0d357b2b0c3fbc03ec992e125c2e44d6aa	LIOn|`|d4b187d4404e823ce9852cb7e861d059aa	Sou tb mas n?o sei como combina mas seu amor vira procure n?o sofrer tanto acaba um amor vem outro ate encontrar seu par ideal|`|22a18a0cac2f857cd34f5429fdefa656aa	Ha! o meu amor é escorpi?o, e eu sou virgem, já fiz algumas leituras , segundo elas escorpi?o e virgem tem uma compatibilidade ótima, inclusive sexualmente, mas eu acho que n?o funciona, ele nunca quis saber de me amar.|`|d86e2eca949d640203c288cd575b8c07aa	Aquário!<br>  11o signo do Zodíaco!|`|d9387ee4316bc7725afb8449ab912a10aa	Eu n?o acredito em horóscopo, faz moh temp?o que eu nao leio o meu pq nem entendo msm, pra entender horoscopo tem que ser astronomo!<br>  <br>  O meu é gemeos.<br>  <br>  Abra?os:-)|`|dfd5a2f5766a30e3b138a1e2dee2a687aa	Sou de touro.|`|49d6392b7c30d2411c5b1c510bc7fae7aa	num intendo mto d sígnos, + sou virginiana!!!!|`|e9a20d7df33bc41bee47c39fd978d41aaa	Eu só de aquario com ascedente em le?o.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Mais na minha opini?o vc naum pode se prender tanto ao signo e achar que o seu amor verdadeiro é de um determinado signo....<br>  <br>  <br>  O amor simplismente acontece....|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	sou de sagitario e penso que para uma pessoa combinar com a outra nao importa o signo o que importa e que elas se gostem e cada uma respeite os gostos e jeito do parceiro(a) ok|`|f589d69f6682b4b8f76de7b299d0b7c7aa	Sou Aries.|`|fc076d137760997219b65a3b35f89b80aa	sou de áries com ascendente em virgem e leio o horóscopo todo dia...<br>  se é pra encontrar seu grande amor, vc encontra, n?o importa o signo dele...boa sorte!!!=]|`|61cf011aa099b099aee1ca120fd8062aaa	sou le?o e ascendente em le?o...em duplicidade vixi!!!!!!<br>  vai no site somos todos um q vc vai achar tudo lá:<br>  www.somostodosum.com.br<br>  ou<br>  www.personari.com.br<br>  <br>  bjs|`|854973ff26efde2c47f6a3dec95fec12aa	Escorpi?o tbm!|`|8c84e1307b4e63558495d6ee1708bba8aa	OI gata sou de capricornio ascendente de virgem, nao acredito que signos conbinao, estou relacionado com uma pessoa de peixes, vc esta sofrendo por amor acho que vc ainda nao emcontrou a sua alma gemia, beijossssss JR-DF.|`|0455fbba6e8aab6b01d07d4772b86079aa	sou de sargitário!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8f362cb081c58e260f99bf7150bcaba6aa	Eu sou de le?o, eu n?o vejo muito horóscopo, mas quando eu vejo eu olho só o que ele prevê para mim...por isso n?o sei se essa combina??o é boa ou n?o...|`|0d203981af0cdd1b49d41bf5ef352673aa	o meu é le?o mais n?o acredito muito nisso .|`|aae3d440019a286c66050b75b99cd2b6aa	Sou de Capricórnio|`|11e8168ab1e49564ec405abcb3d39d72aa	EU SOU DE AQUARIO NASCI NO DIA 3 DE FEVEREIRO!!!!!!!<br>  BEJINHO|`|b045dafa15fc0806a4b285d0e966df9caa	sou de cancer|`|2252c0459a0cefcd70d05ae14eab2b71aa	Sou de cancer...me confundo muito com esses trecos de ascendentes<br>  <br>  =(|`|2b135f916873fa43cd58f4edffe21fd4aa	eu so de gemeos e me encontro na mesma situa?ao q vc sofro de + tbm se vc tem msn me add lá um pode ajudar o outro. o meu é johnarlem0206@msn.com|`|d876dc2e19e72ee40730492e59ad367caa	Sou aquário...

Existem as conscidências e tem coisas que n?o tem nada comigo.<br>  <br>  Ascendente em Capricórnio <br>  <br>  Seu ascendente n?o deixa dúvidas: você n?o admite atitudes impensadas nem suporta pessoas escandalosas. Extremamente cioso da sua auto-imagem, você nunca vai se permitir uma postura ou uma roupa de aparência desleixada. Regido por Saturno, o planeta dos limites e da raz?o humana, você n?o faz nada sem antes pensar muito nas conseqüências. Na verdade, você se leva muito a serio e às vezes superestima sua própria capacidade de interferir no mundo. Máscaras. Essa é uma das coisas mais interessantes de se observar em você, diante de determinadas situa??es. às vezes aparece uma express?o séria, um rosto quase imóvel que mostra muito pouco do que está se passando no mundo interior. è a cara do jogador de p?quer, que n?o pode deixar os outros perceberem as cartas que ele tem na m?o...Outras vezes aparece o piadista, o palha?o que está sempre rindo e provocando a platéia com o seu humor sarcástico. S?o máscaras iguais, ambas, porém, s?o usadas para impedir que os outros possam invadir o seu mundo de sentimentos. Tendo o signo de Cancer na casa das parcerias e dos relacionamentos estáveis, você é extremamente vulnerável ao que acontece com os seus parceiros. Muitas vezes estabelece rela??es de dependência -- ou se ligando a alguém frágil, de quem possa cuidar, ou relacionando-se com alguém muito forte, para que possa ser cuidado. Nos dois casos há um componente materno que marca suas rela??es estáveis. A rigidez dos que seguem o caminho de Saturno muitas vezes cria problemas para o corpo. Principalmente na coluna e nas articula??es. Cuidado! Para aliviar esses sintomas, o indicado é fazer exercícios de relaxamento e perseguir, desde cedo, uma atitude flexível diante da vida. <br>  <br>  Sol em Escorpi?o <br>  Você sabe, desde muito cedo, que tudo na vida está em transforma??o e que há um mistério por trás de todas as coisas visíveis. Oposto ao signo de Touro, que se encanta e se apaixona pela forma das coisas, você é naturalmente atraído pelo que se esconde atrás das aparências. Oitavo signo do Zodíaco, Escorpi?o é regido por Plut?o, um deus que morava nas profundezas da terra e que tinha a capacidade de se tornar invisível. Plut?o presenteia seus filhos com um dom que, se n?o for muito bem compreendido e usado, pode ser fonte de muita perturba??o: a capacidade de perceber a tens?o interna que está nas coisas e que pode fazer com que elas mudem. é por isso que as pessoas como você rendem muitíssimo nos momentos de crise e podem salvar situa??es que parecem completamente perdidas. E é exatamente pelo mesmo motivo que ficam t?o desconfortáveis quando têm que fazer um trabalho de rotina, que n?o exija esfor?o nem intensidade ou onde, de alguma forma, se sintam impotentes para mudar o rumo das coisas. As suas qualidades v?o se manifestar através de uma intui??o poderosa e um temperamento observador que tanto pode gerar grandes médicos como grandes financistas. O desejo de aprofundamento pode criar grandes cientistas e o desejo de poder e de controle empurra muitos de vocês para a política. Mas quando toda essa intensidade fica bloqueada, o poder plutoniano se manifesta no pior defeito de Escorpi?o: o ressentimento. E o poder de cura pode se transformar em capacidade de destrui??o. A forte sensualidade, que é um tra?o comum na sua pessoa, fala de uma necessidade de transcender a si próprio e de se sentir parte da grande for?a que impulsiona as transforma??es que est?o em curso na humanidade.|`|1d3b27dd26b77a993a4a2a635dde80cbaa	Eu sou de peixes mas n?o acredito muitos nos horóscopos.|`|c2ef63faf6e9e05ae3d49afe5797da5faa	Libra.|`|42ecd2bc8874650ade0b5048e83d05c3aa	Eu também|`|11ba601d413e9e755866bab1c5ed7aeeaa	eu acredito em diferen?as entre signos mas n?o em horóscopo.<br>  é só vc procurar na net e vc encontrará tudo.|`|2df9b766c39bdd1e58de398ab97a623eaa	Eu sou virgem com ascendente em touro.

8cfb3039914cf1e875ec63a8f6899403aa	A Globo agora que quer atrair jovens para o horário com uma novela de magia trata-os como estúpidos. Seria melhor guardar dinheiro para uma ou duas novelas e colocar a novela dos jovens no horário para n?o piorar o nível. Adorei o seu jogo com as letras caindo. Ví o final desta novela e achei medonho, tosco, típico do padr?o zorra total de momíce sem gra?a. Cruz credo. Pavoroso. Aliás estava cansado de ver a estrela amada pelo protagonista toda vez ser espancada, sequestrada humilhada pelo Clóvis. Já que o vil?o tem um final infeliz e n?o p?de se ver envelhecido (pro bem dele e do Dalton Veigh, hehe) a Globo resolveu espancar sequestrar humilhar a nossa inteligência e o nosso tempo. Como diz o refr?o popular: ninguémerece.|`|3c647e0f666ddf71b9db90d8b7c8b942aa	Infelizmente n?o se pode esperar nada da Rede Globo de Televis?o,as novelas s?o repetitivas sempre terminam IGUAIS ESSA FOI PARECIDA COM aLMA gêmea.|`|b54d9319f82c90162b115d7673defc89aa	Ultimamente todas as novelas da Globo est?o deixando a desejar,é fracaso atrás de fracasso.|`|bc324f6da59154f1a203484435c7d60caa	nao espere nada de novelas! para de assistir isso... vc assistiu todo dia esse lixo e aprendeu o que?

Ge32WVVfaa	O HOMEM VIRGINIANO=<br>  <br>  O HOMEM - Este homem vive, quase que inteiramente, num plano prático, material, e de pouco serve para as abstra??es de um romance livresco. Sua principal maneira de expressar o amor está ligada à desinteressada devo??o à família, aos amigos e aos mais fracos e mais desorganizados do que ele. Ele nasceu com um amor instintivo pelo trabalho, pelo dever, pela disciplina e dedica??o aos desamparados. Há meios definidos para se atingir o cora??o do virginiano. Meios secretos.<br>  <br>  Odeia as transas rapidinhas, que v?o direto ao ponto. Ao contrário, prolonga o máximo as preliminares e descobre mistérios nunca antes desvendados.<br>  <br>  Em troca, n?o pede, mas espera um tratamento classe A, de preferência com fidelidade e constancia. Afinal, quando se entrega plenamente, o mínimo que corpo exige é respeito.<br>  <br>  <br>  ATRA??O FATAL: : por Peixes, principalmente pelos mistérios e surpresas que os nativos desse signo reservam.<br>  <br>  CONTATOS QUENTES: com Cancer, Escorpi?o e Touro. Os minutos passados com eles podem parecer eternos. <br>  <br>  O QUE IRRITA UM VIRGINIANO=<br>  <br>  Choramingue bastante.<br>  <br>  Desarrume sua (dele) casa, atrapalhe sua programa??o, esque?a de atarrachar a pasta de dente.<br>  Cheire feito um gambá.<br>  <br>  Diante do armário do banheiro, indague -"para que taaanto remédio?".<br>  <br>  Fa?a xixi na tampa da privada, ou, de preferência, no ch?o, em volta do vaso.<br>  <br>  Critique o jeito deles se vestirem. Diga que aquele dentinho torto é "um charme".<br>  <br>  Use os vasos de planta deles como cinzeiro, e enterre os palitinhos de fósforo na terra.<br>  <br>  Depois de abra?á-los longamente, revele que você está fazendo um tratamento contra piolhos. <br>  <br>  e pra finalizar....<br>  <br>  VIRGEM X C?NCER=<br>  <br>  <br>  Esta é a forte e amistosa influência do padr?o 3-11 (Virgem é o 3o signo a contar de Cancer; e este o 11o a contar de Virgem), permitindo que os dois, por mais engra?ados e singulares que pare?am aos demais, sintam-se perfeitamente bem e naturais em companhia um do outro.<br>  <br>  Virgem se sente a salvo dentro da presen?a protetora dos Caranguejos, os quais s?o solícitos em rela??o a seu bem-estar, realmente preocupados e afetivos.<br>  <br>  Da mesma forma, o Caranguejos se sentem bem, flutuando em torno da quietude de Virgem, como em um paraíso longe das ruas barulhentas, apinhadas de gente, cheias de imposi??es. O principal obstáculo de crescente tes?o que os dois precisam superar é o seguinte.<br>  <br>  Após algum tempo, o homem ou mulher de Virgem pode considerar as maneiras solícitas do Caranguejo, sua ansia protetora, como uma espécie de pris?o - e cortesmente (a princípio) pedirá a liberdade condicional.<br>  <br>  Este é o sinal para o canceriano afastar-se um pouco e viver de acordo com a imagem do solitário, por toda uma vida imaginária, que durará algumas semanas ou meses. Mas haverá sempre um retorno amistoso à harmonia, bastando um pequeno esfor?o<br>  <br>  boa sorte ;)|`|8RVNc4vcaa	Seja você mesma!|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	vc deve ser vc mesma,e mande um bilhetinho para ele.|`|ziJMoKkFaa	Continue jogando charme, conversando que vc irá conquistar ele.

N?o sei porque, acho que é porque eu odeio a Globo do amago do meu ser HAEUhaEuhAEuhAEUaE.<br>  O único programa que eu assisto é o Programa do J? (que também passa na CBN, ou seja, n?o é 100% da Globo). E às vezes os jornais, mas é muito raro.|`|PlKAGC09aa	Eu assisto o jornal local desta rede e só.

A vantagem é que as outras emissoras est?o melhorando.<br>  Voltando a Globo o que deixa a desejar é o jornalismo com o protecionismo ao governo.|`|CA74JxUEaa	Fazer quest?o n?o é bem o Termo, pois acredito que em torno de 90% dos brasileiros, inclusive eu, assiste ou  vai assistir algum programa da TV Globo. Mas igual a mim muitos brasileiros est?o deixando de assistir, pois as concorrentes tem mostrado valor, em alguns horários. E em alguns casos, digo programas, s?o infinitamente melhores que os da Globo.  mMas o que deve esatar provocando os telespectadores é o fato da globop n?o mudar. As novelas s?o as mesmas de 15 anos atrás. ( e que ainda continuam sendo as melhores - A viagem - O profeta - Sinha mo?a ), mas as novas s?o terríveis (os autores pegam um personasgem de uma novela + personagem de outra novela + um terceiro personagem de outra novela = está pronto mais uma novela inédita), n?o tem nda de novo. Nos jornais, uma garimpagem para ver a notícia se pode ou n?o divulga-la. Filmes com vários cortes. Programas de humor ainda salva, menos o zorra. E aí vai. Odiar n?o. Mas gostar de outras sim. Minha opni?o.|`|DGLh1R1Yaa	è só vc analisar, da mesma maneira que ela cria estrelas da noite para o dia ela acaba com a carreira de qualquer um, manipula??o total. Ela consegue fazer a cabe?a de babacas para gastar uma liga??o telef?nica para votar no BBB! arrecada milh?es com isso e depois paga um premio de somente 1 milh?o e o povo acha o maior negócio do mundo, tenha dó! A Globo nunca ligou para a stock-car depois que o filho do intragável come?ou a correr nela eles tem coragem até de transmitir a corrida. Sem contar outros programas que ninguém merece, tipo: Faust?o, trapalh?es, e outras porcarias. Confesso que os únicos programas aproveitáveis s?o os jornais, globo rural e raras vezes o globo reporter, o resto é só babaquice.|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	Porque a globo n?o e melhor em tudo,ela pode ter programas melhores como jornais,mas perdem com programas diferentes,sempre o mesmo.eu acho que todos assistem algum programa da globo,como também assistem programas do sbt,record.a globo vem decaindo ultimamente com a sua programa??o humorística e as novelas.|`|gO1kn76eaa	acho por serem meio radicais...

Tratava-se de um fotógrafo que saiu para atender um chamado de uma familia que queria fotografar sua crianóa recem-nascida, mas que por um engano, errara o endere?o procurado.<br>       E o dialogo se seguiu:<br>  HOMEM : Bom dia!

Ele foi trabalhar.<br>  HOMEM : Presumo que esteja a par.<br>  MULHER: Sim, ele já estáá sabendo de tudo.  Eu tambem concordo.<br>  HOMEM : ótimo.　Ent?o vamos come?ar.<br>  MULHER: Mas já?

Sinceramente a maioria dos programas da TV aberta s?o terríveis, sen?o dizer q todos s?o péssimos com seus apresentadores, q n?o agregam nada a nossa vida. <br>  Podemos só destacar o canal CULTURA, que tem bons programas, mas pela baixa audiência e por ser fomentado pela educa??o e cultura, n?o é atrativo para o povo que gosta de baixarias.<br>  <br>  é uma quest?o cultural, acho q os programas s?o fontes de renda e geram recursos para as TV′s através das empresas que bancam os comercias e propagandas, sendo assim o povo assistindo e dando audiência, acabam bancando o longo tempo de vida estes fracos programas. <br>  <br>  Infelizmente temos que nos apegar e "pagar" (TV a cabo) para ter programas com bom nível de cultura!|`|07yKfT6vaa	o  programa  da  xuxa|`|4ArLoVqFaa	Sem duvida alguma o faust?o ele consegue ser o pio de todos mas se tratar de bom apresentador indiscutivelmente o j? soares|`|a1300b01cbecb8f5c44b157ba363e995aa	pior apresentador é Faut?o,pois é mto mal educado , tem tbm a gilmelandia q é mto sem gra?a.apresentador q n suporto nem ele nem o programa é o Raul Gil,e programa sem gra?a é o viva a noite.|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	e a turma do didi com renato aragao o programa sem gra?a nem sei porque passam ele.|`|ff93e936f0ff60e62805130d7e20f137aa	Meu,<br>  simplesmente o SUPERPOP da Luciana Gimenez é rídiculo, t?o patético e baixo, que tá cada vez pior...e sem dúvida ela é a pior apresentadora da tv brasileira!!!|`|fffa2646884f98b92eff9a8981bb541baa	Gugu e Faust?o atualmente s?o os piores no ar.Mas o campe?o sempre será "JO?O KLEBER".

Quando falta assunto o programa sempre apela para entrevistas com prostitutas ou garotas de programa. Quando há assunto, o que se ve s?o artistas decadentes falando sobre o lado mais sombrio de suas carreiras:brigas, rivalidades com colegas de trabalho, drogas, sexo.... Enfim, o que se procura mostrar ao telespectador é exatamente o que há de pior no ser humano. N?o bastasse essa falta de conteúdo, o próprio formato do programa denuncia a falta de talento da apresentadora: as entrevistas s?o pre-gravadas para que a Luciana Gimenez fale o menos possível. E, na verdade, n?o podemos lamentar o seu silencio pois em grande parte das vezes ela tem pouco pra contribuir com seu programa. N?o é a toa que ela se apegou tanto ao bord?o ABAFA porque da torneirinha de asneiras que é sua boca é preciso ter no minimo senso crítico.

Você sabe fazer festa para conquistar quem deseja e, quando vê o menor sinal de interesse da pessoa, vai logo espalhando a alegria para chamar a aten??o.

Donos de um senso de humor enorme, s?o capazes de fazer qualquer um se animar em qualquer situa??o. Vendo o lado alegre e belo da vida podem animar as pessoas contando suas aventuras, mesmo num velório, a n?o ser que seja de seu melhor amigo, e ele considera todos assim. Neste caso é capaz de chorar t?o alto e agarrar no caix?o com tanta for?a que todos pensar?o que o falecido era seu amigo de infancia e que convivia todos os dias com ele, mas conheceu há poucas semanas. Nenhuma figura mitológica representa t?o bem o Sagitário como o centauro, metade homem metade cavalo. De um lado um ser racional que filosofa sobre a vida e faz de tudo para que a lei seja obedecida, e de outro t?o abrutalhado que é capaz de comprar uma briga fazendo voar cadeiras para todos os lados. é... eles s?o meio escandalosos, exagerados e estabanados.   <br>   Extremamente francos, sempre prezam a verdade, mesmo que ela seja inadequada para o momento, o que os faz passar por inconvenientes em algumas situa??es. Sempre prontos a conhecer novas coisas na vida, eles esperam que todos tenham essa mesma disposi??o. Aventureiros e livres que s?o, é impossível segurá-los quando se decidem a viajar e conhecer outros mundos. Fome... como têm fome esses sagitarianos. Comem qualquer coisa, desde arroz, feij?o e ovo frito (claro que um prato enorme) até sopa de rinoceronte rosa da Iugoslávia, e eles adoram comidas exóticas, desde que sejam em quantidade, e melhor ainda se forem típicas de países distantes. Sagitarianos s?o eternos gozadores, mesmo quando est?o brigando. Assistir uma briga em que eles estejam participando é o mesmo que assistir uma comédia italiana, com sacadas geniais e um humor ferino terrível, antes de come?arem a voar pratos e cinzeiros. Depois disso s?o capazes de chamar o adversário, todo arrebentado, para tomar uma cerveja para esquecer as diferen?as, desde que sua opini?o tenha sido aceita. <br>  Eles se acham donos da verdade e discutem horas só para convencer as pessoas sobre um ponto de vista seu. Conhecem um pouco de tudo, o que os torna capazes de fazer qualquer bico, e em muitas vezes de forma “provisória-permanente”. Dinheiro.... como gastam dinheiro. Consumistas por natureza n?o conseguem conter seu impulso de comprar, qualquer coisa, uma de cada cor e de cada modelo. Mas eles têm sorte e sempre arranjam dinheiro, nem que for em jogo, que por sinal eles podem adorar. S?o ótimos esses seres de Sagitário. E n?o é pra menos : quem rege este signo é nada mais nada menos que Júpiter, o maior planeta do sistema solar, Zeus para os gregos, deus dos deuses, sendo t?o bons e violentos quanto ele. Ser amigo de um sagitariano é ser o melhor amigo dele, mesmo que você n?o queira. Crédulos e ingênuos, costumam se decepcionar com aquele seu melhor amigo que conheceu numa viagem no último final de semana e que pediu dinheiro emprestado e n?o devolveu. Mas tudo bem. Depois de reencontrá-lo e cobri-lo de porrada ele ainda vai chamá-lo para tomar uma cerveja e relembrar os velhos tempos, mesmo que estejam completando três semanas de amizade. <br>  <br>  ANATOMIA<br>  Sagitário está associado anatomicamente aos quadris e as coxas. O nervo ciático, o maior nervo do corpo é uma parte sensível do sagitariano. O fígado e o pancreas também est?o associados, sendo freqüentemente alvo de complica??es. <br>  <br>  RELACIONAMENTO <br>  SEXO<br>  Ardente como ninguém e romantico como ele só, quando um Sagitário ama se envolve de tal maneira que parece estar vivendo mais uma vez a história de Romeu e Julieta, juntando a isso uma boa dose de prazer e erotismo. Desde cedo o Sagitário percebe que sexo e amor caminham juntos, amando como um adolescente para toda a vida. Curioso que é sempre buscará novas formas de prazer, podendo querer fazer amor em horas e lugares mais loucos, só para unir aventura e amor.   <br>    Adoram criar um clima antes de uma rela??o e sempre estar?o buscando conhecer novas formas de satisfazer o ser amado. Dificilmente ele se deitará com uma pessoa por pura atra??o física e sempre colocará uma dose de sentimento imenso. Metade humano, o amor come?a pela cabe?a e um bom papo, mas terminará com ele usando totalmente a sua outra metade animal. Uau... amor em dose cavalar.  <br>  <br>  PRESENTES<br>  Fique atento ao que o sagitariano está falando e ou se interessando no momento. Eles mudam muito seus interesses e pode estar se dedicando hoje muito à música country, e amanh? estar ouvindo jazz. Como um CD é sempre um bom presente, experimente dar-lhe um de música clássica, de preferência com grandes acordes e sinfonias clássicas populares. Um CD com a trilha sonora de um filme que ele comenta ser o melhor que viu até hoje vai deixá-lo alucinado. Mas é bom ser rápido, antes que ele veja outro filme e mude de idéia.    <br>  Livros ? Só se ele estiver muito envolvido com o assunto. Lembran?as de sua última viagem só ser?o bem-vindos se ele já tiver ido lá. Ele morrerá de inveja se você conheceu um lugar antes que ele. Para mulheres mande flores, dúzias delas, de preferência rosas vermelhas vindas da Col?mbia, que além de grandes e carnudas, devem ter dado um trabalho enorme para colher, o que as fascina muito. Para os homens vale a pena dar bebidas importadas e objetos. Para todos : um fim de semana com tudo pago num lugar distante em que poucos tenham ido e ele possa tirar muitas fotos e contar suas aventuras.  <br>  <br>  CONQUISTA<br>  Já tentou domar um cavalo selvagem ? Essa é sua tarefa se você quiser ter ao seu lado esse ser livre e solto que é o Sagitário. Estar ao lado do sagitariano e chamar sua aten??o vai requerer um bom f?lego e paciência. Disposto a manter sua liberdade e uma vida cheia de aventuras, o sagitariano vai se interessar por pessoas que sejam dinamicas e alegres e que em hipótese alguma demonstrem mal humor e monotonia. Quando você conquistá-lo deverá ter um bom pique para acompanhá-lo em suas viagens, passeios e todas as atividades sociais que ele costuma participar, e ainda se desprover de ciúme e possessividade    <br>    Eles detestam qualquer pessoa que o vigie e fique pegando no seu pé. Cheio de sonhos e fantasias ele vai adorar se você embarcar em seus devaneios e dar corda à sua imagina??o. Com uma cultura geral ampla e sua mente filosófica, e tagarela como ele só, vai adorar conversar horas e horas sobre a vida e o sentido de estar neste mundo. Diga que ele está sonhando muito alto e o que ele pretende é impossível e você verá este cavalo selvagem debandar e se juntar aos seus iguais e dificilmente você o verá de novo, perdendo a oportunidade de conhecer mais sobre o que é viver.  <br>  <br>  AMIZADE<br>  Sagitarianos fazem amizades muito facilmente. é uma necessidade constante que têm em ter amigos com os quais possa passar suas informa??es e descobertas, e um bom motivo para se divertir e andar em bando como tanto gosta. Fiéis e generosos os sagitarianos costumam tratar qualquer pessoa que tenha trocado uma simples palavra com ele como se fosse amigo de muito tempo. Ent?o n?o se espante se um deles abordar você no ponto do ?nibus enquanto espera alguém, e quando esse alguém chegar você ser apresentado como amigo    <br>    Amáveis e cordiais eles s?o amigos, companheiros e quase irm?os, e sempre contam com você para o que der e vier, ou seja, ele sempre espera que você o acompanhe em suas maluquices e aventuras. Você vai ter que conseguir um f?lego a mais para conviver com ele. Animados e entusiastas, sempre est?o botando você pra cima e incentivando a conquistar mais coisas. Mas se prepare : eles s?o muito eufóricos e por conta disso podem cair em depress?o profunda facilmente, e tirá-los de lá pode ser uma tarefa quase impossível. Quando você estiver desistindo de ajudá-lo, quando menos espera, lá vem ele, a galope como um cavalo, todo feliz e alegre. A tristeza foi ontem, agora é um novo dia. Haja paciência com esses sagitarianos, mas vale a pena. E como vale !|`|02f0dd6937948cefe0d50447fbbf7c5faa	Eu tambem sou do signo de sagitario eu nem sei com qual signo eu combino, só sei que n?o me dou com o signo de aquario (e o meu namorado é desse signo, rsss) ahhh o meu ex tambem era de aquario, deve ser por isso que n?o deu certo, kkkkkkkkk|`|39e12397bce6b55e70ebbfb5fe2e6a26aa	Com você!

Porém, os amigos saber?o que n?o faz por mal, mas por pura ingenuidade. <br>  <br>  Ele é do tipo que chega num amigo e diz com a maior sinceridade: "Como você pode parecer t?o jovem quando é t?o velho?" Normalmente ele faz isto na frente de um monte de gente, e quando o amigo se prepara para apertar seu pesco?o ele consegue se sair com uma melhor do tipo: "Mas n?o se preocupe, pois as pessoas que chegam a sua idade com este corpo, demoram para morrer!" <br>  <br>  Ele vai dizer tudo isto com a maior sinceridade e com um sorriso enorme nos lábios. Mesmo n?o conseguindo entender como alguém pode ser t?o indiscreto, pode apostar que no fundo o sagitariano ainda pensa que esta fazendo um elogio ao citar a idade do amigo! <br>  <br>  N?o adianta ficar nervoso ou irritado com as gafes que o sagitariano comete por n?o costumar refletir antes de dar uma opini?o! <br>  Ele n?o tem malícia e suas observa??es parte do fundo de sua alma inocente. <br>  <br>  Normalmente ele costuma ser agitado do tipo que adora lugares lotados, bagun?a e muita festa. Adora falar e jamais se prende diante de uma boa discuss?o com os amigos ou com estranhos. <br>  <br>  Também é um idealista amável, quase sempre de bom humor e muito inteligente! Por outro lado adora a liberdade, detesta pessoas controladoras, n?o suportam que critiquem sua maneira de agir e podem partir de uma hora para outra se sentir que algo está faltando em sua vida. <br>  <br>  O sagitariano n?o analisa um relacionamento através das pessoas, mas sim, através do que sente vivendo uma situa??o.|`|lHTrFTvzaa	Elemento: Fogo, Mutável<br>  Planeta Regente: Júpiter<br>  Príncipio: Activo<br>  Parte do corpo: Quadris e Coxas<br>  Esta??o do ano: Fim do Outono no hemisfério norte<br>  Incensos: Canela e Rosa<br>  Pedras: Ametista<br>  Dia: Quinta<br>  Metal: Estanho<br>  C?r: Púrpura<br>  <br>  Personalidade do Sagitário: "Brinca comigo"<br>  <br>  Os Sagitários têm um signo engra?ado: metade cavalo, metade homem. Parece-se com um homem a tentar alcan?ar algo acima da sua natureza. Imaginem como seria difícil para uma criatura destas para manterem o balan?o. Escusado será dizer que os Sagitários s?o desastrados. Metem sempre o pé na argola: "N?o estou a dizer que estás a ficar gordo, na verdade o peso extra fica-te bem. Foste feito para isso". N?o é uma boa desculpa, mas vamos dar uma hipótese ao Sagitário. Eles n?o conseguem evitar serem brutalmente honestos. N?o sabem quando calar-se. N?o querem magoar-nos, simplesmente dizem-no exactamente como é. O Sagitário exagera um bocado. Peguem no que ele diz, adicionem um bocadinho de sal e fa?am-nos falar de coisas importantes. Filosofia e Religi?o podem ser assuntos bons. é sábio e fará com que o ou?amos horas a fio.<br>  <br>  AMIZADE<br>  Est?o sempre à procura de novos horizontes. Fazem amigos onde quer que v?o, desde o escritório à cafetaria. Se conseguirmos acompanhá-los, estar com eles é o máximo. Arrastam-nos para as mais novas discotecas e para o concerto mais quente na cidade.<br>  <br>  AMOR<br>  Logo de início, nenhum Sagitário actuará com qualquer tipo de restri??es na liberdade pessoal. Tentem pregar um ao ch?o, e vejam-nos fugir para a Terra do Nunca. Ficam aterrorizados quando se trata de responsabilidades, n?o se querem comprometer e o casamento n?o faz parte da sua lista de preferências. Ainda querem um Sagitário? Preparem-se para uma viagem selvagem. Eles gostam de pessoas espertas e sempre a postos como eles. Alguém que seja um companheiro de viagem, bem como um amante. Adoram aventuras, sedu??es e por vezes enganam. Quando o fazem, a sua natureza honesta assume o controlo, e dizem-nos o que se passou.|`|tHrbOuibaa	Sagitário é o 9o signo.

Tem uma grande influência em todo o trabalho que envolva aspectos corporativos, comércio internacional e representa??es. Júpiter é também um sinónimo de fraternidade e muitas vezes está associado ao factor sorte. é regente de Sagitário e co-regente de Peixes. A sua fun??o é o crescimento e a expans?o da personalidade e da vida. Cria o sonho que queremos realizar. No??o de moral, justi?a, dá senso de humor, optimismo, sensatez, sabedoria, benevolência, generosidade, tendência a conservar e defender o bem comum. Traz facilidades e oportunidades. Promove o relaxamento. Excessos, exageros, corrup??o, auto-indulgência, vaidade excessiva, autoritarismo, insiste em sonhos impossíveis. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  f<br>  <br>  <br>  Sagitário tem como símbolo a imagem do centauro Quiron, filho da oceanica Filira que Saturno conseguiu seduzir transformando-se num belo cavalo branco. Tal como Europa, Filira montou no animal que a raptou, levando-a para o monte Pelion. Desse amor nasceu Quiron, que foi amado pelos deuses e que, a despeito da sua metade animal, adquiriu tal ciência e sabedoria que a todos espantava. Heróis como Ulisses, Jas?o, Castor e Polux, Teseu, Esculápio e Aquiles, sentaram-se aos seus pés, para ouvi-lo e aprender. é por isso que Sagitário é o signo da cultura e do saber. Os sagitarianos gostam de aprender e ensinar. S?o inteligentes, leais e intuitivos. às vezes s?o gulosos e sensuais, sempre ávidos de amor e prazer. A flecha do centauro, apontado para o céu, n?o permite que eles se esque?am da sua origem divina.<br>  <br>  <br>  Júpiter, o maior planeta do sistema solar, n?o podia de forma alguma reger um signo mesquinho ou de qualidades medíocres.

O corpo tem tendência para ser entroncado, embora musculoso. Normalmente disp?e de grandes aptid?es para o desporto. N?o se preocupa demasiado com o aspecto físico, preferindo a roupa cómoda e informal. Têm alguma tendência para a obesidade. O seu optimismo reflecte-se na sua express?o. Os olhos, habitualmente claros e vivos, costumam ser afastados. Os lábios s?o firmes, quase sempre prontos para um sorriso.<br>  <br>  <br>  Com grande tendência para sentirem rapidamente a chama e a ilus?o da paix?o, os nativos deste signo s?o também propensos às decep??es e à frustra??o, o que n?o é motivo para n?o se lan?arem de cabe?a a novas experiências. Um amor para sempre? A vida oferece demasiadas maravilhas para se limitem a uma, o que n?o os impede de viverem cada um dos seus romances como se do definitivo se tratasse. N?o suportam amarras, pois aquilo a que d?o mais valor é à sua própria independência e, por isso, n?o costumam ser possessivos. Atraentes, elegantes e afáveis, fazem inúmeras conquistas e custa-lhes comprometerem-se. O seu par terá de encontrar, o que n?o será fácil, o equilíbrio entre as manifesta??es de afecto que exigem constantemente e a liberdade que lhes é vital, bem como evitar cenas de ciúme, que os deixam fora de si. O fundamental para um Sagitário consiste em desfrutar o amor com letra grande e ter a sensa??o de aventura, tudo reunido. Sair com amigos ou fazer de vez em quando uma viagem curta, sozinhos, permite-lhes fugir da rotina mais facilmente.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Sagitário pode mergulhar totalmente numa rela??o mas n?o se compromete facilmente. Adora a perspectiva de um novo romance e, muitas vezes, prefere rela??es casuais a algo mais permanente que lhe roube a liberdade. Apesar de muitas vezes preferir ser livre, quando se envolve numa rela??o, o Sagitário torna-la-á o mais divertida possível. O Sagitário é normalmente gregário, mas geralmente arranja tempo para uma rela??o amorosa importante. é quente e dedicado, ainda que a sua afei??o despreocupada possa parecer demasiado casual para alguns dos signos solares mais passionais, que preferem uma maior seguran?a. Como ca?ador do Zodíaco, n?o há nada de que o Sagitário mais goste do que a excita??o originada por uma ca?a romantica. Contudo, por vezes perde o interesse quando conquista finalmente o cora??o da pessoa que perseguia e desviará a sua aten??o para outra pessoa. A independência é vital para o Sagitário, que muito facilmente se pode sentir preso numa rela??o sufocante. A sua tendência para mudar constantemente de opini?o pode tornar a sua rela??o confusa. Normalmente possui sentimentos fortes adequados bem como uma grande alegria de viver, que muitas vezes é preenchida por inúmeros interesses totalmente absorventes. Optimista por natureza, tem a tendência para minimizar a derrota.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Sagitário, amante de liberdade, é um galanteador nato, que detesta estar muito tempo preso a uma rotina. é impetuoso e delira com encontros espontaneos e inflamados. Este signo é muito optimista, contudo, marchando alegremente para longe da última grande paix?o. Sagitário é o viajante do Zodíaco, o que pode ser entendido literalmente devido à sua paix?o pela explora??o de novos lugares e pessoas. De facto, a sua fantasia sexual preferida envolve certamente algum lugar exótico. Os nativos de Sagitário têm, é verdade, um impulso sexual forte, mas igualmente errático, necessitando de uma rela??o sexual viva e inventiva para manterem o seu interesse. Apesar de os signos do Fogo serem em geral impacientes, os Sagitários devotam tempo à explora??o mútua, tanto a nível físico como mental, como parte de um processo de envolvimento sexual. No entanto, n?o toleram a monotonia, em nenhuma circunstancia - principalmente na cama. Avisam-se os signos pouco enérgicos que os preliminares com um Sagitário podem transformar-se numa chama que arde durante horas. De facto, têm um apetite sexual de tal maneira voraz que já foi sugerido darem aos seus parceiros algum tipo de afrodisíaco, ginseng ou vitamina E, por exemplo, para que estas possam aguentar o ritmo! De qualquer forma, e devido à sua libido errática, seguir-se-á certamente um período de abstinência para recupera??o. Os signos sexualmente mais sensíveis devem ter cuidado com as observa??es do Sagitário, geralmente bem-intencionadas mas com pouco tacto.<br>  <br>  <br>  Com o seu amor pela liberdade e os espa?os abertos, n?o há nada de que os Sagitários gostem mais do que comer ao ar livre. Gostam de comida que encha e seja fácil de comer, como p?ezinhos recheados; e gostam de cozinhar com uma fogueira genuína - e n?o com um grelhador - no campo ou no praia. Os Sagitários, pessoas aventureiras e de trato fácil, n?o se interessam muito pela comida, excepto enquanto necessidade que lhes dá a energia para todas as coisas interessantes e activas em que se pode envolver. N?o têm paciência para inúteis preocupa??es com os por??es, acompanhamentos complicados, ou o prato que está na moda. Gostam de quantidades razoáveis de comida simples e de qualidade, como um guisado de carne, com muitas batatas cobertas de molho e com um bolo de frutas para a sobremesa. Os Sagitários também apreciam petiscos com muita substancia; e se estes forem bem tostados e estaladi?os, ou comidos ao ar livre, tanto melhor. Quando recebem visitas, é difícil saber o que esperar, já que podem ser muito descontraídos ou surpreendentemente formais. Assim, qualquer evento que organizam pode ser uma espontanea reuni?o de amigos, com roupas informais, ou estar planeado até ao mínimo pormenor. Apesar de os Sagitários, com frequência, terem um apetite como o do seu símbolo, o cavalo, o metabolismo geralmente eficiente dos signos do Fogo e o seu estilo de vida quase sempre activo evita que aumentem muito de peso, desde que n?o participem em demasiadas festas.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Sagitário é um signo de extremos. Alguns nativos vêem o dinheiro como a única coisa que pode garantir a sua liberdade, correndo por isso grandes riscos; outros encaram o dinheiro como inferior, gastando de forma irresponsável. "Eu procuro" é o lema do Sagitário: mas a busca é muitas vezes pela aventura, n?o pelo dinheiro. O símbolo do Sagitário é a flecha, apontando para o alto em busca do alvo. é a viagem que promete a aventura, n?o a chegada. O aborrecimento é, em boa medida, o arqui-inimigo do Sagitário; assim, o dinheiro em si mesmo é pouco atraente. Se desempenhar um papel de relevo nas suas vidas, está geralmente ligado a algum tipo de vis?o ou cren?a filosófica, ou poderá ser um meio para permitir ao Sagitário dar curso livre ao seu espírito de jogador. Claramente, qualquer coisa que bloqueie o horizonte do Sagitário está condenada. A rotina n?o os atrai; alguns s?o arrogantes o bastante para se recusarem a descer até ao nível em que alguns de nós ganham a vida. Se os nativos n?o encontrarem a emo??o que procuram através do seu talento, reúnem-se muitas vezes em redor daqueles que o conseguem fazer. N?o têm escrúpulos em utilizar o dinheiro e a influência de outras pessoas para subirem na vida; sentem que o mundo tem a obriga??o de lhes dar o que procuram. Quando se sentem felizes e interessados no seu trabalho, o seu potencial de lucro n?o conhece limites. Mas s?o extremamente esbanjadores e fracos organizadores das finan?as, gastando livremente quando podem e por vezes assumindo compromissos financeiros que n?o s?o capazes de honrar.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Sagitário é tradicionalmente conhecido pela sua energia e pelo seu amor ao desporto, mas pode igualmente ser pregui?oso, esperando que um físico naturalmente perfeito absorva os excessos de uma dieta descuidada. N?o é fácil p?r em forma um Sagitário descuidado, apesar do possível auxílio da acupunctura. O Sagitário aborda abertamente a vida, seja através de palavras, feitos ou mesmo hábitos alimentares. Adora a aventura e o que mais teme é poder ficar imobilizado pela doen?a. Mas a agita??o constante fá-lo gastar grandes reservas de energia, amea?ando a mobilidade que tanto preza. A tendência para oscilar entre o entusiasmo extasiante e a depress?o profunda pode muitas vezes parecer desproporcionada face aos eventos que despoletaram a situa??o, mas tal como outros signos do Fogo, o Sagitário n?o aceita bem os conselhos sobre os hábitos de saúde. Neste campo, o Sagitário é o seu pior inimigo, pois ao fazer pouco caso das suas preocupa??es pessoais e dos seus achaques, muitas vezes, na realidade, está oculta uma ansiedade sobre a sua saúde, bem como o medo secreto de que um dia a sua sorte possa acabar. Como se para testar o seu destino, o Sagitário afogará esta tortura mental comendo e bebendo durante longos períodos. Se isto se tornar um hábito, as áreas mais vulneráveis na anatomia do Sagitário - o fígado, as ancas e as coxas - poder?o igualmente sofrer com isso. O mais importante para o Sagitário é temperar a sua natureza exuberante com algum descanso e relaxe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Porque s?o consumidos por um desejo ardente de estudarem tudo no mundo, viram-se muitas vezes para o horizonte longínquo. Devem ter cuidado, para que o seu senso de aventura n?o lhes arranje problemas no estrangeiro. Muitos nativos de Sagitário, nascidos sob um mutável signo do Fogo, preocupam-se com a rela??o básica entre as leis do universo e o homem, viajando para muito longe em busca de respostas. Alguns dos maiores exploradores e viajantes do mundo s?o deste signo. Porque detestam estar presos, muitos Sagitários, viajam sozinhos, ou com apenas um companheiro. Viajantes natos, percorrem, muitas vezes, grandes distancias rapidamente. Tal como os outros dois signos do Fogo, tendem a gostar de transportes velozes, principalmente avi?es. Uma vez que as viagens s?o t?o instintivas para os Sagitários, as férias s?o apenas uma extens?o natural das suas vidas quotidianas. Têm geralmente muitas ideias interessantes, visitando locais que nunca ocorreriam a outras pessoas. Passar férias com um Sagitário será, provavelmente, uma experiência rica, excitante e inesquecível, uma vez que eles raramente abrandam o passo. Quem acompanha um Sagitário pode, com a mesma facilidade, encontrar-se no deserto do Sahara ou a visitar uma interessante igreja antiga. é provável que os Sagitários fa?am o seu próprio percurso de férias, n?o o deixando a cargo de uma agência de viagens.<br>  <br>  <br>  O Sagitário é um grande viajante e aventureiro, n?o só fisicamente mas também em espírito. é um signo que exige saber as respostas para as grandes quest?es da vida. Apesar de ser extremamente agradável quando encontra estas respostas, frustrar a sua busca pode dar problemas. LADO POSITIVO - Sagitário é um signo do Fogo, optimista, activo e adaptável. A personalidade do Sagitário procura interagir espontaneamente com a vida, ao longo da sua cruzada em busca de significado. O Sagitário precisa também de muita liberdade, estando igualmente disposto a dar essa liberdade aos outros. O Sagitários tem uma franca curiosidade intelectual, o que significa que está disposto a estudar as pessoas num esfor?o para as perceber, sendo aberta e de confian?a. O Sagitário diz exactamente o que pensa, com uma franqueza devastadora. LADO NEGATIVO - O Sagitário tem falta de tacto, gaba-se das suas proezas e, por vezes, pensa mais com a boca do que com a cabe?a, defeitos que tendem a irritar as outras pessoas. Igualmente irritante é a tendência do Sagitário para o discurso moralizador, dizendo aos outros o que fazer - sem, obviamente, seguir ele mesmo essas mesmas regras. Um dos pontos fracos do Sagitário s?o as rela??es. Tem muita facilidade em ser completamente fiel a duas pessoas ao mesmo tempo. E um Sagitário aborrecido é um perigo para todos. "Vale tudo" é a atitude, desde que a ache estimulante. Esta tendência para permitir tudo a si próprio leva-o a exageros, podendo prejudicar a sua saúde.<br>  <br>  <br>  Os Sagitários procuram a verdade e precisam de acreditar num poder superior a eles. Est?o muitas vezes interessados na combina??o do psíquico com o religioso; e podem sentir-se intrigados por religi?es ou cultos que se baseiam em ensinamentos oriundos de outras culturas. Sagitário, com os seus muitos interesses na vida ao ar livre, senso de humor por vezes discreto e falta de subtileza, pode ser um signo surpreendentemente psíquico. Isto acontece talvez porque o elemento Fogo lhe dá uma certa quantidade de intui??o e prontid?o para aceitar novas ideias, o que é acentuado pelo facto de este ser essencialmente um signo mutável. Pertencendo a um signo muito interessado pela filosofia e a religi?o no seu sentido mais lato, os nativos de Sagitário procuram a verdade com mentes naturalmente curiosas e uma tendência para o pouco convencional - tudo elementos que tendem a fazê-los interessados no paranormal. Os Sagitários s?o naturalmente proféticos. Fazem frequentemente comentários que parecem ser casuais mas que acabam por ter um significado extraordinário. Para além destas afirma??es inesperadas, os Sagitários atingem os seus máximos psíquicos quando se sentem livres e sem restri??es, talvez ao ar livre. Os factos científicos atraem os Sagitários, mas gostam igualmente de mitos antigos, sendo atraídos com frequência para religi?es ou cultos de outras paragens. O trabalho de vedor e o estudo de antigos locais religiosos também os interessa, bem como actividades mais arriscadas, como o andar em cima de brasas (que n?o se recomenda para experiências).<br>  <br>  <br>  A presen?a dos Sagitários parece estar cheia de sede de viver; há sempre algo neste signo que é grande e expansivo. Se n?o é o seu porte físico ou as suas partidas, pode facilmente ser a boca, já que os Sagitários s?o conhecidos por às vezes falarem demais. Tal como o centauro que este signo representa, os Sagitários combinam os ideias mais avan?ados com o comportamento mais irreflectido. De certa maneira, isto descreve perfeitamente o seu tipo físico: apesar de terem uma pose altiva, os Sagitários s?o algo trapalh?es nos seus movimentos. O corpo é bem proporcionado, com ombros largos e fortes, costas longas, ancas estreitas e pernas poderosas. Os efeitos da sua "fome de viver", contudo, s?o muitas vezes visíveis em redor da cintura. A express?o do rosto dos Sagitários é agradável; os seus tra?os abertos e bem-dispostos s?o um livro aberto. Isto pode ser positivo ou negativo, já que os nativos deste signo s?o conhecidos pela sua falta de tacto. Nos seus olhos, porém, n?o há qualquer sinal de malícia. Os homens Sagitário parecem fisicamente duros, com corpos que facilmente ganham músculo ou gordura. Por vezes podem parecer desleixados e o corpo ressente-se disso. A típica mulher Sagitário é pequena, bem proporcionada, inquieta e airosa. IDENTIFICAR UM SAGITáRIO - Característica do Sagitário é um rosto oval comprido, com uma testa alta e larga. Os olhos ternos mas em alerta s?o amendoados; a boca é generosa e sorridente.<br>  <br>  <br>  Os Sagitários dizem sempre o que pensam e nunca medem as palavras. S?o muito honestos nas suas opini?es e n?o particularmente sensíveis ao exprimi-las. Na verdade, se tentam agir com tacto acabam por piorar as coisas, dizendo gaffes clássicas como "Estás linda - para a tua idade." Os Sagitários s?o naturalmente amigáveis. Poderá encontrar, ocasionalmente, um Sagitário tímido, talvez influenciado por um ascendente reservado. Mas, como regra, falam fácil e naturalmente com toda a gente que encontram. Gostam de ter muitos amigos à sua roda para suprirem as suas necessidades de variedade e de independência. Isto significa que nenhum amigo se torna demasiado próximo e que eles preservam a sua liberdade de escolherem o amigo que querem, quando querem. Os Sagitários s?o muito calorosos, bem dispostos e optimista. S?o o tipo de amigos a quem se pode telefonar quando estamos em baixo e que nos faz sentir melhor e que nos faz sentir melhor; embora algumas pessoas, de signos mais sensíveis, possam achá-los demasiado francos ou com falta de tacto. Os Sagitários insistem que todos os amigos s?o directos e honestos com eles, e que têm deles a mesma ideia. COMPATIBILIDADE - Os Sagitários têm, com frequência, uma grande variedade de amigos casuais, escolhidos principalmente entre outros signos do Fogo ou do Ar . Cada amigo é escolhido para servir em diferentes ocasi?es. Os Sagitários podem ser algo desligados e nem sempre sentem a necessidade de amizades duradouras.<br>  <br>  <br>  O homem Sagitário é um grande idealista, constantemente ocupado com projectos que nem sequer sabe p?r em prática. De espírito aventureiro, gosta de desafios e de viajar para lugares exóticos e longínquos. Igualmente aventureiro no amor, é-lhe muito difícil ser fiel na sua rela??o.<br>  O homem Sagitário é apaixonado e generoso nos seus sentimentos. Pertence ao elemento Fogo e o seu impulso é mutável, pelo que se sentirá atraído pelas paix?es variadas e selvagens. N?o é de modo algum um homem que aceite cair facilmente na rotina ou no tédio, necessitando constantemente de renovar as suas experiências. Quando isto n?o acontece é muito provável que se sinta tentado a mudar de parceira, a procurar outra pessoa que esteja disposta a compartilhar com ele novas aventuras. O homem Sagitário pode misturar a filosofia com o amor o que o levará a adoptar um conceito muito particular sobre a sexualidade. Isto n?o significa que n?o seja muito terra-a-terra. Apesar da sua ideologia e da sua procura do sublime, poucos nativos s?o t?o práticos e t?o predispostos a mudar a vida como os de Sagitário , signo que possui a faculdade de poder reunir estas duas facetas. Ter um amor em cada porto, sentindo-se Marco Polo em busca de aventura e do amor, pode muito bem ser uma das suas fantasias favoritas.<br>  <br>  A mulher Sagitário é pouco realista, prefere continuar no seu mundo de grandes ambi??es e eterno optimismo. Acredita profundamente que Deus, as estrelas ou seja o que for est?o do seu lado. Gosta de ser ela a mandar nas suas rela??es afectivas e n?o pretende renunciar à sua preciosa independência, pois é uma verdadeira amante da liberdade. às vezes é precipitada.<br>  A mulher Sagitário é a nativa aventureira do Zodíaco, para ela o amor e a sexualidade s?o aventura, uma maravilhosa aventura cheia de experiências enriquecedoras e prazenteiras. As palavras carência ou restri??o n?o entram no seu vocabulário amoroso. P?e entusiasmo e paix?o em tudo quanto faz. Se te assustam a franqueza e a naturalidade, n?o fazes nada ao lado desta nativa que n?o é das que se envergonham no momento de expressar e demonstrar os seus sentimentos e desejos. O comportamento da mulher Sagitário está muito longe de ser um comportamento puritano; n?o é das que caem em falsos recatos. N?o terás que recorrer à imagina??o, nem a um detective para conhecer as suas inten??es: se lhas perguntares, dir-tas-á, simplesmente. Sagitário rege a regi?o das ancas e das coxas, pelo que as ditas regi?es s?o especialmente sensíveis ao tacto nesta nativa.<br>  <br>  <br>  A mulher Sagitário tem "qualquer coisa"; um ar de "ra?a apurada", elegancia, uma presen?a física forte e mais encanto ainda que beleza. Reconhecemo-la muitas vezes pelo seu porte, pela sua maneira de andar, pela forma como se mantém direita, pelo modo provocante como fixa as pessoas. Nunca baixa os olhos. Estes s?o, em geral, belos, claros, com sobrancelhas altas mas horizontais. O nariz é direito, n?o muito comprido, bonito. A boca grande, com dentes regulares, muitas vezes compridos. O busto é curto, as coxas compridas, anda com leveza; desprende-se do conjunto um ar de saúde e franqueza, um ar de equilíbrio, desportivo e desenvolto. O rosto, risonho, pode ensombrar-se de repente, sob o efeito duma emo??o ou dum pensamento melancólico; podemos ver a tempestade a avolumar-se nos seus olhos muito expressivos... A mulher Sagitário passa rapidamente do riso para as lágrimas, da serenidade para a cólera, da do?ura para a brutalidade. Uma característica desconcertante que os seus amantes temem. Possui vitalidade, tem prazer no desgaste físico; a ociosidade deprime-a.<br>  <br>  <br>  As suas predisposi??es patológicas s?o semelhantes às do homem do signo; fígado frágil, vesícula biliar nervosa, frequentes reac??es alérgicas, sempre ligadas a emo??es, a contrariedades, a cóleras reprimidas ou a decep??es. Tem a sorte, sobretudo na juventude, de gostar do seu corpo, de o aceitar sem problemas; aliás, sabe servir-se dele, dan?a com um instinto seguro e um sentido inato do ritmo, com gra?a e uma forma de "sensualidade para ela própria", pelo prazer de sentir a música e o movimento. Mas deve preocupar-se com a linha porque tende facilmente para o tipo "Juno"; bem constituída, é certo, mas também com bastante carne. O desporto e o exercício físico assim como um regime alimentar pouco apertado podem, por si sós, evitar-lhe a celulite, o seu inimigo no 1. E como costuma consolar-se, quando a vida lhe corre mal, petiscando gulodices ricas em calorias, que adora, vemos que a luta é renhida... Por desgra?a, as emo??es agu?am-lhe o apetite em vez de lhe tirarem a fome! Tem um humor instável, tal como o nativo; é, mais ainda que ele, atreita a depress?es que se sucedem a estados de euforia. Por vezes "explode" em cóleras bruscas, grita e entrega-se a manifesta??es "histéricas". Existe em todos os Sagitários - homens e mulheres - "um Júpiter trovejante" armado com o seu raio, pois n?o é em v?o que Júpiter domina o signo... Também ela necessita de uma vida s?, calma sem situa??es confusas e sobretudo dum equilíbrio físico e moral que consegue gra?as a um mínimo de actividade física, dum número regular de horas de sono e duma alimenta??o sempre controlada. Com um excesso de vez em quando para satisfazer a gulodice e alimentar a sua alegria de viver. à semelhan?a do homem Sagitário, evitará todos os alimentos demasiado gordos e pesados, a pastelaria, a torta de amêndoa - que faz perder a cabe?a - o p?o, as massas, tudo o que engorda muito. Poderá, em compensa??o, comer carnes grelhadas, saladas - n?o muitas - legumes verdes (aten??o às azedas e aos espinafres, muito ricos em ácido exáltico), tomates, mel?o, beterrabas, etc., assim como crustáceos e aves no espeto. Para a digest?o, à noite, em vez dum copo de álcool deverá tomar uma infus?o de tomilho, de alecrim ou de mentol. Se n?o tiver coragem para fazer ginástica, deverá optar pela dan?a moderna, pela equita??o ou pela nata??o.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tem personalidade e carácter. Por vezes, pode parecer um pouco pedante ou peremptória; as pessoas acham-na pouco simples. De facto, leva o seu tempo a encontrar o equilíbrio. Num mundo dirigido por homens, n?o se sente à vontade porque quer competir em direitos com eles, quer provar aquilo de que é capaz, afirmar a sua independência e, sobretudo, demonstrar que em caso nenhum podem considerá-la um objecto. Nessa altura, ataca ou defende-se e, sobretudo na juventude, n?o tem humor suficiente para conseguir sair-se airosamente de certas situa??es. Esfor?a-se demais ou p?e em tudo uma perfei??o exagerada, e n?o espera com paciência pela sua vez. A impaciência e a susceptibilidade constituem, aliás, os seus fracos. Tem uma natureza orgulhosa e n?o cede facilmente. Acusá-la-?o de ser demasiado "convencida" ou teimosa, na juventude. Quer ter raz?o a todo o custo e n?o lhe falta impertinência nem coragem para defender as suas opini?es. Aliás, conservará essas características toda a vida. Simplesmente, o carácter ado?a-se e a filosofia surge com a indulgência. E se triunfar na vida, sente-se forte e adquire bom senso.<br>  <br>   Possui um espírito curioso, interessa-se por muitas coisas, pelo mundo em geral... A sua avidez intelectual parece insaciável. Forma grandes projectos, sonha e consegue convencer os que a rodeiam, t?o grande é a fé que a anima. Quando lhe tocamos a fibra sensível, com gestos generosos e aten??es delicadas é uma mulher corajosa e cheia de encanto, mas n?o se enternece facilmente: diz muitas vezes: "Querer é poder" e despreza em segredos os fracos e os impotentes, os cobardes e os imbecis. Atravessa momentos de profundo desencorajamento em que julga a humanidade - e a ela própria - com um desprezo selvagem.<br>  Se luta pela igualdade absoluta com o homem, é porque se sente capaz de fazer as mesmas coisas que ele.<br>  <br>   Intelectualmente, n?o se apercebe de qualquer inferioridade. E, de facto, faz frente com facilidade a todos os homens que exercem a mesma profiss?o que ela. De resto, interessa-se pela política e manifesta talento nesse domínio. Mulher moderna e dinamica, vive com o seu tempo e defende as ideias que lhe parecem justas e saudáveis. Se optar pela pedagogia ou pela psicologia, pelo ensino ou pelo jornalismo, fá-lo-á animada dum espírito de reforma, com fé lutando mais por um resultado real do que pelo sucesso pessoal. Mas é sensível aos cumprimentos e mais sensível ainda às censuras. Encontramos na mulher Sagitário os mesmos gostos e aptid?es que no homem do signo, o mesmo espírito de aventura e um desejo constante de aumentar os seus conhecimentos e de desenvolver as suas aptid?es profissionais. Em geral, consegue-o. Por vezes, até em detrimento da sua vida privada.<br>  <br>  <br>  A mulher Sagitário ama os homens, mas faz-lhes medo. Estes consideram-na uma "amazona", uma "mulher fálica" e ela acusa-os de raramente atingirem a qualidade que sonha encontrar neles. Quando muito jovem e forte como é, atrai os fracos e os "estropiados" que procura ajudar por todos os meios, esperando salvá-los ou modificá-los. Terá que aprender à sua custa que os fracos nuca se levantam, pelo contrário, eles é que nos arrastam sempre "para baixo". Mais tarde, conhecerá tempos difíceis, porque quer conciliar tudo: o amor, a carreira, t?o importantes para ela, a vida familiar. N?o deveria ligar-se sen?o a um homem inteligente e, também ele, muito independente que a ajudasse na sua profiss?o tal como ela o ajuda na dele... desde que n?o seja a mesma. A maior parte das vezes encontra o equilíbrio casando com um artista "falido" que ajudará a viver; moverá céus e terras para que o talento dele seja reconhecido; a glória que ele alcan?a reflectir-se-á também nela e isso basta-lhe. Tem uma faceta Pigmale?o; considera mais importante dar à luz homens ao nível do cora??o e do espírito, do talento e do génio, que fazê-los do ponto de vista físico. Quando opta pela via conformista, a mulher Sagitário torna-se uma dona de casa impecável, uma m?e de família perfeita e uma esposa dedicada, fazendo tudo para servir os interesses do marido e ajudá-lo a vencer na vida. A Igreja ajudá-la-á de certa maneira quando atravessar momentos de revolta ou quando o desejo de aventuras lhe assaltar o espírito...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  O que lhe ensinam os outros signos:<br>  <br>  <br>  Carneiro - associam-se para a aventura. Complementam-se mutuamente.<br>  Touro - o valor da fidelidade e da constancia e o prazer pelas coisas simples.<br>  Gémeos - a reparar nos pormenores.

Seu otimismo e sua sinceridade s?o marcas registradas. Além disso, faz de tudo para superar obstáculos, pois n?o consegue encarar o baixo-astral, especialmente nos assuntos pessoais. No amor, sua franqueza desperta a simpatia de quem está ao seu lado. Você sabe fazer festa para conquistar quem deseja e, quando vê o menor sinal de interesse da pessoa, vai logo espalhando a alegria para chamar a aten??o. Pintou interesse, seu cora??o bate acelerado e você n?o tem medo de encarar. Agora, uma coisa que n?o tolera é gente pegando no seu pé. <br>  Elemento: Fogo<br>  Astro regente: Júpiter<br>  Paraíso astral: áries (2/3 a 20/4)<br>  Santo: Santa Bárbara<br>  Anjo: Saquiel<br>  Flores: Geranio e Violeta  Números: 3 e 9<br>  Talism?s: Figa e Olho-de-cabra<br>  Pedras: Topázio e Sodalita<br>  Dias: Ter?a e Quinta-feira<br>  Essências: Violeta e Jasmim<br>  Verbo: "Eu vejo"<br>   <br>  CURIOSIDADES<br>  sagitário tem a fun??o de espalhar e acomodar, adaptando as descobertas feitas em Escorpi?o a um mundo mais amplo. De todos os signos do Zodíaco, este é o que mais deseja alargar a vis?o, fugindo do mundo fechado do Escorpi?o. Vem daí a necessidade, t?o natural nesse signo, de viajar. <br>  <br>  Ele precisa testar as verdades do Escorpi?o e tem que colocar em prática a propaganda do que acredita. Assim, o sagitariano quer sempre mais e melhor. De quebra, faz tudo com generosidade e alegria, porque n?o deseja guardar suas descobertas, precisa reparti-las com a comunidade. <br>  <br>  Sua natureza é essencialmente propagadora e otimista. A for?a da fé e do espírito (é um signo do elemento Fogo) é tanta que Sagitário pode esquecer do corpo. A n?o ser quando se dedica aos esportes, pois é um signo gregário que adora fazer algo em grupo. <br>  <br>  Sua inteligência se manifesta em todos os campos e ele sabe se adaptar às circunstancias mais inóspitas. Tanto que acaba dispersando suas energias em projetos mirabolantes que jamais se concretizam, o que faz com que o sagitariano fique melancólico. <br>  <br>  Este é um signo justiceiro, que luta pelos fracos e oprimidos, mas que também imp?e a lei e gosta de fazer justi?a com seu exemplo e seu julgamento. Nas competi??es, estabelece estratégias brilhantes - um recurso particularmente importante no esporte. <br>  <br>  Na saúde, Sagitário rege as coxas e o fêmur, pois as pernas fazem caminhar e ganhar os grandes espa?os que as m?os (regidas pelo signo oposto, Gêmeos) n?o alcan?am. O fígado é um órg?o que antigamente se relacionava com expans?o, um tema do Sagitário por excelência. Por vezes, o sagitariano se descuida do corpo, pois o fogo do entusiasmo é maior que tudo. Depois, exauridos pelos excessos de todas as ordens, o organismo se desequilibra. Dietas apropriadas servem para restaurar a harmonia. <br>  <br>  Nas profiss?es, Sagitário se destaca na propaganda, porque é um divulgador nato, e na editora??o, pelas mesmas raz?es. Mas também se dá bem com o direito - porque detesta a injusti?a. Como a vida ao ar livre entusiasma e faz bem ao seu vigor, ele também gosta de esportes. Profiss?es relacionadas com espiritualidade também o encantam, pois Sagitário sabe usufruir o melhor social da comunidade e se dá bem na transmiss?o das informa??es - mas é legalista e tende à reforma mais do que à revolu??o. <br>  <br>  No amor, ele quer explorar, conhecer e saciar a curiosidade, mais do que a estabilidade e a rotina. Sagitário almeja o mundo livre do espírito e com isso vai passando pela vida, colecionando grandes amores, sem contudo se fixar em nenhum. Isso até pode acontecer, mas é raro. O sagitariano quer viver paix?es estremecedoras e é fiel de uma maneira mais filosófica, do que sexual. <br>  <br>  Seu elemento é o Fogo; suas pedras s?o o berilo e o quartzo verde; seu metal é o estanho; suas cores s?o o azul-real e o azul-arroxeado e o verde-azulado profundo. <br>  <br>  Regente: Júpiter. <br>  <br>  SAGITáRIO E OUTROS SIGNOS<br>  <br>  SAGITáRIO X   áRIES<br>  A uni?o de dois signos de fogo com uma intensidade enorme, só poderá resultar em fogo de paix?o imenso. Uma rela??o com muita lealdade e extremo senso de coopera??o. Nas rela??es afetivas precisará de um certo tempo para estabilizar tanto fogo. Profissionalmente é uma ótima combina??o, só faltando um pouco de praticidade. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   TOURO<br>  A amizade tende a ser longa e duradoura. O animado sagitariano dá mais movimento à vida do calmo taurino. Quando se trata de rela??es afetivas, talvez o taurino n?o agüente a necessidade de aventura e liberdade do Sagitário. Com seu ciúme e possessividade tende a espantar o sagitariano em pouco tempo. Só se o taurino mudar e confiar mais. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   GêMEOS<br>  Como ambos têm o mesmo temperamento aventureiro e descomplicado, é uma rela??o que pode dar muito certo, em todos os sentidos. Desencanados por natureza, o relacionamento estará baseado na amizade e no companheirismo. No relacionamento afetivo pode ocorrer um certo distanciamento por parte do geminiano, mas os la?os de amizade superam tudo. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   C?NCER<br>  Toda rela??o é baseada em amor e compreens?o, e cada um deve ceder um pouco para conviver melhor com o outro. Apegado ao passado e muito romantico, o canceriano poderá sentir-se rejeitado pelo apaixonado sagitariano que com o passar do tempo n?o movimenta??o na rela??o. A amizade entre eles pode resultar numa melhor rela??o. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   LE?O<br>  Sendo os dois signos de fogo e apaixonados e romanticos, pode existir uma rela??o de amor e afinidade incríveis. Talvez o sagitariano n?o aceite t?o facilmente o autoritarismo natural do Le?o, t?o egocêntrico quanto o Sagitário. Moderando sua impulsividade o sagitariano pode conviver muito bem com o leonino, tanto afetiva como profissionalmente. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   VIRGEM<br>  O pacato e discreto virginiano pode se assustar um pouco com a extrovers?o e a alegria naturais do Sagitário. O conformismo e a humildade de Virgem costuma incomodar o t?o elétrico e desencanado Sagitário. Mesmo assim pode haver uma atra??o pela praticidade do Virgem, o que colabora para o Sagitário realizar seus sonhos e projetos. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   LIBRA<br>  Uma uni?o bastante saudável que pode durar muito tempo, podendo ser uma rela??o afetiva ou profissionalmente enriquecedora. Bastante sociáveis ter?o momentos de muita felicidade junto aos amigos que tanto prezam. Muito mais compreensivo, o libriano terá mais condi??es de se adaptar ao exagerado e extrovertido Sagitário. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   ESCORPI?O<br>  Muito intensos nos relacionamentos, a paix?o é inevitável. Após os contatos iniciais a paix?o se torna amor e companheirismo, mas o sagitariano pode se incomodar com o controle e o ciúme doentio que pode se manifestar no escorpiano frente à extrovers?o e facilidade com que o Sagitário estabelece contatos com as pessoas. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   SAGITáRIO<br>  Uma uni?o em que a amizade será o maior trunfo para tornar a rela??o mais duradoura. Um fogo de paix?o enorme pode existir no início da rela??o. Troca de opini?es sobre quest?es filosóficas e éticas podem produzir altos papos. Isso pode levar a constantes confrontos e minar a rela??o. Profissionalmente pode ocorrer maior afinidade, ajudando na parceria. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   CAPRICóRNIO<br>  O brincalh?o e extrovertido sagitariano n?o costuma receber bem a sisudez e a cautela do Capricórnio numa rela??o afetiva. Com o convívio pode ocorrer maior proximidade. Com sua tendência a cobrar responsabilidades, o capricorniano pode irritar e afastar o Sagitário. Profissionalmente é uma excelente combina??o, produtiva e criativa. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   AQUáRIO<br>  Uma rela??o bastante harmoniosa, o que pode resultar em um casal alegre e moderno, sendo divertido e descomplicado. Muito idealistas, est?o sempre abertos a novos rumos e novas formas de amar e entender o mundo. Sempre esperando bastante um do outro, pode existir uma expectativa muito grande que pode ocasionar decep??es com o tempo. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   PEIXES<br>  O pisciano responde bem aos sonhos e desejos de aventura do Sagitário. Tendo sua liberdade preservada e suas fantasias incentivadas o sagitariano sente bastante afeto pelo pisciano, que responde com amor e aten??o. Pode faltar senso de praticidade e muitos de seus sonhos caírem no vazio por falta de um embasamento maior.  <br>  <br>  Espero ter te ajudado, mas caso ainda ouver dúvidas entre nos sites abaixo:neles você n?o só encontra-rá os signos mais também runas,numerologia,sonhos,feng shui, búzios, horócopo chinês, quiromancia, tar?....nunca entre de cabe?a em apenas um site,  quando for ver seu signo entre em dois,trés para ver se dá certo mesmo....<br>  www.joaobidu.com.br<br>  www.aparecidaliberato.com.br<br>  www.uol.com.br<br>  www.terra.com.br<br>  www.somostodosum.com.br<br>  www.signoseastrologia.com.br<br>  www.google.com.br [pesquise signos]   <br>  <br>  ***bye***|`|01b42414c09b0bb74f3241a4a752edb3aa	Minha experiencia e vis?o dos sagitarianos:<br>  Alegres!

Tal como Europa, Filira montou no animal que a raptou, levando-a para o monte Pelion. Desse amor nasceu Quiron, que foi amado pelos deuses e que, a despeito da sua metade animal, adquiriu tal ciência e sabedoria que a todos espantava. Heróis como Ulisses, Jas?o, Castor e Polux, Teseu, Esculápio e Aquiles, sentaram-se aos seus pés, para ouvi-lo e aprender. é por isso que Sagitário é o signo da cultura e do saber. Os sagitarianos gostam de aprender e ensinar. S?o inteligentes, leais e intuitivos. às vezes s?o gulosos e sensuais, sempre ávidos de amor e prazer. A flecha do centauro, apontado para o céu, n?o permite que eles se esque?am da sua origem divina.<br>  <br>  Sagitário foge da rotina, porque almeja o mundo livre do espírito e com isso vai passando pela vida, colecionando grandes amores, sem contudo se fixar em nenhum. às vezes pode acontecer, caso existam fatores astrológicos na carta mais estabilizantes, mas é raro. Paix?es estremecedoras, grande vontade de viver sonhos, forte sensualidade, e uma fidelidade antes de tudo filosófica, mais do que sexual.<br>  <br>  S?o pessoas ativas e combativas com muita for?a vital. Pode conhecer parceiros de outros países ou mesmo em uma viagem ter alguns envolvimentos afetivos com estrangeiros. Caso n?o viaje para fora do país poderá conhecer parceiros de outros estados e cidades. O excesso de sinceridade pode fazer com que percam alguns parceiros no decorrer de sua vida afetiva. Isto geralmente ocorre quando se relacionam com pessoas do elemento água ( cancer, escorpi?o ou peixes ), que s?o muito emotivos.<br>  <br>  O ato sexual<br>  <br>  No ato sexual s?o selvagens. A liga??o com a natureza e com a figura de um cavalo, que é o símbolo do Centauro, meio cavalo meio homem gera uma postura animal em que o suor e o calor do momento do prazer, dosado com movimentos quase bruscos. Neste palco do amor n?o deve faltar espa?o para poderem galopar nas redomas esfuziantes de sua libido. O parceiro deve ter muito f?lego para suportar seu ímpeto. é comum camas, cadeiras, copos e objetos serem alvos do seu jeito espa?oso de se expressar entre quatro paredes.<br>  <br>  Sagitário, o nono signo do zodíaco inicia-se, no hemisfério norte, no fim do outono, quando o trabalho do campo já se encerrou em fun??o da proximidade do inverno, e as pessoas passavam a depender mais da ca?a.<br>  <br>  é o signo das viagens e das explora??es. Como um n?made que vai aonde encontra alimento, o sagitariano é independente. O signo corresponde também à busca do conhecimento mais profundo, sobre os outros e sobre o mundo.<br>  A expans?o de suas habilidades, especialmente mentais, fundamenta-se na aspira??o de transcender sua própria condi??o humana. Benevolência e generosidade s?o marcas características de Sagitário. Elas s?o personalidades bonachonas. Adoram festas e costumam ser ótimos convivas. Gostam de contar piadas, bem como de discutir quest?es filosóficas. Têm, de fato, uma cabedal de assuntos dos mais variados, pois pensar e refletir sobre o universo é uma das coisas que mais tendem a fazer.<br>  <br>  Em rela??es amorosas gostam de independência. Sua natureza exploratória pode levá-los a serem infiéis.<br>  <br>  A mulher de Sagitário ama a liberdade e é totalmente independente, encarando a vida com muita garra. Alegre e cativante, costuma ser muito romantica, alimentando sonhos e fantasias de amor, mesmo sendo assim t?o independente e aparentemente difícil de encarar uma vida a dois. O que na realidade ela gosta é de uma parceria inteligente e que lhe dê liberdade e carinho ao mesmo tempo.<br>  <br>  Normalmente s?o exuberantes, com uma beleza que chama a aten??o. Claro que ela cativa também pela sua simpatia, e isto ela tem de sobra. Essa liberdade e extrovers?o da sagitariana costuma assustar alguns os homens acostumados com o modelo de mulher meiga e doce. Elas também s?o, mas preferem ficar por aí, preservando sua independência. é ótimo se relacionar com essas sagitarianas, que podem ser muitas mulheres ao mesmo tempo : doces e suaves, inteligentes e cultas, romanticas e fogosas.|`|c4fd527203e1047755505f8b4688d447aa	EU TB QUERO SABER COMBINA COM ESCORPIAO?SE SIM ME LIGA TA ?.....RS BJS|`|9aa7d6b162281996f58f4bf8c4fbfc3eaa	nos sabemos q os sagitarianos sao demais!!!!!!! sou uma!!!!!!!!! nos somos legais!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bfea22f2c7bbca893a6e6bbd14ded211aa	ele esta bem e te mandou um beijo e lembran?as, shiiiiiiiiii!<br>  mais ele falou escondido do capricórnio, para ele n?o ficar com ciumes!|`|d161d401d4a3cd598a0fee22ac2b3cd4aa	Planeta Regente: Júpiter <br>      Elemento: Fogo<br>     <br>      Qualidade: Mutável<br>      Polaridade: Positivo<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  Sagitarianos est?o sempre em busca da melhor op??o, nunca descartando nenhuma alternativa. Por isso, pode m ser um pouco relutantes em assumir um compromisso sério e s?o ainda piores para casamentos. <br>  Ao mesmo tempo em que tem medo de se comprometer, alguma coisa em sua alma lhe diz que ele tem necessidade de seguran?a. Isso é um consolo para aqueles que se apaixonaram por um sagitariano; eles geralmente voltam para o lar, ou seja, ele pode ter um relacionamento estável e continuar em sua infinita busca pelo novo em outros parceiros/as. <br>  Sagitário n?o é um signo que pode ser domado, e é melhor você nem tentar. O melhor que você pode fazer é lhe dar a liberdade que ele precisa e deixar claro que ele pode ser sempre ele mesmo com você.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  O bom-senso e otimismo dos sagitarianos os transforma em ótimos parceiros para o trabalho em grupo. Apostar em novos projetos e realiza??es é a maior característica desse signo, que imprime ao seu trabalho uma vis?o mais futurista. <br>  <br>  A mente do sagitariano associa sua lógica com sua imagina??o e o faz ter uma inteligência poderosa, fincada no que há de real, mas capaz de enxergar longe. Pessoas que nascem sob o signo de Sagitário têm um ótimo discernimento dos problemas. Sua esperan?a e fé na vida faz dele um persistente. <br>  <br>  Nativos de Sagitário podem ser bons advogados, ou embaixadores. Sua sensibilidade agu?ada favorece o campo das artes, como a fotografia. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  Sagitário, o nono signo do zodíaco inicia-se, no hemisfério norte, no fim do outono, quando o trabalho do campo já se encerrou em fun??o da proximidade do inverno, e as pessoas passavam a depender mais da ca?a. é o signo das viagens e das explora??es. Como um n?made que vai aonde encontra alimento, o sagitariano é independente. O signo corresponde também à busca do conhecimento mais profundo, sobre os outros e sobre o mundo. A expans?o de suas habilidades, especialmente mentais, fundamenta-se na aspira??o de transcender sua própria condi??o humana. Benevolência e generosidade s?o marcas características de Sagitário.

Têm, de fato, uma cabedal de assuntos dos mais variados, pois pensar e refletir sobre o universo é uma das coisas que mais tendem a fazer. <br>  <br>  Expandir os próprios horizontes é um impulso natural. Eles podem dedicar-se a isto de diversas formas, através da religi?o, viagens, filosofia, estudos superiores... Em todas estas formas veremos que o fim último é o próprio auto-conhecimento. <br>  <br>  Sua voca??o acadêmica esconde uma natureza pouco prática. De t?o fascinados que s?o por assuntos etéreos e místicos, tornam-se muito desorganizados. Vivem adiando os compromissos, pois n?o conseguem bem se ater um cronograma. Há quem os considere muito irresponsáveis. Todos os aspectos mais triviais da vida parecem, para eles, pouco interessantes. Se pudessem, ficariam a todo instante a pensar em suas aspira??es. Sua franqueza também é irritante, especialmente quando investem-se da tarefa de pregar e ensinar o que sabem sobre o mundo, mesmo àqueles que n?o querem aprender. <br>  <br>  S?o pessoas muito sortudas. Parece que a natureza lhes deu (e continuamente dá) inúmeras oportunidades. Têm possibilidade de sucesso em inúmeros campos da vida, dos negócios à vida reclusa do monastério. Em todos estes campos, a expans?o e o crescimento (da empresa, de sua grandeza etc.) ser?o as conquistas mais marcantes deles. <br>  <br>  Em rela??es amorosas gostam de independência. Sua natureza exploratória pode levá-los a serem infiéis. Em geral, n?o sentir?o qualquer remorso quanto a isso, já que costumam separar bem o amor de suas aventuras passageiras. <br>  <br>  Na mitologia o signo de Sagitário é representado por um centauro armado com arco, que aponta sua fecha para o céu. Os centauros s?o animais meio homem, meio cavalo. O lado homem ergue-se sobre as patas de um animal e aspira sobremaneira espiritualizar-se, negando a parte inferior de seu corpo. A parte animal reage, tornando-o estúpido e grosseiro quando se perde o controle. Esta parte animal também dá aos sagitarianos a tendência a embriagar-se e se entregar-se ao seus instintos mais baixos, vez por outra. <br>  <br>  Seu elemento é o fogo, como em áries e Le?o. No seu caso, trata-se de um fogo sagrado, uma chama da espiritualidade que o ati?a por dentro e os movem a ideais superiores. Somente quando conseguem conscientizar-se de sua dupla natureza animal e humana, sua flecha torna-se a proje??o de sua vida no céu: o elo que lhes permite transcender-se; que os une à sabedoria cósmica a que tanto almejam. <br>  <br>  <br>  Estrela Guia: Antares<br>  Cor: Azul<br>  Amor: Arrojado<br>  Virtude: Justi?a<br>  Vício: Gula<br>  Sentido: Supra consciência<br>  Compatibilidades: áries e Le?o<br>  Incompatibilidades: Gêmeos, Virgem e Peixes<br>  Metal: Estanho<br>  Pedra: Turqueza<br>  Corpo: coxas<br>  Dia da semana: Quinta-feira<br>  Plantas: Aspargo e Figueira<br>  Inteligência: Filosófica<br>  Caráter: Colérico-expansivo<br>  Verbo: Eu vejo<br>  Mans?o lunar: 17a.

Adora conquistar e atrai o sexo oposto com seu jeito natural e descontraído. Sente-se fatalmente atraído pelo dinamico e comunicativo geminiano, que é t?o versátil quanto ele e se identifica com a maneira de pensar do aquariano. O fogoso ariano e o sedutor leonino também s?o compatíveis por serem entusiasmados, mas como n?o suporta ficar limitado, fica difícil a convivência com o pacato taurino, com o metódico virginiano e com o caseiro canceriano.|`|fadeedb00ba5cfa1e35ae8d2def6f8acaa	Olá!!!<br>  Abaixo você terá o perfil do seu signo e a combina??o deles com todos os outros signos....<br>  <br>  PERFIL<br>  O mundo n?o seria t?o divertido se n?o existissem os sagitarianos. Donos de um senso de humor enorme, s?o capazes de fazer qualquer um se animar em qualquer situa??o. Vendo o lado alegre e belo da vida podem animar as pessoas contando suas aventuras, mesmo num velório, a n?o ser que seja de seu melhor amigo, e ele considera todos assim. Neste caso é capaz de chorar t?o alto e agarrar no caix?o com tanta for?a que todos pensar?o que o falecido era seu amigo de infancia e que convivia todos os dias com ele, mas conheceu há poucas semanas. Nenhuma figura mitológica representa t?o bem o Sagitário como o centauro, metade homem metade cavalo. De um lado um ser racional que filosofa sobre a vida e faz de tudo para que a lei seja obedecida, e de outro t?o abrutalhado que é capaz de comprar uma briga fazendo voar cadeiras para todos os lados. é... eles s?o meio escandalosos, exagerados e estabanados.   <br>   Extremamente francos, sempre prezam a verdade, mesmo que ela seja inadequada para o momento, o que os faz passar por inconvenientes em algumas situa??es. Sempre prontos a conhecer novas coisas na vida, eles esperam que todos tenham essa mesma disposi??o. Aventureiros e livres que s?o, é impossível segurá-los quando se decidem a viajar e conhecer outros mundos. Fome... como têm fome esses sagitarianos. Comem qualquer coisa, desde arroz, feij?o e ovo frito (claro que um prato enorme) até sopa de rinoceronte rosa da Iugoslávia, e eles adoram comidas exóticas, desde que sejam em quantidade, e melhor ainda se forem típicas de países distantes. Sagitarianos s?o eternos gozadores, mesmo quando est?o brigando. Assistir uma briga em que eles estejam participando é o mesmo que assistir uma comédia italiana, com sacadas geniais e um humor ferino terrível, antes de come?arem a voar pratos e cinzeiros. Depois disso s?o capazes de chamar o adversário, todo arrebentado, para tomar uma cerveja para esquecer as diferen?as, desde que sua opini?o tenha sido aceita. <br>  Eles se acham donos da verdade e discutem horas só para convencer as pessoas sobre um ponto de vista seu. Conhecem um pouco de tudo, o que os torna capazes de fazer qualquer bico, e em muitas vezes de forma “provisória-permanente”. Dinheiro.... como gastam dinheiro. Consumistas por natureza n?o conseguem conter seu impulso de comprar, qualquer coisa, uma de cada cor e de cada modelo. Mas eles têm sorte e sempre arranjam dinheiro, nem que for em jogo, que por sinal eles podem adorar. S?o ótimos esses seres de Sagitário. E n?o é pra menos : quem rege este signo é nada mais nada menos que Júpiter, o maior planeta do sistema solar, Zeus para os gregos, deus dos deuses, sendo t?o bons e violentos quanto ele. Ser amigo de um sagitariano é ser o melhor amigo dele, mesmo que você n?o queira. Crédulos e ingênuos, costumam se decepcionar com aquele seu melhor amigo que conheceu numa viagem no último final de semana e que pediu dinheiro emprestado e n?o devolveu. Mas tudo bem. Depois de reencontrá-lo e cobri-lo de porrada ele ainda vai chamá-lo para tomar uma cerveja e relembrar os velhos tempos, mesmo que estejam completando três semanas de amizade. <br>  <br>  <br>  SAGITáRIANOS E OUTROS SIGNOS<br>   SAGITáRIO X   áRIES<br>  A uni?o de dois signos de fogo com uma intensidade enorme, só poderá resultar em fogo de paix?o imenso. Uma rela??o com muita lealdade e extremo senso de coopera??o. Nas rela??es afetivas precisará de um certo tempo para estabilizar tanto fogo. Profissionalmente é uma ótima combina??o, só faltando um pouco de praticidade. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   TOURO<br>  A amizade tende a ser longa e duradoura. O animado sagitariano dá mais movimento à vida do calmo taurino. Quando se trata de rela??es afetivas, talvez o taurino n?o agüente a necessidade de aventura e liberdade do Sagitário. Com seu ciúme e possessividade tende a espantar o sagitariano em pouco tempo. Só se o taurino mudar e confiar mais. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   GêMEOS<br>  Como ambos têm o mesmo temperamento aventureiro e descomplicado, é uma rela??o que pode dar muito certo, em todos os sentidos. Desencanados por natureza, o relacionamento estará baseado na amizade e no companheirismo. No relacionamento afetivo pode ocorrer um certo distanciamento por parte do geminiano, mas os la?os de amizade superam tudo. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   C?NCER<br>  Toda rela??o é baseada em amor e compreens?o, e cada um deve ceder um pouco para conviver melhor com o outro. Apegado ao passado e muito romantico, o canceriano poderá sentir-se rejeitado pelo apaixonado sagitariano que com o passar do tempo n?o movimenta??o na rela??o. A amizade entre eles pode resultar numa melhor rela??o. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   LE?O<br>  Sendo os dois signos de fogo e apaixonados e romanticos, pode existir uma rela??o de amor e afinidade incríveis. Talvez o sagitariano n?o aceite t?o facilmente o autoritarismo natural do Le?o, t?o egocêntrico quanto o Sagitário. Moderando sua impulsividade o sagitariano pode conviver muito bem com o leonino, tanto afetiva como profissionalmente. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   VIRGEM<br>  O pacato e discreto virginiano pode se assustar um pouco com a extrovers?o e a alegria naturais do Sagitário. O conformismo e a humildade de Virgem costuma incomodar o t?o elétrico e desencanado Sagitário. Mesmo assim pode haver uma atra??o pela praticidade do Virgem, o que colabora para o Sagitário realizar seus sonhos e projetos. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   LIBRA<br>  Uma uni?o bastante saudável que pode durar muito tempo, podendo ser uma rela??o afetiva ou profissionalmente enriquecedora. Bastante sociáveis ter?o momentos de muita felicidade junto aos amigos que tanto prezam. Muito mais compreensivo, o libriano terá mais condi??es de se adaptar ao exagerado e extrovertido Sagitário. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   ESCORPI?O<br>  Muito intensos nos relacionamentos, a paix?o é inevitável. Após os contatos iniciais a paix?o se torna amor e companheirismo, mas o sagitariano pode se incomodar com o controle e o ciúme doentio que pode se manifestar no escorpiano frente à extrovers?o e facilidade com que o Sagitário estabelece contatos com as pessoas. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   SAGITáRIO<br>  Uma uni?o em que a amizade será o maior trunfo para tornar a rela??o mais duradoura. Um fogo de paix?o enorme pode existir no início da rela??o. Troca de opini?es sobre quest?es filosóficas e éticas podem produzir altos papos. Isso pode levar a constantes confrontos e minar a rela??o. Profissionalmente pode ocorrer maior afinidade, ajudando na parceria. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   CAPRICóRNIO<br>  O brincalh?o e extrovertido sagitariano n?o costuma receber bem a sisudez e a cautela do Capricórnio numa rela??o afetiva. Com o convívio pode ocorrer maior proximidade. Com sua tendência a cobrar responsabilidades, o capricorniano pode irritar e afastar o Sagitário. Profissionalmente é uma excelente combina??o, produtiva e criativa. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   AQUáRIO<br>  Uma rela??o bastante harmoniosa, o que pode resultar em um casal alegre e moderno, sendo divertido e descomplicado. Muito idealistas, est?o sempre abertos a novos rumos e novas formas de amar e entender o mundo. Sempre esperando bastante um do outro, pode existir uma expectativa muito grande que pode ocasionar decep??es com o tempo. <br>   SAGITáRIO X   PEIXES<br>  O pisciano responde bem aos sonhos e desejos de aventura do Sagitário. Tendo sua liberdade preservada e suas fantasias incentivadas o sagitariano sente bastante afeto pelo pisciano, que responde com amor e aten??o. Pode faltar senso de praticidade e muitos de seus sonhos caírem no vazio por falta de um embasamento maior.  <br>    <br>  Espero ter te ajudado, mas caso ainda ouver dúvidas entre nos sites abaixo:neles você n?o só encontra-rá os signos mais também runas,numerologia,sonhos,feng shui, búzios, horócopo chinês, quiromancia, tar?....nunca entre de cabe?a em apenas um site,  quando for ver seu signo entre em dois,trés para ver se dá certo mesmo....<br>  www.joaobidu.com.br<br>  www.aparecidaliberato.com.br<br>  www.uol.com.br<br>  www.terra.com.br<br>  www.somostodosum.com.br<br>  www.signoseastrologia.com.br<br>  www.google.com.br [pesquise signos]   <br>  <br>  ***bye***|`|2dcf5a559759285fdf316c748dccc6c7aa	Vai no www.gaiastral.com.br, q vc terá todas as tuas respostas desde comidas preferidas por esse signo até  como presentear um sagitariano .Boa sorte|`|b8e9dab4377a9190219c1b82d96d0638aa	N?o basta só utilizar a raz?o, temos que buscar atingir cada vez metas mais elevadas, através da sabedoria. Sagitário é esta transcendência, é elevar-se rumo à Verdade.Sabe por que as pessoas que nasceram entre este período se dizem "sagitarianas"? Porque durante esta época do ano, o Sol está passando pelo signo de Sagitário no céu. Quando você diz "sou sagitariano", está dizendo, com outras palavras, que tem o Sol no signo de Sagitário. Mas mesmo aqueles que n?o nasceram entre estes dias, têm Sagitário e todos os outros signos em seu mapa astrológico. Se você quer entender melhor como isto funciona, clique aqui. Se quer saber mais sobre Sagitário, escolha uma das op??es abaixo.<br>  <br>  O período que o sol passa por Sagitário acontece aproximadamente entre os dias 21 de novembro a 20 de dezembro, mas se você nasceu nos dias de transi??o entre os signos (ou de Escorpi?o para Sagitário ou de Sagitário para Capricórnio) é bom que calcule o seu mapa e verifique em que signo o Sol realmente está, ele pode ser diferente do que você sempre pensou.|`|e351201f71935b855d89cb6c4a8cd0eaaa	SAGITáRIO<br>  <br>  O centauro é uma criatura imaginária, metade cavalo e metade homem. Nas histórias mitológicas, é aventureiro e galopa até ao fim do mundo apenas pela alegria de encontrar algo novo. Nas m?os, segura o arco e a flecha. Aponta a seta a algum alvo distante, galopa em sua persegui??o e quando alcan?a o alvo dispara-a novamente, sempre em movimento. Os astrólogos acreditam que o centauro é um bom símbolo para as pessoas deste signo, porque geralmente adoram viajar, ver novos lugares e conhecer novas pessoas. Est?o sempre prontos para uma nova aventura e sempre dispostos a aprender algo de novo. <br>  As pessoas de Sagitário precisam de bastante liberdade, porque querem experimentar o mais possível da vida. Sentem-se infelizes se presos a uma rotina, e felizes quando se lan?am em algo de novo. Andar é um dos passatempos favoritos dos sagitarianos, e muitos s?o excelentes desportistas. Têm também uma mente inquieta e aventureira, e gostam de encetar novos estudos. Muitos Sagitários interessam-se por Filosofia e pelo mundo das ideias. Gostam de se divertir e s?o uma alegre companhia. <br>  Sagitário é um signo de fogo, como Carneiro e Le?o. Se você pertence ao signo de Sagitário, provavelmente irá descobrir que, com o passar dos anos, terá vontade de viajar. Tem uma mente activa e inquiridora, e irá sempre colocar quest?es sobre muitas coisas. Acima de tudo, tem uma grande confian?a em si próprio, e o seu dom único e especial é a capacidade de confiar numa estrela protectora e acreditar que os seus sonhos se tornar?o realidade.|`|e5c5f245905b89846f161eb12410da27aa	Suas experiências passadas s?o agora como um grande para-raios, protegendo você o tempo todo de todos os imprevistos que surgirem. <br>  <br>  AMOR<br>  Momento de expans?o no seu relacionamento amoroso.

Seu símbolo é o centauro. Forma com áries e Le?o a triplicidade dos signos do Fogo. é também um dos quatro signos mutáveis, juntamente com Gêmeos, Virgem e Peixes. Com pequenas varia??es nas datas dependendo do ano, os sagitarianos s?o as pessoas nascidas entre 22 de novembro e 21 de dezembro.<br>  é ilustrada com a figura do arqueiro. Quíron, que era um centauro (metade homem, metade cavalo). Seu arco está apontado para o corpo do Escorpi?o, como uma vingan?a pela morte de órion.<br>  Os sagitarianos concentram sua aten??o no alvo que desejam atingir. Só n?o devem afobar-se na hora de ver as metas alcan?adas. S?o amantes dos esportes e das viagens. Os sagitarianos se interessam pela aquisi??o do conhecimento da mesma forma como cuidam da sua liberdade. Sendo um signo de fogo, e mutável, essa capacidade de desprendimento e mobilidade é experimentada ao máximo, fazendo do sagitariano ao mesmo tempo um companheiro, um mentor, um sábio, ou, pelo menos, isso é tudo o que ele gostaria de ser. Quer sempre o que está além, gosta de romper barreiras e ultrapassar limites e carrega uma auto-estima que o leva a um otimismo inabalável e por vezes demasiado infantil. Entretanto, n?o é dado a desistências. Mesmo que, depois de atingido o objetivo, ele se sinta entendiado e atraído por algum outro assunto.

31abc6887170a60e97857497f538c28faa	T? mandando td q sei...Como naum coube td aki coloquei as combina??es em fontes ok?<br>  Sagitário tem como símbolo a imagem do centauro Quiron,filho da oceanica Filira que Saturno conseguiu seduzir transformando-se num belo cavalo branco.Tal como Europa, Filira montou no animal que a raptou,levando-a para o monte Pelion.Desse amor nasceu Quiron,que foi amado pelos deuses e que,a despeito da sua metade animal,adquiriu tal ciência e sabedoria que a todos espantava.Heróis como Ulisses,Jas?o, Castor e Polux,Teseu,Esculápio e Aquiles,sentaram-se aos seus pés, para ouvi-lo e aprender.é por isso que Sagitário é o signo da cultura e do saber.Os sagitarianos gostam de aprender e ensinar.S?o inteligentes,leais e intuitivos.às vezes s?o gulosos e sensuais, sempre ávidos de amor e prazer. A flecha do centauro, apontado para o céu, n?o permite que eles se esque?am da sua origem divina.<br>  Sagitário foge da rotina,porque almeja o mundo livre do espírito e com isso vai passando pela vida,colecionando grandes amores, sem contudo se fixar em nenhum.às vezes pode acontecer, caso existam fatores astrológicos na carta mais estabilizantes, mas é raro.Paix?es estremecedoras,grande vontade de viver sonhos,forte sensualidade,e uma fidelidade antes de tudo filosófica,mais do que sexual.<br>  <br>  S?o pessoas ativas e combativas com muita for?a vital.Pode conhecer parceiros de outros países ou mesmo em uma viagem ter alguns envolvimentos afetivos com estrangeiros.Caso n?o viaje para fora do país poderá conhecer parceiros de outros estados e cidades.O excesso de sinceridade pode fazer com que percam alguns parceiros no decorrer de sua vida afetiva. Isto geralmente ocorre quando se relacionam com pessoas do elemento água(cancer,escorpi?o ou peixes),que s?o muito emotivos.<br>  <br>  O ato sexual<br>  No ato sexual s?o selvagens.A liga??o com a natureza e com a figura de um cavalo,que é o símbolo do Centauro,meio cavalo meio homem gera uma postura animal em que o suor e o calor do momento do prazer,dosado com movimentos quase bruscos. Neste palco do amor n?o deve faltar espa?o para poderem galopar nas redomas esfuziantes de sua libido.O parceiro deve ter muito f?lego para suportar seu ímpeto.é comum camas, cadeiras,copos e objetos serem alvos do seu jeito espa?oso de se expressar entre quatro paredes.<br>  Sagitário,o nono signo do zodíaco inicia-se,no hemisfério norte, no fim do outono, quando o trabalho do campo já se encerrou em fun??o da proximidade do inverno,e as pessoas passavam a depender mais da ca?a.<br>  <br>  é o signo das viagens e das explora??es.Como um n?made que vai aonde encontra alimento,o sagitariano é independente.O signo corresponde também à busca do conhecimento mais profundo,sobre os outros e sobre o mundo.A expans?o de suas habilidades,especialmente mentais, fundamenta-se na aspira??o de transcender sua própria condi??o humana.Benevolência e generosidade s?o marcas características de Sagitário.Elas s?o personalidades bonachonas.Adoram festas e costumam ser ótimos convivas.Gostam de contar piadas,bem como de discutir quest?es filosóficas.Têm, de fato, uma cabedal de assuntos dos mais variados,pois pensar e refletir sobre o universo é uma das coisas que mais tendem a fazer.<br>  Em rela??es amorosas gostam de independência.Sua natureza exploratória pode levá-los a serem infiéis.|`|3b78a2fb1d5e69f27d1fe6d1bcb17846aa	Isinha...

"vejo o que muitos nem percebem...." - "vivencio o que poucos vivenciaram....." - "sinto o que muitos sentem...." - "a verdade por mais honrável e respeitável que seja, jamais será a verdade enquanto n?o se vivenciar os fatos."

Segure a onda para n?o criar divergências...<br>  <br>  <br>  Você adora estar de bem com a vida e com o mundo. Seu otimismo e sua sinceridade s?o marcas registradas. Além disso, faz de tudo para superar obstáculos, pois n?o consegue encarar o baixo-astral, especialmente nos assuntos pessoais. No amor, sua franqueza desperta a simpatia de quem está ao seu lado. Você sabe fazer festa para conquistar quem deseja e, quando vê o menor sinal de interesse da pessoa, vai logo espalhando a alegria para chamar a aten??o. Pintou interesse, seu cora??o bate acelerado e você n?o tem medo de encarar.

Qualquer um pode ganhar um emblema de Usuário Top e isso N?O depende de pontos ou nível.<br>  <br>  Usuários Top N?O s?o permanentes , o que quer dizer que vosê deve continuar ser um respondedor ativo para manter o emblema de Usuário Top. Similarmente, se você n?o é um Usuário Top hoje, você pode ganhar o emblema contribuindo com respostas de alta qualidade em uma categoria qualquer ou múltiplas categorias de sua escolha.<br>  <br>  Quanto mais ativamente você contribui com respostas da qualidade e melhores respostas para uma categoria particular, mais facilmente você ganhará o emblema por suas contribui??es naquela categoria. Justo como usuários ou líderes caracterizados da categoria,o emblema é outro meio de honrar e caracterizar os membros de comunidade que est?o ativamente participando e conhecedores em categorias particulares do YR.<br>  <br>  Esta é nossa primeira vers?o do emblema de Usuário Top, e nós sabemos que n?o é perfeito, ainda. Nós continuaremos melhorando a lógica e heurística usada para escolher os Usuários Top para assegurar que as pessoas que os recebem s?o as mais merecedoras.<br>  Nós temos "ouvido"seu retorno e nós entendemos que existe interesse sobre o abuso deste emblema, e nós iremos mudar as regras para Usuário <br>  <br>  Top t?o necessário seja para combater pessoas jogando e abusos.<br>  ***<br>  P: Eu estou no nível 1-4, por que sou considerado um Usuário Top?<br>  <br>  R: Como mencionado antes, o nível ou total de pontos no YR na verdade n?o é fator para o status de Usuário Top. Se você está no nível 1-4 e foi selecionado como Usuário Top, é porque você tem ativamente fornecido conteúdo de qualidade em determinada categoria.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  P: Eu estou no nível 4+, por que n?o sou um Usuário Top?<br>  <br>  R: Novamente, o nível de um usuário n?o é fator determinante para a considera??o de Usuário Top. Usuário Top variam dependendo de seus hábitos na participa??o semanal em cada categoria, ent?o você pode descobrir-se ostentando um emblema alaranjado no futuro próximo<br>  <br>  ***<br>  P: E se eu n?o quiser o emblema de Usuário Top?<br>  <br>  R: Nós vemos este emblema como honra e queremos reconhecer o tempo e o esfor?o que os Usuários Top puseram respondendo perguntas em uma categoria particular. Nós esperamos que os Usuários Top estejam <br>  orgulhosos de seu emblema. Entretanto, nós "ouvimos" interesses de você que o emblema poderia inclinar a avalia??o desfavoravelmente e a sele??o da melhor resposta ir de encontro aos Usuários Top. Nós estamos <br>  investigando este item adicional e se tal polariza??o ocorrer, nós fornecer-lhe-emos uma op??o para esconder o emblema.<br>  ***<br>  P:Alguns Usuários Top têm contribuido com perguntas e respostas de baixa qualidade no YR. Por que ainda s?o considerados Usuários Top?<br>  <br>  R: Há um ligeiro atraso no processo do cálculo e atualiza??o dos Usuários Top no YR, assim há uma possibilidade que você possa ver isto ocorrer de tempo em tempo. Entretanto, se as perguntas e respostas do Usuário Top se tornar menos do que favorável, eles n?o ser?o Usuários <br>  Top por muito tempo, porque na atualiza??o (update) seguinte os fará estar fora da corrida.<br>  __________________<br>  <br>  Fontes:<br>  Vampira pela tradu??o do blog americano<br>  Une accolade|`|fb5885eb7dbffaa39cdb6e78d172d489aa	n?o sei mesmo

O POP vende a imagem do cantor junto com a musica e a midia explora essa imagem ao máximo, refletindo a sociedade capitalista...<br>  <br>  Mas falar de qualidade musical, é algo complicado, pois envolve ética, valores morais, e pensamentos unicos de cada indivíduo, por exemplo, oque eu acho incrível, e para você é um lixo, mesmo sendo tecnicamente bem feitos é algo complicado de se discutir...<br>  <br>  Enfim as musicas v?o mudando de acordo com a nossa sociedade, e com a globaliza??o, temos mais op??es para ouvir...<br>  <br>  Bem, cada um deve respeitar a opini?o do próximo, pois tudo nessa vida, varia de acordo com o ponto de vista...<br>  <br>  <br>  PAZ e AMOR e um FELIZ NATAL !|`|33eecd7203d93245112d8577de2ba59eaa	As  musicas v?o seguindo a juventude de hoje em dia, assim como músicas que fizeram a nossa cabe?a na nossa época e nossos pais odiavam , isso faz parte... hoje a gente odiar dessas musicas que est?o surgindo.|`|7dd75537559eb446c58f01ec4710562daa	Bom dia...

E um certo dia,<br>  enquanto tirava agua do joelho, apareceu a seu lado um rasta jamaicano<br>  muito<br>  grande e forte. O japa repara que no penis do jamaicano tambem se lia<br>  WY.<br>  Entao,<br>  ele decide perguntar:<br>  - Nossa! Que coincidencia! A tua noiva tambem se chama Wendy?<br>  - Nao. Porque? - respondeu o jamaicano.<br>  - Porque o meu penis tambem diz WY, e quando esta no seu apogeu, diz<br>  WENDY...<br>  -No, brother.

Sai de nariz empinado pois estava muito feliz, n?o se considerava mais cara de cu. De repente em sua caminhada ele vê um bueiro de esgoto que estava aberto e foi olhar pra ver se tinha alguem trabalhando. Joaozinho olha pra baixo e vê um operário.

Após a morte do rei Petrus II, o trono do reino de Avilan é assumido pela rainha Valentine, uma histérica que n?o estava preparada para o governo. No entanto, em seu testamento, o falecido rei revela haver deixado um filho bastardo, que teve com a prostituta Maria Fromet, e seria o herdeiro do trono.<br>  <br>  A rainha Valentine é dominada pelos conselheiros reais: Crespy Aubriet, Gaston Marny, Bidet Lambret, Gerárd Laugier e Vanolli Berval, que com seu jogo de cintura comandam completamente a rainha. O único conselheiro honesto de Avilan é Bergeron Bouchet, que sofre com o assédio de Valentine. Ele é casado com a bela Madeleine, a única mulher do reino que sabe escrever, e tem ideais feministas. Madeleine é objeto do desejo de Ravengar, o bruxo da corte.<br>  <br>  Na ausência do sucessor do trono, os conselheiros reais coroam o mendigo Pichot rei, como se fosse o verdadeiro filho de Petrus II. A arma??o é obra do misterioso Ravengar, o feiticeiro. Porém, há uma conspira??o entre a classe pobre de Avilan, que busca derrubar o governo para instituir uma sociedade menos opressiva, já que o reino é corroído pela corrup??o de seus governantes e injusti?as sociais. Dentre eles está Loulou Lion, a dona de uma taberna que sabe a verdade sobre o filho do rei; e Corcoran, o bobo da corte que é um rebelde infiltrado no palácio.<br>  <br>  Mas o líder da revolu??o é Jean Piérre, que, ao descobrir que é o filho bastardo do rei, passa a lutar pela coroa que lhe pertence. Todavia, n?o só de heroísmo sobrevive Jean Piérre. Sua luta é entremeada por duas mulheres apaixonadas: a jovem Aline, e Suzanne, a bela esposa do conselheiro Vanolli Berval, que disputam o seu amor.<br>  <br>  Quem me dera que eles repetissem a novela de novo!|`|f7j2IuHpaa	Sem sombra de dúvidas é A viagem.|`|jSg2LoGeaa	o Beijo do Vampiro|`|DOvG3d6vaa	REI DO GADO.|`|3ef51330186f522835d3d64d62a553d6aa	A Escrava Isaura da Record.|`|2df9b766c39bdd1e58de398ab97a623eaa	A viagem.|`|966c4cf25a32ec67c4da07edeb5d53c6aa	ESCRAVA ISAURA - as duas vers?es.... memoráveis<br>  <br>  PROVA DE AMOR - rede record muito boa<br>  <br>  A VIAGEM - n?o sou muito f? da novela mas lembro-me que ela que deu maior ibope da história da novela das sete, e foi a única novela que passou DUAS VEZES na vale a pena ver de novo|`|IhZWdtwFaa	Eu adorei Tieta.

d0oGeasiaa	The pictures speak for themselves. If your relationship was to the point you were discussing marriage then he should not be acting this way. Now if he had some serious crisis that may have affected his moods then I would understand. Buth the pictures at the party clearly show he is not depressed or under any stress. He is acting distant in the hopes that you will break up with him. That way the relationship ends and has no guilt. You need to confront him now and demand to know what is going on.|`|19de408a005d3d579cfc40709958ee1faa	Yikes.  I would definitely be upset.  I would talk to him and ask him to just come clean.  From the pics, he was getting WAY too close to someone who is not his girlfriend.  Bring up the party and see what he says.  If he doesn't admit to anything, then bring up the pics.  Sorry honey, my heart would hurt too.|`|DK5LOEbBaa	He's with someone else, gee|`|gjI72veJaa	no its not psycho at all! i mean i would get mad to if i found out he was holding hands with another girl!!! i woulda let him explain to you what the heck thats deal with the pictures was.. if hes still yur man then he should make an effort to see you or talk to you cus what is the point of going out with him?|`|zliekXKRaa	Dump his two-timing a$$!|`|u7v5HBMqaa	I think you need to go to another section for this question.|`|AA10690363	confront him, and talk it out. sounds fishy to me though...|`|194d6cb9c3f4ad7e958b820d6fc5b23aaa	..too long...<br>  ..question .should be in "relationships"..|`|Us6FBBQYaa	A picture is worth 1,000 words....what does this one say to you?<br>  You should dump him and move on with your life! <br>  There are plenty of fish in the sea and many men that would be willing to make you the center of attention. If he only called me once a week and I got pics of him at a party with some girl, there would be no talk of marriage, as I would have kicked him to the curb already! <br>  P.S. just my personal opinion, but 14 months is not a long enough time dating someone to be talking about marriage.|`|a637d0b672c011b905c0c865bc2ea40eaa	It's my experience that when anybody tells you that they don't have time to call, they are full of crap. That's one of the oldest and most lame excuses every thought up. Yes you should ask him about the photo's, and I think you should re-think this whole marriage idea. You have not known him that long. And how old are the two of you?|`|yTKQlWGsaa	Well, I don't know what to say! But do you seriously talk about marriage? Give him an ultimatum!

Case suffered no vocal damage. The bullet, that went in through his throat, came out the back of his neck and was miraculously less than a centimeter away from paralyzing and killing him. To the shock of everyone around, Case was out of the hospital in four hours with just bandages around his neck.

yuqZ6M96aa	it seems quite common for people without wide musical exposure to have the typical favorite band list; metallica, beatles, nirvana, ac/dc etc, and also for them to just reject anything theyve not heard of, because if its not on mtv/clear channel radio/movie trailers etc its not pop culture and no good<br>  <br>  thats fine, i just dont understand not being able to give something a chance, i give everything a chance and even if it doesnt move me somehow i can determine if theres good instrumentation/composition and whatnot and if i know someone that will like it i show it to them<br>  <br>  when i was very young the first music i got into was the beatles and other oldies along with nirvana and the rest of the pop-alternative late 80s early 90s, i was just never content with one band and fascinated by what was being done by everyone else and so i expanded as i grew<br>  <br>  i could rip pop bands to shred but theres no reason to, so i dont see the reason to rip on a band like the jonbenet, who i actually like, their album 'the plot thickens' is good stuff<br>  <br>  its one thing to not identify with a song/band, i totally understand and respect that but to know that you gotta give a listen with an open mind|`|vidiDXxBaa	I love thrash, death and black metal.

AA10699766	dude don't worry about what other drummers will say.  That's the thing about being in a band.  you gotta be your own person, your own identity, show no fear.  If you're worried about that stuff, people will look down on you.  If you don't care what they think, it'll show and they'll respect you for that.  I'm sure you could look up old famous rock stars and the unkosher things they did/had to help them.

OK ?|`|564096c9f804df43f3dff1b05f6e8165aa	Most cybals, ziljin,etc are laminatid brass and other materials...you could possibly have a sheetmetal shop either heliarc or braze them....it will change the tone and timber but, at the cost of symbals nowadays, it might be the best alternative.....|`|36a97639990c4f48151e55b2f783dd4aaa	it would be an exercise in futility.  Yes they would sound like crap and they wouldn't hold together very long.  If they are cracking that easily, you are either buying really cheap cymbals, or using rebar for sticks.|`|AA12257987	I've known guys who have welded cymbals back together, because it is fairly commen for them to crack, especially if you have a heavy hand.  It can be a temporary fix, but of course i feel it does affect the sound.|`|O2n3UFh7aa	They would definitely sound like crap.  You might be able to find someone to weld them for you - since you would need to have a little arc welder or something in order to do it (plus you would have to know how to do it).<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to get some decent quality cymbals.  Zildjian makes the best.  I've got a set that a friend of mine let me borrow that he, I, and several other people have been beating on severely for years, and they don't have a single crack.  Cheap cymbals will break (and sound crappy to begin with).  You might try using lighter gauge sticks (your drum heads will thank you too).|`|db9ea6bd9adac8023cdb677b8ad251deaa	i had the same problem, and i tried welding, but they just came out a mess and it screwed up the sound...i just got new ones, and they were damn expensive, but it was worth it...i kept having to buy new ones, and dear god it was a nuisance.
594c579c7b63fa806317bee480d1b2ebaa	It's not really cool, but I think that the lyrics speak out what most of us are feeling. Especially the line, "it's not that we don't care... we just know that the fight ain't fair." It's not exactly giving up, but there's also a saying that sometimes the best solution is time. So we're just biding our time 'til the day "our generation is gonna rule the population."|`|241b5d4a64e81e9d8b5fd82f348a0c29aa	Even though I am a die-hard John Mayer fan, my first thoughts of Waiting on the world to change were kinda like yours. It sounded a bit to cliche for my taste, and for the most part John Mayer + Cliche is not even an equation. But once i really began to go into the lyrics and their meaning it hit me. He's trying to make a point that our generation of kids are not willing to rise up to the ocassion at hand. They know what's wrong and have an opinion on important issues, but how often do they act based on what we stand for? We're just waiting for someone else to do it when in reality, the only person who is responsible is them.<br>  Maybe he meant to put a song with meaning in a catchy tune that will eventually hit mainstream...hey w/e sells, right? ;-)|`|AA11498709	?|`|AA11754314	Not exactly sure what those other songs, besides Mayer's lastest song, have to do with war/government/foreign policy. I honestly don't care for any of those songs but I am familiar with them. It seems that with "Waiting on the world..", Mayer isn't being lazy or weak. I think he's just being a realist. Let's face it, one individual can't change the world no matter how hard he or she tries. Especially with everything that is happening in our current news. It seems that all we can really do is wait for everything to change in Iraq and all of the world. Sure we can get out and vote, donate to foreign charities, join a protest march, speak out. But we can only do our part. We can't change the world's minds and make them join our efforts.|`|b4a2ae90298c0b35884c9c9d04f1643faa	I don't understand your long winded question.

It now came down to their final test. They had to resist the temptation of sexual arousal. The head monk led them into a room made them strip and tied bells to their cocks. he informed them that if they were aroused the bell will ring and they cannot become monks.

Nesta fase mudam o perfil de amizades com rela??o a suas amigas: <br>  <br>  As que s?o bonitas:<br>  Procuram ser muito amigas das mulheres que s?o piores do que ela.<br>  As que s?o feias:<br>  Procuram ser muito amigas de mulheres bonitas para ficarem com as sobras.<br>  As que s?o louras:<br>  Tanto faz, afinal elas s?o minorias e s?o as preferida pelos homens.<br>  As Inteligentes:<br>  Andam com as loiras, para se destacarem intelectualmente. <br>  <br>  25 aos 30 anos:<br>  Nesta fase formam 5 grupos distintos: <br>  <br>  G1 : As que casaram por dinheiro;<br>  G2 : As que casaram por amor;<br>  G3 : As que n?o casaram;<br>  G4 : As que simplesmente casaram;<br>  G5 : As inteligentes. <br>  <br>  Porém todas n?o se conseguem satisfazerem plenamente, pois as do: <br>  <br>  G1 : descobrem que dinheiro n?o é tudo na vida, e sentem falta de uma paix?o;<br>  G2 : descobrem que a paix?o n?o é tudo na vida, e sentem falta do dinheiro;<br>  G3 : N?o interessa o dinheiro e a paix?o, sentem mesmo falta é de um homem;<br>  G4 : N?o entendem por que se casaram;<br>  G5 : Descobrem que ser inteligente n?o é tudo na vida. <br>  <br>  N?o importa o grupo a que pertencem, a desilus?o é evidente e ent?o come?am a apresentar os primeiros sintomas de uma doen?a muito cr?nica denominada: RDT (Reclamam De Tudo), na qual os homens acabam por ser as maiores vitima dessa paranóia. <br>  <br>  30 aos 35 anos:<br>  Sabem exatamente onde erraram, ficam sem saída, e num ato de desespero pintam o cabelo de loiro e tentam ser mais burras que o normal. <br>  <br>  V?o para a aeróbica, tentam voltar a ser a menininha, porém o esfor?o n?o dá resultado.<br>  Cai a auto-estima,o peito,orabo,a barriga…Agrava-se ainda mais o sintoma RDT(Reclamam De Tudo). <br>  <br>  35 aos 40 anos:<br>  Pioram a sua situa??o.

Procuram ajuda espiritual. <br>  <br>  40 aos 45 anos:<br>  N?o suportam mais as loiras naturais, principalmente as que se deram bem na vida.<br>  Tudo desmorona à sua volta. Agrava-se ainda mais o sintoma RDT e agora est?o convictas<br>  de que o seu parceiro foi realmente o culpado por tudo o que de mau aconteceu com elas,<br>  desprezando totalmente os bons momentos que tiveram na vida.<br>  Abandonam a ajuda espiritual e procuram ajuda médica, com analistas e cirurgi?es plásticos. <br>  <br>  45 aos 50 anos:<br>  Chega a nova fase da sua vida, parece que tudo vai ficar bem, gra?as aos cirurgi?es.<br>  O rabo e a barriga voltaram ao normal, o peito ficou melhor do que era e explode uma<br>  paix?o pelo analista. Acha que ele é a única pessoa que conheceu durante toda sua vida que<br>  a entende, e tem paciência quando conversa com ela.<br>  Porém esquece que o analista conversa com ela somente 1 hora por semana e cobra 100 reais,<br>  enquanto o seu parceiro atura as lamenta??es,o mínimo 40 horas por semana e ainda tem um gasto de aproximadamente 1000 reais por mês.<br>  <br>  Após os 50 anos:<br>  Come?am a ter comportamento diferentes e bem definidos porém continuam com<br>  o RDT até o fim dos seus dias… <br>  <br>  um abra?o!
DYijN8Hmaa	Na verdade, a Globo tem procurado ser uma emissora cada vez mais mercadológica, ou seja vender de tudo para todos.

Oh and yes if you watch the TV-Show "Heroes" you might recognize the guy from it, Milo Ventimiglia (the one who gets his powers from being around other people with super powers) playing Rocky′s son. I think he′s really suiting to the part, and im not sure what to expect of  course, cuz i havent seen it yet, but i have a feeling that it′ll probably be pretty good.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion though.

The great thing about the film is that it completely ties in with the way the other Rocky films where made. It's like they made it a month after Rocky 5, but it is updated a little with some fantastic cinematography towards the end- brilliant.<br>  Oh the plot is basically a simulated fight is aired on TV, between Rocky and the current (I think)Heavyweight champion, who is young and able, the results say Rocky wins, of course this causes problems in the Boxing world for the other boxer and in the end Rocky is asked to fight to prove that he couldn't win!

He also believes it's a better live vocal mic than the SM-58.<br>  <br>       As far as the omni-directional and uni-directional argument..it can be said that because the SM-57 is uni-directional, meaning it picks up vocals from directly in front, instead of from all sides, as the SM-58, that the 57 can produce higher gain in live settings before feedback.|`|ioz2HtwUaa	Shure SM-58 is the sound industry standard. There are a few mics in the $100 price range that may sound a little better or brighter or whatever but none are more durable. If it ever does break (not likely) send it to Shure and they'll send you a new one for $50. If you go with the SM-57 as a vocal mic consider a foam windscreen for it.|`|VzUawN7naa	I'm not sure if you're looking for a mic for live or for recording purposes, but if you're using it for recording, I'd say get this MXL package that has an additional instrument mic too (good value here):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pro-audio.musiciansfriend.com/product/MXL-MXL-990MXL-991-Recording-Microphone-Package?sku=273166" rel="nofollow">http://pro-audio.musiciansfriend.com/pro...</a><br>  <br>  For live, I'd go with this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pro-audio.musiciansfriend.com/product/Sennheiser-E835-Performance-Vocal-Mic?sku=270825" rel="nofollow">http://pro-audio.musiciansfriend.com/pro...</a><br>  <br>  Either way, should work for ya.|`|c7OOmkLXaa	I would say get married but then there goes the hundred bucks and then some. But on the other hand you would get your vocal microphone with no switch to turn it off.|`|FUwnW9Mtaa	You can't go wrong with a Shure or a Blue Eyeball.|`|8tRYrQzpaa	Definitely go for the Shure SM 58.  It will cost you about $100.  The 58 is omnidirectional meaning you can sing into the mic from any angle, very useful when the mic is on a stand.  The SM 57 is comparable, but being uni-directional, you have to sing directly into it.  I have been using an SM 58 in live gigs for years.  Very durable and excellent vocal reproduction.  Looks good in your hand, too!<br>  This is what MusiciansFriend.com has to say about the SM 58:<br>      Shure SM58 Mic Features:<br>      * The world standard for stage vocals<br>      * Distinctive upper-midrange presence<br>      * Perfectly balanced and comfortable in the hand<br>      * Smooth, vocal-tailored frequency response: 50Hz to 15kHz<br>  The site has over 400 user reviews, too.

Airedales and ALL terriers can be agressive... it's their nature, they are HUNTERS of stuff! AND, since they are working dogs or hunters or W/E, they need daily exercise.  Ya know what really bothers me?.. people wanna get a dog to 'compliment' themselves, sometimes, NOT SAYIN YOU! criky it's gettin hot in here again,, coff coff.. BUT, consider ALL the dogs needs, and buy one from a REPUTABLE BREEDER.. reputable being the operative word here! no backyard types, go balls out and spend a LOT of money!

Hn5mGBWuaa	With any guitar nowadays, you can tweak it to accommodate your musical style. For best guitars on the market, they tend to be Fenders and Gibsons. However, the most important piece is your pickups or humbucker and your amp. Strings also play a part in the sound. If you like stripped down guitars with nothing but the bare essentials, you can't go wrong with a stratocaster or telecaster. Gibsons, while more expensive, provide more adjustment to your sound and overall longevity to your instrument. In the end, what you buy is what fits your playing style. <br>  <br>  Ebay and musiciansfriend have the best deals.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You might want to add Rickenbacker basses to the list.|`|kyEKb3cwaa	Man you should try the Ibanez GSR200.

The second house is considered for speech and Saturn is placed in second house from Langa. Saturn, also known as Manda (meaning slow) is delaying the process.  But Jupiter is having full aspect to the Langa.  Jupiter is also having full aspect to Moon and Sun. Hence, the boy will have only a delay in beginning speech.  Pray Lord Vishnu and Lord Ayyappa (Saneeswara).|`|PGeAFKYZaa	The given data indicates birth place in Toronto metropolitan area with Karaoke Laguna, Mai sh Rash and at present Vimsotari Dasha of Sukra. The speech area Lord is seen with Pooran drishti of Guru which has GajKesari Yogam and will be protective in several ways and during adversity. though the Sukra is in Rogaish and Shani has 10th drishti on the Lord of speech yet the beneficial yogam of Guru is very helpful and the child should grow out of speech problems. Being kind to the child, child's mother and your own parents, visiting Gurudwara regularly and reciting Sukhmani Sahib as a group in the family including to the child with parsad of Misharee and to child misharee dissolved in water will be very helpful from the astrological point of view. Speak very slowly, sweetly and carefully with the child all the time. Also it is always good to consult and follow up with your doctor. If provided with good habits, education and spiritual education there are great chances of attaining a position of honour and plenty.

CwrayzxBaa	You are correct.<br>  <br>  Dr Who is has scheduled 4 special episodes (movies) for this year.  The regular full run of episodes will return next year with a new Doctor and a new head writer (Peter Moffat of Blink fame).   All is not lost though.   The episodes we do see this year are pretty much guarranteed to be block buster stories.  Don't forget they have to give David Tennant's doctor a huge send off before then.    I think the stories we do get will be something very special.<br>  <br>  For those living in Australia (like me), ABC1 is currently rerunning David Tennants entire era starting with his first episode on the series playing the doctor.  This is also a good time to catch up on the original classic series if you haven't done so by now.    Many of the stories are now out on DVD.  Some are well worth watching since the new series picked up right off where the last one finished. We might have to wait a year for our fix of Dr Who but that doesn't mean we don't have to see him at all.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	ive been wondering the same thing. i saw some posts from british people saying that there is a new doctor and that they dont like him . i havent seen any ads. just went to the sci fi channel dr who forum and they said the first full season does start in 2010. they also said that there are some movies that may or may not air. bbc shows it too but i havent seen any new ones|`|b0AvMRqbaa	I'm sure the new actor playing Dr Who next year will be great. The whole concept of Dr Who is that he regenerates and changes his appearance. Not just his looks, his voice and mannerisms too. <br>  <br>  Everyone will have their own favourite Dr Who but will warm to the new Doctors who come along and enjoy the stories.|`|2kpr2arRaa	yes there will only Specials for 2009 and the new dr starts in 2010<br>  <br>  the Specials only for 2009 was annouced a year ago- they are filming the special right now.<br>  <br>  there have been tons of interviews and articles about this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.david-tennant.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.david-tennant.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gallifreyone.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/</a>

Any song or solo that has fast parts in it, I recommend buying a metronome... preferrably digital.  These help sooooo much, because you can start keeping time with the metronome at a slower speed... and once you get used to it, or get better in slower speeds you can increase by 1 and practice until you keep increasing the speed to the rate of the song... or even faster!... Practice w/ the metronome with a speed that your hand won't get too tired of playing the entire song.  Increase speed everytime you finish going through the song 1 time ( or you can just practice the "troubling riffs")... then increase the speed by one (this won't seem like its any faster, but you'll like the results!
AA11927461	Yes, the movie is based on Lauren Weisbergers life when she was an intern.  I think, however, it is just coincidence that an Andrea Sachs is a journalist for TIME.

AA10363719	No. He just took away life from another person just to save something that isn't a human yet. I've done extensive research on this for an ethics class that I took, and a lot of those embryos that don't get adopted, get thrown away in the garbage because there's only a certain length of time that you can keep them frozen like that. Yes I understand that some consider this embryo a person already, but not everyone does. He should stop pushing his morality down everybody else's throat. Stem cell research can save a lot of lives and cure diseases that there is no cure for right now. What about Michael J. Fox and r.i.p Christopher Reeve, don't they count too? And the millions of people like them??? Don't they deserve to live a happy life also?|`|AA11148177	No, he's dead wrong...as dead as Ronald Regan.|`|AA11591557	Nope, he's wrong to veto it.|`|11d70d4b12abc40a7c25e217544293c2aa	no he is wrong with stems more lives can be helped like micheal j fox|`|AA11149362	why is this in the tv section?|`|AA11521837	No Mr. Bush is so wrong to veto this.  It is so important to this country and the world to do stem cell research.  THe man is a fool. Can't wait until he is gone....|`|c5aaaa7bc0de5169e89cff41344a3c80aa	No.  He stated they were babies - they're cells, you bleeping idiot!!  The stupid fool is condemning God-only-knows-how-many people to lives of misery and hell because research can't be done on finding a cure when its been scientifically proven that the best hope lies with stem cell research.  But, they're babies - what a moron!!!!|`|4a4debc2295ea42fdf355eb1702d5ba1aa	Absolutely not.  90 percent of the embryos under consideration would be destroyed in any event.  It could very well save millions of lives if we let stem cell research begin.  It's quite ironic, that to appease the religious right, who see this as a "right to life" issue, they're willing to sacrifice millions of lives just for the bible thumping photo-op.  Shame on Bush!|`|8199ededa2641eea617a7e46da0f08e9aa	" why is this in the tv section? "<br>  <br>  Because it was just on the TV News!!! Turn your TV on!<br>  <br>  Doh!<br>  <br>  No, Bush is way uninformed on this issue. He's running hard  for the popularity race.|`|ef66534e9519d073454aeb57441d01e0aa	Yes, it was the right decision.|`|f6f010316667a2ee853cac06d676f4f7aa	No way, he is just playing to try to recoup the radical right
AA11039337	it's been broken 7 times, and he said he doesn't want to get it fixed because its part of who he is, and "chicks dig him cause hes funny and clever. he's good looking in a goofy way , and besides sometimes it not just about looks and the physical part of someone its the personality and boy does he have one|`|22ed0d48c6c1115ff731b2bbcc471625aa	same doctor as michael jackson,|`|AA10001315	broken nose - never got it straightened out<br>  <br>  so why is he so dang cute? and he is cute - not handsome, not hunky... he's like the good opposite of the "bad boy" (the bad opposite would be nerdy).  It's all about how he carries myself - his confidence, his self assuredness and his comic talent.  How many girls love a guy who "makes me laugh". The guy is always positive and always trying to "get the girl" - endearing qualities.|`|b5be436a63ad40aa323ac3d3326ef01eaa	i dont know but to me it looks like he had a one night stand and the girl found him and socked him in the nose and broke it and now its looks like that =)|`|c3d2a5631de10427998246762425a028aa	That really is a good question.  As a chick I have no idea what my species sees in him.  He's not good looking and I don't find him particularly funny.  I am an Adam Sandler kinda girl when it comes to funny men.|`|e5c3d4db216f57cbf15243fdf7bdcf39aa	he shoved his nose up a walnut's ***. because they are stupid|`|fa3ba77ba845dd38473cb5287435e458aa	It was broken a while ago.  Chicks probably still dig him because he's funny and he has millions of dollars.|`|AA11521837	I would have to assume he broke it.  It does not look like his brothers at all.  I am not a big Owen Wilson fan.  As a matter of fact, I don't like him at all and I find him extremely obnoxious. Do woman like him???? i don't!

5e41dcde6f617d07bd8e8c4de42e7a60aa	I don't know if there really is an "average age" for Weird Al Yankovic fans. When he was really big in the 80s, his biggest fan base was probaby 10-14 year olds at the time, so I guess they would be in their 30s or 40s by now, if they are still into him. On the other hand, there is a whole new generation being introduced to him nowadays, with more current albums such as "Running with Scissors", "Poodle Hat", and a brand-new one scheduled for a Sept. 26 release. But Al has said in interviews that his audiences can range from ages 8 to 80, so there really isn't any one answer. But 27 is a good age. ;)|`|AA12378784	im 15  and i like weird al!|`|d58d5b77a683e82842279c2deb115f33aa	why does it matter??|`|9c084d7637b01570fd283701bed2b058aa	Don't know.

AA12045030	technically, he's half human, half demon. but being half demon doesn't literally mean "one parent demon, other one human". you only have to have some human in you to be a hanyou (half demon). naraku was born when a whole parade of demons ate a bandit named onigumo, and released his evil heart. kikyou always mentions "onigumo's  heart", which is the part of naraku that makes him half human. he is a demon, with a human portion, onigumo's heart.|`|AA10372530	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraku" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraku</a>|`|01ab605d8683ccb105f793f947e98dfcaa	I don't know what Naraku is really.Maybe lots of demons into one.|`|6da991cf690369954da6489ea9ea3052aa	Naraku was once a human named Onigumo. He was a thief that was badly injured and tended to in a secret cave by Kikiyo. He was once in love with her, but when he found she did not feelings for him but for Inuyasha, he went into a jealous rage and had demons consume him so he could gain their power, and thus became the demon Naraku.|`|AA10585946	Inu-Yasha is Half Dog-Demon Half Human<br>  his Mother was a Human<br>  his Father was a Dog-Demon<br>  Inu-Yasha has two forms<br>  1. human form with dog ears<br>  2. fully human<br>  <br>  Naraku is Half Human half Spider-Demon<br>  Naraku used to be a Human thief named Onigumo<br>  who made a pact with some Demons with the intent to gain a body so he could win over the heart of the Priestess Kikyo and aquire ownership of the Shikon Jewel as well.<br>  a Spider Demon served as the catalist in the infection of Onigumo. the other demons were used as ingredients in the creation of Naraku's body while the Spider Demon and Onigumo fused to form the mind of Naraku. Onigumo's human heart was the only part the Demons could not corrupt.<br>  naraku has two forms<br>  1. human form<br>  2. giant spider|`|AA12144282	They're both demons, but Inu Yasha is half human and half demon.|`|2083a89a22321a49b4230ebf52b32e61aa	Naraku used to be a thief named Onigumo but he betrayed his friend and took his army. His friend found out and was really angry and burned down the building he was in. Onigumo was badly burned and Kikyo found him (I think). Kikyo took care of Onigumo and after a while, Onigumo developed feelings for her. He wanted her but first he needed a body. He called demons and told them he would give his soul to them if they would give him a body. The demons did give Onigumo a body, but it wasn't Onigumo anymore. It was Naraku.|`|ebca410137f116e363bd0dbc365d4c51aa	nuraku is a half demon. you see, he used to have a body of a human, then a whole lot of demons were stuffed inside of him, making him a half-demon. nuraku's goal is to become a full demon by gaining the shikon jewel. even though, he is a half demon, he is still powerful. naraku has a body of a half-demon, but inside, he still has a human heart.

c5aaaa7bc0de5169e89cff41344a3c80aa	Most of the singers/groups were relatively simple.  They used either an electric or acoustic guitar - usually used by the lead singer - with a drummer, someone on rhythm guitar and a bass player.  In the early days, the bass was an upright as opposed to the electric bass used now.  Some groups would have a sax and perhaps a piano, but most were just lead, rhythm, bass, and drums.    <br>  The sound was more primitive because the recording studios didn't have the technology that is in vogue today.  As a result, all the recordings were done live with everyone playing just as they would on stage. <br>  That's the basics - what you might want to do is check out some of the early Elvis recordings from Sun Records as well as Jack Scott and Buddy Holly.  The sound is very sparse.  <br>  There are tons of books out there, as to links, websites, beats me!<br>  Maybe this will help.

f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	O ADOLESCENTE<br>  O adolescente virginiano é mais sério e reservado que seus outros amigos, que n?o s?o muitos. Ele tende a fazer poucas amizades, mas quando as faz s?o realmente sinceras, recebendo toda sua dedica??o e carinho. O adolescente de Virgem costuma cuidar de seus amigos como se fossem pessoas da família, às vezes com mais intimidade que seus próprios irm?os. Muito seletivo, escolherá a dedo as pessoas para se aproximar, demorando a ter um contato mais aberto. N?o é que sejam metidos ou orgulhosos.  <br>    S?o tímidos mesmo, mas assim que estabelecem a amizade, é para sempre. E é lá que costumará procurar pessoas para namorar. Como sua timidez pode superar sua vontade de namorar, pode ser que demore um bocado para se abrir. Meio pessimista, sempre acha que n?o vai dar, que vai levar um fora, que é muita areia para o seu caminh?ozinho... porque n?o faz duas viagens ? Adolescentes já tendem a ter momentos de mau humor, quando as coisas n?o acontecem como seus sonhos e fantasias, mas pelo menos sonham. O adolescente de Virgem é muito realista pode perder a chance de arriscar e aprender. Os pais deveriam entender mais e n?o criticar tanto, pois fazendo isso só colabora para um maior distanciamento.  <br>    CONQUISTA  <br>  O Virgem exige algumas regras para ser conquistado, como n?o poderia deixar de ser. Antes de qualquer coisa, ele só vai se interessar por alguém que seja como ele : perfeito. N?o se importe com suas manias e seu jeito um tanto crítico. Os virginianos s?o muito tímidos no que se refere ao amor, e ficam um pouco encabulados na hora de abordar alguém, mas n?o deixam de demonstrar seu interesse, pelo olhar e modo diferente de se comportar. Se ele se aproximar e come?ar a querer ensinar um jeito melhor de você fazer alguma coisa... é, ele já está se interessando. <br>    Se você incentivá-lo e dar aten??o ao que ele fala, vai retribuir com fidelidade e muito amor. Nem pense em provocar-lhe ciúme. Você estará só perdendo tempo, pois ele n?o move um músculo do rosto para falar sobre isso, o que é muito estranho para alguém que sempre está fazendo críticas. Ele sente ciúmes, e muito, só que n?o demonstra, e prefere sofrer quieto, como se ele aceitasse seu interesse por outra pessoa por ele ser muito desinteressante. Esse complexo de inferioridade ainda mata o virginiano. Eles s?o muito carentes de afeto e precisam de incentivo e elogio. Só assim eles se sentem úteis e importantes. Chegue pertinho dele e vá se aconchegando. Primeiro fa?a amizade, dando-lhe aten??o e ouvindo suas explica??es. Você está a meio caminho de conquistar um Virgem para sempre.<br>     A AMIZADE<br>  Os virginianos n?o s?o de muitos amigos. N?o que sejam anti-sociais, mas é que s?o tímidos mesmo. é mais fácil você fazer amizade com ele do que ele com você. Um tanto reservados e desconfiados, eles n?o se abrem t?o facilmente, preferindo ficar à distancia, analisando e selecionando as pessoas com as quais quer ter contato. Depois de fazer amizade tenha certeza que o tratará como um irm?o. Ele tem muitas manias, e você pode achá-lo até meio chato, mas se for amigo de verdade ele vai dar ouvidos aos seus toques.   <br>    S?o ótimas companhias para algum programa de fim de semana que o leve a ter contato com a natureza, mas n?o o convide a noitadas para fazer loucuras. Eles s?o um tanto conservadores e cautelosos, n?o gostando de fazer coisas “erradas”. Agora, se você insistir um pouco ele até vai topar e vai curtir muito esse momento em que infringiu alguma regra qualquer, como se estivesse fazendo alguma arte, mesmo que seja de algo bem simples, como tomar cerveja à tarde, quando todo mundo sabe que só se toma à noite e em um bar. Eles v?o adorar fazer estas “artes” com seus amigos, e sempre v?o lembrar com carinho desses momentos juntos. Leve-o para se divertir e cair na farra. Já imaginou seu amigo virginiano vestido de Carmem Miranda com uma caipirinha na m?o em plena manh? de domingo de carnaval ? Insista... ele vai curtir. Você vai ter que insistir muito, mas vale a pena. Aí agüente... ele n?o vai querer parar de sambar t?o cedo.   <br>     VIRGEM E OUTROS RELACIONAMENTOS<br>   VIRGEM X   áRIES<br>  O ariano, nervoso e dinamico, pode gostar da praticidade do parceiro, mas se irritará com sua rotina estabelecida. Se a rela??o se iniciar com alguma proposta que tenha um objetivo comercial, depois de um certo tempo, se atravessarem o momento de crise maior, quando o ariano tenta submeter o virginiano, pode até ser possível uma rela??o mais afetiva. <br>   VIRGEM X   TOURO<br>  Pode ser uma uni?o muito positiva, já que os dois têm como objetivo produzir e manterem-se firmes. Mesmo sendo metódico o virginiano sempre se permite fazer alguns ajustes de percurso quando está numa tarefa. O Touro, mais fixo, pode se irritar com isso e com o senso crítico do virginiano. Afetivamente s?o compatíveis, mas um tanto monótonos.<br>   VIRGEM X   GêMEOS<br>  Apesar de serem muito diferentes, s?o regidos pelo mesmo planeta : Mercúrio. O virginiano pode apreciar muito a jovialidade e o senso de humor do Gêmeos, que pode gostar bastante do lado prático e dos métodos que o Virgem usa para conseguir as coisas. Pode acontecer algo inimaginável : o Virgem se declarar com ciúmes dos constantes v?os do geminiano.<br>   VIRGEM X   C?NCER<br>  O virginiano se sentirá bastante necessário na rela??o com o canceriano. T?o confuso e caótico o Cancer aceitará de bom grado os sistemas e o senso prático com que ele lida com as coisas do dia a dia. Só precisar?o de um certo tempo para estabelecer la?os de confian?a mútua. Com muita compreens?o poder?o ter uma rela??o duradoura.<br>   VIRGEM X   LE?O<br>  Uma parceria que pode atingir o equilíbrio entre a arrogancia leonina e a humildade virginiana. Quando se unem para alguma atividade profissional a senso prático de Virgem pode ser muito útil às ambi??es de Le?o, e juntos podem conseguir bons resultados. No campo afetivo talvez possa ocorrer uma certa monotonia pode corroer a rela??o.<br>   VIRGEM X   VIRGEM<br>  Só será preciso ajustar os métodos, sistemas e rotinas de cada um. Estabelecidos os ajustes os dois virginianos trabalhar?o em uníssono, dando a impress?o que foram programados com as mesmas fun??es. Será uma uni?o harm?nica. Podem cair na rotina, mas isso n?o os atrapalha. Pode acontecer de seus defeitos se acentuarem e se criticarem mutuamente.<br>   VIRGEM X   LIBRA<br>  Unindo a simpatia de Libra e a praticidade do virginiano, essa dupla poderá conseguir muita coisa no plano profissional. A tendência natural é serem muito amigos e terem muito a conversar. Se houver algum interesse afetivo, ter?o que, inicialmente, superar algumas diferen?as no que se refere à forma com que encaram os contatos sociais.<br>   VIRGEM X   ESCORPI?O<br>  Sempre que um escorpiano inicia uma rela??o envolve muita intensidade, n?o importando se é amizade ou namoro. O Virgem tende a receber isto como se fosse uma invas?o, se tornando arredio e aumentando seu senso crítico ferino, apesar de gostar desse modo objetivo com que o Escorpi?o o aborda. O escorpiano perde a paciência facilmente.<br>   VIRGEM X   SAGITáRIO<br>  Sagitarianos n?o têm regras, s?o livres e aventureiros, sempre testando novas formas de rela??o. Virginianos s?o metódicos, respeitam as regras estabelecidas e colocam-se outras. Já deu pra entender, né ? Só se houver uma identidade espiritual muito grande para esta rela??o acertar. Os virginianos n?o gostam de modos extravagantes e descompromissados.<br>   VIRGEM X   CAPRICóRNIO<br>  Dois signos reservados e conservadores, que naturalmente sentem dificuldade de demonstrar seus sentimentos. A frieza da rela??o pode tornar esta parceria eterna, mas sem calor e animo. Será necessário algum elemento dinamizador para girar energia nesta rela??o, que profissionalmente pode dar bons resultados, e por um bom tempo.<br>   VIRGEM X   AQUáRIO<br>  Nunca se viu um aquariano aceitar críticas, assim como nunca se viu um virginiano se tornar rebelde. Esse verdadeiro confronto pode levar a atritos constantes, a n?o ser se conhe?am há muitos anos e que tenham se tornados íntimos depois de muitos anos de amizade. Aí sim pode-se dizer que a rela??o tenderá, com aten??es, a ser positiva.<br>   VIRGEM X   PEIXES<br>  Opostos complementares. O pisciano levará um pouco de sonho e fantasia para o mundo t?o duro e cheio de regras do virginiano. O virginiano pode dar mais forma e praticidade ao mundo t?o disforme e caótico do pisciano, que vive em devaneio. Tende a ser uma rela??o de amor sublime, mas pode cansar por conta do constante trabalho que vai exigir.  <br>    DITADOS DESSE SIGNO<br>  "é que eu gosto das coisas bem explicadinhas, nos seus míííííííííínimos detalhes."<br>  Rony Rios<br>  "O trabalho é o amor feito invisível."<br>  Gibran<br>  "O trabalho enaltece o homem."<br>  Provérbio popular<br>  "O operário que deseja fazer bem seu trabalho deve come?ar por afiar bem seus instrumentos."<br>  Confúcio<br>  "Pessoa saudável é aquela que n?o foi suficientemente examinada."<br>  provérbio popular alem?o<br>  "Ordenar uma biblioteca é uma maneira silenciosa de exercer a arte da crítica."<br>  Jorge Luiz Borges<br>     PERFIL<br>   S?o muito críticos e n?o perdem tempo em dizer que você é muito descuidado com sua saúde ou que n?o sabe cuidar de seu carro, que notou estar fazendo um pequeno barulho na roda quando faz curvas em subidas à esquerda . <br>   HOJE 14/12/2006<br>  Trate de mudar algumas coisas em sua casa.

O símbolo do signo retrata a purifica??o e a colheita.<br>  <br>  * Caracteristicas: desejo de servir e ser útil, mente prática, análise, ordem, aperfei?oamento, dedica??o, detalhe, perfeccionismo, crítica, exigência, inquieta??o, sentimento de culpa, timidez.<br>  <br>  23 de Agosto a 22 de Setembro<br>  <br>  Elemento: Terra<br>  For?as: Noturnas, feminina<br>  Planeta Regente: Mercúrio e Vulcano<br>  Flores: amores perfeitos, alecrim<br>  <br>  Virgem inicia-se a 23 de Agosto e prolonga-se até 22 de Setembro. O nativo tradicional tem natureza prática e responsável; é minuncioso, exato, atento aos pormenores; é crítico, motivo que o leva a ser muito cético em rela??o a tudo o que n?o vê ou foge a padr?es tradicionais.<br>  <br>  Cultiva o gosto pela cultura sobretudo através da leitura. Como é signo de Terra, os imprevistos incomodam-nos e é pouco dado a mudan?as ou rupturas sem programa??o prévia. O Virgem, Vulcano foge um pouco a este padr?o.<br>  <br>  Características:<br>  Luz: Discriminativo, Racional, Laborioso,<br>  capacidade de servir, propenso à ordem e funcionalidade.<br>  Sombra: Excessivamente perfeccionista,<br>  Crítico e auto-crítico, céptico, agarrado ao detalhe.<br>  Os Virginianos s?o metódicos, exatos, minuciosos,ordeiros, eficazes e eficientes.<br>  Gostam de ler e de adquirir conhecimento em várias áreas.<br>  S?o, ao mesmo tempo, cépticos e fanáticos,incrédulos e supersticiosos.<br>  N?o gostam de ser interrompidos, mas se isso acontece<br>  sempre retomam o assunto do ponto em que pararam.<br>  S?o críticos e bons de argumenta??o, excelentes defensores<br>  do próprio raciocínio. Gostam de dar conselhos e costumam acertar em muitas previs?es.<br>  Possuem bom senso, lógica e capacidade para ver além dos acontecimentos imediatos.<br>  Trabalhar com virginianos é trabalhar como se estivéssemos num quartel.<br>  Tudo arrumado e organizado, limpo e quase esterilizado.<br>  Eles têm um pique de trabalho incrível,<br>  e sempre trazem solu??es criativas e inovadoras.<br>  <br>  O beijo de Virgem:<br>  O virginiano é perfeccionista até no beijo. Que grande qualidade! Ele toma o maior cuidado para que a pessoa amada se sinta plenamente envolvida pela carícia de seus lábios suaves e de sua língua ávida de sensa??es. é um beijo intenso, molhado, delicioso!<br>  <br>  Defeitos de Virgem:<br>  Culpa do Prazer – Baixa Auto-estima – O virginiano n?o consegue se dar prazer. Nas horas reservadas a ele,inventa alguma ocupa??o mais séria e se entrega a essa obriga??o,esquecendo por completo o lazer antes programado.Sendo Virgem o signo de mais baixa auto-estima do Zodíaco,sente-se em pecado quando está apenas se divertindo e n?o se dá o direito de desperdi?ar momentos subtraídos do seu precioso tempo.é muito fácil para ele adiar o prazer indefinidamente,só se entregando após muita relutancia e quando mais nada existe, na sua agenda,de alguma importancia.Quando vence o conflito entre prazer e dever,o virginiano come?a a se divertir,assumindo todos os encargos dos preparativos necessários. Se é um jogo de cartas, ele irá providenciar o baralho, as fichas,o pano verde e tudo mais.Se for uma viagem,ele cuida das malas,dos horários,das compras mais difíceis,dos mapas,e tudo mais que envolva a parte trabalhosa do lazer.Prefere o prazer cerebral,trabalhoso,que o obrigue a raciocinar,do que o prazer do tipo ver um p?r-do-sol,brincar com crian?as ou apreciar um passeio no bosque. Ele prefere uma mixagem entre prazer e autopuni??o.<br>  <br>  Trabalhador Compulsivo – A baixa auto-estima do virginiano o leva a trabalhar exaustivamente,sem respeitar seus próprios limites.Chega a um tal nível de casaco,que ultrapassa as normas aceitáveis de saúde e,por isso,est?o sempre “à beira de um ataque de nervos”,deixando transparecer uma agita??o interna e um estresse incontroláveis.A causa desse comportamento compulsivo reside numa autocobran?a que o obriga a fazer e refazer,até atingir uma utópica perfei??o.<br>  <br>  Sabotador – Quando o virginiano aceita um trabalho com o qual n?o concorda e para o qual n?o tem outra alternativa,ele tende a agir como sabotador.Cria conflitos,inicia greves injustas,faz reivindica??es absurdas causando prejuízos.Uma criatura com alma de escravo, que se sente inferiorizado pelo sistema.Só enxerga seus direitos e ignora os deveres.Para ele,o patr?o ou o chefe é sempre um inimigo a perseguir e a se vingar.<br>  <br>  Hipocondríaco – Pela necessidade de preservar sua saúde,esse hábito pode se tornar uma mania compulsiva e um medo constante de qualquer tipo de doen?a. Trata exageradamente de todos os possíveis sintomas e imaginados sintomas como se fossem uma realidade inquestionável.Vive procurando uma doen?a real para justificar sua neurose por medicamentos.é assíduo freqüentador de consultórios médicos, e desses contatos se resulta um grande conhecimento de termos técnicos e cultura de almanaques especializados.<br>  <br>  Preven??o – Os virginianos que fazem da preven??o uma religi?o,vivem tomando vitaminas,vacinas e adotando regimes alimentares com ênfase obrigatória na saúde.N?o comem por prazer,comem porque faz bem à saúde.S?o os únicos no Zodíaco que seguem prescri??es com total obediência e orgulho.<br>  <br>  Manias – As qualidades de limpeza,ordem e arruma??o viram manias,e o virginiano n?o pára de se lavar e limpar tudo em seu raio de a??o.Essas manias levam o virginiano à se autocobrar de uma maneira excessiva,o que o faz detalhista compulsivo,ranheta,preso a rigores inúteis;cansativo no convívio e terrivelmente prolixo,pois além de falar muito,o virginiano ainda tem obsess?o por detalhes tediosamente repetitivos.<br>  <br>  Dificuldades no Amor – Os virginianos s?o pouco carinhosos,n?o acreditam em paix?o, amor à primeira vista,efus?es amorosas,“reencontros que tinham que acontecer”,romances,namoros complicados,“melosidades”,amores impossíveis,aventuras novelescas,pieguismos,“pessoas-colantes” e muito mais. De tudo que a literatura romantica escreveu nos séculoso virginiano desconfia.é um tipo muito cabe?a, cético e que leva tempo para esquentar.Teme,portanto,deixar-se envolver por algumas ingenuidades romanescas como os outros signos.é preciso dedica??o para derreter esse “iceberg”.<br>  <br>  Critica quem Ama – No seu intuito de aperfei?oar o comportamento do companheiro, o virginiano vai desfiando um rosário de críticas.é difícil namorar ouvindo relatórios de seus defeitos.Diz a Astrologia que os virginianos,quando criticam, est?o dando prova de grande interesse e até de amor,mas a maioria das outras pessoas n?o tolera ser criticada e nem aprecia uma personalidade categórica e autocontida.<br>  E aí?Gostou?<br>  Aguardo resposta...<br>  Bjus =]|`|3b78a2fb1d5e69f27d1fe6d1bcb17846aa	Tenho mam?e como referência:<br>  A pessoa de Virgem é uma observadora nata, nada lhe escapa, pois sua mente está anotando tudo.<br>  <br>  DEFEITOS:<br>  <br>  *Teimosia<br>  *Possesividade<br>  *Críticos na avalia??o de terceiros(até mais que deveriam ser, porém n?o aceitam críticas por sempre buscar o perfeccionismo).

Se você acha que ele é muito crítico e exigente com você, imagine como é consigo mesmo... Leva a autocrítica ao extremo e pode se sentir responsável e culpado por qualquer coisa que sai errado. Costuma ser um pouco tenso e irritadi?o - ajude-o a relaxar. Inteligentes e observadores, virginianos apreciam toques de humor e ironia, mas n?o em cima deles, claro. Muitos s?o sérios e rigorosos, vai ser bom fazê-los rir e brincar. Questionadores, racionais, podem levar algum tempo para entender uma boa piada. Há também, mais raros, aqueles que s?o bem ao contrário, os que riem sozinhos (e fazem os outros rirem), se divertindo com os detalhes t?o pequenos da vida cotidiana e das pessoas. De uma forma ou outra, est?o atentos às sutilezas e v?o gostar de ver que você está ligado às suas percep??es e é cúmplice de suas idéias.|`|b3354772797e64842691a820138120e5aa	bem lucas eu também sou de virgem!<br>  o virginiano é perfeccionista, detalhista, romantico odeia que peguem no seu pé(namorado grudento) ama a liberdade.

Este é formado de células chamadas neur?nios, que formam entre si liga??es chamadas sinapses, ou caminhos de energia eletroquímica. Daí haver libera??o de endorfinas, drogas produzidas pelo corpo que causam prazer e podem levar à dependência de certas pessoas, alimentos, lugares, hábitos e vícios. E você é viciado nessa pessoa. Quando descobrir isso, procurará outras pessoas ou atividades que far?o você ver como estava sendo tolo por chamar de "amor" a uma simples dependência psicológica. Amor n?o existe, é só uma palavra. Pode haver amor entre pais e filhos, nunca entre um homem e uma mulher. Além da dependência, o que existe é desejo, paix?o, tes?o, e também interesse, além do sexual, o financeiro, político, social etc. Entre homem e mulher, na melhor hipótese, pode haver AFINIDADE, ent?o poder?o ser os dois COMPATíVEIS e até COMPLEMENTARES, que é o segredo das uni?es bem sucedidas.

But the possible pitfalls are, power struggles or boredom because you are too much alike and eventually you realize the spark is not there. Aries likes a challenge and someone just like you will not challenge you. It can be very difficult to have an Aries/Aries relationship because neither want to give in. Which eventually builds resentment....I know! But If there is a strong compatible (such as Leo or Sagittarius ) influence one of your charts..especially your rising sign or moon sign this can work well.

Well if it is about a game, vfx is voice effects, sfx is sound effects, and animation must be the quality of graphics. I'm guessing that this is not even  the right topic, lol. But if it is, then I hope it helped. :)

Every year Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." <br>  And every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars." <br>  <br>  One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance." <br>  <br>  Martha replied, "Stumpy, that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars." <br>  <br>  The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal, I'll take you both up for a ride.

He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. "I'm lost," said the man. "Can you put me up for the night?" <br>  "Certainly," the Chinese man said, "but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man." <br>  <br>  "Ok," said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. <br>  <br>  Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. <br>  <br>  He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, "Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest." "Well, that's pretty crappy," he thought. "If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about." He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: "Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle." In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, "Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost." <br>  .................................<br>  <br>  A large, powerfully-built guy meets a woman at a bar.

That''s 1000 pounds of dynamite!" She is aching for action at this point.<br>  <br>  Finally, he drops his underpants, and after a quick glance, she grabs her purse and runs screaming to the front door.<br>  <br>  He catches her before she is able to leave and asks, "Why are you in such a hurry to go?"<br>  <br>  She replies, "With 2000 pounds of dynamite and such a short fuse, I was afraid you were about to blow!"<br>  .................................<br>  <br>  A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time. <br>  <br>  Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. <br>  <br>  At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. <br>  <br>  That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!" <br>  <br>  The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. <br>  <br>  A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. <br>  <br>  10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. <br>  <br>  Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious."<br>  <br>  The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist." <br>  .................................<br>  A man goes to his doctor and says, ''Doctor, Doctor, please help me!

AA10673599	Well there was a bit of controversy behind the Ash and Misty relationship. Misty crush on Ash was confirmed in the Pokeman CD called 2BA Master and even though it was not directly said in the anime, there were hints to how Misty felt about Ash. In episodes " The Heart Break of Brock, she tells Ash "You and I will be married some day too" and in the episode "Gota Catch you Later" she sings "You're more than my Best Friend" to Ash. There were fans that tried to demand Nintendo to depict  Ash and Misty as lovers dubbed as "Pokeman Shipping" but it never came about because a new idea was being supported by fans called "Advanced Shipping" where Ash and his new traveling partner May have crushes on each other since Misty is no longer one of the main characters in Pokeman. You can look at the second link to decide about Ash and Misty's relationship. ^_^ Misty goes back  as a gym leader in  Cerulean City .

iGeDZ89kaa	It's called diaphragm control.  You have to take a deep breath and sing from your diaphragm, not your throat (or your nose, LOL!).  It takes a  LOT of practice and a LOT of control, but anyone can do it.  To practice, stand up really straight, take a deep breath, and start singing a note.  Push in on your diaphragm, and notice the difference...then start working on controlling your breathing when you are holding out the note...and don't breathe from your nose.  It's hard to explain, but once you start practicing, you will find your diaphragm and control getting stronger.  <br>  <br>  Also, it's IMPOSSIBLE to take a breath during a note and "hide" it....the only way you can hide it is when singing in a choir.  :o)|`|LneJ9nSuaa	you have to sing from the diaphragm and not the stomach....and the best way to tell if someone can really sing is to sing the first line of the star spangled banner in falsetto...not your regular voice....|`|kNTCEo5xaa	you can't hide that... they take a HUGE breath before they start and practice a hell of a whole lot before they have to perform

e4c3ca6d2527805a742d68797c51b43eaa	It's usually set up at a big venue in the parking lot, yes the parking lot there are usually around 8-10 different stages, there are like 3-4 main stages where you will see the "bigger" bands and then the rest are smaller stages where you will see the bands that are more unknown.  It's an awesome time not only do you get to see bands that you already love but you get to see new bands that you might like, it's an all day event it starts around 10 or 11 am and ends around 10 pm.  They also have half pipes set up for skaters, there are little shops and stands all over where you can join street teams and get free stuff, you get sooo much free sh*t at warped tour it's ridiculous.  They have local radio stations there and every band has it's own stand where you can buy merch or hang out until the band is done performing and then you can get autographs and pictures with the bands.  Just make sure you bring lots of sunscreen, water unless you want to pay 4 dollars for a bottle of it, your camera and coll clothes it is usually hot as hell!  But Trust me it's worth it!  You won't know what stage and time each band is on until you get there when they give you your warped schedule or tell you where one is posted.  It's kind of like a mini punk rock city for the day, with stages and concerts going on all day long.  Have fun!

In order to accommodate the number of bands set to play, they run multiple stages at once (it's been usually about 8 stages, in my experience.) The day of the show, the band list is usually posted online, so that you know which band plays when and where. If not, there will be boards all over the venue stating this information. You have to plan your day around who you want to see! It's very fun.<br>  <br>  As for times... it starts quite early, around 10:00am or 11:00am, but the big bands won't be playing that early, so if you don't feel like making it a full day, you can usually get there around 2 without missing any of the more popular ones. The show will run late, until about 10:00pm.<br>  <br>  In addition to bands, the venue will be made into a tent city, full of merchandise booths, video game booths, skating ramps (though not so much anymore), and other tiny interactive areas. There was a very popular Levi's jeans tent-trailer the last time I went... they did some full body scan on you and then gave you a bandana... hah. Anyway.<br>  <br>  You can expect to pay A LOT for food and drink, but that's just the way it goes. You can't bring in your own food, and unfortunately I think in most venues, you can't leave to go get food. But the jury's out on that one.<br>  <br>  In terms of show-quality... if you're used to going to concerts, it's going to have a massively different feel, but either way it's usually enjoyable. It's a very loose setting... lots of people seeing lots of bands that they probably didn't plan on seeing. Overall, though, I try to go once every couple of years for the fun value. Go in a group if you can. That makes it better. And go see Alkaline Trio! They're on this year.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you need any other info! Have fun!|`|f15865d3558c793f3b6ce1c03f21b757aa	<a href="http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warped_Tour" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warped_Tour</a>|`|pDv13gJwaa	<a href="http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/ind...</a>  <br>  <br>  a quick internet search and waaaaa la

Big boobs.  <br>  <br>  Women weren't designed to have small boobs, it's just where over the years, women have lost their curves, and have become skinnier, there for a more straight mansculine figure.  I think that's why there are a few people who claim to prefer smaller boobs...fashon, role models like Kate Moss, Sienna Miller etc.  I think it's instinct for a man to be more attracted to a busty woman than a flat chested woman.  <br>  <br>  What are boobs for?  To attract men and feed children.  They're there for a reason, the bigger they are the more firtile we look. Plus they're a lot sexier.<br>  <br>  Sorry to all you flat chesters but it's the truth, ask any HONEST  man.|`|o99uw2jqaa	I love big boobs; I want to be friends with them.|`|d0oGeasiaa	Small boobs|`|iQT8gJcvaa	playboy style, gotta love tha curves.

f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	eu gostei e achei muito legal os filhos da carola e do arnaldo,o ator que fez o filho eu nao achei tao parecido.|`|2df9b766c39bdd1e58de398ab97a623eaa	Eu assisti, mas n?o gostei do final, achei fraco. O ator que fez o Daniel é irm?o do Thiago Fragoso, eles se parecem muito mesmo.|`|449bbf4ab51653545ec8d0e7ee973ebbaa	Achei muito basica, mas legal.Uma dica: assista o filme: o ilusionista ..saiu do cinema quase agora, e foi nele que a novela foi baseado ( no livro, que deu origem tambem a esse filme) ...E quanto ao menino..n?o sei..mas ele tinha que ser parecido com o ator que fez pai dele ..para parecer mais real.

r4RPCjmGaa	The Fire Nation is a kingdom of Fire Benders(note that there are also earth, water, and airbenders[one of those left]). The fire nation attacked the fellow kingdoms a century ago and took over many towns, cities, etc. The air kingdom ceases to exist, and the fire nation took over the earth kingdom in recent episodes. They are basically an evil empire who only the avatar can destroy. <br>  <br>  Jet holds a deep-seated grudge against the Fire Nation for an attack by the Rough Rhinos that killed his parents when he was eight. He and his ragtag group spend their days antagonizing Fire Nation soldiers and emigrants on the outskirts of their occupied town, living in forest tree-houses. He uses Twin Tiger-Head Hook swords for combat as well as to maneuver through the trees. When Katara met him, she became infatuated with the charismatic rogue, but quickly doused these feelings after Sokka discovered and thwarted Jet's plans to use captured blasting jelly to destroy a dam and flood an Earth Kingdom town occupied by Fire Nation troops, killing both enemy soldiers and innocent civilians living there. He apparently thinks 'sacrifices' must be made. In anger, she freezes him to a tree, then leaves.<br>  <br>  Jet is marked by his almost pathological hatred of the Fire Nation. To him, all citizens of the Fire Nation are guilty, regardless of whether they are involved with the war or not. In some ways he represents what could have happened to Katara and Sokka after the death of their mother; allowing their hatred to consume them.<br>  <br>  With all of that said, if you want to study avatar in greater depth go to <a href="http://www.theavatarportal.com/episodes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theavatarportal.com/episodes....</a> and you can watch any episode of avatar the last airbender.|`|M9qxToXPaa	The fire nation is a nation of fire benders and people born into the nation. Basically they can produce fire with their body and hand movements in various ways. They are trying to take over the whole world one nation at a time. So far they have gotten rid of all of the air nations and have made many successful and some unsuccessful attempts at the water and earth kingdoms.<br>  <br>  Jet: They burned down his town and took his parents. Apparently he saw it happen and he was one of the few who survived from his town. So now he seeks revenge in all possible wayshe can against anyone who is fire nation.|`|GZDkke3haa	they killed his parents think so because i saw that episdoes 2 or 3 years agoish|`|OyWEhtyQaa	There are diffrent nations such as the water, earth, wind and fire the fire betrayed everyone and took over jet i think he fought with his dad and got that scar on his face and thats why he hates them and is cursed to catch the avatar then he can come home and get respect from his father again.

O acometido de paix?o perde sua individualidade em fun??o do fascínio que o outro exerce sobre ele. é tipicamente um sentimento doloroso e patológico, porque, via de regra, o indivíduo perde a sua individualidade, a sua identidade e o seu poder de raciocínio.<br>  <br>  Pode-se dizer também que paix?o é algo muito mais passageiro, que após a paix?o, vem o amor, que é um sentimento muito mais forte e duradouro.<br>  <br>  O sentimento exacerbado entre duas pessoas, é um exemplo de uma paix?o. A paix?o pode ultrapassar barreiras sociais, diferen?as de forma??o, idades e géneros. A paix?o completamente correspondida causa grandiosa felicidade e satisfa??o ao apaixonado, pelo contrário qualquer dificuldade para antigir essa plenitude pode trazer grande tristeza pois o apaixonado só se vê feliz ao conseguir o objeto de sua paix?o.|`|7ee91c4d6a5a27290d9b06e6dd828a22aa	Odiei e até parei de ver a novela como via antes.

Sendo um signo masculino e duplo, tem um conflito entre as suas duas metades, a primeira humana e a segunda animal. <br>  <br>  O nativo deste signo é expansivo, e espa?oso! Ama os países estrangeiros, as grandes viagens, as aventuras e as coisas extravagantes e aprecia a vida saudável, a dan?a e os esportes ao ar livre; entre estes privilegia os cavalos e os esportes de grande velocidade.<br>  <br>  Tem atra??o pelas religi?es e filosofias, especialmente orientais, e também pelas coisas da lei e da justi?a. S?o excelentes diplomatas e juristas, e também podem seguir a carreira religiosa. <br>  <br>  Adora o comercio exterior e a navega??o intercontinental, tudo para ele é grande: o Sagitariano n?o pensa pequeno. Ser de grandes idéias, imagina-se o próprio Júpiter reinando no Olimpo, e por esta raz?o acha que tudo lhe é permitido, tornando-o às vezes excessivamente generoso e um pouco "folgado". Sendo um pouco aventureiro é também algo infiel! <br>  <br>  Tem qualidades de adaptabilidade, vitalidade e entusiasmo, um excessivo otimismo. Possui também uma grande sabedoria, intui??o e mesmo o dom de profecia. Gosta de fazer prega??es e ensinar. <br>  <br>  Entre seus defeitos existe uma certa imprudência, o gosto pelo risco e pelo jogo, o gosto pela aventura e a consciência "elástica", que ele usa para se desculpar de todas suas atitudes. Sendo excessivamente idealista e otimista, n?o avalia bem o lado prático de suas a??es, se decepcionando em seguida e por isso precisa de encorajamento muito mais do que ele deixa transparecer. <br>  <br>  O ponto fraco em seu organismo s?o as coxas e as nádegas e ancas. <br>  <br>  Sagitário e o Amor: <br>  Sendo um bom amigo, sente prazer em ouvir e ser ouvido. Quando se apaixonam, podem entrar com bastante entusiasmo nas rela??es, mas por outro lado, ser?o bastante livres e independentes para buscar um outro amor "um pouco mais longe". A grama do vizinho é sempre mais verde! Cuidado para n?o se engajar em vários relacionamentos, já que n?o suporta o tédio sexual. Um relacionamento é total e completo quando há também uma certa fidelidade, n?o é? <br>  Dificilmente permitirá porém, que o casamento o monopolize, já que suas necessidades intensas parecem incompatíveis com um relacionamento estável e duradouro. Deve partir por uma rela??o aberta, onde ambos os parceiros busquem completar o outro, sem monopolizá-lo. <br>  <br>  Sagitário e a Casa: <br>  Qual a casa ideal para um sagitariano? Um avi?o, ou até um navio!!! Sim, porque o nato sob o signo de Sagitário, n?o para muito tempo num só lugar. Ele está sempre "entre duas partidas". Sua casa está repleta de lembran?as do seu passado, mas está sempre pronto para receber aquelas do futuro. O mundo é t?o vasto, parece dizer cada objeto. Uma foto de seu cavalo preferido, lembra ao Sagitariano que a aventura é um esporte aristocrático... Ao mesmo tempo senhor e vagabundo, este nato sabe tornar mais nobre a decora??o de sua vida, mesmo preservando sua liberdade. Muitos objetos étnicos, de países distantes, o lembrar?o de deixar uma mala sempre pronta. <br>  E o quarto do Sagitariano como será? é quase como um hall de entrada para os seus sonhos, que o levam para as suas viagens longínquas, para suas aventuras. As cores s?o fortes, as madeiras nobres, que lembrem as areias douradas do deserto, ou as florestas verdejantes. O conforto é primordial e a cama, esta deve ser imensa!<br>  <br>  Sagitário & Sagitário <br>  <br>  Como vocês pertencem ao mesmo signo, têm mil e uma afinidades, a come?ar pela alegria de viver e pelo enorme espírito aventureiro que faz com que adorem as viagens e tenham um fascínio todo especial em conhecer lugares novos e povos diferentes. Assim, ser?o excelentes companheiros e poder?o compartilhar momentos maravilhosos juntos. Além disso, cada um sabe entender e respeitar a necessidade de liberdade do outro. Juntos, vocês v?o se sentir inteiramente à vontade, sem ter nada que os limite ou tolha. O problema é que, como ambos s?o instáveis e n?o gostam de assumir para valer uma rela??o, as coisas entre vocês podem ficar um pouco no ar, mal definidas. Com o tempo, poder?o se afastar exatamente em fun??o dessa falta de defini??o -mesmo porque um n?o gosta de ficar cobrando o outro. Sob os len?óis as coisas tendem a correr magnificamente bem, pois vocês dois s?o muito sensuais e possuem intensas necessidades físicas. <br>  <br>  Sagitário & Sagitário <br>  <br>  Como vocês pertencem ao mesmo signo, têm mil e uma afinidades, a come?ar pela alegria de viver e pelo enorme espírito aventureiro que faz com que adorem as viagens e tenham um fascínio todo especial em conhecer lugares novos e povos diferentes.

Uma rela??o com muita lealdade e extremo senso de coopera??o. Nas rela??es afetivas precisará de um certo tempo para estabilizar tanto fogo. Profissionalmente é uma ótima combina??o, só faltando um pouco de praticidade. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   TOURO<br>  A amizade tende a ser longa e duradoura. O animado sagitariano dá mais movimento à vida do calmo taurino. Quando se trata de rela??es afetivas, talvez o taurino n?o agüente a necessidade de aventura e liberdade do Sagitário. Com seu ciúme e possessividade tende a espantar o sagitariano em pouco tempo. Só se o taurino mudar e confiar mais. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   GêMEOS<br>  Como ambos têm o mesmo temperamento aventureiro e descomplicado, é uma rela??o que pode dar muito certo, em todos os sentidos. Desencanados por natureza, o relacionamento estará baseado na amizade e no companheirismo. No relacionamento afetivo pode ocorrer um certo distanciamento por parte do geminiano, mas os la?os de amizade superam tudo. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   C?NCER<br>  Toda rela??o é baseada em amor e compreens?o, e cada um deve ceder um pouco para conviver melhor com o outro. Apegado ao passado e muito romantico, o canceriano poderá sentir-se rejeitado pelo apaixonado sagitariano que com o passar do tempo n?o movimenta??o na rela??o. A amizade entre eles pode resultar numa melhor rela??o. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   LE?O<br>  Sendo os dois signos de fogo e apaixonados e romanticos, pode existir uma rela??o de amor e afinidade incríveis. Talvez o sagitariano n?o aceite t?o facilmente o autoritarismo natural do Le?o, t?o egocêntrico quanto o Sagitário. Moderando sua impulsividade o sagitariano pode conviver muito bem com o leonino, tanto afetiva como profissionalmente. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   VIRGEM<br>  O pacato e discreto virginiano pode se assustar um pouco com a extrovers?o e a alegria naturais do Sagitário. O conformismo e a humildade de Virgem costuma incomodar o t?o elétrico e desencanado Sagitário. Mesmo assim pode haver uma atra??o pela praticidade do Virgem, o que colabora para o Sagitário realizar seus sonhos e projetos. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   LIBRA<br>  Uma uni?o bastante saudável que pode durar muito tempo, podendo ser uma rela??o afetiva ou profissionalmente enriquecedora. Bastante sociáveis ter?o momentos de muita felicidade junto aos amigos que tanto prezam. Muito mais compreensivo, o libriano terá mais condi??es de se adaptar ao exagerado e extrovertido Sagitário. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   ESCORPI?O<br>  Muito intensos nos relacionamentos, a paix?o é inevitável. Após os contatos iniciais a paix?o se torna amor e companheirismo, mas o sagitariano pode se incomodar com o controle e o ciúme doentio que pode se manifestar no escorpiano frente à extrovers?o e facilidade com que o Sagitário estabelece contatos com as pessoas. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   SAGITáRIO<br>  Uma uni?o em que a amizade será o maior trunfo para tornar a rela??o mais duradoura. Um fogo de paix?o enorme pode existir no início da rela??o. Troca de opini?es sobre quest?es filosóficas e éticas podem produzir altos papos. Isso pode levar a constantes confrontos e minar a rela??o. Profissionalmente pode ocorrer maior afinidade, ajudando na parceria. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   CAPRICóRNIO<br>  O brincalh?o e extrovertido sagitariano n?o costuma receber bem a sisudez e a cautela do Capricórnio numa rela??o afetiva. Com o convívio pode ocorrer maior proximidade. Com sua tendência a cobrar responsabilidades, o capricorniano pode irritar e afastar o Sagitário. Profissionalmente é uma excelente combina??o, produtiva e criativa. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   AQUáRIO<br>  Uma rela??o bastante harmoniosa, o que pode resultar em um casal alegre e moderno, sendo divertido e descomplicado. Muito idealistas, est?o sempre abertos a novos rumos e novas formas de amar e entender o mundo. Sempre esperando bastante um do outro, pode existir uma expectativa muito grande que pode ocasionar decep??es com o tempo. <br>  <br>   SAGITáRIO X   PEIXES<br>  O pisciano responde bem aos sonhos e desejos de aventura do Sagitário. Tendo sua liberdade preservada e suas fantasias incentivadas o sagitariano sente bastante afeto pelo pisciano, que responde com amor e aten??o. Pode faltar senso de praticidade e muitos de seus sonhos caírem no vazio por falta de um embasamento maior.|`|6511b90c9739e4f315b7d70e510f999faa	N?o tem problema entre vc e seu namorado, além de seu signo combinar com ariés, le?o, sagitário, gêmeos, libra, aquário, peixes e virgem, mas cuidado com cancer, escorpi?o, capricórnio e touro.

Pelo signo, mostra como a pessoa procura se desenvolver e confiar na vida. <br>  A qualidade: Mutável  pertence aos signos de Gêmeos, Virgem, Sagitário e Peixes. As principais características desses nativos s?o as que se relacionam à muta??o, à adapta??o e ao acordo. S?o flexíveis e mudam de atitude ou opini?o se assim for necessário. As pessoas com esta Qualidade s?o mutáveis e versáteis e n?o vêem nenhuma dificuldade nas mudan?as, s?o os camale?es do zodíaco. Aqueles que têm influencia da Qualidade mutável em seus Mapas adoram aprender, saber e s?o justos e diplomáticos. Isso talvez devido à capacidade de enxergar os problemas e suas solu??es rapidamente. <br>  Deve-se tomar cuidado, porém, para n?o confundir a adapta??o com a apatia. Essas pessoas podem cair em um redemoinho ao tentar sempre agradar àqueles que o cercam,mas s?o, sem dúvida, amigos com quem se pode contar. <br>  Finalmente, estas pessoas s?o fortes, criativas e divertidas, e s?o uma inspira??o aos seus amigos e familiares. Mas n?o os provoque nem irrite, quando eles se zangam, é pra valer. Além disso, podem ser bastante "mand?es" e autoritários quando querem ou precisam, e chegam a for?ar seu caminho e escolhas aos outros que o cercam. <br>  Com a polaridade Positiva esses nativos est?o sempre à frente, têm a iniciativa de agir ao invés de ficarem sentados, esperando que as coisas venham até eles. <br>  Eles possuem uma agressividade positiva, ou seja, est?o sempre prontos para ir à luta e brigar pelo que querem e acreditam. Dependendo da posi??o desses signos positivos no seu Mapa Astral, as casas que representam as áreas de sua vida ser?o influenciadas por essa polaridade.

Eles empalideceriam como a luz de nossas lampadas ao sol da manh?. O prazer seria eclipsado pelo gozo.<br>  <br>         Gozo seria de fato a simplicidade de vida que a intui??o mística propagasse no mundo; gozo ainda o que acompanhasse automaticamente uma vis?o do além numa experiência científica ampliada.  Na falta de uma reforma moral t?o completa,será preciso recorrer a expedientes, submeter-se a uma  "regulamenta??o"  cada vez mais dominante, derrubar um por um os obstáculos que nossa natureza ergue contra nossa civiliza??o.  Mas, quer optemos pelos grandes meios ou pelos pequenos,  uma decis?o se imp?e.  A humanidade geme,  meio esmagada sob o peso do progresso que conseguiu. Ela sabe o suficiente que seu futuro depende dela. Cabe-lhe primeiro ver se quer continuar a viver. Cabe-lhe indagar depois  se quer viver apenas , ou fazer um esfor?o a mais para que se realize . em nosso planeta refratário , a fun??o essencial do universo , que  é uma máquina de fazer deuses."<br>  <br>  Assim Bergson encerra  o Capítulo IV,o último do seu livro  AS DUAS  FONTES DA MORAL E DA RELIGI?O<br>  (Está na Cole??o  Os Pensadores - Abril Cultural -1979|`|JeQN6E3taa	" de q adianta estudar a vida inteira<br>  se tudo que eu preciso saber está <br>  na filosofia dos seus pensamentos<br>  na história dos seus olhos<br>  na geografia do seu corpo<br>  e na quimica dos seus beijos"<br>  <br>  "queria ser poeta<br>  mas poeta nao posso ser<br>  poeta pensa em tudo<br>  e eu só penso em vc"<br>  <br>  "se um dia a chama da nossa amizade acabar...fo.das.se<br>  a gente acende uma vela" <br>  <br>  "os amigos nao sao aqueles q dizem:<br>  -va em frente...<br>  mas sao os que dizem:<br>  -vou contigo!!!"<br>  <br>  huahuahua<br>  bjo.O|`|X6tW8qghaa	Eu te amo!<br>  Quando ouvi isso pela primeira vez, do meu namorado, me senti nas nuvens e ao mesmo tempo achando que n?o era aquilo que estava ouvindo!!<br>  <br>  Boa tarde!|`|YnKbQsriaa	''AQUILO QUE N?O NOS MATA, NOS DEIXA MAIS FORTE''<br>   acho que a frase original n?o é no plural mas vale a pena apresenta-la no plural aqui.<br>  eu acho essa frase estimulante e também  reconfortante,eu a vejo como uma síntese da vida do ser humano que pode aprender com cada inexperiência,ao superar uma dificuldade e fortalecer-se com isso!|`|ch8tVRCoaa	tem várias: "a felicidade é o bem que se multiplica ao ser dividido"( Marxwell Maltz) " a arte é t?o difícil quanto o amor" ( Glauber Rocha) " amar é jamais ter de pedir perd?o"|`|d909f778958a8c3c4ec8fca7575b53a2aa	"Podem me xingar, xingamento nenhum me desanima ,pois eu sou o que sou, e n?o o que os outros dizem."<br>  "Se vale realmente a pena fazer algo, vale fazê-la a qualquer custo." <br>  <br>  "No tear que tece a nossa vida n?o há pontas soltas.

Eu levo em considera??o os dois pontos que vc colocou: a ortografia e a idéia. A palavra é o meio de comunica??o mais imediato do homem (vamos entender que a palavra também pode ser usada de forma gestual - no caso de pessoas com deficiência de fala) com o homem. Quando o homem fala uma palavra de forma errada e, mesmo assim, ele consegue se fazer entender, o objetivo foi alcan?ado: ele conseguiu se comunicar.  Esta é a fun??o da palavra: a comunica??o.  Quando o homem escreve uma palavra errada, na minha opini?o, tem outro peso: a leitura se faz necessária; existem pessoas que, mesmo com pouquíssimos recursos financeiros, se interessam pela leitura; essas pessoas dificilmente escrevem errado ... A palavra escrita, nos dias de hoje, ficou em segundo plano: tudo pode ser feito no computador, até esquecermos de usar os acentos gráficos, até abreviarmos palavras que n?o suportam essa  abrevia??o, até fazermos amigos, até namorarmos, até ... n?o !

Filipa (Sara Salgado), que só tem olhos para o namorado Gon?alo (António Camelier), mas tem a vida dificultada n?o só por causa de ter um pai muito conservador mas também por ter um irm?o, Rui (Pedro Caeiro), que a controla a pedido do pai. A "vil?" de servi?o é Tania Lobo (Teresa Rolla).Também as divergências entre Maria José (Ana Zanatti) e o antigo director de S?o Rafael, Augusto Ravina (Júlio César), prometem aquecer o ambiente do novo Colégio.<br>  <br>  <br>  Série III (2005-2006)<br>  Matilde Gouveia (Joana Duarte) e Tiago Borges (Luís Louren?o) s?o os protagonistas desta série e de uma história de amor que come?ou em Cuba, num incidente de mergulho.

A cada ano lectivo, o elenco da série é renovado. Algumas personagens antigas saem e entram outras personagens novas num sistema rotativo para manter o interesse do público, ficando apenas personagens que n?o excedem os dois anos de existência. Neste momento, a personagem com mais longevidade na série é Manel Gouveia (Tiago Felizardo).<br>  <br>  Até agora, as personagens com mais longevidade na série e as únicas excep??es a esta regra foram Marta Navarro (Ana Guiomar) e Rodas (Tiago Aldeia). Em séries anteriores, as personagens secundárias mais proeminentes foram o Professor Sapinho (Guilherme Filipe), a Professora Constan?a (Rita Salema), o Professor Nuno (Carlos Vieira) o Professor Durval (Luís Gaspar), Rafa (Rodrigo Saraiva), Zé Milho (Vítor Fonseca), Topê (Paulo Vintém), Tojó (Diogo Valsassina) e Crómio (Tiago Castro). Entre o elenco infantil, as personagens com maior dura??o foram Susana (Carolina Castelinho), Dani (Diogo Martins) e Patrícia (Núria Real).<br>  <br>  Pipo (Jo?o Catarré) e Joana (Benedita Pereira), o casal protagonista da 1a Série, foi o único casal protagonista que continuou a aparecer como personagens secundários durante a 2a Série, visto que as suas personagens n?o seguiram para a Universidade.<br>  <br>  As personagens de Afonso (Francisco C?rte-Real) e Tomé (Fernando Fernandes) reapareceram por breves instantes numa história da 4a Série em que a sua m?e e tia Maria José (Ana Zanatti) foi atropelada. No fim das férias de Natal, Crómio (Tiago Castro), Daniela (Marta Faial) e Mimi (Jessica Athayde) regressam também numa breve participa??o. A personagem Marina (Sylvie Dias) da Primeira Série regressa à Quarta Série para integrar o elenco fixo.<br>  <br>  Participa??es Especiais<br>  Ao longo da Série I e das primeiras Férias de Ver?o, existiram algumas participa??es especiais de artistas internacionais e nacionais, como as Sugababes, EZ Special, Fingertips, Anjos, Nuno Gomes, os Reamonn, Simply Red, Daniel Bedingfield e Marie Serneholt. No último episódio da Série II, Pimpinha Jardim também fez uma participa??o especial gravada na Baixa da Banheira ao oferecer a Rodas (Tiago Aldeia) uma boleia para o Algarve. Paula Teixeira e Greg Minaar fizeram participa??es especiais durante a Série III. Jo?o Moutinho, jogador do Sporting também participou na série enquanto rosto publicitário da Sumol. Na passagem de ano a banda Asher Lane actuou no Bar Azul com a música da banda sonora "New Days". Carlos Andrade, jogador de basquetebol do Benfica participou recentemente na série.<br>  <br>  <br>  Curiosidades<br>  O falecimento do actor Francisco Adam (Dino), a 16 de Abril de 2006, eliminou for?osamente a sua personagem, o que até p?s em risco a continuidade da série. No entanto os responsáveis pelos "Morangos com A?úcar" foram rápidos em afirmar que a série iria continuar e decidiram de imediato o final que dariam a Dino, com este a partir num bal?o enquanto Susana (Diana Chaves) e o restante elenco se despedem dele vestidos de cor-de-laranja, a cor preferida do actor. Depois deste episódio, a personagem de Dino nunca mais foi mencionada pelo seu nome, por respeito ao actor, e Francisco Adam foi retirado do genérico para dar lugar a novas imagens de Francisco C?rte-Real (Afonso). <br>  As grava??es foram interrompidas temporariamente para luto dos actores e da equipa, provocando um atraso nas grava??es dos episódios e for?ando o elenco a fazer horas extraordinárias, incluindo fins-de-semana e feriados, para conseguir terminar o terceiro ano a tempo. O rumor de que Diana Chaves, que interpretava a apaixonada de Dino, iria abandonar a série foi desmentido pelo jornal 24 Horas. <br>  Em Janeiro de 2006, Rita Pereira, a "Soraia" de "Morangos Com A?úcar - Série II" foi internada no hospital da CUF em Lisboa, por causa de uma infec??o nas vias respiratórias. Rita Pereira é actualmente a "Estrelinha" de "Doce Fugitiva" e interrompeu as grava??es por uns dias, recome?ando dia 24 de Janeiro. <br>  Vários actores lan?ados nesta série est?o agora em outras novelas de sucesso da TVI: <br>  Em Ilha dos Amores estar?o: Joana Solnado, Cláudia Vieira, Mafalda Pinto, Ana Rita Trist?o, Joana Duarte, Diana Chaves, Jessica Athayde, Daniel Cardoso, Jo?o Pedro Sousa, Hugo Tavares e Diogo Valsassina. <br>  Em Tu e Eu est?o: Tiago Aldeia, Francisco C?rte-Real e Marta Melro <br>  Em Doce Fugitiva est?o: Rita Pereira, Helena Costa, Rúben Gomes, Oceana Basílio, Mariana Monteiro, Vítor Fonseca, Rita Ruaz e Sofia Arruda. <br>  Em Tempo de Viver est?o Benedita Pereira, Pedro Teixeira, Joana Solnado, Mafalda Pinto, Dania Neto, Hugo Tavares e Ana Guiomar. <br>  Em Fala-me de Amor estiveram: Cláudia Vieira, José Mata, Jo?o Pedro Sousa e Inês Sim?es. <br>  Em Dei-te Quase Tudo estiveram: Rita Pereira, Hélio Pestana, Marta Melro e Olga Diegues <br>  Em Mundo Meu estiveram Jo?o Catarré, Diogo Amaral, Patrícia Candoso, Dania Neto, Filomena Cautela e Olga Diegues. <br>  Em Ninguém Como Tu estiveram: Benedita Pereira e Liliana Santos. <br>  Em Inspector Max estiveram: Filomena Cautela, Liliana Santos, Matilde Breyner, Mafalda Pinto, Tiago Aldeia, José Mata, Raul Abrantes e Pedro Teixeira. <br>  <br>  No Brasil<br>  A Rede Bandeirantes, por meio de um acordo com a TVI, exibiu a primeira série de Morangos com A?úcar em meados de 2003 juntamente com a novela Olhos de água, ambas, curiosamente, dobradas em português brasileiro. Só que, ao contrário de Portugal, n?o teve muito sucesso e Morangos com A?úcar foi retirada do ar ao fim de pouco mais de três meses de exibi??o. <br>  Em Agosto de 2006, Diana Chaves (Susana), Francisco C?rte-Real (Afonso), Oceana Basílio (Carla), Ruben Gomes (Diogo) e Daniel Cardoso (Guga) foram para o Brasil filmar os finais das suas personagens. Em 2004, Jo?o Catarré (Pipo) e Benedita Pereira (Joana) também gravaram várias cenas no Brasil. <br>  RTP em conjunto com a Rede Bandeirantes produziu a novela Paix?es Proibidas onde no elenco está Carlos Vieira (Professor Nuno), que numa entrevista revelou que já n?o se lembrava da sua participa??o em "Morangos Com A?úcar". <br>  <br>  Música<br>  Morangos com A?úcar é uma série que dá imensa importancia à música, por conseguinte, a série tem funcionado como rampa de lan?amento para alguns dos vários actores que integram a história. Patrícia Candoso (Sara) e a boy band D'ZRT (David, Zé Milho, Topê e Ruca) s?o exemplos de actores que seguiram a carreira musical depois de terem entrado na série. Apesar da mistura entre realidade e fic??o, as carreiras de ambos foram lan?adas na série e bem recebidas pelo público. Na Série III, o actor e cantor Fernando Fernandes ou FF, encarnou a personagem Tomé e já lan?ou o seu primeiro álbum de originais. Também os quatro jovens músicos Francisco Jorge, Nelson Patr?o, David Gama e Luke D'E?a (Jota, Link, Sérgio e Ed, respectivamente) formaram depois de algumas peripécias a banda pop rock 4Taste.<br>  <br>  Os CDs com a banda sonora das três séries e de ambas as séries de Ver?o s?o já discos de múltipla platina. O primeiro álbum dos D'ZRT, intitulado D'ZRT, esteve no top de vendas nacional durante várias semanas. Após uma digress?o por todo o país em 2005, a banda lan?ou o seu segundo álbum (Original) no início de Junho de 2006, na praia de Santo Amaro de Oeiras.<br>  <br>  Em 2005 foi ainda lan?ado o CD Morang'Ice, com o nome da bebida que popularizou o Bar Tutti-Frutti das Férias de Ver?o - Série II. Este CD contém as músicas preferidas dos actores principais da série. Também no álbum Planeta Pop e Mundo da Fantasia est?o incluídas as músicas preferidas de alguns actores da série Cláudia Vieira (Ana Luísa), Pedro Teixeira (Sim?o), Rita Viegas (Vicky) e Rodrigo Menezes (Gil).<br>  <br>  Tiago Castro (Crómio), Diogo Valsassina (Tojó Rochinha) e Raul Abrantes (Jo?o Batista), lan?aram a 17 de Julho de 2006 o CD "A Minha Rádio", que contém a música "Baby, eu fiz este som". O respectivo videoclip conta com a participa??o especial da Marta Faial ("Daniela" dos Morangos).

9e1034dfe30e16dcce0c37f56f8f33e5aa	Sin?nimo de felicidade, é fazer o que se quer e ninguém tem nada a ver com isso! Que vergonha! A pouco respondi a uma pergunta de arrepiar pelo de porco. <br>  Pergunta: Porque é errado fazer amor com animais?<br>  Leia a resposta. <br>  Em partes fa?o minhas as palavras do Hyerominus e da Sara e até as do Lince. gosto de mulher também, principalmente da minha, as outras s?o as outras e também à elas sou indiferente, como com os homossexuais.<br>  Gra?as a Deus n?o tenho amigos gays, todos s?o héteros, casado(a)s ou solteiro(a)s. Sou crist?o, e n?o sou conivente com essas aberra??es que dizem ser liberdade de express?o e que tenho que respeitar por for?a da lei que me punirá se eu me atrever a achar feio homem se esfregar com homem.<br>  Certa vez, lembro-me bem disso, recebi um e-mail, tipo spam, tipo n?o, era spam, de uma propaganda com gays, dizendo que eu estava recebendo aquele licho com a complacência da lei fulana de tal. Mandei para o inferno o tal e-mail como quem enviou.<br>  No dia em que Deus se manifestar, quero ver como se portar?o diante Dele toda essa ra?a cor-de-rosas.<br>  Mas que fique claro: n?o concordo, discordo, n?o aceito, mas n?o ataco nas ruas ou fa?o piadas com quem é entendido no assunto. A lei é suprema e soberana, até que se prove o contrário! Até que tudo seja manifestado, vivo a minha vida ao lado da mulher mais linda do mundo (pra mim ela é, com certeza, e porquem sou bob?o e perdidamente apaixonado). Como crist?o, um seguidor de Cristo, n?o fanático religioso, porque isso é outra porcaria que n?o serve para nada, só para atrapalhar e n?o apenas um que acredita em Deus, vou pregar o evangelho a essas pessoas, que de desvio psicológico n?o tem nada, mas s?o pessoas iludidas e enganadas e usurpadas, com o objetivo de que caiam na real e vejam o engano sedutor em que vivem.<br>  Essa é minha posi??o, opini?o e o que mais seja necessário aqui para manifestar-me.<br>  <br>  Boa noite a todos!|`|045169670673ac02c0e86c43c145671aaa	minha posi??o é de quatro.<br>  <br>  <br>  ta, falando sério, eu n?o tenho nada contra, bem pelo contrário, acho legal.|`|BlRlZp5Eaa	Eu só gosto de mulheres, essa é a minha posi??o.

Nove entre dez feias têm amigas bonitas. E essa que sobra tem sempre uma prima.<br>  <br>  é emocionante. Você vai se sentir o próprio 007 tentando escondê-la dos seus amigos.<br>  <br>  é seguro. Você pode parar o carro num local ermo e, dependendo do calibre da mulher que estiver te acompanhando, os ladr?es n?o v?o te incomodar, com medo de serem comidos vivos.<br>  <br>  é mais fácil. Uma feia normalmente n?o escolhe muito as companhias masculinas, por for?a da lei de oferta e procura. Logo, mesmo sendo muito feio a chance de levar um fora é mínima. <br>  é econ?mico. Ela sabe que n?o é a mais bela das mulheres e n?o vai ficar exigindo jantares caros ou presentes constantes.<br>  <br>  é um excelente parametro. Vai aprender a determinar qual a beleza das mulheres com uma rápida olhada, depois de praticar tanto com seus namoros.<br>  <br>  é um ato de caridade. Você se sente melhor quando sai com uma delas. é a sua boa a??o da semana. O problema é virar hábito e você fundar a "Casa de Auxílio às Menos Bonitas".<br>  <br>  é interessante. Pode ser que a feiosa tenha um milh?o de cabe?as de gado. E você n?o tem a menor voca??o para "ficar pra titio" pobre.<br>  <br>  é um ato que colabora com seus estudos. Uma feia sempre copia tudo o que o professor fala na aula, o que facilita em muito na hora de tirar cópias da matéria.<br>  <br>  é um ato que melhora suas notas. Na hora da "cola", lembre que antes de nascer, toda mulher opta entre inteligência ou beleza.<br>  <br>  é suficiente em casos desesperados. Na pior das hipóteses, mas na pior mesmo, gol de bico também tira um zero do placar.<br>  <br>  "Quem ama o feio, bonito lhe parece", diz o ditado popular. "N?o existem mulheres feias, existem mal-amadas", diz o poeta. "Beleza está dentro de quem vê", diz você. S?o desculpas para serem utilizadas quando for gozado pelos seus amigos.|`|OlV9OG3Iaa	Veja essa ent?o:<br>  Num ?nibus que passava por Minas, com destino ao Rio de Janeiro, entrou um caipira com três porcos a tira-colo.

No Domingo legal o que salva s?o os quadros de utilidade pública, que ajudam as pessoas à voltar para o Estado de origem ou encontrar pessoas desaparecidas, o Quer casar comigo de novo é meio chato. No Doming?o do Faust?o o que salva é a Dan?a dos Famosos e os cantores. Agora eles pararam com o sertanejo um pouco. Adoro música sertaneja mas antes eram as principais duplas todo domingo e ainda em revesamento com o Gugu. Quando aparecia no Faust?o num domingo no outro era no Gugu e sempre as mesmas, aquelas que todo mundo sabe quem s?o. No caso das entrevistas, o Faust?o é péssimo. Com tantos anos de experiência em televis?o e com um programa caduco de t?o velho no ar, ele n?o perde aquela mania horrível de interromper o convidado e responder as perguntas por ele. Tudo bem que em TV o tempo seja muito cronometrado e reduzido mas, existem formas mais educadas de finalizar uma conversa, uma entrevista sem ser intrometido e grosseiro e ele ainda usa a rídícula desculpa que o programa é ao vivo. Ele saiu do "Perdidos na noite" mas, o "Perdidos na noite" n?o saiu dele.

Enfim, somos até discriminado por saber ou até mesmo no interessar por um assunto. Por exemplo, sou discriminada na sala por gostar da disciplina História da Ciência, quando estou falando ou?o coisa como "é a sabedoria em pessoa que está falando" termos como estes que preconizam sua integridade intelectual.

Hoje em dia tenho quase 16 e estou tentando me recuperar de uma bulimia. <br>  Dizem que as criancinhas n?o s?o más e que se gozam os colegas é por brincadeirinha... n?o por maldade...

Mas, de forma genérica, para pessoas nascidas no Brasil, pode-se adotar a seguinte tabela: se você nasceu entre seis e oito horas da manh? seu ascente é o próprio signo. Se nasceu entre oito e dez horas da manh?, é o seguinte: entre 10 e 12 horas, o próximo. Para descobrir facilmente o seu, olhe o desenho e siga este exemplo. O signo da pessoa que usamos para exemplificar foi Le?o e o horário de nascimento 22H45. Portanto o signo ascendente é o que ficar na casa entre 22 e 24 horas, ou seja, o ascendente é áries. Copie este procedimento colocando seu signo na casa das 6 às 8 horas e complete as outras casas com os signos seguintes, de maneira que o signo anterior ao seu caia na casa das 4 às 6 horas. Depois, olhe a casa do horário do seu nascimento. O signo que estiver nela é o seu ascendente.<br>  <br>  Mapa de ascendentes <a href="http://www.shoppingaleria.com.br/defsig.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.shoppingaleria.com.br/defsig....</a>

A família Sardinha e o atores Ney Latorraca e Maytê Proen?a deram um verdadeiro show, isso sem contar o Mateus (Helinho) que se superou, pois seu personagem poderia ser melhor aproveitado, afinal ele é um ator ótimo.

Por essas três fases, passaram os melhores atores. Vamos listar alguns: Samara Felippo, Fernanda Rodrigues, Danton, Marjorie, Fernanda Nobre, Lília Cabral, Roger Gobeth, Nair Bello (até ela!), Tássia Camargo... O resto é tudo enche??o de lingüi?a, uma série interminável de péssimos "atores" iniciantes e bons veteranos mal aproveitados, e a repeti??o de histórias que vêm desde sempre. <br>  Por mim, ou acaba a Malha??o, ou reprisa uma dessas três fases, ou passa mais uma novela antiga, que vale mais a pena.

Por causa da professora Helena, é claro!), mas a melhor de todas, com certeza, foi "Vamp", de 1991, que mais parecia um filme do que uma novela. E só pra se ter uma idéia de como isso é verdade, os efeitos especiais das transforma??es e mortes dos vampiros foram feitos pela mesma equipe que fez os efeitos do filme "A Hora do Espanto", um dos maiores clássicos dos filmes de terror dos anos 80! Só a Globo mesmo, hein? Sem falar que a história tanto era engra?ada, cheia de a??o, mistério e romance, como o elenco, sem exce??o, foi o melhor que já se reuniu numa novela, a come?ar por Claudia Ohana, como a Vampira do Rock "Natasha" e Ney Latorraca, como o vampir?o "Vlad".

As horas passando, chegando a hora de eu ir embora e ele lá sentado conversando. Ah! a luz da sala estava apagada só a TV estava ligada. O jeito é eu tentar vestir as cal?as com ele aqui mesmo. <br>  Minha namorada nem respirava de t?o tensa. Dai eu come?ei a puxar a cal?a pra cima devagarinho, devagarinho até que consegui. Antes de eu terminar a m?e dela acordou e disse: Você ainda está ai? Eu falei: é é que seu fulano chegou e a gente nem viu a hora passar, mas já estou indo. Nisso a cal?a ainda n?o estava em cima. Dai minha namorada, que sabia que eu n?o tinha terminado, falou: Fica mais um pouquinho! Eu falei: só até terminar o filme.<br>  Quando eu abotoei as cal?as, foi uma emo??o t?o boa que ninguém imagina.<br>  Fala sério: é ou n?o é emocionante?<br>  Eu sei que você nem vai acreditar, mas pensa que eu aprendi?

O pisciano sempre estará envolvido com seus sonhos, distante da realidade, e n?o se importa muito se vive rodeado de amigos ou se passa a maior parte do tempo sozinho. Já o leonino prefere a agita??o, gosta de estar cercado de pessoas, e se irrita com ar etéreo do pisciano, apesar de saber o encanto que exerce sobre o outro. Afinal, n?o se há ... está com erro....|`|Ge32WVVfaa	LE?O X PEIXES=<br>  <br>  <br>  Le?o será o líder no relacionamento, sendo assim que tudo sai melhor, para ambos os lados. No fundo, Peixes prefere ser dominado, desde que com afei??o, como quase sempre acontece em se tratando de Le?o. Dá pra entender: sermos dominados torna a vida mais fácil.<br>  <br>  Outra pessoa dirá ao pisciano o que fazer, com isso deixando tempo de sobra para os devaneios netunianos e menos para as decis?es obrigatórias de responsabilidade. Estes dois n?o s?o naturalmente compatíveis e devem trabalhar pela harmonia. Le?o se sente à vontade num habitat selvagem, quente e seco; Peixes, em águas frias e sombreadas. Há diferen?as básicas consideráveis, devendo um deles abdicar do ambiente familiar, simbolicamente falando, para que permane?am juntos.<br>  <br>  Quando em qualquer tipo de contato diário com Le?o, Peixes deverá ter sempre em mente que a aprecia??o sincera (o elogio) abrandará o animal selvagem mais depressa do que amuos, lágrimas ou o silêncio. Le?o n?o deveria esquecer que a delicadeza é a isca mais segura para atrair o pisciano sensível e que seus régios rugidos apenas fazem o pisciano agitar as barbatanas.<br>  <br>  N?o será difícil a estes dois ajustarem-se um ao outro e encontrarem a felicidade se ambos mostrarem seus lados positivos em vez dos negativos.|`|ULEUvQpvaa	O leonino está sempre t?o concentrado em si mesmo que n?o tem muitas oportunidades para contatos telepáticos. Esta seria, talvez, uma saída para diminuir seus desencontros com o pisciano - contatos imediatos de terceiro grau, já que nos contatos do dia-a-dia eles v?o se estranhar. Peixes vai achar o le?o um insensível - ele é, sim, mas só por distra??o. Le?o vai achar seu peixes um chato de galochas, que fica se lamentando pelos cantos - ele é, sim, quando n?o lhe d?o bola. Os mal-entendidos se dissipar?o no dia em que eles notarem o quanto s?o dedicados um ao outro. <br>  <br>  <br>  Nao fique triste qnd ler essa resposta, é o que os astros dizem.|`|ae1fe87dbf161377208f755833a8d3e1aa	Se os dois se amam, sim.<br>  O que importa é o que sentem um pelo outro e n?o o sígno. <br>  bjs|`|jfMypnuyaa	Olha...<br>  Signo de le?o, eh mto briguento, quando fik bravo, sai d prto, pq vai "explodir".

Alguns minutos antes de ler sua pergunta, estava justamente pensando nos motivos pelos quais n?o existem realy shows educativos (tipo uma gincana de conhecimentos ou coisa do gênero); por que tem que ser na base das pessoas com pouca roupa e muita vulgaridade, ou arriscando a vida, ou sendo expostas ao ridículo? Eu n?o consigo entender o que leva alguém a assistir um programa onde mulheres seminuas tentam seduzir homens sarad?es, fingindo n?o saber que aquilo tudo é uma arma??o e desde o início existe um script que só muda de acordo com a audiência e a vota??o que cada candidato recebe; na Net, abriram um canal em pay-per-view (pago à parte) só para os tarados de plant?o terem acesso à cameras exclusivas colocadas nos quartos e no banheiro - dá para entender?

Na minha cidade, existem agentes de saúde que entram em becos que nem a polícia encara e lá eles fazem acompanhamento de gestantes e recém-nascidos, dando atendimento básico de saúde a todos e orientando sobre controle de natalidade e preven??o de DST - eu só fiquei sabendo do programa há poucos dias atrás, porque n?o é divulgado; imagino que em cidades como Rio e S?o Paulo exista um número infinitamente maior de pessoas trabalhando pelo bem estar do próximo, seja através de programas do governo ou como voluntárias, pessoas an?nimas que fazem a diferen?a... E aí eu me pergunto (assim como você): por que promover o que nada acrescenta, o que é vulgar, o que é de última categoria? Por que insistir em manter o povo na mediocridade e no aculturamento, quando poderiam ter acesso, através da televis?o, à uma cultura sadia e à no??es de solidariedade e amor ao próximo? Só posso dizer que tais atitudes partem de pessoas que fazem quest?o de manter o país no 3o mundo, longe de tudo que possa provocar a emancipa??o das pessoas como cidad?s e como seres humanos.|`|e5b5b146e6671a754d41f1325aa1f49caa	Por causa do apelo que se cria em torno destes programas.

Por isso a deixei de assistir assim que vi a cena ridicula em que a Anna descobriu a trai??o de seus rico marido com a advogada. Infelismente a Rede Globo está deixando a desejar muito no quesito novela, seria bem melhor se apresentasse somente jornalismo durante 24 horas por dia. O povo estaria muito mais feliz, afinal de contas fo i- se o tempo em que a vida imitava a arte pois apesar de tanta violencia no Brasil e no mundo, nao estamos precisando ver isso também nas novelas, ninguém precisa saber como ser uma prostituta ou roubar o marido, namorado, patr?o ou seja lá quem for. Uma novela que ao meu ver ainda n?o sabe aonde vai chegar, nem qual  o seu proposito  ou finalidade. O autor no meu ver está mais perdido que cego em tiroteio.|`|XIMbc5g7aa	Sou mais as novelas da Record ou  do SBT onde existem artista quase que desconhecidos ou que est?o menos em evidência na mídia mas que d?o banho de representa??o, e também os autores que para mim est?o também  muito mais preocupados em trazer uma proposta de lazer muito mais saudável e agradável de se assistir do que essa coisa repetitiva da Globo em todas as novelas só muda os artistas mas a história é sempre a mesma, onde o foco principal é incentivar e ensinar com virar uma prostituta, como tomar o marido da outra e vice versa, encucando na cabe?a de milhares de brasileiros, muitos deles adolescentes, vulneráveis a todo tipo de influência, que n?o tem condi??es financeiras para ir ao cinema de vez em quando, que tudo é normal, que nada é absoluto, tudo é relativo, que o certo é errado e o errado é certo.<br>  Sou m?e de família e aconselho os pais n?o deixarem seus filhos adolescentes assistirem esses lixos que s?o as novelas da Globo.|`|a0207c6d855428dd2419c075887c2efaaa	A novela mostra a realidade, a vida como ela é.<br>  Gente sempre querendo tirar proveito da situa??o e das pessoas, levando em considera??o somente seu objetivo: subir na vida a qquer. pre?o.<br>  Vivemos isso hoje.<br>  Olavo,  Antenor, Jader, Thaís... est?o todos os dias nos telejornais envolvidos em escandalos, CPIs, máfia... <br>  Assistimos a isso hondiernamente.

A novela só se preocupa em mostrar o sexo livre e depois se acha no direito de reclamar da prostitui??o, mas é isso que eles acabam vendendo. Quer tirar a dúvida: me responda como come?ou o capítulo do dia 05 ou 06/06/2007, agora n?o lembro a data certa. Mas foi com uma cena de sexo quase explícito entre o guriz?o de cueca e a gêmea da menina boazinha.

Jamelia ain't bad either. Also Corinne Bailey Rae is making waves for all apparent and pleasurable reasons. Norah Jones was and is and will  always be a darl.  I also chanced upon an old compilation  Sixpence, None the richer By some Divine Detention or something. That wasn't bad at all. <br>  Also I do like listening to Seal. Michelle Branch is soothing. Chris Daughtry did some good rock and alternative numbers and was a good change. Also Maroon 5 with their latest album were good. <br>  I also quiet like Keane. Wonderful raspy vocals. There were also some songs from OST of Step UP that were not so bad. I also like Bird York for some easy listening. Lily Allen is good too as a break from others. You can also try 'Kings of convenience'. Michael Buble is so so.<br>  REM is loved still together with the Carpenters. Heart does go sha la la la with them every time I hear them. <br>  So that is superficially as much as I could put down. So much mroe but this is a good mix for you to try.<br>  KAPISH !|`|AA11581770	Ah! I love your music list.

Além de que eu n?o acho que signo atrapalhe alguma coisa na vida da pessoa.<br>  <br>  Só deve atrapalhar para quem já colocou isso na cabe?a, que Sargitário com Cancêr n?o combinam, pois a pessoa faz com que o pensamento negativo dela acabe atrapalhando o namoro ou a paquera.|`|f0a53974057e2ebe44b3874202d53fe7aa	Você por acaso pensa em acabar o namoro por causa disso???

Portanto, nunca vi nada dá certo pra um monte de gente q esteja relacionado a horóscopo. Portanto, acho mais viável viver a vida numa normalidade e sem se preocupar com esse negócio, a aparentemente s?o pessoas q ganham a vida escrevendo isso e como quase todo ser humano é curioso, lê e na maioria das vezes ficam impressionados, pensando q tudo aquilo vai acontecer. Se coincidir algo q disse no horóscopo, aí acredita e agarra essa idéia com for?a.|`|fe1503af8d12de2660fe0b7dabb5e013aa	Voce acredita em horoscopo?|`|7BSRkJ0raa	sim mas cuidado|`|By9tuMjSaa	Cancer & Sagitário<br>  <br>  No princípio, esta rela??o tende a ser mais regada a conven??es do que a uma real paix?o entre ambos. Cancerianos gostam de viajar e descobrir novos rumos, fazer caminhos diferentes do convencional e descobrir?o, nos sagitarianos, ótimos companheiros. Esta rela??o será certamente mais convencional, sem muitos altos e baixos, e ambos sentir?o falta de uma paix?o mais arrebatadora, principalmente o sagitariano, que vive mergulhado em seus sentimentos e gosta de poder doar parte do seu tempo e esfor?o para a pessoa amada.<br>  <br>  Esta uni?o n?o é muito duradoura porque provavelmente haverá falta de entrosamento e de entrega de ambos, que tendem a se acomodar um pouco quando a situa??o n?o está nem ruim, nem boa. Se partirem de um ideal comum, pode ser que fiquem mais tempo juntos.|`|az9DTXuGaa	existem outras coisas que influenciam, como o signo lunar, vênus no mapa astral de vocês dois, isso conta mais do que os signos solares (cancer e sagitário)|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	os signos nao influenciam de uma pessoa gostar da outra.

Crian?as e pessoas que n?o podem ter emo??es fortes (cardíacos, pessoas com transtornos psicológicos) est?o acordadas e têm as novelas para se distraírem à noite. Tá certo que os pais devem controlar o que as crian?as assistem, o que n?o quer dizer que a TV possa colocar qualquer coisa na hora em que quiser - fazer apela??o e sensacionalismo, só pra conseguir uns pontos a mais na audiência. Isso deseduca a crian?a. O pior de tudo isso é ver essas novelas de Carlos Lombardi com homens e mulheres sem roupa, e uma hora depois ver programas educativos como SuperNanny e Floribella (que já acabou, mas merece ser citada), o que só confunde ainda mais quem assiste. Sem falar que vai come?ar uma novela na Record que vai falar de crian?as e jovens com poderes. Essa novela vai entrar no lugar de Vidas opostas (novela que fala do tráfico de drogas e da violência) às 10 da noite!<br>  <br>  O problema da promiscuidade é generalizado. Vem da necessidade de ter pontos no Ibope - o que é mais dinheiro pros donos da emissora - sem pensar no que está oferecendo pra quem está em casa.<br>  <br>  Só de pensar que há 20 anos atrás tínhamos novelas das 7 mais sadias e engra?adas. Os tempos de Victor Valentin e Tina Pepper já passaram. Hoje temos Marcos Pasquim sem roupa e gente superficial como Sabrina Sato, Siri e Alem?o "roubando a cena" na TV.<br>  <br>  Fui!|`|U8Nnh9pVaa	N?o chamaria de promiscuidade, mas falta de valores éticos e morais. A presen?a constante de cenas de sexo (quase explícito) invadindo nossa privacidade n?o é agradável. Por mais que seja um comportamento humano, mas é desconfortável você estar junto dos pais ou filhos e uma cena mais ousada aparece. Respeito é algo que meus pais me ensinaram e prezo muito isto. Há pouco tempo tínhamos um comportamento semelhante na música quando grupos musicais apresentavam dan?arinas em movimentos sensuais. Particularmente achava muito vulgar estas dan?as, entendo perfeitamente que eram dan?arinas (pelo menos se diziam) profissionais e que aquilo ali era seu trabalho. Mas ver uma crian?a dan?ando a Dan?a da Bundinha, da Garrafinha n?o era nada engra?ado.<br>  As novelas tem sua importancia cultural, tanto quanto qualquer programa??o. Podemos limitar esta promiscuidade mudando de canal, desligando a televis?o e ainda conversar sobre estas cenas com nossa família.<br>  Respeito é bom e todo mundo gosta. Porém situa??es como esta s?o necessárias, porque nos permitem optar por coisas mais saudáveis.<br>  Jads|`|Y2ZWwtCaaa	A rede globo incentiva a invers?o dos valores familiares 24 horas por dia na sua programa??o.<br>  <br>  Lembra de Tieta? Onde tinha pedofilia e incesto?<br>  <br>  Leiam um artigo interessante que encontrei no site www.cacp.org.br<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  CELEBRIDADES DO MAL... <br>  por Alexandre Farias<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Jo?o 10v.10 – “ O ladr?o veio para matar , roubar e destruir ......”<br>  <br>  Muitos fazem cara feia  quando o pastor fala sobre as novelas , mas contra fatos n?o existem argumentos .O que os escritores das ditas novelas deveriam fazer é colocar  acontecimentos do dia- dia sem estar levando o adultério como saída de um casamento problemático, sexo antes do casamento como algo normal e sadio , a rela??o de garotas e garotos do mesmo sexo  , enfim ,  problemas que s?o visíveis à sociedade, mas deveriam ser combatidos e n?o absorvidos como algo normal e bom .<br>  <br>  Na vida real  nos deparamos  com o sexo antes do casamento  e por causa disto  adolescentes grávidas a ponto de deixar a sua vida normal para cuidar de uma crian?a , a frase certa é “ uma crian?a cuidando da outra , avó sendo m?e novamente”. Será que você que está lendo está matéria n?o  lembra  da Jade ? Deixa-me perguntar : Para quem você torceu para ficar com ela ? O seu marido ou o “Lucas” ? <br>  <br>  Ent?o se você torceu pelo Lucas , veja qual é a sua opini?o sobre o adultério ! N?o foi isto que aconteceu ? Sempre me preocupo em troca de valores , as novelas poderiam ser mais importantes quando ela mostra a luta de um casal contra a  enfermidade,mas o marido estando ao lado da esposa até o fim. A busca do filho custe o que custar para tirá-lo  das drogas , o sacrifício de um trabalhador para sustentar o seu filho na escola , passando a faculdade e por fim se formando. Eu sei que existem situa??es como estas em algumas novelas   , mas quem n?o se lembra de éramos Seis , Meu pé de Laranja Lima que a família inteira assistia sem a preocupa??o de ter o controle remoto nas m?os para tirar de qualquer cena pornográfica ! Precisamos de pessoas que escrevam as verdadeiras novelas da vida sem pornografia .Se n?o existir uma cena erótica parece que a novela n?o da ibope . Bem esta n?o é uma matéria sobre novelas  , por isso  n?o vou entrar a fundo no assunto , mas quem sabe  em breve teremos uma . O que eu quero que vocês analisem é :<br>  <br>  -         Como eu posso  assistir aos novela que tenha  Lúcifer se apresentando ?<br>  <br>  - Qual  é o conteúdo da novela ? <br>  <br>  -         Você sabia que a novela Celebridade está com uma musica que apresenta Lúcifer ?<br>  <br>  A musica é de  Mick Jagger  que se inspirou no romance “ The máster and the<br>  <br>  margarita”, do autor russo Mikhail Bulgakov , em que o diabo se apresenta  como “ <br>  <br>  Woland” , um professor alem?o de artes negras  para revirar a vida da sociedade russa. <br>  <br>  Mick Jagger canta na primeira <br>  <br>  Pessoa  a musica , encarnando “Sat?”  e reivindicando  fatos históricos . Fatos como execu??es , proclama Hittler , anuncia  a matan?a dos Kennedys . O fato deveria ser apurado pelo Ministério da Justi?a , porque diz que todo policial  é criminoso . Os Stones gravaram a musica depois de passar as férias no Brasil . A musica ressalta ainda mais  o satanismo de Rolling Stones , que em alguns álbuns já vazia men??es da Celebridade das trevas  como “ Their Satanic Majesties Request”. Um fato chama a aten??o , durante esta musica um espectador foi assassinado a facadas no festival de Altamont em dezembro de  1969 , Jagger  comentou que algo estranho sempre acontecia quando tocavam a can??o.<br>  <br>  No Brasil  o Lan?amento do Cd “Vooduu Longe”  trouxe o que falar , Jagger apareceu  encarnado como Lúcifer e na sua companhia  os bonecos infláveis  das trevas . O clipe está sendo gravado , a a??o central  é de um rapaz que encarna no meio do deserto Lúcifer e sai aprontando por todo o mundo . O diretor Alex Derakoft afirmou  ao site da MTV americana que fez o vídeo narrativo com a maior liberdade . Uma das declara??es  do diretor é esta : “ Foi muito empolgante para todos nós seguir este jovem diabo que sai explorando as fraquezas de cada um . O mundo é seu Play ground e ele faz todo mundo pagar um pre?o alto”.<br>  <br>  E você quer pagar este pre?o ?
