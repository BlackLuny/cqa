Luckily, a police officer was right behind me, and was able to push me off to the side. We got it home by way of towing. Now, there is no power circulation in the car; I turn the key and nothing happens. We attempted to charge the battery via jumper cables. I was able to start the car, but when he removed the cable, the car instantly died. What could be the problem?

When I start my car, the rpms like to jump from 600-800. If I give it some gas it starts to even out. But sometimes it goes back to the jumping. Also, sometimes when I'm in reverse or going forward and going at a low speed, below 5mph, the car hesitates like it does not want to go and then starts to go and it jerks a lot. What does my car need? I do not think it had any tune-ups at all and not that it matters, but my car sounds terrible when it's cold out, the timing belt sounds terrible. What needs to be done?

20090205134521AAoLmRb	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	A challenging question for any mechanic?	I have a GMC Sonoma 2.2 4 cyl. I have a hard one to answer it has stumped me and alot of mechanics even certified gm mechanics. The last 2 years every winter my truck hesitates while trying to advance speed or when I give it more rpms in every gear (stick shift). When it hesitates almost like its missing I can feel clunking. I have changed plugs and wires twice in 2 years, today I put 2 new coil packs on, I change my fuel filter 3 times a year, I did a fuel pressure check it was good, I put 2 new o2 sensors on, changed catalytic convertor, There is no check engine light on. When its real cold I cant or can barely start truck. When it was in the below weather I tried to start it so many times that I fried the starter ( 1 year old) I put a little starting fluid in and it blew my plastic in pieces that connects air filter and throttle body. I have not done a compression check. Sometimes when I am idling and revin it up the engine bogs out when its cold. Last winter it wasnt as bad but still a problem as soon as the weather got warm the truck was fine

It's extremely loud and obnoxious yet absolutely needed in all types of weather.    I called my mechanic and he said the car would need to be looked at before he could give an estimate because it could be a number of different things.   Could anyone tell me if it's simpler than that? Example: only would need one part to fix or if it's the entire fan system itself.... and could you also give a ballpark estimate before I get taken for a ride by my mechanic? Thank you!

20090205151857AABJowd	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Tire/Engine problem??? See Below?	I have a 2005 Chevy Avalanche with a 5.3l V-8. I have headers, high-flow Cats, Flowmaster 40 Series, and a cold air intake WITH the factory mass air flow. Well I had to buy new tires so instead of putting the same tires on it I bought mud all-terrain tires. So after I had them installed I noticed my engine was louder and my exhaust was quiter. It only has 43000 on it and at first my thought was that the factory mass-air flow sensor was hurting it. I also noticed when you floor the pedal that it takes longer to get up to 5500 rpms than when I had my bad tires on it. Now is this problem because of putting these tires on?
20090205140601AALoUPu	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Major Loss in Fuel Economy?	I am taking my 1997 Honda Del Sol in to the shop tomorrow, and I'm not sure exactly what I should ask them to do.... a tune-up, or look for a specific problem, or both?    I bought this car used at 90k miles. It was literally an old lady's car, had received every factory recommended maintenance on schedule, etc etc. Excellent condition when I bought it about 3 years ago.    I've got it up to 145k and until now it has had no problems. Aside from oil changes, brakes and exhaust work, it has not been in the shop and I have not given it any maintenance. I've also used those fuel injector cleaning additives once a year or so, but those don't seem to do anything.    Over the past few years the gas mileage has been slowly dropping, and now it's quite low compared to when I bought it. After the first year it stayed around 31 mpg, but in the past few months it has dropped more and now it's at about 25.    More symptoms: I can now smell gasoline, or maybe exhaust, the first time I start it for the day. Subsequent startings that day will normally have no gas odor. Also this winter the temperature gauge on the dashboard has been reading very low, barely above the lowest level, but the heater is nice and warm.    I made an appointment for tomorrow morning, assuming that I should get the car a tuneup and that would probably fix my problem. Now I'm having second thoughts though. Should I have them figure out the fuel economy issue before doing anything else? What should I ask for?
20090205154200AAzijJo	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Possible damage to truck?	I got this challenge from a friend to hook our two trucks together via the trailer hitches with a chain and see which one could pull the other around the parking lot.  But what I'm worried about is that is would trash the transmission and maybe do damage to the trailer hitch, would this indeed happen?  I know I can pull him all over the parking lot because I have a F250 with a Powerstroke and he only has a 150, but I'm worried about the damage to the truck that could happen since his parents wouldn't care that much if anything happened to his truck but mine would kill me if anything happened to my truck, so what is the likelihood that transmission and or trailer hitch damage could result, and is there anything else that could happen?      If it means anything the truck has an automatic transmission

N cap safety rating - It says that the 2006 Toyota Yaris has five stars. But this for the T3 model. The T3 has nine air bags.      There is also a 2006 Yaris that does not have these airbags. It is called the T2. What safety rating does the T2 Yaris have? And is there anywhere on the Ncap website I can find out?

20090205134620AABt0mi	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	Dodge Stratus question?	my best friend and I will be getting our driver's licenses on march 25th. he has this mid 90's dodge stratus that once belonged to his mom before she got tired of it overheating constantly and parked it in their backyard. his mom said that if he can get it fixed then he could have it. i love working on cars and mechanical stuff so my buddy asked me if i could help him fix the car and i said i would. from my understanding it just has overheating problems but still runs despite it's been sitting for the past year. im thinking that im just going to take a look at the thermostat, check the coolant level, see if the belt going to the water pump may be slipping, and of course look for leaks in the hoses, radiator, etc. so basically i have an idea of what im going to look for until i find the problem, but i have never worked on a dodge stratus before and i dont know if theres more to expect. so my question is if theres anything else you may be able to think of to troubleshoot the problem? i havent yet looked under the hood so im not sure if it has a V6 or a four banger. i just really want my buddy to be able to drive around as soon as he gets his license like i will be able to. thanks for your input everybody!

20090205153442AAiCe4W	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Why do some drivers need 1-car's space in front of them when behind other cars parked at lights?	When  a light is red, and a line of cars form at that intersection waiting for the green...      why do some drivers feel the need for such a huge buffer zone between them and the car in front of them? Some drivers create a whole cars' space in front of them when idling behind other cars. And sometimes even more than that.       Why do they do that?  And the drivers that do that... are they aware that they are creating a backlog behind them, causing cars who want to get into the Left turn lane... to have to wait in a logjammed line?    Are they aware that they have that effect and they don't care?  Or are they just unaware that they have that effect?
