Dummerweise verstehen die umstehendenden in dem Moment auch gar nichts davon (aber die kennen Dich nicht und deswegen solltest Du Dir nicht so viel Sorgen machen; vielleicht ist ja jemand mit einer Inkontinenzwindel dabei - sieht man ja nicht) und unangenehm ist es ja sowieso. Sch?n w?re dann, wenn das Auto nicht so weit weg ist (so man eines besitzt).

WaI693jHaa	WIthout some sort of hacker software I can't think of any way you could find out who has accessed your account.<br>  <br>  It may be a strange question but "it seems some of my new messages have already been opened" seems rather odd. What makes you think that? The only thing that would make me think that is if I found mails which showed up as grey rather than black, because unread messages show up in black ink. Since you can make a mail look as if it has never been read by simply clicking on "mark as unread" I can't imagine anyone reading your mails and leaving such an obvious clue.<br>  <br>  If that's the case I would definitely think about closing that account and starting up a new one because someone has cracked your account.

Especially the ones of abused animals, such as the one showing a starving dog (all bones poking out from everywhere  - the add reading "It takes 2 hours to poison a dog". I Realize it is done so as to alert awareness as to animal suffering and our own casual inhumanity...but every time I see it I wince and sometimes, simply break into tears, knowing fully well that what the ad means IS : It is 2-hours, unbelievably painful stomach pains time until the animal expires...wondering perhaps why the bit of food it had thought to have found toward sustenance, is hell on earth, once swallowed.<br>  These ads break my heart, I am sorry to say. It leaves me in a space of helplessness and horror as to us humans. There are so very many poor innocent creatures whose fate is to suffer, unless we take part in helping against such blatant unfairness. Lack of concern.<br>  THIS PARTICULAR AD I HAVE SPOKEN OF, says to me : "HERE, TAKE A GOOD LOOK IN THE MIRROR...FOR THIS DOG'S 2-HOURS' STOMACH PAINS HAVE JUST BECOME YOUR OWN HEART, IF IT REMAINS UNRESPONSIVE!"

zDQIPFH2aa	When this happens, there are two reasons:<br>  <br>  1. (least likely) there is a random glitch now and then that just loses the Qs. YA Staff do not care, just delete the old version and reask. If it was a long question with links, ask it in a short version with no links, then finish the question with the links in the added details.<br>  <br>  2. (more likely) you were caught by the prefilter. Exactly how it works is not known, but probably is based on keywords and links you use (to prevent spamming). These questions are held for the YA Staff to review. It is usually for hours during the week, but can be days on weekends and holidays. Again, if you follow the direction in #1 above, you can sometimes get around it.<br>  <br>  To test all this, just post the question in as short a form as you can word it with no suspect (sexual, cursing, etc) words.  Put no addition details or links of any kind.  Get it posted and then add the meat of the question in the Additional Details.|`|SvsDQ0poaa	No, sometimes either because some word in the question activated the auto-filters or sometimes there are system glitches.  I recommend that if after 1 hour, the Q still doesn't post, simply delete it on your own (sometimes I've gotten penalties on top of the q not posting).|`|bXRuC1ASaa	I hope not!

What does annoy me is when you have typed war and peace as an answer, click submit, and the question has been deleted.  Until I read your question I did not realise that the asker could possibly have deleted the question I always assumed it had been reported for some reason and Yahoo had deleted it, you live and learn very day thanks for that.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Haha, yeah!  What really "gets my goat" is when they pick the one that caters to the response they wanted, but isn't necessarily correct!  And they thumbs down you for telling them they are doing the wrong thing, or can't really do what they want to.|`|BZMPax7Naa	No|`|sC09VfIsaa	doesn't bother me to be honest|`|jhdpLhNcaa	It's not that much important not to be selected as a best answerer. I don't deny that it makes me happy when I'm selected. But it has happened to me several times that I was answering a question and when I clicked the submit I found out the questions was deleted. It's kind of annoying.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	No.  Sometimes my answer isn't the best answer.  Sometimes there is an equally good answer, and most of the time, I don't pay too much attention after I have given an answer.|`|sQqGpRXtaa	Not normally, but there was a situation where somebody asked for the translation of a word into German. Being German I gave an answer but the asker chose a totally wrong answer as best answer. I was totally mystified.|`|gSUU3Tk3aa	No. That's something a 7 year old would do. There's no need to throw a temper tantrum just because you did "all that" research. There are about 1,000 open questions out there.|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	Yes, I'm a bit annoyed. You've done some research and spent time trying to answer it and they didn't even choose you or just picked a random answer.|`|mVUpt8waaa	No but I do get pissed off when I get thumbs down just because I give an answer that the asker doesnt want to hear.|`|colhXvWDaa	Nop, not as long as the best answer really deserved it. Sometimes I get mad though.|`|GUuFKaaiaa	no not really<br>  BUT U BETTER CHOOSE ME AS BEST ANSWER !!!!|`|CrmCHVI0aa	not really|`|LIxpXTnLaa	can it, moron<br>  <br>  does that answer your question?|`|SOxdyWQOaa	sure do on both|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No.  I give the best information I have and hope they find it useful.
VQdqogD7aa	I'm not sure I fully understand your question.  However, I'll take a stab.<br>  Yahoo! Messenger can be downloaded from site:<br>  <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/">http://messenger.yahoo.com/</a><br>  The installation of Messenger will also install the Y! Toolbar (if it is not already installed) unless you do a custom installation.<br>  You do have a subset of Messenger functions already built-in to Y! Mail (it's call chat) and you don't need to install Y! Messenger.  Also you have another online web application to use Messenger functions at site:<br>  <a href="http://webmessenger.yahoo.com/">http://webmessenger.yahoo.com/</a><br>  And lastly you can add a Messenger button (assumes you have installed Y! Messenger) to the Yahoo! Toolbar:<br>  <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com/toolbar/personalize/index.php?intl=us">http://toolbar.yahoo.com/toolbar/persona...</a><br>  I hope that answers your question.

MPbB0ri1aa	Points on Y!A are to add interest and fun to the site. You do not “win” anything. As you accumulate more points you gain the ability to vote more or ask more questions. This page explains it in more detail ( <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AvnNXN4S.Hu14qzaRlqI7sPsy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a> ) you can click on the question mark next to "Total Points" on your profile.<br>  <br>  There are some people who enjoy this feature and like to see how they compare with others or just like to watch their own points accumulate. Others don’t care about the points at all and just enjoy answering the questions.<br>  <br>  It is not without its downside. There are many who cheat, but the point system is here to stay, I am sure.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Accumulating points moves you up in levels.  Read the rules
f0eQ5ILEaa	You can try searching him on some of these social networks like FaceBook or MySpace.<br>  Nowadays almost everyone has an account there so you can find his email there if listed or just message him/her and ask for it.<br>  <br>  Another option is just google him and he may be listed somewhere!
MPbB0ri1aa	Here are the reasons I can think of as to why:<br>  <br>  1) New to using the computer and not familiar with searching<br>  2) Not good at searching and it frustrates them too much to try<br>  3) More interested in other peoples’ personal knowledge than what they can find on the Internet.<br>  4) Hoping for a quick answer and eliminate the need to take the time to search.<br>  5) Very young, bored, and/or lazy users.<br>  <br>  A couple of things to keep in mind when these types of questions frustrate you:<br>  <br>  One of the purpose of Y!A is to be a searchable source for answers. When someone uses a search engine, questions here show up. So, for example, if someone finds a particular question on their search and thinks “That is exactly what I want to know” , click on it and only sees the answer “search for it yourself” that must be frustrating for them.<br>  <br>  Why pass up and opportunity to use your own searching skills to formulate a good answer and possibly get another 10 points out of if by getting selected as best answer ;) ?|`|ku52Yf0Gaa	I am too bloody lazy, and I enjoy the variety of perspectives.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You can use the thumbs up /down function now that you have reached Level 2.<br>  The thumbs are supposed to indicate what you thought of another user's answer. You can thumb answers to Open or Resolved questions, you can't thumb while an answer while the question is in voting.<br>  If an answer is picked as best answer, each thumb up is worth 1 extra point.<br>  A thumb down doesn't cost you any points and a thumb up is worth 1 point only if your answer is picked as best.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Thumbs up or down are given by other members who feel the answer is incorrect.|`|qiEMAS4uaa	Thumbs up means you agree with the answer if the answer is perfect for the question this also helps the voter in voting the best answer.Thumbs down means the answer is not suitable for the question.<br>  <br>  HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.|`|fDGlC403aa	If u agree with an answer you can give it a thumbs up.

When you give TD's nothing of any practical value happens.  When you give out TU's, and if the person's answer is picked as best answer, then the total number of thumbs ups they have is added on to the 10 points they get for being chosen as best answr. <br>  There's a daily limit of 50 points if you accrue points in this manner.|`|1d0cc0ea5546dfbb6d1b826ce4a34599aa	They are basically the ratings for each answerers users click.

O8439phAaa	The short answer      "No"<br>  <br>  The long answer.       I work in a company where I semi manage the security of our users.  It is required that we do not store the password.  I have full administrative access to all users accounts in our company.  When you view the account it just showes ****** for the password.  This is to keep the user save.  If the passwords were stored in a way that they could be recovered then hackers would be trying to break into Yahoos systems and find them.  So in other words they don't store your password for recovery so that hackers can't steal it.
suPD7c3gaa	Match.com isn't a scam, but like anywhere, whether on the internet or in life, there are people who will use people that way, and sites like Match.com is a site people like that will use for that purpose.  That is DEFINITELY a scam!  I'm having a little trouble believing this though.  Your father is an adult. Why would he fall for such a thing?  It it's true, everything that woman says and does reeks of scam.  There are similar confirmed Match.com scam stories all over the internet!  What woman would meet a guy, and almost immediately ask for a loan?  If I were in financial difficulties and someone new in my life offered me money without me even asking, I'd refuse.  I have NO DOUBT this is a scam.  Your father can't possibly be that naive.  If he is, you need to do some research to prove to him it's a scam.  Get on Google.  Prove it to him.  Personally, I'd immediately report this exchange to Match.com.  Although it's very possible this person, no longer is a member.  They often drop out as soon as they've got a sucker.  Then join again using another name.  Yes... you have plenty of reason to be worried.<br>  <br>  Here's something to read, and your father needs to read too:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/columns/industry/2008/onlinedatingscams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/colu...</a><br>  <br>  Another link from the above site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/news2006/onlinedatingscams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/news...</a><br>  <br>  MUST READ<br>  <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/content/news/localshows/dontwasteyourmoney/story/Avoid-Online-Dating-Scams/dtSUVdO4z0ycVsmTTAMfuw.cspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.wcpo.com/content/news/localsh...</a><br>  <br>  There's lots more!!|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Yup; your dad is letting his hormones overrule his brain.  There are people like this woman all over dating boards.  If you have ANY influence with your father, make sure he DOESN'T send any money to this person (it may not even BE a woman).  And contact Match.com to report "her" behavior!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FZLiRKIjaa	call better business bureau|`|AA11252878	If your father is about to be scammed, he better notify the Match.com people about this right away. Warn him to never give her nothing at all. The woman he's already chatting with now is nothing but an outright fraud. By warning your dad about this now, he can spare of being scammed. You have a right to be worried about your dad in this matter you brought up in this question.

suPD7c3gaa	Ok, so instead of 1 question for your 5 points, you've asked 3 questions.<br>  <br>  1.  finding a new yahoo email address.  An email address isn't something you need to find.  You go to www.yahoo.com, click on "Mail".  If already logged into your Yahoo! account you may be directed straight to your mail page, or you could be directed to the log on page.  That's where you enter your Yahoo! ID and password.<br>  <br>  2. Briefcase.  Yahoo! Briefcase is one of Yahoo's free services for file storage/sharing.  It has nothing to do with your Yahoo! mail account.  It's a service that's available to all Yahoo! members.  We don't have to sign up for it.  If you don't know what it is, you likely weren't using it. There's nothing you need to do, or worry about.<br>  <br>  3.  Instant Messenger.   That question makes absolutely no sense.  "...old one oe my new one..."?????? Huh?  Seriously... what does that mean?  Are you talking about your old Instant Messenger, or possibly a newly downloaded newer version?  If you have a shortcut created for the old one, and it's still on your computer, that's what will open when you click on it.  Drag that shortcut to the recycle bin.  You should know where on your computer you installed the new version.  Go there and right click, and create a short cut.  OR, you might want to rename the old verson, so your system doesn't have to versions with the same name (which is possible if they are located in 2 different places on your computer), or delete the old version altogether.  Of course I'm just guessing at what you're asking.  We shouldn't have to guess.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're talking about an old computer vs. a new computer?  If you didn't re-download Yahoo! Messenger when/if you got a new computer, you'd have to do that.<br>  <br>  You might want to post a new question asking about your Yahoo! Messenger issue.  BUT... before you hit that "Submit" button, re-read your question.  Make sure it makes sense, and make sure you've provided enough details if deemed necessary to clarify your concerns.<br>  <br>  Next  time:  ONE question at a time.
x3g1vk46aa	I want it gone too.  I was so happy when it disappeared yesterday morning for the rest of the day, but the cursed thing is back today.

I'm more than ticked that yahoo loaded this onto my computer without the option to decline it or now delete it.  I'm on dial up and any kind of chat/messenger locks up my connection.

I was worried it was cheating.<br>  <br>  The community was very gracious and informed me that it is fine to ask multiple questions in 1 posting, as long as they were all some what related.<br>  <br>  I was also warned that there is a limit though. They advised me to keep it at about 2-3, maybe 4, and to keep it simple and strait to the point. They called it something, which I am sorry I can't recall, but you can rec'v a violation if it is abused.<br>  <br>   If I remember, I'll come back with an {edit}. K?<br>  <br>  Once again, Welcome to the Yahoo Answers Community!!<br>  <br>  Take Care!!<br>  <br>  _______ ~_~.<br>  <br>  .|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Yes, it is ok up to a point.  The questions should be related and you can't push it to 5 or more questions.  If you ask unrelated or too many in one post, it is call a pop-quiz violation.  Some have tried to post 100 in one post.  They get violated if too obvious.|`|AA11045021	It's okay, as long as it isn't the same question.|`|51SDOKOiaa	Yes and is that a trick ?

BKjnDG99aa	it's invalid per Yahoo<br>  <br>  No generic addresses: Email addresses such as webmaster@domain.com or postmaster@domain.com cannot be used to join a group. Messages from Groups should be personal and should not use email addresses which commonly recycled within an organization. In addition, spammers commonly target these addresses. For all these reasons, we disallow their user on the service. <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/ownmod/email/email-23.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/...</a>|`|WaI693jHaa	That looks like a valid mail address as long as the last "***" is "co".<br>  ".co.uk" is possible.

This is easily done. A tip:<br>  Highlight and copy the address in its original form then go to the group and paste it in.

ySobWXx6aa	I know exactally how you are feeling right now. Is your boyfriend locked up in jail or in prison? The state that you live in might have a corrections website that you can go on. In Minnesota we have one that connects all the prisons together and you go and look under offender locator and you either type in their OID (offender id #) or name or birthday and it will tell you there offense and there release date. If your boyfriend is in jail and you  know where that jail is located it is easy just to call there and depending on the facilities visitation rules you could ask if they have you on their list of visitors, or if they dont have a list find out vistation times. I went through the same thing as you. My boyfriend (husband now) was sent to jail a few times, then to prison for 14 months, and its no fun at the beginning when you have no idea whats going on and when he will be released. Hang in there, it will get better with time.|`|35lMMHxuaa	okie if its jail call the jail he is in to see what is going on ( charges, bond date, etc) if its prison then u have to have certain info such as his id# etc. <br>  <br>  you may want to check with his family to see if they have any info that could be help full to u ..<br>  <br>  as far as website i dont think there is.. any that will  give u that kind of information...<br>  <br>  gud luck to u!|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Dont get involved with someone who gets locked up. Drop him now while you still can. Ya know what happens there don't you?They also tell you only what they think you need to hear just to keep you coming back.|`|5c52aa995c60e7a74645dc2f495b5785aa	why dont u just go to the prison that he is being held at and try to find information, or able to visit.   not sure how u say u dont have a way of reaching him.|`|AA12164378	Go to google, type in the prison name and then search by his id number.  If you don't know his id number, call the prison and find out visiting hours or his id number.|`|fslABgDnaa	Locked up as in jail? Forget that loser and find someone who is worth your time!|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Where was he placed. I need a location, prison state etc..more info please.

Some people apparently would rather have someone else look it up for them, or they wouldn't ask here.  I may already have the knowledge, but sometimes providing an answer based on that knowledge isn't always enough.  And I can understand that.  So answering with what I already know AND providing a link to back it up makes sense to me.

FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|4lfHX2mqaa	check out this one responsiblepast.cn<br> <br>  you can also visit <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unblockcityorg" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/unblockci...</a> and subscribe to daily lists

These are four good sites with various levels of complexity.<br>  <br>  The basic idea is  container with the "lava" and some mountain built around it, from papier mache, modelling clay or compacted damp sand.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Your Avatar.<br>  <br>  Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo. The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: Many people are having problems with the Yahoo 360 avatar showing up. My only recommendation is to wait or try deleting and recreating it.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|oX8TdFwSaa	You have to get to a certain level before you can do that
7u77AiBjaa	The problem is that Yahoo! 360 is a beta (i.e. testing) service and some features do not work correctly. It's been this way since 2005. So, glitches/problems were likely and using the service is a risk for users. Modules have become more glitchy since Yahoo! announced that they would no longer fix 360-related bugs starting October 2007, as they prepared to transition the service to a universal profile system. This UPS has started as of October 16, 2008, but the 360 transition to that platform hasn't been completed yet.<br>  <br>  Make sure that the image that you are using is a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB that's saved to your hard drive. You may want to try re-saving the image in Microsoft Paint, as sometimes that helps Yahoo recognize the image.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you leave the module completely alone because it can cause other serious problems on your page like it making your Top Page very long - which may or may not be fixable. You can also lose more spots in the module. This has been a buggy module for a long time. Some people recommend that you keep trying to add the image and/or wait for the image to miraculously appear (which may work), but I'm warning you that messing with the module too much is a risky method.<br>  <br>  Also, please note the 360 community guidelines (<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-08.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> ) regarding mature content. The personal profile area is a public area, which can't be changed from that status. Adult images must be placed ONLY in the blog under mature content controls. IF you have been reported for adult images in that module or in the 360 background, then Yahoo could have removed those images. This inadvertently could have resulted in those spots being lost as well.<br>  <br>  So, you probably can't fix this issue. If you want to add more images to 360, add them to your background and/or blog area.<br>  <br>  <br>  - See blogs at <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> and <a href="http://www.yprofileblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yprofileblog.com</a> for more details about the 360 transition. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on the Yahoo! 360 blog, but don't expect a personal response.<br>  - See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=858">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for more information on 360 glitches.<br>  - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1414">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1168">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1236">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> .

"Big Brother" is a fictional character in a George Orwell novel about authority surveillance in a fictional society.  "Big Brother is watching you" came from that novel.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	It is possible, we might have missed it since we tend to ignore the rules so much.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to start bribing those of us who've recently asked questions.<br>  <br>  My bank account is pretty healthy, even in this recession, so nothing short of sexual favors will get you a BA here.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	There is no such rule.  The only Level 1 rule that is different is that you can not rate answers with a thumbs up or thumbs down.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Very true. So go answer all of mine lol.|`|fCXuNGHraa	Yes, In addition you have to send nude pics.|`|oENe16luaa	But on level 1 you are also not allowed to ask any questions.  You can't just pick and chose which rules to apply.|`|iHJuXKBiaa	Rosie you know tonight is orgy night, and if you don't follow the rules.........well you know.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Hmmm....well if that is what the rules state then I shall abide.<br>  <br>  I got 1 open Q about dogs :)<br>  <br>  IDK what else to ask.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Sure, answer my question and I'll make it happen.
lnEyq5claa	go on goolgle and look one up
F0h2iFWsaa	yep, no prizes, no cash, no certificates.....<br>  <br>  All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.<br>  <br>  Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.<br>  <br>  Hints: <br>  <br>  answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)<br>  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)<br>  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)<br>  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)<br>  you also get a point a day for signing in<br>  <br>  each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Yes you have it one, points do make prizes on this site.  The more points you have then the you start to move up to different levels.  You keep going until level 7 and then that's it, you have reached the final level and the points just keep mounting up.<br>  Moving up the levels means you can ask and answer more questions and more voting, but that's about it. There is of course the satisfaction knowing that you have exchanged ideas and passed on knowledge to quite a few people.|`|t7hFh8STaa	Yes, it is like in a game when you reach another level, you feel accomplishment and satisfaction with your own self.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	What did you expect, a new car? lol
gGZz2EGyaa	Perhaps it is so that they can sort out all the little glitches that happen on here.  I gave up last night on here every time I clicked on something it seemed to freeze and then after a while got going again.  I must have only been on here 20 minutes and I thought enough is enough and logged out. I suppose with a busy site like this there will be a lot of downtime to sort any problems out.<br>  It can be frustrating when you have answered a question and it takes so long to get going and then wallop Yahoo is having a breather!|`|a93474086f6fa35adcb7945afb0f5aa4aa	they are having a cuppa tea and a digestive.

Your second seems to be a bit rude and insulting. Becoming a Top Contributor has nothing to do with the number of points.<br>  <br>  To get a Top Contributor (even though you really don't want one), one would just keep answering a lot of questions in ONE category. Answer only quality questions with helpful, informative quality answers to give you a better chance at getting Best Answer for your answers. The exact formula isn't publicized, but it's rumored we need to answer approx. 50 questions in the one category in a 30-day period, and of those answers, get 10% best answers. You'd have to maintain that balance of Best Answers to total answers to keep the Top Contributor badge once you get it.
