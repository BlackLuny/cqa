I am currently 21 years old, and a student at Ryerson University. Rather than living on residence, or in a cheap apartment, I would rather move into a nice place where I can settle. I am thinking around $1300 - $1500 (with utilities) for a one bedroom that I can split rent with my girlfriend.       But what is the reality for me as a student, and first time renter, being able to rent a condo or loft? I have employer references, but no past renter references. My credit should be good, I maintain a Visa and always have it payed (and have used it a lot for school and such).      I have already applied for one condo. Four other people also applied, and so I was not chosen from the four that applied to rent it. Is this what I am going to have to expect with my limited references if I apply for condos and more expensive places?

My husband and I sent our 30 notice to our rental company that we would not be renewing our lease. We told them to contact us to make an appointment for the walk through. We got a reply back through the e-mail saying, "We do not do walk-throughs with the renters present. You will return the keys to us and we will do a walk-through, and send you your deposit (minus damages).       Is this legal? I'm not comfortable with this. I've never had a landlord not "allow me" to attend the walk through. I think it makes things easier that way (plus I can keep an eye on them and make sure they aren't charging for things that aren't my fault).      More than anything, I just don't trust this company. One of the reasons we decided to move is because we have been annoyed with the way they treat us.      So, is this legal? Thanks! Oh, we live in Florida.

20090130183626AAjScIW	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Careers Involving Animals?	I would appreciate if people wouldn't respond to this with the cliche "you shouldn't be in it for the money", I'd just like a straightforward response.   I have always been an animal lover and assumed I would end up becoming a veterinarian.  Lately I have been researching salaries from various sources and found that veterinarians don't get paid particularly well, especially in comparison to a career as a Family Physician or a general medical practitioner.  Is there a reason for this? Are there any other jobs involving animals with higher salaries?
20090130185047AA9VGDw	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	What is the right career for me?	I am in college right now and I know I want to do something in the nursing field. I want to be an RN but I don't think the classes are right for me (I have to get an associates in science before I can take any nursing classes). I was thinking about maybe becoming a PN but I don't know if it is an actual degree (the book doesn't say) or if there is any future for a PN as a career. My goal is to become a physical therapist/nurse practitioner. I don't know if I should get my associates in science and just take it from there or what. I am just bored because I want to start doing nursing courses and can't. Please if anyone has any ideas or advice I would be more than appreciative. It would be wonderful if people with experience in my goals would help me decide.

20090130171859AAmUCfL	Business & Finance;Insurance	I would like to know what to do now?	My Father is 75 my mother is in Hospice care.  We just put her in a Nursing Home and got approved for Medicaid.  We also recently paid for her's and my father's funeral costs.  When we went to set up the funerals we were told that if we pay upfront instead of waiting til death and having them work to cash in the insurance policies we would save 30% - thinking this was a good idea, we did so but my father does not have $10,000 in savings so we used his home equity line to pay this amount and now I am wondering a couple of things: 1. Should we now go ahead and cash in her/his insurance policy to pay this back (Whole Life Policy - I believe)?  How does this effect Medicaid?  We neen by next year to show we paid down Mom's assets and yet we have not as yet used her asset but took out the loan.  The funeral home said paying for the funeral was an allowable way to spend down, but that would have been if she had that amount in an asset correct?  Now what should we do?

I've seen that average rent in an apartment complex is about $350/month. It says the the 1BR units include:      Amenities       * Air conditioning       * Cable ready       * Carpeting       * Ceiling fan      Kitchen       * Dishwasher       * Garbage disposal       * Refrigerator      Which I guess is alright. Maybe. I don't really know what I'm looking for =\ I know that it stays warmer down there compared to here in Wisconsin, So I can't really ask my parents about how much their bills are, because 1) it's the complete wrong state, and 2) the bills right now are for 5 people.      I need to know how much money to budget per month.   I know that the necessities (per month) are:      rent = 350   cell phone = 75   car insurance = 100   food = 150 (50 a week will be plenty for me)   gas for car = 100   electricity = ?   water = ?   other expenses = ?      or would it be cheaper and more efficient to pay 545 a month, with all utilities included. Plus my other expenses (which I'm not exactly sure what they will be yet)      Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Executive Summary We design and deliver the systems, software and services that drive next-generation communications networks. Backed by Bell Labs research and development, we use our strengths in mobility, optical, access, data and voice networking technologies, as well as services, to create new revenue-generating opportunities for our customers, while enabling them to quickly deploy and better manage their networks. Our customer base includes communications service providers, governments and enterprises worldwide. We have three segments organized around the products and services we sell. The reportable segments are Integrated Network Solutions (“INS”), Mobility Solutions (“Mobility”) and Lucent Worldwide Services (“Services”). INS provides a broad range of software and wireline equipment related to voice networking (primarily consisting of switching products, which we sometimes refer to as convergence solutions, and voice messaging products), data and network management (primarily consisting of access and related data networking equipment and operating support software) and optical networking. Mobility provides software and wireless equipment to support radio access and core networks. Services provides deployment, maintenance, professional and managed services in support of both our product offerings as well as multi-vendor networks. Beginning in fiscal 2001, the global telecommunications market deteriorated, resulting from a decrease in the competitive local exchange carrier market and a significant reduction in capital spending by established service providers.This trend intensified during fiscal 2002 and continued into fiscal 2003. Reasons for the market deterioration included general economic slowdown, network overcapacity, customer bankruptcies, network build-out delays and limited availability of capital. We believe that the market for telecommunications equipment has stabilized and is starting to grow in certain areas. The growing demands of enterprises and consumers for additional services tailored to their needs is creating the need for a new convergence of networks, technologies and applications. Required 1. Using the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Lucent Technologies for September 30, 2004 and 2003, prepare a common-size balance sheet. 2. Evaluate the asset, debt, and equity structure of Lucent Technologies, as well as trends and changes found on the common-size balance sheet. 3.

20090130194045AAgbcUw	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Mortgage - 30 year fixed + extra principal or 15 year?	We're looking to refinance and are trying to choose between a 30 year fixed or 15 year fixed. Given the economy there are always worries one of us will be laid off, so the 30 year gives lower minimum payments. But a 15 year requires much less interest over the length of the loan. However, if we pay extra on the 30 year we can pay it off earlier.      For example (not our real numbers, they are much higher, we're in CA):   $200k for 15 years at 5% = $1581.59/m    $200k for 30 years at 5% = $1073.64/m      but if we pay an extra $508/m on the 30 year we can pay it off in 15 years.      Are there any issues with this logic assuming the mortgage does not have a prepayment penalty?

20090130201034AA4EC8Y	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	What type of bachelor degree are lawyers looking for when they want to hire a paralegal?!?	I'm enrolled in a two year paralegal program at a technical college right now.  I looked at a lot of job listings for paralegals and all of them said that a bachelors degree is preferred.  I feel like it's going to be a lot harder to get a job with only an associates degree, so I would like to get a bachelors degree instead.  But I can't figure out if a bachelors degree in paralegal is preferred, or is a bachelors degree preferred in something like finance or criminal justice to specialize in a certain area depending on what type of paralegal someone would want to be?    If I were interested in becoming a criminal defense paralegal should I finish at the technical college I go to and get my associates degree for paralegal, then transfer to a four year college and get a bachelors degree in criminal justice? Or if I wanted to become a corporate law paralegal do I transfer to the four year college and get a bachelors degree in something like business?? I'm totally lost on what type of bachelor degree a lawyer would be looking for!!
20090130200714AAIjR8L	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Is there a way to erase my chargeoff completely and make my account go back to normal?	I moved to my parents because I lost my job.  During the move 2 banks went to charge off and since then I got a new job and paid them off.  Both Banks show 0 balance owed and I re-started my account with Arvest Bank.  They have stopped my debit cards and balance protection.  I want them to make it back to normal since it was all sorta out of my control.  I want to know if there is a way to erase the errors and make my account go back to normal.  Is it based on my credit score or just a policy with the banks.  Can I pay to make things back to the way they were?

20090130201209AA75VR8	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Start alimony again after 20 years.?	I've been divorced for 25 years.  About 6 months ago I started sending money on a regular basis to my ex because she can't make ends meet.  Can I claim this as alimony if she reports it on her tax filing?  I originally paid her alimony for 5 years after the divorce.  What are the rules?  I read what the IRS had to say and it was not clear, but it appears that it is legal if we both report the payments.  Is there a statute of limitation or some problem if there is a lapse of many years?  I would like to get any tax break that I can.
20090130201233AAuO4yf	Business & Finance;Credit	Fraud- what if i pay the debt, can i negotiate to get the card back to use?	I have bad credit from medical bills. I always wanted a "credit card" come to find out someone opened a target card in my name- and charged a couple hundred dollars and now they are after me to pay them. I am wondering and I know this is wierd, but now I am more screwed....Can i try to negotiate with Target to get the card back?  I want the target card, i'll pay the bill. I think paying the $200 is worth it to have the card to actually use. i dont know how long it has been in collections, but when i moved here to my new place about 6 months ago i started to recieve phone calls and letters. Or is it better to just report it as fraud? what will that do to my credit? They said it wasnt an application that someone filled out. It was an offer on a reciept that i threw out offering the card with just a signature or something-which is odd. thanks in advance!

20090130202342AA2lSBa	Business & Finance;Corporations	Has anyone heard of Eastern Asset Management?	My husband received a phone call from an "attorney" regarding a 5 year old credit card debt. They threatened him with many things: involving the military, taking him to court, etc. The debt was almost $3000, but they would "settle" if he paid $2000 over the phone. He asked them to send a statement via mail, but they refused. The guy said "Cut the bullshit, you either pay or else". So he made the payment. When we saw the transaction come through it was to a company called "Eastern Asset Management". I've done some Research on this company and it isn't looking good. They have threatened so many people & convinced them to pay their debts with no letter, no notice, anything. Personally, I believe it was a scam. What do you think?
