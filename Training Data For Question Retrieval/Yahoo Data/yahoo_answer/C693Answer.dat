6yMIZJTNaa	Ask one of your senior classmates? Lawlz. . .|`|N2toIg3Baa	Sweetie let me tell you dating a popular girl... really not worth it. Do you really want to spend your prom night with a girl who will be completely surrounded by drama? You want to have fun on your prom night. Find a girl who isn't scared to be herself and someone you can have a fun filled night with. Not all the hot girls have to be popular. My advice to you is this find a girl you are interested in taking the prom and impress her. Once you have her attention ask her to go with you and if shes the kind of girl you even want to be seen with then she will say yes.|`|AEhgE7kpaa	Change your image, re-do the hair, dress in fashion, note details - shoes, belts etc.. spiff up the car. <br>  <br>  Next , scope out the other High Schools in the area , and fish in their pond for better Bass.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting!|`|P6hXQAgFaa	just be nice to a girl!  if you are nice a girl will just naturally like you! and if a girl doesn't fall for you just go with a girl as friends!
jUZP2QZPaa	capita a tutti prima o poi di passare momenti piuttosto grigi........se non addirittura neri ! Innanzitutto (lo dici tu...) non ti hanno abbandonato tutti perchè hai la tua famiglia e, credimi, al giorno d'oggi è già una cosa importantissima poter contare sulla famiglia! Cerca anche di non mandare "a fare benedire" la fede perchè è proprio in certi momenti che è necessario averne...........<br>  Abbi fiducia in te stesso e nelle buone qualità che sicuramente avrai, inizia a voler bene a te stesso e vedrai che anche intorno le cose cambieranno.<br>  Un abbraccio sincero.|`|Q2hp8q5aaa	si a volte capita ma sono sensazioni passeggere,fidati!!!!!!!|`|1eo9D0QMaa	Fortunatamente non mi è mai capitato di sentirmi cos' male, però è capitato a delle mie amiche, per varie ragioni. Devo però dire che a distanza di un pò di tempo (un pò di tempo ci vuole, inutile negarlo) le vedo ancora più forti di prima. La cosa che non devi assolutamente fare è rinchiuderti in casa e stare da solo, anzi, cerca di uscire e vedere delle persone amiche che ti tirino un pò su...lo so, non deve essere facile all'inizio...in bocca al lupo! Ciao, Deva|`|I0dIEIUXaa	si è capiteto anche a me. 3 anni fa. è stato un periodo bruttissimo. So x esperienza cosa provi e mi dispiace un sacco. xò dai nn abbaterti e cerca il positivo in qualsiasi esperienza anche se appare molto negativa. Vedrai che qualcosa di positivo ci sarà! Cm prima cosa pensa che questo che ti è appena successo ti servirà in futuro e ti permetterà di maturare sempre più. Poi ti posso assicurare che molte volte sentono queste sensazioni le persone poco sicure di se stesse.. forse nn è il tuo caso, ma se  lo fosse cerca di contare più di te stessa e di apprezzarti. Poi in qualsiasi situazione, + pensi che ti stia andando tutto male + tutto va male! buona fortuna..<br>  <br>  PS: nn so forse il mio consiglio nn ti sarà molto utile, anche perchè forse nn sono proprio la persona più giusta! ma spero davvero che tu presto ne esca da questa situazinone nel modo migliore x te! ciao ciao =)|`|LXCVjmRFaa	certo.. e non 1 sola volta.. ma ora x fortuna sto bene  cmq sta tranquillo/a passerà sn solo momenti.. un kiss|`|RpUVaL8yaa	suvvia dai cerca di lottare per non essere giù<br>  tanto essendo così non ci concludi nulla roprenditi e darti forza

At a certain age i think women expect men to be able to step up to the plate, date-wise. And you aren't a young kid anymore, women get more picky with age. Try asking someone out in person.
TqAz0ETfaa	Il mio migliore amico lo conosco da più di 3 anni...ci fosse una volta che si è ricordato del giorno del mio compleanno :) io mi ricordo sempre, lui mai...però che mi vuole bene me lo dimostra sempre...quindi non mi importa più di tanto che si dimentichi di farmi gli auguri, so per certo che per qualsiasi cosa lui ci sarà..è questo l'importante, e forse è così anche per il tuo amico!|`|eX7laf6Laa	io mi arrabbierei|`|2S4qt3Bkaa	Ciao!

Non condannarlo per il fatto che non si è ricordato deltuo compleanno!!! a volte può capitare di dimenticarsi anche delle persone a cui si vuole bene (mi è succeso a me!!!), perchè magari si è presi da qulacosa per esempio il lavoro,la scuola,l'amore,la famiglia...insomma potrebbe aver avuto qualsiasi problema!!!<br>  comunque parlarci e fagli capire che stai male perchè tieni a lui...in bocca al lupo!!!|`|urTuluqraa	su cn la vita!!! capita a tt di dimentikare qlcs!!!|`|yhyYIRtpaa	lo uccidooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo xD...<br>  hihi... skerzo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  beh... però... starei molto...molto triste...!!! :( :'(<br>  <br>  spero che nn mi accada mai... ho già troppe delusioni... mi manca solo qst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|EKbd0P1Vaa	ciao vorrei sapere cosa provi per lui,sei sicura che è solo amicizia??sai anche a me è capitato che un mio caro amico non mi ha fatto gli auguri,addirittura non si è fatto sentire neanche quando è nato mio figlio,ma ci siamo chiariti e ho capito che vivevamo la nostra amicizia in modo diverso,magari tu la senti di più e lui meno oppure è solo una fase è anche poco che vi conoscete,fai passare un po di tempo non ti fare sentire e vedrai che ti richiama se ci tiene davvero alla vostra amicizia.Magari si è spaventato perché ha frainteso i tuoi sentimenti e si è raffreddato un po il rapporto,per finire sta tranquilla che se è amicizia vera si risolve tutto!!!!pensa che la mia amicizia dura ormai da ben 6 anni!!!!|`|OC2DGyv9aa	Rendi pan per focaccia dimenticati anche tu del suo|`|TniISS2faa	Semplice non dite nulla,poi quando sarà il suo compleanno,trattenevi dalla tentazione di fargli gli auguri o,se proprio non riuscite fateglieli con entusiamo,o con un regalo paricolare,che non passi inosservato in modo che gli capiti di pensare come ricambiarvi,e morire di vergogna quando scopre che se lo è dimenticato.|`|UrU4tnP3aa	ma si può dire che nemmeno vi conoscete...non fermarti all'apparenza e dagli tempo...ciao!|`|VF5vJfbHaa	...beh secondo me 2 mesi sono poki per conoscere bene una persona...cmq se s è scordato del tuo comple nn è niente di preocupante...anke se ti capisco ankio avevo un amica a cui tenevo molto ma lei nn m faceva mai gli auguri e io si...poi lei in 3 media m a abbondonata x un altra compagnia e nn c sent piu da 2 anni...cmq per quanto riguarda te devi sapere ke talvolta i ragazzi sono molto più riservati rispetto noi ragazze, e anke se c tiene a te tende a tenersi le cose per se...la cosa ke devi fare è parlargli seriamente e fare in modo d fargli tirare fuori il problema...magari è solo un periodo...io con la mia migliore amica c litigavo quasi tutte le settimane e finiva sempre ke io ero quella ke doveva and a kied scusa, perke lei è troppo orgogliosa e nn sarebbe mai ven...poi un giorno ne o avute piene le palle e nn sono più and a rincorerla e dopo un settimana ke nn c parlavamo più s è fatta avanti e io m sono sfogata, da li nn abbiamo più litigato...se il tuo amico è un po come lei prova ad adottare lo stex metodo se no fai come t o detto prima, parlaci....|`|lJGp6yZvaa	guarda....mi sn dimenticata d fare gli auguri al mio miglior amico x i 17 anni.. io lo adoravo...nn potevo stare senza  dlui...ma capita..ero presa dalle mille cose da fare..xò qnd il mio miglior amico nn è vneto ai miei 18 dp avermi promesso mille cose nn l'ho xdonato totalmente|`|vuebWcgaaa	.. bah, secondo me sei cotta di lui!!!|`|wzX7aG6Saa	Daiii puo capitare anke ai migliori di dimenticarsi del compleanno di un'amika..
C50XH7NDaa	Credo che non faccia differenza se lui o lei. Ciò che secondo me cambia è la modalità con cui ci si fa avanti, a seconda che si sia uomo o donna. A parte questo, però, credo sia insito nella natura umana cercare di avere ciò che si vuole, o che ci interessa, che siamo uomini o donne. Una donna può essere interessata ad un uomo e dimostrarglielo senza per questo essere volgare o altro. Non credo ci sia nulla di male nel chiedere ad un ragazzo che mi piace di bere un caffè.|`|nNQCLRdHaa	lui anche se ormai siamo sempre noi ragaze che dobbiamo fare il primo passo seno se si aspetta voi si è gia decrepite!!!!!!!!|`|51ZyK0r8aa	deve essere l'uomo...secondo me...io nn farei mai il primo passo anche se nn sn per nulla timida ma a mio parere deve essere il maschio|`|1lX4fnQJaa	L'uomo, non c'è dubbio. Deve corteggiare se è interessato e chiedere alla donna di uscire. E non il contrario perchè la donna sfacciatamente cacciatrice  sa di ridicola e poco seria. Poi dipende sempre da che tipo di relazione si vuole stabilire....|`|B0baMgv6aa	in teoria dovrebbe essere l uomo a fare la prima mossa...ma alcune volte nn è mai così...dipende se questo ragazzo è molto timido ti conviene a te fare la prima mossa|`|YLJsQovSaa	sia  lui che lei...secondo la società è lui che dovrebbe farsi avanti...ma cosa te ne frega non è una gara...fatti avanti|`|meGktACDaa	E' difficile dare una risposta "netta".<br>  <br>  E' vero che molto spesso ci sono ancora pregiudizi (anche da parte di noi maschietti) sulle donne che prendono l'iniziativa ... è vero anche che solitamente le "lei" sono abilissime a farti capire quanto e come siano interessate a te ...|`|1eo9D0QMaa	Mah...se mi piace molto potrei anche provare a fare il primo passo...solo che per paura di un rifiuto non lo farei....recentemente un mio amico mi ha consigliato di fare il primo passo con un tipo che mi piace, almeno così capisco subito se gli interesso o meno...però non è così facile...|`|KCt1Hgb9aa	E' chiaro che deve essere l'uomo anche se...ci sono le eccezioni e uando capita va bene uguale.|`|TkzuXWqNaa	Il ragazzo perchè noi ragazze siamo timidoneeeeeeeee.......|`|Ve5vMrUNaa	io penso ke e' il uomo ad avvicinarsi....pero' lo puo fare anke una femmina, nn c'e' scritto da nessuna parte ke lo deve fare x forza l'uomo...|`|VzVsFqsEaa	l'altro!<br>  a parte gli scherzi,<br>  diciamo che al giorno d'oggi nn dovrebbro piu esserc differenze in qst senso,<br>  tradizionalmente però dovrebbe essere l'uomo...<br>  a me personalmente,che sono uomo,piace farmi corteggiare e mettere la ragazza che mi piace nella condizione d dichiararsi per prima<br>  (avete voluto la parità dei sessi,no?!?heheeh) <br>  puo anche capitare che la situazione faccia avvicinare entrambi nello stesso tempo,metaforicamente parlando,come nei migliori film in cui l'uno finisce le frasi dell'altro..<br>  credo cmq,che se c'è una persona che t interessa davvero tu devi farle capire assolutamente che t interessa,che tu t dichiari apertamente o meno,<br>  piuttosto meglio un 2 d picche che brucia x due giorni,piuttosto che avre il rimorso d nn averc provato minimamente cn la ragazza che magari poteva essere l'amore della tua vita!<br>  concludendo,hai ragione anche tu,probabilmente le donne.,<br>  anche se molto piu "attive" in quel senso,<br>  hanno nel loro backgruond il quadro che l'uomo faccia sempre la prima mossa,<br>  ma che dire,<br>  l'importante è che almeno uno dei due la faccia qst benedetta prima mossa,<br>  l'importante è provarci!!|`|o1t7qmYoaa	Secondo me la possono fare tutti e due|`|wF5jCfCEaa	io credo che l'uomo debba fare il 1 passo e corteggiare, se ci prova  la donna l'uomo di solito scappa o no? ciao|`|Zq72BuKSaa	Guarda è bello se è un uomo .. però nn c'è niente di male se è una ragazza a fare la prima mossa... .ok?|`|b9lRmj6zaa	entrambi..sia lui ke lei:))|`|eTidVdevaa	si dev'essere l'uomo.. difatti alle ragazze piace essere più prede di solito che predatrici|`|leYz777Qaa	sia lui ke lei posso fare la prima mossa...<br>  non esistono + i cavalieri di una volta e le pricipesse....<br>  sicuramente ki fa la prima mossa si spera sempre sia un maschio....<br>  non è detto però ke se una ragazza faccia la prima mossa sia sbagliato...<br>  l' importante è non restare in posizione di stallo nel senso ke a volte si rischia ke ne 1 ne l' altra facciano una mossa restando in una fase poco chiara...<br>  ragazzi datevi una mossa (io x fortuna sono felicemente fidanzato) e ragazze datevi anke voi un po da fare ke se aspettate il principe rimanete sole!!!!|`|pWcGUZnwaa	Lui, è lui l'uomo, la donna deve essere corteggiata.<br>  Ma non è una questione di pregiudizi, il maschio deve fare l'uomo e deve fare lui la prima mossa, le donne sono una  delicate, e se fanno loro il primo passo secondo me perdono quel loro fascino da donne. <br>  Poi anche in natura tutti gli animali son così, è sempre il maschio che corteggia la donna, vedi i pavoni *-* Che belli.|`|qdBwD5jpaa	secondo me è sempre il maschio ke deve fare il primo passo... :D

ArJY3PMBaa	Numero 1...il tuo ragazzo è la prima persona che ti isola dal resto del mondo...e dicendoti così dimostra solo di essere un ragazzo Immaturo e piuttosto cretino (non offenderti ma è così)...forse pensa che tu vivi grazie a lui...trova nuovi interessi...fai cose diverse ...le amicizie ci sono basta solo cercarle e fare tante esperienze nuove...ricordati sempre di creare una tua vita... i tuoi interessi e fare tante cose diverse al di là del tuo ragazzo...e non farti trattare così... è la cosa peggiore che tu possa fare a te stessa... baci.|`|1eo9D0QMaa	Ma guarda....io sono all'università....le poche amiche che ho sono quelle delle superiori, che riesco a sentire e vedere molto poco, una studia di qui, l'altra lavora di là....poi diciamocelo....dopo le superiori si fa un bel cambiamento...nel senso che ho rivisto delle mie ex compagne che consideravo amiche dopo un bel pò di tempo...beh le ho trovate molto cambiate! ma probabilmente sono cambiata anche io, lo ammetto, non ho nemmeno un carattere facile....però sono sempre sorridente e credo che sia questo a rendermi più simpatica agli altri...e ciò mi ha permesso di conoscere molte persone, (ovviamente non profondamente), però quando le incontri per caso per la strada è bello che ti salutano e magari andare a bere un caffè, parlare di scuola, lavoro eccetera...anche se non sono coetanei! Il mio consiglio è: sorridi e frequenta luoghi dove puoi fare conoscenze, come una palestra, oppure iscriviti a qualche circolo, qualche sport che ti piace, una compagnia teatrale....poi vedrai che se andrai all'università la situazione cambierà!

ku8dGCGkaa	Talk.  It'll be diffucult at first but if your problem is communication (like it sounds like it is) need to ask him to have a discussion. Be casual when asking. If you go in and ask him to "talk" ,dun dun dun, he'll think you going to break up with him. If it's a casual "Can we have a discussion?" he won't be as nervous. If he's asking his friend he's obviously finding this relationship risky, and maybe pulling back from the risk. Gently coax him out from hiding by gently suggesting you two should spend more time together. Don't seem obsessive. Put him in a comfortable environment, maybe a double date, where he can just have a good laugh with a couple of friends. If you keep having to have too many discussions, just tell him your losing it and won't be able to hold on much longer. He'll understand and try harder. No worries, he'll come around. Good Luck!|`|aae33ca98ed4acc2878892601466ebc5aa	How old is he 12? I'm pretty sure he is old enough to make his own decisions.

If you choose to talk with your boyfriend then tell him you understand that he has his mates but you dont appreciate his mates telling him what to do about his relationship with you too. This relationship is about the both of you not the both of you and his mate. <br>  <br>  If your bf needs to talk to you about your relationship NOT his mates.

501dfebf4db22c0aa1bcd164dbe7b74caa	Dipende dall'educazione che viene data ai gfigli. Secondo me 2 genitori possono essere "perfetti" come dici tu ma non in grado di educare come si deve un figlio, nel senso che non si accorgono di come fanno i genitori, anche se sono "perfetti"; possono sbagliare ad educare un figlio, magari perchè tralasciano certi aspetti importanti da insegnare perchè involontariamente pensano che siano cose ovvie, normali, e quindi le tralasciano. Non saprei di preciso, forse un pò sta scritto nel dna ma fondamentalmente penso sia il modo in cui viene educato un figlio, non è detto, per me, che se 2 genitori sono "perfetti" sappiano educare perfettamente!

QBDz3p3Oaa	in classe mia un paio di giorni fa è successa più o meno la stessa cosa...andiamo per la maturità e alle pagelle del primo quadrimestre una mia amica alla quale hanno palesemente comunicato che non verrà ammessa agli esami ha avuto un 6 in una materia contestato dalla sua migliore amica la quale aveva preso 5...quest'ultima riteneva ignobile il fatto di aver preso un voto peggiore rispetto ad una che rischia la bocciatura e le questioni di invidia sono saltate fuori ad una ad una...ora le 2 non si parlano più...con questo voglio farti capire che se questa tua amica cova dell'invidia nei tuoi confronti, che sono certa non si limita al contesto scolastico, lascaila perdere non considerarla più di tanto...capisco perfettamente la tua situazione e il consiglio migliore che posso darti è che una vera amica nel momento<br>  in cui riesci peggio di lei in qualche cosa ti aiuta incondizionatamente e gioisce per te dei tuoi successi riconoscendo in quei casi i propri errori...il perchè lo si può ricercare magari nella sicurezza della propria superiorità di questa persona che puntualmente verrà smentita|`|UjPShReQaa	devi sapere ke l'invidia è una brutta bestia e ti dico ke xme le persone ke si sentono superiori solo xun voto universitario sno insicure e stupide|`|LYiEo6jOaa	C'è gente egocentrica che ha sempre bisogno di stare al centro dell'attenzione, che ha sempre bisogno di sentirsi migliore degli altri...

La misma denota una admiracion y un amor a tu marido ( o ex como quieras ) nada comun en los tiempos que corren. Lamentablemente como dice un refran que no por viejo pierde vigencia " un pel de abajo de una mujer tira mas que cien bueyes". Tu estas obrando con el corazon  y el con la irracionalidad. No le ruegues mas nada. Busca la forma legal de que no pueda ver a sus hijos al menos cuando esta con ella, pues ello puede traumatizar a los menores. No se en que Pais vives y si tienen hecho o no el divorcio vincular. En caso de que no, en la Argentina es pasible de iniciar por parte tuya una causa penal por abandono de hogar y por ende del lecho conyugal. Esa causa procesal se inicia con testigos ( de ser posible ). Soy abogado yme pongo a tu disposicion para lo que sea. <br>  Como amigo te digo nuevamentehazte valer como personay como mujer. Que pasara cuando se acabe el " idilio sexual " conla otra ? quizas sea demasiado tarde para recuperarte. Concientizate que tu no eres titere de el ni de nadie.

Es éL quien te carga en estos momentos. Yo fuí víctima de la infidelidad de mi esposa. Al descubrirla le pregunté sobre lo que deseaba hacer y me pidió quedarnos juntos a luchar por nuestro amor y nuestra familia. Han pasado poco mas de 4 meses y vamos bien a secas. Ella a veces se queda triste y pensativa. Sé que está pensando en el "otro" y me duele. Me parte el alma.<br>  <br>  Yo siempre le dí mucha importancia al sexo porque para mí es una muestra de amor, no solo sexo. Yo sí hacía el amor con mi esposa, no cumplía con los deberes de marido así porque sí, le daba un significado especial. En este tiempo meses he descubierto que mi esposa se enamoró del otro y además lo deseaba de una manera extraordinaria. ?ESO ME PARTíA EL ALMA! ?LLORé COMO UN NI?O 4 MESES COMPLETOS! Me destrozó la vida y aún la perdoné, porque así me lo pidió, pero además porque sé que si sigo teniéndole rencor o hacerme ciego a la realidad solo voy a conseguir más dolor y sufrimiento.<br>  <br>  Es por esto que debes entender que HAY QUE PERDONAR. Eso lo libera a él PERO MáS A TI. Tienes que aceptar que ya se fué y tu relación ya terminó hace más de dos a?os. Sigues sufriendo porque guardas esperanza. NO TENGAS esperanza por alguien que te abandonó embarazada. Verás que el día que tengas un pretendiente querrá regresar pero será tarde.<br>  <br>  Es tiempo de una oportunidad para tí. Siempre hay personas que nos pueden llenar física y mentalmente. No salgas deseperadamente a buscarlo, ten paciencia y escoge bien, no te equivoques.<br>  <br>  Debes vivir "tu camino de lágrimas".

Es normal como te sientes pero lo peor ya lo has pasado en estos 2 a?os y el dolor ira cediendo, vamos a ver como te organizas para seguir adelante con tus hijos. Lo primero es romper la comunicacion con el, solo tienes que hablar sobre tus hijos y lo minimo, nada de llorarle y de suplicarle asi que fuera la octava maravilla del mundo y un hombre que cuando Dios lo hizo rompio el molde. Exigele que cumpla con todas las pensiones que tiene que pagar, exigele todo y no cedas ni una, que ahi le das un palo en lo economico. A los chicos que los vea todo lo que sea posible, si se los lleva los fines de semana mejor, la OTRA se va a dar un tute a trabajar ,que no veas ,cuando le lleguen los tres juntos, otro palo porque los chicos son tuyos y a ella nada mas que le van a dan trabajo, no temas que te los quite ni que le tomen cari?o porque esto pocas veces sucede. Aprovecha ese tiempo que estas sin ni?os para salir con tus amigas, y de paso conoces gente, no te cierres a nada ahora eres una mujer libre, ahi le das otro palo al ex, tu puedes hacer lo que quieras y el no, porque ya tiene quien le controle. Cuidate todo lo que puedas una buena alimentacion, algo de gimnasia aunque sea en la casa, arreglate todo lo que puedas te sentiras mejor. Piensa todos los dias que tu con tus hijos eres una familia, tu familia, levantala y cuida de ella, tus hijos te necesitan, aprovecha este tiempo para estar con ellos y disfrutar de ellos, con el tiempo veran que eres una mujer valiente que en momentos duros planto cara a la vida, los ni?os se dan cuenta de todo. No mires hacia el pasado que ya no tiene remedio, mira por el dia a dia es lo unico que tenemos el pasado paso y el futuro aun no ha llegado. No hables mas de tu ex con nadie, asi sin hablar pensaras menos, daras menos explicaciones y sufriras menos. Pienso que eres una mujer bastante joven y tienes toda la vida por delante, no te culpes si amaste a este desgraciado y dieron con esta mujer tan perversa, tu vales mas ,que no te quepa la menor duda, no le dediques ni un mal pensamiento que no se lo merecen. Y no pienses si les va bien o mal , si a ella la quiere y a ti ya no, porque por lo que el sienta tu no eres ni mejor ni peor. Busca dentro de ti a tu yo, que ahora lo tienes desatendido, a esa personita que han da?ado tanto, y dite a ti misma que nunca mas, que tu vales mas que ellos, que vives sin el y que te va bien y cuando esto se cumpla ese es el mayor palo que le vas a dar a los dos te lo aseguro. Y no te preocupes por si el va a volver o no, tu a lo tuyo y si es que alguna vez vuelve entonces te planteas si quieres estar con el o ya no. Que Dios te bendiga.|`|qk7yczniaa	Quizas por lo que sientes o lo que el fue o es para ti no puedes entender nada...Primero se como te sientes pero te dire algo sincero.. espero me comprendas...

Yo entiendo y he vivido un amor grande y profundo como el tuyo, pero cuando ya no nos quieren aunque rueges y llores no vas a cambiar sus sentimientos. Lo que tu necesitas es ayuda sicologica porque lo tuyo es obsesion, son dos a?os de autoflagelarte, de llenar tu vida diciendote todos los dias " pobrecita de mi, la enga?ada, la dejada", ya basta. Si, si eres pobrecita, no porque el no te quiera sino porque no te quieres tu. Ya estas divorciada, ya no hay vuelta atras, el no va a regresar contigo nunca, ya ama a otra mujer, ya rehizo su vida y ahora te toca a ti hacer lo mismo. Si sigues con la misma actitud, ya ni a tus hijos va a ir a ver y ellos no tienen la culpa de nada, tus resentimietos se los vas a pasar a ellos y si tu ex es un buen padre tiene derecho al cari?o y a la compa?ia de tus hijos. Despierta, renace, eso ya se acabo y es hora de que sigas tu camino. Dios te ama y quiza por tu obstinacion no te has dado cuenta de que EL te abre mas puertas, siguelas, fluye, crece y se feliz.|`|6717d1ad4dcca56e83014a765d922f93aa	De verdad te rmerece el tipo ?<br>  Pobre de ti, seguro eres causante de parte de este problema por tener tan poca auto-estima.<br>  Piensas que ya se acabo, el mundo?<br>  Miralos a ellos, ya estan haciendo su vida sin importarles nada.....Seguro tu ex es un animal que no merece nada, pero tu deberias de aprender a quererte para sacar adelante a tus hijos sin la ayuda de quien los ha despreciado|`|7KQKrk7Caa	Con un infinito respeto a tu dolor y a tus hijos!!!...<br>  <br>  ...yo...estuve en la posicion de la otra!!<br>  <br>  Mira...si...de cualquier manera...estuvo mal lo que hizo! lo ideal huviera sido...que primero se divorciara, y luego se juntara con su actual pareja! pero...<br>  <br>  Me paso igual...<br>  <br>  un hombre con tres hijos!...una esposa! 6 a?os de novios y 8 de casados...<br>  <br>  que paso ahi? muchas veces...los seres humanos pensamos que el matrimonio es el paso que sigue despues de un noviazgo tan largo!... y no!!!<br>  <br>  Yo no sigo con el...pero..suponiendo que todo lo que me dijo huviera sido verdad...?que tal si el encontraron al amor de su vida? ?quieres que un hombre se quede contigo solo por "tantos a?os de matrimonio y tantos hijos"?<br>  <br>  Tu no fuiste un error!...le diste a sus hijos! pero todo en la vida es un ciclo, y el de tu matrimonio se cerro!!! mientras el sea un buen padre...creo que no te queda mucho por reclamarle!<br>  <br>  Si el salio con la mujer y tus hijos...?despues de dos a?os? no te parece que era algo que tarde o temprano iba a pasar?<br>  y no creas...podrias llegar a necesitar de ella!

Es mas pensaría que no merece mi perdón porque antepuso la cama con otra a su familia, dices que tienes 3 hijos, joder él no quiere a nadie, y a ti menos que a nadie cuando no dudo en irse con otra estando tu embarazada, pero qué puedes esperar de un hombre así, que mas prueba necesitas para darte cuenta de que solo piensa egoistamenete y con la bragueta, acaso si ma?ana volviera vas a perdonarlo como si nada hubiera pasado? vas a olvidar asi sin mas los malos ratos que has pasado mientra él se divertía, tu criando a tus hijos y el mientra pasandoselo de p. madre. No te enga?es a ti misma, él ya no es el hombre del que te enamoraste..., se asustó y salio uyendo, para que quieres un cobarde a tu lado? déjalo que viva su vida con esa mujer, y vive tu la tuya, ponte guapa y cómete el múndo, si no lo haces por ti que sea por tus hijos que no vean que su madre se enconde ante la vida por un desenga?o amoroso.

También se ven todos los dias por ser compa?eros de trabajo, ahora ya no salen, pero en unos días, él se va de casa y aunque me diga que es para pensar , yo se que va a volver a buscarla. Ahora tengo tanto miedo que me pase como a vos, de no poder dejar de amarlo, si te digo que yo vivia para mis hijos y ahora apenas si los atiendo, me siento perdida. Tengo a Dios en mi corazón, pero a veces la tristeza y la angustia me vencen, pero Dios siempre está a nuestro lado, solo que la lástima que sentimos por nosotras mismas no nos dejan verlo. Te lo digo a vos como me lo digo a mi, hay que salir adelante, dejar que el Se?or obre en nuestras vidas, en nuestra familia,ponernos en Sus Manos, quien más amoroso que él y más fiel. Una vez escuché que "Dios obra en forma misteriosa para llevar a cabo sus maravillas" y lo que a nosotros nos parece tan malo, tan dificil de sobrellevar, es porqué El tiene un propósito. Acercate a ?l y vas a ver que te dará consuelo. Dice Su Palabra que Dios no nos pone carga más pesada de la que podamos soportar. Es dificil tal vez entenderlo y dirás que hay que estar en tu lugar, a mi tambien me pasa cuando me dicen ponete bien,no vale la pena que sufras por el, pensá en tus hijos que te necesitan bien, que me da ganas de mandar a todos a la m....Pero bueno amiga luchá por lo que amas hasta el fin, aunque no veas ni un rayito de luz, de esperanza y si no es la voluntad de Dios que vuelva, sabelo Dios es justo y aunque nos duela El va a hacer pagar, más a ellas, por nuestras lágrimas.  Que Dios tenga misericordia de esas mujeres y de ellos también, yo no le deseo mal a nadie , es más oro siempre por ella para que se de cuenta que destruyó una familia, que tenía problemas, pero nunca hubo infidelidades en 11 a?os que estuvimos juntos,  que haciéndose la comprensiva enamoró a un hombre que se dejó llevar (tampoco él es inocente) por la sonrisita fácil, siempre dispuesta, siempre contenta, claro, ella no lidia con los chicos, con la casa, con el dinero que no alcanza, debe estar siempre linda, arreglada , y eso los hace olvidar de los problemas.No te conozco pero me siento hermanada por tu dolor.

Y pidele a Dios y a Jesucristo que te den fortaleza de espiritu que te ayuden en ese sufrimiento que padeces, ya que ese sufrimiento no viene de Dios sino del otro que te quiere ver así y tu no debes de permitirlo...Ponle tu cruz a Jesucristo para que la cargue y ten por seguro que él lo hará por tí...abre tu corazón de nuevo a otro amor que si te merezca...no pierdas más tus energias en alguien que no se lo merece..Así que borrón y cuenta nueva. <br>  <br>  Besitos y te envio energías positivas..Alisha

fd1d3bb075f720828893a7739af3ce0baa	I think you need to create a log of all these things he does at home. It would seem that he would also be displaying the same actions at school and the school would be very active with you and set up some testing... but you didnt state that.<br>  <br>  Take the log and discuss this with his PCP. You need to get him some counseling and also PCP can see if there is any other medical or underlying problems.|`|ebf08046e6120568bc70e0a69a64d0aeaa	It sounds to me like you need to take control of the situation and show him who the boss is.

I really recommend that you get some professional help. The downside to that is that 9 out of 10 doctors result to medication. I am against that and recommend that you find a doctor that will work with him on a one on one basis.<br>  <br>  If you do not have the resources to try that approach try the give and take method. I would take away everything (no extracurricular activities) and he has to earn everything.<br>  <br>  In the beginning this will seem like to much to bare. After a few weeks the child will break and you will start to see improvements.  The key to this method is consistency. <br>  <br>  I hope that my answer was of some help to you.<br>  <br>  Take care.

Well, there are a few things to consider. How close is he to his cousin?  How close are the families involved? Would your baby know this man as a family member or are they distant enough that it wouldn't come up at family gatherings? Of course the most important thing is whether or not you feel comfortable with it.|`|JJ92thVeaa	/ If you want to keep seeing him, there is nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  Remember, he is not your baby's father, and everyone is different.<br>  <br>  Yes he is family - related, but that doesn't mean anything negative.  They would all be your family anyway (if you stayed together), so you will still be distanced from your baby's father.<br>  <br>  Actually, it's nice not to lose relatives who probably love you already.|`|e90308c65016d9a33d2a1319552b19b8aa	well, I suppose it's a way of keeping in the family!<br>  But I'd feel weird about it too|`|ti3Q3eLqaa	Ofcourse you can!<br>  its nothing to do with the father of your baby.<br>  as long as you know what your doing, the best for you and your child.<br>  good luck.<br>  xxx|`|2gnB1qhsaa	In this particular case, Just because you have not seen the baby daddy in two years doesn't means you go with the cousin their still family no matter what.

If you have not seen the father in 2 years then he is out of the picture anyway and you have the right to be happy.  If the cousin doesn't have a problem with it and you are happy with him then date him.  All that should really matter is if you enjoy being with him, does he accept your child, and is he respectable and kind to both you and your child.|`|yqE1OXMvaa	First class ticket to the Jerry Springer show.

Cuídate ok<br>  <br>  Saludos, besos, y muchos abrazos quiebra huesitos|`|DNtlgjkbaa	en realidad no, pero si he comenzado nuevas amistades|`|Kkv6ArIYaa	bueno..si..a mi si me ha pasado...primero me usto por la foto y luego por la manera  de ser...y ahora somos muy buenos amigos a distancia desde hace dos anos....<br>  <br>  eso sucede!|`|PVAUnO6Vaa	Si, casi todos los contactos de mi messenger están ahí porque ya confiaba en que eran personas con las que me gustaría conversar; si con alguien me equivoco, antes de media hora queda fuera de mi lista de amigos y bloqueado su acceso al messenger; no estoy para perder el tiempo dando oportunidades a quien ya empieza mal.|`|VVZWYxQCaa	si obio q es posible<br>  <br>  saludos y q descanses<br>  <br>  buenas noches|`|aKgkwO0Kaa	chama pero no seas tan ingenua!!!|`|eYsfSVDEaa	sii la primera vez que hable por msn con un chico que no conocia<br>  pero despues pense que la mayoria de las personas tratan de dar otra personalidad ya que uno no las conoce|`|qEmTpjF6aa	Sí, si me ha llegado a gustar alguien... y yo también gusto. Es diferente gustarse que pretender una relación sería y formal en 30 minutos... Yo entiendo tu pregunta como el hecho en sí de gustarse y sentir atracción hacía esa persona. Deseos de conocerla más, pues de lo contrario no volverías a hablar con ella...<br>  <br>  Hace poco tiempo que yo chateo, pero siempre simpatizo y no todos me simpatizan a mí... Es importante tener claras algunas ideas a la hora de estar en el chat, pero si eres sincera y madura, puedes llevar las cosas bien...<br>  <br>  Y es facil darse cuenta cuándo una persona te miente y cuándo no... No necesitas estar detrás de un ordenador para darte cuenta de que siempre pretendemos aparentar lo que no somos, los mentirosos mienten de frente y detrás, eso es un hecho... espero que valga mi aportación...<br>  P.D. No creo que lo que se conoce por internet sea suficiente para una relación estable....|`|ruLsWIY7aa	si mucho, pero con 1 hora casi k me basta para ver k lo k me gusta es la imagen k yo me invento de esa persona, las cosas nunca son lo k parece en la mayoria de los casos.<br>  <br>  Con 30 minutos mas, te das cuenta k todos en mayoria van a lo k van. Si no te lo cres es solo calientr un poko las frases y ya vera k pasa, se avalanchan como unos hambrientos  encima  de la carne jjajajajaj<br>  <br>  experiencia propia|`|t9Bcum8Kaa	si pero no fue nada bueno, nunca es lo que parece y siempre es mala la primera impresion.|`|uJJAsYyhaa	no creo q me des la mejor respuesta.pero<br>  pasar pasa,pero el asunto esta en  si confias<br>  como para hacer eso<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos|`|01f2595edfe66a380f33cdc9e58a5551aa	Si, varias veces y no hablo de "amor" sino que me ha gustado su forma de hablar, sus conceptos, su buena onda... en fin, he conocido gente maravillosa gracias a la compu...<br>  Besos.|`|7ZmkL8Tpaa	No converso por la compu'.

Si queres saber algo de quien esta detras de un equipo deberás ir formandote un concepto e imagen, solo a traves de lo conversado y asi es como tambien podes sufrir desencantos, porque no era lo que querías o pretendias. En lo personal te digo que hay seres que he tenido contacto a traves de la red y despues de un tiempo hemos terminado con una muy buena amistad porque he notado que siente y tiene los mismos gustos, preferencias y nivel cultural que yo para poder conversar tranquilamente. Con algunos, ya nos conocemos personalmente, con otros en via de concretarse. Por suerte, no me he sentido defraudado. Hemos comprobado que somos lo mismo que hicimos y dijimos a traves de un chat. Por eso siento mucha satisfacción. Querida Ximena: te mando un fuerte abrazo  y mi imvariabl?e cari?o de siempre. TKM. Manuel Carlos, Argentina.
ko5sa2YFaa	A mi una buena amiga me ense?o hace poco una hermosa lección de amistad y también lo mucho que quiero a esta amiga mia.<br>  Pondré el ejemplo de lo que es para mi respecto a ella:<br>  actitudes, sentimientos y valores: saber que un/a amigo/a esta siempre para lo que necesites de el/la pero es reciproco por lo que a esa persona también la tienes que mimar. Saber que se convierten en parte de tu familia. Y... jajajaja como dices tu Xime, hay que darle de comer de vez en cuando algún bombón de chocolate. Saber que quieres día a día que puedas saber como estará esa persona y que siempre le desees lo mejor y que sepas que cuando le duel algo te duele a ti también. Saber que deseas estar comprometido por ti mismo a mantener esa amistad sin conocer límite de tiempo y/pero intentar que no se acabe nunca. Saber que quieres ver a esa persona sonreir. Saber que quieres contarle cosas de ti y que quieres saber siempre cosas de esa otra persona hasta aunque haya tenido cualquiera de las dos partes el día más aburrido de su historia. Yo quiero ver a mi amiga aún estando en la lejania aunque sea en dibujos y diría todos los días lo wapa que esta aunque solo la viese diariamente en avantares de yahoo jajaja.<br>  Xime, estas preciosa hoy y que avantar más bonito;):D<br>  Bueno, realmente no se que más escribir porque en realidad creo que la verdadera amistad es muy interminable para narrar ya que es una cosa tan especial que hay que sentir y cuando la sientes de corazón sobran las palabras.|`|56KGl7Yqaa	las actitudes son los comportamientos de la persona hacia el amigo pueden ser buenas o malas<br>  Los sentimientos los rige el corazón como el amor hacia el amigo<br>  los valores son la fidelidad, la nobleza, la lealtad  y  otros mas, para construir una amistad se deben procurar solidas bases donde prevalezca el respeto, la tolerancia y la confianza y como mantenerla ?regándola diariamente de ternura y de reciprocidad de sentimientos|`|D7wVrzmxaa	cari?o,  honestidad y respeto son los pilares para una relación, sea lejana o cercana, sin estos, nada es posible corazón....|`|PVAUnO6Vaa	Sinceridad, lealtad, empatía, tolerancia, respeto y mucho amor.|`|S0M0mgkEaa	todas  si tienes buenos valores y buenos sentimientos pero no sabes como expresarlos por no tener buenas actitudes no puedes llegar a nada , si tienes buenas actitudes y buenos pero sin sentimiento serias como un robot y si tienes buenas actirudes y sentimientos sin valores no llegas a nada  piensalo|`|sdz220Bnaa	Confianza, sinceridad, Apoyo incondicional, No traicionar a esa persona ni hablar de ella a sus espaldas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080229150542AAmeZTB&r=w">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  Contesten!!|`|7ZmkL8Tpaa	Además de los que has dicho, la honradez, amor, simpatía, empatía, entrega y sacrificio|`|JZziDc3Faa	Hola! honestidad,humor y mucha comprension!|`|ff17a34b1a1578e45384615025098ca0aa	Me gustaría mucho ser amigo de todas las personas que no mientan,yó nunca miento (aunque quizás no lo crean) por lo que la verdad es la única cosa que necesito para entregar mis sentimientos a una amistad incondicional.Saludos|`|jIuRen5raa	La confianza, la lealtad,  fidelidad, amor, y constancia.<br>  saludos besos, bye|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	hola ximena mi saludos amiga mira  yo pienso  que los valores es la pieza fundamental en la amistad y de la vida<br>  si no hay eso pues no existe nada  es un sentimiento que<br>  da el valor para mantener y contruir los valores de la vida.<br>  esa es mi forma de pensar..<br>  de alli  pues ya viene todo   alli se arma el ronpecabeza<br>  porque teniendo eso lo tienes todo.<br>  posees las virtudes de la vida..|`|yjLZXpN1aa	lealtad y ganas amiga de ambas partes para cultivarla siempre<br>  muackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk<br>  miles de besos y buenas noches|`|1dcfbd63791523ad61901338334ac5f3aa	solo necesitas lealtad mutua<br>  <br>  Atte el sin amigos|`|1qevTCr7aa	Como dicen por ahi... Las relaciones sentimentales (en eso se inclue la amistad) son como una plantita para que se mantenga hay que cuidarla.. Asi que para mantener a un amigo sencillamente se tu misma, respetalo, cuidalo, apoyalo y siempre esta a tu lado.<br>  Cuando creas que tienes un verdadero amigo, cuidalo mucho porque es muy dificil hallarlo|`|QrQuR0OXaa	el respeto, la lealtad, no hipocrecia, y sobre todo ser alegre en la vida|`|VVZWYxQCaa	hola ,xibe XD.<br>  <br>  <br>  en mi probecita y humilde opinion=)<br>  <br>  esas palabras ,no cuentan ,capaz esto te ofende<br>  pero ,es lo q pienso.<br>  <br>  <br>  solo tiene q tener las cosas q a vos te agraden<br>  en mi opinion,ni muchas ni pokas solo las de mi gusto=).<br>  <br>  <br>  solo digamos q la amistad es respeto mutuo<br>  y el respeto se gana con gestos y los gestos<br>  adecuados se describen en las palabras q vos escribiste.<br>  <br>  <br>  xibe ,te mando saludos y abrasos<br>  <br>  buenas noches|`|izTj1XKUaa	bienvenida nuevamente xime, son cualidades que tenemos y que debemos reflejarlas de la mejor manera, eso hace que seamos capaces de amar bastante, <br>  p.d. echale ganas a todo lo referente a tu salud. desde aqui te echo porras ?????arriba, arriba, xime, tu puedes!!!|`|tWJREF0haa	Lealtad, honestidad, sinceridad, amor, paciencia, todo tiene que estar en armonía con tus hechos, con tus palabras y con la amistad que queréis conservar para siempre<br>  Abrazos Guapa|`|thjJGZLzaa	Buenos sentimientos, símpatía, conexion quimica, eso es lo que tienen mis relaciones. <br>  Fidelidad y respeto.|`|yX7cZ8p8aa	Como la amistad no se compra, ella depende las actitudes que cada uno tomemos frente a ella. La verdadera amistad consiste em estar cuando los otros se han ido. Brindar el hombro, un  pa?uelo, participar de sus desventuras y tambien de sus alegrias. Si cada uno es consecuente con el otro, no siente intereses economicos con esa amistad, no desea que le ocurra algo para obtener réditos, entonces podemos hablar de amistad sincera. Caso contrario estariamos frente a unos aprovechadores que salen a dar lástima, ya que son incapaces de conseguir cosas por otro medio. Usan la amistad para salir de su mediocre forma. En definitiva Ximena, amigo es el desinteresado, leal, sincero, que esta a tu lado que esta a tu lado por respeto, amor, consecuencia, y cuando mas lo necesitas.En los momentos de lagrimas, de desesperacion, de desesperanza. Eso si son amigos. Los otros ni valen tenerlos en cuenta. Recibe un abrazo, las seguridades de mi permanente amor, porque te valoro por lo que sos no porque lo que tenes. Manuel Carlos, Argentina.

José... En fín... Raro ?? No para nada... antes te felicito porque de esta manera evitaste muchas cosas... los 15 a?os son para disfrutarlos como adolescentes-con amigos- Para qué mortificarse con novias a esa edad si aun somos ni?os a los 15... ... ... Tendríamos el tiempo controlado, es un lio salir con otras personas... ... ... en fin... Realmente evitaste muchas cosas... cuantos jovenes no son padres a esta edad ??? Para mí todo tiene su momento... y, los 15 no son un buen momento... Mi primer novio y el unico que he tenido con el cual llevo mas de 4 a?os lo tuve casi cumpliendo 18... ya estaba en la universidad cuando eso !!! imaginate... todas mis amigas se burlaban por estar sola... en fin... ellas ahora no tienen una carrera y son madres solteras...

Como te dije todo en la vida tiene un tiempo...<br>  Exitos !!!|`|dHN1uOUcaa	claro que no eres anormal, ni homosexual ni nada, simplemente, no estabas preparado, o no se dio el momento ni la situacion.<br>  <br>  o simplemente no apareció la chica indicada para ti.|`|iYc3sB1xaa	es normal ntp!!!
3STpoxm3aa	Bueno Luis, he de decirte que es normal que despues de enamorarte de una chica ya no te parezca ninguna mejor que ella, pero te lo digo yo que la hay...si no ha podido ser con esa chica es porque esa no era tu chica y el destino la tiene preparada aun para ti, una chica que te parezca la mas linda del universoo...<br>  <br>  Todo lo que te pasa dejara de pasarte con el tiempo...ya dicen que el tiempo lo cura todo, pues es bien cierto<br>  <br>  Por otra parte tambien esta la posibilidad de que la chica esta que te tiene enamorado te conozca y puedan estar juntos.<br>  <br>  Pero ya te digo, el tiempo pone a cada uno o a cada cosa en su lugar, espera que toda espera tiene su recompensa|`|FhsUBhWZaa	hola yo creo q no deberias hacer por una parte pq ella no fue nada tuyo y por otra pq nada es igual!!!!y lo q tienes q hacer es a una chica q te guste conocerla como es ella mismo y no comparar?la con la otra y conocer sus virtudes y poco a poco te olvidaras de ella|`|XXbO3Advaa	se que es dificil pero.......... dios sabe lo q hace asi q no te preocupes q si le das tiempo al tiempo y pruebas con otras chicas el amor se dara.!! el destino te lo agradesera y tu mismo!<br>  --------------------------> beshos cuidate!(K)|`|iR3US8itaa	simplemente es cuestion de que te decidas a terminar con esto no exiete otra salida mas que tu te propongas dejar de pensar en ella por que si para todo lo que haces la recuerdas nunca la vas a aolvidar asi que si ves a otra mujer avientate no tienes nada que perder  cada mujer es diferente y pude ser que tu en tus momentos de locura no te fiejes que estas perdiendo muchas oportunidades y momentos felices|`|eGNLeWkyaa	BUSCALA!!!!!!!!!!!!! y sacate la espina,mira.......ubicala primero y empieza a enamorarla, haste pasar como un admirador secreto, dejale notitas, enviarle un regalito de repente, dale un mail para que se comunique contigo, mandale mensajitos, etc.... y con eso te aseguro que cae por que cae a las mujeres les encantan los detalles y que las hagas sentir como princesas.<br>  Hechale ganas y nunca te quedes con eso adentro, hazles saber que les gustas y se un caballero para tratarlas.|`|3150ae6c6cf7dad7284df416927a2fd3aa	NO PUES ESPERA A QUE SE TE PASE EL ENAMORAMIENTO PERO SI NO SALES CON OTRAS ESO VA A TARDAR MAS...|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	mi consejo es:Bueno Luis, he de decirte que es normal que despues de enamorarte de una chica ya no te parezca ninguna mejor que ella, pero te lo digo yo que la hay...si no ha podido ser con esa chica es porque esa no era tu chica y el destino la tiene preparada aun para ti, una chica que te parezca la mas linda del universoo...<br>  recuerda que la chica  debe por el destino y eso sera para porque estapreparada para ti....<br>  saludos amigo

U0lLfp6xaa	Liderazgo. La velocidad que establece el líder determina el paso del grupo.<br>  Objetivos. Nadie sabe que tan alto puede volar, tu mismo no tendrás noción hasta que te atrevas a extender tus alas.<br>  éxito. El éxito es un viaje, no un destino.<br>  Orgullo. El orgullo es un compromiso personal, es una actitud que separa a la excelencia de la mediocridad.<br>  Determinación. La carrera no siempre la ganan los más veloces sino aquellos que siguen corriendo.<br>  Actitud. La actitud es algo peque?o que hace una gran diferencia.<br>  Calidad. La carrera por la calidad no tiene línea de meta.<br>  <br>  Esta es muy buena; es una experiencia que le paso a un amigo, decidi expresarla dandole toques magicos de expresion muy buena.<br>  Un joven turista se encontraba en las playas de Cancún y era la primera vez que subiría en un paracaídas jalado por una lancha. Si conoces la playa, sabes que los lancheros prestan ese servicio, que consiste en que un paracaídas es amarrado por una cuerda a una lancha. <br>  Entonces, la lancha inicia su recorrido mar adentro, con el turista sujeto al paracaídas con un arnés. Este corre con el paracaídas en la playa por unos instantes, hasta el momento en que el turista despega los pies del suelo, el paracaídas se eleva hasta el cielo y la persona junto con el.<br>  Imagínate, el joven no sabía nadar y tenía las siguientes preguntas en su cabeza:<br>  ?Qué pasará si la lancha me arrastra mar adentro, antes de que me eleve el paracaídas?<br>  ?Qué tal si una vez en el cielo, me caigo de semejante altura?<br>  A pesar del miedo, decidió actuar y confiar en la incertidumbre. Sabía que era una experiencia nueva y era natural tener miedo. Pero también sabía que la vida es eso, experiencias nuevas y que tenía que estar abierto ante la vida.<br>  Se puso el arnés. Escuchó con nerviosismo las últimas indicaciones del instructor. “Ruuuuuum” se escuchó el sonido del motor de la lancha que iniciaba su recorrido al mar. El joven comenzó a caminar al principio y después a correr a medida que la velocidad aumentaba.<br>  Y llegó el momento en que tuvo que pegar un salto para evitar caer al mar “?Guuuuuaaaaaauuuuuu!” no lo podía creer, el paracaídas se elevó y en cuestión de segundos, estaba a muchos metros encima, viendo el mar y los hoteles de la ciudad, como si fueran casas de juguete. Y sintió paz.<br>  “Qué emocionante, nunca me hubiera imaginado que sería tan fácil y divertido” y disfrutó de la hermosa vista desde el cielo.<br>  ?Qué podemos aprender de este joven? Es natural tener miedo ante lo desconocido. La imaginación crea mil y un fantasmas pero son eso. Fantasmas. No existen en realidad y son auto-creados.<br>  Mi pregunta es: ?Cuántos de nosotros evitamos tener experiencias nuevas por temor a lo desconocido?<br>  Aún más fuerte: ?Cuántos miedos imaginarios has acumulado durante tu vida, que te han evitado experimentar cosas nuevas y ser feliz?<br>  “Muchos sinsabores he tenido en la vida, la mayoría de los cuales nunca me han ocurrido”. Exacto.

Yo creo que si uno estuvo muy enamorado en su momento de su actual esposa y la relación se desarrolló bien como para decidir fomar una familia con ella, no habría razón para dejarla. <br>  Pero, sin embargo, por algo existen los divorcios. Y sobre lo segundo que decís, yo creo q puede tener mucho de verdad. Somos seres humanos, y la monotonía, la rutina en la vida puede ser algo fatal para todos. Más, si la persona con la que estamos al lado, de repente o con el tiempo cambia y la relación pasa transformarse en algo inconvivible. Claro que no se podría descartar que en una pareja si algo no resulta, y más después de una relación tan durarera, es consecuencia de ambos. <br>  En fin, y en cuanto a los hijos, es otro tema. Las parejas se pueden separar, divorciar, volverse a casar, etc., todos tienen derecho a rehacer su vida. Pero la relación padres e hijos nunca se puede desvincular, es una responsabilidad. Y nunca se deben dejar de tener en cuenta. <br>  Sin hacer incapié en lo legal, sino resaltando en lo emocional; por uno mismo y por ellos !. <br>  Saludos!|`|AdYkltBFaa	No puedo generalizar, necesito estar en ese momento.<br>  Pero yo te ridia q lo de la cara larga no importa un pedo, si queres a la chica, ya la conoces y sabes porq esta asi (bueno la mayoria de las veces).<br>  <br>  Los matrimonios se deshacen por 2 principales causas segun mi punto de vista:<br>  1) - Era pura pasion y despues de "comer del fruto" varias veces, te cansa el mismo sabor<br>  2) - Ella nos mostro una cara falsa de su forma de ser, y nos casamos con una desconocida.|`|QZfF5Fqyaa	Sin lugar a dudas es mejor luchar siempre por la primera relacion. Cuando uno la salva, o la pareja la salva, se dan cuenta que ese es el verdadero amor, el que se compromete y no se basa en las emociones. El enamoramiento (romance, tipo pelicula) es emocion, pero el amor verdadero es decision y aceptacion.  Un hombre que deja a su esposa por otra, dejara a la otra por una mas. Es como los matones, lo mas dificil es matar al primero, los demas son mas faciles. Dios honra a las parejas, que a pesar de todo, deciden amarse.  El hombre que deja a su esposa por la amante, es porque no se fajo los pantalones. Lo demas son solo pretextos.|`|RLpPBYPraa	Caray intentaria devolverle la vida a mi mujer, el animo, aquello de lo que me enamore.<br>  <br>  Una mas joven no, cuando pase el tiempo, yo estare anciano y ella todavia seria una mujer plena, lo mas probable entonces esque me quedaria solo.<br>  <br>  Jajaja y si fuera una esposa como tu =P, con mas razon intento salvar la relacion jajaja.<br>  <br>  Saludos y dios te bendiga mini.|`|hfnx0eIeaa	Pues comiencen de nuevo.

dZlBwUH9aa	talk to her.it may be hard but do it.I've got a thing for a shy guy and he's got a thing for me and if he would just talk to me I'd never be sad again.just pretend that you're someone else.and keep in mind that however shy you maybe girls a lot of times are even more so.seriously you'll regret it if you don't.you'll kick yourself later.just talk to her and smile at her (if your even a little attractive that's  half the work) everyone likes to be liked.the worst thing that can happen is that she might not like you but at least you'd know.not knowing is worse.and besides maybe it would help you with your shyness .it's important to be an active participant in your life and this is a step towards that.i hope she likes you (she probably does and you just don't know it) good luck!|`|SS1VReF0aa	Nut up|`|6edW8IYEaa	be very patient (never works) or just lose the shyness for a few seconds and spark a conversation.
wQTMOT9naa	mira para empezar los problemas para los adolecentes son normales, y como tu eres la hermana mayor, tu madre c va a refugiar en tu hermana, xq siente ke perdio una hija aunke tu todavia la kieras, y eso de los hermanos menores asi es lo ke debes de hacer es molestarla de regreso (no insultarla o gritarle) y a los papas ay ke tenerles paciencia a mi talves c me este haciendo facil xq mis papas saben ke mi hermano no es un santito, y no creas ke tu mama tiene preferencias xq no las tiene, las madres deben de amar a sus hijos siempre, no hay razon para dejar de amarlos, y talves les dice ke eres mala hija, para ke tus hermanos no sean como tu TODAVIA ya ke algun dia lo seran, todas las familias pasan por muxos obstaculos cuando hay un adolecente en la ksa, t lo digo ya ke tengo 16, pero eso no importa y no escuches a tu hermano, (lo dice para enojarte o molestarte) y ademas debes ponerte pilas con tus hermanos ya ke son los hermanos mayores los ke debemos mandar jajajaja (no todo claramente) pero  las mamas son asi, empieza con hablar con ella, (mas de lo comun) ya ke muxos padres c kejan de ke sus hijos ya no hablan con ellos como usalmente lo hacian pero no te preocupes, eso c pasa (espero) jajaja ya ke a mi me tratan mas o menos igual pero todo c arregla<br>  <br>  <br>  SUERTE CON TU FAMILIA|`|2603f402cc19794ad1215e8e1851bef8aa	Trata de conseguir un trabajo, y renta una casita, no te preocupes por los muebles, solo ocupa la cama y la comida la compras en las esquinas en los taquitos, es importante que esto quebrantara la familia, pero aveces es necesario un respiro, tal vez despues te busquen, te pidan perdon y te pidan que regreses|`|9ej8MrYmaa	No estas sola, a todos nos pasan este tipo de cosas, a mi con mi hermana peque?a me pasa exactamnte lo mismo, me molesta y si le digo que me deje en paz ya se enfadan, el caso ha llegado a un límite tal que mi ermana, al menor "no" que le doy, me amenaza con decírselo a mamá... y me da impotencia... Yo te aconsejo, como estoy haciendo yo, si tienes la posibilidad de hablar con alguien de confianza que te comprenda y te apoye, acudas a esa persona, si es adulto mejor; yo hago eso, hablo con la prima de mi madre, ke a pesar de tener su misma edad es mucho más comprensiva; le cuento todo lo que me pasa y ella habla con mi madre y todo, a lo mejor si alguien habla con ella, usando la "psicología" el asunto cambia un poco, te deseo suerte.|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	para los adolecentes los problemas son muy normal yo fui adolecente y hubieras visto como  me trataban asi era yo <br>  verdad: pero eso no significa que no te quieran ellos te aman  y desean lo mejor para ti..<br>  trata de llevarte  lo mas mejor con tu familia porque es la<br>  que te apoya en todas las cosas buenas.<br>  de la vida..y recuerda que la cosa mejores vendran ya que todo pase  pero tu debes de portarte bien...<br>  eso mientras pasa tu adolecencia todo te parecera que no sirve incluyendo a tu madre y a tu padre y hermanos tios, tias.<br>  y asta tus amigos y amigas....|`|2cpiIcoqaa	Amiga es un problema q no se puede solucionar d la noche ala ma?ana, ten paciencia en ti, no trates d hacer stupidecs, puesdes salir d tu casa a der una buelta cuando t sten molestando tus hermanos, y en cuanto a tu madre ps solo ignorala en algunas ocasiones.<br>  No t digo q t vallas a d tu casa ps has  d ser menor, puedes investigas centro d tratamiento familiar, puedes ir tu sola o  con tu familia. Espero q se solucionen los problemas en tu csa un beso cuidat mucho.|`|99d38ba83529a549a4ecdbeb7feabc03aa	Hola Rochuuu:<br>  <br>  Si en algun momento de mi vida senti deseos de ser una varita magica y volar como una paloma, te diria que la primera visita que haria seria a tu casa, y con la varita tocarte para convertirte en poderosa, amorosa, exitosa, valiente, honesta, reponsable, segura de ti misma, con una autoestima bien alta, feliz, llena de luz espiritual.  Imaginate, todo lo que en este momento que te estoy escribiendo yo haria por ti.<br>  <br>  Igual pienso si se pudiera hacer todo eso a traves de la distancia, tu en tu pais y yo en mi pais.  <br>  Yo se que para Dios nada es imposible, en El todo se puede si quieres creer.  <br>  Si esto te puede servir de algo espero lo reflexiones.  Cuando uno esta en plena adolesencia todo lo siente como si estuviera enredado, nada tiene solucion, deseamos tenerlo todo a la misma vez. Se piensa que el mundo es unicamente de uno, es una etapa donde no se esta definido como persona como ser humano, pensamos que nadie nos quiere,.  Los sentimientos y las emociones no estan de un todo claras.<br>  <br>  Es una etapa dificil y dolorosa, confusa, pensamos que nadie nos comprende, y llega un momento que no sabemos a donde o a quien acudir para pedir ayuda. <br>  No se en que edad tienes, pero me hace sentido que obviamente eres menor de edad, para tomar decisiones que todavia estan en custodia de tus padres.  Por lo tanto no soy quien para decirte que cosa debes hacer.<br>  Lo mas que puedo decirte es que trates de conversar con tu hermana, tu mama, y dejalos que ellos hablen y expongan sus ideas de como se sienten con las relaciones como familia, escuchalos primero a ellos y luego expones tu sentir, pideles que te den la oportunidad de cambiar para que la armonia entre todos prevalesca. Hazlo con respeto, sin alterarte, porque tal vez ellos no entienden que estas en un proceso de adolecensia, pero eso no quita el que tu pongas de tu parte.<br>  Comparte tareas con ellos, ofreceles ayuda, no esperes qe te digan lo que tienes que hacer porque tu enteindes que es tu responsabilidad aportar algo en bien del hogar. y eso lo debes comprender, tal ves ellos se sienten que no estas dando gran parte de ti como miembro de la familia que vive tambien bajo el mismo techo, debes ser un poco comprensible en eso. Ta vez si lo haces entonces cambiaran su atitud contigo.  Acuerdate, hay que dar para recibir, y al adolecente le gusta que le den sin dar nada a cambio. Intentalo y veras el cambio aunque sea un poquito, pero eso te da la senal de que tu puedes.<br>  Acuerdate, NOSOTROS TENEMOS PODER PARA CAMBIAR LAS COSAS CON JUSTICIA, EN PAZ.<br>  Que Dios te cuide, y te bendiga,<br>  Ofelia|`|Q1ORCHnhaa	Creo que lo primero que debés de hacer es revisar tus aptitudes en el entorno familiar,cómo te comportas con cada uno de ellos,cuánto cooperas en la casa,qué tán carinosa eres con tus padres y hermanos,el papel de victima es muy cómodo,.....pero una auto evaluación te vendría muy bién para que cambiés en lo que considerés necesario y no estar esperando que sea ellos los que cambien con vos......dá el primer paso y las cosas serán más fáciles.|`|QEbc3hywaa	mira mi atormentad amiga yo tube un caso similar de que querian mas a mi hermano que ami y me pso lo

pasamos por esos malos momentos, lo que debes hacer para no pelear con tus hermanos y padres es hablar con tus papás y diles que quieres tomar un curso de pintura, aperender a tocar un instrumento, aprender a bailar, o algo por el estilo que te distraiga un poco y te permita salir de tu casa, para que te distraigas y ellos vean que estas cambiando, aprende a guardar silencia e ignora a tus hermanos que te molestan.<br>  <br>  con el tiempo tus padres al ver tu seriedad y que guardas silencio se acercarán a preguntarte que te sucede y será el momento ideal para platicar lo qe sucede.<br>  <br>  yo tambien tengo hermanos que me fastidian, pero ya no les hago caso, y tambien me rega?aban mis papás porque veían que me peleaba con el, jiji, pero luego ya no hice caso y me respetan ahora.<br>  <br>  suerte.|`|45Akxpjuaa	Lo primero que debes hacer,  es ser lo mas honesta e imparcial con tigo misma, es decir, analízate objetivamente, mira primero en ti, en tu comportamiento, tu personalidad, tal ves eres mas exigente que antes y no te has dado cuenta y ahora estas requiriendo mas atención de la que te dan y todo a tu al rededor te molesta tanto que a la menor provocación o conversación  lo tomas a mal y estas agobiando a tu familia.<br>  <br>  Si eres sincera con tigo misma,  podrás ver las cosas mas claras, tienes que ser fuerte, no juzgues a la ligera, no respondas sin pensar las consecuencias, no seas tan impulsiva.<br>  <br>  Yo pase por la adolescencia, no me fue muy traumática aunque uno de mis hermanos a veces me quería hacer la vida imposible, peleábamos mucho y a cada rato estábamos castigados porque el uno al otro no nos dejábamos en paz, pero un buen día decidimos en común acuerdo no pelear mas y ser los mejores amigos, de eso ya han pasado mas de 30 a?os y seguimos siendo los mejores amigos que puedas imaginar, tengo tres hermanos mas pero, con ese que tanto re?ía se convirtió en mi mejor amigo.<br>  <br>  Deposita tu FE en DIOS, reza para que llegue paz a tu alma, tengas claridad en tus pensamientos, estoy seguro que tu familia te ama mucho, pero tienes que ser lo suficientemente valiente para reconocer tus errores para que ellos reconozcan los suyos y puedas de una ves por todas salir de predicamento tan doloroso en el que te encuentras.......ten FE<br>  <br>  <br>  Atentamente, te invito a que visites cualquiera de los

Quedan incluidos en esta categoría, los sitios destinados a recibir o almacenar artefactos, instrumentos o utensilios, materiales y materias primas que se emplean en las tareas o faenas y todos los anexos y dependencias de la fábrica o taller. <br>  <br>  Se considerará, asimismo, como establecimientos industriales, para todos los efectos legales, las estaciones de autobuses y de transporte de carga. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 2°: En todos aquellos casos en que estas normas aluden al Ministerio, se entenderá que se trata del Ministerio de Salud. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 3°: Los establecimientos industriales se clasifican en: a.   Inofensivos; b. Incómodos; Insalubres; y d.   Peligrosos. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 4°: Se consideran como inofensivos los establecimientos industriales que no causen ni puedan causar da?os o molestias al vecindario o a las personas que en ellos trabajan. Se estimará, particularmente, como fuente de eventuales molestias el número de trabajadores, si con él se altera significativa- mente la afluencia de personas al sector y el tránsito de vehículos. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 5°: Se consideran incómodos los establecimientos industria- les que sin ser insalubres ni peligrosos, generan molestias manifiestas al vecindario o a las personas que en ellos trabajan, por ruidos, trepidaciones, humo, malos olores, cambios sensibles de temperatura, luces, polvo, gases, humedad u otros inconvenientes. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 6°: Son incómodos por sonido cuando estos se perciban en el interior de las habitaciones vecinas con una intensidad mayor de sesenta y cinco decibeles (A), desde las seis hasta las dieciocho horas y mayor de cuarenta decibeles (A) en las restantes doce horas. La División de saneamiento Ambiental del Ministerio de Salud, establecerá los procedimientos de acuerdo a las normas establecidas para efectuar las pruebas de medición en el momento en que estime conveniente. <br>  <br>  (Así reformado mediante Decreto N' 18209-S de 23 de junio de 1988) <br>  <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 7°: Se entiende que existe incomodidad por trepidaciones; cuando éstas se transmiten en forma molesta, a juicio del Ministerio, a las habitaciones vecinas. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 8°: La incomodidad por cambios sensibles de temperatura, provendrá de modificaciones de la temperatura en habitaciones vecinas superiores o inferiores a dos grados centígrados. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 9°: Los establecimientos son incómodos por luces cuando éstas siendo constantes o intermitentes, iluminan el interior de las habitaciones vecinas.<br>  <br>  ARTICULO 10°: Se entenderá que existe incomodidad por polvo, chispas, humo o vapores, cuando estos elementos penetren en las habitaciones vecinas o ensucian muros o techos. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 11°: Se considerará que existe incomodidad por olores, cuando estos invaden las habitaciones vecinas. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 12°: Se entiende por insalubres los establecimientos industriales que, por la naturaleza de los trabajos que en ellos se desarrollan o las condiciones en que se realizan, puedan originar efectos capaces de amenazar o da?ar la salud de los trabajadores o del vecindario, debido a los materiales empleados, elaborados, desprendidos o desechos. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 13°: Se considerarán peligrosas las industrias que da?en o puedan da?ar de modo inmediato y grave la vida de los trabajadores que ellas laboran o al vecindario, ya sea por la naturaleza de sus faenas o de los materiales empleados, elaborados o de desechos, o por el almacenamiento de sustancias tóxicas, corrosivas, inflamables o explosivas. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 14°: El Ministerio clasificará a las industrias, de acuerdo con las características de sus faenas y productos, con arreglo a los criterios establecidos con anterioridad. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 15°: Los establecimientos incómodos por vapores deberán emplear procedimientos conducentes a condensarlos o mitigarlos. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 16°: Para evitar los olores, se mantendrá una escrupulosa limpieza; se usarán procedimientos que impidan las fermentaciones pútreas y, cuando sea necesario, se usarán desodorantes, campanas o chimeneas. Los materiales mal olientes se guardarán en recintos herméticamente cerrados. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 17°: En los trabajos de soldadura ocasionales, que necesariamente deban efectuarse en la vía pública, se instalarán elementos protectores para evitar deslumbramientos. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 18°: La localización de los establecimientos industriales deberá ajustarse a lo establecido en los planos reguladores o planos de zonificación. En ausencia de un régimen de zonificación vigente, corresponderá al Ministerio resolver sobre el sitio en que puedan instalarse. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 19°: Las industrias inofensivas podrán situarse en zonas que no revistan el carácter de industriales, pero que reúnan adecuadas condiciones, a juicio del Ministerio.<br>  <br>  ARTICULO 20°: Las industrias insalubres y peligrosas sólo podrán establecerse en zonas o parques industriales, en los que se hayan previsto sitios especiales para éstas, que contemplen el aislamiento necesario y todos los demás factores pertinentes entre ellos el sentido de los vientos y de las aguas, para que los riesgos que generen queden debidamente confinados dentro de los límites del lote correspondiente al establecimiento. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 21°: Si las zonas o parques industriales no han previsto áreas especiales para las industrias insalubres y peligrosas, el Ministerio resolverá la localización sobre la base de que queden debidamente aisladas, en propiedades que tengan la superficie necesaria para evitar que los factores de riesgo trasciendan al respectivo inmueble. Las eventuales ampliaciones del establecimiento quedarán sujetas a las mismas restricciones. <br>  La disminución del área del terreno exigida a una industria, como requisito para su localización, sin permiso del Ministerio, podrá dar lugar a la clausura del establecimiento. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 22°: Ningún establecimiento podrá funcionar si constituye un elemento de peligro, insalubridad o incomodidad para la vecindad, ya sea por las condiciones de mantención de su local, por la forma o sistemas que emplea en la realización de sus operaciones, para la forma en que emplea para eliminar los desechos, residuos o emanaciones resultantes de sus faenas o por los ruidos que produce su operación. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 23°: Los establecimientos industriales que funcionen anti reglamentariamente o que constituyan peligro, incomodidad o insalubridad para su personal o la vecindad, podrán ser clausurados por la autoridad de salud y en todo caso, sus propietarios y administradores quedan obligados a cumplir las órdenes e instrucciones de la autoridad de salud conducente a poner fin o mitigar la insalubridad o molestia que producen. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 24°: Toda persona que desee establecer una industria, deberá tener la correspondiente autorización del Ministerio, tanto para su instalación como para su posterior funcionamiento, así como para modificar en cualquier forma la actividad original que le fue aprobada. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 25°: Ninguna autoridad podrá conceder patente, pernúsos o licencias para el funcionamiento de establecimientos industriales, sin que medie previa autorización del Ministerio. Los funcionarios que trasgredan esta disposición serán denunciados, a fin de que se les haga efectiva la responsabilidad prevista en el artículo 380 de la Ley General de Salud.<br>  <br>  ARTICULO 26°: Ninguna persona ni funcionario podrá dar inicio a los trámites de aprobación de planos, sin que el Ministerio se haya pronunciado previamente, en forma favorable, sobre la localización del uso industrial proyectado. Para obtener ese permiso de uso, el interesado deberá presentar: <br>  -   Copia del plano catastrado, con las referencias que determinen la localización exacta de la propiedad. <br>  -        Descripción del proceso industrial; <br>  -        Indicación de las materias primas que empleará; <br>  -    Mención de los residuos o desechos provenientes del proceso y los procedimientos de eliminación de éstos; y <br>  -    Indicación del número aproximado de trabajadores que servirán a la empresa. <br>  <br>  ARTICULO 27°: Una vez obtenida la aprobación prevista en el artículo anterior, el interesado podrá someter a la consideración del Ministerio los antecedentes necesarios para obtener el permiso de construcción. <br>  Para este fin, deberá acompa?ar: -   Plano catastrado del inmueble. <br>  <br>  -   Fórmula proporcionada por el Ministerio, denominada|`|weqRjszvaa	para mantener el orden <br>  <br>  cuidar la salud de los trabajadores <br>  <br>  y regular los mismos|`|yZaF0SURaa	que????

OUJdeuflaa	Hola:<br>  Creo que muchas veces nosotros mismo hacemos sentir que nuestra vida ya no tiene sentido porque no encontramos algo nuevo en ella, pero lo cierto es que con un nuevo dia que vivas ese es el instan mágico para decir yo puedo seguir adelante, puedo superarme y demostrarme a misma lo capaz que soy de realizar lo que se me ponga enfrente.<br>  Luego respecto a tu relación, creo que te estás obsesionando un poco con esta persona, no trates de hacer que el se aburra buscandolo todos los dias, yo se que es difícil, pero tambien ten en cuenta que el tiene sus compromisos, que tiene vida propia y no sabes relamente que es lo que pasa por sumente.<br>  Trata de llevarte un poco tranquilas las cosas, buscalo y llamale pero tambien deja que el lo haga, es bueno sentirte apreciado y querido por alguien, pero sobre todo ten en cuenta que todo lo que tu decidas y hagas en esta vida, trae consecuencias y da?os que aveces son imposibles de reparar, piensa en realidad que es lo que quieres y esperas de la vida, porque de tus decisiones depende tu futuro.|`|6ef03aca8af107ac3d6e880c2eb55e71aa	Te entiendo... Pues mira, los estadounidenses en esencia no son como los latinos, eso dicen... Porque no le pones el ejemplo de una "amiga" (imaginaria) que se fue a estados unidos y que vive con un americano y que se llevan bien o que se yo que mas le cuentes. A la mejor no se atreve a decirte nada más porque le da miedo que ya no lo tomes en serio, quien sabe que sienta de las latinas, que le han contado... O entre broma y broma, dile que es tan lindo que un día de estos te lo raptas ( a ver que dice) y lo escondes debajo de tu cama. Si cambia de tema pues mas claro que el agua, no. Que tal si te dice que si y así le sigues haciendo "bromas" mas y mas directas... A ver que dice, tu anota... Si no ves futuro te vas cortando y ya. Deja que el vaya a verte, a la mejor quiere ver como vives y por eso no se ha decidido, hasta ver que onda, que haces, como vives en tu país. Ojo y lee entre lineas, aprovechando cualquier tema.|`|Os7uF5hRaa	Mujer...mujer....Yo no soy nadie para darte un consejo pero tu caso suena como una mujer necesitada de cari?o y afecto, el cual estás buscando en este caso por internet.<br>  <br>  En lo personal me parece difícil que una relación por este medio sea satisfactoria. Todas son buenas al principio pero se requiere algo más que meses de amistad para entablar una relación seria. Claro que hay excepciones, pero en ti, veo un poco de desesperación.<br>  <br>  No lo digo por críticar, al contrario. Ten cuidado en meterte con personas practicamente desconocidas. No es lo mismo escribir diario y cuatro días de vacaciones que una vida al lado de un desconocido.<br>  <br>  Ten más paciencia. Si quieres, cuando estés desempleada busca un trabajo en alemania. No sé si sea difícil pero es posible. De esta forma puedes tratar más de cerca a este hombre y saber si es tu media naranja.<br>  <br>  Yo estoy padeciendo una indifelidad por parte de mi esposa. Dejamos que la relación se enfriara y ellá decidió enamorarse de alguien más. Sigue conmigo porque la descubrí y me pidió perdón, pero, en el fondo, siento que algo se rompió. Faltó a mi confianza y eso no se cura como la gripa. se requieren a?os para recuperarla.<br>  <br>  Estamos en terapia y ha salido a relucir que ambos tenemos conflictos emocionales de la infancia que no nos dejan ver nuestros errores. Aquí es donde quería llegar. Ve a un terapeuta. Hay algunos que atienden de forma gratuita por parte del gobierno. Allí descubrirás quien eres en realidad. Es posible que al darte cuenta descubras que no necesitas de una pareja para ser feliz, y ni siquiera viajar a Alemania. A lo mejor tu media naranja está a la vuelta de la esquina solo que no te has fijado en él.<br>  <br>  Piensa dos veces por favor.

I have no idea what to say. I think she likes you though. Go and ask her out, I'm pretty sure you can do it.|`|MJb0AZCPaa	To be honest, you probably freaked her out a little.  Usually when girls get the vibe that a guy likes them (and they don't feel the same way about the guy) they try and ignore them a little to give off an obvious hint.  However, this girl seems a little confusing if she's somewhat flirting with you after you stopped talking.  Here's my opinion:  The majority of girls LOVE attention.  If a girl knows a guy likes her, she might flirt with him just for the hell of it.  Just for a little bit of a thrill, a chase if you wish to call it.  I know it's mean, but it makes girls feel that they are appreciated and will continue to do it until there is someone new to move on to.  My advice to you?  Ignore her.  Don't be rude about it, but simply stop talking to her.  Let this girl initiate everything, and when she does, don't go into extensive detail.  Make her work to find out what she wants to know.  Girls hate that.  Once you've let her initiate things a few times then you can go back to normal, but don't make yourself seem available unless she's genuinely interested.  Good luck!|`|BF2TNGogaa	there's no problem. she acts wierd around you because she can't find something to say. she wants to talk but can't find the words. so she makes immitations hoping you'll get the message that she wants to talk to you. don't make assumptions on race. even though there's a few asian girls that are wierd doesn't mean they all are. sorry i have a problem with disctrimination like that sorry! yeah she likes you its totally obvious!|`|Oh8XNMUFaa	I think she likes you but she's embarrassed. Just give her time like you probably have been doing and she'll warm up a little bit each day. That "boo" and poke in the ribs was a very good sign. It's a cute un-awkward flirty way for a girl to say hey and get your attention. When I'm told that I'm liked, it's very very hard for me to talk to him afterwards because I'm just embarrassed, but I soon warm up. It doesn't mean that I don't like him back...some girls just handle these situations diferently.|`|tjAp8rWGaa	well it sounds like she likes you..so it doesnt hurt to try and the way she acts kinda tgives it away that she likes you but doesnt want to make it too obvious...so ask her and maybe she really does....|`|bTysBaIZaa	she likes you<br>  <br>  Experts on human mating state that women may display the following signals when they are interested in you:<br>  <br>  1.

QEidnoQDaa	Normally if this is becoming a problem , the judge would either have you all set up a time when he can call and talk.. the next option is for him to purchase a cell phone for them to use.. that way he can call them and vice versa and you don't have to deal with him.<br>  My ex is currently getting my 6 year old a cell phone.. It will be given to him when he comes home from school each day if he wants to carry it.. and when he wants to phone his dad , he can at any time.. I too can calll my son when he is with Daddy.. My ex is a control freak and uses my home and cell phones as his excuse to call his son, but he never calls when the son is home.. usually calls 5 to 15 times a day when he knows they are in school..<br>  But no to answer your initial question.. there is no legal limit unless you are being harassed.|`|m81dfyOYaa	If I didn't have custody of my kids I'd want talk to them everyday.|`|q4I46wyGaa	Technical terms are "telephone priveledges at reasonable times and places as agreed upon by both parties"  at least in my state anyhow.|`|7OYP2uSDaa	it really depends on the age of the kids, if they are old enough to have a cell phone, then your ex can just call them directly, that shouldn't present a problem, but if they are young and he has to call you first to put them on the phone, then no, I wouldn't do that everyday, because he is gonna end up always being in your personal business...|`|Eydwy9uXaa	you have divorced your husband. the children did not divorce their dad ,if there was no legal reason for your ex not to see the children, then let them decide , it's not a good idea to set rules here, but keep it on a stable footing , otherwise he may say that it was all your fault etc, if the children do not wish to see him be with them as the support,children are easily intimidated

If you are only "#3" and he realizes you will make out with him, etc. and he doesn't have to commit, why would he change?  Now, if you were distant and just acted like friends that would be more appropriate.  He already cheated on her with you, so he would do the same to you...I wouldn't try and be with him, no matter how much you like him.|`|NneY3kQXaa	I think he knows you like him and is just using you as a call girl.  He gets it from his girlfriend and from you(sounds like one lucky guy)  don't give him anything else.  I had the same thing with this guy Chris, when I was young and stupid, I was his back up girl.  If he was interested in a relationship with you he would be with you.  Don't be easy and hold out for more because you are worth so much more.|`|aufHfyu2aa	Wow, you are a real work of art.  People like you disgust me, dumbass.|`|wV19G0CLaa	i think he's just using you.. he already has a gf.. maybe he just needs some physical action! and he's using you, knowing that you really like him, so you would do anything for him probably, and he wants to be with someone.. his gf is NOT there.. so he has the perfect opportunity to have anything he desires.. and he can have you both at the moment so why not?! (that's how he must be thinking!)<br>  <br>  don't let him use you any longer.. for one he has a gf! so back off! if he's willing to leave her and be with you in a relationship then maybe it's another story.. otherwise don't hang on to him.. you deserve someone who cares about you and loves you and would ONLY EXCLUSIVELY be with you.!|`|yBcFqwn9aa	He may like you, but I hope you like yourself enough not to deal with this situation for long.

If you aren't careful, chances could be, you will wind up like the last one... cheated on. And why would you look at yourself as a number on a guys list anyway? I find that to be degrading and I'm sure you are a precious young lady and should be treated as such. My opinion, I'd ditch him.|`|vww8suj8aa	Tell him that you want to have sex with him.

odONDV9laa	I am sooo sorry for what happened to you!<br>  <br>  Please do not hurt yourself .... and please do not feel that you are not good enough. You are, I KNOW you are.<br>  <br>  We all have these insecurities, we all think that there are people who are better than us. But this is not true.  <br>  They are different than us but not better, because we all have qualities and we all have flaws that makes us ...well ...just human.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel...I've been through a similar situation and the only thing that stopped me feeling like wanting to kill myself was the day I decided that he must "die" out of my life not me. <br>  So I started to pretend that he does not exist anymore...and trust me it was hard as I had to see him everyday at work.<br>  But things got better everyday. <br>  And start doing things to keep you busy....(I know you do not feel like it) but do it anyway. Anything that will help you not to think about her or what she did.<br>  <br>  Trust me ...the more you think about something bad that happen to you ....the worst it gets. <br>  <br>  I really do not think you can be together anymore, no matter what she will say. You will never trust her again. And you are right not to.<br>  <br>  Also, you are young, very young as a matter of fact. You will someday love someone more than you love her. <br>  <br>  Trust me, every time you will fall in love you will believe that this is the love of your life and that you have never loved the same way before. <br>  It is only natural to feel a present situation with more intensity than any other past experience. Because it is happening NOW and you feel it NOW!|`|rzgWnFHKaa	If she has been texting you, she probably does miss you. Maybe she has found that the "Grass isn't always Greener on the Other side". Was this guy out of town that she went to meet?. She just may want her cake and eat it too. You don't mention how old you are, maybe she needs to see what she thinks she is missing. I don't know though, if she is going to get up and go and meet someone else that easily, what is she going to do next time?. I would be very careful if I were you. Sit down and ask her what is going on. You guys need to talk about your expectations of each other and the future of the relationship. All I can say is good luck and I hope it works out for you. Remember though that not one person in this world is worth killing yourself over. If this doesn't work out, then it wasn't meant to be. But there will be somebody out there for you. There are alot of fish in the sea. I know it feels absolutely terrible, but you will feel better in time. Trust me, I've been there. Take Care|`|wBiFYyxXaa	you need to confront her about it, ask her if her feelings for you is as strong as what you have for her. ask her if she wants to break up or if she has feelings for someone else. but honestly if she could do that to you after all youve guys have been through then is she reli the right girl for you... is she worth it, and will she just do it again, im sure your an amazing guy and if you two dont work out you'll find someone who cares and loves you deeply... so before killing yourself atleast think about the things you do have and how theres always someone else out there for you, even better you just havnt found her yet.<br>  good luck! wish you well!|`|887362377ddb5359c6d05d5d3e830b4caa	Buck up now.

GiPIBtQ8aa	Try daring him to say something like..say I Love You in a way that does not include the words I Love You.
ZaAFQIilaa	wow we are in the same boat i have the same prob. if u figure that answer will u send it to me. i have no idea what to do either.
slHUNl58aa	You can't make her forgive you. If your very lucky she might, but since she knows you played her that is a long shot. <br>  If knowing her changed you for the better keep the lesson even if you don't get to keep the girl. Hopefully it will make you think twice before you play with anyones life or emotions for selfish reasons.|`|QYukf2Xbaa	Time may work. Lots of time. Her trust must be shattered, but probably not in disrepair.|`|rIc3pA8yaa	ask her forgiveness and tell her you love her but you thought she was going over board at some times but don't say it like a jerk
nErAWfHxaa	Try to introduce him to others in your apartment building and workplace, invite him to sit with a group of you as you eat lunch, that sort of thing. The more people he knows, the more people he can hang around.
qPDf7yPFaa	Almost everyone is very messy at times, especially if there is little time to tidy up because of a very busy schedule.<br>  <br>  Unless you're talking about a different kind of "messy"... If that's what you're talking about, then it's just how it is... there is nothing you can do about that.

Lawc7qiwaa	To me it sounds as though she already likes you, but the only way you can be sure is to spend more time with her. Get to know her better, joke around, have fun. Maybe you can meet up on the weekend (not a date or anything, just as friends). <br>  <br>  She is showing a lot of symptoms of a girl liking a guy, the waving, staring, using your name, and compliments are ways that girls show guys that they like them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|3862869d2277892d5cee0d11ed5f2caaaa	Try talking to her more|`|6f0dfee0b91641e62c25c07f9102c613aa	she likes you and you should ask her out somewere just to hang out and know each other and also ask for her number|`|BjIUkJbHaa	well.... <br>  <br>  just hug her and maybe kiss her and see what happens|`|QfA7G1C4aa	You should try to talking with her to see what kind of person she is as you never know u might develop feels for this girl|`|yvTvDWm5aa	Aha, hunny, as a girl, I say forget about her. She doesn't sound worth it at all. You shouldn't come on this website for dating advice either... because half of these people have nooo idea what they're saying [like me, lol] So try and find a new girl who reallyyyyyyy likes you=)|`|b0VRWLC3aa	If she tells you that you are cute, how could she not like you? Haha, I know your just trying to make sure. She does. Talk to her, get into a conversation. Use a starter like "Do you have the time?" or something like that.

I like it|`|mMBPOjbFaa	either they have their red dot and because of hormones guys are emotional too they just dont show it the way girls do|`|5e6S1JqWaa	cause they have more feelings than boys do|`|7c364d66f9688d88ce8ebb20fae07315aa	That's just how we are someone has to add some substance to the relationship if girls weren't emotional we would be hopping from guy to guy just like guys hop from girl to girl.It's just our nature.|`|8fc631e41ad2374db0b841af558ea19faa	just how they are wired|`|BFMGCnyjaa	I think it just has to do with the type and amount of hormones. That is why some girls are more emotional than others.|`|jPoQm3C1aa	Hormones.  the Estrogen we got makes us want to cry... luckily i'm not like alot of other girls... i hate crying over spilt milk, it makes me feel like an airhead.|`|4DP3RYwnaa	aye mayne.<br>  not all girls are emotional.<br>  im a girl and im not emotional at all.|`|AA11196103	just the way they are|`|H6fHcXN8aa	Because there are idiotic men in this world and we can't stand them!|`|KnBrgBe5aa	Hormones, innate stupidity.|`|b3Szziy2aa	MOST GIRLS ARE EMOTIONAL, BUT NOT ME!!!!!!<br>  I really don't care about anything, even if I'm called fat or ugly. It's a waste of time to act all whiney when insulted.<br>  I'm like "WTF IS WRONG WITH THEM?" everytime I see another girl crying about something stupid. I really don't get it much either.|`|hpsj8a8Gaa	That's just how they are. Men tend to be more logical (please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you are stupid, girls) for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  You're asking why girls are so emotional. Well I can bet girls ask why boys have to be so logical. The answer is that boys think a bit too much sometimes and that's not good. It's better not to analyse everything around you sometimes.<br>  <br>  Just try to understand how they feel.|`|nIJGEEyZaa	just because... we are girls!|`|nxXBA4IAaa	why do men have two heads but can only think with one ( not the one on your shouldders)|`|JX5SmP63aa	not all girls so just because you see one crying or something that dont mean all the girls okay? :]
6Rkk2biJaa	No my dear it is called control , but later on hopefully :))|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	No, she has to turn me on|`|jZsHAaKiaa	Aroused, yes - if we're physically attracted to them.  If we only like them in an intellectual way, then possibly not - although that can still be quite a turn-on as well.  Always remember that arousal is half physical and half mental.  Either way, we simply don't maintain an erection for the entire date, but it's always on the ready - just in case.  Men are like that, especially young men - they're not yet used to the excess hormones sloshing through their bloodstreams.|`|2Uooy10uaa	no.|`|XozfdObQaa	Most guys wouldn't be aroused the ENTIRE time, perhaps just when the woman says/does something that turns him on...ex. rubbing her foot against his leg, talking about "plans" for later that night.|`|tx5crjykaa	no because the interest levels affect the as you said" warmthin your groin area".|`|vFLHA3aYaa	sounds like an infatatuation....which is a chemical made in a different part of the brain then love. and usually does not lead to long term..sorry

92rdbIamaa	The age of your girlfriend should tell you something, she is very young and in mature... She has never had children and so she cannot relate to what a parent feels.<br>  <br>  She also does not understand even though you have moved on with your life with her that you and your ex are forever bonded because of the children. <br>  So she either needs to grow up and accept this or else you need to kick her to the curb and find someone more reasonable..<br>  She also must understand that you are a dad first and foremost even though the children do not live with you, your children always will come first above anything or anyone.. So if this young kid you are with cannot accept this than you need to move on without her..<br>  Sometimes the good sex with a 20 year old is not all that a mature man needs..... <br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|AA11534512	Play with someone your own age with perhaps a small bit of maturity.|`|iJHDs8reaa	You should move in with the 20 year old. keep a boundary, You just got divorce and moved in with someone else.  DUMB!!!  Keep a distance and bag her and then take her home....Wathc out for a pregnancy|`|pWrTcGN4aa	I think the girlfriend is going to cause you trouble in your life.  Don't let her come between you and your children.  They need to come first.  If she can't get a grip on this she needs to move on.  And good for you for being civil to you children's mom.  I think that is great and it's too bad more dads couldn't be more like that.|`|zvEAOvd1aa	explain to her that there has to be some kind of communication between you and your ex wife for the kids sake. and that there will always be a little something there because of the fact that you guys were once married and have three children. shell have to understand otherwise its very inmature and selfish of her.

VJRf1m0naa	Whatever happens, happens. For first kisses, usually no tongue, but it depends on the couple.|`|UOLIbZ0Waa	it doesnt have to have anything. start of with lips and if u feel comfortable, then use a little tongue. or if they use tongue first, then again if you are comfortable then do it back to them, if not either keep going or stop|`|Dn0xXyqGaa	What ever you and the person your kissing is comfortable with.. if you are nerveous maybe get them to make that first move. other than that french kissing is very pleasurable/passionate for the both of you have fun now ;)|`|Io822Pqyaa	it doent need tongue<br>  it can be a simple as a quick peck|`|NzRiWOYjaa	One its up to u.

RN8LdbbBaa	I have no idea how old you are, but if he works that could explain the time inbetween calls and visits.  Maybe he does like you but does not want to come on too strong.  Either way, make it a point to be busy, no matter how much you want to see him, next time he calls.  This will show him that you are not simply waiting for him to call.  If he thinks you are busy maybe next time he won't wait so long inbetween dates to make plans for the next one.|`|P2fK09CHaa	If he really liked you then he would be calling you and seeing how you're doing. But by the looks of it, he doesn't really seem like he wants to be in this relationship. hate to break it to you but it looks like you're gonna have to dump him and move on with your life.|`|EMiiwoT1aa	If he doesn't have responsibilities like work, school etc. And you live close and its possible for you to see eachother more then yeah he should want to see you and most defiantly want to speak to you more. I think you know your own answer, move on and find somebody that is worth your troubles :) x|`|xXuA72yyaa	maybe he just wanted closure. and if you really liked him, you would have been happy with seeing hin once a week. things happen and schedules get messed up.|`|C6QyEtWvaa	he probably just wanted to get with u|`|635890b7eaf69137233c1c37ceeecf6caa	Affirmative.

It's a little irrational for her to just blow you off for it; if my boyfriend asked me, sure, I'd be pretty upset, but I would explain to him first. Try to get her to talk it out with you, she should come around.|`|69TAX6SVaa	you did nothing wrong, you asked a question, and if your gf was not using you, i think she would have answerd the question, but she didnt, and if she is sooo willing to let you go just because of that, then she is not worth it, do not let one girl walk on your heart.|`|CkBGJsB8aa	well what helps is you should talk and apologize to her and tell her that you really like her and that you are really sorry.

fWFtotuuaa	you should be afraid.  he is stalking you.  sounds like most of this is happening at school, so please contact your counselor, vice-principal, or even your campus security.  if he shows up at your home again, before you hide, call 911.  this is on the edge of becomming a dangerous situation for you.  protect yourself, let others know, and don't be intimidated into not saying anything because you may be afraid of retribution.  you have to protect YOU.|`|C6QyEtWvaa	file a police report|`|NIuZWoGmaa	Sounds like a stalker. Call the police on him. He has no right to be doing this. He needs to leave you alone. He shouldn't know your passwords, your locker combo or anything else. He also shouldn't be screaming outside your bedroom window at you. You need to call the police and get a restraining order on him, or this might get worse. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|apyQSMzUaa	This is what you call stalking!! This is really not good. you should talk to either your parents and tell them what's going on or you should call the cops i suggest that you do bath but you need to do what's better fo you.

REPORT HIM TO THE POLICE NOW!!!|`|L7ENvrisaa	runnnnnnnnnnn before he kills you<br>  <br>  good luck|`|nRJPJDaKaa	Ok, well don't go anywhere alone, have a guy friend walk you places and change all your passwords, get a new lock for your locker. And alert a counciler that he is stalking you and that you are scared. Say you don't want a mediation or anything, just to tell her so you can take preventative measures. Tell your parents he is kind of freaking you out and don't stay at home alone, go over to a friends house after school or to the library. If he shows up at your house like that again, call the police, because that is trespassing and he needs to know he is doing something wrong. I would strongly recommend telling your dad that this guy is freaking you out and ask about getting a restraining order.
9TsRi3dlaa	sounds like it to me! do you like him? if so, tell his friends to ask him if he likes you in private. if he says yes, then have his friends tell him you like him back. and BAM you have a date!!|`|8ZJEYApxaa	he may.  he may also just like your company.  if he really likes spending time with you, like going out of his way to talk to you, then he might.  there's only one way you'll know if he does.... ASK HIM!<br>  <br>  and don't have one of your friends ask him... that's not cool.|`|hiRwUEniaa	He is about to love you, but only on his inside, the guy is quite shy and don't know how to express his feeling, Now the question is.... do you like him??? IF YES THEN GO FOR IT!!!|`|Gw6QW69yaa	if u like him then like kinda flirt and see what he does|`|XHoFxEgbaa	I understand how you feel I was in that situation once too. I think it sounds like he likes you He may just be a player, but he may not be. What I say is go for it! Whats the worse that can happen!|`|4VLd85Z9aa	Yes he does but since he didn't say anything to your friends he could be shy so if you like him make a move on him.|`|9QY6kDsaaa	u sound really young lol if u still switch desks and stuff but hell yes he likes u and alot|`|N6tCv6nhaa	i think hes interested but not really comfortable. make smll talk with him and make joke nd stuff.|`|QJ902cRaaa	he likes u its obvious|`|zJbnZ3RRaa	well he does. hes on that phase he wants to KNOW you. so just let it go . the more closer he gets, soon you'll find out.|`|EpYJAJc7aa	haha yesss for sure<br>  <br>  :]|`|OwpPNYGxaa	yes|`|aLl0R6ffaa	heck ya|`|pa2PeQPVaa	hes got a crush on u|`|I8MUpN04aa	of course he like you, it was just embarrassing when your friends asked him about it-enjoy the fact that he sits beside you, and start talking to him-things will just work out on their own-enjoy the attention.|`|3vsnteRuaa	Of course he likes you think a little, just put it this way if one of your friends where in this situation you would say shut up you know he likes you dont deny it. So as a friend, i dont know you but, he likes you duh maybe start to flirt with him if you like him and he especially likes you if he wants to sit next to you and not his buddies
lEfl0inDaa	Unfortunately too many women and men don't realize that the grass is never greener on the other side.  We live in a disposable society where commitment means nothing more than "don't cheat" and if you get tired of something or someone, just toss it aside.  Many people do not realize that relationships take work from both people.  If everyone gave 100% percent of themselves to their partners rather than 50%, there would be a lot less dissatisfaction.   If they still leave, then just remember, it is better to find out now that it wasn't going to work then after marriage and children!|`|AA12236705	Yes some woman are like that but thats life...............|`|tDUEer8Baa	:(<br>  <br>  my first love left me and i wonder if he wants me back or not but he does sound jealous|`|75uASiDkaa	This applies to men who break up with women, also.<br>  <br>  The guy I'm dating right now dumped me four years ago, after we had been together for three years. Then two months ago we got back together again, and apparently during those 4 years we spent apart he still loved me. And I'm thinking, if that's true, then you wouldn't have resorted to dumping me! To which he says that he thinks it was best for us at the time cause we were in long distance and financial/transport issues and the fact we were only kids then put alot of strain on the relationship. I still worry that he may just leave me again for the same reasons, but I'm trying to put my trust in him. To be honest, things aren't going well with us because being with him again makes me feel so insecure. What if I'm just wasting my time only to have him leave me again? The thought terrifies me, and maybe I was a fool to give him another chance, but curiosity got the better of me, and the fact that I still had feelings for him. I know I couldn't just turn my back on it and regret not trying. But what if I regret this?<br>  <br>  Not only that, but guys I dated in the past (whether serious or casual relationships) always seem to come back into the picture at some point wanting you to sleep with them, but with no strings attached. I don't think this is so common when it comes to women who leave their men.|`|921a0451d462db3858aa244bfdf71a0baa	In my opinion, people are in no doubt, stupid. We all do stupid things and then we realize what we have done. In most cases its an immediate reaction and then after its done we realize what we've done and regret it. Women tend to do this alot because of outside influences. It could be the stupidest thing but at the time it seems like this huge deal. I dont blame you for being upset because it hurts, and make sure she knows how you feel, but dont be closed minded as well.<br>  <br>  Remember humans are imperfect and most of our lives are trial and error, sometimes more error then necessary but whatever.|`|rj0oG6n4aa	HMM..... well it could be that they're so cought up in the moment that they don't realize what a valuble person they've got with them..... i'm like that too :( but i know we have our reasons.... usually they're pretty lame... but it's totally up to you if you want this woman back in your life... i'd say maybe get to know her a little then see how things go........  if you think she's changed give it a shot ... BUT only if you'd like :) don't feel pressured to do anything you don't want to|`|9Nm05PWnaa	Women suck. Yes we do. The only thing you can hope for is a person that thinks like you do, like any of the people that just answered this question. But it's true, sometimes women don't understand what they do have because they have had nothing else to compare it to.|`|cl9p41Flaa	Yes its true.Some people won't realize how great their significant other are until they are gone.They begin to miss them.The grass isn't always greener on the other side.
lmcDwKqhaa	Yeah go on give him a little something it wont hurt and i bet he will like it i know i would.<br>  gazz|`|9Xkbfnfcaa	Forget presents. Just plan a nice relaxing and sexy evening with him. Maybe leave notes for mhim to follow or do somethijng special for eachother. Massage, candles, dinner all make for a great romantic evening. Have fun.|`|7pqSoHVdaa	If he's not the type who gets excited over anniversary and presents, don't give him any.  However, you can do a nice dinner, maybe even cook it :)<br>  Maybe something special in the bedroom.<br>  This way, you won't go over the top but still celebrate what's important to you.|`|fVhQt0MTaa	I think you should get him something for your 1 year anniversary for sure. Get him something small but meaningful, or you could get him sexy lingerie but obviously it is for you to wear! Roar.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and even though he may not get excited you are and he should know that about you!
PUvNq3SWaa	All that matters is if you are ready, no matter what he says.<br>  <br>  You can never be fully sure he's not lying and persuading, but one of the things you need in order to be ready is to trust someone completely. Clearly, you don't if you suspect he is just in it for the physical. <br>  <br>  Good luck, listen to your gut.|`|AmPkEeYyaa	Okay, naturally guys want sex.  But sex does NOT necessarily make a relationship last.  If he really wants to stay with you and all that, he'll wait for you to be ready.|`|OqnKkhKyaa	He's a guy. Of course he wants sex. When he gets it he's going to want a lot more. We all did, do and will. That's the nature of the beast. Best bet is to keep him thinking that when he gets back you might.|`|AA11458134	you're right not to believe him. he's just looking 4 enjoyment. don't give in, especially if deep within u, u're not ready|`|Molu004zaa	There's no way of telling for sure, but I smell some serious BS. I think you should stick with your instincts and don't give in to him. Also, you might want to re-evaluate your relationship completely; do you really want to be with a guy who pressures you for sex?|`|hPHznDwpaa	hes making it up<br>  if your not ready he should wait for you<br>  and that will either make or break your relationship, make it stronger or destroy it.<br>  <br>  if he loves you enough and respects you AND cares for you he should not pressure you
86Ai3lAKaa	I'm all about that butt.|`|ylI0GQyiaa	lol i would be in the percentage that hates their butt lol, i have know idea why men like them so much cause the only thing i like about my butt is that its comfy lol|`|0ZSIS0Okaa	Some women would prefer they were smaller cuz they think they're too big, but others (like me) would be happier if their butt was bigger. (to get the guys staring, cuz we know they like it!) haha! |`|BttalmMqaa	male+female=perfect combination<br>  positive +negative=0 what is it?|`|AA11481615	They look great in thongs lol|`|266ce72d1de1678467b731334682beeaaa	Guys love sexy ***..<br>  as simple as that...|`|ci6yOsvhaa	No..that's not a great idea.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Try these sites..they're free. <a href="http://www.MeJab.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.MeJab.com</a> - Vent Online, Battle Friends, Blog<br>

1qhrmZLWaa	You should move on, but not because of his behavior.  I never say good-bye either.  Some people just don't like it.  It's part of a person's make-up.  You should move on because no woman should sit at home waiting for a man, when there is plenty of life to be lived out there.  Let him do his thing, you do yours and if it's meant to be- have yourself a beautiful wedding (in the future).|`|Rf8g8LUhaa	If the only problem in your relationship is that he sometimes forgets to say goodbye before going away for training... it sounds like a pretty good relationship.

Does he have an issue with saying GOOD BYE, if and so that is the case then tell him to say something, not to leave you high and dry like that.

QQLN67uEaa	You keep on keeping on.  <br>  I know its hard, but literally everybody has times in their lives when they feel totally unwanted, out of place, and unloved.  This is normal, though it entirely sucks.  <br>  So, you persevere.  One thing that helps me is to remember what I have to offer.  The best thing I have to offer is my friendship to someone who needs it.  As lonely as we are, there are always other ppl who need a friend-- those ppl who are looked down upon, hard to relate to, kinda smell funny, etc.  Since we understand that being lonely sucks, we know its important to reach out to those ppl without friends.  <br>  <br>  Also, you have your time to offer. You have a more free schedule right now (since you're not spending as much time with friends) so you can volunteer.  This may mean volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, Big Brothers and Sisters, being a coach for a YMCA soccer team, helping a non-profit organization with IT support, etc.  If you don't know where to start, I'd email local non profit agencies (adoption agencies, Big Brothers and Sisters, Boys and Girls Club, ASPCA, etc.) and ask if they need any volunteers to volunteer at events, do admin. stuff, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you try to make the best of the time that you have here, you'll start to enjoy things more, and that'll naturally draw ppl to you.  <br>  I would look and see what you can learn from this time, as there's always something to be gained.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember, you're not alone.  We have all been in that entirely lonely spot, for much longer than we would like.|`|K6fasl6kaa	think of Jesus,  they hated him with out cause.|`|WOHha0sfaa	become a cynic like me... :(|`|jgjh7B22aa	well change your hole apperence and personallity and get new friends and just be different and then maybe they will like u!! :D<br>  <br>  worked for me!!! :)|`|mNYe7BNoaa	dont let it get to you... the real ones will be by your side|`|1sG72iFfaa	get a hooker|`|DHZkCTagaa	well watever you do.

sCECo8aZaa	Just call him up and be like you think he's a cool guy and all, but you wanna work things out with your ex. It's nothing personal, it's just that you didnt realize things would work out with your ex. Just remember 1 thing though, whatever the reasons you broke up with your ex were, there gonna be there when you get back. Sure for the first few weeks, or even month or so it'll seem like its all good and things are working out, but just make sure before leaving this new guy that the problems with your ex that you broke up over are something you are gonna be able to live with. Cause otherwise you'll for sure be breaking up with the ex again.|`|AA10814863	Dont do it over the phone, tht makes it seem like you dont care enough to do it in person.

How do you know that your ex is still interested? If he's talking to you when he knows you have a boyfriend that means he's willing to cheat on you, if he's wanting you to break up with this guy.. think about it.. <br>  No, don't do it over the phone. Do it in person.. Just tell him things aren't working out the way you thought they would and that you still have feelings for your ex.. If you still want to be friends with this guy, tell him! Tell him what he's been doing wrong if he asks.. Nothing's worse than not knowing. This worked with my ex. <br>  Good luck.|`|sM63WKjRaa	since the relationship is still new no real feelings should have developed yet technically your still in the getting to know each other phase. so i think you should be honest and explain the situation to him as nicely as possible. if he is a decent person he will understand and respect you for being honest with him and you two could possibly still be friends. it is not fair to him or you to be with him when you know that's not where your heart is because you can be with someone you see a future with and he can spend that time finding someone who truly wants to be with him. so be honest and it will all be ok|`|hnOnqhfkaa	"I realised that I still have feelings for my ex, and I can't forget him, I'm sorry you had to go through this. If i be with you, I might hurt you even more cuz I still have feelings for him."<br>  <br>  or just say "I just feel like we don't have the connection.."<br>  <br>  p.s Although I seem to see people breaking up using txt mssges lately (my sis included), i don't hink it is the right thing. Meet him for a final date and work this out.|`|5lpVfEWNaa	You should tell him the truth it is better than lying with something like this but don't do it over the phone.|`|99tS4Cqtaa	over the phone wouldnt be that bad just NOT over texting or computer....<br>  <br>  it sux<br>  trust me. lol <br>  <br>  yea just tell it to him straight. <br>  that u rather just stay friends and make it short and sweet.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Just tell him that its not working out and you don't want to continue the relationship anymore.<br>  <br>  It's better than stringing him along.|`|v5CVNzPVaa	Be honest and do it however you feel comfortable.
apNociVTaa	Hmm, tough choice, there are good arguments for dumping him and taking him back. He seems like he's really committed though, so I say take him back, from a guy's POV I think he's sorry, but if it ever happens again dumb his ***.|`|zn1I994Eaa	Any guy that actually throws rocks at your window sounds like a keeper to me.<br>  If you talk to him, first make him feel a little guilty by talking to him.<br>  then punch that ***** in the face.|`|cZysB8O7aa	So this girl went after you bf and ex bf?

He just might be telling the truth.

As soon as you are ready to get into another relationship, you are over him.

E6x6fYn5aa	I know lots of adults who are really into video - games.  It's a hobby, some people, watch sports, others read newspapers, others play video games.  Believe me there are many worse things that he could be doing with his time.  He appearantly has the self control to get himself through college, so I assume he is not a total junkie.<br>  <br>   I may be way off here, but it sounds like he still enjoys your company, and hasn't found anyone else yet, so in a sense the door is still open if you want to go in.  <br>  <br>  I would try to figure out what was really the cause of the original break up.  If it was really about him not having enough time for his personal interests, well thats easy to fix if you are ok with it.<br>  <br>  It may be that there was some other reason that he broke up (I suspect breaking up over video game time is not very common in post-college life.).  It is likely some need of his that wasn't being met. Talk to him, maybe you will find out what he wants.  If it is something that is ok with you, great.  If not move on.|`|AA12261142	he wants his cake and be able too eat it too ie he wants too date u and others|`|aDL7xmt6aa	You're both children, grow up.|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	He still thinks about you every day, and talks to you when he sees you online.  He probably (guessing from my own past experience) wants you back. <br>  <br>  What he is not sure he's ready for is the friends part.  You need to decide if you think you have made a mistake and want him back as well, or you need to back off and give him time to heal.  From your description it sounds like he's got it bad for you. |`|wpVSkvjkaa	"My ex boyfriend and I split because he wasn't getting enough free time (time to play video games)"<br>  <br>  I don't know if I should shake my head in disbelief, or laugh my azz off....."time to play video games".....you gotta be kidding me....<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd answer this question at greater length, but it time to get back to "The Legend of Zelda".......|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	You answered your own question.  You've acknowledged why you split, so don't nag and learn how to love his interest too, that weay your spending time together and he'll be more open to your interest.  Time helps, so maybe try to get back together, it will probably work this time.|`|6NNQZnsoaa	Marta....Marta....Marta.....You sound hurt, and you miss him as well....But you have no idea how freakin ignorant this "boy" sounds. Do you think for one second if there was a warm passionate women in the house that I or any other "man" would give a @#$% about the mario brothers playing in the ps3. Think about this and give yourself more credit. This guy is upset because he needs more time for video games......just shoot me please! Real life is passing you by....and already has passed him. While he is trying to get to the next level on the game......You should be drinking wine naked by the fire with a glazed look on your face from being with a warm man that "wants" to spend time with you.....Sorry.....that's just me.|`|vIM1GvS2aa	First of all, men are not as complicated as you seem to think. Us women over think everything. He is probably unsure of what you want and therefore reluctant to say what he wants. You should tell him exactly what you want and then you might get the answer you are looking for from him|`|xONTmijHaa	He wants you to beg to him and I suggest you don't.|`|7HGmoleHaa	Do I have to be a man to answer this? I'm a counselor and deal with these types of problems daily.A lot of couples have problems when someone has a video game addiction because the other feels neglected. It depends on how much time they spend playing them that causes problems, the key thing is to come to some kind of agreement and compromise, for example, if you ask him how much time does he need to be alone to play his games, then he needs to adhere to it and spend time with you.Maybe he just needs some time to sort through his feelings and the break up now and is unsure about things. I would give him some space and let him initiate asking to take you out.|`|AA10473705	Sorry I am not a dude, but I have been here before. It is likely he isn't grown up enough to know what to he really wants. Why video games? Is he 16 years old? If he is indeed the more mature type then video games might be a necessary way to de-stress. What kind of job does he have- does he have a lot of bad days?<br>  <br>  Don't remember where I heard this but guys come home and need to say hello to the dog, take off his shoes, grab the paper and go straight to the video games, bathroom, office, or couch. Their "Cave".  They do need alone time, and you need to be patient. Give him at least 15 minutes before you start in on asking him how was his day, or telling him what you want to do.  <br>  <br>  At some point he gets into his games and likely doesn't like to be interrupted. So tell him in advance you want to go on a walk or leave the house for anything else in 30 minutes. Or- you could try playing the games yourself. This was hard for me- it just looked soooo booring! But there is a risk you could start liking them too- and too much!<br>  <br>  He says he's not sure if he is ready. Well, be straight up and ask him. Does he think you were starting to get too naggy or too serious? Does he even want anything more than a friend "with benefits" but nothing else? I'm sure you forgot to go to the "Read your boyfriends mind" workshop... so ask, don't go crazy, and get it out of him.
A91e6T71aa	I am a STRONG believer in signs, and if you looked for her, didnt find her, and then all of a sudden you have an add request from her and she just made it, you guys were definitely meant to get back in contact. <br>  <br>  You definitely need to not look into it so much as a love possibility, because thats when things get complicated, but maybe you were meant to be there for her durign this difficult time for her.  Be a friend to her and if things progress, good for you guys,just dont force it.<br>  <br>  I had a similar situation, where my boyfriend and I stopped seeing each other, and then I found a business card to his company randomly at my new desk, and as much as I would try to forget him things would always happen to make us cross paths... there's no such thing as a coincidence... things happen because they are meant to. Oh yeah.. end of my story.. so far we have been living happily ever after with a newborn daughter, once we stopped making up excuses between us :-)|`|L9Iwuhp4aa	I don't know if i believe in fate, but I think that your paths were supposed  to cross again. |`|nX2InAHVaa	Dear Rice,<br>  <br>  Hello! Fred Borman here!<br>  <br>  My oh my, what a situation we have on our hands here! The love of your love has come crawling back into your life, but this time with some baggage! Back when I was in school these were the sorts of cases I dreamed of counseling!<br>  <br>  Let's get to it though. You clearly haven't thought this through. This isn't the same cute, perky little petite girl whom you were fornicating with back in high school. Oh no, not by a long shot. She has been through the process of CHILD BIRTH! Remember that tight vagina that used to do wonders for you? GONE! NO MORE! By even the most conservative estimates that thing has tripled in circumference after 10 years of undoubtedly being used and abused by any man so kind enough to buy her a shot of tequila and the added strain of childbirth on top of that? Forget about it!<br>  <br>  Are you prepared for the responsibilities of being a step father? Before you answer, remember that a step father is NOT a real father. Being a step father is more like being a creepy uncle that no one in the family likes. No matter how great of a step father you are (or more realistically you THINK you are) the kid will hate you, her family will hate you and eventually she will hate you. Forget about it!<br>  <br>  Hopefully that has changed your outlook on this predicament. My advice would be to stay as far away from this situation as possible. However since you are already so adept at using MySpace to stalk women, why not try getting to know a few nice young high school seniors? That ought to put you back on the right track.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  <br>  Fred Borman, Family Counselor|`|Riekcjmfaa	tl;dr|`|aHyxVd6oaa	How bout your making a really big deal out of a little thing.

The guy mite have some people out there. Dont wanna see you die cause of my advice. hah jk dude but make sure things are done with the guy and ahve a few dates and see what happends. You got nothing to lose.<br>  Your Boy,<br>  Dont give my name on Yahoo.|`|rJb3ERXeaa	I personally don't believe in fate, but coincidence it shall be. <br>  <br>  It's cute to read a story like this and well, myspace I guess does do wonders sometimes. I was thinking of closing my account earlier because I have no use for it. Or at least tell it not to send me anymore notification so I don't be able to see it again and be reminded of it. <br>  <br>  What I think you should be thinking if that are you goign to wait it out and see if the marriage lasts and ready to go into a relationship with a woman and her son? <br>  <br>  I hope you two have sparks and fireworks when you see each other. Sounds likes long lost love. (;|`|m8JdxlwCaa	Congratulations Rice! <br>  <br>  It seems like love has fallen into your lap, yet like my esteemed friend and savior of my marriage to my loving husband, she does have a little baggage following her.  Alas do not let this opportunity pass you bye, don't let that dead beat of a husband of hers get in the way of your love, yet another bag to add, a ex husband and a messy divorce. but i can see you are a strong man unlike myself which swore off women not because i am not attracted but the baggage that they bring. (Only thing a man brings with him is a ex and you know what they say it never hurts to wield 2 swords.)  Sorry, enough about me i say you meet with each other, stop beating around the bush and just penetrate right in there.  She has given you the sign just throw a little persuasion in there and speed things up time waits for no man.  God im starting to cry love is such a beautiful thing and what you have is so much and what a love story if i have ever heard one.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question you are not looking to far into things, you are not looking hard enough now grasp that taco of love and let the meat of your being be wrapped in the warmth of love.<br>  <br>  Hope i have helped. Your friend,<br>  <br>  James Lichtenstien|`|wIyq2IK7aa	I can tell you from experience, this is dangerous territory, beware.  First of all, this woman is a mess if she's running to you already, let her get her head on straight and be completely divorced before you do anything.  I'd say start with friendship, but believe me, if you've both been holding a torch this long, that won't happen.  You're headed for a crash and burn tale.

They have to respectful of their girl's feelings and her parents. They have to know how to treat them when something bad happens to them or their family. They need to know the word no. They need to talk to their girl like a human being. They need to have trust in their relationship. They need to wait to have sex. And they have to fight for their girl if another guy is harming them. Dad included if he is abuseing her. Talk to her when she is upset. Bring her flowers b4 you go on a date. Hold the door open for her when you leave or enter a buliding.|`|VSIwtpc3aa	This is the easiest question. First he don't want you just for sex. Second he calls you even just to say hello.

I promise they will love you back.|`|psyxx4ynaa	Do little things, like open the door for her. Pay for her movie ticket. Tell her she looks pretty, and really compliment her. Don't be afraid to hold her hand in public- girls love that sort of stuff. Put your arm around her. Give her your hoodie when she's cold. Send her good morning texts. Leave her funny voicemails. Watch her favorite tv show with her- even if you hate it. Be nice to her friends. Surprise her with her favorite candy. Just make sure you give her her space, and don't suffocate her. Try to understand what she's telling you. <br>  <br>  For your second question-<br>  First- girls are different from your guy friends. Don't talk about burping or whatever it is you guys talk about when you're together. Make sure you smell nice when you talk to girls. Also, compliment them. Make them feel good about themselves.

She should be the one getting in trouble for all these things. It really isn't your fault on any of these things and I think that they are just getting you in trouble because they don't want to get their little angel in trouble. Don't tell them in those exact words but along those lines. If I were you I would blow up at them but not a yelling blow up, a crying blow up. It works and gets you way farther then yelling at them. They end up yelling back and then most likely you would get in trouble.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	don't tell them anything. wait till your sister goes to sleep and pour a little bit of warm water in the palm of her hand. it will make her pee the bed. then go tell all of her friends and boyfriends that she pees the bed. that'll teach her not to mess with you.|`|438747232036cd739fbf5a72a99afc4aaa	You could tell them, "My sister honestly, is not my responsibility, she is your daughter, thus your responsibility."

And request to them that they should not judge you based on her acts. Rather judge you for yours and her for hers. And they should punish her for her mistakes and not also punish you. Also that they need to make your sister realize that she is old enough to use her common sense to know what is right and wrong and that she should do that, rather than depend on you to be her common sense. And talk to your sister too and ask her to be a bit more considerate of you and parents. |`|buE4zX0Eaa	Sit your parents down, and really explain what you're feeling.

X495mZzqaa	My husband and I were in a similar situation.  He moved in with me before we married.  I made more money than him.  I didn't "share" my money with him.  I still don't really "share" my money.  He gives me $200 a week (which is very much within his budget) and I make sure all the bills are paid.  He gets to keep the rest of his check for whatever he chooses to spend it on.  (Honestly, we winds up with more "spending" money than me.)  It works best for us though.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I owned my house before we met.  He started out "renting" from me.  That way if worst came to worst and we didn't make it, it was still MY house.  I very much agree with that posters comment.  You are not married and don't plan on it (at least for a while, by your comment), so yeah I would definitely try to by the house buy myself first.  Especially since you are the one with most of the down payment.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Ye Gods...go and see a financial adviser now! Or the citizens advice bureau.|`|3arJsZ91aa	Regarding the potential joint ownership, see a solicitor to work out the detail.  Don't try to do this yourself.  If you explain the circumstances and how much you should own and he should own, they will draw up the contract for you.  As for bills, get a joint account (but also keep your own separate accounts too.  Get all bills on direct debit so that in general there is no need to access the account unless in an emergency.  As he will be living in the house with you, you should try to both pay the same amount of money in each month, so if the bills including mortgage come to ￡700 a month, both should pay at least ￡350 into the account.  If this is impossible for him due to his lower wage, then come to an agreement that you will pay (for example) ￡450 and he pays ￡250 until his wage increases sufficiently to cover half.  (Make him do all the washing up to compensate!!)|`|vgUO4LwZaa	Before u go too deep into this thing watch a few episodes of peoples court. You can watch it on you tube or have a friend tape it.

This situation all comes down to trust. Do you trust him enough particularly given you're the higher earner? Does the history of your relationship back up your answer to this?<br>  <br>  I would suggest if you want to jointly buy, you both put in 50%. Bills, well they are relatively small amounts in comparison to a mortgage, and carry less serious consequences should they not be paid. A house is an investment and will also be used to secure any future financial decisions about credit.  Instead of ploughing a higher amout of your expendable income into the house, use it to pay the bills instead. eg. you both pay 50/50 on the house, and you pay the bills. Or at least see how the bills work out and if necessary ask him to contribute to any that are large.<br>  <br>  That way things are far less complicated should it not work out, plus you both invest, you both stand to lose/keep your house and therefore also share any associated emotional stress should there be money problems (what if you lost your job?). The biggest flaw is that the whole plan would need to be re-organised if either of your salaries change dramatically - I assume he doesn't want to be on 16-20k for the rest of his life. What if in two years he's earning as much or more than you - and vice versa? The percentages wouldn't necessarily work out in terms of total mortgage+bill payments. You could end up not having enough or paying out way too much.<br>  <br>  Plus we all know that in general, men are a bit crap at organising bills!  <br>  <br>  I commend your sensibility in working this all out prior to buying, and I wish you both lots of happiness x  |`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you earn so much more than him then why not buy the house in your name alone and if anything goes wrong you dont have the problem of selling it.<br>  He could pay towards the mortgage as rent if you like then I would put a certain amount into a joint account, its not your fault if he is not earning as much as you he could look at it the other way and say its not fair you are putting more in than him if you do it on a percentage basis.<br>  If you were getting married then I would say get a joint mortgage but since you are the one earning more it makes sense that you buy the house and he lives there with you.|`|z6DCHxtAaa	if you are buying a house together, i hope this means you love each other and are going to get married, and in that case, just open one band account and take on each others debts, including the house debts and just spend what you have to so that you can have your lives together.

It's not without issues as we have different spending and saving priorities, but I try to keep track and we discuss it as we go along.<br>  <br>  It would be a nightmare to untangle if we ever separated, but working out in advance how we'd split things up seemed a little too much like calculating against the relationship working.|`|K8C14P7Caa	You should use percentages...if you both can live with that.  Even though he paid only 13% toward the purchase price, he will be paying towards the mortgage, taxes, etc.  He also can put in some sweat equity in maintaining the house, (painting, repairs, etc.) It is difficult even for married people to allocate the expenses, but it is less painful if you use percentages. If one partner can pay more, so be it.  He can take on a part time job to make up the difference.  Good for you and good question.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	make sure you draw up a contract at the solicitors before you buy the house together to ensure that you get back the same percentage of money (just in case you ever split up) that you put in. he will jointly own the house however much you each put in, its only when it comes to dividing it up again that there could be problems which is why I suggest a visit to the solicitors<br>  <br>  I would say that you should calculate how much each of you can afford to pay per month towards everything and pay that into a joint account and have everything paid out of that account by direct debit<br>  make sure you both allow yourselves enough money for what you need for your own personal spending and keep separate accounts for your 'left over'  money|`|ZPxJNpMxaa	My suggestion is this, his investment in  the home is 13% and the balance is yours.<br>  You pay the mortgage in full , but he carries 13% of the insurance premium on the home and pays 13% of all maintenance and repairs that u jointly agree to do. This way he only has a 13% share in the market value of the home if and when the relationship is dissolved.<br>  Then u need to draw up a budget for the running costs of the home,utilities,cleaning services, food etc and both contribute 50% into a joint account. In the event of a shortfall, both of you make this up with an equal contribution.<br>  You can then both decide how to separately invest and spend the balance of each of your incomes which will remain your individual investments.<br>  This way should the relationship break up you get a market value on the house pay him 13% of that and the house is all yours or sell the home and give him 13%.<br>  Yes, you must have a binding contract to protect yourselves in this regard.|`|agLImxKTaa	The best way to go about this legally is to just get married, then everything is 50/50.  You should have contracts and agreements drawn up otherwise.  It's very risky to share assets like this with someone you're not legally married to without something legal in place to protect you should it fail.  People in love don't think that one day you could break up and then what happens...  be realistic.  It IS a possibility.  |`|xRgxW2RPaa	I am not clear. Did you already have a mortgage ? Is he buying down 20k of the mortgage. Check with a lawyer about your possible loss if he decides to leave. There is such a vast difference in income. As far as monthly bills. You will equally be using home so repairs/upkeep should be split. He would have these bills for a place to live if he wasn't with you.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Do not put your money in a joint account unless you are married.

If he only puts in 13%, put that in writing; that's all he owns. As far as living costs, you can discuss how you want to divide that. I would not recommend joint accounts. You could either split everything 50/50 or have him just pay 13% of everything bill. The big question is whose name in the property going to be in; whose name is on the mortgage? Will it be joint or just you. If it is just you then you have the burden if things fall apart. Basically, you can do what you want just protect yourself and your assest as you have the most to lose in this. |`|AA11527539	Get legal advice, as whatever you decide may not be legally binding.<br>  <br>  Most relationships fail.

If you both own what you contribute, then there can be no problems in the future.<br>  <br>  An alternative would be for him to give you the money as a loan, and have you the sole owner, and pay for everything, and give him his cash back gradually.  Or to get a mortgage to cover his share.<br>  <br>  Having been through a separation, I am really glad that the ownership was in simple proportions, and we both agreed on exactly where we stood.|`|eP4RxP3raa	trouble ahead,unless you approach this as an Business Perhaps the best is for you to put in the same as your partner and borrow more than split the cost off mortgage and repair in half.If that does not work you could set it up in shares like each share 1% is worth 1500 dollar.Than when you sell some day you sell in shares as well or at some point may buy each other out in shares,what ever you do you must make a formal contract to prevent trouble later.
naequcqlaa	Maybe just the fact that you don't join in on their conversations about boys has kinda put you in their outer circle so to speak.  There's nothing wrong w/that, but they just might have the feeling that their conversations aren't that interesting to you, therefore they've left you on the side line.  Is there any one of them that you might be able to talk to & find out what the problem is?  Just talking to one & telling her you've got the feeling of being left out anymore & it's bothering/hurting you.   You miss their friendship & it's left you alone on the sidelines like you're on the outside looking in.  Try getting one of the friendlier girls you feel you can talk to more comfortably & see what she has to say about it.. They might not even be aware of what they're doing, but then like I said, they just might think you're not interested in their boy talk all the time not realizing you're being completely  left out.  Do this before the event comes up so you can get things straightened out before then.  They you won't have to get all stressed out & concerned about that anyway.  There has to be a reason for it, & since you haven't done or said anything differently than your norm I wouldn't be surprised if that isn't the reason.  That still is no reason for them to be treating you as they are tho.  They just haven't taken your feeling into consideration.  I feel once you find out what the problem is, things w/get back to the way they were.  There's nothing like the feeling of being lonely or left out when you once "belonged" to the same girls who now seem to be acting differently twds. you.  Get things straightened out w/one of them & I feel you'll be OK.  Best to you, honey...:)|`|4Vmlf902aa	Maybe it's time you got a new group of friends. |`|sWwugT91aa	well um maybe you can call them or ask them if they want to hang out with you sometimes. try to get them to do something with you. have them over at your house. show them that you are a fun person to hang out with, and DO NOT have sex!!!!!! |`|wQpdot1Raa	This happened to me.

Friends do not leave you out and talk about you behind your back.<br>  <br>  Look a little harder there are other people you can talk to:)|`|O7nA28hkaa	um...<br>  run!|`|7574d08431004feb940634df5ab1e8a7aa	You've gotten yourself in a difficult situation there. I think you need to find a new group of friends, one that will treat you better. However, it's better said than done. Especially in school where everyone already have their own groups already. These girls don't share the same interest as you, so that means you don't share the same interests as them. I think this might be the reason. I say just hang in there, and try to find a new/better group of friend as soon as possible. Don't change yourself so you can fit in with the group though, it's not worth it. School sucks, but what can you do right? I wish the best to you!|`|U56SKlloaa	I felt like that so I just gave up and went with some of my other friends who I knew wouldn't do anything like that to me.  If this leader is popular then there's probably no point hanging around her.  Our leader was a control freak and would get upset if you criticised nicely.  If there are some others in this group of friends that really like you then go off with them.  Hope this helped, Good Luck x|`|cLy7FhiCaa	It took me some time to learn friends come and go..Thats life. Your 16 in a couple of years everyone splits down there own paths. I only have like three friends left from my teenage years that I actually talk to all the time. Ive made a whole new lists of friends better friends now then what i woulda ever had then..but um guess just sayin if ur friends shuttin u out maybe there not the friend u thought they were and move on and make more..|`|lgmIStBXaa	omg forget them thats really shallow what school do you go to if i was your friend and you did something to piss me of i would talk to you really just get new friends because it's not worth it you're getting to tense and really friends are suppose to relax you and take you away from your problems but instead they are the ones causing you problems  and if it matter i  think you sound like a really awesome person|`|xMXOeEkRaa	Well if you really don't want to lose these girls as friends, I would say go to the one girl that you feel closest to and talk to her.  Tell her how you feel and what's been going on with you.  If she was truly your friend, she would listen and respond.  I think there's one thing that can go wrong with this. Girls are cruel and she could pretend to be listening to you and then go behind your back and just continue it all over again.  That has actually happened to me and we no longer are friends.  It's been years though since then.  Anyway if that happens and it just doesn't work out, find another group.  I know it's easier said than done, but I'm sure you have other friends in some of your classes that you can start getting closer to and then ask if you could sit at their lunch table and just hit it off from there.  Start hanging out and stuff.  You could also do this by joining a club or an afterschool activity.  You'd make a bunch of friends that way.  Good luck and do NOT let them get to you.|`|DvSyFE5caa	find better friends ,believe me trying to find the whole group is impossible,why don't you look for some one else,this world is full of people and i think you will find good friends soon|`|c1kbiDcxaa	i copped somthing simmilar/ i had a girlfriend at skool ditched all my friends during reces and wen we broke up 13 months later i lost all my boiz coz they found other groups but over time u wil find new friends or find the same people wil forgiv u and hang with u like they used 2|`|AA11354679	make new friends and hang out with them just because these other "so called friends" leave you out doesn't mean that the world is against you get out and live your life Kiddo!!!!|`|5eb7PotHaa	be a leader not a follower you don't need them start making new friends true friends will always be there foe you|`|WuojbM3Haa	Yo-ung is right I think|`|2zXudIx1aa	oh boy, you need sex.|`|j5SEfhtWaa	ask them what the is going on.....|`|9oijjEkvaa	Ignore the guy who said you need sex.  He obviously isa pig!  My advice to you is to ask your friend strait out.  "I want to ask you honestly if there is a reason you are not hanging our with me anymore, did I offend you somehow?"  you can chose your own words of course.  Just be honest, bust remember that it is ok, maybe you need to move on to friends who have more to them.  You do not need to be around shallow girls.  When I was in High School I did not act goofy and boy crazy like some of my friends.  We just drifted apart and it was ok with me, I really did not care because I did not like to do the same things as them.  Now I am a married women with 7 beautiful children those friends are now divorced or still partying or their kids are a mess.  They never grew up.  Just go with the flow of things and make new friends let them talk who cares you are still you.  Ask God to give you strength and peace through this time.  You will look back soon and have gotten through it fine.  Good Luck and God Bless you.|`|DsPEEiU0aa	wow!!<br>  first of all...obviously these friends of your arent real friends.<br>  and if you would like to fix this the only way YOU could TRY to would be to str8 up go infront them ask them whats wrong & what's that you did that they obvilously disapproved of.<br>  & if for some reason that does not work out..dont waste your time kissing their butts trying to fit in.<br>  Im sure you can make new & better friends.<br>  Slowly but surely you can =]]<br>  & if all they do is talk bout boys which of course u are not intrested in talking about well i assume you are uncomfortable being around them im in a situation kind of like this where im just there alone listening but i've known how to choose my friends...=]<br>  && with that speica event coming up...dont let them ruin it for you.<br>  trust me you dont need them...<br>  make new friends..or go alone even if you'll think you'll look dumb goin alone...the day might get better =]]<br>  good luck!|`|uQAAPf29aa	First of all think about if there is anything at all you did for them to treat you this way. If not, then they are pathetic. And Expecially cause of the fact that they haven't even explained to you the reason why they are acting like that towards you. If you really care that much about your friendship with these girls then talk to them about it. Ask them whats up and why they're acting like that towards you. This kind of stuff is normal and i've been through it like 100 times. It seems like the end of the world right now but trust me, in 10 years your gonna look back and think that it was the stupidest thing and you're not even gonna give a **** about any of them or this thing comeing up. So just talk to them about it and tell them how you feel and if they act stupid about it then as hard as it seems, realize that they're all just immature for giving up your friendship and treating you like they have.
68msDkYUaa	hi,<br>  <br>  there is nothing wrong in making love ,, but be sure if u just like him or u are actually in love.. just dont give urself for a crush or liking make sure u love him n he loves u .. tk cr swtzz and plzz dont rush in :)|`|d08c2ff1d2c6a46f4309339f29ed68c4aa	OMG!<br>  If you do this, you should be slapped.<br>  You'll be known as the school slut.<br>  OMG! I can't believe you would give up your virginity to a guy that says "hey I'd TAP you." what a pig, thats no way to treat a woman, and in your case a girl.<br>  Ladies deserve so much more than that.<br>  He's a player and like he says just wants to tap that<br>  what a pig what a thug what a loser.<br>  This wont be a relationship, if it get to be a realationship it wont be long term, and to  give it up to this pig.....OMG.....<br>  Save it for someone that cares about you, that will put you on a pedistal.......<br>  OMG.....i dont know what else to say ......OMG|`|zovcvRGIaa	If you have to ask in general I say no. If you're really a confident as casual as you seem though, then go for it. be careful and also be prepared for regrets.|`|645f5e5b92c50e68977177e97d78d7feaa	Maybe.|`|1LUZDn5laa	Well it depends on how old you are for starters and also on how ready you are for this. You only have one virginity love, so be sure. Also if you do, be safe, make sure he uses a condom and maybe even consider the pill if you are gonna make a habit of it :P<br>  Im in a similar position to you, in highschool, in the more 'outgoing' group at school so to speak and am very ready to lose the 'v' plates cause at the moment i'v done everything but sex. <br>  Good luck :)|`|uiq4FQIiaa	In life you are either 2 things<br>  <br>  a pig<br>  <br>  a nice girl<br>  <br>  seriously as much of a guy i am and would prolly "tap that" he will leave you.<br>  <br>  trust i know from experience, the girls get a bad rep, and the boy becomes the man of the town. it doesnt matter how close your friends are, no one wants a real easy girl as their friend<br>  <br>  well all in all, i understand you are filled with hormones and every other girl is losing her V card, but dont listen to that<br>  <br>  "omg 1 lifetime sex experience, heart the person you love"<br>  <br>  the first time you do it you dont even care until after you are done, like in a week (for boys) <br>  <br>  trust me as a guy we learn to forget and although you may or may not be his first one, trust me he will forget you|`|PQmMAUFXaa	Honey, trust me, you don't want your first time to be with someone who just wants to "tap" you anyday.  Your first time is really special and you will never forget it.  Don't just rush out and do it with the first one that comes along.  You will be sorry in the long run.  And if you are still in school, you are much too young to be worried about things like sex right now anyway.  It isn't all it's cracked up to be, and if you run out and give yourself to someone now, you might get the reputation of being "easy".  Do you want that??  I speak from experience.  Don't make the same mistakes I did.  Make it special.  Don't rush, just because someone thinks you're hot.  And if you do decide to do it anyway, use a condom.  Babies and STD's are not on your top lists at the moment.|`|97LsZPHtaa	I'd tap that is kind of a rude thing to say about someone.  You should be in a relationship, be in love before you give away your virginity.  You can't ever get it back.  Sex is not all its cracked up to be, and us girls tend to devote our hearts when we do...especially our virginity... if he is willing to love you, and you love him, then maybe you guys can talk about it, but if you are just wanting to sleep w/ him to sleep w/ him. i wouldn't advise that.  You don't want give it up that easy... it will effect your reputation, and the way you look at yourself.  The day will come, be patient, you will know...u wont have to ask anyone's advice...especially strangers, try talking to someone you trust, like an older sister, or a friend.. or if you can maybe your mom.  Good luck, and be strong!! Don't have sex w/ him bc you think he will like u if u do...u will be disappointed|`|AA12331613	sweetie if he went around talking about him having to empty his own tank ( which is not right) well can you actually imagine what it would be like if you actually have sex with him ? He sounds immature and dont rush into it because you might regret it later. Take it easy|`|ovaRPeBYaa	for sure I would say no,,,, at least until you turn 18 but you know young ppl the get the pressure and good bye!|`|HCfJIpNGaa	yeah u should. everything will start looking up|`|CsLl20tpaa	if you want it, why not? dont get pregnant though!|`|iCFrIrKzaa	If you are serious and really "want to just get rid of the v's and have fun"" then you should DO IT! <br>  <br>  You will have more fun than you can imagine! Plus it sounds like he's even willing to tap you anytime you want! You can't beat that offer from a sexy guy! The other girls will wish that they were you!<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|54cb9873b5feb460d92e2213034ba2f5aa	No, a man like that wants only to have sex with you, thats it. You may think he is great now, but this guy sounds like a creep who wont care about you the next day. What happens if you get pregnant or get an STD because of a one night stand, this guy isnt going to be around to help you through it, guarenteed!|`|lS71hgDRaa	only if YOU'RE ready.<br>  sex isn't something to be foolish with.<br>  it comes with many responsibilities as well as unknown routes that could lead you to regret.<br>  <br>  make sure you're ready for the right reasons, and hey, if so, then have fun!<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|zZ9Z0xWHaa	That all depends on what grade you're in.

hVJDEmHgaa	The fact that you keep dreaming about your ex doesn't mean you are still in love with him, so don't worry about that.  You obviously have some unresolved issues that are subconsiously bothering you, but since you are pregnant and pregnant women can be very emotional and hormonal (I have a 3 month old) I would question whether this is the correct time to address any issues with your ex.  When I was pregnant I had extremely vivid, repetitive dreams like that.  The good news is that they go away for the most part after the baby is born (when you don't get to dream much at all because you hardly ever get to sleep:)  I'm pretty sure it has to do with the hormones of pregnancy.  Rest assured that dreams can be very deceiving like that; don't start second guessing the current relationship you are in based on dreams.  The fact that you don't dream about your current partner probably says that you are very secure in this current relationship and don't need to spend time pondering your partner while asleep.  |`|wSghqr95aa	I think it depends on what your doing in the dream not so much about who is in the dream... are you running from something, what are you feeling in the dream  ?  Maybe you miss haveing that friendship?|`|VgLltdtPaa	  Two years is a long time to invest in a guy and it doesn't work out.  You didn't tell us why you two split up so we are all in the dark there.    I hope you're not having problems with the guy that you're with.  When the baby arrives you will be so busy your dreams wont have a chance.|`|AA11608353	the answer is too long to explain here... sorry |`|AA11885325	I dont believe in dreams having some kind of guide or interpretation on how life should be if thats what you mean..its just thoughts and memories you once had or (still having) thats filed in your mind and your mind takes them and creates stories or dreams while you are sleeping....so you either still think about your ex or use to think about him a lot in the past and hes just coming up in your dreams...you cant erase past memeories even if you try not to think about them they will still find a way to show up!|`|2TgvETGmaa	i really don't know, but do you have any secrets about your ex or are you getting cold feet or maybe you still have some feelings about your ex? sometimes, the last thing i think about before i sleep is what i dream about. so think really hard about your fiancee or butterflies and ponies and maybe that will get rid of him.|`|V4DWem2Paa	Maybe your ex was just really important to you and touched your soul.  But that doesn't mean that they guy you're with now isn't the right guy for you.  Try to shrug off the dreams and concentrate on your baby and your new life :]|`|020da44201ce3179c8e121351d527a8daa	Do you still have feelings for ur ex?<br>  Dreams are just dreams dont worry about it girl.<br>  reality is way more important! especially if ur havin <br>  a baby! how exciting!!! <br>  Congrats.<br>  forget bout ur ex!
UYJJfOUOaa	You have to find out why he switch. If his switch is something uncontrollable, then you have to weigh whether you can accept him for long-term, if you cant, you situation would be like in a rocking ship and you're seasick, cant get off and suffering. If it is something you guys can work out, then by all means do, of course both of you must make an effort. It's not easy to make him talk, try to ease him down and approach him slowly. |`|QhiZ7ZlCaa	HE SOUNDS LIKE A POOK FJFSJBVJIVJ<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I THINK HUihlD\IHLFAFMNFINOAJFVUVJVIKJVOI;JSIVJI...|`|gvP3bfFMaa	I'm afraid Ruth is right! talk to him..

I'd never consider being friends with my ex though, too much drama there. |`|EkaX4GdAaa	I think he does this to get into your head. But maybe he is ready to move on. He can't get a new girlfriend if you are always around.  And seeing you all the time is more or less of a annoyance for both of you. Exgirlfriends are always jealous of new girlfriends. What is even worse is when exgirlfriends try to be best friends with your current girlfriends.|`|VEEgoDkFaa	It sounds like he's trying to get a reaction from you.

Well, no, but maybe it was a mutual breakup, but one of ya still had feelings for eachother and regreted it. So instead of pretending like nothing ever happend, it did happened, and it is almost like trust was broken when it wan't.

Relax.|`|gerSWMvBaa	just be her friend, but usually when she says that she just wants to be friends, that's it, just try and show her how great you are, and she MIGHT change her mind.

There is no bigger gift than this.
6gv0Igq0aa	Yeah, I think that is the right thing since you already have mentioned it to him and he still did it again.This is a respect thing.He isn't respecting you, and he really should since you have brought this to his attention.If he finds out you went somewhere and didn't invite him,tell him the honest truth why and that is the right thing to do for sure.Maybe that will make him think more about it and he will stop eventually.|`|9ZR9b5Ceaa	yes you are - he's taking advantage of your kindness and friendship by trying to make you look bad in front of others. NO ONE deserves a friend like that. Maybe if you ignore him long enough he'll get the picture and get his act together - but don't be surprised if he doesn't. In the end - you shouldn't have to sacrifice your friendships and reputation for someone that isn't going to appreciate you - good luck!|`|VLtMuMrCaa	confront him|`|i6iBWNX4aa	yea i guess u good but did u ever wonder thats how he mostly acts wit his friends n that why he hardly has any|`|zniTFxebaa	I think what you are doing is good because you asked him to stop but he contiued. Don't invite him and don't hang out with him at all until he says he is sorry and proves to you that he won't do that anymore. I hope this helped.<br>  <br>  -Tara :)
8UVgMMx6aa	one day before u should order a nice cake .without knowing to ur friend.and dont create birthday climate bofore that day .all are behave like "u dont know about his birthday".suddenly at midnight 12pm power is gone i mean u just off the main switch all this is done naturally.and then all ur friends bring that cake  with shining candles.  and hug him say birthday wishes in ur way.   All this is dramatical  but this is the good way.     <br>    and  advance birthday wishes to ur friend.<br>  <br>                                                                  .Good luck
NsWEehiFaa	I know you don't want to sound hateful or anything like that but you have to think about what's good for you sometimes and not others. It your money, you worked for it. I can see giving your dad a few bucks every now and then but nothing major like a hundred bucks! That's asking for too much. Unless he pays you back. You should tell him;<br>  <br>  "Hey dad I'll let you borrow some money, just pay me back okay?" <br>  That way your still being generous but also smart. That way you'll get your money back. Now if he says he'll pay you back but really doesn't then next time he asks for money simply tell him; <br>  <br>  "No dad, last time I lent you money you never paid me back I just can't afford to be giving you money all the time and never receiving any back"<br>  <br>  This is what I would do in your situation. <br>  You should never let anyone walk over you, even your family.<br>  I hope I've helped.<br>  |`|5eb7PotHaa	tell him you have a girlfriend and spend all your money on me.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Just say NO!  Let your family believe what they want to.  You owe them nothing, so why pay for the love they hold over your head?  |`|ioLun57Caa	Plain and simple: CYA<br>  send dad packing|`|a0c102b8ca14a50e8e38a99b46dd5505aa	Oh.  I guess you and I share the same father!  Sounds very much the same.<br>  <br>  Tell the moocher that with the downturn of the economy, you can not pay his debts.  You have to take care of your own.  Sorry, but no can do!|`|W3u8qCbhaa	just shell out what you can afford. well that is just me.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Tell your dad that even though you make a lot of money you don't have a lot to spare because he was unable to help with your schooling. Tell him about not being able to pay your bills if you give him money and that it just isn't going to happen. You don't owe this man anything. If he had spent his whole life working to put you through college or support you at all I would say give him the money but it sounds like he has always looked out for number one and only number one.|`|wNSW0zCMaa	You don't owe anybody anything. If you don't feel right giving out money then don't do it. You know you're own finances and family better than anyone on here. You need to decide for yourself. If you give him money, chances are he'll just come back and hit up for even more next time. Be careful, I know he's your dad, but he doesn't sound like a good guy at all to me.<br>  <br>  Or on a lighter note, next time you go home, ask them for money. Complain that economy is just so bad and even you are struggling. That might help. Good luck.
cf41e4a0d5d45f37138b129149517217aa	first of all before helping her u should stop believing that she is ugly, how can u help her if u yourself think so lowly of her. besides y don't u tell her o go on line and check some beauty tips.|`|N9ujqRj0aa	Find an ugly guy..............but she is ugly and only wants handsome dudes right?   Good luck!|`|NMowJnIcaa	well for one thing...thats kinda fucked up that you would call your friend ugly....just do a total makeover on her...and dont tell her shes ugly or her self essteem will go lower and make her uglier
HpPMChCEaa	Definitely sounds like he likes you a lot as a close friend. Could that lead into something more? Of course but that being said it would take either you or him to make a step and take that risk. From the sounds of it, doesn't seem like he's playing games with you. But let me just warn you from a recent experience (getting in a relationship with a friend), getting back to a friendship if things don't work out is really really awkward and hard. So good luck and be careful with that friendship if you really value it.
6UcLOCE2aa	La soledad es un sentimiento de ausencia de compa?ía que entristece y produce pena, solo se puede quitar llenando ese vacío de algo o alguien. <br>  <br>  De todos modos suele ser una sensación subjetiva, uno puede esta muy acompa?ado, y sentirse solo porque quiere vivir sólo en su intimidad, o al revés, estar en una isla desierta y sentir la cercanía y el cari?o de muchas personas.<br>  <br>  Pienso que todos tenemos siempre la cercanía de Dios con el que podemos dialogar en nuestro interior y que nos da la fuerza para salir de situaciones en que por la circunstancia que sea hay  en nuestra vida una carencia afectiva.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado hay que salir de uno mismo, y lanzarse a foros, reuniones, tertulias de amigos que además de ayudar hace que uno mismo se sienta necesario y de ayuda para los demás.

There cannot be any sexual touching or groping and it cannot be just a warm up for sex.  It's called a good old-fashioned make-out session. You can only stroke your partner's hair, cheek, neck or shoulder. Kissing each other for 15 - 20 minutes shows them how much you care about them and enjoy the time you spend together. It really gives the relationship an emotional boost.|`|Px3xEYrKaa	well to some people in highschool it is like a routine procedure and they don't care who with, just as long as they do, so basically it means nothing. Then there are the people who never makeout and when they do it happens rarely and only with people they truly, truly love. In this case, it means a whole lot.

K01FEsSxaa	I live alone, and I have the same problem. I usually get my milk from the convenient store in those little 20 oz bottles, kind of like they have for cokes. As for bread, I always get the small loaf, it's like half a loaf, but it usually goes bad on me, so I don't buy bread often. But eggs, eggs don't go bad for a long time, even if the date is out, the eggs are usually ok because they're contained in the shell so no germs can get in. I do have trouble, but what I usually do is just order more than I can eat when i'm at a restaurant, then just take it home in a togo box and eat it for lunch or dinner the next day.|`|SiWUjLFXaa	Well they should have smaller gallons of milk like in the carton. And I know for sure they sell small things of cereal. And if you go to a smaller grocery store they have a half dozen of eggs. I mean also if you want to make pasta dont cook the entire box of noodles and dont use an entire jar of sauce.

vQuwykoeaa	ahhh, seriously i thought i was the only one with this problem.lol my bf is totally the same. usually if we go to a party or something he says nothing and chills by himself, it was super annoying. usually now though i just have to be really patient, if we go to a party i always try to hang out with him for like an hour before we go, we just chill and idk i just try to make him feel really secure...(most of my friends are guys so it makes him nervouse that ill leave him:p) ill give him a kiss and tell him i love him and slowly he gets better. then when we're there ill hang out with him for a bit but if he feels ok he'll find one of the guys and start talking and laughing. so esentially he's like a little kid that you have to make safe before you go. also sometimes if he's struggling and getting clingy then he just chills with me and i do the talking and he makes comments, he just need to be made comfortable...maybe if the parties lame leave a bit early and go back to his place....this is super long i hope it kinda helped|`|5yUUVd3maa	well some guys are just like that im afraid. he feels he has nothing to say with your friends and family. i can relate.<br>  but he deffinatly can change. just find common ground for them to talk on. music is normally great. if not, sports? anything that will get a conversation running. <br>  good luck ^.^

qzX1bNfMaa	Say what you want him to do, be specific, use dirty words, ask him what he wants you to do, be specific. Have fun.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	The Basics:<br>  <br>  Sex is an act of possession. The guy is saying to the girl (non-verbally) "You are mine!". The girl is saying back to the guy "That is correct!" Thats the nonverbal communciation that occurs. Man possessing, Woman validating.<br>  <br>  So your verbal communication should follow this format. When a guy talks dirty to a girl, it usually involves either (PG rated)<br>  <br>  a) Statement of possession "Your (blank) feels so good"<br>  <br>  b) Request for Validation.  "Feels good doesn't it?"<br>  <br>  When a girl talks dirty to a guy, its either <br>  a) Invitation of Possession  "you want me don't you?"<br>  b) Statement of Validation "It's HUGE!" <br>  <br>  So when you're talking to him, stroke his ego. Give him validation. Most men are amatures until they meet a woman who gives them confidence. Talk up his game and you'll get better game. <br>  <br>  |`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well you can tell him you like what he is doing.

aygCn7QDaa	I wouldn't know unless I was in that exact situation. But if she's treating you like that, then "flips out" after finding out you're dating someone else...then has dinner with you...it sounds like she's just hanging onto you as an option. She may be seeing someone else, for all you know...And from what you wrote it sounds like both of you are ready for someone new. You may not accept it just now, but it's true.|`|6dDS6dnOaa	No, not at all.  You're a good person, man.  You went through a double-hell: a peek into long-distance relationships, and seeing how people can change when they take a new step in their lives.   I've had both a long distance relationship, and had a girlfriend change when she took a new step in her life.  But never in the same person; so my heart goes out to you for feeling both at the same time.   The feeling of powerlessness must have been overwhelming.  <br>  <br>     Here's why this isn't all your fault.  You did the right thing keeping in contact with her, sending her things that would comfort and support her while she was away.  Don't be too hard on yourself if you let too much of your emotions come out while she was away, and made it kind of hard for her to adjust.  This happens in a lot of long distance relationships.  When the support and understanding wasn't going equal both ways when I dated a girl far away, it was easy for things to get complicated, real fast.  <br>  <br>       You didn't drive her to dump you.  She planned her future with you.  She asked for a promise ring.  She wanted you to be there for her.  And you were.  Albeit you're not a perfect human being, and could have done things better, but the fact is that you tried, man.  You did the absolute right thing in trying to move on too, when she dumped you the first time.  Those are powerful, powerful words when someone says "it's over".  They're no joke, and they hurt.  <br>  <br>    This isn't all her fault, but she shares the heavy load of the blame for how things went down.  She could have easily said "let's just take a break until I get home".  When you guys have dinner, let her know you still have feelings for her (if you do), and if she wants to let one summer bring down an amazing 7 month relationship, then that's her choice.  That when she said it's over, you believed her.  And that you won't play games like that, because you'd never do that to her.  If you're getting vibes that she's sending mixed messages at the dinner, or she's not committing to what you guys had, then she's not being honest.  The truth will always be clear, no matter how much it hurts.  If you're feeling uncertainty from her, cut the ties.  You're the one who wants to make things work; it has to go both ways, or you're setting yourself up for a deep cut.  <br>  <br>    Be strong.  You did the right thing.|`|W39bd1TXaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  NOTE: This is my personal opinion. Please use advice at your own discretion . I am not a professional. This answer is not intended at all to be offensive in any way.<br>  <br>  All right. <br>  <br>  If you want my REAL personal opinion: Okay, its NOT your fault. Honestly. She is giving you mixed messages. When you like her, she doesn't like you, but when you like someone else, she won't let you date her...<br>  Confusing, huh? Oh, and by the way, SHE broke up with YOU. Its not your fault she decided to break up, and then doesn't let you move on! Unless you did something really bad (like cheat on her, etc.) then I don't see why you should feel guilty.<br>  <br>  If you want my INDIFFERENT opinon: Well, your ex-girlfriend might be going through some emotional times; moving away, etc. But it still isn't your fault she felt the need to break up with you. That was her choice. She might have regretted it (wanting to take you back, not letting you date other girls). I think you should talk to her, ask her for her honest feelings, at the dinner date. <br>  <br>  If you want the BOTTOM LINE: Talk to her, be honest, and expect honesty in return. Don't feel guilty for something you had no control over.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck. I hope this wins Best Answer!

They won't like that in court. |`|1Byis7Flaa	Be honest with yourself.<br>  <br>  Are you playing games with him?<br>  <br>  Are you being honest with him?<br>  <br>  Is there another guy?<br>  <br>  Does he feel bad or ashamed that you are the bread winner and he is not?<br>  <br>  Try to ask yourself these things before you make a huge mistake by leaving or having him leave.<br>  <br>  With that said, you still want it to be over, write him a note, and you leave... and make plans to pick up your things later.<br>  <br>  And don't just take everything or make him leave since it is you who wants the marraige to be over.  You should leave.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	OK, you already know the answer to this question, don't you?  This relationship is OVER.  But since he has made threats to kill you, you need to involve the law, as well as a divorce lawyer.  They will give you the advice you need to make sure you and your children are safe.<br>  <br>  You have no business "still loving" someone who threatens to kill you.  Get yourself and your children to counseling to help heal the damage this man has undoubtedly done!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and God bless.|`|lvwY0ZYcaa	You need to leave before you get hurt.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Time to kick his @ss out.  YOu will be fine:)|`|c2cTvAlqaa	If you don't get out, things are ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. Without any indication that your husband recognizes that he has a problem and that he is also willing to fix it, your only option - if you want your heart, your mental health, and your children intact - is to get out while you still have the opportunity.<br>  <br>  Get an attorney. Fast. And if he threatens you again before you go, call the police, if not for yourself, do it for your children. It's your job to keep them safe, and just because he's not phsycially abusing them doesn' t mean he isn't doing any damage!<br>  <br>  Think with your head, not with your heart. Your heart will mend, and so will your children, but only if you put them first.|`|RjXmqFjCaa	If your the bread winner then leave! what is wrong with you? your kids are number 1 priority you are putting them through this emotional roller coaster ride now stop it and just leave, you can get a restraining order to where he can't come near your kids you or your home, specify kids in the restraining order and they will damn sure take it serious enough to keep and constant eye on him. How in the world could you love a man like this? I am sorry but I am mad! there are men out there slaughtering their entire families and here you are telling me you love him, what! leave before something really bad happens, he needs help! JAIL is good for helping men like this. God Bless and do it the right thing by your kids.|`|BwwFAdBSaa	This certainly is a tough situation, but in all honesty you have to leave him. Go and stay with family or friends, somewhere you will be safe and get the ball rolling with a divorce, you will find it hard but in the long run you will realize you made the right decision, if not for you, then for your children!|`|DqT3ZuByaa	0808 2000 247 this is the womens aid phone number.<br>  they can help and give you advice of how to get out of this marriage.<br>  You dont have to be "hit" to be classed as domestic abuse... he is already doing that to you with threatening you.<br>  No offencr but he sounds like he has some major problems so i suggest giving this number  cll and asking them for the best option.<br>  they are a very good compny|`|AA11328507	Your a professional woman?

Divorce him!!|`|mgwiuZT0aa	Is it so bad out here that you have to settle for a man that pays 10% of bills and is disrespectful? What do you really love about him? What are you teaching your children by allowing this man to disrespect you? I bet he is breaking your stuff and you're replacing it.|`|1qhrmZLWaa	You don't love him.  You love the high.  <br>  <br>  The first step, as they say, is admitting you have a problem.<br>  <br>  You're addicted to love.<br>  <br>  |`|bHqPnZ6Laa	Let the rest of your family know whats going on. That way they can help you. But definitely leave him. Its not worth it. |`|3e517d704e865c18d41cfcc10a0a4bc6aa	Abuse is abuse. There is emotional abuse, physical abuse and mental abuse. No matter how you look at it he is hurting you and your children. My suggestion is to get out while you can, I assume that he does not work since you are paying the majority of the bills. I was in this same situation. I packed all of his things, called his brother to come and get him, and had the police there while it was going on. I also taped him threatening me so that I would have proof. I went and filed for the divorce, got the restraining order and put him out. Either that or you need to take your children, leave him and start over. I would hate for anything to happen to you or your children. Most abusive people start out just throwing things, He will wind up hitting you or your kids before it is over. |`|AA10093999	This is not a you will be fine or you are into submission thing. That is bullshit.<br>  <br>  However, you are in the classic abuse situation. Was your father like this man? Typically we seek out a certain type subconsciously. While this is not 100% all of the time, it is usually a good indicator of how we behave and choose. <br>  <br>  He is not acting like a "proper" man. If you are not happy you need to leave him. I know it will not be easy, but you need to find the support. My gut feeling is that you will get less happy and he will get more violent.|`|yYZh3MSTaa	It don't get better I have been there.  You can make it own your on. I did three kids you can too. You say you pay 90%  the bills. Go to a lawer and get on with you life.|`|595a5dc4b6a105b7cbfed1d8971f794aaa	To start with you are not at fault for any of this and Prayer is in order. You seem to be in an abusive relationship and need either counseling or a Divorce. Your husband needs anger management. If this is a constant thing and has been going on for a while you need to get help now before it gets to become physical. If it just recently started you might want to check and make sure that your Husband has not started taking on extra activities (FROWN). There is definitely wrong with this kind of behavior and it needs to be confronted. If you feel threatened you need to find someone to be a divider while you two come to a Solution to this Very Dangerous behavior. A marriage is about Love and Respect and his behavior doesn't show any respect for you or your feelings. The children should not be subject to this and neither should you. You make all the money and that is probably the reason he doesn't want you to leave but that is your best option for you and the children. You need by getting a restraining order of protection.

Is your boyfriend that you have now your best friend? Probably not, right? To be honest, a boyfriend is just a boyfriend and there's nothing much to it except sex. It sounds to me like your best friend who is a guy has strong feelings for you and you for him. If you and he should get together, it will be the best type of relationship you will ever experience because you have your best friend and boyfriend in the same person. Think of him as your future husband.|`|vadxW5Caaa	What does your heart tell you?  If you love your best friend, why are you with someone else?  Are you worried your best friend won't "work out"?

DIebEIw7aa	How could you adore someone if you see your life with him / her is going to be  tears of sadness or caused you so much pain?,You see the points are adorable people has it all...  or if not, at least, he/she are almost perfect in every angle, for that, all your expectations in life,revolve with her/him.  admiring someone & found him/her adorable doesn't mean you love them 'coz its not in there yet,the decision is always either yes or no,your awareness is positively active,so how could you be blinded by that?, satisfaction & love are even questionable,how could someone be satisfied w/out love?,unless he/she doesn't have a heart..desperately looking for something...ended with a "broken heart". Its true,love has its own foundation,when it comes to controlling your emotions...that's why you cannot feel any satisfactions w/out love, there is always lacking inside you ,these kinds of emotions,won't give you peace of contentment 'till you find the real meaning of " LOVE", so trading b/n these two are just impossible . Everything that's make you feel happy & satisfied is definitely worth more than anything else...people yearn for happiness that's the purpose in life..fill your heart with love & to be loved...can't imagine what the world might be, without it. You would benefit wonderful things & memories for someone who has the quality to be adore, what are those characteristics? Good people, interesting individuals, who doesn't have the capability of hurting & destroying other lives.I cannot allow any negative thoughts on this,for no one would say...I adore this guy, but he is so bad...etc.(Of course, the indications of that is heartaches) and the benefit you could get is not something so adorable anymore...hopefully sweetie..I clear-up your mind a little bit here.. or maybe, worst..:) ,thanks anyway....

Make sure she doesn't feel like you are attacking her, or she might not take you seriously. Ask her to get help from an addiction specialist or a therapist.

I still don't really understand it; I've never used attractiveness as a criterion for involvement. Most of the men I've been involved with were very average and I hardly noticed. It made me feel very shallow to care about this man's looks at all, but I did. Thank god I finally got out of it. He was a sociopath.<br>  <br>  As for your question, I wasn't intimidated by his looks; I had no difficulty interacting with him without getting nervous (I don't get nervous about things like that). I just gave his looks much more weight than I should've and stuck with him for too long.|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	I believe when there is a attraction to someone there is a nervousness.|`|80a536a84383939b648ebf43505d434faa	It's the kiss of death, only if you're a man, and attracted to another man, are if you're married and looking for stimulating from another person....same goes for another woman..|`|2r8iRceQaa	I see what you mean.

He had knocked my books down and was laughing because i had tripped. The guy who was nice was actually one of his friends. He said that he wasn't friends who traeted girls with disrespect and he seriously walked away.... It turned out that the mean guy liked me. I don't and didn't like him.... I ended up with the nice guy... |`|EuYPuvgAaa	too many to even say.|`|CitsGk8Gaa	he sang to me<br>  unfortunately one of his backup singers was the one i wanted to go out with, which we did |`|6XsuV1EEaa	When my mom was dying, I went from the airport to her room and stayed by her side until the morning she died for 3 weeks. Everyone else tried to get me out a few times, but I was afraid she would die alone. My good friend Teresa came and sat with me in the hospital and even stroked my mom's hair and talked to her. She also sent flowers and came to the funeral. Also a couple of church members would go sit with my mom at the beginning of her illness when I couldn't get to Texas, I live in Atlanta. They bought her a portable cd player and gospel Cd's and spoke to her and prayed with her. I know my mom appreciated all the love, I know I did.<br>  <br>  Maybe these things are not considered cute, but it felt great that people can care so much.|`|inydEbmeaa	Hmmm.. <br>  Well..<br>  The cutest thing that one of my friends have done for me was on Valentine's day earlier this year.<br>  My friend Stephanie bought my a cute black Voodoo doll with flaming pink hair and button eyes from Target. It had a bag of bone and skull shaped candy tied to its wrist.<br>  Best Valentine's present ever.<br>  :)<br>  |`|d3gJoYVNaa	well, one of   my friend her boyfriend gave her a stuff teddey bear that said l love u and the other one gave my friend a heart necklace |`|TAr657RJaa	it sound cheesy but he won me a prize at one of those impossible fair games|`|Xo2EdoEGaa	He watched chick flicks with me when i was sad :)
AA10473705	Much of life is risk. But not many look for it in a marriage. If you cannot ask him questions and not be totally reassured of his answers, or actions, then did you marry the right guy? I will assume you did marry the right guy, but maybe you are insecure. What comes next? Asking him who he is sleeping with? Following him around during the day? Don't let this become a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br>  <br>  If you just have a nosey nature, try looking into a different job, like private detective or news reporter and not satisfy this need on someone who may be offended at you asking for pay of these services.|`|ffb42367736232c58e1232280031062aaa	you might have too much time on your hands? I mean, where is he when your snooping? Why dont you just get on YA instead....lol|`|X0EgEU7baa	Have you ever found a reason to do this?  Has he cheated or somethin?<br>  <br>  If not then you need to trust him.  Maybe seek counseling?
y9CgveCGaa	Your marriage sounds pretty one way to me.  I'd leave a lot of those chores for her to do.  Especially the ones that directly impact her.  If I was you the uniform thing would be out the window immediately.  If she won't renegotiate the relationship you should do it unilaterally.|`|AA12272885	To be blunt, now you know how a lot of women feel when they do the majority of the work in the home with no apprecation or recognition of effort.  They too try very hard to get their husbands to notice or say something but it may not happen.  They are taken for granted and the guy just doesn't get it.  <br>  Not that all marriages are like that, and they certainly shouldn't be.  I think I just lost a guy friend for much the reasons you have outlined.  I didn't realize what I was doing at the time, but on looking back I see that I just wasn't attuned to his feelings, I didn't reassure him about how attractive he was when he on occasion put himself down.  I didn't compliment the meals he cooked.  I wasn't appreciative of the nice things he did.  It is only now looking back that I see how I could have done things differently.  He never said a word so I don't know if that is the  reason, but I really have regrets.  <br>  I guess what I am saying is that if your wife loses you she may begin to  see what she should have done,  but if it doesn't happen she may never examine what she does to hurt you and how much she is ignoring your feelings.  <br>  I believe you need to seek counseling, if she won't go then go alone.  You may find ways of  dealing with her attitude.  Good luck.   |`|bpjpD7W3aa	Stop cooking, only do yours and the child's laundry, why are you her slave? Chances are if anyone cheats it will be her. Now is the time to man up. Force her to respect you.|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	Marriage is most necessary and you should wait when a woman shall meet you and a love shall take its birth in two hearts at one and the same time.|`|AA10867564	There's nothing you can do. It's immoral and unethical to trade anything for sex. That you bring home a paycheck and do chores is great, but expecting sex in return is not right. About the only advice I can give you is: think of what other great people have done:<br>  <br>  Galileo<br>  Einstein<br>  Thomas <br>  <br>  Alva Edison<br>  <br>  Henry Ford<br>  Orenthal James Simpson<br>  Orel Herschiser<br>  Kennedy<br>  Edgerin James<br>  Rodney King<br>  !<br>  <br>  |`|abyHvk07aa	You made a comment that no other women would want you. Why is that? If you know there are things about you that are clearly a turn off to women then change them. I suggest buying a book called, The Proper Care and Feeding of Your Husband and getting a woman to give it to her. You can't go it. She won't read it. But if a woman says...i read this book and it changed my marriage, she just might. I commend you for not wanting to have an affair. It's not a good answer. But maybe you also need to tell her just HOW unhappy you are and that if you don't see a counselor you two probably wont be together much longer. |`|1IkBqSzeaa	Wow, you do all this tasks and provide for your wife and she still complains. What is wrong with her?. Women like her make me very upset cause they don't know how to appreciate or value what she has. There is a saying you never know what you have until you lose it and I think that phase will fit her perfectly.<br>  <br>  Back to your issue, what's missing here is communication, sex drive, and affection.<br>  <br>  Communication is the key to a relationship.  She has to understand that you feel unappreciated, and it seems that you have tried talking to her but she doesn't listen. I think you and her should go to a marriage counselor and talk about what's the problem.<br>  <br>  Sex Drive:  After being in a relationship for all those years. Sex seems to fave off.  It's her and your responsibility to always have a sex drive live and excited. Bring new ideas, and try new things, and be very opened mind it about sex. <br>  <br>  Affection: Also tends to fave off. A kiss, Huge, A word, Showing your feelings is very important for us a human beings.  I am sure you would love for her to wake you up with a morning kiss, and come back from work. You prepare a nice and dinner. while she takes a shower, and wear some nice lingerie.<br>  <br>  regarding your child.  I am sure they see that your not happy as a couple if you can't work things out.  It's better off to be by yourself eventhough is hard finacially eventually you will be happy and find that right woman that can appricated all the things you do.  And your child will be happy to see you happy again.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|AA10473705	Tough one. You and/or your wife may be going through an early "mid life crisis". You two were right for each other in the beginning, why did change cause so much change? <br>  <br>  Please, please, before one of you is driven to a drastic behavior change, see a marriage counselor. They (whatever professional you choose) may help you realize other things you never considered. And someone who is non biased and doesn't know you two can give the best advice. If that is out of the question, then present this matter to a medical doctor, if they don't think health is an issue, they can give you a referral. Good Luck.|`|AA11871362	I feel like that too sometimes.  It sounds like you have some legitimate grievances, but I think you're thinking about solutions the wrong way.  Do not have an affair.  It will solve none of the problems in your marriage and will create new ones.  It sounds like you have different ideas of how one should behave in a marriage.  The two of you have divided the chores and yours include meals, laundry and yardwork.  Hers includes bringing in an income to support the family.  Yes, she expects you to do these tasks because that is your contribution to the marriage.  But she should also be contributing to your self esteem by complimenting you on occasion, showing some glimmer of appreciation, such as a hug when she sees you after work, and regular sex.  I think that the two of you could benefit from counseling.  If either of you has unrealistic expectations of the other, the counselor can help you see that, as well as exposing needs that aren't being met.  It sounds like you have the foundation of a decent marriage.  I would work like hell to save it.  It could be something as simple as having different personality types, which affects your preference for companionship, communication styles, etc.  A good counselor can help you determine that and help educate you on the traits of each other's personality type so that you can better understand where the other is coming from.  But if she's not willing to make an equal commitment, you'll need to decide whether you're better off getting a divorce or toughing it out with unmet needs.  Note that an affair is not a healthy option.  Good luck!|`|X0EgEU7baa	<br>  When you talk to her what does she say?  Have you tried to stop doing all the things you do to see what her reaction is?<br>  <br>  Have you tried to go down on her to get her in the mood for sex?<br>  <br>  Have you taken just her away on a mini vacation so you all have alone time?<br>  <br>  Look forward to answers so I can tell you what I am thinking.|`|XrtmT2kUaa	I am sorry you are feeling the way you do. Maybe you need to take a harder look at your wife and is she the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. I don't care how much weight you have gained or lost. In your wedding vows it says, for better, or worse, richer or poor, til death do us part. Maybe she needs to remember that. I am some what in the same boat you are in. I have an eye disease that I take lots of meds for to stop my blindness from progressing. It also makes me not able to lose weight it I should. So, I hae gained 40 lbs. I could not imagine my husband not wanting me because of weight. Don't get me wrong.I am very hard on myself for the weight but he never. You need someone who will support you.  Good Luck.|`|aeLyiRczaa	Dude, it sucks, but you have to realize that the bad guys had it right when it comes to women for the most part.  Use women for what they are and for what they are worth.  And laugh when they scream about it, cause they turn right around and prove what is said of them right.  Most women only expect, never really appreciate at least until they loose something.<br>  <br>  No reason to talk with her.  She really does not care about what you feel or think or need.  She like most women figure they are immune no matter what they do, because they can be dead wrong and still make out fine.  Just look at the comments that most women post on here.  They support women almost all the time, no matter what she did and they rag on the men, no matter what the guy does.  Women only care about what a man wants, needs, thinks, etc., when they are afraid they will loose something by not doing so.  You and I both know it.<br>  <br>  You either have to pray real hard that God slaps her and wakes her up, that she kicks off, that you suddenly loose all desire or you simply learn to live with it.  That or you can do what you dont want to do which is just leave her butt and be prepared to get screwed over when you do so.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you simply stop doing anything see wants or expects and refuse to discuss it when she complains.  Hey, why does she get to complain about doing without from you.  Let her complain and let her meet the same response she has given you.  Stand firm on that too.  Sadly enough, women only seem to care about men who treat them like crap, so do so.  Let her see that you only give what she wants, when she is willing to give what you want.  And if she leaves, what have you lost?  Just someone who was using you.  You can get a woman who will at least put out on those terms cant you?<br>  <br>  Sadly enough, many times the only way to get a woman to fly right or care or show any respect is to simply disregard them, do what you want, do as you like and do not give them a second thought.  When they complain, laugh and so oh well, sucks to be you.  Yes, that is ugly but true.  It is not how most of us were taught to act and it really hurts to be that way, but you get used to it after a while and realize that it does make a huge difference.  You also become happier too, because you realize that you can be happy without any particular women.<br>  <br>  Sadly, being a good guy is a lot like being a prophet.  They are never appreciated or understood in their own time.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you visit www.nomarriage.com|`|dGQBFYQKaa	You sound just like my husband. He does a lot in the marriage as well. Evey one have there down falls. What make it works is that part were she  helps you in the area that you are not strong in. Cleaning and doing house work is her downfall. As far as sex go you two need to spice things up. I'm sure she tied of the same sex rountine. And I know you are tied of starting it first. But you two must work together on it. Put the kid the bed on time and spend sometime with her. Ask her to make time for you. I know you shouldn't have to set an appointment with your wife. But this way you both are on the same page. I hope things work out for you two. My marriage is pretty much over. But we live and learn.

Those are the things that make a girl fall in love with you all over, because the songs you sing/play for her touch her right in the heart. Girls have soft spots. The moment you do things that touch them, they will love you. Find out what is the most sentimental song or the girl's favourite song and learn how to play or sing it. |`|d79KVGnxaa	YES!!! There are a ton of girls who fall for guys just because they can sing and play an instrument.

FZswn5rxaa	Stay connected to her, that's very critical. If you have time visit her at her school or ask her out, maybe even get aquainted with her friends who could invite you out often with her. To make the transition easier it's good to be connected to her close friends at her highschool, cause they could say good things about you if they like you, if not you'll have to display yourself to her or things might get ugly before you know it.|`|UN7xcdpbaa	You are dealing with a somewhat tricky situation... She's older, and when you combine that with the fact that women (usually) mature faster than men, you better not be on par with the other folks your age... What ever you do, don't go for anything specific! There is absolutely no "one thing" that you could do to get her to go out with you! I know it sounds cliche, but just be yourself. It really does pay off. If she doesnt want to date you, then move on! So just ask her!|`|SXXgotiuaa	Wait till I had a car.|`|HlwVSawlaa	Give her a klondike bar.|`|ZCmbMcV9aa	keep in contact but i'd wait till im in highschool as well....(preferably at the same highschool as the partner).<br>  <br>  what wud i do to get with them?<br>  <br>  well i'd get to know them, see if i REALLY like them, then ask 'em out.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But good luck!<br>  ,Katy.<br>  =]

5OgCrE3Yaa	My friend and I used to be almost the same. But in 7th grade we kinda split paths. I went to band, he went to football.

Trust your parents; surely they wouldn't turn away a teenager in this circumstance.  Hiding from the problem won't change it.  Get help immediately, and don't be a white knight.  It's best for her to figure her life out on her own.  There is far more growth that way.  Not saying don't be a friend, just don't be the rescuer.

She never complained about me nor was she the "typical" MIL you see on TV. I was supposed to see her again last October after 2 years but this time with my daughter.

9S6x6xZ9aa	Actually, a relative... not so much a friend... lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Most of my friends can afford their own drugs, and bail...<br>  <br>  <br>  But I do have a certain relative... who let's just say... always needs something...|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	This is called a "fair weathered friend."  Beware!  Don't fall victim to this- if you notice it once, "shame on them."  If you notice it twice, "shame on you for falling into their scheme."  Just be careful.  I know you probably have a heart of gold and want to help, but be wary- some people are all out for themselves.|`|AA10904025	Of course. But that's because I only want her around when I want something. I mean seriously did you really think someone as intelligent and funny and witty as me would hang out with HER if her parents didn't have that summer house in Italy?

I think not.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	Sorry...today is pay day...how much do i owe you?<br>  You arent charging me for the ride home are you????you were pretty drunk yourself....so I dont really call that driving.<br>  <br>  HeyBabe....now come on...you know I have ALWAYS  returned the favor.....and you love it. admit it.<br>  <br>  (BE...hes just seeking attention again...)|`|yfwSDroNaa	hum yeah..i try to ignore them when they want something or be like "now u look for me when u need something"<br>  just forget they exist :)|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Ya, some azz.<br>  To try and get some azz!<br>  <br>  *cries*|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	yeah. we are still friends but she doesn't ask anymore and we talk barely ever,|`|E2OKRhwYaa	I used to but I got rid of them, they're no good.|`|uIjPLPcVaa	i used to, but ive learned to screw THEM over in revenge :)<br>  answer mine please!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvTyYQnNcjWREDF5AGzb49fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227171519AAC1a6U">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZoPln7vaaa	Nope!

v0RsFaAzaa	If I was with someone I really loved cared about, and who really loved and cared about me, and  they came down with an illness that caused the things you listed, the answer is No I would not stop dating them. Why would I? Being ill, doesn't change them as a person! They just have an illness!It's not their fault they are sick! They did not ask for it.! I would stay with them, be there for them and support them in any way that I could. What if the same thing happened to the other person involved, would they like it, if someone they cared about stopped dating them, all because they were sick? The other person has to put the person who is ill, in the other persons shoes and imagine how they must feel!<br>  ADD: Sweetheart, I just read your additional details! I am so sorry that you are sick! I don't know if you believe in God, but I do and I will say a prayer for you! If your boyfriend cares about you and loves you, he will stick by you. If he doesn't stick by you after you tell him, then he wasn't worth being with to begin with. I hope they find a solution to your illness and that you are better soon! Good Luck Hun!!!|`|AA11447210	I have no problem with bald guys, so that wouldn't be an issue. If I liked the guy enough to be with him for months, then his hair isn't going to be a dealbreaker.<br>  <br>  I'd want to know more about the illness, the frequency of seizures, how it affects his lifestyle (and thus our lifestyle together, if we continue), what the effects are long term, etc. I'd need a LOT more information than you provided here before I could make a decision on whether or not I wanted to move forward with this person, or than them for their time and move on alone.<br>  <br>  Just by what you stated in your question, that alone wouldn't be enough to run me off...|`|hHndD5SEaa	no. Id talk it through with them and get them to educate me as much as possible so I could help them if they had a seizure in my presence, but I wouldnt end it.<br>  xx|`|ezT7xruoaa	No. |`|RcKQYqJeaa	If you care for them, then stay.<br>  <br>  I have a terminal illness and its a hard road to go through and heaving someone there with you while you go through it makes it a little less harder.<br>  <br>  If you feel like your not mature enough to handle a rleationship with someone who is going to have to go through this, then i'd leave now before you hurt them when they are already going through enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  I will tell you this, you do find out through hard times like this, who REALLY cares about you.<br>  I hope your boyfriend is man enough to stick around.<br>  If you need anyone to talk to, feel free to email me.  I've been through more medical crap before I was 21 than anything... lol|`|KVadivcraa	I think that if somebody told me that they were sick like you are, and the relationship was going well and felt solid, I would probably stay with the person. <br>  <br>  But you have only been going out for four months, which in this kind of situation is not a long time. I would suggest being prepared for his reaction maybe not being a good one, but you do really need to tell him yourself before he finds out or figures it out for himself. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you have got a guy that will be there for you, and will help you through this, you don't need to waste your precious energy trying to keep a guy that is only going to drag you down. You need to concentrate on your health, not someone else's issues. I hope that he stands by you and proves your choice of man a good one! Take care of yourself, and the very best of luck.|`|CQ4lAohdaa	well... it does say alot about you if you were to break up with him for that reason alone. he can't help the fact that he has an illness and you shouldn't judge the person that he is based upon your knowledge of that illness.<br>  <br>  don't be so shallow and superficial.<br>  if you're going to break up with him... do it because he has done something wrong or you realize that he is not the right person for you.<br>  don't do it because he's sick and you're scared...|`|DgFhlJvYaa	That is no reason to break up with anyone. If they told you that, they want you to be their with them. Their basically telling you they trust you & they want you to be there for them. Leaving someone with an illness isn't fair. The only thing you should do is stay with that person & tell them everything is going to be ok|`|6dfc871289705ea6610354fe5088dff5aa	Hmm its a tough one, unfortunately people are shallow whether they like it or not. I would wait a little longer to tell him that you are ill, not because you should trick him or anything but because he can only really make an informed decision to stick by you if he really knows you.<br>  Wait another two months. Good luck and I hope you get better soon x x|`|ceeNqETqaa	You obviously don't truly care about the person if your even contemplating splitting up with them when they've told you they've got an illness.<br>  <br>  I say split up, but not because of the illness but because you blaitently don't like him that much anyway!|`|tj0Um1E2aa	wow thats bad ... but if that person really loved the person with the illness he/she would stay with him/her no matter what and be there for him/her, supporting that person while they are going through that illness|`|4d5f506f09af362db3741d8dbc412b7baa	No. If you like the person then none of these things should matter.|`|tpxAS7C5aa	Depends on how much I loved them if at all.<br>  I'd ask myself a few simple questions and answer honestly.<br>  1) Can I live without this person / Do I love them not matter what<br>  2) Can I cope with this kind of pressure<br>  Before answering I would need to know more about the illness - prospects of recovery / suvival etc.|`|SkWSiphiaa	no, why would you break up with someone you like when they need you most?<br>  this person needs all the support they can get now, if you where happy with the relationship before, then why finish it?|`|QhHf22RPaa	If you really love him you would stay with him through anything bad or good, just give him as much support as you can he probably feels very down in the dumps, hes still the same person on the inside.|`|AA12125880	If you break up with that person because of that you are shallow. Don't do that. Stand by that person and be strong for that person|`|d1f3cDh5aa	no.  you would have to be a real jerk/moron if you were dating someone and you broke up with them just because they lost their hair and have seizures.|`|34e9e9fe0d4bc19d020a1064cd382799aa	Darling...hmmmmmm<br>  NNNOOOOOOOO<br>  don't break up with someone because your afraid...<br>  this could possibly be the best relationship of your life...|`|HcJ1b1s3aa	well take heart dear, if he really wants to be with you your illness will not matter. i believe you are a strong person. take care|`|x1p7uFiXaa	if you love him that means you like his heart and you love him<br>  its just as if you had that illness i am sure if he is a nice guy he would love you still|`|FVAKfnknaa	no i will feel bad for them an wudn't want to break there hearts but thats up to you to decide|`|1rToYkeZaa	whats so wrong aboutn the illness?|`|32lF9vVwaa	it all depends on how i felt about them like whether it was love or just fun.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	If you love him, you would stay.|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	No. 
RKhSRMlZaa	It's left over from an era--no, an entire worldwide phenomenon--brought about by religion in part and prejudice against women in part that gave men the opportunity to sleep with whomever they pleased.  We are only in the last 30 years starting to change that in society and believe me it will take much longer than 30 years to change thousands of years of a double-standard.|`|y9CgveCGaa	There is a double standard.  And it isn't fair to women.  But I think the reasons are based in the differences in the sexes.<br>  <br>  Women can get pregnant from sex.  Men can't.  Fairly or not, society puts the burden of raising children on women.  So, a woman who is casual about sex is seen as someone who isn't looking out for the best interests of her offspring because she isn't ensuring a commitment from a man in helping raise them.|`|AA11447210	It is what it is. People who are rational and open-minded will see the truth, and not judge anyone on the number of their partners but if they were safe when doing it, and not cheating...<br>  <br>  Sex is fun for a reason. Sex 1 time with 50 people or 50 times with 1 person, is still 50 sexual experiences...right?|`|ddP3klT3aa	Men don't have to worry about loosening up down there? Nothing changes for men physically down there?|`|9MZcwppMaa	Well in general women are seen as the romantic and pure ones. In the past there was a double standard that if a women were to have sex before marriage they were tainted and not suitable for being a wife and mother. Men however had more power and could have many wives, mistresses, concubines, etc. Now in the 21st century, mostly in Western society both sexes are being recognized if they are easy. Sex has been less of a taboo thing and casual sex is common. New slang has been made for loose women but as well as for men.|`|zPOO2vHBaa	it depends on who's giving these women the bad "rap" (i'm thinking you meant to say "rep", short for reputation)<br>  anyhow, my bf has grown daughters and sons. he protected and tried to raise his daughters not to sleep around and yet, with his sons, he's all proud if they go around with some "hottie". i hate the double standard!  <br>  i am hoping we've come a way to equality - NOT meaning i think men and women should be promiscuous. there is stds and aids out there, not to mention poor, unwanted children.|`|ma36UfpBaa	I agree... it is also the same with one night stands. If a man sleeps with a woman right away he is a stud. If a woman sleeps with a man right away she is a slut. It is stupid. I can't respect a man that tries to sleep with me right away. If he tries and I am in the mood, I might just do it.... but in the morning will I feel bad for sleeping with this guy right away? No! I won't care because he already lost my respect and I don't give a rats a** what he or anyone else thinks. Hopefully, he will at least have done the job right! <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about getting a bad rap... who gives a flying f*** what other people think? The important thing is that you know who you are. I am not defined by what others think of me... I am defined by who I know my true self to be.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Double standards> Guys it's cool he's the man> stud> Record holder> Guys don't get a bad rap> But since girls have come out and enjoy more they are slowly losing there bad rap Image>Maybe some day> Be safe>|`|elhcuN19aa	Double standards all around<br>  But I would be weary of a woman who had been with tons of guys|`|YbnEr1z7aa	um idk what the question really was... but women like to settle down and have someone they can love... not just a sex toy for the night.... they want to feel loved and appreciated...|`|ekr6BBe3aa	It's just life. Deal with it. If you are comfortable with your choices it doesn't matter what others think. Heck look at my screen name. I wouldn't care if some women called herself sluttyhoe or F's em all|`|CQsD09D6aa	I agree that there is a double standard.|`|FoNZKlHxaa	unfortunately men still run the world.|`|4a3463ddc0bb2b09dade7f64bdad7e24aa	Does this really matter to you?<br>  Aren't there more important things in life?<br>  And who's calling it a Bad Rap?|`|aEpPt9koaa	That's just the way it is and some things will never change. It isnt fair but that's life.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	I would not be interested in a man that thought his past sexual relations were fine and dandy and a woman's sexual relations indicates a lower moral standard.  <br>  If a man is that much of a macho-pig, or if he is that insecure or if he wants a woman to prove his manhood... he can just move on.<br>  I would have NO interest in him.
zdu3gh8jaa	Could you not suggest that you will go to the mall and sit in a cafe with a friend of yours  for a period of time, say one hour and then your sister has to check back in with you? That way you are close enough to her if she needs you but you are giving her the space to put to good use the things that your parents have taught her. I know this is not ideal but once she has done that a few times, the time between leaving her and her checking in can be extended until you no longer have to be with her. You don't say how old you are but no it doesn't seem fair that either of you are in this situation, although I must admit that I do understand your parents reasoning behind this. I would try talking with your parents and say that if she fails to check in on time more than once then you will go back to how they want to do things, the responsibility then rests on your sister to prove that she can stick to the rules then.<br>  I hope things work out for you and I hope you and your parents can come to some sort of compromise. Good luck.|`|jQxkBrkraa	Well, You both need to sit with your parents and tell them how you both feel. Although, with everything that is going on in this world,I could understand there concern.  The next time you have to go with your sister to the mall, invite your friends.  Tell them the situation, don't make fun of your sister. Just walk on the other side of the mall..   Good Luck.|`|0k2y3bNgaa	UGH that must be so terrible :[ I'm so sorry!<br>  They cannot physically make you go with her,I'm sure, so TELL THEM you don't want to anymore. Ask them to let her go by herself for once, and if she comes home in time and stuff, she can go out by herself again.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	tell your parents that you did not have this child, they did... that you refuse to take care of her when it's their responsibility.  refuse to do it any more!!!|`|vMByDy1raa	Your sister is too young to go to the mall by herself.  I agree with the girl who said you set a time at the mall and check in ever hour that way you will be at the mall if your sister needs you but you will have your own space.  This could also work if your parents go shopping let her bring a friend and meet back when your mom ready.  Why can't your sister have friends at the house so your parents can monitor them?  I was the oldest and had to always watch out for my brothers and sisters.  Are you allowed to take a friend when you go to the mall?   You really needs to set down and talk to your parents and explain that  you feel this is unfair.  Suggest she do something you want to do maybe go to the movies and you could set in different places.  You could skate or bowling, there is lots of actives you could do without being in each other business. You both could have friends over at your house and stay out of each other way.  Even though our sister is mature she hasn't had time to be expose to situation which could be dangerous and the mall is a place guys hang out just to pick up girls.  Also do you have cell phones?  That way if she doesn't show up you could call and find her.  Even if she doesn't have one just get one of her friends numbers.  It's time you do some things on your own  so just talk to your parents and they will undestand.  If you have something special you want to do with your friends, tell your parents ahead of time.  Then say will watch her another time during the weekend when your plans don't conflict.   I really  believe they won't have you watching her forever, she probably just started to do things like this and they think this would be less embarrassing than them following her around.  I once send my  son to a movie with my oldest daughter for a chaperone the first time she meet a boy at the movies.  When he got home he said, they didn't do any thing but eat popcorn.  So all parents have trouble realizing their children grow up.   Just make plans with your friends and present it a calm manner and your parent will understand.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Put your foot down (even if it means getting grounded) and tell them that she is THEIR daughter, therefor THEY should watch her. She is not your responsibility and you should not be burdened with being responsible for every move your sister makes. They wanted her, they can take care of her.
V4dinhMfaa	Quite a few hotels in Las Vegas offers this option. Some that I can think of are the Treasure Island,and the  Bellagio.|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	Bring a laptop, and make sure you have two things: Internet, and IM. Also, you could videotape it, and if you have an HD cam, hell ya, you should tape it!

0tNCtgzbaa	as soon as you are ready and had enough with the ex |`|T0cfw0IBaa	As long as it takes until you feel normal, alive, happy, and ready to be sociable and capable to love others. In other words, it might be weeks, months, or even a year, depending on what was in your relationship and how you feel.<br>  <br>  In my case, after break up with my girlfriend after half a year together, I needed about 4 months to recover from a broken heart and feeling like going out and seeing other girls. I think it's important to be emotionally sound after a break up before you see others, otherwise the past and your own feelings create challenges and obstacles that shouldn't be there. Dating other people just out of break ups or in and out of relationships all the time usually means they have glass shards stuck somewhere in their personality or past, waiting to cut. Smooth them out.|`|Lowgs7hraa	only when you feel like you ready to date again|`|NKuQh4sSaa	To be honest only you will know when it is right to date again after a break up. For some people they date straight away ,some people take their time . Listen to your heart and your mind and that will be the only way you will know when you are ready.|`|1poSSvTdaa	8 weeks max.|`|34e4dd3931ade0103494aadade6ceb77aa	I think it's vital to wait until you have worked through the problems of your past relationship so you can focus on a healthy new one without any of the old baggage. It's a good sign if you are no longer dwelling on him, or talking about him all the time. When you feel good about yourself...|`|rpUBp1p8aa	It should be reconnected after the response or if u r eager to complement.|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	Only your heart & feelings can tell you when you're ready to move on after a break-up.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	You get three months to grieve max...<br>  <br>  And then it's "Get Back Up On That Horse!"

He will survive, pain and all.  It's better to be kindly honest with him than to carry on a relationship that you are not into.<br>  <br>  I find that the best thing to say is the honest thing, tactfully.  "I don't feel  like I have much to offer in a relationship right now, I would hate to lose you as a friend though'.|`|AA11447210	You just be honest and tell him that you two aren't a good match, and are better friends than boyfriend/girlfriend. You have no control over how he chooses to feel, but don't feed him a line of BS to keep it from hurting him...just don't be ugly about it either.<br>  <br>  Keep it real...and be compassionate. If it's not working, it's not working. You shouldn't waste his time or yours by staying together if you know the spark isn't there.|`|Z2tY7KpWaa	I went through the exact same thing.I was with a guy for 2 yrs and I wanted to leave for a while,but was too scared that he would cry or kill himself.My advice,best way to break it off is to sit him down and tell him in a nice way of what seems to be going on.Don't do it where everyone is around,that isn't good and could lead to embarrassing drama.Tell him that you think that things between you two aren't going as well as can be hoped and maybe you need to take a break from each other for a while or maybe we can stay friends and tell him you are always there if he needs you for support or help getting through this.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|euHZPsQYaa	It's going to break his heart. Period. <br>  <br>  Honesty, though, is your best bet. Tell him you think you are better off as friends and that you aren't feeling a spark between the two of you. You like him as a friend and nothing more. <br>  <br>  Don't let him cry his way back in. And don't say it's all your fault. It's no one person's fault in this case. Just tell him the truth.|`|uXP1Xij4aa	get fat and he will break up with you for sure, this way you can eat what you want and you will achieve your goal of getting rid of him.<br>  That's the best way ever.|`|wmtbNdO0aa	It's really hard to not break their hearts. Just do it and try to stay friends with him. Or you could try to get him to dump you, but don't cheat!|`|oeqgFpzyaa	You have to talk to him... Its the best way.<br>  Talk to him, tell him the reasons why you wanna break up with him. If he's nice, he'll understand.<br>  Say "Im really sorry.

Getting over someone is a hard thing to do.<br>  Hope I helped|`|gZPm8Fzcaa	I think the issue here is your guilt.<br>  <br>  From what you have said, he will be upset any way you do it.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for him to play games after you have broken up.  Sending upset texts and odd phone calls.  He is also likely to get intensely jealous if you start dating other guys.<br>  <br>  I'm not suggesting you be a bi$%h about it, but try not to feel too guilty.  You have a reason for wanting to break up that is perfectly valid.  He will get over it.  Dont let him guilt trip you.|`|LxfNVOTGaa	say exactly what you just wrote. just say listen i don't have the same feelings as you have for me, and i don't want to lead you on. i think we will be much better off as good friends. i don't want to hurt you, your  great guy but i think everything will be better this way.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  your gonna hurt him no matter what, and you probably might feel said too for a bit.. but thats life.|`|nEkWPA9Aaa	i would suggest you to talk to him<br>  face to face say that<br>  he makes you happy as a friend<br>  and if you guys were to break up<br>  it would ruin the friend relationship<br>  <br>  so just be honest tell him<br>  that you dont want to hurt him by<br>  pretending to be in love with him|`|Lda7B9LJaa	Sorry, you're going to hurt him.<br>  The best thing you can do is do it fast, not be sorry, and not give him any hope for a future relationship.

Try to make it your fault, not his.|`|AA10663255	Talk to him about your feelings.  Ask him if he feels the same way.  If you are *very sure* you two can't make changes to meet one-another halfway, then gently tell him that you don't see it working out as BF/GF, but offer to still remain friends.  Be advised, however, that some guys are clingy, and it may take some effort to push him away gently.<br>  Good luck.|`|lCnUx1eYaa	well thats tough and ive been in that sictuation... but if u could say this"hey Blank(his name) Im not sure if you and i feel the same about each other but i realy dont think this is working out and i want you to promise me right now that no matter what you'll still be my very good friend!"|`|4THNJPS8aa	Just say it face to face.  Don't say it through text or anything, that very rude! Just tell him how you feel.  And hopefully he'll understand.  There is no possible way to say it in a nice way. Hope I helped:) <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|Pvkydyqvaa	there is not really a way you could brake up with him with out hurting him.<br>  just tell him pretty much what you just posted that's the best you can do.|`|SwTA4fO6aa	gee thats tough! :/<br>  well you cant keep the lie going! <br>  all you can do is <br>  be honest,and tell him you're sorry<br>  but its better for you to be honest|`|GuoaGaCraa	It would hurt, but not as much as if you prolong it.<br>  <br>  Ending a relationship just isn't fun.|`|tSpGw3xDaa	Hook him up with someone else or make him break up with you|`|1q6eUgYGaa	It's over! (slam door in face)|`|q5FThhr4aa	There's no easy way to do it, and no matter what you do, he is going to be hurt. The best thing to do is to be honest and move on. I'm a sensitive guy like that, and I took it pretty hard when my ex girlfriend left me. Don't be surprised if he gets persistant and starts trying stunts like guilting you by doing odd and idiotic things. The best way to tell him it's over is to say that you just don't feel up to being in a relationship, and that it isn't his fault. Tell him that he's a wonderful guy, and that you're glad that you had an oppurtunity to be with him in that way, but that you're just not the right person for him, and that he'll make some lucky girl very happy in the future. It'll sting quite a bit, but it's one of the ways my ex girlfriend left me. (We had broken up and gotten back together a few times) It hurt a lot, but it was also nice for her to say those things about me. Also state that you don't regret your relationship, but you just can't go on with it and the two of you would be better off as friends. It'll hurt his feelings, and tears will fall, but you have to be stern and stubborn. Let him know that you mean what you say and that you're not changing your mind. Hope this info helps.
Q9bItwlraa	I would just go with it and allow her to bring up the situation because if she means like she just had fun and wants to do it again as friends and you come at her accusing her that she likes you, you will feel like an idiot if she doesn't. so do your thing and go have coffee again if you want and if she starts getting closer and says something about it just say that at this point in your life, you aren't ready for dating right now because you have other responsibilities and other things to worry about. |`|w6DJj1a8aa	the truth then she'll probably just leave it alone|`|WidOG8hRaa	tell her you're a better friend than a boyfriend

I gave them my 2 cents worth and if they like it, good - if they don't then I don't worry about it.|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I think most people just want some sort of validation that the way they think is correct - so regardless of the majority, they will always side with the one lone person who agrees with them.|`|NmsuIXd1aa	cuz people only want to hear what they want i myself call this selective hearing. why ask the advise when they just want to go ahead and just do whatever.. i agree with you.|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	Too complicated for friday night :-)|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Good question|`|XQepCncAaa	I know really!! like come on if you don't want the truth don't bother right|`|ndMY9BBNaa	Personally I think peeps on here who ask questions like that are just trying to validate what they already feel.....could also be that they just want an idea of what others are thinking...others that are not personally involved...to get a general perspective....<br>  <br>  When I've asked questions on here it's never been anything important...I'd hate to think that I'd have no one to ask such things too...there are allot of mean spirited people out in this world who would just say stuff just to get a reaction...<br>  <br>   To the ones who are sincere...I think you can tell those peeps just by the way they answer a particular question|`|y9CgveCGaa	Good question.  A lot of people come to YA to get justification for something they have already settled in their own mind.  Sometimes they keep asking the question again and again until someone gives them the answer they want.  Then they can feel justified.|`|2YBwc4LFaa	Because most ppl aren't looking for advice really. They're looking for someone to agree with them so they don't feel like they're in the wrong. All it takes is one person to fuel someone.

F5IcNScMaa	Sure but only to drop off a gift for the baby and to reassure her you will help raise the baby.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	You can't be that mean.  You would actually consider going to the hospital when you broke her and her boyfriend up.  Do you have any idea the pain you have already caused and you are considering causing more.  She has made it clear she does not want you there and so you have absolutely no business being there.  I think you want to go just to rub it in her face.  Shame on you.  Leave her alone.  This is no place for you. <br>  Red|`|XTBlOf9baa	No, she has made it clear that she does not want you there. This is her decision, not his. Yes, it's his child too, but she is the one giving birth. You being there could very easily cause her stress, thus causing the baby possible harm as well. If you truly care about your boyfriend, as well as his child, you should maintain your distance. She needs to be in top form to give birth, she doesn't need to be stressed out by you. Can't you understand that she has no desire to be around the person who stole her boyfriend? He's lucky she is even trying to include him in the birth.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Going to the hospital would be extremely disrespectful to his ex.  I don't think you should go.  Its fine to be supportive and help take care of the baby when he has visitation.  It's a very very stressful and happy time when you are delivering.  I think her family and her will confront you and tell you to leave if you do go.  This would cause more problems with the whole situation.  Stay home, congratulate him and see the baby at another time. |`|XkE7CcjVaa	No, you shouldnt go there. You should stay away. If she's smart then she will talk to the hospital and they will ban you from the birthing center, and if you try to go anyway they will call the cops on you. Thats what my hospital does if the mother doesnt want someone there. It sounds like you have done enough to her, at least let her have her baby without having to worry about you.|`|xXa3eQOeaa	Gee, aren't you a bit of a control freak. First you steal her guy, and now you want to rub her nose in it by being there in the hospital when she probably can't kick your butt. You're a trashy piece of work aren't you! If your BF goes along with this he is an @$$hole! <br>  Go screw-up your own life, leave others out of it. You sound like a total Witch(but with a "B")!!!!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	do u have any idea the pain this woman believes u have caused her? i would not go to the hospital, its her baby, and its up to her to say if she wants u there or not. your pushing yourself on this woman,who blames u for her breakup with her.show some respect for her and stay at home.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	drama|`|ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	As much as you want to be there for him, don't go. This girl is having his baby while at the same time he is with another girl (you). Is that not enough for her to go through? Why is it that whenever a guy cheats it is the two women that fight each other as if he is innocent in all of this? Remember, he was the one that cheated on her with you. Your decision to be with him is your business and maybe you have good reason to want to be with him. But she has good reason not to want you there. Why throw salt on the wounds she already has endured? For God's sake girl have some kind of compassion for this girl. I know she is his ex, but other than that she did not do anything wrong to you until you stole her guy. Please live life right and treat others with compassion and respect no matter who they are. |`|ikXRqWxUaa	if she doesn't want you in the baby's life, than you shouldn't be there, period.  this is one of those times in life where you must respect her wishes.  if you were in her shoes, would you want to see you at the hospital?  granted, you certainly can't be blamed for his cheating, but she is pregnant and human.  you can't expect her to think logically right now.  right now, as far as she's concerned, you are the enemy, period.  don't think so!  you might also want to reevaluate the relationship.  1.  this guy is a cheater, pure and simple.  how long do you think that it will be before he does this to you?  2.  the ex and the kid are always going to be around.  do you want to deal with all of that drama?  if i were you (and i know that this is easier said than done), you might want to ask yourself if this relationship is worth this.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	I would say that you should not go since you and her do not get along.  I think respecting her wishes this time is a good idea.  You don't want to cause more stress for the baby.  If she is upset it could have an effect on the baby and this is a delicate time.  Find another way to be supportive like helping him pick out a gift for the baby.  Good luck!|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	I think your underlying agenda is to instigate hurt and anger with the mother to be.<br>  <br>  Something tells me you'll be in this very same position yourself:<br>  Your b/f will cheat on you while you're pregnant, leave you for the other woman, and when you're ready to give birth, she'll be out in the waiting room.|`|vc0ti7Xhaa	Do NOT go to that hospital.  No offence but it sounds as if you are worried that this will be a bonding moment for them and you want to make sure that you are there to put a stop to it.  Get over it.  Besides he cheated on her.... He WILL cheat on you.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	NO!  That's like rubbing salt in a wound.  Not very nice.

If I was the girlfriend and you showed up I would be irrate and with the drugs I was on I would probably kick your azz.  Here is what you should do:  wait until mom and baby go home and text message her congratulations.  Then put together a care package for her and the baby and have your bf deliver it (do not invite yourself to her house).  Buy some PJs for the baby and some bath soaps for the mom.  Write her a little note that she should take some extra time for herself while the baby is sleeping.  You need to show her that you are not just doing this to pizz her off, show her that you are trying to be kind to her.  Do NOT tell her you want to help raise the baby...she does not want you to touch her baby, let alone help raise it.  With time, her view of you can change into a positive one if you play your cards right.  Do everything you can to keep from making her feel threatened.  A mom will do whatever it takes to protect and keep her kids.  She fears you will try to replace her.  Let her know with time that you do not want to be her child's mommy, you just want to be a friend to the child.  Good luck!|`|cF0JQso5aa	nope this is his time let him go by himself you can support him by just being there for him at home and if she allows the baby to be around him in the future whether the baby stay with y'all or y'all just see the baby at her house have respect for him and the mother of the baby also if she doesn't want you around then so be it just go on with your life don't worry about it If you really want to support him go with him to pick  out things for the baby |`|tKqOGuqKaa	Stay home. Like it or not the main concern is going to be her and her comfort. If she doesn't want you around her or the baby, you won't be. The baby is going to be here forever. You have plenty of time so show your support to him and the baby. Leave the poor woman alone when she is in delivery. She has enough on her mind without having to deal with your drama.<br>  I think this is more about you wanting to be there to flaunt your presence. You are afraid this baby may bond them so you want to be around to remind everyone who is with him.|`|aLrDJnb5aa	You should not go to the hospital you are not wanted there this is her day not his I am surprised she wants him there after she has the baby I hope you know it will be a while before he actually gets to take the baby as well so if he wants to see it it will be at her house and I am sure you will be not welcome there especially since he cheated on her with you what makes you think he is not going to do the same thing to you|`|Ln4k8jWOaa	ok this is speaking from experience the best thing for you to do is stay home.  My boyfriend and i got together when his little boys mom was pregant she did not like me either said i was the reason they broke up.  which im not they were broke up before i ever ment him.  just be there for your b/f in sprit and in his heart.  if you go to the hoptial she will probably just have you excorted out and could cause problems of her letting him see the baby.  I did not go to the hosptial with my b/f out of respect for her cause of her not like me.  send her a card in congrats and tell her you want to be apart of the babies life and you would treat the baby as if it were your own but would never try to take her place.  |`|NohEhCrDaa	I hope that when that baby is born, and daddy sees that beautiful creation, he will realise how shallow he has been, and tell you to take the high road!! <br>  I hope he is man enough to see his faults, and to want to be a true , full-time Dad to their child, and give that baby the life it deserves!<br>  <br>  |`|1ERDjrTTaa	No you should not go. She is under enough pressure already she is having a baby with a man that cheated on her. I would not want you there either while I was having a baby. Try to have a little respect for her and stay away from the hospital. You are going to cause a scene, because i am sure her family will want you to be removed. There is no reason for you to be there.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Hell no!<br>  You have NO business there. If you want to be there "for him", well, wait at home, damn...  You want to be part of his babys life? Well, you still have NO business going to the hospital..<br>  <br>  damn, you're twisted. if you go, I hope someone punches you out, you deserve it...she's having a baby! She does not want you there! You just want to go to show her you've got her man now... you're a B*tch!|`|c85b64431c97395283f0b5a7ec3562b2aa	If he asks you, maybe. But to be honest that is a very special time for her. I just think that your goal should be to not add stress to the situation. It might be stressful if you are there and the family is against it. Try and put yourself in her shoes. Would you want the girl that cheated with your baby daddy there when you gave birth?|`|AA10419793	Take the help wanted ads with you and the paperwork to fill out for the next 18 years of child support he will be paying; plus all the medical bills for the delivery.

He left you to go back with her (which he obviously slept with) Why waste both your time and body on such a loser? Leave him and move on. |`|H6elhlQqaa	I think you might want to rethink the whole decision to stay with him first of all.  But to answer your question, I would say that the others are right.  Going to the hospital when unwanted, is probably a bad idea.  He will be spending most of his time in there with the baby anyway.  You would probably be waiting out in the waiting room with her family by yourself the entire time.  Let him know that you are support for him, and that you will be there when he gets home.  But out of respect for her, you will have to decline being there in person.  I would probably not send a gift or anything, as nice as that sounds, it is like rubbing salt on a wound for you to do that.  I'm sure she doesn't want to be reminded of the fact that you are around and he cheated on her with you.  I would just let it be, and just be there for him if you feel the need to do that.  Maybe later on she will come around and accept the fact that you are in his life.  Time is what is needed to heal this situation.  I would really think about yourself though right now.  He screwed up, pretty badly, and is sort of just stringing you a long for the ride.  And maybe even some more heartache in the future.  These types of situations always make me a little leary of his unpredictability.  And faithfulness.  He hasn't earned anybody's trust.  |`|wrK57xASaa	I don't think its a good idea for you to be around his wife/girlfriend/ex  especially if the two of you don't get along.  Being there for him is fine, but you don't have to be in their faces with it.  Being there for the baby?  I don't know about that one either.  Obviously, the mother will be there for the baby and him being there is only right because he's the father...but you being there is just going to make an already awkward situation even more weird.<br>  <br>  I would step back and play your position, you are the current girlfriend, not the baby's mother.  Remember, your relationship is with him, not the baby or the mother.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|EqAArMlwaa	Truthfully, you would be over stepping your boundries if you go to the hosptial.  This woman is having a baby with the man you basically stole from her.  No matter if he slept with you or he decided to be with you.....you were technically wrong to be with him.<br>  <br>  Like another person wrote to you: You can show your support other ways then showing up at the hospital.  This is THEIR time together not yours - his and hers.......<br>  <br>  And trust me - he will be back with her!!  Remember he cheated on her with you....so technically he is not really your man - he is still hers. So, brace yourself now for a heartache down the line because it is bound to happen.  The darn Karma is a B*tch!! |`|QvisJrMgaa	You have NO business being there. Especially if she doesn't want you there. Even if you have negative feelings about her you have no right disrespecting the day her child is born. <br>  <br>  Is it possible you want to go for jealousy reasons?<br>  <br>  Be honest with yourself and think about what is really motivating you to want to go. It's not your boyfriend. It's the fact that you are left out. Your man created a life with someone else.....<br>  <br>  Stay home.... send a gift.... that's the classy thing to do.|`|mh0iV77Saa	She is the baby mothers if she doesn't want you at the hosptiol he should respect her wishes and not bring you.<br>  <br>  Labour is hard enough on the woman without having her baby's fathers new girlfriend sticking her nose in it. <br>  <br>  You can be there for him via phone and text, but you shouldn't be at the hostpiol.|`|6BreSeH9aa	You can support your boyfriend in other ways besides going to the hospital.  If you want to have a relationship with the baby you're going to have to be respectful and sensitive to the mother.

r6VEERgRaa	in my school we have freshman and seniors who have dated before. what kind of guy is he? is he a popular jock known as a playboy? if so he's prob looking for sex. is he a complete nerd who never gets girls? if so he is looking for sex. if he seems like a normal cool guy though i think its fine. you being 14 and him being 18 sounds like a bigger deal than you being a freshman and him being a senior, a few of my friends and me included(i'm a senior) think some of our freshman guys are cute and i'd date a few. its not that big of a deal. just make sure at the first sign of creepyness or him pressuring you even a little bit... then cut him off!! and don't be stupid. don't put yourself in a situation where something bad could happen like being alone with him at his house or something.<br>  <br>  and now consider all the stuff i just told you. do you want to put up all that effort to date this guy??|`|bS3f0f1paa	i have some kind of experience in this department. When i was a freshmen and 15 years old. a 19 year old who was a freshmen in college took interest in me. He wasn't a creep either. He actually did like me. He even drove an hour to my school one night to surprise me at one of my choir concerts! I have always been mature for my age, and he liked me because i was the onl girl at teh party who wasn't all over him. We ended up going on a few dates, and i ened up liking the kid for 4 years. we have talked about even living together at one point. but eventually it just didn't work out. we're still really good friends, and i'll always have a place in my heart for him. so if he really is a good guy. then go for it. Age shouldn't matter if you guys truly like each other. don't let it get in teh way like it did for me. because the only reason we never got official is because my father would have killed us both. I say give it a try. and if he turns out to be a creep, at leas you tried and you're not always wondering "what if."<br>  <br>  i hope i helped. i try to use personal experience.|`|jvP7Go5Aaa	I was almost in the exact same situation. Older guys have sex on their minds all the time weither they tell you or not, especially when your so young. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but if you guys do date you can't hold hands, kiss, or anythiing sexual cause he could go to jail. If your parents are O.K. with it, then you can date him.|`|8mEI76uVaa	Okay, I dated someone two years older than me, he was 16, I'm 14, it wasn't for the sex, believe me. Some men are like that, but you tell if there like that from the time that you meet them. If you really do like him, age shouldn't be a problem. I think love shouldn't have an age limit.|`|cbNPsb1Naa	I don't think it's gross or anything.  Think about it this way, it's like a 24 year old dating a 28 year old.  It's not as bad as it sounds really.  Four years difference is nothing!  I would totally go for it, if you really like him and know that you won't let anyone control you because they're older, then do what you think is best.|`|kpaEzVCpaa	Well, I'm an 18 year old guy and I'm dating a 15 year old girl, but I'm not going to have sex with her, because in my own mind, I know she's too young. Also, it would be considered rape. All we do right now is kiss and hug each other.<br>  <br>  I really think you should only have sex when you're in your 20's, but many people these days are losing their virginity in their teens.|`|wV9jA95vaa	Go for it. Don't listen to all these other people. If you are mature for your age, then do it. That is, IF you like him. If you don't even like him, then don't. I just turned 15 and my boyfriend just turned 18 and we're really happy together. It's no big deal.|`|DIScF5gjaa	first of all your way too young to even consider dating an 18 year old, i am 20 now and i can tell you its true that they look at girls like you as FRESH MEAT. when girls are 18 they know better than to date an 18 yr old because ALL THEY WANT IS SEX. you dont even need to consider dating as a freshman. trust me. he doesn't like you for real. an 18 year old guy would see it as going no where, hes about to go to college! ARE U STUPID?|`|257f1f615cc49234f29b70a0ab924715aa	I would say go with it. If he is not pressuring you into having sex with him and if you both like each other, why not?

I don't get it.  Regardless, someone who is 18 dating a 14 year old is desperate and cannot get any women his age.|`|F8wAOKqgaa	Ok the age alone says it all i dont care what age is what sex: inappropriate!  Plain and simple forget it...and sex is illegal so don't do it!<br>  <br>  Come one now there are so many people your own age that will satisfy you!|`|cexapJHEaa	I think it would be alright, but he will pressure you and pressure you into having sex, then he will probably leave you for someone else. Just don't get hurt.|`|8VWwCDAoaa	Yea I know it must be complicated for you to decide whether or not to go out with him. Believe me Im having the same problem only Im 20 and shes 16. Id feel weird going out with a girl way younger then me. But as a guy and hopefully he's mature like I am he's not looking for sex. Maybe he really does like you and finds you very appealing and fun to be with. My advice is to give him a chance and see where it goes. Obviously you must becareful with him.|`|Kq8VPCBBaa	im not going to be a bi*ch and give you mean answer like some people on here.<br>  and i am going to tell you straight forward though..<br>  most guys really arent as nice as they seem so it may be best to get to know him a lot more. im sorry but age is nothing but a number hun.<br>  dont let people get you twisted up in that yoo.<br>  and if you dont plan on having sex with him make sure you let him know you will when your ready (if it gets that far).<br>  not all people are creeps because when i was a freshmen my friend was dating a senior and they dated for 3 years!<br>  he really loved her.<br>  hope this helped.|`|S41nRFKKaa	17 years old (Average USA)<br>  18 years old (Canada)<br>  What do they mean?<br>  A guy's last shot at piece of sweet, sweet, cherry pie.<br>  <br>  Wait until you're out of high school to have sex. And make it known to him if you do plan on going out with him.

Trust me hes up to no good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|LJiy79XHaa	Seniors are NOT interested in freshmen. It doesn't happen. At least, not in a mutually beneficial way. Anyway, either...<br>  <br>  a) He doesn't like you. He couldn't care less. Investing anything in him is a big mistake<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  b) He doesn't like you. He and his real girlfriend laugh about how he's leading you on. Investing anything in him is an even bigger mistake.<br>  <br>  I would advise you to break it off with him. Nothing good can come of your relationship. Find someone you have more in common with and be happy. Best of luck.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Most of the time it's about sex, but not all the time. He could really like you. But it's against the law for you guys to date. My advice would be to just take things slow..that way you could see his true intentions. I know alot of 18 year old guys that date 14 year old girls because they like them for them. But if your not so sure about him..just be very cautious.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	No no no no, a thousand times no!  14 is jail bait.  If the guy is smart, he'll not go on this date.  It only takes one small lie from anyone and the parents of the girl would have him put in jail for statutory rape.  He should know better but then you could be from Kentucky and they don't care.  Some of them marry their own sisters.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Jail, jail, jail, do not do this, stay just friends.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	No, and no...if you guys go overboard one night...you've committed a felony with her consent or not.  If her parents get midevil on your butt, which they are in their perfect right to do, you could do serious time.  She is not the age of consent, to my knowledge in any state in the union.  I don't know though, some of those southern states might not be so critical.  <br>  <br>  I get it, she looks at you and her eyes tell you that you are the greatest person and earth and she's in love.  She's 14..great challenge!  Sorry that was catty.....   It'll be harder to get girls your age interested but that where you are supposed to be.<br>  <br>  You'll do whatever you want, of course, and then there's the  - what do I know" factor to help you decide.<br>  <br>  Why don't you ask like a clergyman.  Or walk into a police station and ask them, in all innocent frankness about your situation.  Also, ask your Mom, and her Mom about your dating each other.  That should give you enough information.  She might go play with her Barbies if you break up with her...please sweetie...too easy, and too hard (as in time).<br>  <br>  Meow, sorry.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	i know when i was a freshman, seniors wanted to date us so they could hook up with us. we werent sluts, but grade 9 changes alot. they consider you to be "fresh meat" ... so you need to be careful who you choose.<br>  <br>  let him know your not easy, and your not just going to do stuff with him because hes older and "mature" .... <br>  if hes a good guy he WONT pressure you to do stuff. seriously, he will be respectful.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh ps: its legal.... it happens, seniors date freshman, no big deal!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I dated an 18 year old guy when I was 14. He was nice and smart. I think he actually liked me because I was smart and funny. He wasn't my longterm boyfriend but I did have a huge crush on him and we made out. A couple of years later I had sex with him but the relationship didn't work out. Of course you know that if he has sex with you then your parents could have him thrown in jail. So, keep that in mind. Otherwise I think you should use your instincts.|`|CQ8c0L9Caa	well since your both in high school, the age difference shouldnt be your biggest concern. alot of seniors just want easy freshman to get with, their going off to college so they want to be single for that and they want playtime their senior year with no commitment in the end. i dont think you should pursue your first serious high school relationship with a senior.|`|vUAjf0t1aa	Dahling, when I was 15 I had a senior come onto me. I thought it was all fun and games until he tried to get me to do something I was uncomfortable with...and that was that. He only wanted me to mack on. He wasn't interested in a relationship at all. AFTER he knew I wouldn't have sex with him, I was pretty much erased from his life. He didn't give a **** about me.<br>  <br>  Just wondering, what does living in Canada have to do with anything?<br>  <br>  But really, I wouldn't date him. You can hang out with him. Try hanging out with him.

Kaka poo poo head! That's funny. So is the fact that you think 14 is too young to be stupid.<br>  I agree with the other answers. When i was in school, we didn't hang around people that had more than a 1.5yr age gap either way ( Younger or older)<br>  <br>  I reckon that if they've both been known to lie, that you should be able to read between the lines. He says she asked him to get papers. Maybe she did. She says he actually stayed and smoked pot. Maybe he did.<br>  Maybe they're both telling the truth. He's just not telling you the whole truth.<br>  <br>  If you've got friends that smoke pot, and you don't have a problem with that, why would it "hurt you waay too much" if he did it? I think that if he wants to be stupid, you shouldn't stop him. And if he is lying to you, it's because he wants to work things out with you. But you can't stop him from being who he is.<br>  He's 18. Yes, it's illegal. But he'll probably grow out of it. And if he doesn't then you're too good for him and should set your sights on someone else.<br>  <br>  You're too young to be worrying about if he lied to you about smoking pot. Who cares if he did or didn't. Like i said before... Read between the lines. Check out how they're acting. If you feel weird around them, there's probably a reason.|`|uIjPLPcVaa	can i be ka-ka-poo-poo-head's friend?|`|yfwSDroNaa	why do u hang out with a 14year old?!?!<br>  anyway try to get info from both of them and try to see what info is in common. or u can tel ur ex bf to tell u the complete truth
rGjUyzpoaa	Think of what you really want. Do you really want her? I know myself I lied to a man I was madly in love with simply about being in love with him.  Nobody in life can say they have never told a " little white lie". However, sometimes you dont realize what one little lie can lead to. Are you willing to put the time and effort in? Truly? Can you ride the emotional roller coaster (cause it will be)? No matter what shenanigans she does? Cause telling someone you hurt/broke to "Just get over it" does not validate their pain, feelings, emotions, and frankly loss of trust (trust they placed in you because they wanted nothing more but to be with you). You want her to just get over it because you weren't the one it happened to. If it were you would you "just get over it"? She may run with alot of thing...But you provide the sneakers...Continue to stay open and honest... People in general don't judge you by what you say, rather what you do, they watch when you dont realize they are (similar to uncle sam, wink, wink). Cheating can be taken on many levels. Maybe you didnt " Cheat" on her, but you cheated her on the truth...Truth of the real you. If your madly in love you want her to see all of you.Dont you?<br>  Since there are odvious shadows of the truth and reality in this picture....Sit yourself down, Look at the future. Not only what you want but what you NEED. People too often place their wants over true needs. Look at your life in 20 Years, do you see her there?  If you know your life would be ok without her....You need to move on, and fast. Simple as that..<br>  2 things to leave you with; Its not loving the perfect person, rather loving the imperfect person perfectly.<br>  People spend their whole lives trying. Stop trying and just doooooo it. If thats what you really need.<br>   Good luck! Most importantly, GOD BLESS!|`|3NoQuoWuaa	You violated her trust. Only time and your actions can heal the wound. However, it is possible that she will never trust you again and you can look forward to checking up on you forever. She will have to forgive first before she will allow herself to trust. There doesn't seem to be anything more you can do. If she doesn't reach the acceptance level, you may be faced with breaking up. That's the price of cheating.r|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	You done screwed that one up. She obviously will continue to live in the past. Id that what you want twenty years from now? I'd be moving on.|`|1uRUaSblaa	She needs to restore her trust in you and that takes time. Be patient and help her clear all doubts whenever she feels insecure. Continue to let her check whatever she wants. If you have nothing to hide anymore, it should not be a problem. Talk to her and always reassure her that you love her.<br>  She needs time not just to regain trust in you but also to be healed from the past deceptions. It is good that you are choosing to be transparent with her now. I believe she will be fine if you continue to prove to her with words & actions that you have nothing to hide from her anymore and that she means a lot to you.

E8YCTcZ8aa	Yeah. I'm a guy, and we tend to text girls at late hours if we like them. NOt just for fun randomly. Trust me, he likes you.|`|R2RoNcLUaa	Flirting and liking are two different things. Guys enjoy texting girls as much as the other way around. He might just think you're attractive and want to get with you. You know that tingly feeling when you get when you text guys for long periods of time at night... yeah men get that too. But he might like you, depending on how well you know him.|`|nOst8VsJaa	Hells yeah he likes you. He was thinking of you at 12:30 in the morning so that is a definite YES! Was the conversation deep or was he just tryna find someone to keep him busy until he was able to fall asleep?|`|txx86rYHaa	mayb. depends sorta wat the txt said?|`|OEyyRqN0aa	yes he is somewhat into you|`|9Eq2Xxbmaa	ya sounds like it :)<br>  good for you :)|`|ZMZNUcqJaa	if he texted you at 12:30 he was obviously thinkin of you in some way and if it was a cute flirty message im sure he likes you :D|`|wDLlJfFiaa	Maybe he was bored. Sike naw, he probably couldn't sleep and kept thinking of you. So texted you, so he could talk to you!! Aww, girl you getting him!!|`|dKhD4QCaaa	Yes, I think so. And he could have. I once was up at 2:30 a.m. and i started texting this girl I liked, and she knew by that point.|`|TJl70Y6baa	hell yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ***** im a guy|`|WDzydKkWaa	if he would be able to get throw the phone to your bed and in your pants ...wow....he most probably.....Yes..!|`|PN7XMglOaa	girl , he's nuts over you .|`|wlaEnkc9aa	he might have talked to some other girls but yeah he might like you pretty sure not 100% sure|`|HZKsNwbeaa	he hates you if anything|`|81Qi6U7Xaa	He probably does.|`|VvFhqQwLaa	Sounds like it, if he texts you at 12:30|`|cAyGq4haaa	haha. yes he does :]|`|yeVISp3Maa	maybe|`|vQ7ZPbgaaa	that dont necessarily mean that...|`|YYzb7LoBaa	honey, he could've been talking to 8 other girls while he texted you.|`|HXNMPVJiaa	yes. no guy will waste his time with a girl hes not interested in. simple as that. trust me im a dude.|`|AA11338178	umm. duh.. haha<br>  i'm pretty sure you could've answered that for yourself. :D lol.<br>  NICE.!|`|OaVw7wcgaa	mhm probably!

If they don't, I get suspicious.  Sure he was talking to you and probably likes you.  I haven't met you, don't know you and still like you.  That is normal.  Find out about the guy and not whether he likes you or not. You already know the answer to that one.  You ask him questions. You ask his friends questions.|`|I6pmPb1Baa	he could of just been bored.<br>  but it SOUNDS like hes in to you.<br>  dont get your hopes too high though. :/|`|LQI3P7YZaa	I think so! but yet again he could of send it to other girls too...lets face it we have our guy friends who flirt alot! lol!<br>  hope I helped in somewhat.  :]<br>  Good Luck!|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	he likes you some what ,<br>  but he just home from a date and <br>  was bored!!|`|EVpsVgokaa	Sure...

Good luck!  :-D|`|W1asj1Nuaa	yep he does sweety?|`|22ef69433e60cdfed095dc6ca07e1bbcaa	12:30 am in the morning with a cute flirty message and then you talked for a long time after yes he most likely likes you because that proably means he was up thinking about you|`|46mCzLkAaa	What is with these annoying questions! "does he like me"<br>  <br>  Take your own word for it, it OBVIOUSLY seems that he does like you, it's too obvious, yet you ask this question..|`|v202XHZNaa	Most likely! Just hope for the best, don't let your guard down though|`|VyMgr2MJaa	well if he spent his time trying to talk to you he must be somewhat into you|`|oXnlk1yOaa	sounds like it if hes texting you at 1230 am.|`|Mwxuzq1Baa	I would think so
6d4mFbuYaa	The only thing I can think of is to ignore her. Bullies and people who like annoying others get really annoyed themselves when they're ignored - works all the time with my classmates who hate me. If you can't do that...Find out more about her and use her weak points against her. (Examples: Her ex-boyfriend, her crush, her old crushes, embarrassing things like infections in gross areas, and the like.) If you can't do THAT (that normally is the hardest thing) I go back to ignoring her. You can be extra nice and sweet to her and confuse her or really annoy her, that worked with me once. Normally bullies like to see someone flustered, annoyed, and flushed - basically someone about to snap. Being the exact opposite - brushed hair, calm, normal, and serene - can really really mess with their heads. :D Good luck with that, this was a bit long. Tell me how it goes out!!|`|2LJV50vhaa	First you contact the police, after you have taken a record of the times of the calls,all her calls will be logged at those times if it is her and she is stupid enough to use her own phone.Even withholding her number will not protect her.Your other option is to contact your phone provider who will then intercept your calls and stop her and even possibly lose her mobile account,they can scrap her mobile.|`|6ddNezzSaa	when she calls, say Pizza Hut, how may I help you? If she doesnt hang up, just say may I take your order? Hello? Then if she doesnt respond, say Ok im hanging up now. Then hang up.  If she calls back, say (name) hang up i know its you. then if she doesnt hang up, you hang up and dont answer the calls. sorry im not good with diabolical plans. maybe you could also prank call her with information about her (ex?) bf or something.|`|NRVBgvXxaa	i know what she's doing is so wrong and bitchy but it could back fire.<br>  <br>  if i were you i would spread a rumor about her, make sure you have some tapes of when she did call you (just incase the police is ever needed), and change the number.<br>  good luck!|`|59G6Ef11aa	Why would you want to lower your self to there games for?<br>  <br>  But if its bugging you that much change your number and only tell those who you can trust.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try having the number blocked?|`|yPncyjK1aa	Ignore her, that really annoys bullies!|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Just don't answer "withheld calls" etc.|`|18bb6ca5f4d5808abed2ed34b3660ef7aa	u can't really b serious?..if these calls are so annoying to you, y would u be willing to play the same game?..life is 2 short..don't answer when calls come up as "Withheld"..u seem 2 think u know who "Caller S" is so just confront her about it. If she denies it, drop it and leave it at that, but stooping to the same LOW level, isn't exactly revenge. ur better than that..put the effort into something or someone that's really worth it..|`|c55e0c0d1194f0accb3a414074d0247eaa	You don't have to answer the phone.  So don't.|`|bKxlLOdQaa	Can you change your phone number? Only give your new number out to friends you trust.|`|EWNO0rdjaa	just dont ever answer ur phone when its blocked|`|38hbMpH5aa	prank call her and say that your the manager of Louis Vuitton and say that she has bought like 10,000 pounds or whatever of products and they are going to get delivered to her house next week and she has requested to pay at her door in cash and your just calling to confirm that.<br>  sound really posh and strict and ring on her door the following week with you and you friend and RUN and phone her that evening  saying that she did not pay and she will send her to court.|`|y39iNwFjaa	Actually, I'd report her to the police! But if you think that's going to far, get hold of her mobile number from a mutual friend and ring it and blow a whistle down the phone every time she picks up. In the meantime, contact your mobile phone provider and ask if it's possible to have a block put on the number - they should be able to do that in spite of the fact that it's witheld.|`|f8xmQjdkaa	K, ready for this one?<br>  <br>  Don't answer your phone.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	What goes around comes around - find out HER number & do what she's doing back to her. Or answer the phone & say nothing. Silent treatment always works too.|`|JuhBsN76aa	record all the phone calls.<br>  <br>  and put them on youtube to showcase the immaturity of this person.<br>  <br>  this is a tactic, a devestating tactic where you pin the enemy down into submission and to an extent, unleash a furious response of unrivalled proportions.<br>  <br>  then again this could backfire on you, if the person doing the pranks ends up being a legend and wins a huge fan base lol <br>  <br>  if its a common occurance and happens more than 5 times a day, alert the authorities on this.  Its your peace and mind theyre messing with at the end of the day.|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	The idea of trying to get your own back isn't a good idea and can cause more problems, i would contact the police,that would be a good enough way to get your own back, as this person is abusing you by these calls and should be stopped, and why dont you let your phone ring and ring and let your phone go onto your answer machine and she will get fed up or leave an insulting message on the machine, and thats your evidence for police file of the abuse she is causing you.<br>  It does seem like one of your close friends has given her information so that friend i would say is fuelling her to abuse you.<br>  Make sure you tell all of your friends that this has been reported to the police and this will stop pretty quick, as the message will get around that someones going to get into trouble here, and It doesnt pay to take the law into your own hands, and you do not need this stress, just put a stop to this and you will have the last laugh believe me, good luck and do not worry let the police deal with it.|`|pvKbsrzaaa	hmmm, do u guys go too school together ?<br>  if so, during gym period get some purple, orange or green hair dye & put it into her shampoo.<br>  if u cant do it get a friend too do it.<br>  when walking past her in the cafeteria dump some food on her head >:D<br>  orrrrrrr<br>  record someone laughing very scarily & somehow hide it into her purse or room<br>  uhm i cant rele think of anything else.<br>  goodjob on the phone ideaa ^__^<br>  u could try googling stuff or ask some friends.
T1OFtmB5aa	Don't smother him.<br>  It's just the "honeymoon" has worn off for him.<br>  It might have nothing to do with you.<br>  Don't nag, just ask superficial questions about his mood like.<br>  Are you feeling alright?<br>  If you want to talk to me, I'm here for you.<br>  Give him some time, but don't give him all the time in the world either.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	drop him now   best thing for you ..|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Ease up he has some things going on ?? could be he's married ~ how well do you know this guy ~ or other girlfriends ~ either way is not good, get rid of him now and move on. That's very rude by the way. I wouldn't even want to be with someone who spoke to me that way.
E2OKRhwYaa	She thinks that you'll steal him from her which is ridiculous because she's already taken, you need to talk to her about this, you have every right to talk to whoever you want to and she should respect that and not ask you to not talk to your friend.|`|sduv9y7yaa	she's probably jealous but thats weird if she likes someone if she is already in a relationship

AA10877025	you like her so you need to talk to her next time she comes near ask the time or mention weather anything but staring like that might scare her off , could be that it's you catching her looking instead of the other way round she might like you too so try and make chat it'll help.|`|rlBpFz2waa	NO HAHA boys always stare at me i wouldn't worry it's normal, if i fancy them i stare it them, twiddle my hair, turn away, look back, lick my lips then drop something on the floor and bend over, they usually come running to help me.|`|rWtk4c37aa	Don't stare. look at her once in a while and see if shes looking. but if you look all the time, well lets just say that it is really creepy. Good luck with her!|`|7KXBvFitaa	Occasional glances are ok.<br>  But constant staring? That's just creepy. Tone it down a bit, otherwise you'll scare her off.
44039233745fd8568f8e6d256bcb3000aa	i wouldn't....he might just want sex and that all...after he gets it he might move on...i would just test the waters and hang out with him.<br>  if he really liked you, then he wouldn't care.|`|xcijW8LZaa	well if u guys are goin to do it then make sure u dnt do it at ur house cuz thats just sick man. Don't drag a shame in to ur family. do it somewhere else. if u want to do it then do it not cuz he wants to.|`|jilEKALUaa	Nah! Cancel it! You already stated what the odds would be against you. If you don't want a reputation then don't let yourself get one.|`|PTuSjgvNaa	the chances of him telling pople that you had sex are good.....i wouldnt do it...
vXubuAqzaa	i wouldnt mind but sometimes i would say well hunny cant u skip that tonight and come home and visit with the family a little before the kids go to bed?|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i know that when i was home on maternity leave, i called my fiance all the time. i was bored alot and lonely and scared w/ our first baby. and when he get home, i would just ATTACK. i wanted adult converstation and help!<br>  <br>  anywho, so i talked to my mother and she made me realize that he needs a break too.  he's at work, so when he comes home, he needs down time too. so in saying that, would be annoyed and hurt because i would want him to want to spend time w/ me as much as i want to spend time with him. but i would also understand that he has a life outside of me and our child. sooo<br>  <br>  i would let it go and explain that in the future you would like a heads up..more than just a few mins before.<br>  <br>  and. i would take some alone time too.  you'll wont be resentful if you have some alone time without the kids.<br>  <br>  sometiems i just go in our bedroomo and read..while my fiance watches our son.<br>  <br>  now i'm back at work, but we still give each other alone time. it's a life saver.<br>  <br>  ps. my fiance said he would have to kill me if i was a SAHM because i just would call him all the time. i know it gets boring and lonely. i was only home for 6 weeks, so i can imagnie if it were YEARS. ugh. couldn';t do it. i was busy with our baby too, but i love my man and wanted him around...wanted any adult around.<br>  <br>  ooops. didnt read all of it. but my man works late a lot and i would get sooo  pissed. but now, i realize that he IS doing it for us, but he gets paid. and i think your man is either an overachiever or he just doesnt want to come right home. talk to him about it.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I think it's about compromise.  You can say it straight up without getting nasty or whiny--he has to let you know earlier when he plans to stay, and ask him to limit the later nights to a set amount.  Meanwhile, be thankful you can afford to sit home with your kids--I would have loved to have had that opportunity.  I can understand that you want adult conversation, but aren't there any other "soap-opera-and-bon-bon" mothers in the neighborhood that want company also? (And maybe want to talk about more than soap operas and bon-bons?)  : )|`|krQiDGCHaa	All I really see here is a problem that can easily be solved with a little communication.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd sit down with my husband when he gets home the next time he isn't staying late to work on his project.  Tell him you love him very much and that you and the kids miss him when he stays late for his projects -- also, sometimes you just need a break from being with the kids all day, and also just want a little adult interaction with your husband. :)<br>  <br>  Explain to him that you understand he needs to just stay late sometimes for his own little outlet, but that you'd like it to be a little less frequent.  Also let him know that you understand he doesn't know until the end of the day, but if he could call as soon as he knows he will be staying late, that would be great.  Tell him if you are in the middle of cooking dinner you and the kids will be eating without him, and you will put a plate in the fridge for him to re-heat on his own when he arrives home.<br>  <br>  Make a deal that he stay no more than 2 (or 3) hours any night, and that it be no more than once a week.  I'm sure once hears how torn up his wife is about this, he will be more than willing to compromise to try to make both of you happy.  He seems to be a good husband. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|e1oky4jSaa	Well I can understand how you are bored and want him home. I suggest getting a little more of a life of your own instead of depending on him for your happiness; make some other mom friends, join a playgroup, SOMETHING so that you don't have your husband as your only source of adult entertainment. Good luck.|`|LqyOHY37aa	Talk to him and let him know how you feel and maybe come to a compromise on how often he stays late. Also arrange a date night now and then.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No - I wouldn't mind at all - assuming this machine is going to be useful?!  My husband works side jobs all the time for extra cash.  I could never be upset at that...|`|scMMpPciaa	I would encourage him to go..I get more things done faster and better when he isn't around.<br>  |`|31e2812ba8d774ab20eb2a5c9bfb9ff8aa	Yes I would be annoyed.  I think it would be best if you two sat down and worked out a schedule, like 2 days out of the week where he stays late and only those two days.  Pick 2 days and stick to those 2 days like Tuesday and Thursday and then it won't be so unpredictable.  His family should be his priority and spending time with the family is so important. These times are irreplaceable, he will truly regret it if he makes a habit of this.<br>  <br>  btw, to be honest I just don't think when parents have babies there is really anytime for hobbies, it's just the way it is.  Maybe something that we can do for a few hours once a week but babies/toddlers need lots of time and energy put into raising them.|`|YVWlAvqEaa	I would definitely mind if this is something that happens a lot during the week. Maybe it would be good if he cut this project down to two nights a week. It's not fair to your children that they don't get to see their father. And he should know that they miss him when he doesn't come home. Just because he works and supports you guys financially does not mean that he shouldn't be home supporting you emotionally as well. There has to be a perfect medium there to be able to do both, but on a better schedule.|`|hH6kGUvBaa	He just has a hobby. why not ask questions and learn from it. At least he isn't hanging around bars buying drinks for a bunch of trollops. I have my hobbies too and I am a painter. He knows when I am at home. He came home early and he loves to putter in the garage. We are having an early dinner together. Let him build his machine and watch him and have fun. I bet he would enjoy sharing his ideas with you.|`|nv4QV1OVaa	Nope, you're right. But take this into consideration: What he does obviously is a big part of who he is. To want to stay at work to make something on the side shows that he likes what he does and he's a tinkerer. That's his personality. I bet if you asked his mom he probably was one of those kids that took things apart all the time. Don't fault him for that and allow him to be happy; but make sure in a positive way that he understands that he may be neglecting the people that should matter the most to him. He may not realize it. <br>  <br>  I would maybe ask him to set the days that he stays over. That way you'll know when and not get frustrated when you work hard to make supper and he's not home. Don't try to take it away from him completely; but come to a compromise.<br>  <br>  I would also focus on getting him some interesting 'tools' to have at home so he can do his tinkering there more often. He may get your oldest involved in it too; and there is no better way for a father to bond with his kids. Christmas is a great place to start! Good luck.|`|31f614cbe7e57a932bcf7cefd3e9dc1baa	If you know he is not cheating; let him work hard.<br>  You are lucky to be able to stay home and raise your children.  I would love to be able to do that...(if I was married with kids)<br>  <br>  Maybe ask him to stay less at work?<br>  I just think appreciate what he is doing for you guys as long as he isn't cheating!<br>  |`|TM96VFcgaa	I would be annoyed too! I am a sahm to 3 kids and at the end of the day I need a break! I would maybe ask if he can only do it 2-3 times a week? Or maybe if he comes home enough to a cold dinner he'll change his mind. Good luck!|`|jEwhYGp8aa	I know exactly how you feel. I am a mom of 4 kids, all 4 and under. I never get a break, while my husband goes to work, and then sleeps all day.  |`|VVtr54Myaa	He's providing for his family isn't he??? Quit complaing and count your blessings dear.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	To Tiger-Lily:  Being a SAHM IS a job.  And I would challenge anyone who doesn't think so to try it.  Not having your husband come home after work to give you some down time would be like your boss coming up to you at 4:55 and telling you you needed to work a few more hours.  It is lonely to be at home with kids by yourself all the time.  People with outside jobs get to socialize with adults and are not constantly around people who are TOTALLY dependent on them.  And if you child is wanting to see his father more, he needs to make more time for his family. |`|IsgzeE0Faa	To me it sounds like your upset about the lack of time he spends with you and how your becoming number 2 priority in his life. i went through that with world of warcraft, i would spend my free time on that game and put my wife on the back burnner... not a good idea, i am now trying to fight to keep my marriage. if he can find a balance on family and extra cirricular activities there shouldnt be a problem, but that just depends on how much time you let him spend making machines|`|RO865B8Taa	It's fair to say he will need to stay late now and then, but he also has some responsibility to his family and wife. <br>  The last minute notice is irksome, but perhaps you could start by establishing guidelines. You can request that he stays no more than twice a week - and explain WHY - that you miss him and want (and need) adult companionship... <br>  When he does need to stay, perhaps you could try inviting a friend over for yourself to help finish the dinner you've begun when your husband isn't there to enjoy it. You might find you've neglected your female friends, and this is a way you can get back in touch with them.<br>  I imagine if you start to have a lot of fun with your friends when he stays late, he might find it less important to stay at work (?).<br>  |`|otO7CIIlaa	Maybe you should just focus on being a good mother to your children, focus on what you can do to make you happy and let him have his space.  It may be essential to his happy.  People have to have something other work and home to feel fulfilled sometimes, if he has a hobby that's interesting to him, let him have that individuality and find things that make you have yours.|`|zTzWFq5xaa	Give him the suggestion that he could implement a schedule for using the machines so that he will know that there will be one available because he signed up to use it.  So maybe he stays late on Tuesdays and Thursdays and comes home right after work the other nights.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, maybe you find out if there is another place that he can use those types of machines where he can schedule time to use them so that his projects don't get in the way of your relationship.<br>  <br>  If neither of those things work out, maybe you should find a hobby of your own, possibly one you can do with friends (let them know the wacky scheduling issue) then on the nights he calls, pack up the kids and head out or invite your friends over and have some fun without your husband.|`|otTslvAOaa	sit him down and tell him..... that you need his company around the house more.<br>  <br>  tell him that it is okay to work late on occasion, but never more than twice a week.|`|9BXhgKFcaa	I wouldn't mind ,but I'll try to keep myself busy as well ,maybe make some friends and invite them over sometimes

Just calm down and make some hard decisions.<br>  NO ONE BUT YOU knows how YOU should deal with this.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	there is no way you can forgive someone who lies, covered it up, won't show remorse, and who hides his passwords on his phone. when a man is sorry and wants forgiveness he would be humble, and apologetic, he is not showing this to u. he is arrogant, disrespectful, and hiding things, and being secretive with his wife, someone he was suppose to love. i am a firm believer that a man who loves his wife won't do this. because love isn't like this. he has met someone else, and when they do this its almost impossible to get them back, no matter what u do or say. u could jump through hoops and it wouldn't matter. i divorced my cheating husband, for not only being a cheater, but a liar and u can't fix something that's not even going to be acknowledged. does he think your a fool? and you can't see it.|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	Stay calm. DON'T resort to violence or arguing. It is absolutely pointless to get yourself worked up into a state of emotional frenzy.<br>  <br>  Think about your future without him in the picture. There are always negatives and positives. Make your plan, get the advice of an attorney and follow through with it.<br>  <br>  If you have had previous bad experiences in the marriage, I would think that you are really wasting your time and energy by staying. You need to do what is best for you and your child.|`|snrc1Dmsaa	Well if he did cheat then it was around the time he was emotionally stressed due to the argument he was having with you and the death of his grandmother. although its a normal human response to find love elsewhere in times of domestic tension, he approached this situation the wrong way - that is to say if he did really cheat. do you know for a fact the person he was calling is a women?<br>  <br>  however if i was in your shoes i would be suspicious of his activities as well. its time to sit him down and have a serious conversation with him. not about whether or not he's cheating, but about how he's coping with his grandmothers death and the domestic tension the both of you have been experiencing. perhaps then, he'll reveal the truth.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	At first I was slightly skeptical but as soon as I saw that he changed the passwords and pin code and VM access code I will tell you this:  THAT IS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.  Now only you know what you have to do.|`|7yBnUyVgaa	Its not for sure that he cheated on, its a strong possibility but don't directly go to conclusions...|`|Z3l08BDAaa	you dont know he cheated on you,youre assuming that.why dont you call the number and see who picks up if you want answers.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Leave him ...never stay with a CHEATER because of the kids...is that the enviroment you want him raised in?|`|BPNAcSpVaa	You didn't catch him cheating. You caught him calling somewhere that you have no idea what it is. You have trust issues, you are looking for a way out of the marriage.

You need to stop snooping and grow up. Sometimes if you accuse him of cheating over and over again, he will, just to get away from your b!tchiness, you better back off before you ruin your life, because being a single mom isn't fun. What he could do is file against you and try to get custody and make you pay support, that happens when the mother is delusional and psychotic.***|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Be careful my dear. I know you are emotional, but you have to work from your HEAD and not your heart on this one. You need a plan and to calm down. The October 2008 issue of Essence magazine (doesn't matter what color you are - the magazine is gooood) has a great article about cheating and getting it together before you just leave. When I separated I had no CLUE the financial ruin I'd go into while my cheating husband prospers exponentially. It makes everything hard and hurt more, creates resentment and makes my children suffer. So, be smart and be sure to get healing through prayer and loving and caring for yourself.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	you are working with assumptions right now. Assuming he cheated isnt fair. assume positive intent unless you have proof he actually did cheat. Like the others said, if you want answers call the number but dont divorce him if you are not 100% sure he cheated unless you are unhappy and want out of the marriage.|`|AA11825142	Well the fact that he won't even come clean shows he isn't really sorry or he would let all the information out. Maybe in the next few days he will realize that he has to fess up if he wants to try to keep your marriage together. But changing password and pin numbers... that just shows he is covering up alot of information.|`|lckgvz2laa	Definitely divorce him. No you do not deserve this, and he doesn't deserve to have you. Or his son.|`|ekr6BBe3aa	For all you know it was a preacher or crisis center and he was embarrassed to tell you and unwisely decided to try and lie his way out of explaining his grief issues. It may also be a mistress. Don't just guess, get facts to go on.|`|yL9To7Nzaa	i'm so sorry sweetie. my advice would be to write him a letter explaining all of it. include that you would like to schedule a time (when ur son is sleeping) to sit down and talk like adults. i would probably write something ahead of time consisting of all the things u want to say b/c in the heat of the moment you'll probably lose track. if he does choose to meet you and talk, then see from there. if he chooses to ignore it all together, then talk to a divorce lawyer and take all he's worth!!! as for your son, it'll be okay. as long as the both of you handle a divorce in a mature way. Never put your son in the middle, don't talk badly about the other parent in front of him, and things should go fairly smooth. <br>  he clearly feels bad about it because he's trying to act as if it didn't happen. he prolly did it cause he was hurting over his grandma? and blah blah blah he'll have some lame excuse. it doesn't make it right, nor does it make it hurt any less for you. just know that you don't deserve to be treated that way, and i wish you and your family (ur son that is, not the husband) good luck! =)|`|bmWKETgWaa	Go to this site and look up whose phone number it was:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.whitepages.com/reverse_phone" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitepages.com/reverse_phone</a><br>  <br>  They make the listings from the phone book, so if the number was disconnected fairly recently, the information should still be available.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Sounds to me like you don't really have proof.

If you don't your going to be miserable and you are going to make his life a living hell because you are not going to trust him to do anything by himself. and yeah, a $710 phone bill! there is no excuse for that. Call it and ask the B*&%$ how  long its been going on.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	In a guys perspective, making a phone call is not cheating. Even if it was a 900 number, your case is about as solid as him watching porn. Not really taking his side because a lot of men are dogs. He probably did cheat but your evidence is thin so he won't admit to it. Doesn't seem like a healthy marriage if you don't notice him missing between 2-4 am. Call that show Cheaters and have a PI follow him around. Right now my only advice would be to work on the marriage and get a better long distance provider. $700, that's ridiculous!|`|icfI36gvaa	my parents got divorced because my dad cheated. he was an *** for cheating and is an *** in general. im glad my parents got a divorce because now my mom can live her life without dealing with his cheating. she knew he was cheating on her since i was in kintergarden, now im 18 and she didn't leave him until i was in 8th grade. she stuck around for wayyyy too long and only because she had 4 kids. she regrets staying with him for so long and i do too because i always had to deal with them screaming and my mom crying. it was a bad living environment.<br>  <br>  keep this in mind when making your decision.<br>  best of luck!|`|chlvKoXqaa	so if he admits it then what? what would you do? divorce? what if he never did it again. take that number to a private investigator see if there's anyway he can trace who the name to that number was, then tell your husband you contaced her and she admitted it. maybe it was some crazy phone sex number.|`|i0HfoMteaa	its really not cheating until you catch him in the act he could be just talking to the person, maybe even flirting but i don't think its at the point where u should considered a divorce........I suggest you take some time to your self maybe go away for a while.|`|ac2f5ef06e68bf5831f356893ee96effaa	go investigate some more.|`|QsyMkGzAaa	Drop him<br>  Call your lawyer<br>  Take all his money<br>  He deserves it.|`|1xNsWOnOaa	Try to be very calm and ask him just to tell you the truth.  If he tells the truth early it is much easier to get over it.  If he lies for a long time than it is the lies that will hurt more than the cheating.  Were you having problems before that would lead to this?  Were you intimate with him?  Were you arguing alot?  Was he close to his grandma?  Could he have freaked from that?  If you feel he really was cheating, let him come clean...have you tried calling the number?|`|7gsVxy5Saa	Maybe you should get more evidence because you were probably freaking out and just thought you were 100% sure that he was cheating so make sure you know what you're talking about. and if it's true then he's an asshole by not telling you, and you should leave him anyway since you'll get child support. I would rather be alone and peaceful than being lied to. hope this helps and no offense.|`|DhbwlfMgaa	hello i was just looking through and couldny help but notice you need a helping hand, at the age of 14 i know i may not be the perfect person to recive your advise from b ut a couple of years ago my parents split up and i would like to say when your much younger as a child it doesn't seem to effect you that bad if your parents split up from a younger age as it te3nds to fade in the memory a bit easyier as your too young to understand whats going on but thats my advice at the end of the day it will always be your choice if you love your partner every body deserves a second chance soo there go :)

NEVER do vaginal AFTER anal, that will cause a very nasty infection. Take your time and go very very slowly.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You either want to try or you don't.

TssgwSyvaa	okay remember three things and you'll be fine:<br>  1) SMILE<br>  2) laugh<br>  3) eye contact<br>  <br>  smiling is the most important. guys want a happy girl, not a girl who's always mopey, or a girl who seems bored around him. <br>  <br>  always laugh at his jokes. if he tries to be funny, but you don't think it's funny, still laugh! don't go crazy and laugh your butt off, but just like laugh a little to make him feel good<br>  <br>  always make eye contact with your guy when you're talking with him and smile while you're doing it. don't make eye contact while you guys are walking, cause that'll be kind of weird, but make sure to look him in the eyes when he's talking to you.<br>  <br>  ok some other tips:<br>  - don't text or talk on the phone with your friends when you're with him. it'll make him feel unimportant and left out, like you'd rather talk to someone else than be with him.<br>  - to be flirty, always be close to him. then give him a lot of space, then get close to him again (physically and emotionally). don't always be clingy or else he'll feel suffocated, but do it like on and off so that when you're off, he'll miss being close to you, and it'll draw him in<br>  - if you go on a date with him, where something classy and casual. never put too much effort into it (like too much makeup, or too much perfume, or too fancied up clothes) or else he'll feel awkward and no one likes a girl who tries too hard.<br>  <br>  good luck =)|`|AA12168964	You already know him and he knows you---so the tough part is already done---what you should have answered is--I cannot go to this movie--but I would like to go at another time.

Have fun and good luck|`|rak8dIh4aa	a good idea would be to NOT be cute and flirty. he might think u are flirty with other guys and to some of us that is a turn off.<br>  <br>  just tell him. gosh. why do ppl always think they have to do something. i think the whole world needs to grow a pair and tell ppl straight up whats goin on instead of beating around the bush.<br>  <br>  ok. off the soapbox.|`|LqsqMglraa	be yourself hon, dont act too eager but let him know that at a later date in time, you'd LIKE to goto movies with him, this will for sure let him know u like him in sorts|`|1jxGLs5waa	To show him u like him try being "touchy" like touch his arm and stuff.|`|CBa9G4j4aa	Act interested and like he is the only guy that you will pay attention to!

Flirt w/him when you are texting him.  Send him sexy pics to his phone (but where you're wearing clothes since you don't know him that well & since he might show the pics to others).  If he has a scarf or a hat, take it off of him without asking one day & wear it.  Ask him to go to the movies when you can go so you can progress beyond flirting...|`|NUciANHQaa	This is easy make him want you! touch him a lot and say that he looks cute and right when he starts eating out of the palm of your hand take it a way for a while then bring it back and soon enough he will be crazy about you<br>  But make sure your not cruel!|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	AWWWWW.lucky girl. <br>  1.

Anybody can tell you that the back is more drama than anything. For one (regardless of what people think, it's for your safety) start doing things differently. Meaning finding another way of getting home or possibly letting authority know the situation that your going through. Then they can better help you. Also (I know you may not want to) let your parents know what's going on. Pertaining to the guy you may want to just leave him alone. Not to burst your bubble but you don't know if he is involved with anyone in that group or what not. Not speaking relationship wise.|`|sT7YnwBSaa	lol what a funny story... she do naughty things to you... offer yourself to her... like...

OHfZFR31aa	You should talk to her about it beforehand. Tell her that you feel the relationship is getting serious and would she be interested in taking it to the next level. You also need to discuss birth control as well as what would happen if she were to get pregnant before you sleep together. Would she keep the baby? Give it up for adoption? Have an abortion? Would you stick with her and help her raise the baby?<br>  <br>  She also would need time to get on contraception and give it time to work. If she decides to go on the Pill, she needs to be on it for at least a month before you have sex in order for it to be effective|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	Do not ask her untill she initiates it|`|yd4bTuWOaa	if you ask her let her know that you are not pressuring her only asking. and if she says no then leave it at that, no convincing or anything means no pressure.|`|z2eEgDk4aa	if you do ask her, don't whine about it and try to convince her if she says no.

It is also a little tricky to ask and then plan because you two would be very nervous before it took place.  I would just ask her one day what her thoughts are on getting more serious and expressing your feelings in that way.  If she sounds like she's ok with it and is just nervous then ask her if it was something she would like to do eventually.  If she seems to dismiss it as if that isnt an option right now then let her approach you about it.  Make a comment like if you ever want to talk about taking it to the next level, just talk to me about it.  That way she doesnt feel like she has a time line to give you an answer and every time you two get together alone again your not going to expect it.|`|wvH6xzqjaa	if u pressure her, she's not going to want 2. so i suggest' u ask if she would have sex with u! not if she wants 2! and things might move along smoothly 4 ya. simply ask like 4 example: would u have sex with me, i dont mean now, but would you?  and u might just right then and there or soon/sooner|`|kzIVGEfgaa	Ease into the question. Ask something like how do you feel about sex. <br>  <br>  I have felt that I wanted to but I haven't because I don't think that I could, at this point in time, handle the consequences if the worse were to happen. <br>  <br>  Ask her opinion and it will go from there|`|WPqKmsX9aa	based on my religion i would wait but im not telling you to do that, if you really want this with her than just ask, but tell her its okay to say no, if you dont then you might push her away from you.|`|3OcR5eFraa	You could just pull her aside and let her know you've been thinking about having sex and what are her ideas about it. Fully explain your for whatever she wants. Its important for girls to know their not being pressured at all.

You guys can plan if she can get some birth control pills or get fitted for a diaphragm from her doctor. Or you should find out what condoms are best for you. You should have her use contraceptive cream in addition to the condom in case it breaks. <br>  Personally, 16 seems too young to me. I was never that lucky in high school. <br>  But you need to see all the issues that are involved, marriage, children. The parks are filled with single moms that had sex in high school "just to try it and see what it feels like." If they only knew what going into labor feels like (as a guy I will never know), they'd probably join a convent.|`|0SsDES85aa	just be nice about it and ask her if she is ready, and if she wants to.  good luck :)
PAEImaUraa	your definitely not asking for too much, hes not keeping up his end!<br>  I think you just wanted the thought, not really the gift right? Im not sure, but maybe you should talk to him about how your feeling, so that he understands whats going on. It would kinda suck if your bf or gf broke up with you and  you didn't know why. And if you think he knows whats wrong, i would still bring it up. Let him know that you care about him, but if he doesn't wanna give anything for the relationship, than why should you.<br>  hope it works out =]|`|gmXvrbhoaa	it sounds like this guy has got too comfortable with you and is taking you for granted...tell him how you feel and if he doesn't change his ways i know it will be hard but move on.<br>  I'm in the dog house this week and know i have some ground to make up and have had flowers and chocolates sent to the workplace of my partner every day this week,if i did what your boyfriend does i'd have to purchase a florists shop and i still wouldn't be forgiven!|`|AA10416015	Tell him you want to spend more time with him and try to get that 'spark' back into the relationship.

You need to talk to him about how you're feeling.  If things don't change, I would get out of the relationship.|`|lxA7bGTCaa	not bad... questionable, but not bad...|`|woUh3KL7aa	Sorry, he's not that into you.<br>  Drop him and find someone who will really appreciate you.|`|LHBoxAJOaa	no just go and talk to him and see what is going on with him yes u should  stay and work things out |`|CqHzPD1faa	dude... go back to bed, wake up and never ask this again. we'll pretend that you didn't|`|iouNG47vaa	ok..|`|7n7Jrq96aa	no your not asking too much. if u want someone that will show u more attention than u either need to tell your boyfriend everything that u just typed or u need to find someone else to be with. Its that simple.|`|9299f2e9813fb3d23d2a433eb2b99347aa	You've got to quit comparing your relationship with others, and more importantly your past relationship!  If your previous boyfriend was so great and spoiled you, why did you break up? (sarcasm, by the way)<br>  Talk to him and be honest about how you feel.  I am willing to bet that he knows that you are feeling this way and it's made him feel inadequate so that's why he's being distant.  Men need to feel like the provider and take care of their partner...it's the John Wayne (or Tarzan)complex.     |`|Vd3475Tyaa	No, I do not think you're asking too much. Your "boyfriend" is self absorbed and well, a dick. He obviously doesn't care about you very much to not have the curtosy to buy you at least chocolate or flowers for your birthday, and he doesn't sound very motivated to find a decent job. You being jealous of him always being/spending money with his friends is totally understandable, and he should consider your feelings.<br>  You should talk to him and tell him that if he doesn't change, than you need to leave because he is not going to bring you down with him.|`|DbCO4ThNaa	Your not asking for too much. If anything you have let him get away with him giving you too little. You need to tell him how you feel about this. Alot of guys ( my bf ) will be like yea whatever. I eventually left him , but he came crawling back and now he spoils me !!!!! Point is everyone deserves to be spoiled here and there.|`|sGXaFdMXaa	Not at all. Take a good look because this is how the rest of your life will be with him.|`|agLImxKTaa	He had a job fall through and doesnt make much money...  you are asking if you should leave him because he doesn't have money to spend on you and it makes you jealous of your friends who have boyfriends who buy them stuff and take them places.  For his sake, yes you should leave him.  You don't want a bf, you want a sugar daddy.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	If you're not getting what you want out of this relationship then it isn't a good one.  You should leave and find someone that does give you what you want.  Dating is about finding out if you're compatible with someone and if your wants aren't being met then obviously you're not compatible.  |`|UuxLLNNoaa	I don't think your asking to much but I would tell him how you you feel.|`|ri4Y9Lmbaa	You are definitely not asking too much.<br>  <br>  Kick him to the curb. He'll stay for as long as you let him and he'll get away with as much (or as little) as you'll accept. He seems to lack ambition and has no desire to woo you, so wash him out of your hair. You are better off without him and don't need anyone to bring you down.  <br>  <br>  Start spoiling yourself! Take some time just for you and eventually someone better suited for you will be delighted that you are his perfect match!
qqLcvDDKaa	Every gesture, the way you look at him, the way you talk to him, what you say to him. He would eventually know that you like him.|`|ztrRs62Daa	Here's the thing: guys are really dumb. At least, a lot of them are. They just don't get hints. You need to make things blaringly obvious to them or they won't take notice. Make it obvious you are a sexy, fun, interesting, intriguing and available individual who he could do a lot worse than. But make sure you don't embarrass yourself.. If you can keep your cool, you should tell him outright and if he says he's not into you just be like 'okay, that's fine' and act normal.. Even if it's tearing you up inside.. If you can't do that  and know that you would run crying from the room if he rejected you (And I know I would. Run crying, I mean, not reject you. Though I would reject you because I'm straight. Nothing personal!) then perhaps you could just try it on with him sort of jokingly when out with friends? Then if he responds in a serious way, it's good news, woo! But if he replies sort of jokingly then it's a bit iffy.. Maybe he's covering his true feelings, like you, or maybe it wouldn't ever occur to him that you were being serious!<br>  <br>  I guess.. Guys are oblivious to a lot of things. Maybe he doesn't think of you as more than a friend simply because it's never occurred to him that he should or could.. But if you were to plant the idea in his head, that could work!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|waA0uBXdaa	take it from me,<br>  he's probably gay.<br>  no doubt about it.<br>  queer.<br>  fag.<br>  gay.<br>  homo.<br>  it's a lost cause baby girl.<br>  lost cause...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|b8FRvTVmaa	Being "a friend" sucks so bad and i know how it feals but ive never heard of a guy just wanting to be friends unless he is gay|`|tysVIluYaa	FLIRTT(;<br>  haha, or try and indirectly hint you wanna be more than friends, and hope he gets it. <br>  tell a friend to tell him that your into him. <br>  good luck,<br>  and btw, its better your freinds first, so you know much more about him<br>  lols answr mines pleeeease someone?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226181952AAKw5qn">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  tanxx(;|`|07lzuFwPaa	Do/talk about things that you know he is into, like activities etc. <br>  maybe you should just tell him that you're interested.|`|jHLELmhFaa	I think you could start to get to know him more.<br>  Act like your interested.<br>  -Bre|`|1jIzBUkhaa	find out what his favorite colors are and try to get something to wear in that color, set by him all the time. be where he go's alot. then say your amazing i would love to be more than just a friend to you . then look into his eyes.|`|AA12117694	just be friends...I know the feeling a girl did the same to me.

SLnS5DAwaa	It's not weird at all to want to wait for marriage. Marriage costs money, and has a lot of legal things along with it as well. It's a life-long commitement, so wanting to wait until after college is perfectly normal. If anything it's the smart thing to do.|`|Q8JeA1eNaa	You'll wait if you loves her.She says education is more important.you are junior in high school.Wait some.
MKmj96hUaa	For a relationship to last a lifetime, it has to survive many things.<br>  <br>  If you think about a lifetime commitment, there will be times when either one of the partners will at some stage not be in the mood for sex.<br>  <br>  If sex has entered the relationship too early, this can cause a rift to develop. The partner who may not feel like sex (perhaps due to being tired, pregnant, running after children, overworking, etc.) may feel obligated to consent to sex as a way of 'keeping the partner happy'.<br>  <br>  If either partner consents to sex in this way, then the sex becomes a chore. The relationship thus becomes poisoned by resentments and falsehoods.<br>  <br>  If sex can be delayed, the relationship has a chance to develop free of this sort of pressure, and each of the parties involved can develop confidence in each other that they are not only in it for the sex.<br>  <br>  Sex, if brought in too early, can harm a couple's chances of discovering for themselves and for each other a more sustainable basis for their love.<br>  <br>  It also leads to too many people becoming cynical about love. Serial monogamy is a common result.<br>  <br>  I am not religious, but I have learned this all through my own experiences.<br>  <br>  If sex enters too early, relationships can still last and still be good ones, but it is my experience that jumping in bed too early usually causes more harm than good.|`|U4TeE4M6aa	because unlike wat u hav with ur partner, they just hav sex 2 satisfy an urge where as u and ur bf make love 2 each other|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Probably because it happened to them and they don't want to see it happen to you. Every relationship is different.|`|dIYj73zHaa	Well, I think what these people are referring to is that there is some kind of mystery or a curious type of attraction when you first meet someone. After you have sex, most often then not- at least for guys- it's gone, and we move on to something new. That's why there's a lot of one night stands; but I don't think it applies to people who are already in a committed relationship like you.|`|k8EmTYo7aa	I think it's a fear tactic by people who disapprove of premarital sex, are ignorant of human reproductive biology, and feel compelled to press their beliefs on others. It's well documented that sex leads to the release of oxytocin, a hormone that makes people feel bonded to each other, so sex has the exact opposite effect they're trying to claim. Your endocrine system neither knows nor cares whether you have a marriage license on file somewhere.|`|9jfQPzpiaa	because they don't want you to make the mistake of accidentally having a child before you're ready to take the even farther step of getting married.|`|BDlM6387aa	because sometimes the other partner is only in it for sex or cause u don't spend time communicating and it may be a little awkward the next day for younger people|`|2xK9W6a5aa	Thats crap from the extreme religious right so that you will not have sex until married.<br>  <br>  Obviously the act itself brings you closer!<br>  <br>  What actually drives people away from each other is not having sex until married and then once married finding out that there is no sexual chemistry between the two of you.<br>  <br>  You only live once, so have as much sex as possible and dont live in the olden days. Its 2008 now, its not 1867 anymore...|`|BrAhvlfOaa	because some people are just looking for that 'fling' that they can use and throw away like a kleenex.  they may only be looking to get something out of you other than love, and you never want to be with someone like that.  abstaining til marriage, or at least for a while, shows that you are committed, and that's always good.|`|o4ejuZYbaa	only sex with other people than their partner drives couples apart

NqvyaTxhaa	The longer he leaves seeing the parents the worser hes making it for himself. the quicker he meets them the better then its out the way then.
BbEo2HOzaa	First of all, you can text him anytime because when he finds the time he will text you back.<br>  <br>  As long as he answers your texts you will know that he is interested and this will help to keep your friendship on the front burner.  The longer you keep in touch, the stronger your friendship will get. <br>  <br>  However, if you wait too long, then you may get trapped in the "friend zone."  This may prevent you from moving to the next level unless you give him the impression that you want to take it further.  Learn the subtle gestures of body language to let him know that you really like him.|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	text him, text him, text him.<br>  tell him that you think he's cute, can't wait to see him, "we should find time to hang out sometime" blah blah blah.  you have his number so use it to your advantage!|`|1jIzBUkhaa	just start texting him , and say i really like you alost wish we could be together more.|`|QHt8fM1Oaa	be careful not to hurt your friend but if you wanna be more than friends take it slow dont go to fast and try to not talk about the same things everyday hehe|`|1JVAZbt7aa	how do you like him if you only see him twice a year?<br>  i dont get that|`|LDiZJp98aa	well the best thing that you can do it when you do talk to him, and you want him to know that you like him talk about something involving that you like him for example talk about or ask him what he things about relationships or what he things about that and his personal oppion on that and just take your time and gradualy start to incorperate things that say that you like him but not actually saying it if you know what i meen.|`|5UEevF68aa	this takes guts be strong but a small wink takes a large step sayin your interested but don't wanna get to close to fast! Oh and remember guys like fast but not with love! I learned this lesson the hard way. Don't worry, just try ur best u'll be ok!!|`|0WlX5Jvhaa	Well this a going to be very difficult. Only seeing him twice a year is not a lot. Even though you like him, its going to be way too stressful to be in a relationship with him. Your friend likes him too. He seems to have an interest if he wanted wanted your number. You should tell him flat out that you like him and if he likes you back, be friends first. Get comfortable  talking to each other and get to the point yous can talk about anything. open up to him, talk about anything too see if yous have a common interest and start from there. That's all I can tell you. But good luck|`|gCptw4gMaa	When you see him drop those hints. Play with your hair or a necklace when you talk to him. Poke him or subtly tease him in a playful manner\. He'll notice the difference and begin to see you in a different light. :)
1Ayb4UK7aa	He wanted a cheap feel and the fact that you didn't stop him lets him know he can do whatever he wants with you.  Have you no shame or dignity?  At 14, neither of you know what you are doing in that area.|`|6e541cf93eb873a02de583d69ccab728aa	U shouldn't let him do that again because u seem like u r on the verge of letting him do ''other'' things to you which is normal to feel curious at your age but there are a lot of diseases out there and you could become pregnant.

(what a surprise? duh)|`|8TDnfCkaaa	I'd hold off on letting him know it was okay and making him do it again. I'd give it some time, enough time for all the other boys/girls he's probably told he had his hand up your skirt, and whatever else he may have made up and added to the situation. I think you should tell him he was out of line, and that you're not ready for that sort of thing yet. Otherwise, if you don't like this answer, maybe you should ask your mom or dad and see what they suggest.|`|uRDdtM56aa	haha i have guys friends that are relatively new within the last three to four months, and even some within the last one to two months that i have become friends with. they have done everything from rubbing my leg to putting their hands almost up my skirt, to grabbing my butt or waist. but they also give me hugs and kisses on the cheek and stuff. and i always act insulted and make them move their hands. i never really take it to mean anything... and i am used to it by now...<br>  <br>  unless you think that them doing something like that would signify some type of likeness for the girl? idk....|`|nEkWPA9Aaa	hehee i guess he is a tease<br>  maybe you should just hang out again<br>  and like look hiim straight in the eyes<br>  be a little flirtish and like<br>  dont play hard to get<br>  <br>  at least you have known him for quite a while now<br>  lol<br>  but yeah or you can just<br>  use direct approach<br>  just ask him|`|5LZ6ujMfaa	That was so disrespectful!

Start it out as normal as you and her normally do and then ask her. It would be easier for the both of you. Trust me!

You seem to invite these things on yourself. Keep in mind, there is a time and place for almost everything. Voicing your opinion at an inopportune time can come across like challenging the teacher. When a teacher is correcting someone and you invite yourself into the verbal discipline, you are going to get reprimanded even-tho' you think you were correct. There is an old adage that says "It is better to keep your mouth closed and let others think you are a fool than open it and confirm their beliefs.r
a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	I have found that with CONTROLLING people, they are never going to be happy as long as someone who is the object of their aggressive authority is around them. You have to be the giver in this relationship by generously being friendly and positive to her. It takes two fighting sides to have an argument. So don't argue with her. It is not a position of weakness. It is a position of strength and it will soothe your relationship. Being calm and content in your own life and accomplishments and not flaunting or even seeking approval from her about it will also help improve the relationship. Be kind and go home as needed, but don't feel you need to overdue it. Although she is overcontrolling, she is also dependent upon you, too. Peace.|`|8AElGHFuaa	mums are all like that i think its because she misses you and fells like your growing up to fast  she still probably thinks that your her little baby <br>   and maybe she just wants more time with you  try sending al lot of time with her. have fun  with her. help her when she needs it  don't ask if you could go to your boyfriends  because she probably fells kinda of  jealous that he always with you and your not with her .|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Do you know much about how she was raised?  Maybe her family life was like that and her expectations are more or less the expectations placed on her as a girl.  The boyfriend staying over is still her call as it is her house and she is obviously not comfortable with that.   Chances are you will never be as helpful around the house as she would like, but at least you keep trying.  Maybe one thing that might help is not arguing about these things.  If she starts, let her tell you what and listen to why, then tell her that you love and respect her and have listened to what she said, but it is your life and your choice and your consequences.  Say that you are not going to argue about it because you love her and it is your decision to make.  Politely as possible end conversations that head towards an argument, if you can (might be hard, but worth a try).  Maybe also ask her about what she has been up to, for advice about appropriate things (not problem topics) and about what she did when she was your age, tell her about your achievements at uni etc.  Maybe you can make conversations about more pleasant things as well as cutting them off when they turn towards an argument.  Good luck.|`|toHCAW6taa	Its a shame really, she pushing you away even if she does not realise that.  Before things get so bad that you fall out it may be worth you finding a little flat of your own, this will be your own and your space where your mum cannot take over unless you let her.  I know places are pricey at the moment  I wonder how far and how much does your boyfriend pay to travel? meet half way and stay in a nice little guest house somewhere look at it as a little get away?  If you are both really serious with each other get someone to live together to share the costs.  Your mum has to realise what she is doing, I am a mum as well and I would hate to think my sons thought I was smothering them.  Good luck with what ever you choose to do|`|wlqUMBZbaa	You can fight without ever winning, but you will never ever win without a fight!<br>  <br>  Decide what you will tolerate and what you won't<br>  Tell your mother this, and let her know the consequences of her actions if she decides to cross the line you have set.<br>  <br>  None of this will work unless you have the determination and courage to follow through, but if you do - you mark my words, your mum will rant and shout and threaten, but when she sees that you are serious, she'll crumble and cry!<br>  <br>  Let us all know how you get on!|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Are your mom and dad together?  If not does she hate him and do you look like him?  Doesn't seem like you can do anything right as far as she is concerned unless you do it her way.  You are away and living on your own or is she still responsible for your bills while you are at school?  If she is paying for you then she feels that she still is in control. But if you are taking care of yourself then you have to find a respectful way to let your mother know that you are handling your own. <br>  She can't really do anything about you allowing your boyfriend to stay in your room but you know she does not approve.  She can however do something about it when you come home because he lives next door. After all it's right in her face.  So you do without the closeness of boyfriend while you are home.  It won't kill you or him. You know you'll be back together once you go back to school.
llT8Prtiaa	Em,<br>  If a guy is interested in you he will be interested in anything you have to say.  Keep your legs closed and your mind open.  What are your favorite movies, sports, best friends, are you in school, and most important, don't be afraid to talk to him about your future plans and goals.  maybe you are looking for a serious relationship and he isn't.  If he isn't move on.  You can't change him. <br>  When I met my now husband, no matter how much he pushed the issue of marriage, the first date.  I was determined to remain true to my plan of being his friend first.  14 yrs later we are still best of friends.  We had nothing in common when we first met.  I was amazed and sometimes in awe of his life story, his sports (football) background,  and he was impressed with my alturistic lifestyle, and admired me for it.  We were two totally differnt people.  Everyone bet against our relationship.  Most of them have separated, divorced or admitted how happy and in love we are.<br>  Be yourself.  If you are a talker, talk.  Not everyone has the gift of gab.  My husband does.  I did not.  Althought I do not have a problem speaking my mind.<br>  If you are not much of a talker just sit back relax and enjoy the quiet or the sound of his voice.<br>  Cheers!

TGRVPAt9aa	He could've realized something, that you didn't realize. He could, for example, realize that he likes you, and now that he realized that, he feels awkward around you.<br>  <br>  It's most likely something you missed. Maybe a person went up to him and told him that the way you act with him is weird. (Hey, it happens - doubt it, though, because the way you two greet each other is sweet. I don't have anyone like that).|`|EcmQQecBaa	Maybe he likes you, and he just feels awkward speaking to you know because he doesn't know what to say..|`|N84TSasaaa	i need some more stuff has any thing changed for you or him like did you get a boy Friend or something like that |`|Z0lbrnHpaa	maybe there's something he's going through at home. in order to find out, just ask him. communication is key:)|`|9Vn1nJU6aa	I had a guy friend who called me every night to talk, but all of the sudden he stopped and never said or lookd at me ever again at school T____T" <br>  <br>  I think either i did something wrong or he likes a friend of mine.<br>  Did you do anything that might've offended him?

He might have had a thing for you and you didn't notice so he's a little hurt.<br>  <br>  2.) He might have something going on in his personal life that is affecting the way he interacts with his friends.<br>  <br>  3.) He might be playing hard to get and is trying to get you to pursue him more readily.<br>  <br>  4.) He just wants to move on for whatever reason.  Maybe he just needs some space right now.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you just be open with him.  Tell him that you've noticed his rather closed off behavior and that whatever's up, you're there for him. You can ask him directly what's wrong, but don't pry too much.  You don't want him to feel smothered.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps...best of luck!|`|E2OKRhwYaa	Maybe he likes you or something in his personal life is affecting the way he's acting with people.

qOo8QdSzaa	Yep, it can be done if the mom and step-dad are agreeable.  Only thing dad has to do is sign away his parental rights to the child or children which means no more contact of any type because he's releasing his parental rights.  In essence he's no longer responsible for the child or children.  One issue I see is whose going to pay for the adoption?  It might be that's exactly what mom and step-dad want to happen so it isn't going to be a problem or be addressed.  Big concern I have is how old is the child or children involved?  It most likely will be upsetting to them and they may view the situation as daddy didn't want me which would cause emotional and mental problems for them.  Dad needs to think about what's in the best interest of the child/children.  |`|1HTRWrawaa	Any man can agree to allow his ex-wife's husband adopt his child. If the wife and her husband want to do this, then I would just bring the subject up during mediation and ask what steps you need to take to make it happen.<br>  <br>  You may not want to talk now about whether or not this is the right thing to do, but I guarantee you that when that child grows up she/he is going to look you up and demand to know why you disowned them. You can only put off talking about this for so long.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, any man who would give up his own child, doesn't deserve to be that child's father and that child would be better off with him not being in his/her life. But I'm thinking like an adult and a child will think there must be something wrong with them that their own father couldn't love them and wanted nothing to do with them.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your freedom. I'm a firm believer in good and bad karma and what goes around, comes around.
lbX75d1xaa	You should talk with her - have a series of meetings over coffee or walks or whatever - so you can get a full explanation of why she did what she did, and you can tell her how you felt about it.  Don't get into emotionally vulnerable situations like having drinks or getting in bed.  Wait til you have talked it out and then talked it some more until you are both sick of talking about it but you feel like you really got it now...  and you should tell her in advance that you are seeking information and that may seem cold but you are using her for that right now, you want to know what happened and you aren't going to be satisfied with some simple words, and if she thinks she will get sick of that then she best leave you alone now because that's why you are talking to her now.  And let her know you will continue to see your new friends and date the people you've been dating because you changed when things changed, and you cannot be hinged back and forth.<br>  <br>  After all that happens - will take quite some time - you will be in a really good place to make a decision on where to go. <br>  <br>  And the promise ring business after 6 months or less - don't even really know what that is technically, but sounds like you may be apt to move too quickly - dating for about 2 years is good before making a commitment like that, at your age.|`|hyUqNihaaa	You should talk to her and ask her what's happening|`|8bISKi4maa	girls are girls, just appease her|`|M0tOXOSnaa	sorry but either she's crazy or a little slow:p if i were you, i'd ask her long time ago why she felt so upset? because to me, it sounds like you both spent a pretty good time while in your relationship:) so don't keep resentment, i think it's okay to respond to her, just don't get too caught up. maybe it's time for you to keep on with your life as a single person, like you've had since then. now, that she sees how okay you are without her and ready to try new relationships, she realizes how she acted and what she lost. simply stay real, true to yourself. you'll feel when things aren't going good for you.

e47af0o6aa	u need to sit down and talk to him man to man. Fathers are really really really protective over there doughters. The same thing happened with me and my bf we were in his car at the park and my dad was driveing by and saw his car and pulled over to c if we had a flat er somethin and we were doin it and he flipped **** and wouldnt let me c him. So he came over 2 days later and sat down with my dad and told him he was srry and that he luved me and that he respects me. So my dad said he couldnt stop us from luving eachother and let me c him again<br>  <br>  so try telling her dad that tell him u luv his daughter only if u really do and mayby that wil work cause u cant stop 2 people from luving eachother|`|nXJTGLzQaa	I'm not sure this is covered in Emily Post.  I would say that the letter was sufficient.  I think it's unlikely her father will ever be satisfied by any apology or discussion.  In any future meetings with him, be polite and show yourself to be a gentleman to his daughter.  He may forgive you one day, but he may always hold it against you.  One more thing, make sure you don't get caught again.|`|S1Hr7CNyaa	OMG, of course he is pissed and concerned.<br>  <br>  Well, I had custody of my brother when he was a teenager, and we went through a situation like this.<br>  <br>  Afterward, I went over and apologized to the girl's dad, assuring him that my brother would not do such a thing in the future (it was in THEIR house, ughhh).<br>  <br>  The Dad was obviously fighting back tears during the whole conversation.  I just kept telling him how sorry we were.  My brother even apologized to him, but of course it did very little good.<br>  <br>  YES, he is expecting a sincere apology from you.  NO, it probably will not do much good, but it's the right thing.  <br>  <br>  Just look him right in the eye - tell him you know it was wrong, that you would give anything to take it back, and that you are so very sorry. Make sure you accept 100% of the blame, even though she was a willing participant.  Tell him you will stay away from his daughter if that is their wish.<br>  <br>  Step back and let their family work it out.  And, FTLOG, learn from this and control yourself in the future.  I am hoping this wasn't in their house, also.<br>  <br>  I know you'll be glad when this is over.  I'm sorry and kudos on being a man and doing the right thing.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll be glad when it's over!~  Good luck...|`|5axWdjiraa	Usually fathers are really protective of their daughters. They do not like it if some guy screws their daughter. Maybe having a manly mature chat with him would be ideal. Just to sort things out and hopefully he won't be peed off about it.<br>  <br>  I don't get why the father needs to take her to a virginity meeting because she ain't exactly a virgin is she because of you.|`|RT00Lzwuaa	try being responsible and sit down her dad and tell him that you know why he is angry and look him in the eye and just  tell him how much you love her (if you do,  idk) and just be honest|`|am6HMPgEaa	u should have sex with her again and have sex with him too|`|5M3UHOQSaa	Your ******, everytime he sees your face he's gona think of you plowing his little girl.

tvav5UcUaa	Well, it depends on what the emails say.<br>  It does feel kind of crappy when your boyfriend won't do anything about it. I know what its like from her point of view and if you won't at least talk to the guy to tell him to back off, it kind of hurts but that does not mean you don't love her. The fact that you want to make your relationship work is good enough but if she is not satisfied, make her happy if you think she is worth it. Don't kick the guys ***, just let him know that you do not like what he is doing. Show him that she has moved on but if he continues, it may be her that hasn't let go. No offense but I mostly agree with you. I think she id going over the top by saying you don't love her. When I went through that, I thought he didn't care but he does. Prove to her that you love her.<br>  Sorry if my response is confusing. I can relate to both sides.|`|RQenZnjmaa	Okay, I've actually had this happen to me. I have an abusive ex and he found me somehow. My fiance found out about the guy's e-mails and he wanted to do something about it, but not attack the guy. He's thinking along the same lines at you: make 'us' work and throw it in his face or something else. I'd try to explain things to her, but if she's hellbent on you confronting him, I don't know what to say. Don't do it though, it could lead to serious legal problems on your part. ~ace~
QpFLIGKNaa	well, if they are taking a break, they are most likely to break up, and when they take a break, that meens they are trying some one new to like, date, and ya, so i think he was trying your attitude out, and things like that, so he must like you!|`|4NQqiOyiaa	The truth is...if you ask him out right now or start messing around with him...you will most likely be just a rebound if he responds.

You might have had a blast when you were together but to him it was probably a friendly outing. Right now he needs someone to be with so that he can  get over his ex girl friend, which is you. He might just be taking you as friend who his hanging out with.  I would not advice you to do anything with him because you will end up getting hurt.He likes you as a friend .

y1wS0MYGaa	awww i'm sorry.  :(<br>  <br>  honestly you're probably just out of the honey moon phase of the relationship.  don't be obsessive - that's not healthy.  it's probably best that you two don't see each other as often as you did before for a little while to let the spark build back up.  trust me, i kept pushing my old boyfriend to keep hanging out all the time and it made things worse.  tell her how you're feeling, and remember - sometimes absence makes the heart grow fonder.<br>  <br>  best of luck, you sound like one of the few good guys left out there that are really committed a girl.  she should realize that and appreciate that, and if she doesn't, trust me, you'll find a woman one day that realizes how much of a catch you are.|`|AA11161235	You (and much less people on Y!A) cannot make your girl crazy about you|`|cDbVzLv8aa	best thing to do mate is ask her how she feels for you and if she thinks you relationship is going anywhere.<br>  <br>  or the other option<br>  <br>  say to her look this s hit isnt happening i feel you respect your mates motre than me and your giving me a bum deal where do i stand<br>  <br>  basically she will either tell you its over or **** herself that you feel the way you do and she gets worried your going to dump her but my advice would be ask good luck 
MKmj96hUaa	What Dreams May Come is my personal favourite, but it is very sad and scary in parts. Robin Williams dies and goes to Heaven. When he learns that his wife (Annabelle Sciorra) has died and gone to hell, he descends to the underworld in an effort to rescue her. Also stars Cuba Gooding Jr and Max von Sydow.<br>  <br>  Till Human Voices Wake Us is an Australian film. A tragic romance, it stars Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter. Try to get the International cut as it is (in my view) much better than the Australian Cut.<br>  <br>  Then there's also:<br>  <br>  Amelie - French with subtitles but absolutely superb!<br>  <br>  Betty Blue - also French with subtitles<br>  <br>  Captain Corelli's Mandolin<br>  <br>  Just Like Heaven<br>  <br>  Love Story (an old one but a good one)<br>  <br>  As for what to eat: strawberries, cherries and freshly sliced mangoes cut into large slivers with a dipping bowl of cream and some slightly warmed, slightly watered down honey to dunk (try it before you judge it) And don't feed yourselves: let your partner and yourself feed each other. That way, even Hannibal could become a romantic movie...<br>  <br>  By the way, not all men hate romances. I'm living proof of that.|`|fc214e893ee228e7fbbd1cc1b0a7d069aa	Shakespeare in love.

Apologize, and send her flowers or something...they have a certain type that mean im sorry, i think its the Peach colored roses. Try those. Did you even have any reason to say those mean things?

My boyfriend did the same thing to me (except he sent his friend to tell me...) and it really hurt mostly because it is to a girl saying that you don't think that she is worth talking to and try to work out a problem. <br>  The best thing you can do is just pull her aside or ask her to meet you somewhere, and just speak from the heart. This will come off a lot more sincere than something you plan and read like a script.Also tell that the big thing is that you hurt her and do really care, but don't be all like "lets get back together now!" kinda thing. Consider her feelings more than your own and if she knows your heart, you should not have anymore problems.But  you need to realize that because you made this mistake you are going to need to put her first.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind the only person you need to prove yourself to is her.|`|PukfhDWnaa	Yeah, we all do things like this  at times.  Tell her she means so much to you and you are sorry for over reacting and that you should have approached her in a more gentle way.  Tell her to please forgive you and give you another chance.  If she does not, then the relationship does not mean that much to her, but if she really cares for you, she will forgive.  If she does not forgive, remember, this is her personailty and do you really want to live forever with someone so unforgiving??  Bate your hook again and cast it to sea.  There are other fish.|`|hcrihuxvaa	It seems like you make quick decisions on a whim. A relationship is serious business. A simple apology sometimes won't work. Show your girl that you are serious. Give her something sentimental and original, not just flowers and candy. |`|XmS6XsrGaa	Just tell how how you feel and say that you breaking up with her was the biggest mistake of your life and hopefully shell see the luv in your eyes and how much u mean it and she'll take you back. good luck :)|`|B5IeqWRYaa	leave her in peace. Wether ur attracted to her or not, the reasons you broke up with her probably still exist. If you get back with her she'll be dragged through crap, until you break up with her again.|`|B7sDJvZLaa	why did u do that anyways??????????jus keep talkin 2 her tell her how sorry u are show her how much u love her.. gud luk man!!|`|1en1Jtp4aa	CASH is making a BOLD statement!! And that's the only way.|`|0uDcjtuLaa	the first answer, and buy her flowers.|`|el0zTNtiaa	Well the fact that you said meanful things to her, does put you in an awkward position, you can not much blame her for being that way, maybe the best way to apologize is to talk to her face to face, instead of the telephone or internet, that way she can she you reactions, don't expect her to be cheerful to quick, and it is going to take some time to repair what happened, it is going to be up to her if she takes you back. It would be best to think about what you are going to say and be smart about it and don't act ignorant in you conversation to her. It will not make it any better if you do that|`|XqKVSzL5aa	Well, go to her house. Tell her parents, friends, etc. That you were very sorry (It might be hard). And tell them you love her a lot and was very sorry about what you did. Tell them to please forget about the pass, and you want to start over again. Tell them you won't leave the house until they forgive.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|ycda0pNeaa	Tell her that you like her and you are really sorry that you did all those mean things to her.  After you  apoligize to her tell her you want to get back together.
1rmSuG2Haa	LOL ~ Here's the secret how to make ANY woman your friend:<br>  <br>  Act like you DON'T want to be friends with them. Ignore them and/or tease them, etc.<br>  <br>  Reverse psychology works honey. It works like a damn charm every time. =)|`|lUv0MRD9aa	give her space.<br>  really. don't insist you still love her and you can't bear to be w/o her. i've had someone try to pressure me into changing my mind about a break-up before and that massively irritated me.<br>  but if you're still enthusiastic about a friendship then just act like a friend would.<br>  maybe her whole point about not wasting time on you just applies to a bf/gf relationship.<br>  talk to her every once and a while. maybe don't call her. IM her... but do "friendship" things after a while. she'll know you just don't want to lose her companionship if you're too buddy-buddy RIGHT away.|`|e1Ki8JK6aa	that's practically the exact same case with me. =/<br>  except i don't feel like wasting my time on him anymore either..<br>  <br>  <br>  but anyway, just give her her space.<br>  don't TRY to talk to her.<br>  right now she's trying to show you that she's better than you, and you need to do the same.<br>  once you start ignoring her, she should start craving your attention.<br>  it's really hard to do, but just try, and things should work out.<br>  <br>  |`|lCc7Blg6aa	You don't want to be friends with her. Trust me.<br>  It'll only make things harder for you.<br>  Having to see her every day, and know you can't have her while she walks all over you.<br>  I went through EXACTLY the same thing with my ex. Then one day i just got plain old mad, and realized he wasn't the good guy i fell in love with, he'd become an arrogant twat. <br>  Just try to keep your self occupied and not think about her. <br>  Things will get better.<br>  I promise :)|`|PTxaUkwKaa	Please just get over her. She don't want you no more. There are other girls out there. You are only torturing yourself.|`|bcT3anmxaa	Trust me, you will find a better girl who is good to you. Give it time. Don't waste your time on her|`|K0eqMHveaa	oh lawd! i complety understand yew. what yew should do is act like yew dont like her anymore and back up a little bit. but not all the way. when she has problems, you should comfort her and really listen to her and be there for her. shell remember yew forever for that. trust me i kno! if that dont work then shes the piece of **** and dont realize how good she got it. then yew should just forget her =D|`|TOx9OqOwaa	She basically called you a waste of her time... have some huevos, and don't waste time with her that you could be spending on someone who actually enjoys your company. Besides she might cramp your style, and your obviously cramping hers.|`|PaWYyjaWaa	That's tough. As a girl, I have been in her position before. There is nothing you can do if she doesn't want you any more. Get over her.|`|dee0a38a3e3de19888ff6398150a975faa	Next time she says that quit being a wus and tell her that talking like that is NEVER going to win you back.  Then at least you're not acting like a wussy douchebag in her eyes.|`|AtcJZ8Xuaa	someone whos enough of a jerk that they dont even want to be your friend isnt worth your time. just let it go dude. the sooner you stop thinking about her, the sooner you meet somebody better.|`|AA10243163	You don't want to be friends with her, you want to get back together, so quit hurting yourself by trying, and just move on!|`|pJAR4scnaa	Maddie says: okay dude. you sorta like need ot move on. if you really like her, you'll give her some space and maybe she'll change her mind.|`|JPyo2M9gaa	give her some space. <br>  then she will realize that she needs.|`|oheA2Xrmaa	moooooooooooooooooooovvvvvvveeeeeeee<br>  on

But what good is worrying about it going to do? Its just going to make things akward so call him and make a joke about it be like oh yea feeding me tacos before i pole dance good idea. Itll make it less akward, and you can both laugh about it. Everyone embarasses themselves sometimes.|`|m3xKmRMQaa	HAHAHAH,<br>  sorry but thats hillarious.<br>  if i were you, i'd say i was to drunk to remember, and completely act like i didnt know what happend.

It sounds as though your husband has some serious control issues.<br>  Shoving your marriage license in your face, yelling and then leaving makes him sound like he has no self control and anger issues. <br>  It's not up to you to forgive him unless you believe that it won't happen again. He sounds like he's ready to explode and I hope you can move really fast if he does.

You are going to have to discuss this with him and ask about his true feelings regarding what he said.  The things he said are not the types of things any self respecting American woman would tolerate in the modern day nor should.  I'm not saying you should up and leave, but you and he are going to have to discuss it in depth and he's going to have to understand your true needs and expectations of him!|`|Ux0co0Dsaa	he called you a b*** and said he "owned you"...2 statements I wouldn't exactly "get over".<br>  <br>  VERY unhealthy and absolutely a sign of more trouble ahead.|`|v4Y5zQIuaa	God counts the tears of women.

I own you? Hmmmph. He'd be eating those papers if that were me! <br>  <br>  He's got what marriage is about all twisted and confused. Yes, biblically speaking a wife is to obey her husband, HOWEVER, the husband need not act like a dictator and try to rule over the wife. <br>  <br>  Your husband is being verbally and emotionally abusive. Let him know upfront that you will not tolerate being talked to like that. If you don't, he'll think that he can keep on treating you like that. And he called you out your name??!!!! Woooooooo sahhhhhhhhhh.|`|g9wHFWOeaa	Ok, this guy has major issues. If he said that, I would seriously consider leaving him . . . . "I own you" is just the start. He will end up hitting you later if you stay.<br>  <br>  Get out now.<br>  <br>  *** MILDRED SENT ME***|`|t5EE6WO8aa	you are not being petty, that would bother me as well. just because you married him does not mean he owns you. he should not be saying that to you or call you a b*tch. you should be able to talk to him about it as much as you need to until you feel ok about it. if he doesn't listen or gets defensive about it, that's just because he knows he was wrong and just won't admit it. to me that's close to a deal breaker, i mean me and my husband joke around calling each other names but we never mean it and he'd never say it in the heat of an argument like that. try and talk to him about it and if he doesn't want to listen, talk to a counselor, go on your own just to get your feelings out and get the help you need to guide you through it.

Depending on what you really want to do, there's different scenarios that you can try. However, the best way to approach it would just be to talk about it, that should keep him comfortable and I think you'll see the best results. Just say that you want to "take you relationship to the next level, and part of that is getting more physical and having more fun. I understand if you don't want to but I think it'd be really good for us."...<br>  hope that helps and goood luck!|`|dcbafba855831d2e40b844843ac7dc35aa	well just let him know how you feel about it and that you have needs. tell him the truth that you aint going to wait till marriage. so he could know whats up.

Tal vez un par de consultas de pareja te pueda ayudar.<br>  Lo lamento mucho.|`|H3m8wvXnaa	el fallo es que muchas veces somos egoístas buscando solo lo que nos gusta, queremos que alguien nos hace feliz y cuando no somos feliz es la culpa de otro.<br>  en el segundo lugar miramos la situación y no "tomamos el toro de cuernos" no hablamos con la persona en causa para decir como son las cosas para saber su opinión, porque actúa de esta forma. y si tu estabas en su lugar como actuabas.<br>  <br>  la separación es una rotura y nada se rompe sin dolor.<br>  <br>  piensa bien y actúa correctamente.|`|y1tYwlhKaa	Pues si en realidad odias la situación, simplemente dile que ya no puedes con eso, y q es mejor que se separen, y por el bien de su hija, tratar de llevar una relación armoniosa, y la verdad no creo q sea buena idea irte de vacaciones....no tiene caso si al regresar volverán con lo mismo....para que prolongar lo definitivo, a menos que en el fondo realmente no quieres hacerlo, y creas que todo se puede solucionar, y si es así , si en realidad tienes esperanzas de salvar la relación platiquenlo, expongan lo bueno y lo malo de la relación y se darán cuenta si tiene caso continuar o no, y si ya no hay remedio, es mejor que sea pronto, así te evitaras mas confrontaciones y muchos problemas.....Suerte|`|W6hILcyXaa	simple y sencillo :) solo sigue estos pasos:                                        1.- extiende el brazo derecho con la mano abierta y que la palma apunte hacia arriba.<br>  2.- cierra la mano y formarás un pu?o( manten el brazo de la poscicion 1)<br>  3.- la mano izquierda ponla en el brazo derecho de donde se dobla ( por arriba)<br>  4.-dobla el brazo derecho y simple :D<br>  <br>  espero t halla ayudado :D|`|5LLFTapwaa	Ve de frente y dìcelo de una buena vez no prolongues esto mas en el tiempo|`|kDZIT70Raa	yo que tu iba con un sicologo de parejas le das tu veredicto ,  y despues lo citas ahi y entre los dos se lo dicen ,..|`|aa0880328c6f531b9e9318fa380e088baa	De cualquier forma una confrontación es dolorosa, tienes que ser directa y rápida, no darle más vueltas al asunto, tu solo en tu papel si exaltarte y con voz tranquila pero fuerte di lo que tengas que decir.|`|V31aJaUGaa	Se nota que el esta tratando de salvar la relacion, una pareja se puede pelear mucho pero no significa que eso sea motivo de separacion...<br>  Cuales son tus motivos  reales para dejarlo? Las peleas? Yo cuando discuto con mi marido trato de pensar realmente en el porque. <br>  Lei que decias "necesito descansar". No es facil ser esposa, mama y  trabajadora, puede que otros factores (animicos por ejemplo) produzcan esas peleas que tenes con tu marido. Hace cuanto que pelean?<br>  <br>  Mejor intenta hablarlo con el una vez mas durante esas vacaciones, pero esta vez controlandote sin enojarte (aunque el pueda ponerse mal). Que seas vos quien lleve el hilo de la conversacion. <br>  Cuando uno pierde el control ya no sirve de nada abrir la boca, mejor aclarar la mente(que se nubla por la bronca) y pensar como resolver las cosas. <br>  Si te estare pidiendo mucho ,pero hacelo por tu hija, y por lo que te unio a tu marido. Preguntate a vos misma(cuando estes calmada) si realmente es necesario separarte del papa de tu nena.

F0rbWQL8aa	When you see him just say something simple like, "hey, how are you?"

Be subtle and flirty. You don't even have to think of it as making a move. Just hang out as friends or hold his eye contact when in a room of people without speaking.

Just make a small move. Say something like "I'd date a guy like you if I had a chance."|`|t8xMwzjHaa	Flirt back, or flirt with his friends around him. Maybe he'll realize he could lose you, then he'll make a move.|`|RnbGXovQaa	just wait and see what happens then if you dont wanna make the first move|`|QbAIppQsaa	Well if you don't want to make the first move then you don't need anyone to answer your question. Say hi. If he is in one of your classes then ask him if you can use his notes. You snooze you loose, someone else might like him and make the first move on him and take him away from your scaredness.|`|f5vkUoPOaa	Flirt with him too and try to start conversation, the more he gets to know about you the more he is likely to make the first move, good luck :)|`|k8Xtqcc5aa	i am not going to tell you what to do but just remember nothing will happen if you just sit there =]]

Si no mejora hazle una segunda llamada y asi hasta que entienda. Tambien recuerda que el trabajo es importante y que a veces hay que dedicarle mas tiempo. Si de plano se vuelve una rutina y ya es insoportable para ti, lo mejor es sugerirle la separacion hasta qie aprenda a dedicarte tiempo.

Ls93X4ufaa	Lot's of people are happily married and Bi-sexual. If these are his needs, you either go with them, or you don't, his needs will remain the same. Sex sometimes had nothing to do with love, even if you are married. If he's sneaking around having sex with men, that's a whole other matter.

If he married you then you satisfy his needs, this seems like something you need to talk about, express your concerns and worries and see what comes out of it. Don't be another divorce statistic just because you're uncomfortable, and be together because you do love one another, that's what is really important! Talk about everything first, don't rush it.|`|zTq0NSGUaa	Maybe he needs some sexual amusement.  If you still love each other, maybe this is a bump in the road.  You should ask what needs to be done to stay with each other.  Maybe try a threesome with a male since he looks at other male pics.  You don't have to break up, just work at it first.  He might be bisexual or curious and want to try it.  <br>  <br>  Just work it out first, worst case is Divorce.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	male pics as in hes bi? yea id leave this isnt a college bf or something where you might be up to trying different things. this is a marriage and you feeling like youre not enough for him will only make you unhappy about other things in your life as well. if you werent what he wanted he shouldnt have married you. i know you love him but you should love yourself more and worry about what you need, which is a man that wants only you emotionally and physically.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	WOOOOW....hes a lil bi-curious are something isnt he?? he defiantly doesnt need to be married untill he gets his sexuality together|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	He will be coming out of the closet sooner or later.

Is he getting side action from a man??? I would ask him.|`|FU4TyghIaa	you do love one another.<br>  you don't mention any kids, that would balance the scales i suppose if there were, but it doesn't appear.<br>  <br>  I tell ya, i'm a guy, so from my perspective i can give how i am, and your guy is not me so it's not the same, but maybe it is similar, so i don't know for sure.  But anyway, in case you're interested, it might help you work out what is going on or at least entertain the possibility.  I hope it helps anyway, given that you love each other, and love is a very precious thing, and so;<br>  <br>  i've looked at male pornography myself.  I've even fantasized or wondered or thought about it with no real problem.<br>  But then, after having those thoughts and later just talking to a man, you know some guy who's not rough or butch, well kept i'll say, i find myself thinking back to those fantasy thoughts.<br>  And even though the guy might be alright on the eye, when i think or try to think of being 'with' him, it totally clashes with what i would want in any intimacy.  I couldn't be in love i could feel wanted or comfortable or even just getting down and dirty with this guy before me.  I feel quite ill at the consideration.  I like women, their softness their hair, their, no none of that particularly, i just like women, i'm hetero through and through.<br>  <br>  and yet in spite of that, i still look at men in porno on occasion and even fantasize.    <br>  you know, i look at women in porno sometimes and it's just wild male sex drive or something.  I don't want to have sex with those women i just look at them.  same thing for men, with women and with other men.  i just look.<br>  <br>  and i struggle with my conscience, cause i feel like the people in these things might be being taken advantage of, and by watching it, even if i download it for free, i'm still facillitating that.  That's why you can't watch child porn, even if it's chicks who are like 17yo.  You can't watch that stuff, it's plain wrong.  But with adults, it's probably okay, but then i don't know.<br>  <br>  All the same, the thing is, it's part of men's sex, well mine at least.  I masturbate in the shower right.  And that's like sex stuff and i want to do it.  But hell, it's nothing like being with my girlfriend.  It doesn't compare it just, no way does it detract from my interaction with her.  And even i figured about male porno for me.  It's almost like watching that, i'm fantasizing that it's a man pleasuring another man, i'm relating to that man and making me be doing what my girlfriend does to me.  Cause it's a man doing it, i can relate to him, and then i pretend i'm doing what my girl does to me.  Complicated thought, but that's what i think drives me to watch male porno.  I don't understand my own thoughts for sure and i don't know about your guy in the least.<br>  <br>  But look, seeing as you love each other, and you don't know for sure that it is actually unfaithful or disrespecting his feelings for you.  I'm thinking that you don't want anything to do with this male porn or even to know it exists?  You could just tell him that, tell him you love him all the same but you don't want to know about it.<br>  <br>  But then you might want to keep an eye on what he's doing in case he does cross the line and contact real guys?<br>  <br>  It's really difficult for you, i understand entirely and all this trust and stuff comes out into it.  <br>  <br>  Should he have a private life from you, a part that you don't know?  And a part like this, where he fulfills some sexual stuff without you?

Your happiness does not include this behavior--no law says you have to tolerate this stuff.

6Wdl6UFdaa	Chances are you are more then pretty, you are probably gorgeous, this does change things alot. There are two scenarios, and it depends on how old you and the group of guys are. If your still young (elementary school) then yes, they all like you, but you intimidate them because of the fact that you are pretty, so none of them approach you. This could be the case for seniors too (highschool). In other words, they are all scared of the fact that theyll get shot down if they approach you and be ridiculed by their friends. Either 1 of them like you, and his friends are teasing that one guy, or they all like you, and are all chickens. A crueler way to think of this however, one scenario that can't be eliminated, is that they think of you as a challenge, and they're pressuring one of their fellow friends to ask you out as a dare, and see how far that takes them. Good luck.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	they are not making fun of you , they like you , maybe they want to see who will get to ask you out first. anyway , if you fell uncomfortable about it , walk up to them and say hi guys whats up . one is blown to talk.|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	Their PIGS!!!!!<br>  <br>  They are probably afraid of what you might say to them!|`|FoNZKlHxaa	if you really want to mknow ask them what? or can i help you> their probably just thinking your hot|`|rak8dIh4aa	its one thing to look at a girl and think she is cute. its another thing to be interested in her as far as having a relationship goes. dating or casual.<br>  <br>  are u sure ur not staring at them? lol. maybe they're like, "why's that chick starin us down? does she like one of us? why don't she just say something?!?"|`|cX19V2e4aa	LOL...Noo trust me it isnt you..its just the boys..thats how they act.. dont let it bother you or get  to you..guys are just stupid like that...and we (girls) put to much thought into stuff like that sometimes and half of the time they dont really care..but anyways..just keep doing what your doing and ignore them.. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WKkp0lX7aa	because guys are stupid =]|`|2tn8EALqaa	can't read their minds, sorry|`|UY4P6UFxaa	just checking you out or something admiring your beauty maybe? :)

AA12361568	I don't think it's too early to renew your vows. My husband and I are actually thinking of doing the same thing for our 5th year anniversary which will be coming up soon. Our wedding was small, and I just didn't like the way it turned out. So even though we'll have only been married 5 years we plan on doing a "re-do" then, lol. The same as you, I don't want to wait for the 10 year. I want it while we're young and will look pretty in all the pictures! lol. And our kids would really enjoy it also (ages 4 and 1 1/2). So I say, go for it! =)|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	Renewing Vows, as far as I've read, you could have it as a second wedding as a religious or legal marriage, or just to remind each other that you love each other and your children.

If I were you I'd try other things first and consider a vow renewal an absolute last-ditch remedy to your very real and very important problem.<br>  <br>  Vow renewals aren't traditional, but for the very short period of time they've been around they've either taken place after a long period of married bliss or after a short period of married non-bliss - after events like a life-threatening illness, deployment, infidelity, infertility, or substance abuse problems. That's why people tend to assume that any vow renewal that takes place so soon after a wedding must have followed some kind of personal tragedy the bride and groom have kept silent about. Tongues wag and they wag hard, no matter how much the couple attempts to explain. You have to decide whether you can handle this.<br>  <br>  It may also be seen by others as a waste of money to spend thousands of dollars on a vow renewal at a time when people are losing their homes and their jobs, especially if any of your friends or family are in that situation. They may even be hurt or resentful that you spent money on yourselves instead of helping them or donating to charity, or may see you as - and I don't believe this myself, but I have to put it out there - not too smart.<br>  <br>  From the people I've spoken with who have been in your exact circumstance, their vow renewals have been fun but haven't done a thing to take away the sadness about the original wedding. I wish they had, because the only other thing that seems to help is counselling, and that's not cheap either (but a lot cheaper than a renewal). Apparently the counselling helped them to realize that society overstates the importance of the wedding, especially to women who are taught from infancy that their wedding will be the "most important day of their lives", and that putting the wedding in proper perspective can make things easier, given time and work.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. What it means is that you should go into it with your eyes open, realizing that some of your friends and family won't understand why you're doing it and may be angry that you're spending the money, and realizing that it may not give you the result you want.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Then, when the conversation is over, just get to know their name, and tell them yours. Hang out with this friend often and make more. <br>  <br>  These friends will like you for who you are, and that makes you more popular. You can meet more friends and fit in with more groups. That is basically being popular.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|YNDIUS8taa	Just be nice. And not annoying. Start up a conversation with different people, and that way you can see who you want in your life as a friend and who you don't. Wear what looks good on you, and what makes you feel like you look good. Say what comes to mind. Be friends with people who you can have fun with, but still trust them. About the guy- don't ask guys out. Wait for someone to ask you out, because someone will. Just start talking to all different people and things will start happening for you.
T1OFtmB5aa	This is a very confusing question.<br>  Are you talking about your body?<br>  If you have questions the best advice is to see a OB/GYN.<br>  Also talking to other female friends helps.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	well edward its like this .. as a girl you must know what you like then just do that .. move if you want to .. by edward|`|zczCQRNdaa	pray to God that it is over soon...|`|wIKvnsb0aa	You can move your legs and arms, lift you butt, arch ur back. You can move but its mainly up to him. i usually move my arms to touching his chest or above my head. It's what you like. I also squeeze my legs around him, and lift to change angles.
Jo2DfRzaaa	i knew something wasn't right the next day.  i was 3 or 4.  thank god it was only one time but it was still enough to affect me, 20 something year later.  i had my "epiphany" so to speak when i was about 15.  i struggled on and off for the next probably 7 years or so internally.  i am okay today.  not past it, but not hateful about it either.  he is the only person i could actually spit on, the only person i would thank god when he is no longer walking this earth.  i know god understands that and i know he knows i'm not able to be in any other place with it.  it doesn't consume me anymore.  i could probably benefit from counseling though.  but i can truthfully say i'm okay.<br>  keep it up girl!|`|qSmCA82Aaa	I was when I was 6 years old by my uncle.  I didn't tell for 2 years bc he told me it was secret and that if I said anything everyone woyld be mad at me.  Well 2 years after that I finally told my best friend whom then told my mom- my mom helped me alot- (she almost killed him though) I think I went to counseling a few times and no I think its something you never truly get over- it goes away but at times it still bothers me.  There will times when my husband will grab or touch me somewhere when I'm not expecting it and I jump and get this sick feeling and shivers- its times like that that it comes back.<br>    I'm very overprotected of my children bc of it.   If you ever want to talk messeage me ;)|`|744mMkIQaa	I'M STILL TRYING TO GET OVER THE ABUSE I HAD BEEN THROUGH IN LIFE WITH RELATIONSHIPS I HAVE BEEN IN. I HAVE MY DAYS WHERE IS HARDER THEN OTHER DAYS BUT I TRY TO OVERCOME THE FEELING AND THOUGHTS OF IT BUT YES IT'S HARD WHEN SOMETHING SO BAD HAS HAPPENED TO YOU IN YOUR LIFE..|`|28ace4b478f0d1936cd87055ad9fff5eaa	It will take time. Remember, the only way "out" is "through."|`|f4zg7LHLaa	well i have been abused all my life until i was 9. but the sexual abuse started at 18mos old. i was in foster care, and suffered sexual abuse in both homes i was placed with. the 1st home i was there till 4, and had no idea what was going on. the 2nd home, i was more aware. i tried to tell the foster mother, but she didn't believe me that her son would do something like that, and locked me in my room for days.<br>  <br>  it was only when i got to live with my father that i told my step mum what happened ( i think i was 10) i don't know what made me tell her, but i know we had just watched Titanic (funny how things stick in your head)<br>  i told her" _____ said i could hvae his gameboy if i sucked his winkie, but he didn't give me it" i think i was actually more upset then that i didn't get the gameboy!<br>  i have been to numerous councellors, but i don't think they do me any good. i find it easier to deal with on my own. but i do still have nightmares, and sometimes i freak out at my fiance, which hurts him, but he is very understanding. i don't think i will ever get over my abuse.|`|AA10832226	its hard to deal with i was being abused at the age 4 until i was 9 and im 20 now. i haven't been able to deal with it and i've tried meds., counseling and even confronting the person... but it may be different for other people|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I was raped when I was 14.  I went through emotions ranging from sadness, anger, feeling helpless and hopeless, fear and pure rage.  It has been nearly 9 years since and I still have flash backs and hate being alone!  When I am alone I will have moments of paralyzing fear where I can't move im just like a statue im so scared.  I  don't think anybody ever "Gets Over" sexual abuse but you just eventually cope with it and except it as an unfortunate part of who you are.  The hardest part for me was to stop blaming myself and taking control back over my own life.  I also find comfort in my faith in God which helped me to forgive and find peace.  I will never be the same as before but I have learned to except that.  I am so sorry that happened to you.  I wish you the best of luck!  xoxoxoxoxoxoxo
E2OKRhwYaa	I guess he's making you nervous, just pretend he's not there maybe and talk to the person you feel most comfortable with in the group or ask a random question that starts up an active conversation, or think of something that relaxes you or makes you laugh.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	I felt the same way once when I was high school about the whole group thing. One just talk when it's necessary. Don't just say anything. Your not an outcast, they just don't know you so all they know to do is not talk to you. Essentially is ignorant and immature. So just take it slow.|`|feAlXABSaa	U need to just ask questions about the project then when it's almost time to be over and u have extra time you'll feel more comfortable talkining to him or he'll talk to u|`|AA11712920	ask if you can switch groups or try switching classes or just get your parents in to switch your classes|`|r1hzoaVDaa	Aww, I hate when that happens. I feel like a total outcast in a couple of my classes, though I do have friends in others. Sometimes that WILL happen, and it's beyond your control. You can try talking to your teacher and just stating that you feel like you can't get your opinions in and you can ask if you can be switched over to another group that you feel you will work better with. Good luck! (:|`|z9IoWlHGaa	don't look at him and ignore him|`|A2u06IS1aa	your probably just nervous that he might think that you arent a fun person. YOU gotta prove yourself wrong with that:) start a random conversation and listen to what he says:)|`|j4OBEeAlaa	i sympathize.this often happens to me.i feel to shy to talk to people or a certain person and by the time i decide to pluck up courage to speak,group work is over lol talk to the guy.start by talking about the group and make comments and chat with him.(well,at least start by saying hi lol) dont be scared to speak.people in your group might be happy to hear what you have to say.good luck with that^^
BaAdaDYTaa	I met my fiancee in 2003 in an online game. We trusted each other from day one because we made a promise to each other and kept it. We trusted each other with one of our accounts in a game. We became very good friends. After a while, we lost contact because we ended up having another partner in our lives. But, at the same time, I was having feelings for my future fiancee while I was dating another girl, whom I met online. The only way you can be sure the person is real is if you see the person on web cam. That was exactly what I did with my ex and my fiancee.<br>  <br>  I saw my ex on web cam, but I did not have a web cam at the time. We did exchange phone numbers and talked on the phone and on YIM. We met in person the same day we met online. We dated for only six months and twelve days, though.<br>  <br>  There was one time I was "dating" a minor and I did NOT even know it. She lied about her age, stating that she was 18!! I showed her a website that I belonged to and she put down her age as 17!! I was so furious with her that I broke up the relationship, besides the fact that she was "cheating" on me at the same time. I knew that if she lied about her age, she might have lied about everything else, except her name and where she lived. I just ended all contact with her. I thought that she could have been 14 or 15. She had an online bf who was 27 at the time. She was one of those girls who just wanted to use a guy to come to the USA.<br>  <br>  As for my fiancee, we dated online for over a year before we met in person. We chatted a while and saw each other on web cam every time we chatted before we met in person. Seeing each other on web cam is very important in online dating so that you know who you are chatting and dealing with. We agreed to meet each other so my father and I both went to see her and her mother. My fiancee and I clicked right away and five days later, I proposed to her to which she accepted. We had the most blissful time of our lives when I was with her in her country. She was the kind of woman I have been wanting all my life. I do not regret all the positive things that happened between us.<br>  <br>  My fiancee is the last of many girls I met from online. The other girls I met from online were from my native Vietnam when I went to visit my homeland. I had always wanted to see it. I met most of the girls in person and there was one who wanted to be with me, but I felt very uncomfortable since I was with my girlfriend (my fiancee).<br>  <br>  My encounter with my fiancee was a very rare case of trusting someone online from the very start. Normally, you should not trust people online, but there are always exceptions. I agree that you need to be very careful as to whom you meet online. I also agree that you should always bring someone with you, just in case something happens. My ex and I both had brought one person with us for the "double date."|`|0WlX5Jvhaa	been there done that. I met my boyfriend online, and we so far have been with each other for 2 months. I met him in person about 4 days after meeting him online and we are doing good so far. My one friend is married to a guy and has a baby with him and they met online. Just be careful, some people are not who they say they are.|`|NHcs5Gyqaa	NO and you shouldn't. haven't you heard of online predators. this person you are talking to who you think is some hot guy is probably some old fat guy in his mother's basement who is going to kidnap you and well....and you will never see your friends and family ever again|`|AA12117694	yeah, not really all that awkward cause you both like each other and if you are being truful online (at least I am) then it cuts the stress;).

cB2VGhLgaa	Hmm... shes a follower, she is so desperate to fit in w/ this girl that she has to change herself and ditch her old friends. Shes not a good friend, so you should be the one to ditch her.|`|ixHwF4apaa	avoid him, try to find better friend/bf.|`|A2u06IS1aa	She probably looks up to her. Probably thinking that shes kool and such.  I think that you shuold look for another friend to hang out with. If a friend ditches you and acts like your best friend one moment then the next acts like they hate you..<br>  <br>  They arent really a friend to you:)|`|4tDTQOgNaa	Well all I got to say is monkey see monkey do. She obviously wants to fit in. So if you really love or support your friend then be advised that you will be treated like **** but if you know that this isn't for you then find a new friend.|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	She idolizes the girl. It happens. I can't believe 16 is under the legal age *giggles* It's 14 and up here. Anyways, you should tell her you don't like how she shuts you out.|`|E2OKRhwYaa	She's being a follower and they're leaving you out, find a new and better friend.|`|r1hzoaVDaa	She's trying so hard to impress the bitchy friend that she's forgetting about her other friends. I've dealt with it before. Everyone has. You can try talking to her about it, and if all else fails, realize that she's not being a very good friend and try to surround yourself with genuine people. (:|`|wyUhx5b6aa	hmmm, just let her have space and meanwhile do your own thing. Don't let her make or break you either.  Sometimes are friends that we grow up with change and go in different directions. If you don't feel thats the direction for you then that is just fine. Thats all part of growing up.....|`|EnAtAmHoaa	she's probably having some self esteem issues and thinks that this girl is cool and appears confident. therefore she wants to be like that to give her ego, self confidence, and esteem a boost. ever seen thirteen??? sorry bad analogy|`|4IhXjUpFaa	she is trying to impress her trying to act like she can talk to you however she wants trust me i've seen how girls like her act|`|64f2a9b83825b1933d7b7f935d2f7325aa	thats people's personality. cant change it unless u convince them or they convince themselves. its life.|`|sT7YnwBSaa	warn her... and you cant do nothing cause she has her own life.. if there will be a bad thing that will happen to her... she will go back to you and you comfort her|`|z9IoWlHGaa	Because she maybe wants to turn out bad like them u know.

He could start out trying to teach her sign language as well. He could spell out the letters in her hand. This is the way Helen Keller communicated.

Did you ever say to him that you had a boyfriend? Maybe someone told him that you had got one so he got a girlfriend, or maybe he thought you hadn't phoned him for 2 months so you had just moved on, who knows. More information is needed to find out what you had an argument about, so it might give us some more clues. Good luck with everything|`|IOsrDhrJaa	I'll bet you anything he does not have a girlfriend. What tells me this is that he asked you right off the bat how your boyfriend is...and you dont have one and he has no way of knowing if you do or dont.

I dealt with it for 6 plus yrs.  <br>  <br>  Here's a little info of what I went through..and for the record prior to him I was married a long time.  There are grown children and living their lives..Yes grand mom too..Anyways I had no idea that dealing with someone with drama that included f/u women/exes of his and he had lots to do with it.  <br>  <br>  Present time friends we are for I initiated it for he is ALWAYS the first to come back yes always came back present time just a booty as all the others are.  He made promises that never made it to two months..I ate alot ****..yet I knew it ALL and still do.  I threw it all out there..He knew I was on point..he often shitted in his pants..<br>  <br>  Nevertheless i got rid of him no matter what one does without being evil it turns out he once again just came around to used me again..yep i knew and I once again believe and obliged his request. He is out there playing the same f/u games..lying, using, hurting same exes and fresh new faces too. I even have had my share of nonsense with them even on here..I give a **** and I am being a bit nice with my choice of words here..if they read this and I know they will and she and they continue to put b/s on here or there..Some are oblivious to believe that he is so exclusively hers..No he is not, he goes back and forth me, pr, long island, etc etc yeah codes from where we are from.... But this is about you...<br>  <br>  To you as much as you care and still feel for him..think first and foremost about YOU..is this what you want in your life? Is this how you want to live? If he could not have told you why he dumped u then..It is totally f/u on him to do that now two months later come now girl that right there is not only a lack of disrespect with a slap on the face but MAJOR lack of communication! Ignore him move on you have your whole life ahead of you..You will find some one who is going to love, respect and totally appreciate you for who u are..beautiful inside and out.  Good luck to you
di3oPe8waa	I like them in this order: 1, 2, then 3.<br>  <br>  3 is pretty but overdone. So many brides have had dresses like that over the last few years.<br>  <br>  2 is very nice. I love the lace.<br>  <br>  1 is my favourite. It is similar to 2, but it just has that extra oomph with the deep neckline and the spacing of the detailing.  It really makes you go "wow" whereas the other two are just pretty.<br>  <br>  Great taste in dresses though!|`|7WbehQZjaa	I love number 3 but you should try on the dresses before you get too set in which one to drool over.

I love it|`|qhfSOrq9aa	i like the first one. its way classier.|`|MLc8OSQiaa	i like the first one the best.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	one is my favorite, but three is nice too. not a fan of number two.|`|8GZLEGtZaa	3 i love|`|jhVpSq2yaa	the first one for sure!|`|2o3BHgCCaa	In order of favourite: 1, 3, 2.<br>  I think for your physique 3 would be the most flattering and I love the touch of colour.|`|Qas05nZraa	dress one|`|AA10565336	I'm an old man but for whatever it's worth, I like #2 more than any of the others.  But, I would still keep looking if I were you.  I think you can do a LOT better than any of those choices.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I love their dresses as well they do catch the eye. Out of the 3 dresses you have listed dress one is my favorite. It sticks out the most to me.

0ky4TktEaa	You just contradicted yourself. First you claim you don't need a "psychology lesson", then you ask if you need to change something in you. <br>  <br>  Anyway to answer your question, if you are considered ugly and a loser by most people, why would you think girls would notice you as anything but an ugly loser. With the "selfish bastard" label, same thing. That doesn't exactly draw people in. If you want to change that, change people's opinions of you. By that i do not mean change who you truly are. Some will just not like you no matter what you do. Start talking more. Make yourself more approachable. Consider the clothes you wear and the manner in which you carry yourself. All these things evoke a certain image that other people may or may not respond to in a positive way. In other words, if you dress all in black and hang by yourself, don't expect anyone to notice you; you'd be evoking an image that clearly says "leave me alone". <br>  <br>  Consider the things you say when you do talk to people. For example on't be a sarcastic a$s; some people can deal with it, some even like it; most, don't care for it. Do that enough, you get a reputation that will drive even people who don't know you away.<br>  <br>  So where girls are concerned, speak up more. Little things like asking a girl who sits near you about a homework assignment and allowing that to lead into a broader conversation, can go a long way. You have to start somewhere and more often than not, it takes a bit of time to get to know people. Doesn't always happen overnight.|`|AA12117694	sounds like the people saying **** about you need to be beat. The people do that because they think it hurts you, never let someone walk over you like that. To answer the lady part, go talk to girls..go up to them, make them laugh..be stupid, be random..they love it lol.|`|tYnpVHpZaa	Try being someone else, and then ease yourself into the relationship.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	just be your self, don't try to be something that your not. change how you look, and talk. but be your self|`|LDiZJp98aa	just be confident about your self and if you want to persure a relationship with a girl just become her friend and get to know her over time, dont try to force her into talking to you or anything just be paticent with girls they are very unpridictible and it just takes time and patience and soon enough you will get the girl of dreams, everybody fails at times but its just a matter of keep on trying|`|aNj47Xoeaa	Maybe you should try listening to them first :D It's okay to talk, but don't do it too often. When I talk, I try to keep it to a minimum and make sure I'm a good listener XD You should try it too! :)|`|ZS8eBOfZaa	same problem dude.<br>  <br>  everyone answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Akx2d7nTKDOP6_gxodD.8a7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227180820AAA7aTE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|SW4L24ZUaa	No dude confident guys are hot. I would talk back if a guy came up to me and said hey let's talk. But I know some girls aren't like that.

Of course, I don't know the girls at your school, but I know I don't like to make my feelings clear, either. Don't worry, because I'm thirteen, and I've never had a boyfriend, either. Guys don't notice me. Except my best guy friend, but we won't get into that. ha ha. Trust me, it's probably not you. You should just be you. The "hey let's talk" thing works at my school, but again, I don't know the girls there. Take it from someone who knows, people won't notice you until you notice them first. I really hope it works out for you. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Annabelle|`|C7fensdhaa	Well,<br>   First of all never talk about yourself, unless your asked. It makes it sound like you think your more important. If you really like someone well find out about them, but dont freak them out, and dont ask any of their friends. You should know about them, but dont let them know that you know about them. If you ask one of their friends its going to be hell because the whole school will know about it.<br>   If you really think your ugly well find your dominant features and try to improve. Try to improve your clothes that always helps.<br>   Then strike a conversation just to talk dont make it sound like your trying to hit on them. Then end the conversation when its over,dont linger over stupid things.|`|lTPPXjqIaa	Bud, your 15 years old...you won't have a serious relationship for a while...just take your time with that stuff, ..."Hey, Lets Talk" is actually a fairly decent opening line, or try something like..."i noticed you over here, and i wanted to get to know the personality behind the pretty face" cheesy yes,  but your looking at 15 year old girls, they aren't going to bite, worst thing they are going to do is laugh...you move on and your fine, stop stressing...it'll come with time|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	just be happy|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Only HELP i can give you is called the Target Analyzer, look at the guys who are geting what you want, Learn from them< i am not saying COPY everthing they do but they must have some tricks up there seleves, ..

zn1aEbZWaa	A lot of people have told me that it is rude to put it in the invitation (though in the one wedding I was invited to, they did). I'm planning on putting it on my wedding website. Other than that, I've heard that you're just supposed to let guests ask a family member or member of the bridal party, which seems really unorganized to me.|`|2SFztKuKaa	It is not rude to include where you are registered in the invitation. I have been to several weddings and in each and every invite I got, there was a card to show where the couple was registered.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	You should wait for people to ask.  Make sure that your attendants and close family know, so if people ask them, they'll know!  You should not include this on your invitations.  Your instinct is right, it is considerd very rude according to every wedding etiquette book or magazine I've ever read.  I would avoid sending an email, this makes it look as though you are asking for gifts.  If people want to get you something, they'll find out where you're registered.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	No, you should not put it on the invitation. Have friends and family spread it by word of mouth where you are registered. Usually people will call the family or wedding party and ask. One of your bridal party can call everyone and tell them, but not the bride.w|`|217b09cad4499d84073afef0392b44b2aa	For the last wedding I went to the slipped a card into the invitation's envelope with the registry place and number. They also wanted some money to help them with their home, so they attached a poem<br>  <br>  "if you were thinking of giving a gift,<br>  to help us on our way.<br>  A gift of cash towards our house and honeymooon,<br>  would really make our day.<br>  However, if you prefer to purchase a gift,<br>  feel free to suprise us in your own way"<br>  <br>  perhaps you could have a card that said something along the lines of "if you were thinking of giving a gift, we have made it easier for you to select" and then have the web address and registry number<br>  <br>  generally it is common practice to have the gift registry place and number with the invitation- and no I certainly don't think that it's rude<br>  <br>  have a great day!!|`|9UpKxA1yaa	It is not good etiquette to put in with the invitation. Guests can ask the bride, groom, friends and family of the couple and they will tell them where they are registered.<br>  <br>  I have also registered online. The guests can either go to the specific store or their website to buy the gift, no matter how you register for the gifts. I hope that helps!|`|1a8f556a514b8f836795e2adfdcd3848aa	We put ours on the wedding invitation.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	No.  It is a supreme breach of etiquette to include the gift registry information on the invitation.  In the world of wedding etiquette, there are few things more frowned upon than this.  It's practically criminal. <br>  <br>  The idea behind this is that the host's duty is just that-- to host.  She should not be thinking of her guests in terms of presents.  And while should should not expect gifts, she certainly should not panhandle and beg for them.  And certainly, certainly not on the invitation itself.  The horror.<br>  <br>  To the extent that you have a gift registry, you should not send this information in the mailing.  Ask your parents, his parents, and your bridal party to pass it along via word of mouth.
dQrBlk4qaa	I think before you two get to the point of no return, you two should put a plan together to help him get out of his job and the rut he's in, and do something that will keep him home more. Get it going, and commit to it. <br>  <br>  I'm sure he's nervous now, given the economy, but if he's got to figure out a good way to either use his skills to get a better job, or develop new ones that will get him in a better place.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	You married him... IS his occupation a surprise to you?<br>  If he gets so little time off... I'm not surprised that he sleeps and does mind-less games on the one day off.<br>  The economy is HORRIBLE right now.  <br>  I say support him - try not to *****.  His job is a b*tch.<br>  When the economy levels out - talk about changing occupations.<br>  In the mean time.. take up hobbies.  Make some girlfriends.<br>  Make your life a happy place. <br>  <br>  If I were in your shoes, there would be some things I would like about having time to myself, but this is extreme...I know that.|`|veZLfnGFaa	I'm sorry, but if I were you, I would get out of this relationship.

Learn each other again. Talk, fight, and make up. Sometimes road trips really help people. Good luck!!|`|ibaLRXY2aa	Try to develop some close girl friendships so you have people to hang out with on the weekends. I would normally tell you to try to get your hubby to get a job that's not so time-consuming, but with the economy the way it is, he'd better hang onto it while he can. Maybe after things start picking up again he can get a job that will keep him at home more.<br>  <br>  ETA: He probably won't stand up to his company because he's afraid of losing his job if he doesn't do everything they want him to. Times are tough right now. I hope things get better for you.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	Tell him to grow some b-a-l-l-s and stand up to his superior. He doesn't have to be rude to them, but he needs to tell them what's up ... Good luck!|`|ltXxNfwRaa	Oh hun, I'm in the same boat as you!<br>  <br>  My man works in the oil patch and he's also gone for weeks at a time.  He'll tell me he's coming home then he'll tell me last minute that he got sent to another job.  You never really get used to it.  I love being by myself too and we also dont have kids... but you just have those times where all you wanna do is curl up in a corner and cry!  (I've done it a few times!)<br>  <br>  Just do as much as you can while he's gone.  I make the same mistakes and wrap my whole world around when he's coming home.  But the last time he came home, I blew him off and pretended like I wasnt too concerned weather or not he was home.  When he left for his buddy's he called me 6 times in 2 hours asking me if I was joining them and he never does that!<br>  <br>  Make sure you talk every day, but every once in a while when he calls, dont answer the phone.  He'll wonder where you are, and if he starts to worry about it, then he'll probably be more attentive to you when he actually does get home.  But if you give him the impression that you're at his beck and call, he will just watch tv when he's home because he knows youre around reguardless!<br>  <br>  As far as the job as a whole.  Tell him that you need him to set dates that he's gonna come home and stick to them.  Even if its only once a month!  I-don't-knows dont cut it in the relationship world and if he wants you to stick around, he better make the effort!  Just be assertive!  I know the economy sucks right now but people should still be working to live, not living to work!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

You're only 12 go out and enjoy yourself, boys come and go and you will learn this as time goes on.<br>  <br>  There is one good thing that has come out of this though... At least now you know that the girl was not a true friend especially when she knew you were really interested in him and now has the cheek to be hanging up on you. Her guilty conscious is why she can't even face up to you so just let them be and all you can do is wait for time to help heal your pain.<br>  <br>  I know you won't believe this right now but one day you will look back on this and laugh and probably wonder why you made such a fuss over a guy who is so obviously not worth it,|`|cJbtCv9kaa	I have been in the same situation many times.

f82ca064408f97079f4b157a223b1e36aa	Yeah...she likes you.  An answer above said something really good.  Just casually ask her to hang out..."as friends".  Do this a few times and next thing you know...you will be dating  :)  It sounds like to me you are too shy to make the move.  Hang out with the friends context and you will be able to tell if she really wants to take it to the next level.  Watch for signs like touching, body language...you'll know.<br>  <br>  Girls are strange...huh....  :)|`|b73a9dffdb8ef837de56dbe2f25b1cf1aa	I think you already know the answer to this. Of course she likes you! Why don't you just start asking her some questions like 'do you want to hang out on Friday/Saturday (whatever) night...just you and me?' and see what she says. If you like her, start to show it.|`|393709e68d69780283857ab7b8d81c70aa	sounds like she likes u!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9181b26f76f473ef3f2e9dfd2542d30aaa	The only for sure way to find out is to talk to her. I know scary, but if you don't and do nothing you will never know, and have that regret. The worst that could happen is that she says no and try to stay friends- it is not the end of the world- or best case scenerio, she didn't tell your friends the truth because she knew he would just turn around and tell you, and you to end up going out- My advice go for it, you only get one life, don't have any regrets!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|abe0a9485551536925a8ae34b30d4bc2aa	YEP, she has the hots for you, you lucky duck!!|`|d67c5d4b1462ee73aeefdefb705450fdaa	as i am not psychic, i cannot know if she likes you or not, but you can find out. ask her friends if she likes you. theres a pretty good chance if she does, she has told her friends. or you could beast it and just ask her directly, but that takes a lot of courage|`|0fefcb13dec4fa7e1dc0d6413f3151b3aa	ok im just going to put this straight forward<br>  no mean to be harsh or anything<br>  but if you like her grow some balls and ask her.<br>  if u think that she likes u go for it<br>  i know its hard (i myself have been told to grow soem as well haha)<br>  but if u just try show confidence you will probably get her.<br>  girls are just as insecure about their feeligns as you and i (as boys) are<br>  and if you dotn go for her some one else might get to her.<br>  <br>  ask her how she feels about you and if she doesnt feel the same way dont go down and cry just say ok and carry on to something else.<br>  <br>  im sorry if it doesnt work out and jsut makes ur relationship akward but its better than to go on knowing that going crazy whether or not she feels the same way.<br>  perhaps use Myspace or an Instant messanger cuz its less akward.<br>  <br>  p.s. tell me what happens lol|`|9f5f940230e3ce293e5bbcf8eb05dcdbaa	either she is a huge flirt or she really wants you. i think you should ask her on a date.|`|AA11962471	Hello Need girl help?<br>  <br>  I think you have it under control. Yes she do like you. and you know what, life is to short so do the man thing and ask her out and I bet you she'll do the lady thing and say YES. <br>  <br>  so have fun on your date.|`|c2869bb478fc6b26bb52c7c7cd2b80aeaa	This sounds like she really likes yoiu. I think if you really want to know, you should ask her out, or if you're freaked out, maybe give her a clue that you like her. Girls are usually just as afriad of asking a guy out, so they'll say they don't like you, when they do. But if you suggest maybe going on to a movie...just the two of you, or something maybe yopu'll have an answer. Good luck!!!- Liz

I'm a girl of personality, I'd rather date a smart nice ugly guy. I wouldn't call him ugly because I determine beauty throughout personality.

Personality is everything.|`|e8f2ba223ef9957cbbe545268f522ebbaa	i would never talk to a self centered jerk - let alone date him!!!!<br>  <br>  but if a guy i wasn't initially attracted to made me swoon, I'd be  all over him.|`|wyEdgOXJaa	A nice guy because its hard to find one now a days.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	El Dr. José Gregorio Hernández, fue un médico nacido en Venezuela, en el interior del País en un pueblo llamado INOZTU, y dedicó su vida a servirle a  los pobres, es decir, los visitaba a su casa para examinarlos, sobre todo aquellos que no podian ir a su casa, ya que el tenia su consultorio allí y no les cobrada nada a los pobres y a los que tenían más dinero en ese tiempo les decia que les dieran lo que ellos quisieran ya que con ese dinero lo  utilizaba para comprar los remedios de sus pacientes. Se cuenta que a veces las personas  le decian que no tenían dinero para pagarle, pero que despues le pagaban, y el les decía que no importaba y antes de salir de sus casas, les dejaba debajo de la almohada algo de dinero para ayudarlos.  <br>  <br>  Estudió para sacerdote en Roma, pero por su salud se tuvo que salir ya que enfermó por el frio que hacia en el Monasterio donde estuvo en retiro. Murio muy joven en el sector donde vivia, despues de salir de una botica o farmacia al tratar de pasar la calle lo atropello en una esquina el único automóvil que habia en esa epoca en Caracas. <br>  <br>  Después de su muerte se le adjudican muchos milagros, y está en estudio su beatificación. Sus restos reposan en una Iglesia en Caracas. <br>  <br>  Son muchas las personas que le tienen devoción, no solo de Venezuela sino de varios países del mundo. No he tenido la oportunidad de visitar INOZTU pero me cuentan que van muchas personas  de todas partes del mundo y el Papa Juan Pablo II  visito varias veces ese sitio y creo una Iglesia en su nombre.<br>  <br>  P.D. Nunca se casó, y dedico su vida al bien de los mas necesitados  ya que no pudo ser sacerdote por enfermarse en Roma. Y  dedicó también su vida a Dios, era un hombre muy cristiano y de excelentes sentimientos, principios morales y Fé.  Era muy callado y reservado, un hombre de estatura peque?a, de piel muy blanca, de cabellos y bigotes muy ****** y siempre se vestia de trajes ****** y blancos con pantalones a veces de cuadritos ****** y blancos de esa epoca.<br>  <br>  Son muchos testimonios de personas de todo nivel social, que en estados de gravedad le han visto y se han sanado, en fin son infinidades de milagros que se le adjudican.<br>  <br>  P.D. Me extra?a que tu siendo venezolano no hayas escuchado hablar nunca del Dr. José Gregorio Hernández Y PORQUE DICES QUE PIENSAS PEOR A LA RESPUESTA QUE TE DIERON ANTES, ENTONCES PARA QUE DESEAS SABER QUIEN ES éL. PARA CRITICAR? Y le respondo a ese que dice que el se proclamo Hijo de Dios, de donde saca eso, si ni siquiera sabe quien es. A veces es mejor quedarse callado si no se sabe de que se habla para no hacer el ridículo. De verdad si hubiera leido lo que le respondiste que piensas peor, ni siquiera me hubiera atrevido a responderte, pero escribi tanto que me da flojera borrar todo. Y por que dices que eres Venezolano, por eso también quise responderte. Chao!!! Y AL KAMUY ese se lo paso porque estoy segura que no es VENEZOLANO y no sabe de que está hablando, pero Tú?. Además estas preguntando quién es, y te escribí parte de su historia.<br>  DESPUES DE SU MUERTE FUE QUE LE EMPEZARON A DECIR EL CIERVO DE DIOS, POR LOS MILAGROS QUE HACE Y POR LA VIDA SANTA QUE TUVO. <br>  No fué él el que se proclamo el Cirvo de Dios, fue un hombre sumamente humilde a pesar de haber estudiado médicina y hablar varios idiomas.|`|0d9f875f99896081abd50e2c619df1b2aa	El medico de los pobres.

He hits you a lot. (just play hitting)<br>  3. He uses the first thing that pops into his head to start a conversation with you<br>  4. He yelled, "Hi!" to your mom that day she picked you up from school.<br>  5. He tries to make you laugh anyway even if he gets hurt in the process<br>  6. His voice gets softer ("Hey, you") when ever you two talk.<br>  7. You were invited by him to a group outing.<br>  8. He called you to talk about nothing at all.<br>  9. He imitates your laugh (OK, you do snort sometimes) which makes you laugh even harder.<br>  10. He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  11. He sometimes stares straight into your eyes.<br>  12. He uses every possible way to touch you (your hair, face, arms, back, etc.)<br>  13. He says hi to you every time he sees you in the halls or around town.<br>  14. He tries his hardest to make you mad or annoyed. Just to be funny)<br>  <br>  <br>  There r way to many signs to just have one clear one because people show how they feel in many diff ways...<br>  <br>  ~For a guy~!<br>  <br>  ***How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  <br>  * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  <br>  *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  <br>  *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  <br>  *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  <br>  *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)<br>  <br>  These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, you like orange fizz..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa.

Así como con la conducta, generalizando, de los hombres que tenemos sexo pagado, por amistad, por compromiso o también ocasional, no necesariamente en estos casos existe infidelidad, porque no sentimos necesariamente afecto alguno por las mujeres con las que nos relacionamos.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	No deberías de generalizar, no todas somos infieles. Mi respuesta personal es que cuando tengo pareja es porque lo amo y no le sería infiel. Ahora bien, si le descubro que me enga?a y me es infiel o dejo de amarlo, tomo la decisión de hablarle y terminar la relación antes de comenzar con otro. Pero nunca haría lo que no me gustaría que me hicieran a mí. En lo particular pienso que más se ve la infidelidad del hombre hacia la mujer que de la mujer hacia el hombre. Bye y besos.<br>  P.D. Cuando se tiene un novio es PORQUE SE AMA Y NO EXISTE LA INFIDELIDAD, PERO SI EN ESE HOMBRE NO ENCUENTRAS LO QUE TU DESEAS, ENTONCES DEJALO Y BUSCATE OTRO.

Es una edad difícil, es cuando los ni?os están como una esponja, absorbiendo todo lo que ven a su alrededor. Recuerda que ella nació primero y lo que siente es CELOS por su hermanito. Pero por lo que dices, ya se está pasando porque lo maltrata y tu deber es castigarla. Pero pienso que deberías sentarla y hablarle, decirle que tu la amas y quieres igual que a su hermanito, que los dos son importantes para ti y que necesitas que ella te ayude a cuidarlo porque es más grande que él. Que por eso ella no debe de pegarle ni hacerle da?o que más bien lo cuide por ser menor que ella. Te aconsejo no seas dura con ella, porque eso le traerá más rencor hacia su hermano, ella está peque?a aún y no entiende como controlar ese sentimiento que son los celos. Por eso es mejor que la lleves al PSIQUIATRA O PSICóLOGO INFANTIL. Ya verás como el te ayudará con unos tips o consejos de como tratarla y que hacer para ayudarla a ambas. Suerte y besos.<br>  P.D.

1dea3ce284651000a1f30f8c0573fffbaa	Oye amiga antes de ser sexualmente activa te debes de informar de varias cosas no crees no solo es darle gusto al cuerpo, hast apara eso se necesita suficiente informacion, toda vez que tengan relaciones ya sean vaginales,anales u orales corren el riesgo de contagiarse desde una minima ro?ita o  una irritacion por frotamiento hasta SIDA es por eso que se debe usar condon no solo para no quedar embarazada si no para prevenir posibles contagios, el riesgo no desaparece pero disminuye, es verdad si no tienen una buena higiene sobretodo las relaciones anales son muy posibles de contagios es por eso que se recomienda usar condon y lubricantes, y en las relaciones orales es recomendable no tener heridas en labios o encias y de preferencia no haberse lavado los dientes antes de esto para evitar sangrados y fuentes o puntos de contagio, siempre usen condon no solo por evitar embarazos si no por propia seguridad y obtengan suficiente informacion.Suerte|`|FGlceEz1aa	existen diferentes infecciones pero las mas comunes son  gonorrea o chancros blancos que son de transmisión sexual y si se tiene contacto anal y después vaginal infecciones por eses fecales o sífilis y por sexo oral puede aver transmisión de hepatitis si esta persona tiene sangrado accidental o sida si lo tiene contraído el hombre o si no tiene limpieza puede transmitirte varias enfermedades|`|af68d3afe9635f463d0670eb8d9872bbaa	El hombre puede tener infecciones urinarias severas, igual que la mujer, si no usan preservativo y no hay una higiene buena despues.<br>  Sexo oral: lo mas frecuente es hacerse portador de gonorrea en fauces, y hacer la enfermedad o transmitirla.

Lamentablemente el sexo anal es uno de los más riesgosos para la transmisión de infecciones, por eso es importante usar condón especial y lubricante a base de agua. Si hay contacto también vaginal, es muuuy importante lavar el pene antes de introducirlo en la vagina, ya que esto puede llegar a ser fuente de tricomonas.<br>  <br>  En el sexo oral: cualquier infección puede transmitirse, por eso es importante usar condón también.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte... que lo disfruten!|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Las mismas que puedes tener por la parte de adelante, sin cuidarte con preservativos e higiene siempre estarás dispuesta a contraer alguna enfermedad venerea.  Son muchisimas, gonorrea, sifíles, VPH (virus de papiloma humano) SIDA (Sindrome de inmunodeficiencia adquirida), bacterias, gonococos, etc. Solo cuidence, tengan higiene y sean parejas estables, es decir que no sean promiscuos de estar con otras parejas, eso es lo más recomendable para no adquirir ese tipo de enfermedades.  Suerte y que disfrutes tu sexualidad sanamente. <br>  P.D. Si es tu pareja fija y no es promiscuo, es decir que no se acuesta con otras sino contigo nada mas, no creo que por el sexo oral puedas contraer alguna enfermedad.

Pfmtjqbpaa	Tu lo has dicho, viste un se humano que necesita ayuda; si los demas no tienen el mismo corazón para poder ver mas allá de su nariz no es tu problema; no te sientas mal por la critica negativa has hecho una de las mejores cosas que puediste hacer en tu vida, se llama amor; dar algo desinteresamente, sin ver a quien, eres un angel, te felicito de todo corazón por esa capacidad de ayudar. Las personas con menos suerte que nosotros no estan así por que alguien les ayude a comer, o les de unas monedas, todo tiene una razón de ser, detras de cada uno de ellos hay una historia, de desamor, abandono, maltrato, lo peor... por eso han llegado hasta ahi, y tu corazón lo sabe y si ha podido ayudar con un buen gesto de compasión y la vida te ha dado lo suficiente para poder compartir un poco, es causa de mi admiración y respeto. Que bueno que hay personas como tú. Por otro lado no puedo descartar que tambien hay personas peligrosas, solo ten un poco de cuidado, sigue haciendo lo que tu corazón te dice, pero con un poco de precaución, y todo estara bien, Gracias por la comida y el boleto de regreso, gracias por la sonrisa, por la amabilidad, por tu confianza, por tu tiempo y compa?ia, por la platica tan amable, y por verme como lo que soy un simple ser humano. Creo que son las palabras que el vagabundo de ese día se quedo en su corazón; apoco no suenan mas bonito que las del trabajo? tu sabes que hiciste bien, y no se si seas catolico pero no decia Jesus que el tocaría a tu puerta vestido de vagabundo, y tu lo invitarias a cenar.

No entiendo porque el comentario de que si eras inseguro, aprecio tu gran corazon y bondad, de los buenos, como me decia un amigo, quedan pocos y yo se que tu eres uno de ellos!! <br>  Que lindo es ver que seas ese buen samaritano que ya no se encuentra en estos dias en los que vivimos, tiempos peligrosos y dificiles en los que los hombres son egolatras y amadores de si mismos, porque el amor y la bondad se han enfriado, es obvio que estas personas y tu estan hechos de diferentes cueros hermano, pero tu sigue en esa senda, la senda de la bondad, amor y misericordia, sabes algo? Una ves lei algo similar e incluso lo vi en una corta historia en la television y exactamente como tu alguien ayudo a un hermoso vagabundo del cual salia un brillo sin igual de sus ojos, tenia la piel hermosa muy cuidada y mejillas rosadas, una barba muy bien cuidada, una persona vagabunda pero se le veia un resplandor y algo diferente, pues al final cuando este hombre igual lo dejo en la estacion del tren este voltio en un segundo para decirle otra cosa y no lo pudo encontrar por ningun lado, sabes porque? Porque era un angel. Entonces con esto te digo que nunca sabremos si asistimos a un mismo angel de los cielos, el cual vino para dar una leccion de amor muy importante y hermosa a algunos de nosotros humanos llenos de fallas, esa nostalgia vino porque muy dentro de ti existen ese amor y esencia que al mismo tiempo se traducen a humildad.

No te imaginas lo feliz y la mirada de ese ni?o.  Y sabes que me dijeron mis vecinos?  QUE ESTAVA LOCA QUE PORQUE HACIA ESTO..que tal. Si todos en la vida hiciéramos eso ayudaríamos a muchos y le diéramos un rato de felicidad, atención y amor.<br>  Y algo que tomé por costumbre es, que cada vez que voy a comer a un restaurante siempre lo que me sobra, le pido al mesero que me lo envuelva para llevar y al salir busco a un mendigo y se lo doy.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Lamento mucho lo de tus padres, pero ya tienes un regalo de Dios y es tu hija. Como vas a decir que ni siquiera ella te da felicidad. Es que no te has puesto a pensar que tu infelicidad se la trasmites a ella, quien no tiene culpa de lo que te ha ocurrido a tí. Solo piensa un momento, que quieres de la vida, como arreglarla. Empieza por subir tu AUTOESTIMA eso de decir que eres POCA COSA jamás que salga de tu boca. Nadie es menos que nadie, el solo hecho de tener vida te debe hacer feliz. Te aconsejo que visites a un psiquiatra o psicólgo, quién te ayudará en esos problemas internos que vienes llevando desde hace tiempo. Pero...amiga, piensa tu solita decides si ser FELIZ o INFELIZ no permitas que otros decidan por tu felicidad. Lo que puedo notar en tu pregunta, es que te afecta más lo que te han hecho los hombres, que la vida de tu hija. Ese solo hecho de ser madre de una beba te debe dar ganas de seguir adelante, mejorar tu vida en todos los sentidos. No permitas, que por culpa de los hombres tu vida se arruine. Piensa, que no será la primera ni la última que un hombre la deje o le sea infiel. Busca dentro de tí, ese amor que tienes para tí y para los demás. Si no te quieres a tí misma, como podrás querer  a los demás. Busca  a Dios en tu corazón, hablale, dile que te ayude a superar todos esos obstáculos y aprende de ellos. La Vida es bella, búsca lo bonito y no te afinques en lo malo. Deja el pasado..y mira el presente. Sólo tu podrás ser feliz si te lo propones nadie te dirá como hacerlo. Eso se siente. No eres la única por la que ha pasado por cosas terribles, piensa eso. Otras tal vez han pasado por cosas peores y sin embargo han hechado para adelante. Busca, consejos, amistades, ayuda psiquiatrica y verás como en tu vida va a cambiar poco a poco. Acuerdate que nosotras mismas somos el arquitecto de nuestros sue?os y el constructor de nuestras vidas. Te deseo lo mejor del mundo y sube ese anímo. No soy madre, pero tengo ese sentimiento por los ni?os y pienso que el ser madre es el regalo más grandioso que Dios le puede dar a una mujer. Vive, Siente y sigue adelante. Acuerdate que lo que no nos deja nada positivo en nuestras vidas, como ese hombre que te da sufrimientos y te hace sentir poca cosa. DEJALO. Piensa en tí y en tu bebita y PA′LANTE AMIGA. QUE TU PUEDES.  No estas sola tienes por quién vivir y ser siempre la mejor. Superate, cambia de look, peinate diferente, haz algo, inscribete en un curso, estudia otro idioma, has deportes, metete en algo que te guste. Son tantas las cosas que puedes hacer por tí que no hay derecho que estes diciendo eso  que eres poca cosa y que nada ni nadie te hace feliz. Hay personas que viven solitas y sin embargo son felices, entonces, porque tu no. Tienes a tu lado a un angelito por quien vivir y ser MUY FELIZ. Suerte y que te mejores. <br>  P.D. Acuerdate que primero tú y tu hija y después los demás. Besos y que Dios te Bendiga y te quite esos pensamientos negativos que tienes en tu cabecita.|`|5cfc6f9cfa7bc83b2cfd460bc8aed7f7aa	amiga no pienses asi...<br>  tu vales mucho, mira a tu alrededor...<br>  olvida todo lo que te hace da?o y quienes te hacen da?o. lucha por salir adelante, tienes una hija ella es razon suficiente para ser feliz, lucha por eso no lo pierdas. si tu no te quieres entonces nadie lo va hacer.<br>  en un futuro llegara ese hombre que te valore y te quiera como te lo mereces, pero por ahora concentrate en tu hija, en ser feliz y sonreir!|`|3da40b76c23766629307375b3886d8d6aa	mira mi amor, es trizte lo que te ha pasado, mas aun es mas triste saber que no eres la unica con problemas tan grandes, yo te recomendaria que fueras a ver a un psicologo o inclusive a un doctor en medicina general y cuentale que te sientes deprimida, LA DEPRESION, que estoy seguro es lo que tu tienes es mas peligrosa de lo que nos imaginamos, ve a un doctor y muy probablemente el te dara algunas pastillas para tranquilizar la depresion, yo lo he hecho y funciona, solo que son pastillas o medicamentos que deben ser recetados por un doctor. algo que puedes hacer para empezar por tu misma, es ir a cualquier centro nutricional y comprar vitaminas B, eso me lo recomendo el doctor y tambien trata de tomar mucho jugo de naranja naturalito, eso contiene vitaminas y minerales que te ayudaran un poco. mas lo mas importante y ojala lo hagas es ir a buscar a un especialista. yo padeci o padesco de DEPRESION CRONICA, una de las emfermedades mas crueles y mas desconocidas en la actualidad, asi que se un poco de lo que te hablo. suerte. y si gustas platicar conmigo, escribeme a nicoperezq@msn.com, me encantaria saber de ti y saber que estaras mucho mejor. bendiciones.|`|7a9351dbc0e85eb5b2270aefb498353daa	Como que poca cosa!!!!!!!!!!!<br>   Busca un buen terapeuta, sicologo, habla  todo lo que te pasa.<br>  Es buenisimo, podes descubrir cosas que parten de tu infancia y que no las resolviste.<br>  Tenes una hija, como podes decir eso. Quizas estas depresiva por eso urgente busca ayuda y las parejas son circunstanciales hasta que las encontras pero tu hija no es circunstancial, no pongas energia donde no hay respuesta.<br>  Busca asesoramiento ya.<br>  SUERTE|`|b65ea468804d5d81f920ad4713d29912aa	ve la película de Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|`|wodzaNv0aa	Hola, por lo que leo noto que eres una persona joven y que aun mas joven siendo casi una ni?a pasastes por una experiencia demasiado fuerte y dolorosa, con esa edad de 16 anos es cuando mas necesitabas el amor y los consejos de tus padres para poder encaminar bien tu vida. Para colmo quizas por la falta de ellos te comprometistes con alguien y tuvistes una ni?a, sin saber hasta que punto es de serio y el compromiso tan grande que se debe asumir cuando ya tenemos hijos. No es menos cierto que cuando pasamos por la experiencia de la infidelidad aunque lleguemos a tratar de reaser nuestras vidas siempre nos queda la duda y creemos que todos van a ser iguales. Puede ser que de pronto te toque otra persona así pero eso no quiere decir que todo el mundo es igual. Hay personas que te llegan a amar y son incapaces de pagarte con una infidelidad. Creo que debes de buscar ayuda con un terapista pues no se puede vivir siempre a la expectativa de que vas a ser enga?ada, Además por lo que escribes de que te sientes poca cosa siento que tienes la auto estima por el suelo, esto hace que te deprimas y sientas que nada te sale bien, si no te levantas y te sientes igual a los demás jamas vas a conocer la felicidad, piensa siempre que tu te mereces sentirte realizada. Haz algo que no sea solo la casa o el esposo, estudia o trabajo en algo que te llene y no cierres tu mundo solo para una persona. Piensa bien que tienes una nena de la cual regocijarte, que es saludable, que Dios te bendijo dejando que tu la trajeras al mundo. Cuantas personas no hay que quieren tener uno y no pueden o les sale enfermo o lo pierden. Recuerda siempre que el amor va y viene pero los hijos siempre son nuestros y ese compromiso es indestructible.|`|b1367cfa5ce9d92deadf47122437ece4aa	Yo considero que seria muy importante que busques ayuda porque si podria haber algo por ahi que te esta lastimando aunque tu pienses que no es asi podria ser que en tu inconsinte hay algo.... La infidelidad es algo muy fuerte y no tan facil lo superas sola.<br>  <br>  Piensalo primero que nada por ti y despues por tu hija porque para que ella este bien primero tu como su mama tienes que estar al 100%

Al dia siguiente le regale a mi amiga una de las mu?equitas que me habian traido. <br>  Los Reyes y Santa son una manera de recordar lo hermoso que es dar sin recibir nada a cambio.<br>  Los reyes siguieron llegando hasta que empezaba en la facultad...

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Pienso que ella está siendo desleal contigo y no la mereces como amiga, ella te utilizo para conocer a tu hermano, te pidió el número de su celular y luego cambio. Púes dejala tranquila a ver que pasa, no la busques y te acordaras de mí, que si no llega a nada serio con tu hermano, ella solita te irá a buscar. Solo tu sabrás si disculparla o no, ya que el que la hace una vez, la hace dos y varias veces. No mendigues su amistad, la amistad es algo muy bonito y es imperdonable que la rompamos por nada. Tu por lo visto eres excelente amiga por la forma como hiciste la pregunta, se te siente desesperada. Quedate tranquila no la acoses ni busques, ya tu hermano te puso el altavoz del teléfono. Entonces, que quieres? más bien preguntale a tu hermano si tiene algo con ella, si no te quiere decir nada. Dejalo así, apartate y sigue tu camino que ella en algún momento te buscara. Suerte y sigue como eres y que valoren tu amistad, con esas personas son con las que debes de estar, no con las que traicionan o dejan de valorarte como amiga. Lo que no nos deja nada positivo en la vida, se APARTA.

Ya viví algo así por eso opino.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Me encanta esa pregunta que haces, ya que a mi me paso algo que duró cuatro a?os de mi vida, una relación a distancia. Pienso, en lo particular, que si los dos se aman en realidad puedan buscar la manera de reunirse y no dejar que la distancia y el tiempo acaben con ese amor.Hay la posibilidad que por más que él te quiera se le presente otra en carne y hueso, es decir no espiritualmente, por telefono o por chat y que el se enamore de la otra que tiene al frente y que le puede dar todo lo que tú no le das. Es decir, tal vez el sienta amor por tí, sentimiento, feeling, conección, pero falta algo más y es lo físico que es esencial para todo ser humano y por más que amemos y no busquemos la oportunidad de encontrarnos frente a frente, pueden pasar muchas cosas. Como te mencione anteriormente que él encuentre a otra o tu misma encontrar a otro. Por eso te aconsejo trata de buscar la manera de que se encuentren y ver que tanto se aman. Lucha por ese amor ya que como dice el refran....AMOR DE LEJOS, AMOR DE CUATRO o bien AMOR DE LEJOS...AMOR DE PENDEJOS.....De todas maneras te deseo la mejor de las suertes y que lleguen a cristalizar ese amor, ya que se de algunas parejas que se han conocido por internet y son de diferentes paises y han logrado unirse. Es algo relativo, esta en juego tus sentimientos y los de la otra persona. Bueno esta es mi respuesta y espero te haya ayudado de algo. SUERTE|`|125558e67b758568d8c7755695df27a5aa	Me gusto lo que dijeron arriba ..."dejate llevar sin dar nada a cambio" tomalo muy en cuenta que yo lo trato de hacer. Yo pase o estoy pasando algo asi hace 2 a?os no miro a mi ex novio pero siempre hablamos por telefono y bueno antes cuando estabamos juntos era bien seco conmigo y ahora es super lindo y me dice que me adora, q me ama etc y antes para que me lo dijera era pq taba pasando un milagro. <br>  Yo no vivia tranquila pensando q hacia,con quien, que iba a conocer a alguien y me iba a olvidar bueno en fin todo lo negativo...era horrible vivir asi hasta que un dia me di cuenta que ya no podia mas pos me aleje de el por un tiempo y bueno luego el me llamo despues de varios meses y hasta el dia de hoy mantenemos comunicacion y bueno yo lo amo y el dice lo mismo pero sabes a lo que mas tenia miedo me sucedio...el cuando me volvio a buscar estaba viviendo con otra chava y yo no lo supe hasta que sus amigos me contaron y bueno sigue con ella y el ya me conto y aunque yo se que soy una tonta por seguir queriendolo aunque el este con ella pues no tengo derecho a exigirle nada si en realidad no somos pareja. El es el que me busca y bueno aunque trato de olvidarlo sus palabras me hacen no poder olvidarlo y tener la esperanza de estar con el de nuevo algun dia. Sabes por mas que un chavo te quiera y exista confianza el hombre es mas debil que la mujer y el hombre se siente solo y busca compa?ia no precisamente pq exista amor sino para no sentirse solo, mientras que la mujer se siente sola pero sigue esperando sola. No te digo que sean todos los casos pero la verdad que la distancia mata la relacion por mas amor que exista y aunque me duela decirlo pq yo soy de  las que me aguanto que mis amigos me miren como loca cuando yo sigo esperando volver a ver a esa persona. Lucha por tu relacion, nada es imposible ok...bye|`|3ffdeb313ccc92d88f2aec9154059818aa	Bueno miedo a que la otra persona te valla a ser infiel , a que se sienta solo y desee a otra persona a su lado , a que te mienta , y así a muxas cositas mas , pero si existe la confianza y de verdad te quiere o esas personas a distancia se quieren no debería haber temores ( aunq eso es de una posibilidad de 1000000000/1 jeje)|`|7e9bdcabda42ae4a0917da18e3b887a2aa	a que te pinten el cuerno como me hicieron a mi|`|DuqThL3Xaa	Precisamente a eso.............

Yo conocí a mi ex en internet, el era de otra ciudad (9 horas de distancia) y yo fui la primera en ir a su ciudad,el encuentro fue muy padre y nos veíamos cada mes, una vez iba yo y la otra venía el, pero la relación duro un poco menos de un a?o, te aconsejaría que fueras y lo planearas junto con a ver que le parece la idea pero no vayas a caerle de sorpresa por que igual y no pueda atenderte en ese fin de semana.<br>  <br>  Cuidate y mucha suerte!!|`|05329446cbb9d41ab49c5a9158fd226baa	Hola... Amiga ciertamente te recomiendo que no des ningún paso, por que eso de conocer gente por la Internet es muy peligroso y no sabes con quien puedas estar hablando tan solo tienes 1 mes y no lo conoces a profundidad, te recomiendo que solo lo dejen para hablar como vienen haciéndolo, por la Internet no te recomiendo que salgas a buscar a alguien que no conoces, recientemente escuche de un caso de una chica que se fue a ver con un hombre de la Internet y el tipo después de varias salidas "La Mato" el caso causo mucho dolor aquí en Venezuela puesto que ella era de aquí. No te aconsejo que busques pareja por la Internet. ?Suerte!|`|64dab9dfc8fbe2f537aabc9af2b9d3d8aa	mira amiga si puedo llamarte asi, claro que si el es importante para ti y sabes donde localizarlo si sa tu el primer paso, te voy a contar algo no se de donde tu seas pero espero conozcas mi  novio es de Guadalajara y yo de Michoacan, nos conocimos en USA  y cuando viajamos cada quien para su estado, el no tenia mi direccion alla pero yo si tenia la suya, asi que yo le escribi y el me llamo y continuamos nuestra relacion, asi que te aconsejo que si el es muy importante para ti y sabes como localizarlo dale una linda sorpresa y entonces sabras si para el tu tambien eres importante, creo que esa es la prueba de fuego.

No lo tomes tan personal, quizá solo es por ganas de molestar, o bueno, tmb algo que he notado es que luego no sé, los argentinos dicen que nuestro futbol es malo y todo, no digo que esté mal, al contrario es su punto de vista y se respeta, pero aquí como que todo mundo se toma las cosas muy a pecho, y los mexicanos empiezan a decir que toda latinoamerica está muerta de hambre y así...<br>  <br>  Creo que es falta de tolerancia e inmadurez de quienes dicen eso|`|JI7MX3Gdaa	En todos los paises hay ricos y pobres y la riqueza o pobreza de una persona generalmente no depende del país en que resida, el que es bueno en los negocios lo va a ser aquí y en China y el que es wey en los bussines igual, no te deberías sentir ofendido siempre va a haber gente intolerante ya sea en México, argentina, checoslovaquia, etc<br>  Lo que no se puede negar es que el ingreso percapita de México esta por encima del ingreso percapita de los países sudamericanos.|`|UAhJuhiJaa	Soy Orgullosamente Mexicano, como cualquier otro puede estar orgulloso del pais en que nacio, odio la discriminacion y estoy agradecido de tener un trabajo que me da para mantener decorosamente a mi familia.<br>  <br>  Desgraciadamente en mi pais como en cualquier otro, existen personas que gozan agrediendo e insultando a personas menos afortunadas que ellos, esto esta en su naturaleza y es dificil de cambiar, pero en lo que a mi respecta ofrezco mi amistad a cualquier persona que quiera aceptarla sin importar la nacionalidad e ideologia, las fronteras no deberian de existir, ni nosotros deberiamos ensancharlas, que tengas un buen dia.|`|yr3cOz8Naa	mira creo k todos estamos luchando por una vida mejor... no se a cuantos mexicanos abras oido pero no creo k seamos la mayoria, ni siquiera al 1 %... yo soy mexicana y a mucho orgullo, los mexicanos somos trabajadores.. de hecho yo tengo familiares en los estados unidos k estan tratando de superarse... el mundo de hoy en dia no esta para andar con ofensas ni mucho menos sino para trabajar y para todos hay en esta vida sabiendo trabajar... ademas claro k hay pobreza en este pais.. pero tambien hay riqueza de sentimientos por eso te invito a k no hables por todos los mexicanos k en la gran mayoria somos gente de bien y de buenos sentimientos.. saludos y suerte|`|4d2e129d20fe21c54b028583f850782aaa	Solo quiero decirte que aunque se lee algo gracioso eso de "ofendedoras" no se dice asi se dice OFENSIVAS.....take care|`|GZzdhzLEaa	Ojalá fuera cierto que los mexicanos tuvieramos más dinero que muchos países, no solo los de latinoamérica, me parece que esa idea la tienen las personas que no comprenden ni conocen de realidades (en 2006 se hablaba en México de 49 millones de pobres) y solo son informados por la televisión (la de México es asquerosa), la creencia debe venir de nuestra triste cercanía con los gringos y, tal vez de que el empresario 2o más rico del mundo es de aquí, pero yo invito a quienes te han dicho eso que se acerquen a ver los alrededores de la merced, la candelaria, algunas zonas de Nezahualcoyotl o Chimalhuacán, por no decir zonas rurales o comunidades indígenas, para que se sigan dando ínfulas de riquillos. En mi país hay una comunidad argentina muy importante, tienen muchos a?os aquí y nadie les ha regalado nada, les ha costado mucho trabajo tener lo que tienen y hacer lo que hacen,  quienes dicen esas cosas de los hermanos argentinos en México deberían ponerse a pensar que lo que nosotros más exportamos es mano de obra ilegal (gracias a infinidad de gobiernos que jamás se preocuparon por ellos y que tampoco lo hacen por nosotros, les importa más enriquecer transnacionales y empresarios ambiciosos) y que nos ofende el trato que la mayoría de ellos reciben en EEUU o acaso ?nos gusta lo que dicen de los indocumentados en ese país?. Soy mexicano y me ofende darme cuenta que nosotros en ocasiones somos más clasistas e incluso racistas que aquellos a quienes siempre criticamos. Que triste que por algunos irracionales se tenga el concepto que se tiene de la mayoría de los mexicanos que no pensamos así.|`|tVd6da9Gaa	Empezando, soy mexicano, y estoy conciente de la actitutd que mencionas puesto que he sido testigo de ello, y  no la apruebo ni la justifico. Ahora, la arrogancia mexicana, debo aclarar, es unicamente con los paises sudamericanos puesto que, de todo america, somos los segundos en importancia economica y eso es solo por nuestra cercania con los Estados Unidos, no por otra cosa. <br>  El que nos lleguen más dolares que al resto de los paises de America tambien tiene un porque y es simplemente por que gran parte de la poblacion mexicana se va a trabajar a estados unidos y envian una buena cantidad de dinero en remesas que casi llega a compararse con el producto interno bruto del país.<br>  Lamentablemente los mexicanos somos admiradores de los fuertes, solemos tratar bien a los extranjeros siempre y cuando los veamos para arriba como a los estadounidenses o europeos, pero en cuando X mexicano detecta que X persona esta por debajo de su media economica lo empieza a tratar mal y sea extranjero o mexicano tambien le aplicara la misma tecnica de "como te veo, te trato"<br>  México es un país bello, con futuro pero tiene un problema y es el mexicano, lo siento, es mi pais, y lo amo, pero como sociedad vamos en picada.<br>  <br>  Aclaración importante: No todos los mexicanos somos tan malos, al contrario, somos una sociedad más bien contrastante, como en todos lados y en todos paises|`|wKg26wGJaa	Amigo,<br>  Que triste que tengas esa mala impresion de nosotros los mexicanos. <br>  Como en todo el mundo hay gente que se cree superior a los demas, pero la gran mayoria somos gente que amamos nuestras raices latinas y respetamos por igual al resto de la gente, sea de donde sea.<br>  El dinero no importa, yo tengo la fortuna de conocer a gente extremadamente humilde de Mexico, Colombia, Brasil y Guatemala, y digo fortuna porque nunca he visto gente con mejores sentimientos y eso es lo que nos hace importantes. No de donde somos, no cual es nuestra posicion economica y no en donde vivimos o trabajamos.<br>  Tambien tengo la mala suerte de conocer gente con dinero y sin dinero que te tratan con la punta del pie (muy mal) y que solo les interesa sacar provecho sin agradecer o apreciar nada ni a nadie.<br>  Una disculpa por las experiencias que te han llevado a tan triste opinion.<br>  Sinceramente,<br>  Jess - Mexicana|`|xdCH9DHqaa	mira creo que mal entiendes el termino simplemente creo que aqui en Mexico solemos hacer menos o confiar mas en extranjeros que en nuestros mismos paisanos te voy a poner un ejemplo en los equipos de futbol estan lo chavitos que juegan desde fuerzas basicas sin embargo que pasa prefieren contratar a un extranjero en  vez de darle una oportunidad a los jovenes y de ahi el comentario porque sinceramente luego llega cada extranjero que mas que hacerle un bien nos friega mas pero no lo tomes a mal|`|ywo6fI62aa	Oye, yo soy mexicana y te entiendo...<br>  <br>  no es nuestra culpa de ser el patio trasero de EU ??<br>  <br>  si apenas vamos "saliendo economicamente", pero como pais no estamos tan "ricos" al contrario dependemos de EU y lo poco que exportemos a otros paises y de lo mucho que importamos para trabajar.<br>  <br>  yo respeto mucho a paises sudamericanos como argentina y urugay que tienen los primeros lugares en educacion en el mundo...aqui somos super incultos!!! jajajaja<br>  <br>  por cierto, yo nunca he escuchado a un mexicano decir que somos ricos!!! jajajaja ya quisieramos<br>  <br>  La verdad deberias de enterarte un poquito mas de las noticias de México.<br>  <br>  Y no te enojes, no todos los mexicanos somos asi.<br>  <br>  suerte =)

Que él te escogió a ti como esposa y pareja, que antes que su madre viviera con ustedes les iba mejor. Que tu no deberías estar sufriendo por culpa de tu suegra que hasta te ha puesto de enemiga de su hermano y tu cu?ada. Que piense que va hacer si quedarse con su madre, hermano y cu?ada o contigo. Que la pareja es de DOS y no de TRES. Que tú has hecho lo imposible por llevártela bien con tu suegra pero ella tiene celos y no te acepta, que por todo pelea hasta el extremo de inventar cosas como lo del herbalife y llorar para traerte problemas con él. Que deje ya ese cordón umbilical que lo une a su madre. Que piense que antes se la llevaban mejor sin ella. Que decida ella o tú. Pero también amiga, deberías quererte más tú. Si casi empezando la relación de casados tienes esos problemas con tu suegra, que podrás esperar para más adelante. Piensa bien lo que vas hacer. Primero tú y después los demás. Imagínate si sales embarazada, aún tienes tiempo de tomar una buena decisión para ti. Ya que tu esposo solo está pensando en su familia y no en ti. Dile que ya tu eres su familia, esposa, amante y que no te está dando el puesto que tú te mereces. Suerte.<br>  P.D. Qué tú no le estas pidiendo que deje a su madre y familia, pero que sepa distinguir entre madre, hermano, cu?ada y quien de verdad es su esposa y la mujer que compartirá el resto de sus días.

Tienes razón al decir que a veces toman el matrimonio como la firma de un documento o como un contrato que se hace entre dos personas. Pero, yo pienso que no es así, es como la consolidación legal del amor entre dos personas. Claro está, es una ley impuesta por la mano del hombre, en el amor no deberían de existir esas cosas, pero, pienso que por los hijos que puedan venir dentro de esa unión sería lo más lógico casarse para que ellos nazcan siendo legítimos y no fuera de una unión en concubinato, es decir, una unión no constituida. Y me parecería muy lindo que también esa unión sea bendecida ante los ojos de Dios. También es como cierta seguridad y más respeto en el matrimonio. Ya que cuando se vive en concubinato la mujer está más expuesta que el hombre la deje al primer problemita que tengan y si están casados, lo pensará dos o tres veces antes de hacerlo. Pero es relativo, respeto las uniones libres, pero también a los que deseen casarse.|`|yGdoeDkRaa	siento que es demasiada responsabilidad, pero observo a mis amigos casados y los veo tambien con muxia felicidad y sobre todo  veo que podra faltar, sentir que no pueden ver hacia adelante ni volver atras y sinembargo al ver a su lado saber que se tienen el uno al otro. asi que no creo que sea algo tan atroz.<br>  <br>  en lo personal nunca me casare no esta en mis planes. desde que tenia 15 a?os y empeze a planear mi vida no lo considere, a los 17 a?os me propusieron matrimonio y tuve que decidir entre casarme o estudiar la universidad y decidí actualmnte soy medico tengo 24 y sigo conservando mi manera de pensar, me gusta mi libertad y sobre todo amo mi profesion.|`|62b52d27b948759149bf880d8a471e5caa	Es una responsabilidad muy grande|`|Gu48VGziaa	Yo sue?o encontrar a mi alma gemela, sería suficiente para mi sin importar papeles de por medio. <br>  El matrimonio puede verse desde diferentes perspectivas:<br>  1.

Em00pBjTaa	okay so my boyfriend of 16 months farts all the time.<br>  but i would never fart in front of him because i thought he would think it was nasty or something. but one time, pretty recently actually, he farted when he was over at my house. and i had been holding one in for a while so i was like oh yeah? and i farted right after him. and he totally just laughed it off. He thought it was funny, not disgusting. <br>  don't worry about what he thinks. If he thinks you're nasty because you fart, then he's really immature. Everyone does it. :P<br>  just be yourself and he'll love you anyway. <br>  <br>  hope my story helped!

If you and play fight, for example, let one rip in the middle of it. Watch his reaction. Chances are, if you've been together this long, he'll just think it's the most hilarious thing and may even tease you about it a bit. On a serious note, he's aware of bodily functions the same way you are. He farts, burps and craps just like everyone else does and it doesn't always smell or sound wonderful. Guys tend to care less in general about this stuff than girls do anyway. So as a general rule: if he farts in front of you without batting an eye, poops even if you're hanging out with him at his place/poops at your place, and burps in front of you,  you're clear to do the same (within reason of course).|`|XCvQnantaa	Honestly if my girlfriend farted I'd be real sarcastic and call her nasty and such, it depends on how much he likes you  and his sense of humor <br>  <br>  answer mine please! <3 <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkZZg6gtctb0lSV9kFYjJoDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227174606AATef6j">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Ys3IRu7Xaa	It's a great thing to be comfortable around your bf and fart when you can, but it's not something you should do.

6NbFy1KPaa	Welcome to the club sweetie; Fag Hags Anonymous.  Unfortunately, the prognosis of this friendship is not good.  I had the same thing happen to me and when he came out he really came out.  He turned into a woman and it was pitiful and disgusting.  But the thing that broke the camels back for me and my ex-best friend was when he kissed my man.  Girl jealousy runs deep on men who want to be women.  Watch out.  And I'm sorry you lost your best friend.  I lost mine too.<br>  <br>  I suggest you be supportive but realize that the relationship will change. Finally don't compromise who you are to remain his friend.  Stay true to yourself.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	do your mom!|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Well that stinks!!!!|`|dd6rgtL7aa	lol. I can only imagine how shocking that was for you.<br>  <br>  But, seriously - if you're happy for him, thats great. Just bring it up that it shocked you. No big deal. It will open up conversation and you can ask him other things, too. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Drop down on your knees and give praise to the lord you just saved another one.........cheers|`|PUUXbVK2aa	the same thing happened to me.<br>  i loved this boy for 3 years, and he told me he was gay one night.<br>  <br>  i got over it quickly, i felt so trusted and special that i was the first person he told, that he felt we were that good of friends to tell me.|`|rpHJ7OIKaa	call him a ******<br>  and laugh at him|`|GIXwJWfvaa	support him, hes your best friend..<br>  just be by his side throughout it because<br>  if he told you, he obviously trusts you(:.|`|AA10415165	I think he wants your acceptance, so you should give it to him. I mean really, if you were really his friend and had feelings for him, you'd be happy that he trusts you enough to tell you. And it's not like that won't happen a ton of times. All the gay guys seem so perfect. You should just be there for him.|`|MZMwJwDGaa	dang thats deep, support him|`|gCptw4gMaa	Wow, sorry about that. Now you'll never know what could have been.  Just act normal.Keep him as a friend and keep searching for that guy who's out ther for you.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	tell him you like him and see his reaction. but hes gay so =/|`|9alN3sCTaa	why do u have to do anything?|`|AA10041941	You were his friend before so continue being his friend.. he'll need you now more than ever.. just please know that he is gay and that he just isn't into you in that sort've way, I know its hard.. I had a similar situation happen to me in College but I was actually DATING the guy when he came out to me, so it was hard...but the best thing is to remain his friend..a true friend would do that and no matter what just let him know you love and accept him for who he is! I know its hard girl to care for someone so much but can't have them but in the end you'll find the perfect guy for you and in the mean time it'll be totally fun to have him as a friend even more now.. just imagine all the fun you can have at the mall scoping out all the cute guys! ;)|`|WN1P2qvhaa	still tell him how you really felt. but tell him after you say that is great and everything that he came out of the closet.|`|kD0zNJLqaa	well try to treat him the same <br>  ask him to hang out<br>  be his friend<br>  dont stop being his friend|`|AA12380526	Nothing. Just be his friend. <br>  <br>  You say you're happy that's he's fine with who he is, but it seems you're not happy.  But that's what happens when you have a best friend, and you're supposed to only be friends, but you secretly have feelings for.  You were so caught up in your fantasy about him, you didn't see the clues that would have told you he is gay.  That's why you were shell-shocked.  You'll get over it and hopefully meet a straight guy to date.|`|rcQgfKPTaa	omg thats hard<br>  just accept t or atleast dnt tell him u feel all weird about it.<br>  in the future  guys will laugh bout the fact that u had a crush on him.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	I guess romance is not part of what you do> so except him as a friend and see how he changes know that he has come out>|`|DSpbDItUaa	well it could be a phase or he could not be the one for you you'll find him eventually|`|9EW08emXaa	Wow. If he trusted you to tell you, you should totally be there for him.  Help him out and listen to him if he needs to talk.

LOL  He might find that funny.)|`|1hbUCmpJaa	the good ones are either gay or taken it sux|`|VZFEB85Iaa	Just stay friends with him.  He's still the same person as he's always been.  He may not ever be in a relationshio with you, but you should never stop being friends.  Though, I don't understand why he didnt just say he was gay over the phone.|`|O0sbEqi5aa	he could turn straight or at least bio for you<br>  if he likes you|`|28ace4b478f0d1936cd87055ad9fff5eaa	Call him and say you were totally surprised by his news, but now you want to congratulate him for his decision. And thank him for taking the trouble to tell you of his decision.|`|09c8f2aa42f6255f80371d12edbfa7f6aa	You should tell him that you like and accept him just the way he is and that you are flattered that he chose to share this information with you.  It's a pretty big deal to come out, and it sounds like it's important to him. He would only share this with you like this if he really likes you.<br>  <br>  I've had this happen twice, and while it is frustrating on one level, it also helps to understand the mixed signals - that he likes you but it never goes anywhere.

Either he won't mind that you like him a lot (make sure to tell him you felt this way BEFORE he told you he was gay - otherwise, he'll think you're trying to make him straight again) and he'll still be friends. Or he will take you in as his girl crush. Good luck with this. In hind-sight, this will probably be a hilarious moment to look back on.

El perdón no es el que te piden, es el que tu concedes porque quieres seguir adelante sin llevar a cuestas una pesada carga. Cuando estás dispuesto a perdonar, es porque eres suficientemente maduro para seguir.<br>  Eso no quiere decir que: sigas con la misma persona, continúes en una relación que no tiene sentido, vuelvas a confiar en alguien que te defraudó o sigas amando a quien te hizo da?o.<br>  Si continúas en una relación, el perdón tiene que ser acompa?ado del olvido.

AA10797627	Desde ahorita tienes que buscar tu mejor opción en cuanto a la persona que va a llevar tu caso. Yo al principio contraté a un abogado para que me ayudara, pero ese abogado me pidió muchísimo dinero y me pedía muchos tipos de documentos para poder iniciar mi papeleo con inmigración. Despues un buen tiempo decidí que mejor iba a buscar otra persona para que llevara mi caso y entonces contraté a una consultora, la cual me pidió muy poquitas cosas, mucho menos dinero y me ayudó bien rápido a tener listo mi paquete de documentos para enviarlos a inmigración. Pero si, lo importante es que visites muchos despachos y te entrevistes con la mayor cantidad de abogados y consultores posible, para que puedas elegir la mejor opción para ti. Y cuando ya estés casada, no dejes que pase el tiempo sin arreglar tu situación, porque entre más tiempo pasa, más dificil podría volverse después.<br>  No especificas si entraste legal o ilegalmente al pais, pero en caso de haber entrado ilegal, el tiempo de espera para que inmigración te de respuesta sobre el pedido de visa (que es lo primero que debes pedir antes de poder pedir algo más) es de 6 meses. Si ya tienes la visa y quieres convertirte en residente legal, entonces creo que el tiempo de espera es de 1 a 3 a?os, dependiendo de lo complicado de tu caso. Y ya para cuando puedas sacar la ciudadanía son 3 a?os de residencia para que puedas hacerlo.<br>  Espero que te haya servido la información (n_n)<br>  P.D.: Y no te creas de nadie que diga que ya con solo casarse ya puedes ser ciudadana, porque despues del 9/11 las leyes se hicieron más rigidas y ahora si hay que hacer mucho trámite para poder hacerse ciudadano.|`|0fc3a2b68675dcf6622b51f54070247faa	Una ves estés casada el debe pedir a las autoridades de inmigración la legalización de tus papeles.|`|27fc6ed981b1baeefc680225fa8ed35daa	mi opinión es que al casarte con el luego luego el tiene que tramitar tus papeles y luego de 6meses levan a dar un permiso de trabajo y luego al ano le dan la residencia después de 3anos puede ella aplicar por la ciudadanía estadounidense claro ese fue mi caso todos los casos cambian consulta un buen abogado de emigración  de pende en donde estés tu  en mexico o usa  los casos cambian y suerte|`|54c252b378a1b6f367a6e36270de6ba1aa	el proceso para hacerte ciudadana americana es algo tardado no es tan fácil como se cree primero te haces residente y con el tiempo adquieres la ciudadanía pero ese proceso puede durar hasta 6 a?os al casarte con una persona de nacionalidad americana automáticamente puedes tramitar la residencia pero la ciudadanía es a?os mas tarde|`|aaf044ff698feb96a9d3ac7e122e9661aa	antes solo era casarse y listo ahora las reglas han cambiado encuentra los detalles en univisionpuntocom calve inmigracion|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Ningún trámite, solo casarse e inmediatamente adquieres la nacionalidad norteamericana.

And there are probably many that you don't know about!  A user/loser will always find a soft touch until they hear the word "NO" in repetition and then realize that you have caught on to their scam.  The question is - You know her car is a piece of crap, but how long has EVERYONE ELSE known it is a piece of crap and stopped bailing her out and that is why she is phoning you?

Dont be discouraged, go out and have fun and you'll get your kiss|`|6e2p7fjXaa	yeahh go us *high five* hehe i havent either...its perfectly fine :)|`|5484cad80389b6734bd30e6766d7f195aa	not really normal, but life doesnt revolve around guys|`|JOcfZgDiaa	dont worry, you are completly normal.  the same thing happened to me.  it gets scarier the longer you wait though because any guy will expect you to know how to kiss because of your age.  but you could just be flat out honest with the first guy that you are about to kiss.  he may think it is sweet that you are so "fresh."  I mean guys like virgins, so why wouldnt they like to be your first kiss, right.  but make sure it is with someone special, because you can never get that very first kiss back.  and if he never talks to you again after (which is what happened to me, but dont let that worry you) dont let it get you down, it just means he is a jerk.  <br>  and if you are anything like me, any first kiss with any guy will be nerve racking.  even after you get the practice.  <br>  good luck girl, and be confident.|`|JuoHnUfOaa	Yes its relatively normal.<br>  I'm 20 and I've never been kissed.

AA11660242	Hi. Well, you're boyfriend obviously doesn't care enough for you, so the first thing you should do is leave him. Pornography is poison for the mind. It alters and corrupts the mind, so his thoughts and actions are tainted with it's disturbing filth. As for your two friends that are after you, I would hold off on them both. If you have some jail time to serve, then I would get that out of the way. It's probablly not the advice that you want to hear, but if you start your life with one of your two friends first, what's gonna happen when you get arrested all of a sudden? Your relationship and life is going to take a huge impact and going to suffer. Get the jail time out of the way, and use the time in prison to think things over. Whenever you get out, if your two friends are still after you, then be very careful which one you want to go with. That's a decision that you'll have to take on your own. Just be sure to put yourself first, and don't try to sell yourself to them. Let them sell themselves to you. Good luck!|`|ibaLRXY2aa	As I've stated in another question, this is Marriage and Divorce, not Teenage Angst (or 20-something Angst).

You both (well, you, not so much him) need to slow dow and regroup. Make a list of what is important to you in life. He can pay all the bills while you find another job? Look on the bright side as well as the negative while you are making the decision. It is very irresponsible to be in a relationship and also thinking of getting with possibly two other guys so you can meet your basic hierarchy needs. That is why I say slow down. I know you said you won't cheat but you have one foot on a banana peel. Sit down and talk to your guy. Sorry to say but guys look at porn. Just something men and a lot of chicks do. It is an addiction. Its not GOOD but a lot of people feel your same pain. Pray for direction and patience. Godspeed.|`|o8eiUs1iaa	you shouldnt have to deal with that, get rid of him, find someone that doesnt look at porn all the time, thats an insult to you, think highly of yourself and come to terms with the fact that he is a loser and you deserve better|`|Lv0zjgGIaa	Get out if you start cheating where will it get you.

AA11880026	are you out of your mind go to sleep
dpk9n2SSaa	No. I am totally against credit for rings. If you can't afford it, get one you can buy with cash. My diamond engagement ring was a very small stone. Just this past November, I finally got an expensive ring after 21 years of marriage! A $100 diamond is just fine. It served its purpose and it is not about the diamond, but about the love. My husband kept promising that he would buy me a better one and he finally did when he could afford it!|`|HcboXOmjaa	I think using credit is a good idea for those who don't have enough money to pay for it all at once.  Many jewelers offer great financing deals where there is no interest for 6-12 months after purchase.  My bf just got a Kay's card so he is planning on using it I'm sure. We have talked about it and he definitely will be paying my ring off in small payments.  It's especially a good idea for those who don't have very much money now, but will in 6-12 months so they can pay it off before interest starts.  My bf has an internship this summer, so he will easily be able to pay it off before interest starts. He's in school right now so he's not making a whole lot of money.|`|63439e5b52d40d8694adad7cd7a9c505aa	Bought on credit. Paid off balance on the first billing cycle.  Reason was to actually save money, we get cash back bonuses and points towards rewards.  I think it is fine if it will be paid in full within a couple of months, but anything longer not so much.  Who wants to go into debt because of a ring?|`|Emw1PBqXaa	Store Credit at DiamondMart was 0% financing for 12 months.|`|zHX9tlnWaa	Mine was bought with cash. Neither of us have credit cards.|`|JC3pWOpKaa	lay a way|`|jOyzcJd7aa	We paid half in cash and half on the store credit card. Just another way to build up our credit...|`|mx3gFmIKaa	10 years ago my first engagement ring from my now husband was bought on credit.  The ring came from Gordon's, it cost 600 dollars, my husband paid 200, then had 400 to pay in 6 months interest free which he did.  We were both in school at the time.<br>  <br>  At our 5 year we upgraded, I kept the original ring, but we did get an emerald shape solitaire platinum set for 4700 dollars, paid cash|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Paid for the whole thing in cash as he had it saved up for a while.<br>  I am not against buying on credit if you can afford the repayments. They often have instore, no interest plans which I think are a very good option.<br>  My fiance is very much a credit person, because he is crap at saving, but great at paying loans off quickly. I'm a cash person as I save for what I want before I buy it.<br>  Everyone is different.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	We paid cash for our ring.  Mostly because we decided that our budget would be determined by what we saved.  Also, we got a discount for paying cash.  <br>  <br>  I didn't want a ring we'd be paying for until after we got married!  We did some research and bought our ring from a place that allows us to upgrade through the years.  For special occassions, we will slowly upgrade the center diamond.  That way it's still sentimental, but we can save our pennies and only do what we can afford.  <br>  <br>  I generally think that credit cards are a bad idea, no matter what they're used for.  I steer clear of them except for vacations and such.  The stuff you buy on credit cards is not worth the stress you feel when you get your credit card bills.  And remember, you still have a wedding to pay for!|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Mines a bridal set and he paid cash.<br>  <br>   We've just put a deposit on his wedding band today, but I'll be going into the shop after payday and paying the balance on it- we were only intending to start looking today but really liked the ring and were able to get 50% off if we put a deposit on it today.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Nope all in cash.   (Tax refund lol)   I like it better that way.  <br>  <br>  In movies I never understood the guys who took out loans to buy a girl a 20,000 ring.  I'm thinking...Does she know she owes that money too if they get married haha.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	My ex didn't have good enough credit to qualify for payments so he bought my ring with cash.
AA11447210	Depends on the person being cheated on. Typically the cheater does it because they want to keep the marriage AND play around. It's the cheated-on party who usually decides if the marriage continues or not (after discovering the betrayal).<br>  <br>  I'd say, the % is higher that the marriage will end than that it will not. Sometimes it doesn't end right away, but down the road issues occur that can be traced back to the cheating and lack of trust after that.<br>  <br>  What the couple really needs to do is seek counseling and find out why the cheating occured in the first place. It's usually a symptom of a problem, rather than the problem itself.|`|9HtT0RiGaa	Not necessary. <br>  <br>  The root of the issue is always due to one or both spouses' ignorance of the other partner's deep concern and needs.<br>  <br>  With solution/solutions work out by both partners, the marriage would be back and even be rock solid. <br>  <br>  The keys are communication and willingness to face up to loss of pride.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	Most times if a person cheats it can sometimes mean the end of their marriage. I know different couples where one person cheats and they end up divorced. I also know other couples and one person cheated and they are still together.|`|elhcuN19aa	Yep<br>  for me it would be if she hid it|`|ma36UfpBaa	Even if it is emotional cheating it signifies something... I am just not sure if it signifies the end of a marriage. IMO people that cheat do it because they probably want out of the marriage, whether or not they will actually end it is a completely different story. I find that cheaters are usually very weak people. They don't have the courage to make their marriage either stand or fall. Instead they let their marriage be what it is (either because they won't change or their spouse won't change) and look outside to find what they are missing. It is hard for many that want their marriage to end because their are so many things to consider (kids, finances, etc.). I think becoming complacent and risking hurting lives is a poor choice by those that would rather sit on their excuses for why they stay... <br>  <br>  It should signify the end of a marriage, it would for mine!|`|naequcqlaa	No, not always!  It all depends on the situation & if you have any ideas that lead up to this happening.  IF there's a problem in your marriage, something you know can be worked on & worked out, then yes, you do have a chance.  If things are not good all around & have come to the point of not being able to "fix" anything, then things don't look that good for a positive result.  It all depends on the reason, the person, & just how bad things are.  IF a counselor would be of help, then by all means it's sure worth a try IF both parties are open to it.  Even talking to a clergy person could be of help.  Someone you know that just could be of help to you.  We're all human, & humans do make mistakes.  But there are possibilities things could be "repaired" if you're BOTH willing.  So IF you do think there's any chance of repairing things, by all means go for it, you sure have nothing to loose & everything to gain.  All the best to you...:)|`|5af8PNwxaa	I am not married, however if I were and loved my husband dearly and he cheated...I don't think I could forgive.<br>  <br>  Reason being, the person I am I would always be wondering what the other person was like, if they were going to cheat again, etc.   <br>  <br>  There would be a loss of 'trust' and once that goes and you cannot get it back, there is no way you could stay married.<br>  <br>  However, they are people who have cheated and worked out their marriage to live long happy lives together.<br>  <br>  It just depends on the people involved, if you are willing to forgive and forget.|`|AA11825142	That depends on a whole lot of things. How long you have been together. What type of relationship you have. Sometimes you hear that an affair brings a married couple closer and others well they end in divorce or the affair just continues. I don't condone cheating but if you have alot of time invested into this marriage and really love each other its worth trying to save.|`|1uRUaSblaa	No. If both parties are willing to forgive each other and put the irreversible past aside, the marriage can still work. It may be tough initially as trust has to be rebuilt. Still, it is possible for the marriage to go on.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	no, because there are many other things to consider with, after all, marriage is everything that you can imagine, it is not just simply sex or relationship or ....|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I'm still with my husband after he had an affair last year, so I have no clue.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	It's a good start Your at the end of your problems which end>|`|BlSA5SZXaa	yes of course it usually does.<br>  <br>  however, maybe before you reach "the end" why don't you first figure out WHY the spouse cheated? if it is because he/she were missing something from the marriage, then maybe that is something that can be worked on??<br>  <br>  obviously you always try to fix it before you end it however if the person really just wants out, then let it end.<br>  <br>  answers mine plz thnx<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsZ39jLPiKVm0lE79ANwRlfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227173742AA3HxyY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|KExssBP4aa	not necessarily.  if both of you are willing to forgive and work through it then the marriage doesn't have to end.  if you truely love each other then it's not the end of the world.|`|8KOcjy7Daa	not really is some cases it may actual make the marriage stronger and some spice to it. but please never admit to it .|`|ae869aee66b5dda023afec569c0d7d0caa	I don't think that I would be able to forgive my husband if he cheated on me. That would signify the end to me because an affair is not something that married people should engage in.|`|TTjDATeOaa	In my case yes, but the marriage was over in his mind long before we even started talking.|`|pkLD5r5Taa	It would for me!|`|aEpPt9koaa	I dont think that it does.  I would leave if my husband cheated on me but in most relationships I dont think ONE affair signifies the end of an marriage because most people are attached emotionally, physically, and financially in a marriage and are afraid or dont want to just break that bond.  But if the affairs continue then most people call it quits.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	not always, depends if the cheater comes to his senses and shows remorse, is sorry, and is willing to acknowledge what he did. if he was willing to let her know he knew that he hurt her by his actions. it would also depend on how long the affair had been going on, if he treated his wife badly while having the affair, or if he left his wife to be with the other woman. depends on his wife's willingness to forgive, and if she still loved him. but more or less once someone betrays u and shatters your trust its over with. sometimes they claim that affairs can make a marriage stronger. but i am sure its not the norm. it was an un remorseful affair that ended my marriage, but it could just as easily gone the other way had he shown one ounce of remorse or said he was sorry.
c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	I think it depends on who you are trying to date.  If you are a highly intelligent person and you are dating morons than yes, it would be very difficult. Likewise if you are of average intelligence and you are trying to date Einstein than it wouldn't be very easy.

You are not alone. But to make yourself feel much much better very soon you have to ACCEPT that he is GONE and he is no longer YOURS. When you realize this, your energy will be deflected away from him which will improve your daily feelings. You won't wake up and go to sleep with so much pain. Make your interactions with him all business. Don't be rude but cancel all emotion where he is concern. DO NOT express your love to him anymore. He's not your man anymore. Be for real and brutally honest with yourself. The actions and words he's used to express the fact that he is done with you, turn those into empowering strength by repeating to yourself, "I deserve being completely loved." "I know he'd never be faithful to just me, so I have moved on." "He doesn't care enough to care for me, so I am done." Things like this help you get the strength you need to get free.

But in the situation that you describe I think you and your kids are going to be better off.  The turmoil of two parents fighting takes a big toll on them and they learn some pretty bad behaviors because of them.  As you look back one day you will see how being so young had so much to do with what happened.  I know I have.  I wasn't prepared for the responsibilty of taking care of a house, I didn't know how to take care of a wife properly, I thought she was supposed to take care of me and other things.  When we are so young we think that we can change things to make them better and after we make a mistake we find we can't.  But that doesn't mean we can't move on.  The first step in getting past this is best described as having a death in the family, for something did die.  And with that comes a grieving period, up to six months, to get your head on straight and seeing things clearly again, to realize that you are not defined by this marriage.  You will then be in a better place and you will be able to be loved once more, but after the greiving.  One thing that worries me about what you said about what he said is that it is a little too close to what some guys use as a string someone along line.  I can't be with you but I will always love you.  It keeps you heart a hoping and your head a spinning.  Stay away from that, it will only cause a relapse in your grieving time.  It isn't easy, but you can do it.  You are working with one of man's strongest emotions, love, it will take time.  Be careful if you think he's been with other women, you don't know what STD's he can pick up.  write if you need some more support  good luck|`|KmdvAnSsaa	I know it must be hard but you have to respect him not thinking its a good idea getting back together.  You have 3 kids and you both need to pull together and raise them in a healthy environment .

I'm sorry for everything you are going through it is not easy but you need to focus on your children and their well being.|`|AA11825142	Well the first step is to admit to yourself that its really over, you said you were already divorced right and he is telling you that there is no chance?

She should do something for herself now that he has other plans. She can choose to tell on him and sever the relationship for good. Or she can just go along and let him treat her like a plaything, a doormat, or his backup and sink. <br>  You can choose to stand by her through thick and thin, and not do anything about this or you can do something for her, eg, tell on him, let his new girlfriend and her mom know what he has been doing to your friend. <br>  Good luck.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	You were not wrong, you were being a real friends. True friends are capable of telling each others truths without the risk of jeopardizing the friendship. You are seeing what's really going on here, she's too involved to see the wall she's about to hit!. <br>  <br>  I had a friend in a similar situation. With love and patience I was able to convince her she was better without him. She broke up their relationship, I called her every day, took her out, and made sure I was there for her. She met someone else and now she's been with him for 5 years. <br>  <br>  You are a real friend, make her see how illogic she is.|`|aeLyiRczaa	No, you are not wrong in the aspect of saying they should end it.  You were wrong for not telling her she is slutty and he is scum, long before you did say something.  But please, do not give us the nonsense about how he is treating her.  She is at least as bad as he is and in some respects, has little reason to be upset with him over anyone else.  She has shown her colors as he has.  Both of them are immoral people who really cannot cry foul, for they have no legitimate reason to do so.  Sort of the pot calling the kettle black thing in my view.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	not at all!! But if she doesn't see it, then you're wasting your energy.  you've said your peace, I'd just let it go. you know how this is going to end up. she doesn't.  you can't save her from hurt if she's so blind that she doesnt even see it coming.  sucks, but you have to just let it happen. you told her. she won't listen. so... let it go. be there for her when it blows up, but nothing more you can do.  <br>  <br>  to settle your own mind, maybe you should have one last talk to her and tell her exactly how you see it.  tell her that he's a user and he will never be the one for her.  once you get it all out, let it go.  she isn't going to "get" it until he breaks her totally.|`|ltXxNfwRaa	Absolutely not!!!  You did the right thing!  A real friend doesn't sugar coat anything and if the guy loved her, he would be married to her and not finding other girlfriends while he's married to someone else!!  The guy sounds like a douchebag and no offense to your friend, but she's not too bright if she's letting him take her money and has a wife and a new girlfriend.  I mean if she likes the idea of polygamy then more power to her but I think its retarded and I'd be saying something to the guys wife too while you're at it!!!|`|2UtKfF0kaa	How is that wrong?|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I am confused.  He is married.  And yet, he met a new GF whom he will marry her too?<br>  <br>  Anyway, as a good friend of her, you can tell her exactly what you think about him, but no more than twice.  <br>  <br>  After all, they both are adults.   They could be in a mutually dependent and satisfying relationship, which may look strange to outsiders.  But it's their own business and if they both are content with the way they are.<br>  <br>  Who are we to judge???|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	After 8 years and the latest edition of this story..

K5IOSGXAaa	Apparently your mom heard some bad stuff about you at school, from teachers or whoever. Look, your education is first and foremost so you have a future. You go to school to learn and get ahead in the world. Think of it as your job and you have to do your best or pay the consequences. Out in the real world adults who do a bad job get fired and end up living in a box. So concentrate on school first, do your work to the BEST of your abilities, if you need help on a subject get the help and spend the time. All of the other junk is second - friends, dramas, etc. Get your mind off that stuff and get your schoolwork in order. Or else you will be grounded until you are 21 LOL you don't want to live like that do you ???  then do the right thing.|`|5JumtCTGaa	awww i feel sorry for uuuu :((|`|PoHpSqwwaa	She can't treat you like **** forever.<br>  Once your 18 , she has no control over you..<br>  keep that in mind|`|QP8LdPLeaa	if you don't see the big deal in making a bad grade in spanish, then maybe you do need to be grounded. HOWEVER if you really tried your best, i think your parents are going overboard. parents always go overboard if they see a grade they don't like but the child has done all they can to pass it. show your mom this question, maybe she needs to realize what you are going through. she doesn't know whats going on at school. i think she needs to take a step back and listen to you before throwing the grounded option in your face,

anXcDspXaa	She probly likes you likes you/. I would ask her to be sure though.|`|GgEJ90FZaa	it sounds like she has a crush on you and doesn't know how to say it either. She is probably just as insecure as you are about the relationship. Keep doing what you are doing and if it goes any further it will happen naturally. Don't try to force the issue or think too hard on it. The perfect time for the first kiss will just happen. You do not have to do anything to make it happen. If it is just friendship, well, that too will become obvious. If it makes you too uncomfortable, sit down and have a chat explaining to her what her mixed signals are saying to you and how it's cool if she just wants to be friends but you are a man and her laying all over you makes you think of other things besides hanging out playing video games and to take it easy on you|`|evnGljdraa	I really don't know because I'm not her, but I would say more than a friend.  I know if I did all that it would man something serious...on the other hand though, I'm a pretty shy person.  She could just be that way.  Chances are, more than a friend, but I would let her make the moves, and just follow along until you are sure of things.|`|scbnqYjxaa	she probably does like you, and has realised that she has feelings for you in that 2month break that you gave her...<br>  <br>  it was a good thing you did, now she has realised what she has missed..<br>  63however go ahead and ask her whether she wants anything more than jus friendship>>>>><br>  <br>  GUD-LUCK|`|zNYyhjp3aa	I think she likes you more than just a friend, if you were only friends she wouldn't have invited you over for a movie and then fell asleep on your lap......|`|e5puBM1paa	she really likes you but is not sure how you feel about her.she wants you to make the first move.|`|d7f9bd0d1b3e11ca4112b0a2850869c7aa	awww, me thinks she likes you! if you like her, i think u shld ask her out, and she'll probly say yes.

ETgvd9Euaa	Some ideas from mine, but sorry no links....<br>  <br>  We hired a harpist to play during cocktail hour and dinner. It was beautiful, relaxing background music than was unobtrusive to conversations. For the 2+ hours she played the expense was well worth it.<br>  <br>  We were married in the Spring, and we were lucky that our florist also had a greenhouse. We bought the pots and they planted flowering plants in our colors to use not only as centerpieces, but they were the favors as well.<br>  <br>  We gathered wedding pictures from our families, from our grandparents to our siblings. Then we scanned them in to our computer, printed them out and framed them then scattered them around our cake table. This was our way of honoring the marriages that surrounded us as we grew up and today.<br>  <br>  As a salute to the women in our families - and my Mother in particular who had passed away 11 months before our wedding - I had my DJ call all the Mothers in attendance up to the dance floor and my flower girls gave them each a flower. Then we asked for someone - be it their child, the father of their children, or someone who knew them to be a good Mother, to come dance with them to 'Wind Beneath My Wings'. A very touching moment.<br>  <br>  We both had our brothers in the wedding party, so we asked them both to stand and give a humorous toast...well mine decided to get emotional so make sure you tell them FUNNY! lol<br>  <br>  We had rented a limousine 'bus' that was big enough to hold the entire wedding party. The ride from picture taking to reception venue was about 25 minutes so I surprised the gals with temporary rhinestone tattoos that we put on each others shoulders for some glitz. Being rhinestones they were hardly noticeable except up close or under the lights but we still felt a little 'wild' with them on.<br>  <br>  Think outside the box and you'll be able to personalize your wedding to reflect your personal taste.  Good Luck|`|dpk9n2SSaa	You can cater your own wedding with the help of some family members like at <a href="http://www.create-a-christian-wedding.com/weddingfingerfoodreception.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.create-a-christian-wedding.co...</a><br>  <br>  You can make original favors like baking cookies or making homemade candies.

(we are experts at that) lemme c, wut else, if u want a more forward approach, you could maybe walk up to her when shes alone, and then ask her, (SOFTLY and LIKE YOU MEAN IT! This guy walked up to me and asked if i liked him, but it sounded like he didn't like me so i said no and he really meant it, so this is REALLY important.) and also, make sure noone can hear you but her because if she is shy shell b ebarresed! i wish best of luck and hope it works out!
6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Estoy segura que si cuando a sido un amor verdadero, sutil y profundo. Yo particularmente amo a una persona que por circunstancias del destino tuvimos que separarnos y aún lo amo y sé que él a mí también. No se del futuro o si tal vez nos tropecemos en la vida nuevamente. Pero de algo estoy segura es que ese amor que siento por él, nunca morirá, lo llevare conmigo siempre a donde vaya a pesar de que me vuelva a enamorar y hasta casar. No sé pero pienso que el amor no muere si es verdadero y si los dos se aman, se guarda en un rinconcito del corazón por siempre. A  pesar de que no veas nunca más a esa persona.

Her having a boyfriend is evident that she is TRYING (even though not successful) to move on and forget about you.  If you are going to TN to get her back and replace the boyfriend toddles, do the dam thing, but if you are going to get back your friend just because you miss her, you will become a complication.  If you are a true friend, not wanting to be anything more, then give her this time.  Some relationships are not meant to survive outside influences.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying any of this to be rude, but to provide food for thought.  I have a friend that I've had for 30 years and we have NEVER been able to define our relationship, we come in and out of one anothers lives so often, but we never close the door.  The problem is, our relationship has no ending and that causes problems for our significant others and at times for us too.  Do you want to be singing this same song 30 years from now?  I will say I told you so now.  Best wishes.|`|796236e92a12bcc49a378a4de65ca0ddaa	Foolproof, I'm sure she'll soon see she's made a big mistake and come running back to you. (shrugs and shakes head).
ZDSlpy1Kaa	eiaculare almeno cinque volte a settimana, soprattutto in giovane età, porta ad una riduzione del rischio di cancro alla prostata fino al 65 per cento. Lo studio ha indicato inoltre che le eiaculazioni raggiunte tramite masturbazione sarebbero più efficaci per la prevenzione rispetto a quelle raggiunte in seguito alla penetrazione, perché in quest'ultimo caso potrebbero venire trasmesse malattie che aumentano il rischio di cancro.<br>  La masturbazione è genericamente considerata, soprattutto nella fase della pubertà, un mezzo per prendere confidenza con i cambiamenti del proprio corpo e acquisire familiarità e coscienza di sé, oltre che, ovviamente, un modo per ricavare puro piacere. In quest'ottica, di taglio psicologico-educativo, la conoscenza di sé derivante dalla masturbazione può costituire una buona base di partenza per ottenere un maggiore soddisfacimento anche nei rapporti con i partner.|`|k4N2SueAaa	no al massimo dovrà mettere a riposo la mano x qualche tempo,xò se diminuisce un po' è meglio|`|338930c5d370028a410f64b1d11a9870aa	ma che male e male ma per favore smettiamole con ste cazzate, la masturbazione non ha fatto mai male a nessuno tanto meno diventare ne ciechi ne calvi ne stronzate del genere, anzi ti diro di piu e una piacevole abitudine che in periodi di stress rilassa pure.|`|2496db653fda471dd644ab7da8823476aa	Diventerà cieco!|`|fc85ae670014b61597e593de54e6f93eaa	vivi e lascia vivere!----<br>  perché farlo smettere?---non danneggia la salute--|`|jtFfUTLsaa	se vuole gli presto la mungitrice.|`|8MaHe2aIaa	No, non fa male lascialo in pace!|`|HtLWCbFFaa	concordo non fa male ma fa skifo|`|OKaqzT3saa	ma tu sei un maschio o una femmina?|`|f32U2Eytaa	no, non fa male. <br>  tutte le teorie su presunti disturbi derivanti dalla masturbazione sono frutto di tentativi di dissuasione bigotti...<br>  non hanno fondamento ma sono duri a morire.|`|fhMpctO6aa	non fa assolutamente male!! anzi|`|kFm75YBIaa	Se si diverte......|`|nsHyLn1uaa	vuoi dire il tuo amico immaginario......<br>  <br>  dai se lo vuoi sapere tu, non occorre tirare in ballo altri....<br>  ti ho scoperto ehhhhhhh.....<br>  <br>  va be cmq è tutto normale...ankio quando nn avevo la ragazza gli davo giu di brutto, ora che ce l'ho, cerco di "fare" solo cn lei, anke se a volte do una ripassatina..<br>  <br>  tutti lo fanno, e il 90 % se ne fa 1 o 2 al giorno, <br>  <br>  TUTTI....anke quelli che nella loro risposta dicono che fa schifo....ma fa schifo cosa?  siate meno orgogliosi di voi stessi....|`|z9ebZQN7aa	non fa male magari avrà qualche occhiaia di troppo :)<br>  Comunque se è adoloscente è abbastanza normae..se invece è un po' più grande sarebbe meglio che si trovasse una ragazza..|`|79riZrEAaa	no no vai tranquillo digli solo di stare attento ke nn si consumi sennò poi lo deve cambiare|`|AoOQ9OR9aa	non fa ne bene ne male, fa ciò che sente.|`|O61WlWcyaa	se lo stringe troppo si ciao|`|WOIkBewdaa	ma infatti non vedo quale sia il problema....è normale alla sua età.....io me ne facevo anche + di 2 al giorno...perchè è come un gioco nuovo...non avevi niente da fare e ti masturbavi....adesso ho 15 anni....e ho smesso....ma a dir la verità ho smesso solo per le cazzat.e che mi raccontavano....mi dicevano che masturbarsi fa venire i brufoli....io mi ero messo paura....e avevo smesso....adesso non ci penso più a masturbarmi...quella cazzat.a sui brufoli era fenomenale ;)|`|pgESP22baa	Presentagli una donna|`|rQ1tKk62aa	no..ma fa schifo
ee59fdbac185f9dfd94b9de544772794aa	Ritengo che la domanda che hai posto sia da leggere come se fosse stata fatta direttamente da tua mamma.<br>  <br>  Di certo non si trova in una facile situazione, anche perchè una donna gay non si arrende facilmente (insomma non è come l'uomo italiano che ricevendo un "segnale negativo" generalmente si ritira in buon ordine).<br>  <br>  Probabilmente tua mamma dovrà attrezzarsi mentalmente a dover dare un segnale forte ed inconfondibile dopo il primo (che ritengo farà affidamento sulla sensibilità di chi riceve il segnale).<br>  <br>  Se questo dovesse mettere in gioco l'amicizia che tua mamma ha con questa sua collega di lavoro, dille (a tua mamma) di ricordare che non avrebbe senso se si sentisse responsabile di una eventuale rottura del rapporto ... perchè chi riceve il segnale negativo sa bene che il persistere porterebbe alla rottura e quindi sa bene che continuando sarebbe la prima responsabile della fine del rapporto (tua mamma sta rifiutando una relazione sentimentale, non sta rifiutando una amicizia, no?).<br>  <br>  Dille che le auguro buona fortuna ... e che la sua amica sia una persona sensibile ed intelligente!<br>  <br>  .|`|6ryrz5uuaa	E' proprio vero che non si finisce mai di stupirsi. cara amica credo che questa vicenda deve essere affrontata soltanto da tua madre. Solo se lei ti chiederà un parere potrai dire la tua. Tutt'avia non dovresti preoccuparti più di tanto. Se tua madre non ha strane tendenze ed è etero sessuale non deve fare altro che dire apertamente alla sua mica che può essere solo tale e che altri accostamenti sono indesiderati. certo, il loro rapporto non potrà essere come prima, ma trovo che non sia giusto che i due non si frequentassero più. Bisogna anche rispettare le "tendenze" altrui alpatto che questi non interferiscono con i nostri principi e le nostre tendenze. Purtroppo l'omosessualità è un problema che sempre più si sta affacciando nella nostra società. Non è un fatto nuovo, perchè queste persone sono sempre esistite, soltanto che prima erano più nascosti,ultimamente  invece la cosa si stà allargando a vista d'occhio. E' bello essere trasgressivo ma fino ad un certo punto. abbi fiducia in tua madre e rispetta la sua intelligenza e le sue scelte.

Sadly, it appears he chosen this other girl over his true friends.  It's a sad thing...but I imagine the girl is the jealous-type and very clingy...or maybe he's putting too much attention on his girlfriend.  I'm not sure how old you all are...but they'll probably break up soon and things will return to normal.  Its a sad thing when people turn their backs on their true friends just because of some 'fling of the month' but sadly...people just don't care.  <br>  <br>  Confront him next time you see him and talk to him about it (but since you DON'T have feelings for him, make that apparent in the beginning) and tell him you want t hangout more.  If he's a true friend he'll realize whats more important.|`|60d4a6cdea625867b1e29a555628e03daa	he proabbyl jst doesnt want his gf to think he's flirting with other girls and make her feel jelious.|`|0b5511ff8489459062eb382f8a1ad812aa	His new girlfriend may not want him to hang out with other girls.|`|4942f91d76055f029470ddcb6a50a153aa	You should tell him how you feel, but you should be happy for him.

DNwHGeEtaa	Sounds like you don't like her in a romantic and you two are just friends. This is from my past experience, guys and girls can be friends, but being best friends or very close friends can only cause problems. It's not that her boyfriend is very jealous, it's a normal thing for him to feel if you hang out with his girlfriend all the time. If you one day have a girlfriend, she will have the same problem with your "strange" relationship with your friend. I know you don't want to hook up or anything, but believe me there will only be problems. Any girl you like and who likes you back, after seeing how close you are with your female friend, will step back and you won't have a chance with any other girl. Unless you want to date this female friend of yours, you should just keep this as normal friendship don't become closer or best friends.

He says hi to you every time he sees you in the halls or around town.<br>  14. He tries his hardest to make you mad or annoyed.

You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, you like orange fizz..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue. <br>  Source(s):<br>  current issue w/ me 2|`|wPeur7xTaa	You need to talk to him, with his girlfriend present.  You need to be honest about how you feel, and you need to not interfere with their relationship.  Moreover, you need to pledge to both of them that you will not interfere.<br>  <br>  You need to see what the deal is, and then determine the appropriate action to take.  Understand that this will change the tenor of your relationship, though.|`|zThZROltaa	just tell him anyway. the same thing happended to me but it was worse because he was going out with my BEST friend.<br>  <br>  btw we are going out now.|`|AA11354533	Sounds like you need to read the book "He's Just Not That Into You".<br>  <br>  If he wanted to date you, he would.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to be a boyfriend stealer?

En cuanto al beso, te apuesto que lo hizo a propósito para darte celos, como los que sintió ella al verte en myspace con la otra chica, y para completar dices que estas saliendo con otra y se lo comentaste a una amiga de ella. Pues amiguito, que más quieres, tu mismo tienes la pregunta. CELOS y DUDAS. Algo que tu debes de decidir, si seguir con la que andas ahora o buscarla.

Si aún la quieres te recomiendo que pienses bien, ya que si se besó con otro en menos de una semana y en frente tuyo imagina que hará a tus espaldas.<br>  Date la oportunidad de conocer a otra chica de tu edad, no busques una mayor, recuerda que las mujeres (no todas)somos más adelantadas que los hombres .<br>  Suerte!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|740c48006286f69e3d70811e6a1dc703aa	quizá te borro porque no te entiende, tu pregunta es un relajo, saludos y suerte.|`|908d1bf082325f9033f036ac4ea128bcaa	No te andes con ninerias,  si ella te borro es porque ya no quiere saber nada, o tal vez este celosa pero como quiera que sea,  ya no pierdas tu tiempo, si terminaron es como tu dices porque ya no daba para mas la relacion, entonces a seguir tu camino y conocer y disfrutar de nuevas aventuras, ....No lo amas verdaderamente es solo que como se han dado las cosas te hace sentri un poco culpable....ya Olvida todo este rollo y a Gozar......|`|Oi86lR09aa	yo creo que si le importas, bueno ami si me importaria un ex y mas si tenemos poco de haber terminado, pero alomejor tu poniendo esas fotos y saliendo con otra al poco tiempo acabaste con lo que habia quedado en ella de ti. si ella se beso con otro a los dias pero no reaccionamos igual cuando uno hace algo y despues te lo regresan.|`|POkCy5fMaa	?Que onda Zarpado?

Ok, ella la regó al besar a otro chavo, pero con esto tu también la sacaste de onda. Los celos no te van a ayudar a recuperarla. Se ve que eres un chavo buena onda, Tal vez sería mejor que te des un tiempo para estar bien tu, tómate tu tiempo, haz tus cosas, escuela, trabajo, amigos, igual y un tiempo fuero de chavas te ayuda a saber que quieres para ti y a estar bien. ya el tiempo dirá si eta chava es para ti y tu para ella o les pondrá a alguien que los haga muy felices.

b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	When he looks at you, just look back at him (eye to eye contact) hold this position for as long as you both can, and just smile when your doing it.... that will give him a sure sign you like him without saying a word. <br>  <br>  But sooner or later you or he will have to talk to each other, or it wont go anywhere... so if hes too shy to talk to you, you might have to go up to him and just start a casual conversation, then eventually ask him "Would you like to go to the movies with me sometime?" stuff like that... <br>  <br>  Hope that helps you, good luck.

AA11309305	This same thing happened to me and it took me a while to figure out what was really going on.  The thing is that he does care for you on a different level then he does for his other friends, but he does not want to commit to you.  He likes the attention you give him and the fact that he can flirt with you all the time and have nothing to serious come out of it.  If you have no feelings for him then this is not a problem, but if you do have feelings for him then becareful because you can end up being really hurt.|`|9FPOtvJaaa	Wow...<br>  <br>  lets get a couple things straight you like the guy you flirt with.<br>  Puching in the arm is not a boyfirend-girlfriend indicator nor is someone making fun of you.<br>  <br>  Guys tend to have a "backup girlfriend" you sound like you are his "backup girlfriend" until the get really serious with someone.  A female friend that he can turn to when he needs advice, a female to confide in, a girl to that is easy to deal with, pratice dealing with other females with.<br>  <br>  Sometime it evolves into more most of the time not. BUT... That is okay cause you can enjoy each others company.<br>  espcially if he wants to practice kissing. OOhhh my! :)<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|1rMUQdsBaa	I have something lie that!! But I am friends with his Girlfriend so i can't go for it But just try!! It does not hurt to try now odes it???|`|qP3AMyNPaa	He says he likes someone else and you say that you like someone else.  You each like someone else.  So what's the problem?
G5uTV9TTaa	Have you talked to your husband about this?  Does he want to have sex with the other woman?  Maybe he just wants to watch.  However, you cannot be jealous.  It is just sex, no meaning, absolutely no "I love you" and no secrets.  Your husband must always be the center of your focus.  If you lose that, or if he does, you will not last long in either that way of life or as a couple.<br>  <br>  I have known couples who are very jealous of each other, but go to swing clubs and watch each other having sex with other people.  It is more about the secrets than the act.  You can also set boundaries, like no doing something that you especially like.  As an example, you might like anal sex and you two do that on special occasions.  So, that could be a boundary.  The down side is the more boundaries, the greater the chance that this is just not your real desire.<br>  <br>  Don't do this as a whim, or a desire to get even.  If you think the visual memory of your first kiss or your wedding are vivid, the memory of the first time you see your partner having sex makes the others pale in comparison.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|pkLD5r5Taa	Bite the bullet and get into like you should. You won't have time to be jealous|`|xQn3rR6Naa	That is just nasty|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	ever wonder what would happen if your husband fell in love with the female, and it caused a divorce?|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	You want a threesome - why?<br>  So that you can lose your mind.?<br>  WHy would a person that KNOWS they are jealous even consider it?<br>  Why don't you just break your leg.. it would probably hurt less.<br>  <br>  I am NOT jealous.... but a threesome ended a relationship.... it very rarely  works.<br>  <br>  Don't do it unless you are willing to throw your marriage down the drain.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Then don't do it.  It will ruin your marriage.  What you're saying above is that you want to have sex with a woman but you don't want your husband to.  So really what you want is to cheat and you want your husband to be okay with it.  Good luck with that.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Its a great fantasy for us both.  It really spices up the long time marriage.  Excellent mental stimulation for a woman.|`|8txWayVnaa	Don't have a threesome|`|GQUaFGHLaa	Having a threesome is not something that you should ever consider and not while you are married. If you are a jealous person it could eventually ruin your marriage and then you could end up divorced. I have heard about things like that happening and that is not something that you should want to happen.|`|yFKP8f0Aaa	don't do it, you might fight about it later on. if you are a jealous type a person i would personally just leave it at that. <br>  <br>  and later on you might compare yourself to this other lady <br>  <br>  it's your husband, dont share unless he is just a piece of *ss|`|1fd011c04b7013be44a3fd5dc118bf7baa	lay out some ground rules , and talk it out before you do anything<br>  since its you who want to , you should pick the other women and if you dont want your husband to do anything but watch let it be known , its all about communicating your wants and desires before hand|`|AA11825142	i think you should not go through with anything like this. Its your husband! Not a random guy you are dating. Sorry the only suggestion I have for you is to not have a threesome. Keep it as a fantasy only!|`|LCnVgsj4aa	don't do it. you may regret it later. when you are away your husband may hook- up with your Friend behind your back and not think it is a big deal .|`|X6aYVpU3aa	because you love your husband and you will never ever get over it unless you don't love your husband anymore.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	If you can't handle the fire, don't play around with it ... it'll burn you and it'll hurt ...|`|yIGVOqXdaa	dont have the threesome if u cant handle it

POSSIBLE. but not for sure. it depends on your ages.|`|sFuz1MvCaa	thats really not a sign im sorry but he might just be annoyed with the class and looking around the room for something to stare at he doesnt mean anything when he breathes at you  sorry|`|5e40172dcb0fc20a3ff72767e7671713aa	Maybe who knows, but i will say wait untill he spits on you then you will deffinately know he likes you!|`|Oij7F2jKaa	ohh yeah thats the first step in liking you the second step would be an unobtrusive fart to the face then your in like flynn|`|b8FRvTVmaa	well talk to him dont just watch him be proactive about the situation you adviously like him if you watch him that mutch flirt with him allitle and see what he does|`|G0zOPniRaa	YOU BEST GET HIM BEFORE HE FALLS OUTTA LOVE WHICH YOU!|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Maybe it's just me but I would feel creeped out if some guy sat there breathing on me!!!|`|ronomgTIaa	god i hope youre not serious.

AA10144140	It is wonderful that you have the opportunity to decide whether to move in together or not, without the question as to whether the kids will be happy.  The old saying goes " you really do not know a person until you have lived with them."  It may seem a lifetime that you have know him, these past seven years, but there are little thing that may make the difference.  Little things that may turn you off towards him, but I you truly love him, those little thing will be nothing.  Keep your home and try living together.  It may be what you are looking for.  If living together is not working out, consider buying a home closer to him.  Only time will tell.  Good Luck!|`|AA12178488	I would move in together that's when you REALLY get to know how compatible you are with someone<br>  I also find that my husband and I spend more time together doing little things...ex...watching TV eating dinner<br>  But, if we never lived together I wouldn't know about his little "habits"<br>  like leaving his socks all over the house. I would reccomend to anyone to live together before marriage so you can see if you are truly compatible. Because anyone can get along from a distance LOL

If you have a good relationship then you will get the respect you deserve. If you are constantly picking at each other and bickering in front of people, that is annoying.
d8i5RWcRaa	Dear JD,<br>  <br>  Hey, no problem.  We all have those times when we feel like we're in a rut, and nothing seems to be moving forward.  It's perfectly normal.  <br>  <br>  As for your grades....  much more is being expected out of you in college.  Moreso than in high school.  And it's going to take a little while before you get into the swing of things. Don't put so much pressure on yourself.  All that can be expected is for you to do your very best.  That's all anyone can ask of you.  And I assure you, you will find your groove, and things will improve.  Don't worry. <br>  <br>  I guess your boyfriend has the urge to blow off some steam before deployment.  I guess that's ok, as long as he doesn't leave you sitting there in his dust.  I do think that he could include you in what he's doing, considering it might be awhile before he sees you again.  If it's any consolation to you, he'll me missing you soon enough, once he's on Iraqi soil.  The thoughts of being without you will drive him nuts!  <br>  <br>  Cheer up, my friend. Things will smooth out for you.  Sometimes dark clouds come in and ruin our day, but they don't last forever.  The sun eventually comes out, and it will for you also.  So smile, ok?|`|67SBy3YWaa	Everything will be okay.|`|PIetEkueaa	Stress made you feel sad. And yes, the depressing atmosphere of winter makes it even worse. Maybe you could do some relaxing activities, like listening to music, have a cup of tea, or go out and play sports or just take a walk in the park. Fresh air would lighten up your mood :)|`|okyT4lzmaa	Everything will be okay! We all go through a little depression at times. Luv ya.

Tell her you would love to hear about her BF but not ALL THE TIME if she is a good friend she will understand.|`|RCUomvyOaa	I have friends like that too, and i have tried to say something and they get all offended so you will probably just have to deal with it for awhile until they mature some more.|`|MbwyCneeaa	why dont u just learn to deal with it cuz it is a part of life and by the way get a freaking life|`|6ddNezzSaa	whenever you say something to girls like that they get offended.  just ask her GENTLY to let you say something.  then switch the subject. or maybe you're just a little jealous?|`|xqZVXunvaa	i think you are jealous! get a life

Identify one thing that you know is true about you and your relationships.<br>  Once you have mastered that, find the 2nd thing, and so on.<br>  Your life has been shattered and your emotions and thought processes have been abused.  You need to find your way back to a healthier place.<br>  <br>  Once there, your self respect will help you to define positive goals.  Your past experience will serve as a reminder not to let yourself be toyed with again.<br>  <br>  No, it isn't easy.  It's hard work, but once achieved, your life should be smooth and happy again.<br>  <br>  I know.  I was there.  I stil remember the devastation and its memory served me to make sure that it NEVER happen again.<br>  <br>  So far, I am happy.

Hopefully, that is the case and nothing more happened. If so you got out cheap. You really need to look at his character and not be sad about it, get pissed! Do you really think this guy is something special? I mean come on! It was a learning experience and I am sure that you will never let another married man come close to you again. So, you actually gain from this experience, not lose. Remember that and be thankful that you don't have this scum coming home to you every night!|`|cHROCt3Aaa	i don't know why everyone is so quick to assume you knew he was married. i dated a guy for a while, and when he finally brought me to his house all his wife's stuff was still there. his story was one day she just packed her & the kids' clothes and left. supposedly she planned on coming back and getting the rest of her things.<br>  turned out she was staying at his parents' while he was supposed to be tdy. i probably wasn't the only girl he lied to. they had a 3 year old and a 5 month old. i was young and dumb, looking back i see things now but i was barely 18, so...<br>  anyways, it hurt badly but only for a few days.. eventually i realized what a dick he was for screwing his wife and children over.. you'll get it over just like any other heartbreak.. consider yourself lucky. it could be worse-you could be the wife.<br>  i'm sorry.|`|3iNobwVraa	Ahhh.  Good golly, don't play victim!  <br>  <br>  No one can ever play with your emotions without your consent.  Did you lay them out when you shouldn't have?

It may hurt, but the only one who played with your emotions was you, by treating them blithely when you should have protected them.  <br>  <br>  Learn.  And move on.  No victims in a scenario like this, sorry.  Nice try.|`|ekr6BBe3aa	Anytime you're with a married person who you aren't married to they are only after a good time.

JkvlAVX2aa	I happen to know your situation very well.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep him here in US is for him to maintain his F-1 student visa status until you become a US citizen and you petition for him based on the spouse of US citizen priority.  <br>  <br>  Be very diligent on keeping his F-1 status valid because USCIS has been cracking down on foreigners NOT maintaining legal status while in US.  And if he has not maintain his legal status, that will cause potential issues when you later petition for his GC based on the marriage.<br>  <br>  If you petition for him while you are still just a GC holder, it will take a long time, e.g. 3 to 5 years wait, and it's usually closer to 5 years than 3 years.<br>  <br>  If you petition for him after you have become a US citizen, it usually takes 6 to 8 months.  <br>  <br>  My advise is that you should file your US citizenship application as soon as possible.  That will take 6 to 8 months.  Then, you can petition for him using your citizenship status.<br>  <br>  There is also other considerations about when you two should get married.  USCIS will process your petition for him differently based on when you two get married and where he physically resides when you file the petition.  Of course, the processing time will also be different depending on those conditions.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Contact immigration & naturalization> For the correct answer>|`|yIGVOqXdaa	marrying you wont keep him here.

zdu3gh8jaa	Try talking to him and telling him how you feel. Invite him to do things together. In the event that he starts arguing and shouting, don't retaliate, just walk away. When he's calmed down again go back to him and ask if there is anything he wants to do etc just act as if his moodiness did not happen.<br>  It's nice to hear that you want to be friemds with your brrother, keep communicating with him and let him know what it means to you to have him as your brother.<br>  I hope things work out for you in the future, Good Luck.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Find something in common that you both like to do.

wMWfCjBpaa	OK, I COULD BE SO WRONG. We went over the sacrament of Matrimony last night in class at church. If he is Catholic and got married outside of the church, then it is not considered valid. Therefore an annulment is not necessary. Since it is not considered a marriage in the eyes of the church no need for an annulment for a marriage that did not exist to the church. But if you marry someone who was not Catholic and is divorced, his marriage was considered valid in the eyes of his previous religion or law. It's kind of like Catholics knew better but didn't do what they knew was part of their faith. So it's like he didn't honor his true faith in it. Hope this makes sense. Speak to your Priest and it should help a lot. My friend is going through this. Her fiance was married before and it was a non-Catholic marriage. He has to get an annulment because his marriage was considered valid according to his beliefs.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You have to talk to a priest to see what all is involved.|`|8ygky5g4aa	If he was not previously married in the Catholic church then he does not need an annulment because according to the Catholic church his marriage was not valid.<br>  <br>  You do need to call the church that you are interested in getting married in and find out what their requirements are.  Usually they require 1 of the couple to be confirmed Catholic and sometimes they require you to be a member of that church.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usccb.org/laity/marriage/marriagefaqs.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/laity/marriage/marr...</a>|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	go talk to your priest and get the ball rolling.  if she does not help in the annulment then he may get it by default!

Estas personas felices eligen estar felices o estar reprochandose de lo que les toca vivir así eligen estar contentas. estas personas pueden sentirse victimas de sus maridos pero ellas elijen aceptar que el matrimonio no es todo dulce. <br>  estas personas muestran su entusiasmo en  lugar de intentar convencer o fingir que son felices.<br>  <br>   EN MI JUICIO TU NECESITAS MEJORAR EL CONTROL DE TU RELACIóN SENTIMENTAL CON TU ESPOSO. NO MENCIONAS CUáL ES LA DIFICULTAD CON EL . PERO TE EXPONGO UN TEMA OJALA TE SIRVA DE ALGO.<br>  SIESTAS padeciendo de hostilidad en tu matrimonio, entonces las actitudes de los dos tienen que cambiarse por otras. por ejemplo SEGúN UN ESTUDIO UN GRAN PASO PARA MANTENER UNA RELACIóN MáS ESTABLE Y SATISFACTORIAS ES que ambos usen más el ponombre "Nosotros" en vez del "Yo" cuando entablen comunicación. ya que este pronombre induce compromiso e induce a la calma de lo  contrario usando el "yo" te puede llevar a peleas emocionales bastantes serias.<br>   Deja que tu pareja expongan sus puntos de vista sin interrumpirle. ni discutirle.<br>  Evita las frases tajantes y, sobre todo, las descalificaciones.<br>  Acepta de forma  natural sus diferencias.<br>  no esperes que todo el mundo comparta tus puntos de vista<br>   respeta la Libertad de elección del otro.<br>  <br>  evita criticar. dile lo que más te gusta de tu pareja. <br>  pero sobre todo son una moneda con dos caras. y eso tiene solución si juntos buscan lo que los une. <br>  practica el perdón perdonandote primero a ti misma y luego perdonando a los demás. aceptando la realidad tal y como fue.<br>  saludos, cordiales *test...|`|BfUiggXAaa	Si hay matrimonios felices, hay parejas que llevan 40 ó 50 a?os de matrimonio y se consideran felices, el secreto: amor, tolerancia, paciencia y perdón.|`|a72a6b92d01384ce011bbaf1b24e1364aa	Si existen pero pocos pues para que dos personas sean felices se requieren de muchos condimentos, atracción física, ternura, sensibilidad, valores e intereses comunes, habilidad para la comunicación y el entendimiento, deseo profundo de compartir la vida con una persona del sexo opuesto, capacidad de profundizar en las relaciones, capacidad de compromiso profundo, paciencia, entre los mas importantes.

Se debe trabajar cada día y la base de todo debe ser el amor; esto es lo que te hace negociar cuando no estas de acuerdo, a callarte cuando está a punto de ofender y a pedir perdón cuando sabes que está en riesgo tu amor. Todavía amas a tu esposo? Qué expectativas no cumple como esposo? Sinceramente, en que has fallado? Qué estas dispuesta a hacer? creo que estas respuestas pueden ayudarte a replantear un panorama distinto.

IhzyOhxcaa	he sounds like a total flirt. if he does that to you while he has a girlfriend and if you go out with him he will flirt with other girls and do the exact same thing. you can be flirty aswell but i dont think it is worth a relationship.

aEpPt9koaa	I consider cheating to be anything that is done with the opposite sex that you try to hide from or dont want your spouse to know about.|`|CBa9G4j4aa	I would be a little upset if he flirted with a girl. Not really but if it was his ex that he was flirting with I would definitely be upset. Kissing, holding hands, or anything more then that is definitely cheating to me.|`|zPOO2vHBaa	i do not consider cheating something you can "draw a boundary line" on. like, if i kiss him/her, if we make out, have cyber sex or whatever example one wants to imagine that makes it cheating. <br>  i think if there is something a person is HIDING or if they're not totally candid with their partner, that it's a kind of cheating. really, i do! <br>  there is love when a person cares for another's feelings and puts themselves in that person's place..and is honest and trustworthy ..and then there is...whatever HURTS that other person and causes them to mistrust you.|`|fudPrZTyaa	Well, that's very broad... I would say if your partner is hiding or trying to hide something from you, then that is already fishy. For example, emailing and/or texting a coworker without your knowledge, that would be strange. Flirting would obviously be under this category. The way your partner looks at another girl, if he turns his head to look at her,... doesn't cheating start with thoughts? It starts from the heart. Without a doubt: physical contact (hugging, touching, or getting to close), sending flowers, complimenting too much, I would consider borderline to cheating. Just about putting yourself in the situation for the cheating to happen, I think is already cheating. Of course kissing, etc... yes, it's cheating. I think if you pursue a third person even if you're trying to be funny and sassy, that's cheating, because you're doing if with an intent. I hope that helps.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	I don't mind casual flirting in a social situation - party or restaurant - as long as the man has a sense of boundaries - i.e. can flatter a woman and laugh without indicating anything sexual or anything but THAT moment.  Flirting with a waitress is ok.... but not going back to that same restaurant to flirt. <br>  I don't mind same sex friends, but I would expect that I am her friend also...    I would expect that if I become uncomfortable with this friendship... my man would respect my wishes (if we are building a future together)<br>  INTIMATE talk (about our marriage) should never be done with another woman.  Close male friends or counselor only.<br>  Internet bullshit is bullshit.<br>  OF course.. NO kissing or anything of an intimate nature at all.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Hanging out with a another girl one on one and not telling her he's taken.  If he touched her hand or held it, or anything beyond that would be cheating to me.  If I found out he was even kickin it with another girl, he would have some 'splaining to do!|`|oGo4ftFMaa	Well, I'm not jealous by no means. But before my husband and I we're engaged he told another person he loved them. (girl, he liked) <br>  And once we were engaged, I cheated. (but i was drunk and taken advantage off) He calls it cheating and well so do i, i shouldn't have gotten drunk. Anyways, we both consider anything that has to do with the opposite sex cheating, or what leads to it, or let alone, the desire to do, therefore its cheating. No calling the opposite sex, talking (unless needed to, of course) kissing, touching, flirting etc etc etc|`|IOsrDhrJaa	Telling a person they have feelings for them. Kissing of any sort.

Just enjoy yourself and him, and talk to your friends about, maybe even one of your closest guy friends. Don't worry. Someday, you'll find someone who feels exactly the same about you.

You have to remember that your Mom is your Mom.  You can still be best of friends, but your Mom has to have the right to teach you all the lessons of life that you need to become a wonderful young adult.  Cussing and showing disrespect is no way to treat any friend much less your Mom. You Mom doesn't slap you up because she knows that won't show or teach you respect.

Tambien creo que la influencia y presion que los padres pueden ejercer en sus hijos, hace que éstos conciente o inconcientemente, hagan lo que los padres quieren o repitan errores cometidos por ellos; lo cual es muy perjudicial y los reprime como individuos.|`|MnZQbv7faa	Creo que desde que aprendemos lo que esta bien y no aprendemos a tomar desiciones y ya no le corresponde a nuestros padre la responsabilidad aunque nuestra infancia haya sido negativa pienso que todos nos damos cuenta cuando no actuamos de buena manera, así que los padres no tienen nada que ver.|`|cWJzXDx2aa	Hijo de tigre sale pintado.

El problema es hacernos conscientes de la responsabilidad a que nos hacemos como padres de Familia. No permitamos que nuestros hijos busquen en la calle lo que no encuentran en casa. Cuando esta el amor de por medio no tenemos por que dudar de nuestros propios hijos por que han sido fruto de nuestro ejemplo. Es cierto que estamos en una sociedad dificil, pero si nuestros hijos los hemos preparado con bien en todo sentido, no tenemos por que temer.  Dios te bendiga.|`|dVDRMC1Uaa	En efecto los primeros a?os de la vida son fundamentales para el desarrollo futuro de los hijos,pero llega un momento en la cual ellos ya son capaces de elegir algun camino que la misma vida les pone ,en ese momento ellos estan tomando la responsabilidad y por ende asumiendo las consecuencias (buenas o malas) de esta eleccion,por lo que no creo que sea responsabilidad de los padres a esta altura.Suerte|`|w49KzVpjaa	creo que si influye, los primeros a?os son el reflejo de la ense?anza moral y social que te den tus padres, pero creo también que  somos nosotros los que decidimos como ser, quizá si no tenemos los valores morales suficientes sea motivo de, pero no considero que haya responsabilidad paterna, mas bien creo que la actitud y manera en que actuamos es influenciada por el entorno donde estamos no donde estuvimos, somo capaces de discernir entre lo bueno y lo malo, somos responsables de tomar una actitud y una decisión, creo que si hay gente mala por naturaleza por que es parte de su esencia y no creo que sea responsabilidad paterna cuando actuamos de manera mala o ilegal, o desorientada, creo que todo ser es capaz de diferenciar lo bueno de lo malo y que es responsable por sus actos|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	No necesariamente debe ser culpa de los padres cuando ya son personas adultas. Ya que si le dieron educación de familia y el hijo quiso más irse por lo que aprendió en la calle y cometer fechorías u otras cosas graves como dices, eso es culpa de él no de los padres. Se de familias muy decentes y de buena formación que a la larga sus hijos se combierten en malandrines, y eso, no es culpa de los padres sino de la sociedad en que vivimos y ellos se dejan llevar por eso y no por los principios que le inculcaron en su casa y se dejan llevar por los amigotes que conocen en la calle.<br>  Pero también se ve el caso de aquellos hijos que crecen en familias desmembradas y sin principios, valores ni ense?anzas buenas y se convierten en seres de malos sentimientos y mal comportamiento. Pero es relativo, ya que muchos lo que no consiguen en la casa, a veces se lo da la escuela o amigos decentes y se hacen personas buenas.

Ajz5hyXJaa	I have the same problem she has so i can tell you straight up. She has probably been around people who have had relationship problems. she is always thinking of the future and the thought of all of it can be overwhelming to her and it tends to make us shy away from those we love most. You need to be there for her when she needs you, but don't suffocate her with love. Believe it or not girl love guys they cant have and that is mostly the problem. If she knows that you are in love with her and want to be with her she may be more stand offish<br>  don't push her away but dont come off like your life depends on being with her even if it does. and if she tells you that she is feeling like shes going back to her old ways pull her back. Tell her exactly what you feel at that moment and tell her that you want her to be happy. Be there for her when she needs you and tell her ever so often how much you truly do love her|`|28ace4b478f0d1936cd87055ad9fff5eaa	Sounds like she's afraid things are moving too fast for her. Cut her some slack. You can't MAKE someone love you.|`|Jdiu48aiaa	therapy|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Just tell her what you have said here, maybe if she realizes this she will relax and learn to trust you and her feelings. Sounds like she was really burnt badly in the past and gets to a point where she cares about someone and freezes as you describe it. Good luck|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I have to agree, that even if she doesn't remember it, something scarred her and now she has some commitment issues. This does not mean that she's cheating on you or anything, it just means that whenever a longterm commitment comes into the pictures, she "freezes" and subconsciously pushes it away. The best thing you can do is slow it down. Firstly, I would talk to her about it. Tell her if the relationship title is putting too much on her, you guys can just be friends for now. Eventually, she should get over this problem (not totally, but she'll be comfortable enough with you so she's not scared or whatever of long term commitment with your relationship). It sound like you guys just really need to take it slow. You need to explain this to her and make sure you guys are on the same page about the relationship. If you just start slacking off, she might think you're trying to leave her. It's best to be up front about it. You guys can work it out together. Honestly, she may not want to, but couples counceling really can help you out. They can see things that you can't sometimes, and with so much experience, they can help you work it out. Well, I really hope that it works out for you. It sounds like you really care about her. I'm sorry I couldn't help more.

Be glad that you are all healthy and alive.   I would put your good things away where your sister can't get to them.  Your mom sounds like she is just trying to keep the peace.  Maybe you should both think about her before making home a war zone.  If she won't, then you should for mom's sake.  The best response is not to react at all - think about it - she did it to make you angry or was destructive out of her own anger - yes you are angry, but don't let her see it or let it get control of you.  Put some of the money you would have put into your sister's birthday or Christmas present into replacing the make-up if you must, but don't tell her that.  Good luck.|`|KvE6eKWxaa	My sister and I would also do stuff like this when we were angry at each other. But i realized it has got to stop sometime.

Maybe you should ask if all of you guys can have a family meeting. Hey you never know it might work. Your sister should be the closest person to you. When times is tough you guys got to count on each other.|`|LfRTNGoraa	that would make me mad. although i don't have a little sister, i have an older brother, the worse we do is punch and kick and hit each other. i think you should talk to your mom again, and if she doesn't do anything, you go talk your sister. stay calm!|`|0k2y3bNgaa	Calm down, you are being a tad bit immature about this. I mean, she just scratched it. You can still use it you know. And yes that was rude of your sister, but striking back will make you look just as stupid.<br>  <br>  Just calmly scold her. Be like "okay I really don't why the hell you'd do that, since it was really immature, but whatever. If you won't apologize, then you better start watching your own stuff because I do something twice as mean..."<br>  <br>  Of course, you shouldn't actually do something back since it will keep the fight going.<br>  <br>  I've had my brother do stuff like this to me, but trust me, in like a week you won't even care!
MUDDyIKtaa	It seems pretty far fetched that a 5 year old would make that up, you need to continue on with your complaint immediately with your school, and also with your school board and superintendent. If you know any of the other parents you could research to see if this has happened to any of there children. You may be surprised at what you find. Or maybe nothing at all. It does not matter what the child did or said there is absolutely NO reason for such behavior from a teacher. You need to make sure you truly ask the questions needed to get the right story and the local police departments can help you or a therapist. remember to get the facts before you accuse. I would for sure check out everything you can Good Luck!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Ask your son to go through what happened step by step. If there were other children present, ask them what they remember.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	If your son had a hand print or fingerprints on his face you can tell if it was a slap or not.  Further, you can tell if it was an adult or one of his classmates.  If the mark is still visible take a picture and report the teacher and the school principle to the school board and possibly to the police.  Abuse is rampant all over and in school is no exception.  Good luck!|`|Wv592rOqaa	How horrific is that - I was a teacher of 1st grade for 2 years and I would never even consider smacking my students.  <br>  <br>  The truth is, it is this poor little 5 year old up against a teacher and a board of people who govern the teacher.  I would insist that my 5 year old be removed from her class.  Since you have no proof and the child does not to feel intimidated or afraid of school, there is little you can do.  However, legally you can file a report with the local police as assault, then write your local Board of Education.  <br>  <br>  In situations like yours - you need a paper trail - send certified letters referencing your child's story, time, date and place it "allegedly" took place - ask that your child be placed in with another teacher w/o prejudice or fear of revenge in the new class - make it clear that, while you have no proof that the teacher hit him, you feel you have the right for a transfer and apologize in advance if in the future it turns out not to be true.|`|qlscULoiaa	I would certainly dig deeper into that one.<br>  Also, you might get another person to talk gently to your son (you can stand on the other side of the door)  and see what they get out of him.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	i don't think your son made the story up, so i would still file a complaining  order against the teacher and speak to a lawyer|`|rcQgfKPTaa	believe ur son!!<br>  five year olds dnt make that kinda stuff up.|`|XBCmzuSiaa	oh no that is not the right thing that a teacher should smack a 5 years old child.I prefer that you should say " it is really wrong to hit a child is 5 years old if you ever do that to my child do you know what im going to do? im going to sue you cause my child is just 5 years old.How about if i hit your child that is 3 years old for example do you think it hurts? well if you think it doesn't why don't i hit you until your face is red? huh?"  And if he did make up the story you should ask the students of they know. if it is not the teacher it must be a student or a stranger or he did it him self for playing|`|z3RnVpjCaa	If you think that you can trust the school I would let it go and have a sit down with my son. If you don't know than ask other parents of the class if their child has any knowledge of what happen in class with your son. Most parents would want to help you get too the truth.|`|hdRYXqY1aa	well i would call the police ur son will say the truth to them cause he will be scared and have the cops talk to the teacher and have everyone sit in the same room and have a discussion with the police there <br>  <br>  he is five so i have a feeling it is a lie|`|jQxkBrkraa	You should had called the police, at that very moment. I don't believe that a 5 year old would make something up like that.  I would had gone to the school, and smacked his teacher, and said that she made it up.  These teachers are getting out of hand nowadays..|`|piF3jeywaa	im 16 years old, when i was about his age i was abused by my babysitter.<br>  <br>  nobody did anything about it and they took it lightly. dont let them get away with this.<br>  <br>  report the teacher to the authorites and get a lawer|`|WjdY9EVPaa	take a pic of the marks if its to late your an idiot and a horrible parent if not great job now go down to your local police department and tell them your story (ps: if your son has a habit of lying then maybe he is)|`|RPY4Hqiaaa	i dont think he made that up<br>  ask him what happened that day <br>  & 2 tell u from start 2 finish<br>  & take pix ncase u have 2 take this 2 the police|`|sJ19GqYXaa	what did they say, that they made it look like your son was making up the story, talk to your son in frontt of the teacher i dont think that you son will denie it or lie infront of the teacher if they dont do this take this to the school district and if this happens again please take a picture of your son and go directly to the office and call the police they will be filling a report on this. Another thing that I could tell you that you are the only one that knows how your son acts and his facial expressions when he is lying and keep that in mind.<br>  good luck and hopefully everything goes out good.|`|rQr8KQSraa	How does he get home? Maybe someone on the bus? If not ASP? If not who else was present. If the school dismisses it go to the school county office and file a complaint.
z3RnVpjCaa	You can not chose your parents just your friends. So always talk with respect to your parent. Tell your parent respectfully that you do not approve of  the very bad behavior.|`|rAkqlM6haa	it depends on how old you are and what your relationship is with your parents.  If you are under 25 and are not independent, I would keep your thoughts to yourself unless you want world war 3.  Parents and people in general do not like to be told they are bad people/wrong.  But if you feel secure enough in your relationship with your parents, go for it.  Don't be a smartass about it, though.  Gently put out your points on why you think they were wrong, and definitely don't say it in front of the person who is saying these things about your parents.  IT is a private conversation between you and your parents.|`|MgmGZiAKaa	The right thing to do is to do you what you feel is right.<br>  If you think your parent has wronged someone, tell your parent.

If that person is still upset, they should talk it over with your parent, not you. If they bring up they subject again, I would tell them that its not my place, and you think that they should discuss this with your parent-not you<br>  good luck, but you be the mature one :)|`|C0lpFqlHaa	Well, it really depends on how you think there going to act if you say something like that. For me i love to piss them off so i just make as many smart *** remarks as i can!

Whd6tqLzaa	Stay away from him. You don't want to ruin their marriage, especially when his wife is a good friend of yours. He should be faithful to his wife, if he loves you so much, why did he marry someone else? <br>  <br>  He had choices, he made his choice and he should stick to it. You better not keep in touch with him, especially in private. Meet him when there are other people in the room and avoid him as much as possible. Make sure that he gets your message. If he doesn't, tell him clearly that its over between you two and you don't want to get involved with a married man.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Do not delude yourself, he wants to get into your panties, if you give in to this he will drop you soon afterwards and you will feel horrible.

Don't even contemplate this action. Karma comes for everyone! If you want this to happen to you then go for it.<br>  And you should tell his wife.

3NoQuoWuaa	Your mom may be over reacting a little but she has your best interest at heart. If you want to shock your mother, ask her why she thinks you are the spawn of the devil or why she thinks you are a bad kid. That should be a big eye opener for you. You just might find out that she loves you more than you could even imagine. A good parent will always know what their kids are doing on a computer. Putting your photo on the internet is a huge no no. There are too many sickos out there that will find where you live and come after you. She is concerned about predators that lurk on the internet. Don't forget, your mom was 13 once and knows all the problems you have to contend with. Please talk to your mom about this. She is the best friend you will ever have.r|`|wJRHTS7Maa	i dont really know but if you can use youe digi camera how did u get that pic on there??  But i really dont know y ur moms like that maybe shes lost her mind!?|`|K5IOSGXAaa	At 13 you shouldn't be posting photos like this of yourself anywhere for anyone to see, it is too sexy looking. Your mom is just having a hard time coming to grips with you growing up, plus she is probably concerned about you being on AIM so much. You have to be very careful on the internet, lots of weirdos and pervs out there. As far as the camera, well look at what you did here, everyone in the world can see this provocative photo of yourself, so she has real concerns there. Just understand that she is trying to protect you from things you cannot even imagine and keep on the straight and narrow, you will have a good life. At your age you have a lot of restrictions, just have the good humor to understand that your mom loves you very much and is just trying to make sure nothing bad happens to you. If she constantly is putting you down, talk to her about it calmly. And hug her too !!|`|N8SMdtStaa	Personally... you look like a kid who says she's a nice kid and then gets knocked up her freshman year of hs.... I'm sure you wouldn't lie about yourself because psh who lies about themselves on the internet... but who am I to judge... you might be a regular goody-two-shoes for all I know... I would say if you are serious and you do absolutely nothing to give off the wrong impression... your mom needs to go to the wacky shack for awhile... just sayin....
95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Tough one. <br>  <br>  First of all, I would think it's okay to cry, to show then that it's okay to feel grief. It's natural when someone you know dies.<br>  <br>  Let your student know in private that you are sorry for what he is going through, and that he doesn't need to worry about homework for a few weeks, if he doesn't want to do it. He might actually find doing homework to be comforting ..... he'll let you know.<br>  <br>  I think the most important thing to get across to the group is that death is a part of life, and not something to be feared. It might be an idea to look into death rituals in other cultures. For example, if any of them have Irish ancestors, you could ask about the funeral wake - which is a major party held in the house of the deceased, usually on the night of the funeral. It sounds bizarre, but it is a way of marking the death by celebrating the life of the deceased. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, but you don't say how old your students are ... it would need to be age-appropriate, of course.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	Does the student still have a good, loving Dad?<br>  Also, by "this event" do you mean another visit, or the mom's death?<br>  <br>  As a teacher, it's not necessarily your responsibility to emotionally support your students with family issues. But as a teacher, it's important to strengthen student-teacher relationships.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell your about preparing the students, but just be strong. It's definitely okay to cry- you can't know what crying vs not crying will do to your students, but I'm sure it won't affect them greatly whether or not you cry.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you much else since I'm not a 2nd grade mind....just try to not go too in depth with it and make it brief|`|veZLfnGFaa	This is hard.  I went through the same thing when I was 9.  My class came to my house to see me, with our teacher.  We all cried.  I saw a human side of my teacher I never thought I would see and one that I will never forget.  You don't have to be strong in these times - everyone will understand if you show a soft side and it will also help the kids show their emotion, too.|`|RPY4Hqiaaa	there's no way u can prepare any1 for this<br>  let the student know that u'll b here for him/her<br>  & of course it's ok to cry<br>  u should never hold it in
Yv6pa3QAaa	sometimes when you meet someone online and you talk for awhile, you develop feelings and wish they were here, and wonder what it would be like if they were there with you.  i've developed strong feelings for someone like it seems that you have, so i totally know what you're going through.  exactly.  but one day you will like what you have so much better in real life.. and you won't care so much about him.  it's kind of a waste of time because he's not there in your real every day life and there's no way of knowing what things would be like if he was there.  so enjoy it while it lasts i guess, but it's only a temporary thing.  :)|`|cJbtCv9kaa	It depends how old you are.

E2OKRhwYaa	I think you're ignorant and a possible troll. Women are very strong and creative creatures who have to bear through a lot now I'm not saying guys don't go through a lot but not half as much as women do who give the gift of life and maybe you're not faithful to your boyfriends but speak for yourself because I'm very faithful, just ask my boyfriend. Maybe you had a bad experience but you sound young and immature.|`|A2u06IS1aa	Well obviously im guessing that your gunna get a sex change. I mean all you said is what is about you too. Since your a female too. Girls usually dont treat guys horribly, guys treat girls horribly.. And plus girls SHOULD NOT be in the kitchen. We are not slaves or anything we should be allowed to do what we want when we want..|`|SjX72fPyaa	Wow I don't know where you are getting your information but women are definitely not weaker then men in everything! Yes some things they do have the upper hand on us. That I will admit. However it has been scientifically proven that we react much better under stress and we are better problem solvers. And women treat men just as horribly as men treat women. <br>  As for menstruation, have you even gotten your period yet?? Yes, half the time the cramps do hurt. They hurt like hell sometimes. And it is an inconvenience. Its a week of bleeding, how is that convenient for us?<br>  And your obviously not a mother either. Because giving birth hurts like a *****. Even with the drugs. I got the drugs, and yeah it does numb the pain but it does nothing for the pressure of the baby actually passing through the birth canal. You feel every bit of that. <br>  The only ignorant female I see in this thread would be you as a matter of fact.<br>  We don't belong in the kitchen. We are people not slaves! We deserve the right to be able to do what we want to do when we want to do it. Which includes having a career outside of the kitchen. But if that's what you believe then you might want to get off your computer and scurry on back to your kitchen<br>  <br>  By the way I think your a troll I just wanted to put my rant in here because your an idiot :)|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Sooo, how long before the sex change operation?|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	Oh menstruation IS bad kid, my pain gets so bad I pass out and throw up sometimes.<br>  You shouldnt' disrespect women so bad. Yes, we are weak, but that's how guys like us, weak, so they can protect us!!|`|AA11905831	Well, technically, depending on how your body is built, menstruation can hurt without control.  My mom had an illness of tumors that really gave the kicker.  And sometimes, birth can be painful if their their hole starts ripping and bleeding!  Not that I've had that much pain in my menstruation or I've given birth, but I can understand that people's bodies and minds are different.<br>  <br>  But, I understand your point.  I don't particularly like girls, though I am a girl.  In fact, I prefer men.  I've kind of lived around men in my life much more than in the womanly side.  I agree that some girls can be so mean to men.  I've always thought that men had much more humor and seemed to be nicer to me.  But, sometimes, men can also be as bad as women.  There are many kinds of men and women in the world.  Not all women will be mean, depending on their own, individual personality and their parents.<br>  <br>  Do you really think all women are weak?  There are very brave women and kind women in our lifetime.  In fact, I think men can be equally as arrogant, with the limitations there are mentally between men and women in the society.  Still, I get your point.  I've had bad experiences when it comes to mean girls.  Just don't hate.  Women aren't generally like that.  I don't know what to say about myself.  I'm normally nice to men and I've never known a better gender in my whole life!  Anyway, this is my input, so thanks for reading mine!|`|L2cLlrJnaa	that is rong, you just dissed yourself|`|EnAtAmHoaa	there are statistics proving the strength of the female mind in comparison to that of the male's. it's significantly more complex and capable of processing, understanding, and grasping more. women are definitely not weak, they are stronger than men emotionally and mentally. and you're one fvcking lucky person if your menstrual cramps are not painful and if you haven't had your heart stomped all over by some *** hole. i push forward everyday even though i have been though hell and back many times and strive to be a strong, independent, free thinking woman who doesn't need a guy to complete her and give her purpose in life.|`|Rwhscdnoaa	I agree on most of this it's so true that men are always paying and pampering girls and now they always expect it! It's like weres are special pampering? I hate how girls can never spend a dime and always get taken care of never have to fight always cheat and still have room to complain! Its not right! And how a guy can't complament a guy with being called gay but a girl have sex with a girl and say oh it was experimenting I mean I treat my girlfriend like that and she isn't like most girls she treasts me equal.
MbjxFaNTaa	whatever comes to your mind first. could be about a sport, school, a job you two are interested in, a color, your friends, how cute puppies are? lol. i don't know. hard to answer such a question when i know nothing about either of you. lol. but, good luck. : j|`|Qe9EULsdaa	That question game thing is a wicked good idea.

cb6ToDZYaa	You probably can't.  That is a huge age difference, and as the mother of a 16 year old girl, I can tell you that it would be a tough pill to swallow for any parent.  If your 21, you are old enough that you don't need your parents approval, but if it is something that means a lot to you, you may have hard times ahead.  All I can say is if you are bound and determined to do this, then you and your boyfriend should tell them together.  Both of you should be very honest and tell your parents how you feel about each other and why the relationship is so important to you.  Tell them that you love them and respect their opinion and don't want to do anything to disappoint them, but you can't always help who you fall in love with.  I still can't tell you that they are ever going to except this, but if you really love him, it's all you can do.  Good luck.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	Oh, I thought you were like 16 dating a 26 year old. Well if you're 21 I guess that's not as bad. My parents are 9 years apart. Like the first person said if your parents love you they will understand, just be careful.|`|K119R72Caa	you just said you don't care what people think. Just tell your parents. I'm sure as long as he treats you right and you care for each other your parents will be fine with it|`|kD0zNJLqaa	dont tl them the age unless they ask<br>  and if they do just subtract 9 years|`|bOtk6QfIaa	If they love u then they will understand|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	What makes you think they would have such a problem with it that they'd shun you? <br>  <br>  I don't think the age difference matters, and I doubt they will think that either, once they see how you are together.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	how old do they think he is, do they know his age?  if not why tell them?  i could see if you were underage then there would be a problem......i would wait and see how serious things get between you two first.....also, do your parents like him, if they do maybe the age thing won't matter so much if they see you are happy and he treats you well.........
naequcqlaa	There's nothing you honestly can do, except keep showing them the same love you had for them when they were together.  Just because the two of them split up, doesn't have any baring on how you feel about them or that you love either of them any less.  They'll both need your love & support as they always have, they still are the same two people as far as you're concerned. I know it's rough on the kids.  I've been there & do realize unfortunately they are the ones in the middle so to speak.  But that still doesn't change all your love for hone another,  Make sure you take good care of you, you're important too...I wish you all the best...:)|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Start a personal journal and write down all your thoughts and feelings. This will give you some control over this situation and help you to organize your emotions. I went through the same thing when I was 14, it hurts but life goes on and every day it hurts a tiny bit less than the day before.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	not a whole lot you can do. just get used to it...it sucks on all counts. just be honest with both of them on what you need in terms of support and interaction.|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	Nothing you can do about it. Continue to love you parents, respect them and go with it.<br>  Someday you'll be out on your own an be distanced from the entire thing. Til then, just support BOTh of you parents. DO not let them put you in the middle of their problems. It's not your problem and you didn't cause the divorce and there is nothing you can do about it.<br>  If your parents try to put you in the middle and make you choose sides then talk with them separately and tell them you love BOTH of them and PLEASE do not do this to you. They love you and will understand and most likely be ashamed of themselves for trying to make you take sides.<br>  Remember honey, "this too shall pass" just enjoy life,your friends and know that you will be able to be on your own someday.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	it not about you its about them.also if one says some bad about the other defend them.who ever you live with let the other one know that you love them|`|X6aYVpU3aa	live you life, move on and continue living, life must go on.|`|IOsrDhrJaa	You should spend more time with your friends so that way you don't have to be around the sadness and turmoil. Give your parents time to deal with their emotions and straighten out their heads. My parents are divorced and I got through it just by giving them space and space to myself while being with my friends. And remember, your parents love you and the last thing they want is you to be effected by any of their problems.

Don't think about anyone like your bf or your father or anything that distracts you. Physically,you can improve yourself,being healthy is achievable and when you're healthy you can think more positively.

The thing is, it hard.. but if he's telling you he loves you and your beautiful, you should believe him. and all guys look at other women, but the only thing you have to remember is that he is your man, and hes coming home with you not them.<br>  trust him girl, thats all you can do.
zCE0slQ5aa	I don't worry in my relationships. I don't enter relationships unless there is potential for a viable, long lasting future. i am direct, honest, and hold nothing back. I never go to sleep upset, confused or with a question on my mind. If a relationship I am in ends it is because that person was dishonest to their spirit and heart.|`|4swYFtsSaa	in a relationship im worried that my gf will dump me from out of no where cause her friends told her to and of course the cheating and i also worry about her ex's being in the same room cause no current bf is no match for an ex the girl has history with
XBCmzuSiaa	well my advice is use long paper and cut them wavy and say happy birthday on it and also you can go to the library and borrow how to bake a cup cake and then so you can use that for a cake because cake is hard to make and long then set up lots of decorations on things and on your house and tell your mom to come back home at 8:00 then you wait her in home and peek on the window when she is coming then when she come tell every one to be ready to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY!|`|0k2y3bNgaa	That is so cute! She will be soo happy that you are doing this for her!<br>  <br>  Hmm anyways, try looking up party ideas on Google and good luck dear!|`|zFb022Iiaa	I'm not sure about the party, but look and see what music was from when she was 20sh.  1990.  Try to have some of that music, bet she would like that.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Maybe talk to your dad about this.  39 is not a key year like 40 is, so if he says no this year, maybe it can happen next year.  If you are a kid, it is not really okay for you to have a party without permission (sorry if you aren't, but when you say your parents have been married for 12 years and mom is 39, you don't sound that old). Parties cost a bit to have, maybe this is an issue for your family too.  How about suggesting to your dad that you could have some family and friends come over for lunch or dinner and everyone brings a plate of food as their present (work it out so you have some of everything - not say too many sweets and not enough salad or bread).  Ask your dad to organize some music your mom likes.  Get some decorations if you have it at home, or maybe you could all go to a park and make a picnic of it.  Good luck.|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	Do the math and determine by what she likes now, what music she must've liked from her ages 18-22, then make a tape of that music for the background.  Get inexpensive party hats and with a felt pen write her name with an exclamation point and 39 with an exclamation point. Get helium balloons, plastic forks, a silly big cake, soft drinks, and salty snacks.  That'll do it.  You can also get crepe paper on a roll and do up the room, her favorite colors.|`|fa5c4f373a8de64cffa0f9041aaa803aaa	Make it festive looking, lots of balloons or streamers. Those are pretty cheap but makes a big impact. Even making a sign for her would be fun. You can ask the people attending to bring a dish for a potluck and you can set up buffet area. <br>  Most important you invite the people she loves and I guarantee she will have a wonderful time.<br>  Hope it's fun!|`|7bba2cecc3b8d0c8d7e003ceea9f79e2aa	ok think about what your mom likes. 80's music? fashion? Then make a party for her with that theme. My mother loves movies, so I organized a party with an 80's movie theme.|`|qlscULoiaa	What about a backyard BBQ.  I don't know where you live but almost anyplace you can BBQ and eat indoors if you have to.  Have all the trimmings, potato chips, etc.  Lots of streamers, balloons etc.   As part of the invite, you can let the family and friends know it is a BYOB Party - Bring Your Own Bottle.  You could supply cola, 7up, etc.<br>  P.S. Men are not too good at "throwing" parties.  Get him to help you out tho.|`|AUuUl8GOaa	how nice :) <br>  send (or hand out) invitations to all her friends. you could even call some of them to invite them.<br>  <br>  pick i night where you or your ddad can go somewhere with her, while one of you stays home waiting with her friends. then SURPRISE
SJx9IWWtaa	Sounds crazy...but I would look for a low priced wedding coordinator.  They are out there, if you were in AZ i could recommend one who will work with people on a $1000 budget lol, and she doesn't charge a lot.<br>  <br>  But, basically it would be someone to sorta sit down and make a game plan, and then they will keep the ball rolling for you.  They'll be the one to announce "Time for the couples first dance" , "Get over here girls to catch the bouquet"<br>  <br>  You can do it yourself too of course.  Basically map it out, and don't be upset if you don't do it perfect.  But think...Greet guests first 30 min, Eat for 45, (toasts usually happen during the eating...after everyone's sitting with there food), do garter toss & bouquet toss...15 min.  Say good by...last 15 min.  lol  And you would literally write this down and try to remember to change subjects when the time is scheduled.|`|6PhSENcXaa	In that case let the people come to you and greet you as they can.  You won't have much time other wise.<br>  At our wedding we had and hour just to greet the guess, we had the hall for 6 hours.  We had 3575 guess at our wedding.  I have 18 siblings and my wife has 8 siblings, plus the rest of the family and friends also.|`|8ygky5g4aa	Since you are having a short reception, I would highly suggest to have a receiving line after the ceremony so that you can personally greet,hug and kiss all your guests.<br>  <br>  Then instead of a sit down dinner reception (because you will not have time) have a punch and cake reception.  First you should do the first dance, bride/father dance etc.  Once that is out of the way do the cake cutting ceremony so that everyone can have cake, punch and any other snack goodies you have.  You can socialize for a while.  Instead of having dancing you may want to have a string quartet or pianist playing back ground music so that you can socialize with everyone.  Near the end do the garter toss and end with the bouquet toss.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Right after the wedding ceremony, form a receiving line outside the church or wherever, and greet each person as they leave the church and you are done. Unless you have a huge crowd, this only takes a few minutes and then go to the reception. This way, every guest will have had a chance to congratulate you and they will not feel weird if you miss speaking to them at the reception.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	At your reception either just before dinner, or after dinner and just before the garter toss, etc start take a few minutes to go to each table and thank each person.  No one really expects to sit down and have a lengthy conversation.
E2OKRhwYaa	Talk to her and tell her exactly that, that you feel like she's putting her boyfriend before your friendship and make sure that she doesn't think you're jealous.

CBa9G4j4aa	I think that is very inappropriate if it's true. Which you may never know unless you catch them. But people can read people so you can tell if he was lying or not and just tell him you're not putting up with stuff like that. You're his one and only.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Oh come on, he is sooooooo lying to you, hon. Those messages are talking about sex, not pool........ get a clue and dump his cheating butt.|`|V6ZahAzvaa	There is definitely something odd about that... And I would not be happy about that at all if I were you... He would definitely have to cut off all communications with her and anyone else like that... even if it means changing numbers|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Yeah i don't think he is telling the truth either. I hope you figure everything out!|`|KExssBP4aa	sorry to be blunt but it's not the end of the world|`|ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	In my opinion, your hubby is acting like a 17 year old who just met the girl of his dreams. He is excited about his new love and just plumb forgot all about you. When you came home, he felt like an idiot for not deleting those texts. So he thought of an excuse for them. You will never guess and trust him so it will be ok.<br>  But, it is not. He has done the unforgivable and will not take responsibility for his actions. There is only one thing to do and that is to tell him to go to her and not come back. He will either get mad and start yelling that there is nothing going on so he doesn`t have to leave.<br>  Or will say he is sorry and will never do it again. Either way I think he<br>  should leave and think about what he has done to you. You can forgive him if you want, but not for awhile. Let him come to terms with what he<br>  did and really think about if he wants you forever or just until you have to go away again. There is outgoing and there is out right hitting on someone.|`|37AMN8scaa	slap his sorry as and kick him intha jewls and telem to fuckoff <br>  and then telem how small his d is <br>  then ifya owna gun shoot em in tha foot and watch him bleed|`|AA10832226	divorce his *** and take his ****... you can get a lot of his stuff and money because he is cheating..|`|85QfzQ5kaa	I would say your smarter than he is obviously. I am sorry to say it but he is so cheating and it probably wasn't the first time.  I would maybe suggest maybe the two of you go to counseling and see if you can figure things out. If he refuses than he isn't worthy of  you. Hang in there and stay strong. I have been where you are. Unfortunately we got divorced over it but I am remarried with four beautiful children. Good luck!
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	$4 grand would be a dream budget for us.  But the average cost of a wedding varies greatly from area to area and will also vary greatly depending upon the # of guests you are having.  I'm in the Northeast USA and its pretty expensive.  This website might help you more specifically based on where you live: <a href="http://www.costofwedding.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.costofwedding.com/</a><br>  <br>  Combined we make a little bit more than you do but we're using savings we accumulated over many years (even before we met) and have been saving for the past 2 years for our wedding this October.  We will come in under budget thanks to my skrimping, cutting things from the list, and real bargain hunting for the things we need.  We are inviting 195 people and know already that about 15 won't be able to show up so we are budgeting based on 180 people and tracking at just a little under $20,000.  We know our final number will be lower as there will be more people that aren't able to attend and that will be where we lower our costs even more.|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	Definitely not overspending. My wedding is at about $5,000 right now, and I'm doing a lot of stuff myself (I'm making my dress, cake and invitations). The church alone is $1,000, and food for 100 people is another couple of thousand. Weddings cost a lot! The average I heard is $25,000 in America.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	I think it depends where you live.  I am in New York and unfortunately the avg here is around around 30,000.  Try this website if you would really like an avg around you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.costofwedding.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.costofwedding.com/</a>|`|MLc8OSQiaa	omg 4 grand is good!!!! my wedding...rings and honeymoon included is costing us 10 grand... but we are somehow able to do it lol|`|U3fwQPcjaa	Apparently the average Australian wedding costs around $36,234, but I think that that's a bit over the top, we are budgeting for $15,000, and that is being Conservative as we are paying for our own wedding, this is not including the honeymoon. Mind you that things cost less in America and there is much more competition which helps to drive the cost down, so I would say that $4,000 isn't too expensive, perhaps you just need to sit him down and show him exactly what there is to pay for.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	No, the average American wedding these days is $29,000 so you are doing a good job.

My sister's ended up being around $10,000 for about 250 guests.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	The average cost of a wedding depends upon where you live. Some areas are simply more expensive than others. For example, in my area the average cost of a wedding is almost $30,000. We're trying to do it for $10,000 and it's taken a lot of research, leg work, and cutting back on the extras like a limo and such, to stay on budget. <br>  <br>  Also, it depends upon how many guests you're having. We're expecting about 80 people. <br>  <br>  I don't think you're overspending at all. I wish I could only spend $4,000. I could move my wedding date up, rather than having to wait until 2010.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	well maybe that is too much. you can just go to mc donalds.

sriByWZBaa	I understand that you may be going through times where you're exhausted and bitter about everything in life. Even though bad things come, it doesn't mean your WHOLE life will be bad. My advise for you is to look things positively and look forward to something. Everyone has some kind of family problems but that's when you need to talk it out altogether and grow as a better family. Don't let stress bother you in school. Figure out a way to take away that stress and do a hobby or something you love. Maybe when you get good grades your parents will realize how great and smart person you can become!

You can't stop your bad behavior ?? you are very confused. Try just behaving in her class for the rest of the year, try your hardest and think about your actions before going forward.

You best learn to get along with people and just respect them - you don't have to like them - but respect them.

What she should do is meet his parents soon and see if she is accepted, and if not, to move on. A relationship usually does not work when a set of parents disagree with their sons/daughters mate. It may at first, but it eventually deteriorates over time. This is really something that should be found out waaaay better sooner than later. Tell your friend to try to meet the parents in a week or 2 and see what happens.|`|AA11743770	rase should not matter! if u like someone you should be able to like him no matter what rase he is!!|`|AA12298737	Hun tell your friend that race is nothing.it is uncontrolable.So if she really likes this boy she won't care what anybodys has to say because it is him and her not anybody else.

fa5e73ae8094d599691b8e9bfed3c84baa	you may want to start by caring for him (as a gd friend will, not as a galfriend yet), hopefully he will see the better part of you, and likes you gradually. You never know the results, unless you try. <br>  <br>  But it's a gd start at least he likes you as a friend. Do be sensible and thoughtful to him, don't push him to like you, or be a nuisance and stick to him everywhere he goes, guys hate that! If you have tried and still he have no bf/gf feelings towards you, then I think you should move on.|`|28584feccbb51bac93f234f67c5909b0aa	as a friend - that is the start!

Don't make it so ovisous that you are just there friend play with you hair and tease with them. Then you'll know if he likes you or not. Most likely yes let him know that you don't care say hi whatever his name is that you like and keep going stay somewhere close to were he is and be loud wear a short tight dress with heels.By the end of the party he'll be all yours|`|AA10814863	Well not ever one you like will like you to!!! some times it works out that way.

There are plenty of boys out there and you need to realize that cuz everybody gets there hearts broke|`|86d5c45e9900b98294c35e1a4b8eace0aa	alright you all arent dating so by him looking and talking to other girls shouldnt make you as jealous as u seem to be. If you really like this guy you would know if he likes you.

He might not actually be your type but may be just ending up to be a really cool friend. If he's not interested then don't get upset your 13 and you are really young you'll get to like new guys every week and some will break your heart and others you'll break theres. Just remember no matter what in time you always get over what you've been through especially guys. okay take care aND i hope this helps you.|`|9181b26f76f473ef3f2e9dfd2542d30aaa	First try not to be so obssesive, it only makes matters worse- but the only thing you can do is be yourself and show him how great that person is.

6a4a4fa8e0ef25d6491f887ed4c35ce7aa	Love is a basic dimension of human experience that is variously conveyed as a sense of tender affection, an intense attraction, the foundation of intimacy and good interpersonal chemistry, willing self-sacrifice on behalf of another, and as an ineffable sense of affinity or connection to nature, other living beings, or even that which is unseen. It manifests itself in feelings, emotion, behavior, thoughts, perception and attitude. It influences, underlies and defines major patterns in interpersonal relationships and self-identification. It can be measured like Love for friends, family, even pets.love is not amenable to one authoritative definition.<br>  <br>  On the other hand marraige is a vow to stay together between one man and woman until death do them part. legitimizing sexual relations and procreation; social stability; education and development of offspring; transfer of property; security; and companionship, or any of such combinations.

95632ba66a21ca0ca3f6e60a2d76d81caa	Algunos estan respondiendo sin leer! Esta muy mal que la psicologa no la quiera atender, esa persona no merece llevar su titulo. Por otro lado, si no puedes mencionar el tema ya que le hace da?o, no lo menciones a menos que ella este dispuesta a hablarlo. Es un hecho que les afecto a los 2 como pareja y les hace da?o a ambos. Debes hacerla sentir bien, recordarle que puede confiar en ti como siempre, dejar esto en el pasado como algo para recordar de no repetir. Quizas no solo ella deberia ir al psicologo si no tu tambien. Ella te ama y eso ya esta claro porque esta muy arrepentida, tu debes concentirla mucho ahora y esperar que pase el tiempo para que se calme el tema, y puedan seguir con su vida normalmente.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Tu me vas a disculpar pero ninguna infelidad tiene razón de ser si existe el amor y respeto en una relación,  y sobre todo si hay hijos de por medio. Independientemente de que la hayas tratado mal como tu dices eso no era se?al para que la empujaras a cometer adulterio. No será que ella por la falta que cometio contigo ahora este dando lástima para que la perdones. Mas bien te felicito, eres un gran caballero, hombre y la amas de verdad, porque otro la hubiese mandado a la porra. Claro cada quien es diferente y eso lo respeto. Pero te aconsejo mientras la sigas escuchando en sus quejas y llevandola a médicos con eso no conseguiras nada. Te aconsejo no le hagas caso, dile que ya lo olvidaste y que no vas a permitir que eso siga afectando la vida de los dos y de los ni?os. Hazla reaccionar con carácter(es decir sin gritarle sino ignorandola cuando hable del temita) a ver que pasa. Con eso se le quitará eso que tiene para que tu la mimes más bien por lo que hizo.Disculpame si soy fuerte, pero es mi opinión y lo que siento al leer tu pregunta. Veo como te mencione arriba, que eres un hombre noble y más bien te estas culpando por un error y un pecado que cometio ella contigo.  Y era normal que tu reaccionaras como lo hiciste en recordarle su error. YA BASTA PONLE PUNTO FINAL A ESTO. VIDA NUEVA Y LO PASADO QUEDO ATRAZ. Dicelo con carácter que no vas a permitir que siga recordandote lo que ocurrio. Que ya lo olvidaste, y NO TE SIGAS CULPANDO TU POR QUE LA MALTRATASTE VERBALMENTE SI ESTABAS EN PROBLEMAS CON LA MUERTE DE TU PADRE. Si ella no lo comprendió, es su problema. Pero es lindo que a pesar de lo que te hizo tu la ayudes y pienses que fue tuya la culpa.  NO CREO QUE EXISTA NINGUNA COSA O SITUACION EN LA VIDA QUE OBLIGUE A UNA PERSONA A SERLE INFIEL A OTRA Y MENOS SIENDO ESPOSA O ESPOSO. Y si ocurre y se perdonan. Pués sigan adelante y ya. Todo se olvida. Pero tienes que poner de tu parte porque ya está bueno. A pesar de que al que le montaron los cuernos fue a tí, también te sientes culpable. POR FAVOR AMIGO ABRE LOS OJOS. Y si la perdonastes, ya basta de que continue ella con ese tin tin tin por favor. Suerte y que esta pesadilla de tu mujer se quite pronto. Besos.<br>  P.D. De veras te admiro. Ojala todos los hombres fuesen como tú de entender y comprender algo como esto. Así como todas o casí todas las mujeres que nos han montado los cuernos casi siempre somos las que perdonamos.Dile que si no pone de su parte y sigue con ese temita va a da?ar la relación por completo a ver como lo toma. O no le hagas más caso a ver si se queda tranquila, porque si le sigues haciendo caso seguira con lo mismo. Es su culpa no tuya. Asi amigo que para adelante y no permitas que esto se convierta en algo peor para ustedes. Cambién de rutina, salgan a sitios diferentes no hablen del tema, cuando ella empiece, la paras en seco y dile que no quieres seguir hablando de este tema y ya. Suerte y besos.<br>  P.D. DILE QUE ASI COMO TU SUPERASTE QUE ELLA TE HAYA SIDO INFIEL, QUE ELLA TAMBIEN SUPERE LO QUE HIZO PORQUE ESO NO LOS LLEVARA A NADA BUENO.<br>  Y SI DE VERDAD LA PERDONASTE, QUEDATE TRANQUILO OLVIDA Y DEJA TU TAMBIéN EL TIN TIN TIN DE ESTARSELO RECORDANDO A CADA RATO.

A veces de todas formas me enojo, pero no se o hago saber por que así no llegaremos a ningún lado.<br>  Un amigo me dijo: "el que invento el orgullo no estaba enamorado"<br>  Si la ama y además tiene 3 hijos lucha por tu relación, todos nos equivocamos alguna vez y puede ser que tu también lo hagas y esperaras y te encantaría que ella te perdonara.<br>  Olvida eso y sigue adelante que la vida no hay que tomársela tan en serio total nadie sale vivo de ella y no hay nada mejor que estar con la persona que amas.<br>  Suerte!!!!

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Por falta de RESPETO hacia el ser humano, independientemente de la inclinación sexual que tenga una persona, se debe respetar. Pienso que todos los seres humanos merecemos respeto de los otros. Pero acuerdate que vivimos en un mundo de intolerancia hacia todo. En cuanto a tu situación no eres el único, conozco algunos gays que son rechazados también por considerarlos ANORMALES cosa que no es así, ya que son personas como cualquier otra, profesionales, estudiantes, de familia, etc. pero la única diferencia es su inclinación sexual. Acuerdate que no todo el mundo tiene la mente abierta para comprender eso. Sigue adelante trata de superarte en la vida y ponte una coraza para que la discriminación no te afecte, ya que eso lo encontrarás en todas partes y siempre, debes de ser fuerte ya que tú no serás el primero ni el último que le pase eso. Es lo único que me sale del corazón para decirte. Saludos y cuidate.<br>  P.D. Soy mujer heterosexual y me gustan los hombres, pero he aprendido a respetar a todos por igual. En cuanto a pareja, visita a sitios donde frecuenten personas con tus mismas inclinaciones sexuales, bares gays, etc. Pero eso sí, cuidate para que no te peguen ninguna enfermedad venerea ok. usa condones siempre, y eso no es para tí nada más sino para todos nosotros los seres humanos, pero en el mundo gays es más posible el contagio del SIDA y tu ya lo deberías de saber.

Hay páginas de internet para gays, pero yo no le entraría a eso, la verdad es que hay mucho loco, y gay, peor (la neta, hay gays muy desubicados).

The best way is to get a big group of friends to go out to a hockey game, a movie and then slip it into conversation  about how you had fun and you " we should do this again" look for his repsonse and then ask for his phone number, and set up a fun date.

Estoy segura que lo vas a superar pero si necesitas ayuda te aconsejo que acudas a alguien que te pueda dar consejos. Yo creo k tu papa que te ve desde el cielo quiere que estes bien y e va a desepcionar de ti si pierdes tu fe en Dios. todo el mundo ha perdido a alguien querido, te voy a contar una historia para que entiendas mejor de lo que se trata esto...<br>  <br>  Erase una vez un se?or que acudía a la iglesia todos los dias y se incaba sobre el altra a rogarle a jesus quedejara que el se pusiera en su lugar para que el pudiera descansar un poco. después de muchas visitas seguidas y de haberle rogado tanto Jesús acepto con una simple condició; que el se?or iba a estar ahi pero viendo todo lo que hacia la gente en la iglesia pero no podia hablar para nada con nadie;muy feliz el hombre acepto y se quedó ahi.<br>  mas tarde llega otro hombre a la Iglesia a rezar y olvida sin querer ahi su cartera, llega otro pobre ni?o a rezar y al ver la cartera olvidada la toma y se va. Un rato después llega una mujer y el primero, al darse cuanta de que habia olvidado su cartera, regresa a buscarla y encontrando ahi a la se?ora y no a su cartera, la culpa a ella de habersela robado. El hombre que estaba en el puesto de Jusus no aguanto ver que culparan a la inocente se?ora de algo que no habia hecho y habló explicand la situación, etonces el se?or de la cartera salio corriendo en busca del ni?o y cuando lo encontro le quito la cartera y se fue apurado a tomar el barco para el rucero al que se iba ese dia.<br>  <br>  En ese momento llega Jesús a la Iglesia a rega?ar al hombre y le éxplica la situación: el ni?o que se habia robado la cartera necesitabael dinero para comprar medicinas para su madre gravementre enferma, y el se?or que habia perdido la cartera era un adinerado que tomaria un barco que se hundiría ese día, pero discutiendo con la se?ora que supuestamente le habia robado la cartera perderia el barco y se salvaria. Al haber hablado en hombre en el lugr de jesus cambio el curso de las cosas solo porque el no entendia las razones y decidio que era injusto segun su juicio.<br>  <br>  MORALEJA: solo Dios entiendo porque hace las cosas<br>  <br>  SUERTE y saludos, te deseo lo mejor y no pierdas la fe|`|c33b66d176189e1339e2292f39634b15aa	creo que Dios sabe bien lo que hace!. quizás debas aprender la situación que hoy enfrentas con la ausencia de tu Padre. a lo mejor Dios lo necesita mucho más que a vos arriba. todo tiene una explicación para nuestro Padre del Cielo, comparto tu dolor, pero aprende a vivir sin él y con los mejores recuerdos juntos.Sigue creyendo en Dios , yo sé que en algun momento nos encontraremos con aquellos sere queridos y perdidos.no es una fantasía lee la Biblia y encontrarás respuestas correctas y exactas, dios nos está mirando permanentemente a todos.aviva tuFé en Jesús y pidele por tu padre para que esté junto a Dios.-|`|d342c1d25a54e1bf7b7415f4baa6758faa	Amiga, no reniegues de Dios, .........sabes siempre escuche decir que las personas buenas se van antes, entonces, quiere decir que tu papito era un elegido de Dios, por lo tanto te tienes que sentir feliz que tu papi ya esta con El y es privilegiado, siempre mira el lado bueno de las cosas que te pasan, nunca lo malo, se que es facil decirlo y escribirlo, dificil aceptarlo, pero el tiempo lo cura todo, ahora tu papito paso a mejor vida, y te digo algo, ahora si tu papi esta siempre contigo, comunicate con El, hablale, y el sabra responderte con pequenas cosas, que tu ni te imaginas.

Pero puede ser el caso que tenga miedo de que ella salga a estudiar y pueda conocer a  otro y esto pasa porque no tiene confianza en su pareja. Que lindo si la dejara estudiar porque sería un beneficio no solo para ella, sino para los dos. Pero a veces se ven tipos machistas que quieren que la mujer no se supere y que esté metida fregando en la casa.

Y si es así, buscate a una de tu país y deja a las Venezolanas tranquilas.<br>  <br>  ANTONIO PUDE LEER TODAS TUS PREGUNTAS, Y ESTAN DIRIGIDAS AL MISMO TEMA, PORQUE NO MENCIONAS QUE LE MENTISTE EMPEZANDO LA RELACIóN Y POR ESO ELLA TE DIJO QUE SU CORAZóN SE LE ESTABA ENFRIANDO Y POR ESO NO CONFIA EN Tí ????????????<br>  <br>  Firma: Una Venezolana!!!!|`|d6898635eca991135badb25629a8fb66aa	Puede que si, puede que no, cada persona es un mundo, la nacionalidad no tiene nada que ver|`|5c9943f0caabf1bb4f35797314edc9e3aa	felicidades.|`|7f39d68c69f2416588d8c5e4d0168b9caa	No, fijate que solo las mujeres de los paises nordicos lo son.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Es sarcasmo, no puedes generalizar por nacionalidad algo que es tan particular de cada quien.|`|83df66738454a008625e40a8be57d354aa	la mayoría de las mujeres somos fiel sea de donde sea haste la pregunta tu donde hay hombres fieles ni debajo de la tierra|`|R1Z3uWlUaa	Nene te voy a decir una cosa, mira tu mano... tienes 5 dedos(espero)  y los 5 dedos son de la misma mano y todos son distintos, no puedes esperar que una nacionalidad te de la respuesta a si es fiel o no alguna persona, se supone que las colombianas somos fieles y en general es así, pero he visto cada cosa.

cPnBJUKhaa	Lo mejor es empezar a leerla por el Nuevo Testamento, en los Evangelios (Marcos Mateo Lucas y Juan) porque ahi hablan de la vida de Jesús<br>  <br>  De ahi pasate a Hechos de los Apostoles y terminas el Nuevo Testamento<br>  <br>  Y ya terminado eso, sigues con el Antiguo Testamento, donde todavia no esta Jesús y se habla de el como una profecía.<br>  <br>  Es como mejor le vas a entender<br>  <br>  Suerte! y ojala que te sirva leerla|`|C6kXKo8Waa	Pues culaquier religion que su base sea cristo, y sus evangelios es la indicada, yo soy una novata como tu, aunque vengo de una religion catolica, me senti mas agusto y mas identificada con la bautista, evangelista o cristiana que vienen siendo lo mismo, pues en ellas me resolvieron muchas dudas, incluso me ense?aron a tener mejor comunicacion con Dios y aprendi a leer la biblia.<br>  <br>  Pero si por alguna parte tienes que empezar es por pedirle al Espiritu Santo que te ilumine antes de empezar a leerla pues hay muchas veces que al principio no entendemos nada, como palabras o partes de el evangelio; Asi que yo te aconsejo que primero empiezes por pedirle al espiritu santo que te de luz en tus ojos y entendimiento y que el espiritu santo entre en ti para que puedas entenderla, y despues empiezes por el nuevo testamento, que es cuando cuentan del nacimiento de jesus en delante, pero si no sabes nada de nada, de como se creo todo, y quien es Dios, empieza por genesis, cada parte de la biblia tiene un numero grande a su izq.que es el capitulo y al lado un # peque?o que es el versiculo segun cada capitulo, si llegas a encontrar una letra entre parentesis ejemplo...(a)...al final de una oracion, eso quiere decir que mas abajo de la hoja vendra un significado o una explicacion de lo que ahy te dicen, si es posible cuando vayas a comprar una biblia dile al que te la vaya a vender que sea lo mas explicita posible para que tu puedas leerla y entenderla mejor, te recomiendo la editora valera reyna es muy entendible...suerte y si tienes dudas preguntame y si en algo te puedo ayudar lo hare con gusto...<br>  brachoe@hotmail.com...SUERTE !!|`|I75oTAvMaa	En la actualidad hay varias Biblias, la mayoría en las primeras hojas te dicen como tienes que ir leyéndola.

En lo particular me encantan los Salmos, los cuales entiendo y son muy bonitos y  trato en lo posible todos los días leer uno. Cuando aprendes a análizarlos es muy interesante cada escritura de la Bilbia. Siempre y cuando no te pongas fanático de lo que lees sino que trates de aplicar esos consejos que nos transmite esos mensajes. En principal como tratar al prójimo como a tí mismo.|`|048e7177d16fd8ed5cc3d000dd9eb6deaa	lo mejor es que busques a laguien y te explique.|`|4jYtWoSdaa	solo un evangelista te puede ayudara interpretar como se lee uno soy yo estudiante otro mi hermano y mi apa ambos pastores evangelicos contactame. la primera tarea comiensa a leer los evangelios y los hechos de los apostoles  estos los primeros Libros de Nuevo Testamento|`|727038d4d32295f04cb465f1cf5ef85faa	pues mira soy atea pero pso la habres y la lees como si fuera una novelita o una recopilacion de cuentitos inventados por humanos jaja a sorry eso son jajaja<br>  <br>  no kiero ofender a nadie pero me e leido dos veces la biblia y tienen q aceptar q es como un cuentito por ke todo todo es metaforico y no puedes tomarlo como ciencia o verdad absoluta...<br>  <br>  auqn tiene un buen contenido historico noe s ciencia<br>  <br>  me ayudas?  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArjWUNkkKvXwmFzw3Ivca_aY8gt.?qid=20070411104741AA7utiK">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|bnSY0k2Iaa	mm no estoi segura<br>  <br>  soi catolica y abres la biblia lees lo que tu quieras de pie y al terminar te persinas (ya sabes "en el nombre del padre. hijo y espiritu santo amén) y ya es todo y creo que le das un beso a la biblia pero de eso no estoy mu segura<br>  <br>  suerte con  tu acercamiento a dios :)|`|tAH2Ogvmaa	con los ojos jiji!!

Si de verdad ella te quiere como tu a ella, lo hará. Ten un poquito de dignidad y quierete y respetate más. Tienes razón al decir que a pesar de que ella te trató mal y como cualquier cosa tu NO DEBERíAS DE BUSCARLA, no es hablar de torcer el brazo, es hablar de RESPETO HACIA TI MISMO, SI TU NO TE QUIERES NO PODRáS QUERER A NADIE, NI A TI MISMO. Te aconsejo que le des tiempo al tiempo, que es lo que arregla las cosas. Y acuerdate del refrán que dice: <br>  <br>  SI AMAS ALGO, DEJALO LIBRE, SI VUELVE A TI, ES TUYO PERO SI NO VUELVE.......NUNCA LO FUE.<br>  A veces no debemos de obligar a las situaciones porque después nos va peor. Tal vez con esta separación y tu espera, puedas enamorarte de otra que valore TU AMOR. Y cuando en las parejas se pierde el respeto, pienso que es mejor dejar las cosas hasta ahí, ya que es seguro que se vuelvan a repetir ese tipo de hechos donde hay ofensas e insultos, y nadie se merece que lo traten como cualquier cosa, y menos si es tu pareja.<br>   Suerte y ojala encuentres a otra chica. Besitos.|`|2edbe5d604bbb817837f38c260b0b14eaa	Por ahí lee todas tus lamentaciones y requiebros por este sitio y la suerte te acompa?a.|`|944171eb5c24e10afa704f801c3375deaa	Hola Alex... me siento realmente conmovida por tu pregunta, ya que yo estoy pasando exactamente por la misma situación y además tengo los mismos sentimientos que tú... eso que dices que quieres saber si una vez te amo, es una pregunta que me está matando y me come por dentro... hace un par de semanas le mande un mail a mi ex, solo preguntandole como estaba... nunca lo respondió. Entonces supongo que no quiere saber nada de mi, pero se que por lo menos lo intenté. ?Porque no haces lo mismo? te ayudará a sondear el terreno, tal vez obtengas una respuesta positiva, pero creo que debes ser muy cauteloso, si le haces saber que tu la amas puede que ella te vuelva a hacer lo mismo. Creo que es mejor que todo lo hagas en plan de amigos y no apresurarte demasiado. <br>  Siembra una amistad con ella y con el tiempo tal vez las cosas sean diferentes. Mucha suerte.|`|bivuGBByaa	Hola, tú sabes que lo correcto es recuperar tu autoestima, respetarte, pero te gana el corazón chico, ya reacciona y no busques pretextos para seguir en lo mismo, deja de sentirte′como si nadie sufriera como tu, todos hemos pasado por lo mismo y aquí estamos, es dificil pero no hay otro camino, limpia tu vida de todo esto despeja tu mente y pues... mucha suerte...p.d. NO LA BUSQUES|`|ef7f0f636072189c2c27739d91d3ad21aa	Lamentablemente no puedes obligar a otro ser humano que te ame.  El amor es de dos personas, no de uno.  A veces tenemos que dejar ir a la persona amada.  Como dice el poema, dejala ir, si es tuya volvera, si no vuelve nunca fue tuya.  Pero no permitas que nadie te trate mal.  Tu mereces respeto.  Cuando alguien ama realmente a una persona la quiere y respeta por encima de todo.  Trata de distraerte, mantenerte ocupado en otras cosas.  creeme, mientras menos tiempo libre tengas, menos vas a pensar en ella.|`|jTXsQ6uxaa	Si te trato como cualquier cosa creo que tu no debes buscarla si lo hizo una vez no dudará en hacerlo dos veces olvidate de ella y no la busques más pero si te quieres arriesgar porque verdaderamente la amas de ves decirle lo que todavía sientes pero te digo que si te trato mal no vale la pena.|`|70bd1065230f5f11eb7e85b44b043594aa	"Agarra al toro por los cuernos y enfréntate", pero primero llévale una serenata con canciones románticas, a las mujeres nos gusta que nos enamoren así. Esto sería  muy bueno porque ya casi nadie le lleva serenata a su amor.<br>  Esta es una forma de reiniciar un encuentro.|`|rHC2b4Gvaa	Un ser que ama a otro trata en lo posible de no hacer sufrir a la persona amada.<br>  Para mi parecer ella no te ama ni te amó, se que vas a sufrir, porque yo también sufrí en ese momento, la gente juega con los sentimientos y si tu le dices que la amas ella te va a volver hacer lo mismo.<br>  Todos hemos sufrido por amor alguna vez en la vida, pero no nos hemos muerto, se fuerte y no la busques ya encontraras en la vida alguien que te ame verdaderamente y que aprecie tu amor, hoy pasas por una tormenta pero ma?ana sin tu darte cuenta  vendrá la calma tu vida.<br>  Un beso y adelante, mira siempre hacia adelante.

Llevale algún día un chocolate o dile que te acompa?e a tu casa, o meriendan juntos, o hacen las tareas juntos, en fin se audaz un poquito. Y si cortaste con tu novio por él, no dejes escapar la oportunidad, ya que como dices tú también le gustas a él, entonces pon también tu de tu parte para que el se de cuenta que a tí también te importa. Suerte.<br>  P.D. También podrías programar una salida a un parque, una piscina, un club, un cine y hacer un grupo peque?o de amigos y amigas  y lo invitas, si te da pena o te sientes muy timida para invitarlo tú, dile a una de tus amigas o amigos de él que le avisen y en ese paseo tal vez, se concrete algo entre ustedes.

BSE1aPikaa	no se cual seria la falta, pero si no te llama es o por que ella no cree que sea tanta la falta o por que no le interesa arreglar el asunto. cuando una persona esta arrepentida delo que hizo, busca como arreglar las cosas y si no es asi pues realmente no vale la pena. ahora si quieres llamala tu, pues ella talvez no vio ninguna falta en lo que hizo.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Si ella fue la que cometió la falta, es la que debería buscarte y pedirte disculpas.

Acuerdate que nadie es inalcanzable proponte en conseguirla, enviale regalos, hablale y darle a entender que te gusta. Tal vez con eso, ella se abrirá y te demostrará si tu le gustas o no. Nunca digas NO PUEDO y valorate más, quierete y no te menosprecies al decir eso. Claro, si fuese un artista pienso que ellos si son a veces inalcanzables, no porque sean más que uno, pero son dificiles de encontrar o viven muy lejos de nosotros, pero NO PORQUE SEAN MEJORES. Ponte siempre una meta en tí, ERES MEJOR, ERES LO MáXIMO, TU PUEDES, etc, trata de hacer siempre afirmaciones positivas Y SUBE ESE ANIMO AMIGO. SUERTE.

5096af8d3db1f8259b071461b8396ac2aa	Un hombre tenía dos hijos. El menor dijo a su padre: ¨Padre, dame la parte de la herencia que me corresponde.¨ Y el padre les repartió la herencia. A los pocos días el hijo menor reunió todo lo suyo, se fue a un país lejano y allí gastó toda su fortuna llevando una mala vida. <br>    <br>  <br>  - Dios es tu Padre que te ama infinitamente. Vivir en la casa del Padre, es vivir al lado de Dios, amándolo, cumpliendo sus mandamientos, haciendo su voluntad. <br>  Sin embargo, Dios te hizo LIBRE y tu puedes escoger marcharte a buscar una vida según tú mas fácil, más divertida, sin reglas, sin límites,<br>  pensando que ahí serás feliz.<br>  El ¨ país lejano es el mundo en el que se ignora todo lo que en casa se considera sagrado. Dejar la casa, es escoger vivir el PECADO.<br>  Piensa detenidamente... hay veces que tú actúas como el hijo menor: te sientes libre porque haces lo que quieres, esté bien o mal. Cada vez que te marches, piensa en el dolor que esta elección tuya traerá al corazón del Padre. <br>   <br>  BUSCAS LA FELICIDAD<br>  DONDE NO ESTá<br>  <br>  Cuando se lo había gastado todo, sobrevino una gran hambre en aquella comarca y comenzó <br>  a padecer necesidad. Se fue a servir a casa de un hombre del país, que le mandó a sus tierras a cuidar cerdos. Gustosamente hubiera llenado su estómago con las algarrobas que comían los cerdos pero nadie se las daba.<br>  <br>    <br>  - El hijo malgastó todo lo que le había dado su Padre, cayó muy bajo llegando a pasar hambre.<br>  - Cuando usas la herencia (todo lo bueno que te dio Dios) para mal, cuando vives buscando el éxito, el ser importante, el placer, el pasártela cómodo y bien... el darte gusto a ti antes que a los otros... el tener muchas cosas, el sentirte querido y aceptado por los demás ... puedes hacer lo que quieras, sin embargo .... te sientes vacío, incompleto, solo, triste, abandonado, decepcionado. Entonces descubres que en la vida egoísta y de pecado NO ESTA LA FELICIDAD VERDADERA. <br>  ? SIEMPRE PUEDES VOLVER A CASA DEL PADRE <br>  <br>  Entonces, reflexionando, dijo: ¨?Cuántos jornaleros de mi padre tienen pan de sobra, mientras que yo aquí me muero de hambre! Me pondré en camino, volveré a casa de mi padre y le diré:<br>  ¨ Padre, he pecado contra el cielo y contra ti. Ya no merezco llamarme hijo tuyo, trátame como a uno de tus jornaleros.¨ Se puso en camino y fue a casa de su padre.<br>  <br>  - Tienes dos opciones: una, sentarte y decir:<br>  ¨? Qué malo he sido! ¨ , otra, ser humilde y decir:<br>  ¨Padre, he pecado, me arrepiento, perdóname.¨<br>  Si, no importa lo bajo que hayas caído, siempre puedes arrepentirte, pedir perdón y volver a empezar.<br>  El sacramento de LA CONFESIóN es el camino para volver a la casa del Padre. <br>  <br>  ? CóMO ME RECIBIRá EL PADRE ? <br>  <br>  Cuando aún estaba lejos, su padre lo vió y se conmovió. Fue corriendo, se echó al cuello de su hijo y lo cubrió de besos. El hijo comenzó a decir: ¨ Padre, he pecado contra el cielo y contra tì. Ya no merezco llamarme hijo tuyo.¨ Pero el padre dijo a sus criados: ¨Traed enseguida el mejor vestido y ponédselo; ponedle también un anillo en la mano y sandalias en los pies. Tomad el ternero cebado, matadlo y celebremos un banquete de fiesta, porque este hijo mío había muerto y ha vuelto a la vida, se había perdido y ha sido encontrado.¨ Y se pusieron todos a festejarlo.<br>  <br>   <br>  - ? El amor que Dios te tiene a ti es el más grande amor que puede haber: es infinito, es gratuito, es misericordioso, no pide explicaciones, siempre perdona, siempre te recibe alegre con los brazos abiertos... corre, te abraza y te cubre de besos!   <br>  EL HIJO MAYOR<br>  <br>  El hijo mayor estaba en el campo y, al volver y acercarse a la casa, oyó la música y los bailes. Llamó a uno de los criados y le preguntó qué significaba aquello. . Y éste le contestó: ¨Ha vuelto tu hermano y tu padre ha matado el ternero cebado porque lo ha recobrado sano.¨<br>  El se enfadó y no quiso entrar y su padre salió y se puso a convencerlo. él contestó a su padre: Hace ya muchos a?os que te sirvo sin desobedecer jamás tus órdenes, y nunca me diste ni un cabrito para celebrar una fiesta con mis amigos. Pero llega este hijo tuyo, que se ha gastado tu patrimonio con prostitutas, y tú le matas el ternero cebado.¨<br>  El padre le respondió: ¨Hijo, tu estás siempre conmigo y todo lo mío es tuyo. Pero tenemos que alegrarnos y hacer fiesta porque este hermano tuyo estaba muerto y ha vuelto a la vida; estaba perdido y ha sido encontrado.¨<br>  <br>   <br>  - El hijo mayor sirve, obedece las órdenes del Padre, pero... no con amor desinteresado. Vive en casa del Padre, pero interiormente está lejos del Padre.<br>  - A veces en el mundo hay más hijos mayores: hombres rectos que por afuera trabajan y cumplen sus obligaciones, se ven buenos, sin embargo, interiormente llevan esta vida como una carga, esperan que todo se les admire y agradezca, están llenos de amargura, orgullo, egoísmo, resentimiento, celos y envidia. <br>    <br>  - Estos hombres tampoco pueden encontrar la verdadera felicidad.<br>  - Reflexiona ? vivo yo como el hijo mayor? <br>  ?Tengo el valor de reconocer que a veces mi buena conducta, no es tan transparente como parece? ?Me arrepiento de esto? ?Còmo puedo curarme si tantas veces he tratado con mis propias fuerzas de cambiar? Solo puedo ser curado desde arriba, desde Dios. Si para mí es imposible, para Dios no hay nada imposible.<br>  <br>  EL GRAN AMOR DE DIOS <br>  - Los dos hijos necesitan el perdón de Dios, el sanar. Los dos necesitan volver a casa. Los dos necesitan el abrazo de un Padre misericordioso.<br>  El Padre nunca compara a sus dos hijos, los ama por igual. Si todos los hombres tenemos por igual el amor de Dios ?por qué vivimos comparándonos unos con otros?<br>  - Tu felicidad verdadera proviene de saber que que eres ¨HIJO¨ de Dios, que El te ama infinitamente, de una manera gratuita y que siempre tiene los brazos abiertos para recibirte de regreso|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Te recomiendo la pagina web. www. amen-amen.com ahi encontraras fotos, videos, imagenes. en fin de todo lo que buscas o bien puedes también buscar en www.shoshan.com en esa pagina también encontrarás lo que buscas.

El debe creerte porque tus palabras irán acompa?adas de acciones concretas que demuestran que la teoría sí se lleva a efecto en la práctica.<br>  Otra cosa que molesta es cuando las mujeres están demasiado apegadas a su madre, su padre o sus hermanos, poniéndolos a ellos como prioridad.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Jorge si ella tiene SEPARACIóN DE CUERPOS firmada por un abogado, no tienen problemas ustedes. Ahora bien, si ella esta separada pero sin la firma de ese documento él solo puede alegar que ella le fue infiel aunque sea lo contrario y puede hasta quitarle la patria potestad de su hija.<br>  <br>  Si él fue el que decidió irse de la casa de ambos ella puede alegar abandono de hogar y rápido le dan el divorcio y el documento de separación de cuerpos antes que le salga el divorcio.<br>  <br>  Ten por seguro que ese tipo ya estará saliendo con varias mujeres, pero ya sabes como es la justicia cuando se trata de las mujeres. Por eso te aconsejo que le digas a tu novia que tenga a la mano ese documento de SEPARACIóN DE CUERPOS, ya que sería un alegato a su favor a la hora de él querer reclamar algo. Este documento lo puede solicitar en una Prefectura o se lo solicita a un abogado.<br>  <br>  Ella puede alegar en el documento de separación de cuerpos que el la maltrataba física y psicológicamente, sería bueno que ella se adelantara en eso, ya que alegando esos maltratos el divorcio le sale bien rápido. Lo importante es dejar constancia escrita de eso.

UO62SuR8aa	Ve al juzgado en donde se este llevando tu juicio, y con una credencial de elector o algun documento que te identifique pide el expediente segun el numero que tengas. Leelo y sacale copias. Busca un abogado que te asesore para que te diga como va la situación, todo debe estar ahi. Si no estas trabajando, ve al seguro social a que te den una hoja que no recuerdo como se llama, pero que indica la fecha en la que no cotizas por falta de trabajo, y tenla en la mano por si la necesitas, pregunta al abogado si cree prudente que la presentes en el juzgado. Mientras tanto solo guardala hasta saber que hacer. Pidele a un amigo que con un pretexto vaya a la antigua dirección y pregunte por ella, puede decir que tienen un paquete en el paqueteria de Fedex por ejemplo y no lo ha ido a recoger o algo parecido. De cualquier forma, busca asesoria. Los juzgados no actuan por si solos, todo es en base a procesos, algunos se llevan tiempo si las personas interesadas no presionan, si no te han mandado ningun papel o aviso es probable que ella no este haciendo nada. Pero vuelvo a repetir, asesorate y revisa el expediente, es mejor.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Si estas atrazado es por culpa de no tener empleo. Te aconsejo que te dirijas al Juez  donde te presentabas y le informes que no tienes empleo y por ende no puedes pasarle la manutención a tu hijo y que deseas que eso quede escrito en el expediente. Ya que debes de tener un expediente abierto si ya antes te presentabas. Es mejor que te adelantes antes de que ella te acuse nuevamente.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a tu hijo, deberías de buscarlo, ya esta adolescente y se da cuenta de las cosas, hablale dile que siempre le enviaste dinero y que ahora no lo has hecho por problemas económicos y que cuando tengas un nuevo empleo le seguiras enviando dinero para su manutención. Eso a parte de ayudarte también en el asunto legal (ya que eso no prescribe) es decir continua su marcha legalmente mientras tu hijo sea menor de edad. No creas tu que por que no te han molestado más eso se quedo así, pues no amigo, lamento decirte que legalmente y judicialmente eso sigue su marcha. Así que nuevamente te aconsejo te dirijas al Tribunal donde te presentabas y des tu información y así te cuidas tus espaldas. Y te aconsejo que busques a tu hijo ya que para luego será tarde y no te querra ver nunca más. Es tu hijo y nada ni nadie te quitara ese derecho.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, es raro que en un dos a?os tu divorcio no haya salido, pienso que ya es hora por que ha pasado mucho tiempo, también deberías ir por eso, buscar tu documento de divorsio y tenerlo contigo y si eso esta parado por culpa del abogado que es lo que puedo notar, habla en el tribunal que tiene el caso y pregunta que ha pasado con eso.<br>  <br>  Te deseo la mayor de las suertes y haz lo que te recomiendo. Nada vaz a perder si en realidad te portaste bien y diste su manutención mientras tenias empleo. Así que no tienes nada que esconder. Pero adelantate tu antes de que ella lo haga. Aunque no te puede hacer nada ya que estas desempleado y legalmente no se justifica que te puedan hacer nada, solo esperar que empieces a trabajar para que continues enviando la manutención que debes hacer por ley y por padre. Acuerdate que tu hijo no tiene la culpa del problema de divorcio. Eso es algo entre tu ex y tu. Y ante la ley ganarias puntos de honestidad si haces lo que te recomiendo. <br>  Y EN CUANTO A ESA QUE MENCIONA QUE TE VAN A PONER PRESO, NO es ASI, soy Experta en Derecho Civil y Garantías y nunca he visto eso,si el hombre se niega teniendo empleo a pasar manutención SE LE EMBARGA UNA PARTE DEL SUELDO PARA LA MANUTENCIóN DE LOS HIJOS Y NO SE PONE PRESO eso no está petificado en ningun código civil ni penal, pero en tu caso no es así. Por eso te recomiendo que te pongas a derecho con un tribunal el que lleva tu expediente y des tus motivos por los cuales no le pasas manutención a tu hijo. Apenas tienes 3 meses, no dejes pasar mas tiempo.|`|6bea3197ed81664341b9d99e7be79e22aa	SI NO TIENES EMPLEO PS KREO KE NO TE PASA NADA, PERO SI ES URGENTTE KE BUSKES UNO POR KE LAS KOSAS NO LAS DEJRA ASI KOMO ASI UN JUEZ|`|5N0zROVWaa	huy amigo, ps ya te tardaste, porque bien ella podria demandarte por falta de pension e ir a dar al bote o carcel... en cuanto te quedaste sin trabajo debiste de haber ido al juzgado donde llevaban el caso para dar aviso de que te quedaste sin trabajo y al mismo tiempo cerciorarte de que reralmente se retiro la demanda, ya que ahorita te tiene en la palma de su mano y si ella quisiera te aplastaba como a un ignorante gusano, suerte.... carpe diem.

Esto no es un asunto de belleza, y la fidelidad en general...tampoco lo es...La fidelidad tiene que ver con compromiso y con convencimiento. Obviamente tu te casaste con un hombre que fallo en su compromiso por algun motivo...y eso ocurre, no tienen nada de raro, despues de todo el alega que esta enamorado.

2THHtMZhaa	i had a friend who had this problem. she lives here in Virginia and her boyfriend lived in Germany... they talked online for almost a year, but after that, she started liking another guy and decided it was never going to last if they could never see each other. i know you probabally really like him.. but when its someone you really like.. dont you want to get to see them all the time?? i know its hard, but unless you live near one another, the relationship will not last and be successful. you won't be happy with it. TRUST ME. eventually you will find a guy that you like just as much that u will be able to see all the time. you will be happier with that. when you go to camp, just try to be close friends with him. hope that helped a little.

xc8bnpCvaa	You seriously need to report it to the police. For 2 reasons. 1 being that the stuff is illegal and wrong the 2nd being that if for some reason your computer is looked at it shows that you visited the site and you could be charged with a crime for viewing the sites. <br>  <br>  I had a friend whose brother in law, who was a sheriff's deputy went  to jail for this same thing. He opened an email with a link to a "funny video" but the link to ok him to a porn site and every time he tried to exit it opened a new window, he tried everything to get it to stop but it was like a virus that would not close etc... poor guy spent 6 months in jail, lost his job and had his reputation ruined! <br>  So I urge you to go to the police, hopefully you can give them the web address etc<br>  Good luck|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	the fastest way is through your local state or provincial police.|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	i would call the police. not mcafee.|`|YXTMk7H5aa	call the cops. tell them the links and then ask them if they really are approved.

ekEj2Mbiaa	He does love you, that's why he feels you deserve someone much more than him. Maybe he feels like he's not good enough for you.<br>  <br>  Tell him how much you love him, how he's the only guy you ever want, that you want to stay with him forever, and let him know he needs to stop saying that you can find someone better because it makes you upset since he's all you could ever ask for.|`|AA10986891	Next time he says, just holding him in your arms and tell him <I love you, I want to be with you, I want to spend the rest of with you> <br>  <br>  All this stress is making him feel like he could be more focus on beign a good husband and that is taking a toll on his self steem. If you do the above you reasure him that you want and will be with him and that is goign to build up his confidence again.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I'm sure you are right that he loves you a lot.  It might be stress with his family.  It could be other stresses.  I think he is having a crisis of confidence.  Maybe he thinks all the stress in his life will affect you too.<br>  <br>  I think he needs reassurance from you.  Tell him you don't want to hear that negative talk about him not being good enough.  Tell him it's getting you down.  I think that should stop it.|`|i7b1WiLNaa	Tell him we are married, we love each other.<br>  This thought of splitting has got to go.<br>  <br>  I don't know where it is coming from but it has really got to go.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	have you ever heard of passive abuse <br>  well your husband is doing just that to you<br>  he is havign stress and he wants to make sure that you have it as well <br>  what he fetl to understand that one a spouse is under stress the other is as well, <br>  my story my hus use to say that he was going to kill himself, well one day i hand a combination of all the left over pills we have around the house with a botle of rhum guess what it has been  3 years i never hear I going to kill myself again <br>  when your hus say he will call a lawyer tell him not to wait for tomorrow hand him the phone and expalin to him that you are tired of his game (yes he is playing a game) tell him that he is too much of a drama queen he needs to stop it<br>  Nothing you can do about his family getting on his nerves, if they bother him than it is his place to tell them off|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Your probably acting NEEDY for his attention and love. He's picking up omn this and using it to HIS advantage!!!!!!! I personally think he's a slime ball for doing this. BUT you shouldn't act like you can't live without him either. You may be sounding and acting insecure and needy with him. In which he is NOT enjoying. So learn not to be so needy. And if I were you ( I know you won't do this ) BUT if I were you, you should call him on his threat and see what he does. Tell him you'll make the call yourself to the lawyers office!!!!!!!! Your NEEDY and he's taking advantage of this!!!!!!!! Wake up and smell the coffee. love ( I mean TRUE love ) shouldn't feel this way. You don't go around threatening your wife or husband??????? this realtionship doesn't sound do good. Theres a lot of issues here!!!!!!!! Look into WHY your SO NEEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|UnpxpOKTaa	Put your foot down and tell him "Enough is enough!  You should have thought about that before you married me.  Too late now, and you are stuck with me" but be firm about it.  If that one doesn't work, start making it into a joke.  When he says "I'm not good enough for you", just turn and tell him "no, but you are good in bed, so I guess I'll keep you".  If he doesn't get the response he is fishing for, then he will stop.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Your husband seems to have an "abusive" side to him.   Mental abuse, that is.    He has you hanging by a thread, stressed out and worried. These abusers feed on insecured preys like yourself.   This is not love what this man has for you, its a need to control and cause pain.  Be very careful you do not throw your life away next to a jerk like that.   Sometimes mental cruelty is the worse kind.    Good luck|`|ZQE61wUZaa	Well you say he loves you so much then you say your afraid he doesn't love you?? You also say there are some age difference, let me guess your the young one right? Your immature and should really take your marriage seriously like a grown up does.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Try telling him that maybe you could find someone better if you had to, but that you hope you never have to. <br>  I have always found that threats of this kind are more about control that anything else.|`|YyVGXt83aa	My ex said that and she was seeing someone else so I guess she said it just to justify what she was doing.|`|FzFSzilmaa	he has low self-esteem and accepts he isn't really the best for you...|`|VwnLufUAaa	The way I see it, his constant threatening to divorce you is immature, manipulative, and emotionally abusive. Maybe he's taking out his stress about his family on you, which is totally unfair. <br>  <br>  If I was in your shoes, I would force him to make a choice: go or stay. And if he chooses to stay, I would not tolerate any more threats of divorce. I would tell him that the next time he says he's going to call his lawyer, I'm calling my own lawyer first.<br>  <br>  Life is too short to be led along like a puppy on a string. He may love you, but he has a terrible way of showing it. Don't let him do this to you anymore.
AA10151168	Instead of talking face to face,why do you guys prefer e-mail conversations or written notes?Talk to him. At least phone him and ask it.<br>  If he doesn't care don't pressure or try to learn. Just stay away for a while. Don't degrade yourself for someone who doesn't care.|`|Oi2L8BbLaa	I'm not really sure because I never had any experience with boys because...

MyjgtGotaa	You need to speak with her and reassure her, she may be experiencing mothers' anxiety and could be expecting the worst. She might be feeling you have something to hide from her that she wants to help you with. Going through your stuff is wrong but she may be loosing trust in you. Are you close with your mother? Here's something that you can try, it will probably bring you closer together, and she'll remember it for a long time. When the mood is right (when you both feel comfortable with each other) share an nice entry from your diary with her. This way you'll be sharing your secret thoughts with her, and it may calm her anxiety. It may sound like a cheesy mother-daughter moment in a chick flick, but in reality those are the best moments.|`|9ae919aecab255ec4dd5fb19b5c555e8aa	I had a diary cause I had no one to talk to  and thats sad you can't talk to your parents about what your doing cause you'll get in trouble.So my step mom read my diary and decided I was a liar and nothing in my diary was true she said, but it was all true stuff.And my Dad was mad cause I had a diary cause she read it and I got in trouble.So your mom will read it if she finds it and she will find it.There is no way around this  sorry.|`|htSZsds7aa	Let her know u will talk with her, but your private thoughts are yours and yours alone.Maybe keep the diary in your locker.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HONEY,,,THERES NOT MUCH U CAN SAY,,I BET HER MOM WAS THE SAME WAY WITH HER,,,DONT U HAVE A LOCKER AT SCHOOL,,OR IF U HAVE A COMPUTER,,,U CAN WRITE IN IT,,AND SAVE IT IN A FOLDER,,THAT ONLY U NO THE CODE TO,,,HONEY I WAS A MOMA,,,AND I NO ITS IMPORTANT FOR GIRLS TO HAVE DIARIES,,,AND ITS TABOO,,FOR US TO READ THEM,,,THATS YOUR PRIVACY,,,,,PEACE|`|djUMvICoaa	Ask her if you can make a compromise with her, you have nice little 10 minute chats with her and you get to keep your diary and private.  Tell her it will be your way of being to look back and remember things, and yes, they can include being mad at her.  Try to reassure her that if she's worried about sex or boys doing something they shouldn't, you'd talk to her about it right away, which if she has a good line of communication with you you will.  Tell her you love her but you would like your own space on this one little matter.  If you get to the library look up the 'covered wagon women' by  Kenneth Holmes, it's a complication  of diaries found that the women kept going across america in the late 1800's.  They are interesting but showing your mom how parts of our past as certain people see it would have been lost if not for diaries like these.  There are also some that are written by teens included.  They are bison books.  These people had people who they shared their thoughts with everyday, yet they found it necessary to write in these journals everyday, even when nothing was happening, just to report that.|`|eXTMwatMaa	tell your mom <br>  <br>  its a way to let out your thoughts<br>  <br>  and im sure some things you dont want to talk to your mom about it<br>  <br>  but remember moms is your bestfriend believe it or not but you don't have to tell her everything in your life because im sure you will have some things that are private.<br>  <br>  hide it somewhere else then your room.|`|4NI6QDDuaa	try finding a place in your room, like in your closet, or get a diary that has a lock, or get a fake diary and then hide your other one. <br>  hope i helped =)|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Just tell her that you will share your thoughts with her, most of them anyway, but that some  things are private and you want to be free to express yourself in that way. Maybe even tell her that it is a way for you to explore your creativity but that the important stuff you will talk to her about. I don't think she means to be overbearing but maybe just wants to be a part of your life and have you confide in her. <br>  They also make diaries that are protected by a verbal password that recognizes YOUR voice only. If she doesn't accept it, maybe you should keep the diary in the locker or find some other outlet for your thoughts. <br>  I try to let my kids have certain privacy's, like a diary, to me those things are off limits (but I DO check cell phones, myspace's etc) Unless you give your mother a reason not to trust you or a need to check up on you you should just talk to her openly about why you need the diary as an outlet. <br>  Remember when talking to your parent, the more mature, calm and respectful you speak the better your side of the issue will be taken. Try not to get upset and use an inappropriate tone<br>  Good luck!
YbwDFvEaaa	It sounds like your friend does have some sort of issue with you, whether it's the fact you're seeing her brother or not, and rather than simply talk to you about it she's trying to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible so that you're the one who pulls away...then when you stop talking to each other, she doesn't have to say she's the one who cut ties. <br>  <br>  You need to be direct with your friend. Ask her flat out why it is she has been so difficult with you. She will probably be a little defensive, but if she realizes that you've caught onto her game she is more likely to tell you what's really going on. If she refuses and just gives you more trouble, then just let her know that you were only concerned for her well-being and your friendship, and that when she's ready to talk to you as a friend you'll be there for her...but in the mean time, you need to pull away. It will be hard, but it's not fair that you put up with abuse when she believes you won't stand up for yourself, since you are seeing her brother.|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	wow this is tough as you're seeing her brother so you can't cut her off out of your life. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is tell her that if she isn't going to listen to your help and advice then not to come to you anymore. She sounds like she does whatever she wants anyway, so your help won't go anywhere. As much as she's getting herself into trouble, it's her own fault. Next time she complains, say 'look, I've tried to advise you before but you choose not to listen. I'm still your friend, but you have to help yourself.' <br>  <br>  She is very childish and obviously has very low confidence in herself if she's sleeping with another friend's boyfriend and isn't doing well at school and arranging things without you. I think it's best you're not around her much anyway, as she'll only try and drag you into her mess. <br>  <br>  Keep your distance but still be friendly. It's a difficult situation but you have to let her get it together by herself. She's old enough. Good luck and just live your own life.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Why don't you just be there for her instead of judging what she is doing.  Is she going through something at home?  Or maybe she feels like she can't come to you anymore because you are now her brother's girlfriend and not just her friend.<br>  <br>  Speak to her and don't just have a go at her, at the end of the day real friends support they don't judge.|`|bc70e3a16900c4dd03ebe4dc89b0161daa	Well  you need to have a 1 on 1 with this friend.  Start out with a very serious tone and let her know how much her friendship means to you.  Tell her that you only want the best for her and don't want to see her get into any trouble.  Let her see how true you want your friendship to be and how genuine you are.  I think this will go a long way for the two of you.<br>  Best of luck with this, and God Bless|`|IQEf57ANaa	WHHOA i think your friend has a problem and it doesnt have anything to do with you. i think she wants attention or she is angry at the world for some reason. try talking to a doctor or soemthing ( of course dont mention ehr name) but ask him why your friend will act like this, try taking to her after you get some advice. <br>  <br>   by doctor i mean a physicologiest.|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	Can you confront her about why she didn't invite you? I don't think you're childish to be upset at all, but rather she is for planning stuff behind your back instead of straight-up telling you she has a problem.<br>  <br>  You don't exactly have to drop her, but could you spend less time around her? Don't go out of your way to call her, don't try to hang out with her, and keep her at arm's length. You don't have to be mean to her, just not interested in what she says. Tell her you aren't going to help her with her work anymore if she's going to get upset and take her anger out on you, because that's not the place for that. Good luck.|`|kSIbucMjaa	aw its horrible when friends change, i know. but what shes doing is bad, and i realli hope she decides to change soon otherwise she'll just keep spiralling out of control.<br>  i dont know what you could do realli, maybe just tell her what shes doin is upsettin you and if she doesnt change shes gonna lose you.<br>  <br>  sorri i couldnt be more help, but i didnt know what to say??<br>  <br>  good luck...<br>  <br>  xxx|`|UPhngg5Waa	Grow up and<br>  Leave her alone.
AA10975867	Our church has the same design as it is round. Sighhhhh..obviously the architects of these buildings didn't consider weddings, funerals or even the procession each and every sunday for Mass. Sundays, our Priests alternate the aisle they use. Weddings are difficult. If the bride walks in and goes up towards the altar on the left side, people see her with her veil down (in some cases) and can take photos of her with her dad. Then, if she goes out with her groom all smiling and happy, it is another group that gets the best photos. At every wedding we see people frantically shoving across the pews to get a closer view even if they are not taking photos! As for the guests, generally the parents and siblings sit up front in the centre and the ushers just try to seat everyone else evenly around the rest of the pews. I did attend one wedding where the bridal party used the right aisle and instructed the ushers to seat everyone around that aisle only. they just ignored the left aisle as if it didn't exist and that worked out the BEST of all the weddings. Their pew bows/flowers were only on both sides of that aisle as well and the professional photographer treated their photos as if that was the centre aisle. Worked very well.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I almost went with a church with no center aisle.  I suggest that you have 'open seating', where the bride's guests and groom's guests sit wherever. If you have ushers, just have them seat people accordingly.  I'm not doing a 'bride's side' and 'groom's side' because my fiance's family is about 5000 times bigger than mine.  <br>  <br>  You can still come down the bride's side and after the ceremony, exit with the groom on the groom's side.|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	My church is set up the same way two aisles down the side with a huge seating section in the middle and on the other sides of the two aisles. I will walk up one aisle and down the other.<br>  <br>  Here's my plan. Important family is the front two or three rows, grooms and brides' family together. And then the ushers will seat everyone where they want. I'm not going to force the brides' side or grooms' side. It'll be too difficult to maneuver.|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	I got married in a church that was the same so I came in on the left side where all my family were seated and, once married left the church as his wife and therefore with his name, and went out the right side of the church where all of his family were seated.  All the best and have a great day.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	Walk up one aisle, down the other.  Put Family up front like normal.  It should go fine that way.|`|Pwybznsxaa	I've been to weddings like that before! It was kind of different b/c not everyone can the see the wedding ceremony as good as those who are sitting off the main aisle they're using. I'm sorry i don't have great advice, though!|`|mWIIjKUSaa	I am going through the same thing... I plan to walk up one side and down the other so everyone gets a chance to see me and my dress... The close family will set in the front and the rest can set where they please...|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	argh this is bugging me, a friend of mine got married in a church with no center aisle years ago but I can't remember who!  well so all the guests get a look at you, why don't you walk down one aisle to the altar, and up the other after the ceremony.

Oi2L8BbLaa	In my opinion... I think she's just jealous of any boy having an interest in you... That's what I can figure out from what she's doing.. I hope I help..|`|3y8YIs3raa	it sounds like jelousey just talk to her if she responds in a negative  and wont be ur friend or summin then she wasnt a good friend anyway hope i helped :]|`|AA10300394	Yeah I agree with the person who answered before me, it does sound like she's jealous. She wants ALL the attention. She already has a boyfriend, so she shouldn't be flirting with his friend (thats what I got from the situation, I could be wrong). Really, I'm not sure how I'd talk to her about it, but maybe steer the convo into a different direction- more about YOU and him instead of him & her. If you really want to talk to her about it, bring it up right when she does it. When she's saying how he was playing w/ her hair earlier, he winked at me- basically when she's bragging about something they've done together, I'd say something like "why do you do that?" and she'd obviously ask ''do what'' and then say what bothers you about what she does. My advice, don't do it in a negative, attacking way. Try to keep it as chill as you can, so she doesn't go on the offensive. Good luck! :)|`|bI2HlRahaa	My opinion is that she has always been the attention getter or kind of a hog for the lime-lite. She can't stand someone else getting the attention. Just approach her and ask her if she is interested in this guy. If she's not then tell her that you are interested in him and to back off a little.

Cuando sientes que tu corazón late más rapido de lo acostumbrado cuando lo ves. Cuando sientes que sin el no puedes estar, cuando sientes una conexión, amor, respeto, comprensión y amistad por esa persona que sientes que amas.<br>  <br>  Cuando pasa el tiempo y conoces a otros hombres y a pesar de que te traten de conquistar y sean bellos, tu no puedes aceptarlos porque siempre tienes presente a esa persona que desvela tus sue?os. En fin son muchos sentimientos encontrados que se sienten cuando amas de verdad a una persona.<br>  <br>  Es también cuando metes en tus proyectos a ese ser que amas, es decir, piensas en un futuro con estar al lado de él, cuando piensas como será si se llegan a casar o estar juntos.

OSj9XY2Caa	ética: es la forma en que cada persona interpreta las normas morales, es decir, es la forma en la que se cumple una norma que esta dispuesta por el mundo exterior, de tal forma que una persona es ética si cumple con las reglas o normas morales impuestas por la sociedad.<br>  entonces la ética en la relaciones familiares es el cumplimiento de dichas normas morales, que están determinadas por la cultura.<br>  A modo de ejemplo, el respeto a los padres es una norma moral, porque la influencia de generaciones pasadas nos han ense?ado que les debemos el más alto respeto a nuestros progenitores. El cumplimiento de esta norma tiene un efecto feed back, puesto que al respetarlos, ellos nos respetan.. por ende esto promueve una familia unida donde reinan la paz y la decencia. Cuando esto se cumple en este nivel, da a luz una sociedad fuerte y bien cimentada!<br>  Dicho lo anterior concluimos que la ética es simplemente cumplir con las normas morales que nos imponen.. y el cumplimiento de estas es estimulante y beneficioso para todos.<br>  saludos!!|`|0p1g9cudaa	precisamente en la familia es donde se aprenden los valores morales. de nada te sirve un curso universitario sobre etica, si no aprendiste en tu casa. <br>  <br>  Saludos <br>  <br>  Marian.|`|AA12004129	la verdad tiene que haber mucha honestidad y comfianza aceptacion y comprencion|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	La unión, el respeto mutuo entre todos los miembros de la familia, la comunicación y sobre todo la educación es sumamente importante en todo grupo familiar.<br>  <br>  No hay como la educación de familia, es la base de todo.|`|b83365197f9999139e8e424ab068b97aaa	exactamente lo mismo que en relaciones publicas solo que , nesesita se runa familia de buena educacion para entenderlo asi de otro modo no hay ninguna regla a seguir asi que cual etica?

Entiendo que todos son mayores de edad y tu no puedes responder por las decisiones que estos chicos toman.<br>  Tampoco los puedes someter a una autoridad que no quieren aceptar. Creo que cada ser humano es víctima de sus propias decisiones y ellas, se me antoja eligieron lo que creyeron era lo mejor para ellos.<br>  Esta nueva generación que se está levantando (nuestros hijos) son supremamente edonistas, egoistas, de pensamiento filosófico cínico y escéptico, pues no se uieren sujetar y tampoco respetan ni a sus padres ni a los mayores, ni a la sociedad ni a nadie.<br>  Creo que tu corazón descansa porque has hecho lo que tenías que hacer, y aportaste lo que podías y creías que era importante aportar.<br>  He conocido varios casos en donde aquellos muchahos que fueron adoptados grandesitos, se han convertido en verdadero dolor de cabeza para sus padres adoptivos.<br>  Supongo que con la autoridad que te caracteriza, ha de impedir que sigan tratornando tu hogar.<br>  Si ellos no se someten a las reglas de la casa, han de hacer su propia vida lejos de ustedes. <br>  Conocí el caso de un hombre creyente, que con el dolor de su alma, retó a su hija, quien mantenía relaciones con el novio; ella insistía en mantenerse promiscua, pero éste buen hombre estableció autoridad y la ni?a decidió irse de la casa. Si bien es cierto éste hombre ha sufrido por su hija; también ha sentido paz en su corazón porque la decisión la tomó ella y no él.<br>  Que Dios te ilumine y te guíe a hacer lo correcto, para que tu te sientas bien. <br>  De todas maneras las decisiones que se tomen son tuyas y no has de dejarte influenciar por experiencias ajenas y menos por opiniones ajenas.<br>  Un Abrazo muy grande para ti y

tiene un lugar donde ir, si no tiene trabajo, si esta mal emocionalmente, animicamente, entonces, creo que tu obligacion, mas alla de la edad que tus hijas tengan, tu hija en este caso es estar con

Ahora bien si ella tiene problemas de conducta, eso se lo tienes que recalcar, que si le aceptas volver es bajo tus reglas o si no que se quede afuera.|`|7Zdz95CMaa	No creo que sea cuestión de edad sino de deseo y de estar preparados para eso.En mi caso particular nunca pude vivir solo.Deben tener un motivo muy fuerte para no querer que vuelva.Si vuelve estimo que tendría que ser respetando las reglas de la casa.Esa chica debe tener muchos problemas,creo que esta pidiendo ayuda y deberían brindarsela y si necesitan asesorarse con un profesional e incluso tomar terapia ustedes o ella misma haganlo sin ningún pudor y lleguen a una solución buena para todos.Ustedes saben donde le apretan los zapatos.Aparentemente su hija les esta dando una excelente oportunidad para que la ayuden.Espero que encuentren una solución buena para todos.Obviamente estoy opinando desde afuera.Muchisima suerte con tu hija y que todo sea para bien.|`|5c396124ba522456f3503812aa31cf0baa	ok, para que estamos los padres, para ayudar a los hijos, es la ley de la vida, si a una de tus hijas le fue mal hay que ayudarle a que se vuelva a levantar, claro con restricciones, no como estaban antes, ensenales a respetar y que no estan dispuestos a tolerar nada, si quiere estar ahi necesita modificar su caracter y si no esta dispuesta ni modo madre hay que ponerse duros ya que es por el bien de la chica recuerda que los hijos son el reflejo de los padres, te deseo mucha suerte y mucha fortaleza|`|cbb3a74c9e07826c951da32c8fe21ccfaa	la edad que se sientan responsables entre 18 a?os a 23 eso pienso yo|`|nTuXVvUdaa	Yo pienso que no hay edad para eso, uno se independiza cuando debe hacerlo, no hay más..........pero también pienso que es bueno como madre que los dejes ir, para que valoren lo que es su familia|`|rBPVTcrgaa	Creo que los limites los marcan los padres, si ella quiere volver y es justamente la mas conflictiva es porque evidentemente todavía no ha madurado lo suficiente como para hacerse cargo de sus cosas. Es muy difícil de cambiar las cosas de un día para otro, tanto en los padres como en los hijos, pero creo que haciéndole sentir que en su hogar puede sentirse refugiada y acompa?ada de sus familia seria un gran paso para poder entablar una relacion mas armoniosa.

Q9Y23mtXaa	pues yo digo que no esta mal siempre y cuando se respete la relacion en pareja que se tenga y pues mientras haya repeto y confianza mutua pues no habra problema por ninguna de las dos partes pero esto es mal visto aveces por mucha gente ya que piensan cosas que no son y eso se debe a la educacion que hayamos tenido con el paso del tiempo y que seamos de mente abierta bueno bye|`|0e345e1e2813a48c752dc95219657fb0aa	Yo pienso que si querías sa?ir con amigos no debías haberte casado.<br>  <br>  No existe una norma, pero creo que es algo que debieron hablar antes de casarse no ya casados. El matrimonio es un contrato y en ese contrato existen claúsulas, las cuales significan un derecho y una obligación.<br>  <br>  Si a tu pareja no le parece bien que tu salgas con amigos, se supone que lo debes aceptar de buena gana. En otro caso tu estás incumpliendo con el contrato de repsetar la voluntad de ambos y que las decisiones se tomen en consenso.<br>  <br>  Por lo que veo ya te hartó el matrimonio y no se cuanto tiempolleves de casada pero estás en el momento en que debes poner un alto y replanetear las cluausulas.<br>  <br>  Es decir, si no estás de acuerdo, es conveniente que se digano Adios, por el bien de los dos.<br>  <br>  Pero no tiens por que sentirte atada. Por eso la ley da esa libertad de disolver el matrimonio. No es una condena, es un acto de voluntad.|`|ECF1JKRtaa	no lo creo|`|JA71Nuz4aa	mmm creeo q ya etas casado  pero puedes divertirte sanamente|`|UZNksQKraa	eso yo creo que es incorrecto. esta bien salir con los amigos aun cuando esta uno casado.|`|ed56ee40ff6a2e059c5131d4d244601baa	La mayoría de lo que leo aquí me parecen barrabasadas. Cuando te casas, definitivamente no es para estar en TODO momento con tu pareja. Eso es una estupidez.<br>  Cada quien debe tener su espacio y debe ser respetado a por sobre todas las cosas.<br>  En lo que sí estoy de acuerdo, es en que hay que ver con quien sales, es decir, si sales con alguien que pretende algo más contigo o con un exnovio(a), en lo personal no creo que esté bien. Fuera de eso, pienso que cada quien puede perfectamente tener sus amistades y eso lo DEBE entender tu pareja.|`|pW4EaSTMaa	Si puedes salir de vez en cuando y depende a donde y cuales "amigos",,porque el chiste de casarse es porque querías estar con tu pareja en todo momento no?..sino mejor te hubieras quedado soltera y saliendo con tus amigos sin ningún problema...|`|zqbqEkhdaa	depende, si salis a divertirte me parece que no esta mal. Pero si estas buscando algo mas???|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	No estoy casada, pero pienso que toda pareja necesita su espacio, tanto ella como tu o si no se van ha ABURRIR muy pronto.<br>  <br>  Siempre y cuando le seas fiel en esas salidas, claro que debes salir con tus amigos a distraerte de ves en cuando, pero no seguido y ella también tiene derecho de compartir de vez en cuando con sus amigas. Eso le ayuda en su relación.<br>  <br>  Mi hermano casado hace eso y su esposa también y llevan a?os de casados y se respetan. Claro, sin llegar a las 3 de la madrugada jejee es una rato nada más y tratar de ser respetuoso NO MONTáNDOLE LOS CUERNOS CON ALGUNA QUE SE TE REGALE jjee <br>  <br>  bye y date tu tiempo y ella que se lo de también...Dile que lea esta respuesta que te di para que entienda y que deje los celos que eso se llama inseguridad. Que tenga los ojos bien abiertos, pero que no sea tan insegura. Ya que el hombre por naturaleza si desea poner los cuernos en cualquier lugar lo puede hacer, en el trabajo, saliendo a comprar pan, etc. Así que respetence su tiempo los dos para que la relación fluya mejor.<br>  <br>  Creo que con confianza, respeto, comunicación y tolerancia todas las parejas pueden durar mucho tiempo.<br>  <br>  Bye espero que cuando me case sea así.<br>  <br>  Te envio una estrellita.|`|de6829ec7bb788891d006ae86540ac28aa	Porque los amigos de cuando estabamos solteras pueden visitarnos en nuestras casas o si trabajan cerca de donde trabajamos podemos ir a busc arlos o ellos a nuestro trabajo si antes lo haciamos no es convenieate otras salidas entre solteros y casados porque unos y otros ya tienen otros gustos y persiguen distintas cosas, al menos yo no lo hacia y mi marido tampoco salvo que vayan los hombres a una cancha a jugar a la pelota o las mujeres a otros juegos|`|19ad801b2436522ceaabbd079d33f0b5aa	Si quieres salir con tus amigos pa que diablos te casas?????Claro todo el mundo quiere estar con Dios y con el diablo,quieres estar con tu marido y a la misma vez coquetearle a tus amigos,que infame.Si fueras mi esposa te mando al infierno.|`|5POhDeuQaa	Yo pienso que no teienes porque perderte esas salidas con los amigos despues d etodo estas casado/a no vendido como esclavo/a ademas es sano para la relacion que tengas un respiro y que sigas socializando eso si siempre guardando respeto a tu pareja, recuerda a mayor libertad mayor responsabilidad, <br>  Saluditos!!!!!!!!|`|714a6b7c731adac373f55fd70311cf12aa	Esta bien que cada uno salga con sus respectivas amistades.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	So went through this with the girl I dated before I met my wife.  We were best friends, dated, broke up, dated, broke up - stayed friends on and on ad nauseum.<br>  <br>  The tension we had got to be so strong that we finally had to stop seeing each other altogether or we were not going to be able to stay friends.<br>  <br>  I still consider her a great friend and I believe she feels the same about me.  What saved us was the open and honest recognition that for us we could not go backwards in our relationship and just be friends the way we were before.<br>  <br>  This is why love is a risk - but I don't regret it.<br>  <br>  Besides - now I am married to my best girl and the other girl has a great life as well.  Time does heal all wounds if you will allow it breathing room.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No you shouldn't be friends with someone you still have feelings for.

But you may have to accept the fact that her wanting to be just friends may be permanent and nothing you say or do will win her back.

No es que estes enfermo, pero debes buscar ayuda profesional, es decir con un terapeuta o siquiatra, quien te ayudará a sacar de ese estado de animo en el que te encuentras.<br>  <br>  Sabes a mi me paso lo mismo, siempre sola, no queria salir, sino dormir, me aislaba, etc y fui al médico y me ayudo mucho. Me mando a caminar una hora todos los días, a tomar aire fresco, a inscribirme en un gimnacio, a estudiar lo que me gustara mas es decir un curso, de pintura, musica, etc. También recomiendan nadar todos los días, escuchar música, tratar poco a poco de relacionarte con personas y sobre todo NO ESTAR SOLO ya que te pones  a pensar en cosas malas y eso te baja a autoestima.<br>  <br>  Asi amiguito que a ponerte esas pilas y a salir de ese estado de depresión que tienes, ya que si la dejas pasar por más tiempo se te puede convertir en algo peor y ahí si estarías enfermo. Deja la flojera, sal, diviertete y si lo deseas empieza a salir solo, ve a un cine, camina por un parque, ve a un museo, etc y tal vez conozcas a la chica de tus sue?os.<br>  <br>  También debes empezar por hacerte un corte de cabello diferente, cambiar tu forma de vestir, etc. así empiezas a darte animos y cambias por fuera y también por dentro.<br>  <br>  Acuerdate que la vida es bella solo tenemos que saber es VIVIRLA y no dejar de perderla en estar solos, aburridos y tristes.<br>  <br>  También podrías hablar con tus padres y contarles lo que te ocurre para que te ayuden. <br>  <br>  TQM.

bf3ikOv8aa	i think she is tired of you using her. you obviously cant settle for one girl at a time, so forget about seeing the girl on the side. she wants to be the only one in someones life. she wants to feel special and loved and you obviously cant be monogamous, so my advice, stick with the girl that obviously oblivious to you cheating and find someone new. let the good one go. she deserves better than you.|`|0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Yeah she thinks you're going to leave your GF for her because THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD HER YOU IDIOT...  you said that in your question and I quote "I've told her that I was going to leave my gf soon and move in with a friend."

Her or your other girl. you can't have your cake and eat it to.|`|P5CmZz40aa	you might think its all cool right now to have a g/f and a girl on the side buts it not one day the girl on the side will get fed up and next thing you know u got played and g/f will also leave ya so pick one and stay put or in the end u will get hurt
T7g29J6yaa	mayte, se complica porque la pareja perfecta no existe, yo estuve buscando a la supuesta, mas de 15 anos, y una persona sabia me dijo, no lo vas a encontrar, nada es completo, y la felicidad total no existe, segui su consejo y trate de conocer primero y luego, decidir, ahora te cuento que mi esposo, y yo nos conocimos inesperadamenre, no es completo, pero ya sabes, yo tambien he puesto de mi parte, dicen que la mujer hace al hombre, y si despues que te casas vives desarreglada, es tu problema, no debes dejarte caer, no hay nada seguro en esta vida, todo va y viene, los hombres son como son, ahora hay un libro por ahi que dice que las mujeres somos mas malas, no estoy de acuerdo, pero ellos piensan a veces mal de nosotras.<br>  mira puedes acabar, con todos los que quieras, (sexo), pero a la hora de salir, a la calle o con alguien nuevo muy decente, porque nunca se sabe si sera ese tu alma gemela o el que estara contigo por un tiempo, hazme caso y no desesperes, vive y disfruta y luego casate y ten hijos pero con el que tu quieras, y sin buscar creeme llegara, suerte|`|jNG7g42waa	No creo q sea cierto completamente.. a mi parecer eso depende más bien de la forma de ser de cada uno y la forma de relacionarse.. pues si no se les comunican todos nuestros sentimientos, inquietudes y/u otras emociones no se puede tener confianza.. y una relación sin confianza no tiene bases y fracasa.. es cierto que a veces.. muchas veces la verdad, nos complicamos sin necesidad! Hacemos de peque?as cosas grandes alborotos.. esto efectivamente forma parte de nuestra naturaleza.. y para poder concretar algo en la vida tenemos que aceptar que no somos perfectos! pues debemos aceptarnos y querernos tal cual somos.. y si no nos gusta.. hacer cambios para nuestro beneficio.<br>  <br>  Pienso... que muchas veces se nos hace difícil encontrar a la persona "perfecta" porque nos esmeramos en buscar TODAS las cualidades que nos hacen falta.. y en cuanto conocemos a alguien.. y alguna d sus cualidades falla, lo descartamos completamente! y no debe ser así.. nadie es perfecto, lo cual es bien sabido.. pero también se tienen muchas cualidades buenas que suplen a las carentes.. y con el tiempo, con los tropiezos.. se llega a entender esto.. y al final, una de lasprincipales cualidades que debemos bucar.. es que nuestra pareja, sea nuestro mejor amigo, que nos entienda, nos conozca y nos quiera tal cual somos. Jejeje.. incluyendo nuestra naturaleza!|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Pienso que es porque hoy en día los hombres tienen mucha facilidad de encontrar más mujeres en la calle que antes, bueno así dice mi madre y hoy en día existe el facilismo para ellos y eso nos hace más difícil encontrar a uno bueno jejej están como los teléfonos públicos, todos da?ados y los que sirven están ocupados.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a lo otro de tu pregunta entraría ya en la mujer cuando esta casada, pero creo que en algunas es que se ve eso, que se descuida, se ponen gordas, no cuidan su apariencia y no tratan de ser la buena amante que eran al principio de la relación  y por eso ellos se buscan a otra en la calle. <br>  <br>  Pienso que hoy en día tenemos mucha competencia nosotras las mujeres, no se, creo que hay más mujeres que hombres y hoy con tantas crujías, modas, etc hay mujeres lindas en todas partes, por eso debemos de ser mas astutas y tratar de vernos mejor por fuera y por dentro, prepararnos, ser coquetas, sensuales, no ser peleonas, tratarlos con cari?os, etc. para que se queden a nuestro lado y no anden buscando a nadie más.<br>  <br>  Bueno saluditos y te respondí con lo pies en la tierra jeje|`|ca82af4e2a219eb8a407ac58aa534fa8aa	Mira la pareja perfecta no existe es lo primero que te digo, si estas esperando por alguien perfecto te quedaras solterona. Otra si los hombres son esto o aquello, para eso existe el noviazgo y lo puedes conocer. También las mujeres cuando ya están casadas se descuidan eso es cierto y al ver mujeres en la calle mas arregladas que la esposa eso los tienta y se buscan otra. También tenemos mucha culpa no solo los hombres.|`|615ce86cafe7bfe8292ee01f65099355aa	Yo opino que en parte es porque tenemos espectativas demasiado altas (estamos buscando ese príncipe azul irreal).  Por otro lado, si nos metemos con cualquier _i di ota_, entonces es porque tenemos la autoestima baja.|`|NGri1VRzaa	uuhhhyyy si , me parece super dificil encontrar al hombre perfecto pero yo creo que es porque yo soy muy exigente en eso de buscar a mi pareja o porque soy demaciado dulce para ciertos hombres y por eso les paresco muy infantil , pero yo no les pongo cuidado y sigo en mi busqueda .<br>  por otra parte , nos es dificil encontrar al hombre ideal ya que son lo suficientemente mujeriegos y de un caracter machista y arrogante o tambien porque nosotras nos encargamos de hacerles la vida imposible despues del matrimonio , nuestras cosas o temas de chicas causan problemas en relaciones de pareja porque a ellos les fastidian estos temas, pero solo tengo que decirte una cosa . <br>  ??? Arriba las mujeres y abajo los hombres!!!<br>  sencillamente no me voy a dejar de esos hombres que no nos dejan seguir so?ando con nuestro verdadero amor . <br>  gracias por preguntar Mayte|`|OVDZxAA9aa	Yo creo que todas las relaciones son de dos, los hombres son difíciles pero nosotras también cooperamos. Y sobre todo, creo que eso de la pareja "perfecta" es un gran mito, nadie es perfecto, asi que tenemos que elegir lo mejor para nosotras pero tomando en cuenta que asi como nosotras, nuestra pareja también tendra defectos, y también nuestra relación, sólo hay que trajar por que sean los menos.|`|xe1OFI4jaa	Para empezar, por que tenemos que buscar a alguien. Tener pareja es bonito pero no debe de ser una necesidad de vida o muerte, generalmente buscamos en el otro lo que nosotros no tenemos. El verdadero amor comienza por uno, después de eso se puede decir que se tiene la capacidad de amar sinceramente y por consecuencia la pareja idónea llegara sin necesidad de ir de cacería.
fmIDB4ZFaa	Her first mistake was getting involved with a married man. <br>  <br>  Yes, she was probably the rebound.<br>  <br>  She needs to stop beating herself up.  She made some very admirable boundaries.  He did not want to do them.  I think she is so much better off with out this jerk.<br>  <br>  Seriously, she needs to just chalk this up to experience, learn from her own mistakes, forget about him and move on.<br>  <br>  p.s.

Go along with him and it should pass. It's great you can laugh about it and there is no harm in humoring him. Even let him know that Ben10 is a fine nickname! Leave his legal name alone. Ask him if you should change your name as well. Enjoy the imagination and make a game of it. Things change and this phase will run it's course.|`|UpRdvpmXaa	Nah, just help him draw his new birth certificate that calls him Ben 10. Its kinda funny...like when my 2 yo niece said, "I not Miranda (Manda)...I Baby" when her baby brother came home from the hospital...that lasted a month. She wouldn't respond to Miranda until we kept on telling her she couldn't use the big kid swing. They'll change it when they get tired of it.|`|707gOCvbaa	That is too fricking cute. Print out a fake certificate on line and tell him you changed his name.

Just let him be whoever he wants to be for now! It's ok, as he gets older he will forget about Ben 10!!!

When she found out about me she started writing him messages like - she looks like me, hugs, kisses and lots of love etc... He tried to tell me that she is just a friend (and yes she was friend his friend for him, but she wanted something more from him!)

He was hubby's best friend. We all cared about each other. This relationship was 13 years prior to reconnecting though so my husband and I are far more deeply bonded and a little less jealous. He is stationed overseas so he and I do not have access to one another. Sometimes the conversation is sexual, at my instigation but it is never serious and my husband is aware. There can be a little jealousy (things come up in life in general) but we mature and secure enough to not let that get in the way of talking to someone we both had a lot of fun with way back when! Anyway, if it werent for this other guy--my husband and I would not have what we have today!<br>  So, yes--you can have friendship with an ex even when jealousy may exist. Remember, I moved from one guy to another here! but the past is the past--yes, I still care about what happens in ex's life but not at all like I do with my husband and my husband knows that. My ex knows that too believe it or not. I enjoy the friendship we have now formed, he was and still is a great guy---just like my husband. I am proud of myself that I chose so well, even when I was young!<br>  My husband and he talk regularly as well and it's such a great thing that we can all get along in spite of the transition we made.|`|UMYda9Jaaa	When my husband and I went through the prerequisite counseling before we were married, our pastor told us to cut off all ties to previous relationships and to get rid of anything that we had from those relationships (gifts, photos, letters, etc.). We both agreed that that was a healthy and right decision to make.<br>  <br>  Neither of us is the jealous type, but we both wanted to make our commitment to each other solid and clear. We didn't ever want the temptation to fall back into an old relationship if it should ever happen that our marriage would go through a difficult time. Our marriage has to come first always.<br>  <br>  You say that you're craving a friendship with this other person and that "there will always be feelings for each other." That sounds awfully dangerous.  If you still have feelings for him and crave his presence, then you're not just friends. It sounds like your husband has a good reason to be jealous and even if he doesn't, you need to respect his feelings and get rid of this friendship. If you are truly committed to your husband, this old relationship is not worth ruining your marriage over.|`|hL9V86Nlaa	I think that you are in denial, because that person still have your heart. The spouse is not jealousy, she is worried, that she is about to lose out.  Wouldn't you be if the shoes was on the other foot.  It is possible to have a relationship with you ex- but listen to your own words. You "craved to have a friendship" and "Yes, there will always been feeling for each other".  You are hoping that you can rekindle the relationship, because of failure in the past.  I would say you are going to have to make a decision because somebody is going to get hurt in the end.  Remember this and hopefully this will help you "If a person has your heart, than they have a part of your life, because we always follow our heart".  Good luck|`|vRodocjcaa	NO! friendship is out of the question. something else has been there, and the more you are in contact with that person, the more the past will be brought back up time and again. and if there is ANY jealousy issues, as there will be, you MUST defer to your husband, you married HIM, not the ex, so the husband gets your primary attention. cut off contact with the ex before your husband is ex number 2|`|yNFsEPVBaa	I used to be very jealous when I was younger. I didn't even allow my wife to answer calls, however with the years I have learned that in her heart there is room for the persons she once loved and it wouldn't be smart not taking advantage of it. Nowadays when she is 41 she is really enjoying a nice relationship with a guy she dated for three years in college. He is also married and we have made friends with them as a couple. However sometimes they just need to go out and spend some time together. He understand her very well and gives her good counseling and support.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Once an ex has a commitment with someone else you must back off and respect.   If you want a friend, go on MySpace or Singles Site or even better yet, get a pet.   But please keep yourself out of this guy's life, he has no feelings for you or he would not have married someone else, speak for yourself.   Yes, you are in denial.   Slap yourself in the face, wipe your tears, raise your head up high and move on with your life.  Good luck|`|AA11659117	First off if there is a jealousy issue then you need to get all involved to sit down and talk. This way all can get to know each other and go from there. I dont think its a question of should there be a friendship, sounds more like not knowing about the jealous one.|`|AP2e90cCaa	I think it's okay to continue a friendship with an ex-lover as long as the parties involved agree that all three can be friends, not just the two.|`|FzFSzilmaa	i find nothing wrong with my partner being friends with anyone she wants to... i'm not her keeper... she is her own person and has the right to be friends with anyone she chooses...<br>  <br>  i am not the jealous type...|`|ZQE61wUZaa	No, unless they had children together|`|vtq12hVTaa	there are no adult relationships without sex...meet me in mildred's playpen|`|o9yv4puiaa	I would say NO and tell him how it makes you feel,|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	not a good idea|`|JtYNXoRdaa	As long as everyone is on the same playing field, I see no problem with it.  However, it sounds like the spouse in this story is NOT on the same playing field (I don't know if it's yours or his).  But if that is the case, then you have to ask yourself if the past relationship/friendship is worth screwing with the current one.  <br>  <br>  It's hard to put a real answer to because it's subjective.  My best friend in the world is an ex.  He has a pregnant fiancee and I have a boyfriend.  Both of our S/O's understand that we were friends long before either of them showed up and luckily, neither are the jealous type anyway.  I am not the jealous type and I'm also not the type to tell someone who they can and can't hang out with, unless I have a legitimate reason for doing so...and in my mind "You used to date them." isn't legit enough.<br>  <br>  With all that said though, if you were my spouse and were saying things like "Yes maybe there will always be feelings for each other" then I wouldn't be okay with you two hanging out alone.  That's just playing with fire.
rHwHAItGaa	Look, everyone compares their new love interests to their exes.  It's normal. The whole purpose of dating people is to find someone you wouldn't mind spending the rest of your life with, and there are bound to be some people you meet that you wouldn't mind spending a couple of months, years, whatever, with but certainly not the rest of your life.  You are suppose to look at everyone you've dated and take away something from it ... looking at the things you liked or disliked about that person generally.  <br>  <br>  For example, say you've never dated a smoker and you just broke up with a girl who smoke, but you didn't like that. Then you'd take that with you as a comparison for the next relationship. Or if she nagged at you for watching certain tv shows, or even good things like she may have taken good care of herself and was physically fit and you want another girl who does the same. <br>  <br>  Now, if you're obsessing over all the little things you MISS about your ex and not finding them in a new person then NO you're NOT over her.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	Just because you compare doesn't mean you're not over <br>  <br>  the person. Maybe you just like to determine whether you<br>  <br>  are making an improvent over your ex.|`|Pxh93GHcaa	Actually speaking this quite common thing. We do compare today with our past. This is for good only this makes sure that we don’t get the same set of people with whom we had the terrible time before.|`|nd4hUE36aa	I think it is kind of normal. But really think about it, are you really over her?|`|g2QUNwZzaa	umm, no. 100% absolutely not. if u were over her, u'd want nothing to do with her, and definitely not any other girl to be like her....<br>  i never went out with anyone for 4 years and it took me way longer than a month to get over them....|`|421288574b7a52a5ba8268e608253dfbaa	It's normal to do that and it is a sign that you're not completely over her. In time though, you will be able to take your ex off that pedestal and come to realize that every woman is different.|`|AfnOU04paa	No, you're probably not over her.  You're still thinking of all her wonderful attributes and want other ladies to have the same, and many will.  However, you guys broke up for a reason, and perhaps some of her not-so-great attributes lead to this.  Try to figure out what sort of personality you want in a girl, and which things you can live with, and which things you can't deal with.  Then compare other women you date to your own (and new) standard.|`|AA11359741	You should never do this!  Everyone is different in their own unique way, if everyone was the same, the world would be one boring place!<br>  <br>  Think about it this way...you and your ex broke up for a reason...and they are your ex for that reason.  If you look for someone like your ex then they might be the same.  You need to look for someone different, because it clearly didn't work with your ex so why look for someone like your ex?<br>  <br>  If i were you i wouldn't start dating for a while.  4 years is a long time and you'll need longer than a month to get over that.  Go out and find yourself, enjoy yourself and then you may meet someone when you're not looking who is the complete opposite to your ex but you get on really well! Hey, you might even forget about the ex!<br>  <br>  Take Care.|`|FgSTHArKaa	aaack<br>  i dont think you are over he r<br>  4 years?? come on<br>  thats a good chunk of time<br>  or she meant alot to you and you subconsciously know you had the best thats why you keep comparing|`|POZvhqj4aa	worse that's why they were the exes
6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Que no saben lo que quieren y con ser superficiales e infieles, con ellos mismos también lo están haciendo. SER INFIELES A SUS SENTIMIENTOS. <br>  <br>  Es triste, pero existen muchas personas así, que solo juegan con los sentimientos de las demás y eso no debería de existir. Si no quieres ya a una persona, dejala y buscate a otra, pero tener a dos al mismo tiempo es NO QUERER A NINGUNA. <br>  <br>  El amor de pareja no es compartido, o se quiere o no se quiere. Pero decir que se aman a dos por igual NO LO CREO. <br>  <br>  Tal vez con una tenga una conexión diferente a la otra, pero no es amor, solo feeling, deseos, etc. <br>  <br>  EL AMOR ES DE DOS, NO ES DE TRES.<br>  <br>  Y eso de estar CONFUNDIDOS no lo creo tampoco, en los sentimientos uno no se confunde O SIENTES o NO SIENTES. o AMAS o no AMAS....así de simple.<br>  <br>  Pero existen personas acostumbradas hacer  INFIELES POR NATURALEZA y eso muere con ellas. Siempre serán infieles en su vida, aunque tengan a su lado a la persona que más los aman y respetan....pero así es la vida amigo...y nada se puede hacer con ellos. SON ASí Y ASí MORIRáN.

Por ejemplo, el buscar ávidamente recompensas en la vida, dinero, prestigio, sexo, poder y cuando los conseguimos sentimos que no llenan ese vacío.<br>  <br>  Pero eso es algo muy profundo, otras veces, nuestro organismo se recarga y utiliza toda la energía para alinear nuestro sistema, lo que nos provoca estados de hastio.<br>  <br>  Y quizá también sea producto de una depresión o una ruptura emocional que no has diferido por completo.<br>  <br>  Sea la causa o causas que sean no te las puedes achacar por que te vas a sentir peor.

En la vida hay ocasiones en las que es natural sentirse así, sea uno casado o soltero, hombre o mujer, joven o mayor. Pero también hay que reconocer que los sentimientos de soledad no?surgen necesariamente por el hecho de estar solo. El erudito absorto en su labor de investigación podrá estar solo, pero no?se sentirá solo. El pintor que crea una obra de arte, aunque esté a solas, no?tiene oportunidad de sentirse solo. Estas personas agradecen un momento de aislamiento, y es entonces cuando la soledad se convierte en su mejor amiga.<br>  <br>  Los sentimientos de auténtica soledad se originan en nuestro interior, no?proceden de fuentes externas. Pueden ser provocados por alguna experiencia entristecedora: la muerte, el divorcio, el desempleo o alguna tragedia. Cuando iluminamos bien nuestro ser interior, podemos disminuir los sentimientos de soledad, quizás hasta disipándolos con el tiempo, y así podemos aceptar, asimilar, la pérdida que nos afligía.<br>  <br>  De los pensamientos emanan sentimientos. Tras superar una pérdida y lograr que los sentimientos que esta provocó queden relegados a un segundo plano, es tiempo de dar importancia a pensamientos edificantes, que nos ayudarán a seguir llevando una vida activa.<br>  <br>  Muévase. Domínese. Hay cosas positivas que hacer. Sea sociable. Telefonee a alguien. Escriba alguna carta. Lea un libro. Invite a algunos conocidos a su casa. Intercambie ideas con otras personas. Si quiere tener amigos, sea amigable. Trate de conocerse bien para poder llegar a otros. Sea bondadoso con los que le rodean. Comente noticias espirituales edificantes. Si lo hace, comprobará que Jesús tenía razón cuando dijo: “Hay más felicidad en dar que en recibir”. También comprobará la veracidad de otro proverbio: “El que liberalmente riega a otros, él mismo también será liberalmente regado”. (Hechos 20:35; Proverbios 11:25.)<br>  <br>  De usted depende<br>  <br>  ?Le parece difícil? ?Cree que es más fácil decirlo que hacerlo? Todo lo que merece la pena cuesta menos de dicho que de hecho. De ahí que hacerlo produzca satisfacción. Se requiere mucho esfuerzo de su parte. Al dar de sí mismo, su radiante luz interior se hace aún más brillante. Es usted quien tiene que procurar vencer la soledad que trata de dominarle. Un escritor dijo lo siguiente en la revista Modern Maturity: “Ninguna otra persona es responsable de su soledad, pero usted puede hacer algo al respecto. Con tan solo una amistad puede dar una nueva dimensión a su vida. Puede perdonar a alguien con quien esté dolido. Escribir una carta a alguna persona. Llamar a alguien por teléfono. Solo usted puede dar un giro a su vida. No?hay ningún otro ser humano que pueda hacerlo por usted”. Ese mismo escritor citó de una carta que había recibido y dijo que “dio exactamente en el clavo: ‘A todos les digo que está en sus manos librarse de la soledad e insatisfacción. ?Querer es poder!’”.<br>  <br>  El círculo de amistades que pueden ayudarle no?tiene que limitarse a los seres humanos. Cierto veterinario dijo: “Los problemas más grandes a los que se enfrentan las personas de edad avanzada no?son las enfermedades físicas, sino, más bien, la soledad y el rechazo que sufren.?[...] La compa?ía de los animales (entre ellos los perros) [da] propósito y sentido a las personas de edad avanzada en un tiempo en que es común que vivan apartadas de la sociedad”. La revista Better Homes and Gardens dijo: “Los animales de compa?ía contribuyen al tratamiento de los que padecen trastornos emocionales; animan a los que sufren enfermedades físicas, a los disminuidos y a los minusválidos, e infunden fuerzas a los que se sienten solos y a los ancianos”. Un artículo de otra revista decía lo siguiente acerca de las personas que empezaban a interesarse en los animales de compa?ía: “Las inquietudes de los pacientes disminuían, y podían expresar amor a sus animales de compa?ía sin temor a ser rechazados. Más tarde comenzaron a comunicarse con las personas; lo primero de lo que hablaban era del cuidado de sus animales de compa?ía. Empezaban a sentir que tenían una responsabilidad. Se sentían necesitados, algo dependía de ellos”.<br>  <br>  Muchas veces, la persona que se siente sola no?se recobra lo suficiente como para ayudarse a sí misma y salir de las profundidades de su desesperación. Se manifiesta una inercia, una desgana por esforzarse hasta ese grado; pero si quiere saber cuál es la verdadera causa de sus sentimientos de soledad, tiene que hacerlo. El Dr.?James Lynch mencionó que las personas oponen resistencia a los consejos que encuentran difíciles de aceptar: “La condición humana es tal que generalmente nos resistimos a oír, o por lo menos a incorporar en nuestro comportamiento, aquella información que no?nos gusta”. Es posible que una persona quiera superar su sensación de soledad, pero quizás no?esté dispuesta a tener la fuerza de voluntad necesaria para lograrlo.<br>  <br>  Compórtese tal como quiere sentirse<br>  <br>  Para superar una depresión grave, debe hacer todo lo posible por persistir en manifestar verdadera alegría y amabilidad. (Compárese con Hechos 20:35.) Esto exige romper las barreras de la soledad y su desgana letárgica, y cambiar diametralmente de comportamiento. Actúe con brío, muévase animosamente, cante algo alegre. Haga cualquier cosa que refleje felicidad. Exagere este sentimiento, no?tema pasarse, abandone el estado de ánimo taciturno y sustitúyalo con pensamientos positivos. ?Como cuáles?<br>  <br>  Como los que se recogen en Filipenses 4:8: “Finalmente, hermanos, cuantas cosas sean verdaderas, cuantas sean de seria consideración, cuantas sean justas, cuantas sean castas, cuantas sean amables, cuantas sean de buena reputación, cualquier virtud que haya y cualquier cosa que haya digna de alabanza, continúen considerando estas cosas”.<br>  <br>  Necesitamos dar sentido a nuestra vida. Cuando la persona percibe que su vida tiene un propósito, se siente estimulada a responder a dicho propósito y procura cumplirlo. No?es probable que se hunda en un sentimiento de soledad y desesperanza. Esta idea se explica de forma muy interesante en el libro El hombre en busca de sentido, de Viktor Frankl. El autor enlaza esta cuestión con casos de prisioneros en los campos de concentración de Hitler. Aquellos cuya vida carecía de sentido sucumbían a los sentimientos de soledad y perdían las ganas de vivir. Pero “la conciencia del amor propio está tan profundamente arraigada en las cosas más elevadas y más espirituales, que no?puede arrancarse ni viviendo en un campo de concentración”. A?ade: “El sufrimiento deja de ser en cierto modo sufrimiento en el momento en que encuentra un sentido, como puede serlo el sacrificio.?[...] El interés principal del hombre no?es encontrar el placer ni evitar el dolor, sino encontrarle un sentido a la vida, razón por la cual el hombre está dispuesto incluso a sufrir a condición de que ese sufrimiento tenga un sentido”.<br>  <br>  Una relación fundamental para usted<br>  <br>  Para llegar a tener un punto de vista verdaderamente espiritual, tenemos que someternos por completo a Dios y a su Palabra, la Biblia. La fe en Dios y la oración sincera a él pueden dar sentido a nuestra vida. Entonces, aunque las relaciones humanas desaparezcan, no?estaremos solos, no?estaremos condenados a la soledad. Como dijo el Sr.?Frankl, el sufrimiento con sentido es soportable, incluso puede llegar a ser una fuente de gozo. Cierto observador de la naturaleza humana dijo: “Un mártir en la hoguera puede tener una felicidad que para sí quisiera un rey en su trono”.<br>  <br>  Los apóstoles de Cristo experimentaron el gozo procedente de Jehová cuando fueron objeto de persecución; tal sufrimiento tenía un gran sentido para ellos. “Felices son los que han sido perseguidos por causa de la justicia, puesto que a ellos pertenece el reino de los cielos. Felices son ustedes cuando los vituperen y los persigan y mentirosamente digan toda suerte de cosa inicua contra ustedes por mi causa. Regocíjense y salten de gozo, puesto que grande es su galardón en los cielos; porque de esa manera persiguieron a los profetas antes de ustedes.” (Mateo 5:10-12.) En Hechos 5:40,?41 aparece esa reacción: “Mandando llamar a los apóstoles, los fustigaron, y les ordenaron que dejaran de hablar sobre la base del nombre de Jesús, y los dejaron ir. Estos, por lo tanto, se fueron de delante del Sanedrín, regocijándose porque se les había considerado dignos de sufrir deshonra a favor del nombre de él”.<br>  <br>  Donde cultive una rosa no?puede crecer un cardo<br>  <br>  Siembre en su mente semillas de belleza y de propósitos positivos; no?deje lugar para las semillas de la desesperación negativa y la triste soledad. (Compárese con Colosenses 3:2; 4:2.) ?Difícil? En ciertas circunstancias parece imposible. Una poetisa dijo: “Donde cultive una rosa,?[...] no?puede crecer un cardo”, palabras que de nuevo indican que hace falta un verdadero esfuerzo y una gran fuerza de voluntad. Pero se puede conseguir, y se está consiguiendo.<br>  <br>  Fíjese, por ejemplo, en el caso de Laurel Nisbet. Contrajo la polio, y a la edad de 36?a?os la colocaron en un pulmón de acero, donde pasó treinta y siete a?os tendida sobre la espalda. Como estaba totalmente paralizada del cuello hacia abajo, no?podía mover más que la cabeza. Al principio se sintió totalmente desesperada. Pero después de pasar casi un día compadeciéndose de sí misma, decidió que así no?podía seguir. Tenía dos hijos que criar y un esposo que atender. Empezó a rehacer su vida; aprendió a llevar su casa desde un pulmón de acero.<br>  <br>  Laurel dormía muy poco. ?Qué hacía durante las largas horas nocturnas? ?Cedía a los sentimientos de soledad? No. Oraba a su Padre celestial, Jehová. Oraba pidiendo fuerzas para sí misma, a favor de sus hermanos cristianos y también solicitando oportunidades de hablar a otros del Reino de Dios. Pensaba en maneras de predicar, e impresionaba a muchos por su predicación a favor del nombre de Jehová. No?permitió que en su corazón creciesen cardos de soledad; estaba muy ocupada cultivando las rosas.<br>  <br>  Esa fue también la actitud de un misionero de la Watch Tower llamado Harold King. Dado que fue sentenciado a pasar cinco a?os incomunicado en una prisión china, alguien pudiera pensar que era un candidato perfecto para experimentar un largo período de soledad. Sin embargo, rechazó esa actitud negativa y con gran tesón encauzó sus pensamientos en otra dirección. Tiempo después explicó lo que hizo:<br>  <br>  “Me hice un programa de ‘predicación’. Pero ?a quién predica uno cuando está incomunicado? Decidí preparar algunos sermones bíblicos apropiados basándome en las ideas que podía recordar, para luego hablar con personas imaginarias. A continuación me puse a predicar, por decirlo así, llamando a una puerta imaginaria y dando el testimonio a un amo de casa imaginario; visitaba varias casas durante la ma?ana. Con el tiempo encontré a una se?ora imaginaria llamada Carter, que mostró algo de interés, y después de visitarla varias veces, empezamos un estudio bíblico regular. Durante el transcurso de dicho estudio abarcamos los temas principales del libro ‘Sea Dios veraz’, según yo los recordaba. Hice todo esto en voz alta para grabar estas cosas aún más en mi mente.”<br>  <br>  Los miles de testigos de Jehová confinados en los campos de concentración de Hitler podían haber obtenido su libertad con solo renunciar a su fe. Pero muy pocos lo hicieron. Miles murieron fieles, algunos ejecutados y otros de enfermedad y desnutrición. Cierto Testigo llamado Josef estaba recluido en un campo de concentración y tenía dos hermanos en otros campos. A uno de ellos le obligaron a tenderse boca arriba para ver descender la cuchilla que lo decapitó. Josef explicó: “Cuando otros [Testigos] del campo se enteraron, fueron a felicitarme. Su actitud positiva me conmovió profundamente. Para nosotros era más importante la lealtad que la supervivencia”.<br>  <br>  A su otro hermano le preguntaron si deseaba decir algo cuando estaba frente al pelotón de fusilamiento. Pidió permiso para hacer una oración, y se lo concedieron. La expresó con un patetismo tan conmovedor y un gozo tan sincero, que cuando se dio la orden de hacer fuego, ningún soldado del pelotón obedeció. Al repetirse la orden, hubo un solo disparo, que le dio en el cuerpo. Furioso, el comandante sacó su propia pistola y culminó la ejecución.<br>  <br>  Qué puede dar verdadero sentido a la vida<br>  <br>  Todos estos casos implicaron tener una fe firme en Dios. Cuando se ha probado todo lo demás y ha fallado, la fe siempre está ahí para vencer la soledad y hacer que se llene de sentido una vida antes vacía. Muchas vidas que son significativas según los criterios del mundo, en realidad carecen de sentido. ?Por qué? Porque esas personas acaban muriendo, vuelven al polvo y quedan sumidas en el olvido sin haber dejado ninguna onda en los mares de la humanidad ni huella alguna en las arenas del tiempo. Es como dice Eclesiastés 9:5: “Porque los vivos tienen conciencia de que morirán; pero en cuanto a los muertos, ellos no?tienen conciencia de nada en absoluto, ni tienen ya más salario, porque el recuerdo de ellos se ha olvidado”. Cualquier sentido que se atribuya a una existencia vivida al margen de los propósitos de Jehová no?es más que hueca vanidad.<br>  <br>  Al mirar los cielos estrellados y observar la inmensidad de esa oscura bóveda celestial, ?qué insignificantes nos vemos! Podemos comprender realmente lo que sentía el salmista David cuando escribió: “Cuando veo tus cielos, las obras de tus dedos, la luna y las estrellas que tú has preparado, ?qué es el hombre mortal para que lo tengas presente, y el hijo del hombre terrestre para que cuides de él?”. Salomón, el hijo de David, desestimó las obras del hombre diciendo que “todo es vanidad”, y razonó así: “La conclusión del asunto, habiéndose oído todo, es: Teme al Dios verdadero y guarda sus mandamientos. Porque este es todo el deber del hombre”. (Salmo 8:3,?4; Eclesiastés 12:8, 13.)<br>  <br>  En resumidas cuentas, ?cómo puede alguien que se sienta solo, o cualquier otra persona, dar sentido a su vida? Viviéndola en el temor de Dios, obedeciendo sus mandamientos. Solo así podrá encajar en los propósitos del Creador de este vasto universo y ser una parte de esa organización eterna de Dios.<br>  <br>  Si Dios está con usted, nunca estará solo<br>  <br>  Una fiel testigo de Jehová africana dijo tras aguantar una terrible persecución y llegar a sentirse abandonada que aunque las personas allegadas le fallaran, no?estaría sola. Citó las siguientes palabras del Salmo 27:10: “En caso de que mi propio padre y mi propia madre de veras me dejaran, aun Jehová mismo me acogería”. Jesús opinaba lo mismo. “?Miren! Viene la hora, en realidad, ha llegado, en que serán esparcidos cada uno a su propia casa, y me dejarán solo; y sin embargo no?estoy solo, porque el Padre está conmigo.” (Juan 16:32.)<br>  <br>  Jesús no?temía estar solo. A menudo buscaba deliberadamente momentos de soledad. Aun cuando no?había nadie a su alrededor, no?se sentía solo. Abría su corazón para recibir el espíritu de Dios, y al encontrarse rodeado de Sus creaciones, se sentía cerca de él. A veces eludía la compa?ía de sus congéneres para poder estar a solas con Dios. Jesús ‘se acercó a Dios y Dios se acercó a él’. (Santiago 4:8.) Sin duda fue el amigo más íntimo de Dios.<br>  <br>  Tener un amigo del tipo que se describe en las Escrituras es de un valor inestimable. (Proverbios 17:17; 18:24.) La Biblia dice que por su fe absoluta en Jehová Dios y su obediencia incondicional a él, Abrahán “vino a ser llamado ‘amigo de Jehová’”. (Santiago 2:23.) Jesús dijo a sus seguidores: “Ustedes son mis amigos si hacen lo que les mando. Ya no?los llamo esclavos, porque el esclavo no?sabe lo que hace su amo. Pero los he llamado amigos, porque todas las cosas que he oído de mi Padre se las he dado a conocer a ustedes”. (Juan 15:14,?15.)<br>  <br>  Con amigos como Jehová Dios y Cristo Jesús, ?cómo no?van a poder combatir y superar la soledad los que tienen fe?|`|L6EwXeGaaa	Es mas comun de lo que crees, pasamos por estas estapas, en que todo te da igual todo es lo mismo!! y no le encuentras sentido a nada, he pasado por eso, tuve un periodo muy largo asi, nada tenia sentido, todo me daba igual, el motivo es muy variado desde baja autoestima hasta perdida de esperanza, tal vez el cumulo de cosas del dia a dia, el temor al futuro, han hecho que pases por esto, pero es solo una etapa, hasta que pase algo en tu vida que te haga recuperar el estimulo, mi solucion fue fijarme una meta! cuando te fijas una meta, la que sea, te empiezas a sentir nuevamente estimulada por que vas en pro de algo, y tienes que lograr cosas para poder conseguir la meta, vuelves encontrarle sentido a las cosas, y a luchar, a veces deseamos que las cosas cambien y todo sigue igual esto te crea frustracion y te hace perder interes en todo en general, pero esto que ye digo me ayudo bastante, asi que trata no pierdes nada con intentar, suerte!|`|Nmwibkadaa	vaya yo tambien ando pasando pro algo similar a lo tuyo<br>  estoy muy arta de todo<br>  no veo caso al por que de las cosas<br>  a veces me cuestiono todo de forma sentimental y racional.<br>  en si.. nadie me quiere como yo quiero.. se que eso suena egosita pero a veces seria bueno ver que alguien te quiere de igual forma como tu.<br>  uno hace cosas hasta el cansancio pro otros y esos otros no demuestran que les importas...<br>  a veces me pregunto si tiene sentido la vida.. que tanto puede hacer..<br>  se puede disfrutar cosas pero llegan a su limite no??<br>  si ya las disfrutaste entonces para que seguir??<br>  ahh no lo se espero pronto tu encuentres sentido a la tuya<br>  dicen que enamorarse y ser correspondida sirve.. a ver las cosas desde otra perspectiva pero no lo se...<br>  aun...<br>  espero tu estes mejor pronto..|`|O2d49hsOaa	bueno, mira... todos tenemos momentos asi a veces un poco depres y nose diga si se llega el invierno y uno siente asi como q nostalgia y soledad.. verdad? pero ps a veces es rico vivirlo, cuando sientes q algo te falta hay q saber disfrutarlo para asi tambien valorar lo q tenemos... y pues algo q te va ayudar mucho en disfrutar la vida es mantenerte siempre ocupada en actividades q te latan y q te ayuden a conocer gente y encontrarle cosas emocionantes a la vida juntos... a veces uno piensa en una pareja pero la verdad es q hacerte de un buen grupo de amigos no sabes como lo vas a disfrutar... saludos!!<br>  <br>  pd: cuando gusten platicar conmigo... ya saben, aki toy...|`|TWMKcW5Vaa	TRANQUILA, ES VERDAD ES UNA ETAPA DE LA VIDA PERO OJO, SI NO LO SUPERAS SE CONVIERTE EN ALGO MALO.<br>  <br>  YO TE ACONSEJO QUE REALICES ALGUNAS ACTIVIDADADES PARA QUE TE DISTRAIGAS, POR EJEMPLO: APRENDER ALGO NUEVO, SALIR A PASEAR, IR AL CINE O ALQUILAR UNA BUENA PELICULA (SEGUN TU CRITERIO), VISITAR A ALGUN AMIGO,O TAL VEZ SI TE GUSTA TOMAR FOTOGRAFIAS COMO YO Y PENSAR EN UN PROPOSITO Y TRATAR DE CUMPLIRLO|`|af17817497aad009fe90e680ad005d8baa	de hecho son varios factores los que intervienen en el proceso, puede ser tu baja autoestima, el medio que te rodea, la rutina que sigues en tus actividades cotidianas, en fin, lo que te recomiendo es que hagas cosas diferentes a las que estas acosttumbrado a hacer, metete a un club, o lee un libro, arma un rompecabezas, en fin has cosas diferentes, a veces la monotonia nos consume y nos hace ver la vida como si fueramos seres que trabajamos y repsiramos, si puedes tambien podrias hacer algun servicio social o ayudar a alguien en algo eso tambien te ayuda, haz ejercicio, ya que el ejercicio ademas de ayudarte a estar en forma puede eliminarte la tension y la mala actitud, vete a correr, o a jugar algun deporte en grupo eso me ayudo muchisisimo, yo era una persona demasiado apatica y no queria experimentar cosas nuevas, y cuando me uni a un club de baloncesto me di cuenta de que hay muchas personas que te estiman y te apoyan, ademas tambien te recomiendo que tomes vitaminicos por que hay algunas sustancias que el cuerpo a veces no recibe en lascantidades apropiadas y eso tambien intyerviene en ver la vida de manera muy sumisa|`|b4GL143naa	solo es una etapa de la vida eso para hasta q encuentras a la persona que te debuelve la esperanza|`|bPE5Rsd1aa	puede ser eso o q estes pasando un mal momento. hace cosas q te gusten para sentirte mejor.

Me encuentro en la misma situación.  Ella me torturó durante un mes diciéndome hoy te quiero y m?ana no te quiero, mientras ya estaba con otro chico desde hacía tiempo, y eso después de tres a?os de relación.  Era la persona que más quería en el mundo y sentir esa traición me llenó de dolor que hoy aun no soy capaz de superar después de dos meses de no saber nada de ella.  Has de desconectar y aunque duela no te dejes arrastrar ni manipular, afronta la realidad desde el primer día porque luego saldrás peor parado cuando el resultado sea el mismo, que ella ya no te quiere.  Ella fue capaz de desestructurarme de tal forma que sigo sin encontrar mi personalidad, la persona que era antes.  Supongo que el dolor seguirá ahí durante mucho tiempo y no sabes cuanto deseo que llegue el día en que solo sea un recuerdo lejano.  A veces también pienso que simplemente la echo de menos porque no está ya a mi lado... no sé si es amor, obsesión, o simplemente que echo de menos a alguien.  Aunque por otra parte pienso que no sería capaz de estar con otra persona ahora porque ella sigue invadiendo mi alma y mi mente.  Es difícil, pero ánimo,... dicen que todo se supera y espero que sea así porque no me imagino una vida con tanto sufrimiento como el que acumulo estos meses.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Es difícil pero no imposible, a veces Dios nos pone en el camino a diferentes personas que no son las indicadas para que cuando llegue la que es para nosotros la sepamos querer y amar.<br>  <br>  En la vida todo pasa y el amor también, toma eso como una experiencia más y un aprendizaje de vida. Piensa que no eres el único ni serás el último que tenga 3 o 5 rompimientos amorosos. Solo te aconsejo que aprendas de ellos, saca lo positivo que te dejo cada relación y desecha lo negativo.<br>  <br>  Sigue adelante que todos en el mundo tenemos a nuestra otra mitad o alma gemela esperando por nosotros en algún lugar del mundo.<br>  <br>  No desgastes tus energías en esto, pensando de porque sucedió, etc. Piensa en estar bien tu, cambia de look, hazte un corte de cabello diferente, cambia de ropa, de perfume sientete un hombre diferente y verás la vida de otra manera.

Pasa el dolor una vez que seguramente la persona que te rompió el corazón no esta pensando en ti.<br>                    Cuidate mucho.
lBm7fAKdaa	Ummmhhh...los 2 a su justa medida...El sexo anal tiene su encanto, pero la sola penetracion anal no hace a ninguna mujer orgasmar. La alternacion de penetradas anales y vaginales en un solo acto sexual es una cosa deliciosa, y satisface plenamente a nivel psicologico por que deja con la impresion de haberlo dado/poseido todo. El sexo anal, sin penetracion vaginal, es apreciado por aquellas mujeres que han explorado satisfactoriamente su sexualidad y son capaces de conseguir placer dando placer...que rico!!!....Difiere un poco de la penetracion anal entre 2 hombres, ya que el pene dentro del ano estimula la prostata y en este caso si hay un placer fisico fuertemente presente, y ellos la disfrutan terriblemente....( incluyo en este caso aquellos hombres que se dejan penetrar por sus mujeres sea con aquellos de plastico o cualquier otro objeto)...El sexo anal bien hecho es una de las cosas mas ricas que entre 2 se puede hacer....ummhhh...|`|Ugu6Psukaa	Siii.

The best resolution isn't necessarily getting rid of her, but actually embracing your age and removing yourself as a source of controversy. Go get a roommate and move out. Your father obviously loves her or is staying with her to take care of you. You are an adult and you need to wake up and stop complaining about her, stop obsessing about getting rid of her and just remove yourself. You have the ability to change things if you seize the opportunity.  If you are a student and cant work, look into getting a loan to get moved in on campus. You don’t have to be there. Your life will be easier if you take responsibility and start to make decisions that affect your future on your own. You can't remove her from power if you don’t take control and do something to take care of yourself. The sad truth is you are under her roof and you are always going to be at her mercy. The best thing you can do is to take that power away by making yourself your own keeper.  It's a scary world but aside from poisoning her food and hoping she drops dead! You have to let your father decide what is best for him. Which means you have to decide what’s best for you and obviously you have to get out and do what is right for you. It's not easy to actually do, but where there is a will there is a way.  Maybe by removing yourself from the situation she will not have anything to complain about anymore and she will start to show her true colors to your father and he will see what you have been saying all along.

Of course, she is older and she wants deeply for you and her to bond closer, but she just has a very funny way of going about it.  She wants you to love her and respect her opinion.  <br>  Believe it or not, the troubles you are having are normal as you are trying to be your own independant person.  The problems and power struggles you describe are just the same for real parents as they are for step parents. However, I notice in your email that you have singled her out as 'different' with the asian comment, and you view it as 'you against her'.  My daughter is 18 and she has the same problems that you described but with me.  <br>  Perhaps it would be helpful to try to tear down the walls that you have between you two, stop pointing fingers (because when you point a finger look at your hand....there are three fingers pointing right back at you), and figure out a way to work together instead of in competition.
s0tj0Yt8aa	Why would you want him? You can find a nicer man to be the dad who cares!|`|AA10986891	If he doesn't want to be part of daughters life then it is a shame, it is his loss. Why would you want him to be part of your daughters life if he is always going to be making escuses and demands in order to be part of her life?<br>  <br>  Your daughter is better off with out him. He is horrible man and a coward and I wouldn't be surprised if he had hitted you in the past. You and your daughter are better off with out him. A real dad would be there for her daughter no matter what, no escusses, no demands no nothing, he will do anything to be part of his daughters life.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	How could you even consider robbing yourself and daughter of income that you will need to raise her by some guy who didn't even have the decency to come see his daughter being brought into the world.  It sounds to me that you are both better off not having any relationship with this guy.  Keep taking the support, because even if you don't need it now, put it aside for college or the things you cannot predict when they arise.  This guy is angry because he didn't think or have any regard for safe sex, now he has to be responsible for his actions.  There may come a point in time that he will mature and regret the years he chose not to have a relationship.  Until that point, you raise your little girl and don't do anything foolish.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	be honest with yourself, pick up your pieces and get on your feet, he will never be around, so just think about you and your daughter, you deserve to be happy and free, free yourself of him and keep busy, think logically not emotionally, logically he is not there & never will be , you should Move on with your life, but emotionally, its hard, logically you can and you will have a good life take baby steps and over time it will get easier, avoid him and every where he might be. good luck, ill pray for you|`|9ro8fiKvaa	He needs to pay child support ... peroid. Whether you let him off thehook for this or not, he will NEVER be the parent you want him to be for your daughter. It's up to you to be the parent your daughter needs. To do this you will need the support of friends and family - use them for it! Both you and your daughter will appreciate it. Gone are the days of a "parents" consisting solely of a Mom and a Dad. You can do it - let the only contact you have with this man be a finacial one. You and your daughter will appreciate it in the long run. Good Luck with everything.
93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Talk to him about his father's behavior toward his mother.  Ask him if that is what a husband should do to his wife.  Then tell him that is what he is doing to you.  Tell him is is unacceptable for him to follow after his father's behavior patterns.  Insist on your own checking account where you can deposit your earnings and thus contribute to the family expenses.  If he insists on controlling the finances because he is the man of the house, then he needs professional counseling.  He is not ready to listen to you but might listen to another outside opinion.  Ecclesiastical counseling may also be advisable.<br>  Best wishes.  <br>  In the mean time, try to focus on his good qualities and remember to compliment him when he does something good.  If he feels the love coming from you then he might be more willing to send the love back to you.  Men can be very basic at times.  We are not nearly as complicated as women.  Try it.|`|GPn55rjTaa	How a man treats his wife will directly reflect on how he was brought up during his childhood.  The chain can be broken, but usually only with a small percentage.  When my husband is at his worst I catch myself saying, "I married a man whose Father treats his Mother like crap."  My husband isn't even 1/2 as bad as his Dad.  If he was I would never have married him.  But at times when he is really mad, I can see his Dad.  I pray about it and that seems to help.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Divorce is not the answer.  Communication, problem solving, negotiation is.

You need to have a long, serious talk with your husband...and explain how you feel.<br>  <br>  Chances are he is adjusting to this situation as well, and he needs to know his attitude isn't helping you much. Counseling or therapy sounds like a good idea as well. If he doesn't want to go with you, go on your own.<br>  <br>  What is important is that you don't let him and his attitude ruin your self-esteem or make you feel bad about who you are. I'm your age and I feel good about my life right now....Keep taking care of yourself, both in the inside and on the outside!|`|sLLgERQWaa	Hold a 'Come To Jesus' Meeting with the hubby and lay it on the line.....<br>  <br>  If he wants his marriage to stay intact he must...<br>  1) Knock off the name calling<br>  <br>  2) Accept that you BOTH handle the finances jointly if you contribute half the money<br>  <br>  As far as him looking at you 'that way,' maybe quietly informing him that there are other men out there, especially younger ones, who will.....an experienced mature woman who works/supports herself and looks good is a 'hot ticket' for many men of all ages.Maybe you should dress a little classy-sexy occasionally when you two go out-let him SEE other men looking at you THAT WAY.Good luck.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	My husband is like this.

Not everyone can like one. and vice versa. Not everyone can dislike you either. God doesnt let it work that way. If there's someone who hates you, to hell with them. First of all, a nice person wouldnt ever SAY that he/she hates you coz even if someone "worth" hates you, that person wont be hurting you, coz if ur sopposedly "hate-worthy", they wouldnt want to hurt, they'd just ignore you. when i was in school, i dont know what vibe i gave out, ppl had negative feelings towards me. As i grew up, I realised that I've been blessed with some qualities that they DO NOT have. Im not saying that they're deliberately jealous and that's why mean, but its the subconscious mind that decides who to like, who to dislike. Just consider ppl you hate (celebrities or real people). There are many you hate coz "THEY" are doing or saying things that MAKE you hate. But there are MANY OTHERS who you hate just without a reason. That can be a little jealous somewhere, which even u dont realize exists. So, just relax, ur blessed, IMO, coz ppl NEVER hate you without a reason, and u mentioned u didnt do or say anything annoying! May be ur smart or goodlooking or anything else? Think about it. I read somewhere in a personality analysis - you may not be liked by many, but those who have a good taste, YOU are their favorite. :) So, get it? Its how u look at things.Cheers!|`|2K4gvECQaa	Maybe it's your age. At some point every one feels like an outcast in the society. It will go away.

L6DZZ6SJaa	Your "wedding china" is not meant to be used AT the wedding. It is a gift from your registry to be used at your home for holidays and special occasions (Christmas, anniversary, Thanksgiving, etc... the dinners you HOST at your own home over the years). It is meant to last your whole married life and be special. It is a common gift because wedding china is expensive (typically $100-$200 per place setting, plus all the extra pieces like gravel bowls and platters). This way, individuals can buy one setting at a time as gifts, and the bride and groom do not get stuck paying for all 8-12 place setting themselves. <br>  <br>  As for your wedding day, all those are rented. Plus, you don't want caterers and waiters handling your nice china!|`|7G4hisdzaa	What the first person said!  The china you register for is for personal home use after the wedding...typically for special occasions.|`|Pwybznsxaa	No, your wedding china isn't supposed to be used AT the wedding. You use it after  you are married!|`|GaTRjViLaa	Here is a better question: Wedding china...Why?|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no, you don't eat off that china at your wedding.  reason being you haven't received all the place settings yet, you get them as gifts AT the wedding.  and the fact it is very expensive means it should be kept at your home and not transported around town.  let your caterer supply the plates and everything for your reception, it's one less thing for you to worry about.  now what most brides and grooms do is get toasting glasses engraved with your names and the date, and you get those in advance so you can use them for your champagne toast at the wedding.  but that's just for the 2 of you, not everyone.|`|AA11380378	No, no ,no you are confused.<br>  <br>  The china in the registry is for your household; a gift to use after you are married an not for the bridal party to eat of at the reception (**sigh**).<br>  <br>  Your venue will provide china with the catering, sometimes you will have to rent it depending of the venue and the catering company.<br>  <br>  Good luck

76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	the purpose of a shower is to set up the bride and groom with all the household things if they are young and living on their own for the first time.  if someone gets divorced and doesn't retain all their shower gifts in the separation, it's not the family's responsibility to buy them all over again the next time that person gets married.  I usually boycott showers for 2nd weddings or 2nd babies.  I'm happy to get someone a wedding or baby gift, but the whole act of sitting through a shower is an awful way to waste a sunday.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Oh my God....no, no, no.<br>  <br>  First of all....the mother of the bride and/or the mother of the groom should never host a shower, although in some parts of the country this is OK.<br>  <br>  And a "monetary shower?"  I have never heard of such a thing.  Totally tacky and uncalled for.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question....it is definitely NOT appropriate.|`|AA11312653	Traditionally a shower is a gathering of some circle of friends who WISH to gather and shower the bride with gifts. A bride might have multiple showers. For example, one given by her bowling league, one by her co-workers, and a third by the sewing circle of the groom's church. It is a fairly recent innovation to have showers in which the host is a sort of "promoter" who seeks to create such a group of generous friends where none exists. To promote such an event for a member of someone else's family might be a generous and kindly undertaking, but to promote such an event for a member (or soon to be member) of ones own family is GREEDY. <br>  <br>  I get hate mail on this, but I am correct. Don't take my word for it; look it up in Miss Manners. I suggest that you decline the invitation without mentioning the "seems a bit much" part.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	OK, the big red flag here is the term "MONETARY shower" meaning, they are begging for money which is tacky beyond belief so the best thing people can do here is send their regrets and not go and just send a nice card with no money.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I have heard that it is considered poor manners for the mother-of-the-bride to ever host a shower, even for the first wedding, since it is seen as being greedy to solicit gifts for your own child.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No, it's not appropriate. A gazillion times compounded because it's a money shower! Yikes!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	If the mother wants to she can. I would recommend calling it an "afternoon tea" or something similar. (just to celebrate together) NOT a shower though. and do not ask for gifts.  If someone wants to that's their prerogative (and some people will). But do not make anyone feel like this is a normal shower where gifts are expected.  And a monetary shower? That definitely is tacky! Doesn't matter if it's a 1st, 2nd or 10th marriage...it's tacky.<br>   If you are the bride, make sure everyone knows you had NOTHING to do with this. lol|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Did they really call it a "monetary shower"?  That is repulsive.<br>  <br>  So does everyone sit around and watch her open envelopes?|`|sLLgERQWaa	For a second marriage it's not really appropriate.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I don't think it's appropriate at all.  Maybe just a get together to celebrate the bride and groom both (kinda like a co-ed thing) but not her.  It's crass.|`|VnRECJJxaa	yeah sure it is, if you dont want to go just rsvp no and youre all set
qu12Mxpqaa	okay she really likes you...if she wasn't acting this way before and is now it means along the line she developed feelings for you. So just be patient with her because she is odviously inexperienced when it comes to showing her feelings towards a guy and since you guys are friends then she probably doesn't want to ruin anything or shes scared of rejection. now the question is...do YOU like her? if you do i think you should act on it because that would warm her up a bit and make her more comfortable. the best relationships are the ones that you can talk about anything and be like best friends anyways :)|`|U1pYIbHOaa	I think she definately has feelings for you.<br>  <br>  I'm usually not shy around my guyfriends but then whehn i really like a guy i become really shy. They want you to notice them and sometimes act shy becuase they're not sure how to act  because this has never happened before.<br>  <br>  Heck, if you like her...make a move....or confront her if you just want to be friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  = ] = ] = ] = ]|`|sDToOUpraa	do you like her?<br>  yeah a girl can develop a crush even like after 5 years of friendship<br>  i think you should ask her if she has feelings for you more than a friend|`|2zN9NLcBaa	she was probably thinking back to maybe a happy or sad thing thats happenedto her and keeps coming back up. Thats happens to me a lot... and im a girl. Or, a friend must have told her something she didn't want to her. Ask her about that.|`|5p937aJaaa	Ok... There is something wrong with her, and yes it is possible to develop feelings for someone after being friends for 2 years.. OR maybe she has always had feelings for you, but you were just unaware of this. Every girl is different, and yes some girls can get really shy when they like a guy or is remotely interested. So my advice to you would be.. if you do have feelings for this friend of yours, tell her. Be upfront with her. Honesty is always the best approach when dealing with this kind of situation. And maybe you will get something out of her, like she feels the same which you didnt know beforehand.|`|AA12261646	I think it is possible that she has developed feelings for you and she's not sure how to act around you anymore because of the new feelings she has. If you like her you should tell her and see if she shares the same feelings.|`|yncXVj9Qaa	I think she likes you...do you like her?  The things you're doing to figure it out don't seem to be giving you enough proof.  But it doesn't really matter if you don't like her too right?  Maybe you should just talk to her.  If that is too hard for you, try flirting with her, asking her to do stuff with you, and complimenting her.<br>  <br>  Send her a message at <a href="http://www.hikkup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hikkup.com</a> -- she won't know it was you (ask her is she has a crush on anyone...)|`|8WcQnevJaa	i think she likes you!!!|`|KPrmTdP2aa	shes afraid to commit|`|NVTpgxvbaa	hahaha.. thats cute.. i think she likes you... <br>  you should make a move while you have the chance... <br>  girls are moody!|`|ZT1ZgUHoaa	Well by the sound of it I think she likes you. As for her acting all shy, I have no idea. My guess is that she might feel a bit awkward since you two are best friends.|`|mtQx3Yuuaa	Us girls are weird and we want you to figure out we have feelings without us putting it out there....and its totally possible to develop feeling after being friends for a long time.......it happens ALOT........
BwkM8Sgwaa	Tal vez hay que saber diferenciar entre el amor verdadero y solo COSTUMBRE...<br>  <br>  Saludos...|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Jacinto, deberías analizar que es lo que le pasa, tal vez necesite tiempo, dile que mejor se separan por un tiempo a ver que ocurre. Acuerdate que a veces no podemos obligar las situaciones y para estar en una relación donde los dos se sientan mal. Es mejor separarse aunque te duela.<br>  <br>  Si en esa separación ella comprende que de verdad te ama y tu también, ten por seguro que vuelven. Eso ha pasado mucho en algunas parejas que despues de separados se dan cuenta que se aman. La lejania ense?a.<br>  <br>  Acuerdate del refran que dice. SI AMAS ALGO, DEJALO LIBRE, SI VUELVE A TI, ES TUYO, PERO SI NO VUELVE ...NUNCA LO FUE.<br>  <br>  Tu mencionas que no has hecho nada para que ella se sienta así, eso te debe hacer pensar que esta ocurriendo algo en ella y no en ti. O tal vez la relación de ustedes llegó a una rutina que tu no quieres entender. DATE LA OPORTUNIDAD TU TAMBIEN!!! Si ella recapacita volvera y si no...ya encontraras a una mujer que te quiere por lo que eres y vales y por todo ese amor que das. PERO TU TAMBIéN NECESITAS RECIBIR IGUAL.<br>  <br>  Saluditos...y toma esto como una experiencia más en tu vida, no la puedes obligar a continuar con una relación que ella no quiere en estos momentos. Toma tu la decisión a ver que pasa y así la hacer que recapacite y piense que es lo que le ocurre.<br>  <br>  Besitos..y te deseo lo mejor!!!|`|fc5f62e944d6ca68ca2664349a136da3aa	si dices que nunca has dejado de hacer cosas por ella, es por eso que no te deja, eso quiere decir que solo te usa, por eso no te deja, ademas debes de poner en una balanza lo que realmente sientes por ella, si es amor o solo costumbre, creeme sino la dejas tu ahora, despues te vas a arrepentir|`|3bErSoGLaa	En este caso se supone que el que la busca eres tú, y por eso ella está en ese plan, como diciendo pobre no puede vivir sin mí. Mejor razona si te estás  poniendo de tapete y ella, ya no te valora  por eso.|`|5d7e9df6ebacef8fcc5d4ae8bbd28ed7aa	Deberian darse un tiempo, alejarse un poco hara descubrir si aun sienten algo o no. No tiene caso seguir juntos solo para soportarse en vez de disfrutarse uno al otro.|`|7ec3dd8ce5bbc15b9f39e877630d2a1faa	Yo estoy como tu mi marido no me presta atencion ninguna y antes el no era asi ahora es todo lo contrario frio lejano yo le busco tu no te imaginas todo lo que hago por llamar su atencion y el siempre en el limbo por esa rason me compre esta computadora para asi tener con quien compartir aunque sea escribiendoles a ustedes porque tampoco tengo amigas porque desde que me case con el deje todo por el y ahora el me tiene totalmente abandonada,no te vida social con nadie,ni con mi familia,solo tengo a mi hermana,pero por desgracia ella esta enferma,y no puede compartir conmigo,y lo mas raro que esto empeso cuando nos mudamos aqui a la Florida porque antes en New Jersey no era asi era el hombre mas apasionado,ahora es pura mierda la vida matrimonial de los dos estamos juntos por costumbre no por mas nada,porque ahora ya el amor,la pasion que sentia por el se a ido bien lejos con todo el amor que le tenia,sigo con el por no estar sola y por no buscarme otro hombre en mi vida,porque hoy dia es peligroso estar saltando de una relacion a otra por tantas enfermedades,porque segun el es fiel a mi solo que se encuentra tan cansado que no tiene tiempo para el amor y el sexo,porque solo sabe trabajar,porque le gusta el dinero,pero resulta que siempre lo tengo que ayudar con sus cuentas,porque su dinero no le alcansa,esto es rutina no amor ni pasion,abres los ojos si eres joven porque todavia tienes tiempo de enpesar de nuevo,yo ya no tengo tiempo porque tengo ya 55 anos ya estoy tarde para el amor y mas si es ipocritamente,uyeeee de esa relacion te vas afrusta como lo estoy yo hoy dia,suerte y cuidate,ok.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	If you really do like the guy, go up to him and say how you really feel. Tell him that you wanted to make sure he knew that when you said "no" you were saying no to his friends fantasizing about you and him, and that you are actually interested in going out with him. That will be enough for your guy friend. Do what you want. Don't let him control your dating life. You want this guy, and he wants you, so just fix that. Let him know it was a misunderstanding and that you want to go out with him, and then you two can be together. That will be enough to drive your guy friend crazy, and, you'll be doing what you wanted to do in the first place.
MuVKeK8faa	Yes, and it makes me sick.  It's best to back away from them b/c it won't get any better or any less akward.|`|weE5FxCfaa	mine is worse, my hubby's BROTHER hit on me.  he came by when he knew my hubby was at work.  i wouldn't even let him in the house.  he used to call me all the time too.  i think it was a competition thing with him, to see if he could "nail" is little brother's wife.  well i thought my hubby was gonna kill him.  thankfully we live in a different state now and only see him about once a year.  i always make sure i am never alone with him because to this day, 10 years later,  i still feel very uncomfortable around him. on the other side some of my friends have a crush on my hubby, but it is all very light hearted and harmless|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	You have to stand up for yourself and tell him to back off! Whether the wife is there or not. Let them both know that his advances aren't wanted or appreciated. He will be embarrassed and knock it off.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Eh, a little bit.  I have far more of an issue with my friends hitting on my husband.  I swear if I gave a green light they'd all want him.|`|GegQJNzSaa	this is kinda what you are talking about. I was married for 20 years.In that time nothing like this happened. Once we were divorced every single friend of my husband were pounding at my door to ask me out! Hubby was upset,I was flattered,but never went out with them!|`|FpKAPOe4aa	yea im 17 <br>  <br>  and her dad is 40<br>  <br>  ewwww. MIEDO|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I have had this happen many times while she was there or when they weren't. I have just been the person that I am. I addressed it right then and there and let the friend know also what a looser they had.|`|kM9xoajHaa	yes, and i told him to stop or i was going to tell my husband
kYfoa03haa	It didn't screw you up. I have been there. I was with a guy when I was younger who did every drug under the sun and cheated on me. I put up with it for a couple years. When I finally left and found a great guy and a healthy relationship it was weird. I felt like I didn't deserve it. It was surreal that I was happy and there was no drama surrounding my life. When you are with someone on drugs and your relationship is chaos, you tend to feel that every relationship is that way. It's okay to be happy and not have drama. You'll be okay. Just remember you are lucky to be in a peaceful relationship. If you continued the relationship with someone on drugs, it only gets worse and there is no future in it because drugs will always be that person's number one. Good luck!|`|LT7TqDLdaa	YES! with my husband who I am currently married to. yeah it did mess you up a bit.  but when you got out of that relationship you should not have got involved seriously with someone for about two years.  just so you can shake off all that dust.  it got so bad that i started using drugs just to be with my husband and so we didnt have to argue anymore. but i did more harm than good with that little stunt.  but drugs was never my cup of tea. but live will make you act strange.  today i am ok, however i do believe my husband still struggles with his demons to resist the use of drugs and he has been drug free for three years now. but i dont let my guards down either. you did the right thing leaving but got involved with someone else too fast.|`|28d89d73cfa630ce9da9343770880c69aa	It'll take some time to get use to it. You'll enjoy the relationship a lot more, and hey you don't gotta put up with a bunch of crap.|`|kvaS0MP9aa	its probably better 4 you not to be with that guy and that's good your not. Let this new gut treat you right and not put that kind of stress in your life.|`|YW983pbzaa	Yes i am in one now. i don"t try to put them down for what they do,although i do try to discourage my partner from the activity their involved with.I also pray for them.|`|YFXusnT1aa	Are you serious, no way|`|1jIzBUkhaa	dump him you don't' need that, drug time is jail time.|`|k7YMROOBaa	no i havent and i wont|`|AA11596133	You need counseling.  It is not normal to wish for your relationship to have drama at all.  Normally, once you find the peace, you should be so happy with it you totally forget the past. <br>  <br>  I WAS married to a total abusive alcoholic.  Once I finally broke free of him and the dysfunction and found a man who was the total opposite, I was so elated by it all, I barely remember all the past stupid drama. <br>  <br>  PLEASE, do yourself a huge favor and seek counseling.  There is no shame in asking for help, but there is shame when you know something is not right but you do nothing about it.  Ignorance is not bliss, trust me.|`|hKax9Jl6aa	I would've never wasted my time dealing with some one like that. If you tried to help him and he doesn't want to get better, then dump him.|`|6E81yM9Eaa	To start off i want to say that yes i had someone that used drugs and it felt weird. Are you still worried about it? because if thats the problem then leave him. because sometimes it could effect you in a way that ytou find yourself in different issues and your gonna be a target. If you truly love him them help him if you need help i could help also. Ihave thy experience with people that is willing to help|`|AA11635143	Be careful that you don't take your bad habits of arguing and fighting into the new relationship.  Just take time to adjust and stop looking for drama.  Old habits die hard but you have to kill yours.|`|JwnHKTabaa	You're probably not used to being so undisturbed. <br>  Try readjusting a little more. <br>  And then watch the Maury show. lol.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	I don't know why any normal person would date a druggie for so long. Ew.
a9BMA7wpaa	i didn't read the rest only the title but i didn't have to. when u have a dream about the guy u like it means that u have true feelings for him.|`|a9BTKZ18aa	It could be because he didn't have those kinds of feelings for you before but now that he see's you with another guy,he feels some kind of new emotion.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Get a life...sounds like a Harlequin Book.<br>  As long as you gave your ex boyfriend the old heave-ho, you should <br>  conquer your dream.<br>  Strive for life and go get that dream.<br>  Good luck.|`|HtiI05Tmaa	uh.. ok this is a hard one 2 answer.. ok so i think this is how you truthly feel about this one guy that your use to love well as a friend well maybe you should stay just friends with that guy and move closer to the other guy that you were with.. thats all i can say 4 now hope i helped =]]

Histologically penis and clitoris are very similar and have same embryological origin.

The difference between males and females..is varied..by 1 different chromosome..X&Y..with that said..the male has the larger penis..the female has the small one..thats right a women has a penis..with a hoddie.|`|mPZmze1Naa	i think he jsut means that you can get aroused|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Yes! Women do indeed get little mini-erections.<br>  <br>  When they get aroused blood flow increases to her genitals and the clitoris actually gets bigger! Obviously your clitoris isn't going to make a pants tent or anything, but it does in fact become engorged with blood when aroused.<br>  <br>  The fact that the clitoris is covered by folds of skin also makes it harder to see.|`|Imn5oOWiaa	a girls clit gets swollen when aroused. <br>  that's more than likely what he meant.|`|d0brzTt2aa	The clitoris can get hard and engorged if really aroused.<br>  <br>  It's nowhere near a guy's erection though, so it's not a commonly used phrase.|`|XVygEWLcaa	the clitoris is made out of basically the same tissue as the male penis. so i guess you could say that when a woman is aroused, she gets an erection thru her clit lol. idk|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	girls do get erections which is the swelling of the clit<br>  <br>  the clit is a penis basically, when people are born, we are all girls then the male parts starts to develop|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	both guys and girls get horny. a guys erection just means he's horny. a girls erection is when she becomes wet without doing anything (intercourse)|`|drEfr9waaa	Swollen hard Cl but NOTHING compared to the penis, jeez!!

Have you never left that you are lusting?<br>  <br>  Well at least in your dreams you should have lusted and if you had got up from any such dream you should have felt it.<br>  <br>  Well sometimes thinking of sex, seeing or hearing or feeling about her man we do get erotic. We get our palms and feet to chill, feel dryness of the throat, erection of our nipples, we feel stiffening and tightening of our clitoris and hymen and you may be tempted to rub them. But even without doing you may wet yourself.<br>  <br>  Well I like a section of girls have more such emotions flowing and we do get white discharges and sometimes it wets our panties too much.<br>  <br>  This is what he means.<br>  <br>  Its the blood flow in our pubic that makes it hard. Well you will know more of these orgasmic changes once you experience sexual pleasures.<br>  <br>  Hey don't curse boys knowing these, they are always curious to know more about us. We may call them perverts but how else they are supposed to know.|`|3dtbclWPaa	i don't think he means anything you'll understand<br>  <br>  to be honest i'll tell you right now.  some people say stuff like that knowing you'll sit there wondering about it like an idiot and talking to people about it.  not like an idiot.  don't get me wrong.  if i were that guy i would probably think you were really special and not want anyone getting the idea in your head that you were an idiot.  i'm just having a bad day<br>  <br>  some people wonder why you're being weird<br>  <br>  like people who react to what people say are messed<br>  <br>  ahh i'm so sorry.  you're right i'm wrong but still don't let it hang|`|ehfSNrytaa	He is probably referring to clitoris getting engorged with blood during sexual arousal.

Take to them and maybe you will find they are nice. Or, you ask them politely to say you need your space.
ENSGrZAqaa	Hmm well I suppose some might be weirded out because its not something they arent into. Even though its a quite common fetish. I like (nice looking non odorous) feet, but for the purpose of tickling them ^_^ <br>  <br>  There should be plenty of females that either share your view or more likely will tolerate in (maybe get into it) because they care about you and want to please you. Do what she likes in return. Ease into it with her, dont start off by, hey rub my junk with your feet! That's a bit much..<br>  <br>  There is hope. I like ticking my bf and he wasn't real keen on it but now he loves it and likes to goat me into tickling him. Its all about give and take.|`|UlkQT8eeaa	I'm not freaked out about it. I've actually had a guy make out with my feet before. But I think the issue is really that women don't get any satisfaction from it. It's not a turn on like omg please touch my foot. So watching someone get off with your foot is just not satisfying. It's more like annoying. And it's strange to watch someone be so turned on by something that has no sexual arousal or satisfaction for you.|`|S6N0jSh2aa	Mike i completly agree with you i love feet there such a big turn on of me, specaily when my fiance rubs her fott up and down my lill man it drives me crazy|`|SqDXxAeGaa	i have no idea i can tell you thats like my number one thing when guys play with my feet ugh it drives m crazy........|`|RyYV3aXlaa	its because your sick Mike. and every time you think about it a puppy dies.|`|xCfHnQBbaa	It's making me hot just thinking about it!|`|5wDPoAoVaa	Hey I like my fiancee doing pedicure to me. I love him massage my feet after I have finished dinner washed the utensils, and dried the kitchen floor.  Well I love him pull my toes and jerk them a bit. He usually used to massage and give pressing through my ankles and my calf muscles.<br>  <br>  We used to sing together to some music on world-space as he presses my legs that's fine.<br>  <br>  He loves to check my heels and say if I get cracks or if I have any symptoms of getting corn and advice me of a change of slippers.<br>  <br>  I love him care for me.<br>  <br>  On week ends he used to put oil in my nails and make them feel looked after. But never would he be doing anything in particular only for my feet or legs.<br>  <br>  He will suggest or get me whatever from my head to toe.<br>  <br>  Well I love him clean my anklet or get me a new one to match my dress or a new silver one and I love him put it on my feet.<br>  <br>  But as he does them he does it with dedication and maintains verygood eyecontact thats what makes me feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  Well he knows how to make me turn on, he will press and quickly flick from my heal to toe in a way that I will almost become irresistable to the temptation.  Rarely he will kiss my toe(a very soft and simple kiss at the end of the big toe nail) but I tell him not to do it as I feel he is my equal or even higher and I don't wish to see him fall at my feet.<br>  <br>  But smell licking sucking, I did ask him right now will he wish to do that sort of a thing he says no way! No even if our feet are clean just after bath man don't go so fetish its like you are embarassing us to make us offer our entire self in passion for the fact that you will lick our feet.<br>  <br>  Most women will feel that if a man licks her feet this guy will do whatever just for sex with us right now. You go low.  Even if you dont have sex you make us feel awkward.  Do men like a women kissing his feet. What if she uses her tongue to kiss your toe? Will it excite you because within a few minutes both of you will be kissing on your lips and how does it feel to you?<br>  <br>  Well if you tickle its ok but dont make us get nervous weakness just be gentle and do whatever women like alone. Kiss on our cheek on our lips and OK you will love to be our first kid that's fine.<br>  <br>  But kissing on the butt, feet or below the navel (in the pubic region some like that its upto them) are all more than what is normal.<br>  <br>  Well if you wish to be polished or say a kind of relationship more closer to marital relationship and in marital relationship you will love physical attention care and passion love making everything more if its appropriate with proper eyecontact and touches and holds in the right places. Well you may experiment but not until you are a few years in passion.<br>  <br>  Otherwise it will look gross and the idea of intimacy may become something of an irritation in time.  The pleasantness will always make sex more pleasurable hope you got what we feel.<br>  <br>  Crimson<br>  ------------<br>  We agree its always nice if we clean our feet and maintain it as tender as possible and as soft as silk without fungus and all. You kiss a new born's feet thats like kissing rosebuds I love doing it. Or see someone do it.<br>  <br>  Well a teenager or a women who can maintain her legs and feet like Demi Moore wow what a feet to click or paint I love it.<br>  <br>  I have seen a sketch of mothers feet and a childs feet inbetween. Its a common picture of the feet alone thats nice and emotional but the point is its nice to see and slightly touch but if someone is to use his tongue as a paintbrush on our feet that's pathetic.<br>  <br>  We dont like your saliva on our feet. We dont love sucking our toes. When you have so much in a woman to kiss and suck why the feet?? You get it now? DO WHAT WE ALSO FEEL EXCITED ABOUT MAN!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Well some seem to suggest that there is nothing that is acceptable and not acceptable taboo etc. Well will you love us licking your heels as much as we could until the last of the dark mud in your heel prints are gone?<br>  <br>  Just to remind you we are pleasurable to you as you are to us. Its also true we are painful to you as you are to us. If you are asking us a opinion we give it why do you criticise our views and wish we alone change. You stop your habits to not see us frown at you.<br>  <br>  Hey do what we can say to someone you did and you would not feel embarrased to hear standing beside us. Well no woman is ashamed to say she made love to you but to say "Well my husband just licked my toes like a dog" It will sound great for us but will you be able to stand that embarrassment?|`|6UyDKkj9aa	why i haven't meet you before?|`|08y217Rdaa	There's nothing to argue. The female body is the most beautiful and harmonious shape on this planet. That would be not so without her feet. There are too many things that are considered a taboo to think and talk about. A woman who is disgusted by her own body, will never realize who she is. Society makes everyone believe that there is nothing behind the corner.|`|K8VmxvEsaa	hmmm i like beautiful clean feet too. but i love those of my husband in a more sexual way... they turn me on too.But i use my feet to play with the ''thing'' of hy hubby and i think he like it too<br>  <br>  Their is no problem in loving feet|`|55zWUXcUaa	I don't know, I am not personally into feet, but I don't see anything wrong with someone else being into them.  That's really not that freaky of a fetish.|`|BKr3y30maa	I have no idea. I love when a guy plays with my feet. Especially sucks on them.  Hmmm.....|`|z5m38gHsaa	just watch out for feet fungus..thats one mean fungus. Dont want that on your face do you? EWW
ef7Fw4Smaa	I would start with setting a date.  Then finding a place and officiant that's available for that date so you won't have to worry about it anymore!  Then after the "have to do's" are out of the way you can do the "fun" part of picking out colors, flowers, cakes, dresses, invitations, etc.  <br>  <br>  Those things don't have to be decided in any particular order - just pick one and tackle it.  Focus on one thing at a time!|`|vy3oLsyRaa	Figure out what kind of wedding you'd like to have e.g. church or civil wedding with reception.  Then, plan how much you and your fiance are willing to spend for the wedding.  Make sure you will set aside the estimate for the wedding ceremony and reception separately.  That way, you don't put too much money on one and nothing left for the other.  <br>  <br>  Since you still have a few months, you can start browsing around books and websites for ideas.  Depending on your budget, you can go with an inexpensive wedding to a luxurious wedding.  The bottom line is to list down what you expect for your wedding.  Start with that and just keep modifying or deleting ideas later on.  Keep cool.. I'm sure lots of ideas will come later on.  Good luck!|`|kYfoa03haa	You are not alone. I am getting married in July and was totally confused! <br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is pick a date to get married. It is the most important. Once you have that done, get together with your fiance and brainstorm ideas like what kind of wedding do you want (causal, fancy, beach wedding, church, etc) and what color theme would you like. Get together a wedding list so you know how many people are coming and find invitations.<br>  <br>  Getting started is the hardest part. Go to this website.<br>  <br>  www.theknot.com<br>  <br>  The BEST place to get started. You put in your wedding date and they give you a month to month to do list. It totally helps with ideas and keeps you organized. They give you lists of DJ's and venues. Other brides post their ideas to help. It is the best place.<br>  <br>  You can look into a wedding planner but sometimes they are very pricey. Try theknot.com first and see if it helps out. Good luck and congrats!|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	Try wedding wire, or the knot, just put in the words wedding time line and you can get a list of what shoud be accomplished by what date. also look up who pays for what. (traditional list) unless the two of you are paying for your own. Deptarment stores like JCpenny has a list a well as a place to register for gifts.|`|busvRidhaa	There are so many great blogs and other sites out there that make wedding planning less scary. Here's a few of my favorites: <br>  <br>  www.perfectbound.blogspot.com <br>  www.weddingbee.com<br>  www.yourtango.com/<br>  www.theknot.com|`|xFv6LirIaa	Buy as many wedding magazines as you can to give you ideas and they actually tell you what to plan on first.  First, you need a place to get married and have the reception and the sooner this is booked the better, but before you even do that, you need to find out how many people you can invite.  Make a list of people and then find a place that will fit that many people.  Then start looking for your dress and shoes as soon as possible.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	If you really feel unsure an overwhelmed, I would start by looking for and meeting with wedding planners. <br>  <br>  Go through magazines and pull out inspirational pages and pictures of designs you think could work for you. Then, separate all those images into sections (with tabbed dividers) and bring that with you on your meetings with wedding planners. <br>  <br>  Wedding planners can be as involved or as minimal (give you an outline to follow throughout planning and then be there to help on the day of). This can give you an idea of where to go from here.<br>  <br>  edit - also, a big plus about wedding planners is that they KNOW the vendors REALLY WELL. . . you won't have to worry as much about making the right photog choice, or knowing if the florist you chose has a history of delivering flowers that are sub par, etc.|`|PjyP8yEiaa	I bought a book. Made my own folder to keep everything organized in. I bought one magazine, but didn't find it too helpful. I found the internet was the best tool. <br>  First thing you need to decide on is a date, place for ceremony and reception, start working on a guest list. I made one with my mom, got his family's list and then we came up with our own. We then combined them and started cutting out people to get the list to a reasonable number. Try deciding on a theme, and possibly colors. ( I chose my favorite color and looked for something that went with that) I personally found that theknot.com was a neat site to stay organized. I can enter my guestlist, allow them to rsvp online and organize the whole thing on their site. Also you get a website where you can enter all sorts of info for your guests. It works out nice since we moved out of state. It helps us keep in touch with everyone. (you can password protect it too) Currently I am working on my seating arrangement which is part of their site. I think you just have to take it one day at a time, it gets stressful but you can do it!|`|NBmZl0mraa	Have you thought about hiring a wedding planner? I ended up hiring one and it was worth every penny. She helped narrow our choices down - otherwise we would have been interviewing 50 photographers and 70 florists or something crazy! But if you want to do it yourself, just keep to a few, specific options, and create a budget first and foremost. Mostly, remember that it's YOUR day. Do what makes you happy, whether that means a church full of roses or a bouquet of wildflowers picked that morning (and by the way, there really are good web sites out there...check out the one below).|`|eQ1phaDXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  wedding-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|x5avs3gnaa	It's really up to you about where to start, but I know it can be hard. First, I would say, look online for ideas. For cake and dress ideas, I did google image searches. I looked at david's bridal online and other places. <br>  <br>  Second, get opinions and ideas from friends (I'd say though, to still remember that it's your wedding and that they are just offering opinions - do not feel obligated to take their advice). <br>  <br>  Third, there are a lot of different aspects of a wedding, so maybe starting a notebook would be helpful.  I took a regular notebook and taped pictures of dresses, flowers, colors, and cakes in it. It helped me to have something to look at.  <br>  <br>  Also, at david's bridal online you can make a virtual bridal party with colors that they offer and dresses to get an idea of how some of that will look. You could also flip through bridal magazines at a store and jot down notes or websites that might be helpful (I found that Hastings is a good place to do this - if you have one in your area). Good Luck.

No one really knows when they are ready, all they can do is be prepared for the moment. First and fore most, study extensively; you can never know too much. Second and almost equally as important, you need to know your soft points and learn all you can about that them so they're just as good as your strong points. Then--once you know where you're at--you can begin thinking about the task at hand. Annalyse the situation and consider what needs to be done to pass it. Memorize the those things, make sure they are burned into your head for forever more. <br>  Then just jump in head first and hope for the best. <br>  Look at it this way, even if parachuters don't do things right, about 1/100 of them survive a late deployal.|`|NECU1hSWaa	Only you and your boyfriend know that (;|`|CSysSbnlaa	True, please learn to spell correctly.

Yes you COULD catch an STD and you COULD get a girl pregnant, but since you know how to use a condom the chances of those happening are slim.<br>  You have to accept that sexual life is a very important part of a relationship and not many people are willing to live without it.<br>  Or maybe the real problem is that you are afraid that you can't perform in bed as someone would expect you from your age?<br>  Well I suggest taking this step by step and talking a lot about it with your girlfriend.

Your relationship will be much better without sex, don't get so nervous and stressed. just decide not too, problem solved.|`|LLYQRmYKaa	being a virgin is far from a bad thing.  some girls prefer to be with someone that hasn't slept around; it makes them feel better and like they actually matter.  maybe you haven't quite met the right person or maybe your girlfriend just needs some time to come around to the idea.  either way, don't feel bad 'cause it is a good thing|`|IQEf57ANaa	do that you want to do, dont let anyone decided for you, if you want to stay a virgin until you find the right person or the right moment, then do it, dont care what people say, be free.<br>  <br>  freedom is the greatest gift people have, dont let it go.|`|39tz1y6Laa	it's not a big deal being a virgin and i think it's the best protection in this world from any STDs|`|clzPq9tYaa	NO<br>  <br>  i respect you for that!<br>  <br>  take your time dont rush!<br>  <br>  girls love a guy that waits<br>  <br>  look at the jonas brothers :L|`|aafaa8f2526e69d5e766fbc3d07e7c48aa	Being a virgin is not that bad. Our society has branded being a virgin a bad thing. You have stood up for something you believed in and I respect that. <br>  <br>  In today's culture men are not supposed to remain virgins until adulthood, while women are expected to be celebant. This is a double standard set forth by culture. If your current girlfriend can not accept you for who or what you are then she is not the person for you. Keep on looking and when you find the right person you will know. <br>  <br>  My advise to you now, and this is only my opinion, is to sit your girlfriend down and have a long talk with her about where you see the relationship going as well as where she sees it going and if you two are seeing something different walk away as friends not enemies.|`|da863960873e043bd6998aaa1e624d62aa	No it is not. Many people that have had sex often which that they could be one again because they either felt a) the sex experience is overrated b) they feel like they should have waited c) a bad result or d) having more respect for your body. I applaud you.<br>  <br>  You haven't ruined your chances if this girl really is worth being with. Her "not liking sex but sexual" was probably so you wouldn't feel bad about your lack of experience and she was stating that she still likes intimacy and closeness and does not have to actually indulge in the act. You did a wonderful thing telling the truth. It may actually make your bond tighter because she will feel less pressure. And when you are both ready, it may happen.|`|h0U42w2xaa	No, we're all supposed to be virgins until marriage, so we have something other than used garbage to give to our spouse, the supposed love of our life and object of our true love and parent to our future children.<br>  <br>  If people followed this simple thing, there would be a lot less killing of surprise babies, a lot less STD's, a lot less heartbreak, backstabbing, guilt, divorce/breakup, children with no one parenting them, etc.<br>  <br>  Sex was designed to be enjoyed by a man and woman who are married to each other, who have committed to stay together in good and bad times, whether poverty, sickness, or hard times come as a way to enjoy real intimacy and share the deepest kind of connection with the one you truly love. Sex without that is meaningless, so it's not surprising that she doesn't like sex if it has only ever been a using and discarding of her. It's hard when a girl gives up her entire self, her most precious treasure to a guy, only to have him ditch her like a toy that got boring.<br>  <br>  Save it for marriage, no matter how much this devastated and broken society tries to tell you it's okay to do whatever you want. Is society alright? No. Is society right on this one? No. Rise above and experience the best sex imaginable, with a committed, loving wife who has promised to love you and only you for the rest of her life. Your sexuality is a special and precious thing. Don't throw it away or treat it like it's disposable.|`|ykLAxtOpaa	Im 18, a girl, and still a virgin. I have been offered it, like you, numerous times, but because of my reiligion and the fear of getting pregnant or an std, I have always refused. THe last boy I was with dumped me because I was a virgin and the thing that hurt the most was when he said "well the first few times when we have sex, you wont be good at it, so i dont think this is going to work out." what a shitty thing to say. I think if you love a person, the sex is going to be good no matter what. I personally want like when a boy is a virgin and I think i need to find a boy that is going to respect me for being a virgin and that is going to want to have sex with me for the first time. I think that if your gf doesnt respect the fact that your a virgin and you want to give your virginity to her, then she is not the right girl for you.

También la poca atención en su arreglo personal,recuerden que al hombre siempre le gusta que su mujer esté reluciente, huela a limpio, que lo reciba ba?ada, que se arregle, lo sorprenda y no que se dejen llevar por su desaseo personal y el típico fodonguismo. Esto suena duro pero es la realidad, el marido busca en la calle lo que no encuentra en su casa.<br>  Otras veces es importante tener un detalle como el recibirlo con un beso, una caricia o unas simples palabras de amor, que se sienta el calor del hogar, que sienta que es importante en su casa, que es valorado y veràn cuánto efecto causa en el hombre esos detalles. A veces la mujer cae en el error de no mostrar interés en las cosas del marido,si a él le gusta el fut y las invita, nunca se nieguen, mejor negocien y dénle la opción que ′sí aceptan su invitación y después las lleve a bailar, eso surte efecto.<br>  Confíen en su percepción nunca se fíen de chismes que destruyen matrimonios, no se muestren soberbias pero mantengan su vanidad de mujer intacta. No discutan mejor dialoguen, sean precavidas no temerosas,muestren dignidad no soberbia y respeten y sobre todo escuchen, que no les gane el enojo porque siempre perderán, no el que grita màs es el que tiene la razón, entonces opten por conciliar y nunca se queden calladas, dígan lo que tengan en su interior pero que sientan que son escuchadas, que por ustedes no quede, el respeto no quiere decir sumisión pero tampoco sean altaneras.La fuerza física del hombre la mujer la contrarresta con inteligencia, con instinto, y sobre todo con amor. Lleva al cabo algunos detalles en tu matrimonio y verás que todo cambiará para bien y sino entonces, tu esposo está ciego y ante eso no hay màs que hacer, pero espero que todo cambie para que se armonice tu hogar. sinceramente un amigo víctor|`|QHEJkMTgaa	Lo que te puedo decir que el matrimonio , tanto como el noviazgo hay que encenderlo todo el tiempo ... tal ves si te acercas a tu marido , no te rechase y ahí te des cuenta que cada uno de uds, esta en lo suyo ! es que cuando logro sus cometidos muchas veces se olvida de lo que le costo lo que hoy tiene ! intenta revertir la situación , y no pierdas lo que hoy tienen !!|`|bwEm8cKTaa	Estoy casada hace casi cinco a?os y miesposo no cambió para nada.

Lamentablemente mi esposa depende de los estragos de la familia en el pasado. El padre de mi esposa es una persona con problemas de actitudes y bebedor, y ella ha quedado marcada con eso. Sin querer me pasa facturas por que lamentablemente como hombre que soy, trabajo en un campo que tiene que ver con las computadoras y la electronica, y lamentablemente estamos en momentos que debemos ahorrar dinero para poder cubrir con nuestras cuentas. Ella trabaja tambien, pero esta a la misma vez trabajando en la casa con mis hijos, se siente llena y no puede dividirse con todas las cosas a la vez. Creo que deberia organziarse mejor, por que realmente se esta llenando las manos. Pudiera tener menos estress en la cual refleja mucho si se organiza para poder llevar otros deberes o no preocuparse mucho por los mismo. Este estrees se ve reflejado en los ninos lamentablemente por que no puede salir de la casa como ella quiere. Yo por mi parte, soy muy sumido en mi trabajo por que todas las cosas estan muy alto en los precios y estoy tratando de poder traer comida a mi casa, y quizas me he olvidado que tambien deben salir a pasear. Pero, el amor no ha cambiado, si peleamos, pero por las personalidades que tenemos y es normal, pero no ha cambiado mi amor por ella, no podemos pretender que seamos todos iguales, al contrario, ahora hay mas amor, solo que estamos estresados con la llegada de nuestros dos hijos que fueron muy rapidos el uno detras del otro. Lamentablemente tengo un trabajo seglar que es estresante, todos los dias, aparte tengo que, lamentablemente, trabajar por mi cuenta y mantener la fama en lo que quiero hacer para que me sigan llamando en mi oficio, tengo otras responsabilidades ajenas, y acordamos en que yo entraria a estudiar para en un futuro trabajar en otro lugar y ganar dinero extra o abrir mi negocio, y a la misma vez, salir de mi problema de estres en el trabajo en la cual ella tambien esta estresada por la misma situacion. No creo que ha cambiado, creo que han cambiado los dos. Los dos estan muy ocupados en sus preocupaciones y quizas no estan comunicandose. Tambien puede ser que se estas dando tu por sentado y dejando que el Siempre tome el primer paso en todo. Tienes que tener iniciativa tambien en las cosas. El trabajo en casa es agotador, pero puedes aliviar el paso en otras cosas fuera de la casa y de vez aprovechas a salir. Ya cuando halla mas tiempo, se podria hacer salidas para diversion y no para arreglar situaciones. Mi esposa se queja que no saco tiempo para salir, ella misma sabe que estoy tratando de simplificarme para poder hacer dinero con las cosas que tengo pendiente. Ayer tuve una situacion, tenia que vender una computadora con una oferta en la cual la cliente vino hasta el lugar para comprarmela, pero lamentablemente no la tenia lista, yo queria salir pero no podia salir si ya tenia ese compromiso. Trate de avanzar para poder salir de la casa, pero ella ya no tenia ganas de salir, SE DESANIMO, ella parece que esta sufriendo de desanimo por cualquier cosa o preocupada por la situacion de la vida o esta cogiendo malos consejos de personas no adecuadas. Realmente, es una situacion que deben arreglar y no debes dejarlo ahi, debes tener la iniciativa TU de arreglar tambien las situaciones y no dejar que el se quede en la casa sin compartir contigo, si lo notas ocupado. En mi caso si yo me ocupo mucho, me gustaria que me dijeran sus problemas para dejar de hacer lo que estoy haciendo para poder arreglar la situacion, siempre estoy dispuesto a ceder sus caprichos pero necesito que me los digan ya que nunca he estado casado antes y la mujer es mas caprichosa que los varones. Quizas quiera que yo tome la iniciativa, pero , el trabajo que esta en casa, quiero solucionarlo. Ella tiene mas ideas que yo de como salir etc, pero no las mensiona, ahi creo que hay mala comunicacion. Hay mucho de que hablar pero realmente no te quedes ahi esperando, arregla las cosas rapido y nunca, recuerda NUNCA se falten el respeto diciendose palabras obsenas y de esa manera se respetaran el uno al otro por que si uno empieza a tratar mal a otro , lamentablemente el otro se defiende. No debe ser asi pero lamentablemente el ser humano actua sin pensar. Lo importante de esto es que se quieran y se solucionen para que los pequenos no imiten esa actitud. Ayer mi hija de dos Anos estaba pegandole a la mama por que estaba discutiendome un problema que tuvimos, me procupe mucho por que mi hija despues que le pego se fue a dormir y se durmio de una manera muy rara, me preocupe, pero la observe toda la noche y esta todo bien. Creo que los hijos se llevan todo a la cama y no debe ser asi, sino arreglar todo al momento y dejar las cosas asi, y despues quizas cuando las cosas se hallan aliviado arreglarlas. Que tengas Exito y no te encolerizes por la situacion, la situacion se puede reparar si deseas, si no deseas no la puedes reparar. La mente Humana es impresionante, creeme. Si piensas que es una montana, una montana es.|`|kVKu4Ricaa	Hola,<br>  me gustaría decirte que es solo en tu caso, pero la verdad que es casi la regla general.<br>  Por eso lo mejor que podemos hacer es no tener relaciones serias ya que cuando ellos piensan que ya nos tienen es cuando se dejan estar y ya no tratan de conquistarlo, y eso te lo digo por experiencia propia.<br>  una lastima.|`|lhzoq4Oeaa	No es regla general.

Así que en mi caso la falta de romanticismo no fue el problema.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Pienso que la mujer hace al matrimonio y no debe de perder nunca la coquetería y ser como cuando eran novios. Y tratar de no llegar a la monotonía. Tratar de ser creativas y mantenerlos siempre como cuando eran novios. Prepararles una cena romántica de vez en cuando, poner una botella de vino en el cuarto, vestirse linda y sexy bien perfumadita, colocar rosas e incienso. En fin INVENTAR y no dejarlos a ellos tampoco que se conviertan en MONOTONíA. Hablarles y tratar de no pelear tanto.<br>  <br>  Bueno tal vez di esta respuesta por que no soy casada aun, pero tengo amigas que si, y por lo que noto es eso.

No se si sera la  regla  general pero si es  muy   frecuente.  Yo creo que  la razon esta  en que en la actualidad  los noviasgos se  centran  mas  en los deseos sexuales  que en conocerse  y amarse .<br>  Cuando en el noviasgo  hubo poco  amor  y  hubo relaciones sexuales intensas,  en el matrimonio   pronto   se enfadan  y pasa  la ilusion  de estar  juntos,  comienzan  a pensar que su felicidad  sexual esta en  otrs  mujeres  y se disgustan porque no pueden satisfacer esa  necesidad..<br>  Es  bueno que ambos se   propongan   hacer algo  de  provecho por  ustedes mismos, con  buena  voluntad  y con deseos de salvar su  matriminio y quizas  su feliciad,  renueven  sus compromisos  de  amarse  y ser leales  mutuamente.  Si  no es posible  conseguir eso  de alguna manera,   tarde o  temprano  su matrimonio   fracazara,  con los  traumas  de  infidelidades,  y sufrimiento para los hijos.|`|UoEd9Dhsaa	M e pasa seguido, contesto mucho en yahoo y mis cosas y se pierde el romantisismo porque uno cambia también.|`|16ed3625bc512ed1e8bcd1860cda034eaa	es porque tambien se pierde la ilusion que se sentia cuando eran enamorados  ................  a veces las mujeres nos hacen cambiar   ..............|`|1FlSVCJnaa	nose pero no eres la unica a mi tambien me pasa se la lleva con sus computadoras ya no me saca a clubs, no me saca a comer , ya no me abre la puerta del carro antes me hablaba x phon y ahora nada antes me regalaba muchas flores y ahora nada etc..

Mi esposo sigue igual de carinoso y detallista que antes de casarnos. Tampoco creo que sea la regla, simplemente me toco suerte, aunque hay que recordarle algunos detallitos de vez en cuando. Porque no le preguntas a tu esposo que le pasa, porque ha dejado los detalles de lado ahora que estan casados, dile que no porque te casaste ya no te gustan las flores, que todavias te gusta salir a comer de vez en cuando y que te encantaria pasarte una tarde con el viendo una pelicula. Tal vez solo necesite un pequeno recordatorio para volver a ser el de antes. Tambien debo decirte que si tu no has cambiado, sigues arreglandote igual que antes, eres carinosa con el, si  sigues siendo la misma que antes entonces si es urgente que hables con el de lo que te esta haciendo falta; habla y veras como todo se va arreglando.|`|OZ79CDQGaa	Wanda, no es que cambien (siempre fueron asi) lo que sucede es que luego de casados les sale su verdadera personalidad porque ya se encuentran "seguros" y complacidos de haber "obtenido" lo que buscaban.  Son raros aquellos que son tal cual  desde un comienzo en la relacion.   Debo admitir que esto tambien aplica a algunas mujeres. Por eso es muy importante conocer bien, no tan solo a la pareja, sino a su familia, amistades y todo lo demas, mantener un periodo de noviazgo razonable pero ni aun asi podemos tener la seguridad absoluta. Algunos hombres son mas actores que los mas famosos de Hollywood.|`|b076211a2d491b4a7c97f7cb27ec9d04aa	Yo creo que cambia tanto el hombre como la mujer. Y es que una cosa es estar de novios, saliendo por ahí, gastando dinero y pasándolo bien, y otra es formar una peque?a empresita que se llama matrimonio, donde realmente hay que trabajar para mantenerla. Si llegan hijos rápidamente eso también influye, porque implica mayor esfuerzo todavía.<br>  Digo "mantener" en el sentido del esfuerzo económico, físico, mental, etc. No es simple.<br>  Por otro lado, es cierto que cuando uno ya tiene algo seguro, siente que no vale la pena luchar más. Las mujeres se descuidan en el aspecto físico, y los hombres se olvidan de ciertos detalles para sus mujeres. Cosas que serían imposibles de olvidar en el momento de la "conquista".<br>  <br>  Además tampoco es incierto que una cosa es "producirse" ó arreglarse porque sabemos que "nos vamos a encontrar el viernes a la noche" con nuestra pareja, entonces esperamos ese momento con ansiedad, que tener TODO EL TIEMPO a esa persona al lado tuyo, en tu cama. La magia se pierde.<br>  <br>  Lo difícil (y acá me hago eco de una respuesta que me acaban de dar en una de mis preguntas) es encontrar la pareja ideal que te mueva el piso, te enganche para toda la vida y te llene de placer y seguridad.|`|ed56ee40ff6a2e059c5131d4d244601baa	Te has puesto a pensar en qué has cambiado tú??????<br>  Muchas esposas se quejan de eso, pero no se ponen a pensar que son menos atentas, se la quieren pasar metidas en la casa de su madre, ya no son cari?osas, sexys y para terminar pronto, delgadas.<br>  Que no digan que el físico no tiene que ver porque no es cierto, está bien que la firmeza del cuerpo se va perdiendo con a?os, pero lo que es inconcebible, es que se pongan gordas por descuido.<br>  Si tu no te has descuidado y aún así han cambiado contigo, mejor búscate otro, porque no es justo.

Telling someone they are ugly really doesn't help them any, even when it's true.|`|d27c5Bodaa	Um no. Being single is better than being in a relationship that your faking.|`|DREPOcuGaa	yea i agree...no...thats really low and stupid...get a life
XLHgiBApaa	It may be more complicated than you think.  Maybe she is your sister from a different relationship who finally got the nerve to look you up.  I would talk to your Dad and ask him what is up.  She might also be dating him....or know more about you than you think because of some complicated family circumstance.  I think you need to turn around and do your homework on this girl.  Also be open to the idea she could be a family relation you are unaware of....also be open to listening to her.  She might be trying to tell you something.|`|XVygEWLcaa	become ugly so she wont be interested anymore|`|0AYPgUQIaa	That is freaky and it would get me really mad if some nutjob would follow me, get in my home and keep touching me.<br>  Just tell her to stay away from you and be really mean to her.<br>  If she doesn't get the picture, then use some stronger measures to make her understand.<br>  It's like when you sit on the bus and some old folks sit next to you and start telling you about his life.. It can be very irritating. If you allow her to continue this she may never leave you alone.<br>  If nothing helps, ask your dad to handle this.<br>  If still nothing, restraining order.<br>  <br>  And be sure to tell her that you choose who your friend will be, not her.|`|ifC0M58oaa	This sounds like a scary movie. The mysterious girl trying to warn the soon to be victim from murder...this is so exciting...(i hope i didn't scare you) Ask her how she knows you, what she wants, and why she is acting so mysterious! This will get some answers out of her. And if she doesn't budge threatend to call the police.
K2dxDdyqaa	Maybe something bad at home/schools happened<br>  or something that she can't tell you abouts happened<br>  .. im sure it's not you, it'l be better once you see her again :)|`|PCDQ0jPmaa	Why don't you go round to see her or call her up and ask if she all right or have you done anything to offend her. The outcome might not be great but, she should hopefully give you credit for calling up. Be the bigger person by calling her but don't sink down to her level by snapping back at her. Or maybe she is on her period I dunno lol|`|mE0N72spaa	Ask her if there's any reason she's giving snappy answers, or is she just busy etc. If she says she's fine but is still being snappy just be like arrghh stop it you're making me feel bad :/ she probably has a good reason for it, something in school or at home happened etc. <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|Wa44n8RCaa	look the best thing to do is not talk to her until she comes round. I no u will have lots of questions for her just say to her ok i don't know whats up with you but i'm gunna give you the space ur obv rooting for until you settle down|`|9q9McwwRaa	what a beach <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njoXBstCAnQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njoXBstCA...</a>|`|2511eac9465f7525d4ed3fb639250d43aa	Maybe a family problem or a boyfriend problem, ask if everything is okay and try and help her out, it probably isnt you. also see if you can ask any friends who have been in school to see if anything has gone on while you have been off.|`|VaoGZIPWaa	try talking 2 her @ school, if she's just 'hormonal' [period] then its gonna happen<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  <br>  James:)|`|neLlTP2oaa	Well sometimes messages can be misinterpreted on msn.

Y tal vez eso sea una lección de vida que tenemos que aprender aunque nos duela y nuestro corazón quede vuelto en pedacitos dificil de pegar. <br>  <br>  Pero amiga, nadie se ha muerto por amor, y saldremos de esta. Eso te lo aseguro.

Solo que nuestro corazón se va poniendo más duro y desconfiado a la hora de querer amar nuevamente. No te imaginas cuanto me ha costado EL AMAR A UNA PERSONA QUE Sé....NO PUEDE ESTAR CONMIGO Y EL AMOR NO DEBE DE DOLER....PORQUE SI DUELE....NO ES AMOR....ES TRISTEZA.<br>  <br>  Bye y te envio una estrellita, me identifique contigo. y te envio energias positivas así como para mi también, para salir de este torbellino de emociones que nos tiene dando vueltas nuestro corazoncito.<br>  <br>  Ningun hombre se merece nuestras lágrimas y de eso debemos de estar seguras, pero el sentimiento es tan debil a veces, que no podemos evitar derramarlas con un dolor de amor. Me puse romantica también.<br>  <br>  A VECES EL CORAZóN NO ENTIENDE DE RAZONES Y SE PONE TERCO jejeje como el nuestro en estos momentos.<br>  <br>  EL MAYOR ERROR DEL SER HUMANO, ES INTENTAR SACARSE DE LA CABEZA AQUELLO QUE NO SALE DEL CORAZóN.<br>  <br>  Lo que es invisible para los ojos.....para el corazón no lo es.<br>  <br>  Si amas algo, dejalo libre, si vuelve a ti es tuyo....pero si no vuelve...NUNCA LO FUE.|`|e0baa1b2b4707ea343a9ac4b76e82b13aa	Es un proceso natural lo que estas sintiendo ahora.......

Todos o casi todos deseamos tener una familia, y que triste es que lo malo que hayamos hecho el dia despues lo tengamos que pagar viendo que lo que mas amamos sufre.    A veces son nuestros hijos.     Yo en lo personal pienso que Dios o la fuerza que nos creo, nos tiene aqui para crecer en diferentes areas, y que uno va subiendo o bajando peldanos hacia alcanzar una perfeccion de alma, para poder estar con Dios.   Y en la medida que no aprendemos las lecciones, tenemos que sufrir las consecuencias.   Por eso debemos tratar de ir vigilando nuestros pasos y si hacemos dano, tratar de enmendarlo de la mejor forma.   Sobretodo no hacerlo de corazon y con mala intencion, porque el mal engendra mal definitivamente.|`|LRUnN1kYaa	Pues claro que si , he visto cientos y hasta miles de personas  , que hablan de eso , y de sus desgracias <br>  <br>  Pero es , mira si tu le haces renegar a tu padre con tu comportamiento , cuando tu tengas tu hijo , y tenga una considerbale edad te hara ,o mismo que le hacias a tu padre , o peor <br>  <br>  te lo aseguro|`|WVA06DHjaa	Si toooooooooodo se paga!

Estuve 1 mes mas en mi trabajo y me reuse a pagar el dinero xq yo sabia quien me lo habia robado! me enfrente a el jefe xq me quiso descontar el dinero y lo acuse con el supervisor, y le dije que ellos eran muy amigos y me parecia que robaban juntos en la tienda! Igualmente hicieron que me fuera! llore mucho pero el mal se les devolvio a los dos! sin yo hacer ni desear nada en contra de ellos todo lo deje en las manos de Dios! quince dias despues de irme, el que me robo fue botado del trabajo xq se le extravio el doble de la cantidad de dinero que me robo a mi!!!<br>  Y al que era el jefe lo botaron tambien xq al hacerles auditoria tenia mucho dinero faltante!!! los botaron y les dieron muy malas recomendaciones para que pasen mucho tiempo sin encontrar otro trabajo!!!!!<br>  No me quice alegrar x lo que paso, pero cuando me entere, senti como dice el refran: un fresquito!!!<br>  Y es que todavia hay personas en este mundo que no creen que lo malo siempre se paga!!!<br>  <br>  Y lo bueno tambien... asi q , haz bien y no miren a quien!!!|`|gtUsY3lIaa	haber siempre se dice que todo se devuelve con la misma moneda....<br>  o sea si tu haces da?o a una persona eso no significa que la misma persona te hara da?o...incluso puede ser Otra persona que te haga da?o y decimos que nos esta sucediendo esto por hacer sufrir a otros....<br>  <br>  bueno saludos|`|xPK1dqlqaa	Sí yo creo mucho en eso.

An eye for an eye is just going to make everyone blind.<br>  <br>  Besides, spending his entire life in jail is just as bad, he'll probably think about committing suicide since now he has lost all freedom and his entire life will just be rotting behind bars in a room.|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	i believe i answered this before. i dont think anyone deserves that kind of punishment. by law, that is cruel and unusual. jail time would have been more fitting. but if it was my daughter... i dont know what i would do.  not that, but more than just jail.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	I think that if he was found guilty this guy should have had this punishment but in its entirety. There is no place in society for someone that hurts women or children in any form.

E3AKaR2Raa	Alright, Sierra.  I like that name.  We'll keep it.<br>  <br>  Listen up, Sierra.  <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend has some severe security issues.  You just said, "he actually called me over the phone crying because he said I'm going to fall for Edward from Twilight,"<br>  <br>  There are 11 problems with this.<br>  <br>  A.  Edward is not real.<br>  <br>  B.  Your boyfriend is a p-u-s-s-y.<br>  <br>  C.  Your boyfriend is jealous over A FICTIONAL character from a book.  <br>  <br>  D.  You are too nice to your boyfriend.  Your boyfriend has no balls.  He's trying to make you feel guilty over HIS insecurity.  Don't feel sorry for him.   I'm surprised you haven't left him yet.  You are more of the man in the relationship.  I feel sorry for YOU.<br>  <br>  E.  Your boyfriend.  No, I'm not calling him your boyfriend.  Like I said, you have more balls than he does.  Your "girlfriend" should have realized, if you really were obsessed with an Edward type person, you would have broken up with him by now, probably in search of a goth/vampire person at school.<br>  <br>  F.  Edward is a vampire, and vampries and humans do not fall in love.  They fall in lust.  Edward would have his way with you, but then he'll be gone in the morning.   He won't be there to make you french toast in the morning.  All you'll be left with is several bite marks on your body.  We both know that's not what you want.<br>  <br>  G.  Your "girlfriend" is stage 5 clinger.  I bet if you get in a fight, he flocks to you apologizing so he'll never lose you.  He probably thinks he needs you in order to live.   This is bad news.  Stay away from this, Sierra.  Stay away!<br>  <br>  H.  When you stand up to him, he gets all defensive and tries to blame you.  Again, you are the man in this relationship.  Don't let him walk all over you.  You are better than him.  So show him that.<br>   <br>  I.  Your boyfriend is emo.  Soon, he'll start to want borrowing your tight clothes (if he already hasn't).  He'll want to start watching chick flicks with you.  He'll start explaining how no one gets him in life, and so on and so on.  You don't want all this drama in your life.  <br>  <br>  Get out while you can, hun.<br>  <br>  J.  You're not letting yourself be happy because you're too worried about your "girlfriend's" happiness.  Seriously, he is nuts.  And I don't mean that in a nice way.  You can do better than him, Sierra.  <br>  <br>  K.  You're being sensitive to his needs.  Screw him for being such a pansy.  It's that simple.   That's not your fault.<br>  <br>  If I was in your shoes, I would have broken up with him the day he called me crying because I was going to fall in love with a character from a book.  I would have slowly hung up the phone, and thought to myself, "What the hell is wrong with this guy?"  And then I probably would have avoided him altogether.<br>  <br>  But you're a nicer person, than I am, Sierra, so you wouldn't do that.  <br>  <br>  You say your boyfriend is amazing.  yeah, amazingly insecure.  You may not think it, but you can do so much better.   Just hit the clubz with your girlz, slut it up, and go dancing!  Or go to the arcade or something.. Just meet some hot cute new guys because seriously, your "girlfriend" is creepy, obsessive, and super emo....and he's a girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. - DON'T do what Andrew said.   That's what your "girlfriend" wants you to do.  Feed into his insecurity.  He's dependent on you because he has no confidence.|`|97a7d25a569ecc28c857f02a34b7fd9baa	I used to be like your boyfriend, except girls hate me.  If your at his house or he's at your house.  explain to him that you do care for him.  Message him and spoil him.  If I had a girl that would message my muscles and would cuddle me; that would make me feel better in no time.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	I went throught that same thing! My last boyfriend was the best, but was way too emotional and insecure. I was not allowed to say which celebrities I thought were hot, and it sounds like you can't either. That is a huge sign of insecurity and it can (and will) drive the relationship into the ground. My bf would cry over random insecurities like that as well. Eventually, it really got to me and I felt like I was the mature one in the relationship and that he had a lot of growing up to do. First, I would suggest telling him that this really bothers you and he needs to be more secure with how you feel about him. Thinking celebrities or characters like Edward are hot does not mean you like your bf less. If after talking to him he does not change, break up with him and move on. I told my ex that he had a lot of growing up to do, and who knows, maybe in the future we can try it again when he has matured. Good luck!|`|zGthY1Jeaa	sorry but ur bf sounds like a total dumasS.

As a result, you can become 'weighed down' with them ....to the point whereby they possibly get in the way of your leading your own life and relationship/s.<br>  <br>  Another possible 'problem' with this is that there are some people who 'take on the troubles of others' as a way of avoiding dealing with their own problems / issues ~ whereby it becomes a convenient excuse to avoid them.<br>  <br>  On a personal level.....

De verdad lo lamento, pero lo que tu estas viviendo son muchas las personas que tambien estan pasando por lo mismo.<br>  <br>  Al decir que existen ya nietos es porque ya tendrás una edad suficiente, es decir, piensa bien antes de tratar de salirte de ese rollo que estas enfrentando. Por que te digo esto, eres capaz de empezar una vida nueva desde cero???. Acuerdate que la vida es bella, pero también trae sus cruces que cargar, no con esto te digo que sigas aguantando ya que si tu no eres feliz ten por seguro que tu pareja tampoco lo será y alguno de los dos debe de tomar la decisión de separarse o darse un tiempo para reflexionar.<br>  <br>  Nunca es tarde para reecomenzar,  y si no puedes arreglar ese problema, date otra oportunidad de vida. Mira que la vida es corta y debemos de tratar en lo posible de ser felices.....aunque sea a ratos. Analizalo y por los ni?os no te preocupes ya que siempre seran tuyos y los veras y visitaras y sobre todo no dejarás de pasarles la manutención. <br>  <br>  Los psicólogos siempre dicen que si los padres son infelices o pelean mucho eso se lo transmiten a los ni?os, y me imagino que tu no querras ver a tus hijos con traumas ahora y que también crezcan con eso. Ya que los ni?os son como unas esponjas que absorven todo. Es mejor ver padres separados y felices cada uno por su lado, que juntos e infelices.<br>  <br>  Saludos y espero Dios te de tranquilidad y entendimiento de la decisión que debes de tomar, por tu bien, el de tu pareja y sobre todo el de tus hijos y nietos. <br>  <br>  Si antes no se arreglo.....no creo que ahora con tanto tiempo se solucione. Aunque deberías es de hablar con tu pareja serenamente, invitala a una cena afuera, dile lo que te pasa, que no quieres dejarla por que la amas y por los a?os que llevan juntos y que deseas que todo cambie y dependiendo de la respuesta que ella te formule, tomas una decisión radical. <br>  <br>  Saluditos y cuidate.

Actually, the fact that you hesitated and didn't know what to say should tell you that you've already made your decision.  You're unsure, so your answer for now should be no.  Of course that doesn't mean never, it means you're not ready.  DO NOT marry someone you are unsure about.  If you can't see yourself growing old with this person, don't do it.

I was lucky enough to have friends that had their heads on straight and with a lax parental authority I brought home A's and all they did was smile and give me a thumbs up. I did it for me, and I loved feeling like I accomplished something. My parents were proud of me, they just had a hard time showing it. <br>  <br>  My little brother was like that for the longest time... he almost dropped out of highschool... he just didn't give a crap.

Getting a job is harder<br>  3. you'll never make a good amount of money.<br>  4. What woman would want to marry someone who can't support a family?<br>  5. Do you like yourself? Do you like proving that your an idiot?<br>  <br>  Some of the ways we approached him were just abusive and were more likely to make him rebel more than go back to school... but we all eased up off of him... now he's back in school and getting good grades.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest you do is make him dedicate his first 1 hour to homework and then he gets his things back...

She was always on my back about grades, even a low A wasn't good enough. It got to the point where I told her that if she couldn't accept my grades where they were, why should I keep trying? She kept up the nagging so I quit trying. My grades went down dramatically and my mom freaked out and finally gave up. As soon as she did, I worked hard and brought the grades up to a better point than they were before. So maybe you should let up a little on your son. And just encourage him to do good. Don't nag.|`|95uXmC94aa	My mom tells me that I make her feel like the worst mom in the world. It really hurts my feelings, possibly more than hers.<br>  <br>  I would set out a deal with him.

In the world today it's so easy to get caught up in the things "I" have to do that it becomes easy to forget to be a parent first.  Show your interest, work through some of the work with him, at least setting some stuff for him and build him up for what he does.  Don't lose focus on being a good parent because you can find parents all over the place, but good ones come along seldom.|`|uKr6TFxNaa	you might as well talk to a brick wall if he is 14....obviously you missed the boat when he was younger you have to start with respect, and  right from wrong when they are babies........i have always had an open relationship as a father and not a friend and my kids know there limits and toe the line .they have never been spanked and  get good grades because i am active in the schooling and social lives they lead..if they dont do whats told they get no computer, games social outings....period....i always stick to my guns if i say no computer till dishes are done it means get dishes done NOW..no games till homework means NOW.there is no negotiating from the time they were old enough to walk and talk....|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI WILMA,,,HONEY  SET HIM DOWN N TELL HIM,,IF HE CANT GET HIS SCHOOL WORK TOGETHER,,U WILL SEND HIM TO A PLACE WERE THATS ALL HE GETS TO DO,,,SOMETIMES A LITTLE THREAT WORKS,,,,,AND FOR HIM TO PROVE TO YOU HIS GOING TO CHANGE,,UNTIL HES GRADES GO UP,,YOUR GOING TO HOME SCHOO; HIM,,,AND HE WILL HAVE NO REASON,,TO SEE HIS FRIENDS,,,OR HAVE A CELL,,,NOW IF YOU WORK THAT WILL B HARF TO DO,,,SO TRY HAVING HIM,,,SET AT THE KITCHEN TABEL,,WITH HIS BOOKS,,,AND TELL HIM TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE HE WANTS TO STUDY FIRST,,,,THEN,,,GIVE HIM A CHAPTER TO READ,,,THEN TEST HIM ON IT,,,HONEY I DO NO WHAT YOUR GOING THREW,,,N I DO THINK ITS CAUSE CHILDREN TODAY,,,HAVE TO MUCH,,TO KEEP THEM,,,OCCUPIED,,,THEY THINK THEY DONT NEED SCHOOL,,,,,IF HE WAS FROM A VERY POOR FAMILY,,I THINK HE WOULD RESPECT YOU MORE,,,,,PEACE|`|9GXSpe3aaa	kids are a**holes . no matter what my mom tells me to do it doesnt chanqe what my actions are .. honestly he's just at that aqe where he becomes rebellious .. just don't qet too strict or he'll start to "hate" you and he'll be ten times worse =/ welcome to raisinq teenaqers .|`|BJuHbQXfaa	Your son is 14 at this age they go through this rebellious stage. Believe me I have been there and done that. When our son was 14 he did the same exact thing your son is doing to you.  He is at the stage where is not a child anymore and yet he is not an adult. At this age they are also going through puberty and it can sometimes really make teenager down right nasty at times.  The way I handle the situation, is I did not scream or yell at him, and I did not ground him. Now a days things are a lot different then when we were growing up. I say him down one night and had a heart to hear talk with him, keeping in mind that we were once teenagers as well.  I then listened to him as he explained what was going on his life and said to him that if he ever needs any help or needs to talk I am always there no matter what.  I also explained that it was not fair for him to take things out on me. I suggested to him to go to the guidance councilor at school about school issues. Talking to him this way and just being there did more for him then yelling, screaming or grounding him.  He improved his grades and his attitude.  It took some time but it did happen.  Be patient with him and just be there for him because he is going through a rough time as a teenager and his emotions are running in overdrive.  I hope this helped and I wish you luck.|`|LKIsoYdgaa	this is a tough one, I know.  I am going through it right now with my 13 year old son.  He has always been an A/B student until this year, 7th grade.  He also came home after Christmas with 4 F's on his report card.  We took away his computer except on weekends.  Recently he came home with a progress report.  Two of the F's were brought up to C's but the other two were still F's.  He flat out told me that the punishment wasn't hard enough and he was just being lazy.  <br>  OK, so we up the punishment.  No computer,period.  I told him his only job was to get a good education and my only job was to provide a roof over his head and to feed him.  I have hired a tutor to work with him twice a week and he knows he will get no extras from us at this time.  This includesnot having his favorite snacks and drinks in our home.  He gets absolutely nothing extra. Not even a pack of gum at the grocery store. <br>  So far he is responding positively.  He seems to be working alot harder, his teachers have told me they see an improvement in participation and attitude.  We shall see.<br>  I don't have the answers, I am just telling you what seems to be working for us.  I do have a 19 year old son that we also had this problem with and he is now in College and he has thanked us for being so hard on him during that stage of his life.<br>  We can't avoid discipline for fear that our children will hate us.  We are not here to be their friends.  We are here to be parents and all that entails.  Through all of this, both of my sons continue to love me and show respect to me.  I feel very grateful.<br>  I wish you luck with your son, I just think you can't slack off for fear of their reaction..

hjlJaxE7aa	Wow. you could not have summed up exactly what I do. it's strange but thats my initial reaction to liking a guy as well. anyways, i know its hard, but try to break away from what your use to. it's going to be really tough but im sure you can try. be nice, believe me that goes a long way,  touch him, it sends signals without even having to say anything. most importantly, be yourself. AND SMILE. <br>  oh and please show SOME interest beacause hes going to think you don't like him!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You are wasting time by not telling him fast enough.

He is probably shy also so give it a shot|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Well if your going to be like that all your life your not gonna get anywhere with the guys, your gonna have to get out of your comfort zone sometime.<br>  <br>  Seriously there is nothing you can do if you don't stop being so shy. We all try to find a shortcut, but there is none.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	is the guy interest in you , you can't run to everyone that you think likes you, there are things call cell phone, paper notes and just plain old fashion talking . tell him what you feel. don't just thank about it .|`|jvKazMgwaa	just loosen up in his presence to give him a better understanding of how his pursuit on getting to know is going.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	this situation is full of **contradictions**. i have no idea how to help you.|`|eQ5ieDbUaa	Okay first, you're jsut like me. I tell a friend first (that won't tell). Half the time my friend knows the guy I like. She takes me to sit by him. It takes me a while to warm up to him... Anyway, I start talking about how I'm single and it's be great to have a boyfriend (so he get's the memo) Then I keep hanging out with him (maybe put on blush one day so he can see that you like him I never do this) And then I get to know him. Works like a charm. Or did when I wanted a boyfriend. Btw there's no problem with being single. I love being single. :)|`|k0BF9M0Haa	Haha chillax kiddo, you still have time… all you need is a bit of practice :]<br>  <br>  The best way is to smile. I mean whenever you catch his eye just try to give him a smile from time to time. It’s going to take guts, but once you get through it it tends to get a bit easier.<br>  <br>  Also, after you get past that you should then take the initiative to talk to him. Yes I know that this CAN get frustrating because you don’t want to be the only brave one right? But well, just as I said think of this as practice. <br>  <br>  Besides, it seems like you’re pretty sure he likes you back so might as well try to do something about it right?<br>  <br>  Don’t worry about it too much and just see how it plays out., just be yourself and put my suggestions into practice :]<br>  <br>  Anyways I wish you all the good luck and hope this helped!|`|NkcNlFgzaa	honestly, if you're interested in a guy, it's good to know how he operates. If he is the kind of guy to make moves, then let HIM do the work if you're not comfortable with it. However, these kinds of guys also find it very attractive if the woman makes some moves and has confidence. If he is kind of shy like you, then take some initiative and tell him how you feel.|`|IT8NDcgpaa	I run into the same problem on the opposite spectrum. Most people nowadays want to talk (texting, aim, phone) and that is the foundation for their relationship. The easiest way to show someone that you like them is just be there to listen and be conversational when you need to be. <br>  <br>  Other physical ways to show a guy you like him is to reach for his hand when the moment is right, give him an extra long hug or whisper in his ear from time to time.<br>  <br>  Secrets build trust and trust builds relationships.|`|Y8dXwds5aa	breathe first start getting confidence it will help your shyness use him as confidence booster body language look int o his eyes then shoot him a smile once in a while if he is standing then get beside him and get close so he can feel you it will make him nervous  flip your hair  drop something in front of him and see if he picks it up or see if he helps you pick it up that will make a good conversation starter don't be nervous because he is probably more nervous and shy than you good luck|`|rECJjqzWaa	you know how to, you just dont know how to stop being an oddball. first off, you need to calm down and not freak out around guys. you really should go for it, if it doesnt work out then oh well everyone has those bad experiences but the only way to get over this problem is to practice and learn from your mistake.<br>  <br>  if you have trouble talking to him, or responding to a conversation hes starting, slow down, think, and then answer. dont just spit out anything that pops in your head.<br>  <br>  good luck, it will get better.|`|Rf65wT1Xaa	well you should just talk to him. that would show him that you want to get to know him. then after you start to talk then ask him what is he doing that night if he says he does not have plans then ask him if he would like to hang out. he would get the clue. remember that you can't  make someone like you tho, so do not be to pushy. but i really think u will do fine. good luck and let me know how it goes thanks.|`|NECU1hSWaa	Ignore the first comment. He's an idiot.<br>  <br>  Yeah, well... I don't know if it will help but I usually follow them around all week until he turns around + asks why i'm following him lmao... but that's me... + I just laugh + smile at him all the time. I guess it's kind'f annoying for him, but that's kind'f my way of saying 'I love you'.<br>  <br>  XD|`|b5c040dbcc3a903f4e1f664f5535b466aa	Just tell him you like him. That's properly the only way to get past that. He won't know you like him because you are to afraid to show him and let him know. Just start talking to him and hanging around him more. Sooner or later he will get the hint.  Best of luck.|`|83YSCi4Faa	I think your putting wayyyyy too much effort into this, try your own advice, be yourself. Don't think about what to say just say it, and if it sounds a little stupid, don't worry about it, you were only being yourself and thats all someone can ask for.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	you're kidding right<br>  whisper in his ear how much youlike him and what you would be willing to do for him<br>  unless he is gay or does not speak english (LMAO) he will understand immediately|`|cBtFp2aYaa	give him the look some cleavage or sumting tell him|`|1KKXD1tMaa	look at him in the eyes and smile and laugh when u see him maybge tease him a little like play with his hair grab his butt|`|qes0WiI6aa	start out by asking the guy question ok i we need more help let me know ok|`|X21hOJvtaa	Then just text him and say i like you too.|`|F7DxOnJkaa	ask him for help on things be friendly with him and say you like this one guy dont say him and im sure hell say o yea really? describe him but not so obivious you know? just throw him little hints at a time you dont have to over do it in one go lol be friends with him say hi deny to your self that you like him for now and say to yourself hes just a friend and just talk to him and youll know when the time is right to actually let him know if he doesnt already get it that you do hey for all you know hes probably about as shy as you and dont want to ask you cause hes afraid hell get turned down show him that you wont turn him down. just say **** it and go for it but dont over do it im not sure if i helped you out i hope i did i believe you can do it if i can you can i got over my shyness and asked my gf out lol where doing great actually so just go for it its the best advice i can really give you|`|tpFTpTWCaa	I was the same way when I was in highschool. I was really shy. I did the same thing as you. Infact there was this guy who walked by me once and said "Hey!!! Smile :) " and I did...and he said "There you go." Just a random guy. <br>  You can always stick a note in his locker if you are still in hs...Uhm. I would somehow meet his friends...maybe start talking to a girl friend of his and ease your way in. That's all hs stuff. I don't know what I would do...I have gained a lot of confidence since then and I am married now. It's so easy to meet guys that are good looking/nice/crush...whatever... You can talk on the internet and get to know eachother that way, then ususally he'll ask you out to dinner or movies or to hang out sometime.

But don't you think that is a shallow way to a approach a marriage? The ceremony is supposed to be about family and close friends watching you affirm your love and commitment.

Then we had the reception in a renovated barn.  We hired a band and had a great party with all our family and friends.

AA11124885	Something similar actually happened to my younger bro when we were kids.  A neighbor accused him of inappropriate contact with a younger child.  Parents got together and "talked" and both kids were questioned by parents.  It turned out that the accusing child was just attention seeking and (much) later actually came to us and apologized.  You should always take kids seriously when they say they have been abused, but keep in mind, they are just kids and don't always understand the consequences of what they claim.  (We knew the truth pretty much already, because the time the event supposedly occurred, we were away at church camp all week.)|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	This is serous and can destroy your son.<br>    It is common for children to experiment but if the authority's get involved all bets are off.<br>  <br>   If you are good friends with the mother go to her and humbly ask about her  daughter and how she would like you to Proceed in this manner.<br>    Your son may need to see a therapist too.<br>   Good luck with this as your son is in terrible trouble|`|7ko9czaaaa	make very sure that it is true then get him some help,|`|BO28Mn8haa	come from your son? you mean the rumor? wow that's tough, go to the parents with him and talk to them|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Get the truth, get counseling , get him a chastity belt.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Where did it come from then? you need to talk to your son and find out how this started.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	You need to sort this out, find out if there is any truth to it. If not you need have a serious talk with whomever it is coming from as this sort of thing can be very damaging and follow your child for years to come. If there is some truth to it, there are two very important things you must do. First, talk to the parents of the other child and find out what their position is, try to settle out of court, practice damage control. Second, get your child into therapy stat! If your child is oversexed or exhibiting predatory behavior at such a young age there is a chance that he was sexually abused himself. Good luck.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Really need more information to answer, such as who is accusing him? the girl? her parents? where they ever alone or in a situation where sex could've occurred?<br>  <br>  <br>   Talk to your son. He is 13, he KNOWS about sex in some fashion, as to if he knows FACTS is a different thing entirely.  But you need to know the truth. <br>  (my first issue with this is that your 13 year old son has a 7 year old friend (girl I assume)... my son(14) doesn't even acknowledge my daughters friends unless he is yelling at them to get away from him and they are 9-11 year olds. <br>  My advice is to get the facts, get a lawyer (if needed) talk to the parents of the girl, get to the bottom of it.|`|ckd18jUMaa	You will need to first of all get the truth right away. Don't delay this, do it now as we speak, because you will also need to find your son a lawyer and a child psychologist, NOW!<br>  <br>  ... and good luck with it!!<br>  <br>  p.s. just don't make him feel like a freak or anything, at his age it's only fair that he is curious. It is important that you get him the right counseling all the way through this, regardless of the whole thing being true or not, cos you don't want him to develop issues regarding sex!! If that's true than you have to talk to him about sex, answer all of his questions, and get him the best counseling you can!!<br>  <br>  ... oh and just in case don't forget about the lawyer!!!|`|6dhEB2nBaa	I didnt even know what sex was at 13!

If it is I would find a child psychologist.|`|RnHDnSgPaa	wow i wish you luck!! kids can be crazy..<br>  <br>  just remember hes still young and you know what<br>  <br>  when your young you still dont know right from wrong he proably was just experimenting!|`|RkNIs0rSaa	wow.  better get your son an attorney.|`|rkFVxFb4aa	OMG this is sick|`|fAdh5BAkaa	someone maybe did it to him|`|U4AeZ41Raa	Who's accusing?  Do they have something like a sperm sample from this girl?  If they do, test it against your son (sounds traumatizing for both at such a young age, but if it's already been taken from the girl, you can probably mask what you're doing to your son.)<br>  <br>  Otherwise, try to see if they have any proof other than her word, and kids around that age are still pretty impressionable -- with the right questioning adults can get them to say/remember things that didn't actually happen.  Make sure no one is trying to manipulate the situation.<br>  <br>  Also, talk to your son and make sure he's not lying to you, emphasize to him what a big deal it is to make sure, but stay calm and nice.|`|W0633l18aa	wow, first thing first:<br>  <br>  talk to your son, try and work out the truth of the matter<br>  <br>  talk to the person who accused him and what evidence they based it on<br>  <br>  talk to the other boys parents and discuss what action should be taken depending on whether it is true or not<br>  <br>  stop your son from socialising with the other boy<br>  <br>  if it is true put your son into counseling, maybe move away, try a fresh start.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do right now is take a deep breath, stop panicking and take it step by step. Talk to your son, try and find out the truth, if your osn has any siblings talk to them and if the accusation is coming form the police get a lawyer<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|hFQuv7mIaa	have a talk with your son and ask him whether he did do it and tell him that if he doesn't tell you the truth, you can't defend or help him. If he says no, leave it lie and if anyone mentions it to you or you hear anyone metioning it, put them straight and tell them and if he did do it, ask him for details (when and where) and try and talk to the girl's parents and be stern but understanding so he knows that your on his side. Still try and defend him, no matter what the outcome is. If it is true, just tell everyone that it is a rumor because they don't need to know your son's personal business! They will never know that it did actually happen, will they?!<br>  <br>  Good Luck with it!|`|l6LUNx9yaa	Remember that first, it is an accusation.  You need to find out if there is any truth to it at all. Sit down with your son in a comfortable and calm manner, and ask him.  Don't blame or accuse yourself, just simply ask.  Questions like, "Did you and your friend, (name), experiment a little bit together concerning your gender differences?"   "Have you and (name) ever done anything that you've perhaps seen other people do in movies or perhaps they told you about in school?" (Remember, sex education in school is starting early now. My school told us in the 5th grade, sadly.)  <br>  <br>  If your son hints or says yes to these questions, tell him you need to know (again, calmly) exactly what he and his friend did. If he denys it all, then you'll have to reinforce it to your son that it is imperative that you know. This is important. Speak with the parents of the 7 year old, even if they are the ones accusing, and ask them why they think your son did this-whether or not your son denys or confirms.  If they say that the 7 year old told them, ask if they had the child checked over by a medical doctor. If they haven't, request that they do. <br>  <br>  If there are any grounds to the accusations, you'll need to call your family lawyer and inquire as to what the next steps are. A child psychologist will probably be required, and make the family of the other child sign a contract of matter stating that this is to be kept out of the media. The issue at hand will be traumatic enough without it being dragged through the papers. <br>  <br>  Whether or not this occured, you'll have to be supportive of your son. Let him know you still love him, and that everyone makes mistakes. If he has done it, tell him why it was inappropraite and what's going to happen because of his actions. His life may take on some negative events due to this, and it's important that you help him through it. <br>  <br>  My thoughts and prayers are with you.|`|DUq74Xr7aa	Well first you need to sit your boy down and talk to him. Be kind but concerned. Try to find out exactly what happened, If he denies it happened you need to decide for yourself if he's lying or not. <br>  <br>  There's a big difference from a 7 year old and 13 year old, however,  your son is just a boy himself who probably wouldn't have know what he was doing. Don't be mad at him.<br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about until the police start getting involved. He's just a minor, obviously, and made a stupid mistake! If the courts get involved I'm sure they'll understand this. Just relax!<br>  <br>  ....kids these days... /sigh|`|6D8BI1ffaa	Call a lawyer pronto!|`|vUp7BMtMaa	you sit your son down and make him talk about it with you.<br>  :)
aSoCKVJ3aa	Just tell him how you feel.  Pour your heart out to him.  Remind him of the good times you've had. List them in the order that they happened and tell him how you felt at the time. Don't bring up bad stuff.<br>  For example..The first time I saw you, I felt a stirring in my heart that I had never felt before. Good Luck :)|`|eeGN977eaa	It depends why he is in jail.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	Guys in jail don't tend to like lovey letters. Send him a positive letter, or if you're feeling frisky write him a filthy story.

Perhaps going on a date with your husband during which you put on some sultry clothes and play with him teasingly at the restaurant insinuating you would like to be physical.  You may even try going back to high school tactics and having him drive you to a secluded spot...give him oral sex and being pantiless slip on him when you have him full erect.  If that doesn't get his attention...you may be past the point of no return.  Good Luck|`|BgmA2r5Eaa	Try having sex in unexpected places or watch some hard-cor porn while doing it.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	It's time to ramp up the roll playing, maybe taking it to a higher level and dressing the part.

So let your imagination go wild and you will suddenly find that your bedroom has become a hot and spicy place in which all sorts of fun takes place.  Good luck.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Watch porn or buy some books.

Stop sleeping with him. let him go. <br>  Dont allow him to treat you like this, he wanted out, let him out stop letting him come back just for the goodies.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Maybe if you understand the word divorce, it will help you.   When a person divorces it means he wants nothing that has to do with love with the person he/she is divorcing.   Sleeping with that person after the divorce means he/she is satisfying sexual desire only, just like you do when you pay a hooker, the only difference with an ex is that is free.   The phrase used when confronted about this truth is "I am confused".  And what this phrase means is "get it through your head its over, I don't want to hurt you, but I am getting someone else who I really care about".   I know this sounds cruel, but you need to get over it and move on.   What he is doing to you is very cruel|`|3YzXWHwbaa	I know, you can't live with him, you can't live without him.<br>  It is sadly, the time to let him go for real and get on with your life.

Bueno el caso es que durante catorce a?os lo he visto todos los veranos en el  mes de agosto y te puedo decir que no se lo que siente una madre pero lo que yo siento no es rencor, ES ASCO, REPUGNANCIA, es una sensacion de muy rara, el a?o pasado murieron mis abuelos y lo tube que enfrentar de frente a pocos metros uno en frente del otro y lo que siento es asco, pero ahora me armo de valor y su presencia ya no me hace da?o hoy en dia tengo fuerzas y si alguien tiene que bajar la cabeza es él.<br>  <br>  Mira mi familia lo sabe toda y su mujer dice que es mentira, claro que va a decir, pero es algo que al principio le daba importancia hoy en día me da igual que me crean o no por que lo que tengo muy claro es que Dios pone a cada persona en su sitio y yo estoy esperando, mientras esté viva tengo toda la vida y muerta toda la eternidad.

Even if you aren't, just make out that you're still happy and maybe occasionally tell him that some guy was giving you the eye that day. Doesn't have to be true, but when I do it, my ex gets really jealous. I'm sorry to say there's not a lot else you can do.

dlG9IaISaa	There is nothing wrong with that, go for it girl. Then maybe you are use to yelling your ex's name when he tikkled you so now you don't have to worry about when the new guy tikkles you shouting out the wrong the name. I thing it is just lucky to have a guy with the same name as your ex.|`|MO3i51Fmaa	No - go for it!<br>  At least you'll never have to worry about who's name you call out when you are dreaming!!!!|`|rwHvsbEAaa	well..some people said that love is blind..just go with that 'someone' if u really like him or her.name shouldnt be a matter at all...many people got the same name what?if that person got the same name as ur ex,it doesnt mean that he or she have the same attitude as him or her...|`|de75c6103d62d8807f85d1c1ab0c7cf6aa	It definitely is weird if your ex boyfriend and present boyfriend have the same name...too many associations with the name and the person. But, it is not fair to refuse someone just because they have the same name as your ex! Both guys couldn't determine their own names, and it's not their faults for being named that, nor should the present guy be penalized for that. You can always call the other one by a nickname if the exact same name weirds you out. Give him a chance! Wouldn't it suck for you so bad if a guy you liked wouldn't date him because your name was the same as your ex?|`|TH3Pd5Y1aa	No.i wud not......
PZRhGRtzaa	Guys are dumb that way. Some like guys like hair styles one way and others are up for changes.

Qh9SjcuYaa	well,i dont think he changed,with the trash talking<br>  and who cares if ur e is a better kisser,its about more than that.<br>  if u love ur bf that ur with now stay w/ him,choose who u love more.<br>  <br>  <br>  what did ur ex do to u,as in "hurt"?|`|fotfHo7Aaa	sorry. he probably hasnt changed..|`|M55et6t1aa	Your ex wants you back because he cannot stand it that you have moved on with your life.<br>  <br>  Its the old...."I don't want you, till someone else has you"<br>  <br>  His life is miserable, and he thinks yours should be as well.<br>  <br>  The Rat|`|M192Qqpzaa	try giving ur ex another chance if you want to because myb he DID change.. if you like ur current bf, stay with him. plain and simple.|`|OPeHln9Taa	You have your answer, to make it easy -just cut off any interaction with him. If you know he works at the local supermarket then go to one that is a little further away. And no it is not because he still likes you, it's because he doesn't want you with anyone else which is totally different.

Te contaré algo que se seguro te será útil, seguro tienes algún problema.<br>  Mis padres son totalmente homofóbicos. Desde peque?a, me hicieron creer que es algo repugnante y que no son seres humanos. Me lo inculcaban poque tenían en cuenta que compartí tiempo con mi prima (que es lesviana) cuando tenía 5 a?os, ella en ese entonces 10. Trés a?os más tarde la familia se desunió ya que mi prima escapó de su casa diciendo que no aceptaban su opción sexual. Cuando mis padres se enteraron de esto y estaban concientes que compartí tiempo con ella, me empezaron a meter ideas a mis 9 a?os de edad. Sin embargo, yo ya había visto pornografía de todos los tipos con todos los sexos a esa edad (tengo un hermano 4 a?os mayor, ustedes entenderan) y la verdad tenía una idea transtornada de qué era la homosexualidad. Yo empecé mi vida sexual a los 11 a?os, ya tenía novios de 14 y 15, y no tenía amigas de mi edad (Perdí la virginidad a los 13 a?os) siempre fui una chica muy precoz, pero ahora esta generacion, creo que esto ya esta normal. Y quién diría, que todo lo que me inculcaron mis padres se volcó a mis 12 a?os. Tenía una mejor amiga, que hace 2 meses ya no lo es (foolle con su novio jajaj) asi que la llamare X. Parábamos juntas para todos lados, y a mis padres les gustaba mucho esta chica, ya que era la de las mejores calificaciones. Siempre nos quedábamos a dormir una en la casa de la otra y siempre eran risas y hablabamos de chicos, ella era bastante movidita tambien. Un día, ella se quedo en mi casa y vimos una pelicula de terror, que daba bastante miedo, era bastante sangrienta.. con toda nuestra inocencia nos abrazamos al escuchar el grito de esa mujer que el sangraba la nariz (en la pelicula) ambas nos miramos y sentimos algo fuera de lo comun. No estabamos en la cama, sino en la alfombra. Ella me mira y me empuja suavemente hacia el suelo hasta yo quedar echada. Ella encima de mi me da un besito inocente y se aleja. Sin embargo, yo no me conforme y la agarre en brazos y le di un beso sumamente salvaje, a mis cortos 12 a?os de edad. Empezamos a sobarnos, a tocarnos nuestras partecitas intimas hasta quedar agotadas, y quedarnos dormidas en el suelo. Al día siguiente ella ya no estaba y me dejo una notita que decía "Siempre serás mi mejor amiga, pero algunas veces, como ayer, serás algo más". La verdad no me lo podía creer, porque nunca me imagine besarme con una chica (al menos en una orgia) a solas, y mucho menos X, mi mejor amiga. Desde ese momento me di cuenta que me gustaban las chicas y los chicos, y seguía siendo humana, y no tuve lo culpa de lo que pasó. Nacíó de mi cuerpo, de muy dentro de mí.<br>  Sin embargo, jamas lo haré público.. tomando en cuenta todos los perjucios que se pueden tener hacia los homosexuales, incluidos mis padres.<br>  Talvez esta historia te paresca incrédula, pero no es la única. Siempre fui diferente a todas mis amiguitas, y no hacia un lado bueno.<br>  No discriminen a los homosexuales, que seguimos siendo humanos. Espero que te sea útil. Y una cosa más: El sexo es increíble.|`|373536ea0e9aa4cfd1684d46dfb223ecaa	Es algo natural en algunas chicas, a veces no se sienten atraidas hacia hombres y ven atractivas a las chicas lo cual no tiene nada de malo, yo soy heterosexual pero no tengo nada encontra de las lesbianas!!|`|8lkKMzB4aa	bueno, me parece q el "lesbianismo" (jeje) es simplemente una tendencia sexual con la cual una mujer puede crecer, desgraciadamente por todos los estatutos sociales es mal vista como una practica indebida, ademas de que los medios hacen su trabajo, esto en la medida q en las peliculas, series de tv y demas, las malas, las poco eticas y todas las peores mujeres q haya en los medios tienen tendencias lesbicas, tal vez soy demasiado liberal en mi modo de pensar, pero creo que esto es algo natural, aunque no bien visto, saluditos|`|QS3BNFVDaa	No lo critico.... pero tampoco lo comparto...No hay nada mejor que los hombres...!!! <br>  <br>  Te hacen Vibrar.!!!<br>  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....|`|UdrRNpbZaa	Cuando era heterosexual y me dí cuenta de que con los hombres se sufría mucho al mismo tiempo de que también me atraían las mujeres, me quedé con ellas porque en un principio me sentía mucho mejor tratada...Hoy en día y con bastantes a?os de lesbiana (como 20) me doy cuenta de que de este lado se sufre más porque se siente más... Aún así nunca más he vuelto a estar con un hombre, desde entonces... Y no me arrepiento de ello.
8lkKMzB4aa	ah ver muchacho dejame poner las cosas en claro, a menos que vivan dentro de un estereo, que vivan en un automovil, que sean mudos y que la unica manera de comunicarse sea a traves de musica ó que simplemente la busques para hablar de que metallica va a estar con iron maiden tocando contra eminem en el foro sol (DF), no hay razon para que las cosas no funcionen, pensemos que como pareja van a hacer muchas cosas, tal vez algun dia quieran ir a un concierto y a alguno de los 2 no les gustara, para eso estan los amigos, pero la chava que te gusta no es nada mas para que oigan musica si la vida girara en torno a la musica y todas las relaciones fueran hechas en base a lo q se escucha en el estereo, todo estaria acabado, digo, no por nada yo (ferviente escucha de rock alternativo e indie) ando con mi novia (q no sale de su chayanne y todo eso), deja de pensar como otto de los simpson y piensa como...

81f0f13134d2e26915f7776b66103c9eaa	I think you like the attention.  Especially, since your in a failing relationship.  He knows about your relationship failing and is trying to get you to bite.  I find it odd, he does not contact you outside of work.  I have a feeling he is in a relationship himself and has not clued you in on it.  Sounds like this guy has his own cake, but wants a nibble from your cake as well.  You just think he is great because your looking for the bright side of your current relationship failing.  Unfortunately, it sounds like this guy is preying on someone, he knows who is vulnerable with her feelings.  I would watch yourself.  I think  your being to vulnerable and need to completely end your current relationship honestly instead of using this guy as an excuse.  This guy has no interest in you.  He is taking advantage of your vulnerability and he is getting all your attention.  Funny?  He is not calling you.  You will get burnt in the end.  End the failing relationship your are in if its a must. This guy at work tho, is not right for you either.  Just my thoughts.|`|2Q6Emf7Zaa	i don't understand the problem. seems like he likes you so go for it! =]]|`|mFjuQDL3aa	You guys obviously like each other. Now that you know he likes you back, it's okay for you to make the move. So do it! Don't be shy and don't be afraid to ask him out. Don't hesitate at all. Just be straightforward. You never know, he's probably dying to ask you out deep inside. Might as well make the move.

LOs recuerdos solo los trae uno en el alma! =)|`|GspunsUraa	pues depende que tan utilme resulte, si es ropa y me gussta calro qeu la seguire usando, si es un disco o unapelicula la seguire veindo,  u oyendo, no veoo motivo para no usar algo qeu te gusta y que realmente usas, si por ejemplo es una playera que no me gusta no tengo por qeu usarla ande o no ande con ella, se supone que caudo te ahcen un regalo lo ahcen con buena intencion, y si cuando me dio el regalo la relacion era buena, peus supongo si lo conservaria por ese mero recuerdo a algo que valio lapena en un moomento muy especifico, si pr el contrario el regalo me trajera maslos recuerdos, del momento en el que me lo dieron, pues en esa caso tal vez me desaria de el, pero en general no veo por que desacerce o no usar algo qeu te dieron con un beun motivo en un beu momento, a lo mejor la relacion ermino mal, fue una ruptura de corazon, un golpe al ego o que se yo, pero a final de cuentas el objeto yo lo voy a asociar con ese mal recuerdo, o bine lo peudo asociar con el beun recuerdo en el que me lo dieron, cabe mencioanr que mi postura no es muy logica, ya qeu solo hablo en teoria ya que las mujeres no me reglanan nada snif snif, o solo me regalan consumibles, es decir me invitan a comer, o e regalan un vino, ocas qeu no son duraderas, o me regalaan frases, es decir cosas que escriben, para mi eso en todo caso tiene mas valor, or que realmente me trae un recuerdo o un pensamiento, y no solo es la asociacio de un receurdo a un objeto, por lo tnato ese es mi punto, el objeto no implica recuerdos ni buenos ni malos, nosotros le  atribuimos valor y peso a dichos obbjetos, y de nosostros depende si lo asociamos con el mal momento final, o con el grato moento en el quelo recibimos, y eso dictara nuestra pstura hacia dicho objeto, pero eso es una cuestio muy personal, solo cada quein bajo sus situaciones y emotividad podra decidir qeu ahce y que postura tomar<br>  suerte|`|eshOeInoaa	La verdad que sí lo seguiría usando, porqué tendría que dejarlo de usar, si terminé en buenas con mi ex no tengo porque agarrar enojo con las cosas que me regaló.|`|AXCFCnHSaa	ps si es una chavo equis me da igual ademas lo presumo jajaja como el regalo del sonsis... si era importante ps si duele pero lo dado dado eh!<br>   y si vale empe~alo !<br>  <br>  <br>  ayuda<a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjLhPkqNyMAn8OW1b4yCb7KY8gt.?qid=20070807225337AATAyUL">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|XtPr8Nl6aa	pues todo depende de que tan intensa fue la relacion la neta si te recuerda mucho a ella y sientes feo de que ya no esta contigo mejor guardalo y ya no te digo que lo deseches por que los recuerdos son como tesoros pero si simplemente la recuerdas con cari?o usa lo que te dio y cuidalo para que se te valla a a perder|`|bc4b79893e9da42fbc3db58d3a1aec80aa	no le veo ningun problema , solo que  porfavor no suspires cada vez que veas pasar un minuto.|`|c8e6e3f5e0db6e10b7c2d55b216b1d0faa	El uzar o no algo que tu ex te dio, es algo x, lo que importa es lo que tu cientes, si te afecta no lo uzes, guardalo en un lugar muy especial y ya, pero si no te afecta y lo quieres uzar ya es tu opcion, lo que pienso es que lo que paso, ya paso, lo que ya no fue, para que vivirlo recordando, mas adelante vive gente y en casas de material dice un dicho.|`|oolawTPmaa	SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII,?que tiene que ver?.

lBm7fAKdaa	Ummmhhh....devo comenzar dicientote que la masturbacion es una practica normalisima tanto en hombres como mujeres. Yo particularmente la disfruto plenamente, ya sea sola a acompanada de mi esposo, y lo hago todas las veses que siento el deseo y la necesidad, inclusive interrumpo el acto sexual y le pido a mi esposo para masturbarnos al mismo tiempo mientras el me mira y yo lo miro a el, y despues volvemos a las penetraciones..que rico...como te dije lo hago con cierta frecuencia, y si, me satisface terriblemente y la seguire practicando...|`|4Gjh35c5aa	Las mujeres, como nosotros, tienen las mismas necesidades físicas, por lo tanto, se masturban y tienen deseos igual que los hombres.<br>  <br>  Pero eso no es un descubrimiento. Hoy en día es de dominio público que usan vibradores, bolas chinas, el dedito, etc... ello nos lleva a la conclusión que les satisface... igual que a nosotros.<br>  <br>  Sobre la frecuencia, pues imagino que también depende del deseo sexual de cada una.<br>  <br>  Un saludo.<br>  José Ramón<br>  "Ingresos mensuales.

Solo pelea por tu amor, hablale cuando la tengas frente a ti, dile que estas arrepentido de haberla dejado de no haberle dado el valor que se merecía es decir, no atenderla, pero que la sigues amando con todas tus fuerzas. Que se den los dos otra  oportunidad, que el tiempo te sirvió para darte cuenta de cuanto la amabas y cuanta falta te hace.<br>  <br>  Y que ella no debió estar con otro en tu ausencia si de verdad ella te amaba pero que a pesar de eso, tu la disculpas.

Como verás puedes subir de nivel rapido.<br>  <br>  También te aconsejo que acá encontraras todo tipo de personas, de diferentes clases, cultura, edades, etc. y por ende encontraras algunas respuestas ofensivas como otras no, y esto te lo digo para que no te sorprendas y vayas viendo como es el manejo de YR jejej pero es asi.<br>  <br>  Nuevamente te deseo la mayor de las suertes y que apliques tus conocimientos y llegues al nivel que desees.<br>  <br>  Ah y ponte un avatar es decir tu imagen para que te identifiques.<br>  <br>  Suerte y besitos. Y TE ENVíO TU PRIMERA ESTRELLITA, esas de verdad te las dan cuando realizas alguna pregunta y les gusta a los participantes, las vas acumulando, pero de verdad no se para que sirven jejeje.|`|8i8vJlGeaa	Bien pues ya tienes una información completa simplemente para darte la bienvenida y adelante.<br>  Suerte.|`|JcS4NguAaa	como ya tienes suficiente informacion te dare la bienvenida,suerte y q lo pases bien!|`|Nq28IawRaa	Los puntos te sirven para subir de nivel....pero creo que lo mas interesante no es eso es el echo de dar consejos a los que lo necesitan......a mi en lo personal me sirve de mucha distraccion... y alimento mis conocimientos.......y rio de algunas preguntas o respuestas graciosas aveces hasta groseras pero bueno .......asi es la gente......|`|O3ij1C8xaa	primero que nada,bienvenida!!!!!!<br>  veo que ya te dieron informacion sobre como obtener puntos (que en lo personal no me sirven de nada).<br>  mis primeros dias aqui si me interesaba conseguir muchos puntos,pero con el tiempo lo que mas me interesa es conocer personas,y lo estoy logrando con mucho exito,sabes? no conozco a muchas personas la verdad solo algunas son con las que mantengo mucho contacto,pero he encontrado aqui a gente maravillosa,que me hacen pasar lindos momentos,que me animan cuando ando triste,en fin buenos amigos.<br>  espero que te guste el foro y que te quedes un buen rato aqui<br>  y que hagas muchas pero muchas amistades.|`|e6104d6cfc6a57134c2deb916f0d67f4aa	Hola, bienvenida y grax x acercarte!!! Bueno, x ejemplo yo ya tengo 45 a?os así que ya estoy "betabel" para estas andanzas, pero entré por motivos muy personales y cuando me aburro de ver las mismas preguntas repetirse, o me censuran los inquisidores de Y!R, me retiro un tiempo...<br>  <br>  Entra a las preguntas donde tengas algo que decir o te guste el tema, a veces puedes bromear pero siempre intenta que vaya de acuerdo a lo que pregunten y por cierto, no abundes demasiado profundo en tópicos espinosos como el sexo pues hay ni?as y ni?os acá (!) ni tampoco ofendas como suelen hacer muchos chavos (las mujeres son mucho más respetuosas aquí) por no estar de acuerdo con ciertas ideas (religión, política, chovinismos, etc.), ni te extiendas demasiado para que no caigas en sospecha de las reglas de la comunidad y así no van a eliminar tus preguntas, Responde mucho y pregunta poco, siempre que puedas incluye los libros o sitios en red que inspiran algunas de tus palabras y trata de divertirte, en vez de enojarte, hay cuates bastante cultos y nenas muy sensibles que, de cuando en cuando, te ayudan (como a mí) con sus pensamientos. Sí, puedes dirigir tus cuestiones al género que gustes (lo más común, "chicos, contesten..." o "sólo para mujeres"), pero igual a adolescentes (nunca faltará quién conteste). A menos que haya polémica y sea una pregunta para expertos en la materia (filosofía, ciencias,psicología), en general interesa más la trivia (artistas, relaciones de amor, amistad, etc.), no te devanes los sesos preguntando, tienes buena ortografía así que sé clara en tus ideas, desarrollálas brevemente,<br>  Los puntos, er... ?para qué sirven? A mí para estar en este nivel pues no importa ser un "destacado". Y!R es un medio precioso para no perderle sentido a la vida... Ah!, lee las normas y no des así porque sí tu teléfono a nadie... Suerte!|`|9tirX1B7aa	Te dieron algunos puntos, asi es que cada vez que preguntas te quitan 5 puntos y cada vez que respondes te dan dos, y si tu respuesta es seleccionada como la mejor te dan diez puntos, al ir acumulando puntos tendras la ventaja de subir de nivel y cada vez que subes de nivel puedes contestar mas preguntas y hacer mas.  trata de responder para acumular puntos, asi puedes preguntar mas, y cuando hagas una pregunta la ubicas segun la categoria, no tiene nada que ver con la edad.  Mucha suerte y bienvenida.|`|CPCbIQtAaa	?BIENVENIDA AL FORO! <br>  Cada pregunta que respondas recibes 2 puntos y si es elegida como mejor respuesta te dan 10 puntos. <br>  Cada día que ingresas a esta página recibes un punto.<br>  Puedes sumar un punto también votando por las preguntas que aún no tienen seleccionada la mejor respuesta.<br>  Te restan 5 puntos por cada pregunta que hagas.<br>  Las preguntas son abiertas y las puede responder cualquiera que lo desee...<br>  La suma de todos los puntos te permite ir pasando de niveles. No existe remuneración alguna, sin embargo es adictivo. Cuando empiezas no quieres salir... te sientes útil y puedes salvar dudas que tú misma tienes viendo las preguntas y respuestas de los otros miembros.<br>  Saludos y suerte. Te espero... yo estoy en el 2do piso, digo... nivel|`|CqWZdqT2aa	Mira los puntos no te sirven lamentablemente para nada solo para presumirlos y puedes hacer tu pregunta que quieras solo te ubicas en la categoria y listo pero ten en cuenta que cada pregunta te cuesta cinco puntos cuidate.|`|JOwbHEb1aa	Como todo el mundo te ha informado estupendamente,sólo me queda darte la Bienvenida.<br>  Un saludo|`|eLDGaIHMaa	una vez al di a cuando entras te regalan un punto<br>  pregunta ke respondes +2<br>  pregunta ke haces -5<br>  si la pregunta ke repondiste s elegida como la mejor +10  y asi subes  a niveles mmmm  responde mas y pregunta menos

Aqui importa mucho qué es lo que sientes, porque tampoco es justo para los dos que tengan ese tipo de intimidad si no hay un compromiso, piensalo por tu felicidad y la de él.<br>  Saludos!|`|IlQHKnT6aa	ven y yo te lo digo pero sobre mi cama

JfeLb2Ptaa	I can tell you, if my husband had done something like that, i don't think I could ever trust him again. In the back of my mind, I would always have a nagging feeling. <br>  In your situation though, you two have been together for 20 years. That is a really long time. It is going to be hard to forgive him, but it is definitely worth a shot. It does seem a little hard to believe that they didn't have sex, but you need to start trusting what he is saying at some point. I don't know the situation of the affair or what your husband is saying, but it is up to you to see the honesty in him because you know him better than anybody. <br>  <br>  Definitely take a few days to yourself. You need some space. And then you two should go and see a couples therapist. It will help you two talk openly about what happened in a controlled environment, so if you start to get angry, the therapist can help you calm down before you murder your husband. <br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck with all this. Many couples go through it and survive. If your husband has been faithful the last 20 years and just had this one blip, you still got yourself a good guy. He's human.|`|bVROvLNSaa	It takes a long time, a really long time - YEARS in fact.<br>  <br>  You have to decide that you love him, and that you are going to stay with him and keep that foremost in your mind.  As an earlier poster said, do not dwell on this; put it behind you.<br>  <br>  Think about your future together, let him know that he will have to earn your trust again and that will not be easy for you.<br>  <br>  The organization below can help you with this.|`|AA12198711	6 weeks and it never led to anything? What else are you allowing him to tell you and be gullible enough to listen to? Seriously, think about it dear. 6 weeks, an affair, is ample time to have progressed to more than just coffee. <br>  <br>  Be angry. But do it so it does not affect you as much as him.<br>  <br>  Never let your guard down again and let him know you will always have it up.|`|0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Just give it time... that's the only thing you can do.  There's no miracle that's going to just 'fix' it.  The pain will never COMPLETELY go away.   Not sure you made the right decision by staying with him.  I just find it hard to believe he didn't sleep with her in 6 weeks...  but it's your life and you gotta live it.  Just beware...|`|5A7RmIH6aa	your a idiot. really.<br>  <br>  its divorce time. what makes you think that will never happen again? you always want to be laughed at when they talk about you? he is just kissing your butt because you found out. im sorry,a real marriage dosent work like that|`|XlhBBZPxaa	maybe couseling will help your marriage sometimes talking to someone else about your problems does help a LOT|`|62gMbgb1aa	you did the right thing till now.. just be sure that if each couples divorce because one of them has made a mistake there will be no married person anymore. i am not saying that we should accept our partner to cheat, but i am saying that we should give another chance if we know that our partner deserve it.. you know him, you know if it is worth or not, you know if he will do it again or not, you know if he really regret it or not, you are the only one who knows if he deserve this chance or not, some pple learn from their mistake, others dont.<br>  now concerning how you wanna get over it, trust me you cannot do it alone, i know how does it feel having these 2 opposite persons inside you, but your husband and the way he act know and the way he deals with the situation will decide which of these two persons to remain, now it is his role, he can either make it up for you and make you forget how stupid he was when he cheated you, then am sure u will forget, or he will just continue and dont make any effort as if nothing happened then you will never get over it.<br>  good luck|`|IkymPOHraa	Dont stay with him if he cheated on you before and lied about it... what makes you think he isnt lying when he says nothing really happened between them|`|AA11803994	The fact is, he had an affair and whether it was emotional or physical, it doesn't matter. It's the fact that he lied to you and cheated on you. You have every right to be angry and sad and hurt. What you are feeling is normal. I really commend you for staying with him and wanting to work things out and the fact that he is sorry and wants to work it out as well is a great sign.<br>  <br>  He slipped up-he made a mistake-but the trust you had in him won't ever be the same now. So, the question is, how do you get beyond what happened?<br>  <br>  First, let me tell you that it takes time, but wanting to make your marriage last is the right choice. You probably feel like your relationship with him is on life-support ;) but you just need a few resources to keep it alive and eventually moving right along on its own. <br>  <br>  I discovered after three years of marriage that my husband had an internet porn addiction. I felt sad and betrayed and angry but I also felt like you...I wanted to make it work. He had never physically cheated but the fact that he had been looking at other women made me feel inadequate for him even though he told me over and over that I was beautiful. He just never realized how his actions would affect ME and our relationship. As the old saying goes...a little sin goes a long way...but with God and you and your husband...you can PREVAIL :)<br>  <br>  The first thing I recommend at this point is to find a marriage class. Lots of churches offer them.<br>  <br>  We ended up going to a Marriage 101 class at our church. It was taught by a man and his wife and the man talked a lot about how to develop a deep trust and intimate relationship with your spouse. It focused on developing your relationship with your spouse. It was an hour and a half, once a week for 6 weeks and it worked wonders for us. I thought it was going to be boring but we learned so much and my husband has become more in-tune to my needs and I have become more supportive of him. And having a man teach the class was like telling my husband "man-to-man" how to be a better husband and father. <br>  <br>  This was the description of the class:<br>  "As couples grow through the years, routines and roles can substitute for a vibrant relationship. Participants will enjoy a refresher course on what turns good relationships into great marriages. Apart from any quick fixes or emotional gimmicks, the focus is upon Biblically sound and practically relevant principles that can help any marriage."<br>  <br>  I also recommend spending more time together and being more romantic with each other. Schedule time to nurture your relationship. Marriage is work and so is romance but it's worth it. <br>  <br>  I also suggest getting a good support group of friends and family that you can trust and who are a positive role in your life.<br>  <br>  I really commend you because when you said to your husband on your wedding day "for better or worse" YOU MEANT IT! Best of Luck!!|`|AP2e90cCaa	I'm so sorry to hear about this. You must feel a million ways about the situation and that's okay.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is to think about the good in him. I'm not advocating cheating here, but people are people and sometimes people make mistakes - even you, right?<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would suggest you do something for yourself. Go away for a few days alone. Give yourself the freedom to think, write in your journal. Write a list of questions you have for your husband surrounding the cheat. When you're home, if he sits with you to talk about this and answers your questions fairly then obviously he's being truthful and wants to work things out. But you need the chance to get over the anger and hurt before you can deal with the situation clearly.<br>  <br>  Please remember why you love him, though. You didn't marry him because he's perfect.<br>  <br>  Go find yourself - you're worth it!|`|ZEitfScGaa	One thing is for certain, don't listen to the people on here that have not gone through this. They don't really know what they would do until it happens to them.<br>  I have been in this situation, but I was on the other end. I was the cheater. I had an email realtionship with a woman, and we did end up meeting one time. I will regret it for the rest of my life, I hate myself for what I did. My wife found out, and was extremely hurt, angry, she lost all trust in me. This was about a year ago. She still gets upset with me, and it is hard for me to take knowing that I am the one who caused this pain to the person that I love so much.<br>  People make mistakes sometimes, this was the biggest mistake of my life, and probably your husbands too. Things get better with time. Actually this has made our marriage stronger. We do more together, have taken up new hobbies. I do everything I can to try to gain the trust back, but it takes time. <br>  One thing I can tell you, I know its hard, but when you get mad don't use this against him everytime, he will only start to resent you. Your husband has to heal from this too. Its ok to be mad right now, and you need to let him know your mad. But after time, you have to stop holding this against him whenever you get upset with him.<br>  Good luck, I hope it all works out. I would suggest counseling as a couple to help you deal with this.|`|uB5uAp1gaa	Never done this before? how can you be so certain. I'm not trying to bash you hon, but we need to face facts in life. And its a certainty that you will never be forget this little fact, maybe not so little. And i encourage you to hit him real hard. because that's the only way you'll vent some of your anger. It's gonna be very hard to leave him though because 16 YEARS! that's a whole heap. and it's sad. he is such a disappoinment and i'm not even you. Here's the deal, fi you can't find the heart to drag yourself away from him. allow your wound to heal my doing things you've always wanted. it's a good idea to get away from him for a while. Just to be alone and really think about your next move. could you just call your husband a smelly hoe for me because he is cold.
8yE2sYGeaa	Rather than implants, look into getting them retoned. Cher did this and had them relifted.<br>  <br>  My only concern about implants is that hubby may STILL look at nudes on line|`|bO2rzfISaa	If your husband needs porn to have sex, nothing you do is going to fix him. He does it because there's something wrong with his psyche, not something wrong with your breasts. Sad.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Honestly, your husband shouldn't have to look at porn to get turned on before he makes  love to you. That's just not right. But that being said, I think its a great idea and I'm guessing he would love it, lol.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	If he's like most men, he's not looking at nude women to turn himself on, but for entertainment. Many women have this mistaken belief that their husbands or boyfriends are looking at these pics to turn them on before tackling the little woman. Not so, it's just entertainment. Nice to look.<br>  I'm sure, however, that implants would help to juice him up a bit more, seeing that your breasts are a bit meagre these days. <br>  If it doesn't improve your marriage, at least your future partner will appreciate them|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Oh, honey.  You want to go under the knife so your husband has something to look at?  What if the implants aren't enough?  Will you get lipo and collagen injections in your lips if he desides he likes how women with that look, too?<br>  <br>  No.  I don't think this will improve your marriage at all.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Boobs won't fix your marriage.<br>  <br>  Just as an aside here, if my husband had to always look at porn before he had sex with me, I would look at him as having the issue, not me.  that is not normal.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	He'll get bored with those too hun. He will at some point decide that he likes real ones, they are much softer you know! And you might get a bad boob job. Anyway a boob job is not something you should get thinking you will fix something wrong in your marriage. I have breastfed 3 kids...my boobs look great considering all that they have changed. I am not 22 anymore and my boobs don't have to look that way for me to be ok with myself or for my husband to want me. Porn is pretty disgusting as they mostly use girls between 18  and 20 and it's not a true reflection of a mature woman's body...IMO adult women look better...all that soft meat under their skin fuller hips and backsides. Appreciate yourself the way you are and if you husband is using porn as a tool to get turned on then realize the problem is not with you but with him!!!!!!!|`|3YzXWHwbaa	My husbands pat answer to all women who have smaller chest measurements is that they need a boob job except mine because then he would have to pay for it.<br>  <br>  I personally think diversity is the spice of life. If all women had big boobs there would be no comparisons <br>  besides I think Kate Hudson is perfect just the way she is.|`|SovaFpN8aa	I'm a guy, and I like nice boobs like any other guy, but breast implants are not for everybody. If you decide you want implants for your own personal reasons, go for it. If you are doing it to get anyone's approval or attention, don't do it.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	if any man doesn't find his wife desirable then don't go altering yourself for anyone do what makes you happy if getting a breast implants will make youhappier do it but if you think it will only make him happier then let him go|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	WOW!  aren't you insulted??  Your husband needs to look at other women to get turned on???!!!!  That is horrible.<br>  <br>  I would forget the boob job and ditch the jerk instead!|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	It'll probably make you feel more sexy, but it sounds like he has porn issues.|`|d08c2ff1d2c6a46f4309339f29ed68c4aa	I hate fake boobs|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	i agree with 8 ball|`|AP2e90cCaa	Instead of going under the knife to please someone else, tell him how you feel!!<br>  <br>  You may be surprised at what he says. Obviously he loves you and doesn't want to hurt you. He may not know that this hurts you in the first place! If he does know and still does it behind your back then there's a problem with respect.<br>  <br>  Lots of men look at porn and no one can say what is right and wrong in the sex department. It's an individual thing.<br>  <br>  Why not suggest watching porn Together before you go to bed? Get involved in his fantasies and feel okay about sharing yours.|`|CaRKCpMqaa	They will not 'improve your marriage' however, I believe they will improve your sex life. Also, I think it's awful he looks at women online before you guys have sex.<br>  Wether you decide to get implants or not, embrace who you are and love it:) <br>  Who knows maybe some sexy underwear might be all it takes.|`|hL9V86Nlaa	Well, I think that you should do it for your own self esteem, because what if he does not like you face are you going to change your face and so on.  Do you get my point.  Don't treat your body like car parts.  I would find out what the real issue is, even if it hurts.  At least you would know the truth.  All men are going to look a porn.  That is a fantasy. You might want to try looking at with him|`|t0sjtkjAaa	lol.<br>  <br>  pitiful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225070000AAq3jO9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	they didn't help my marriage BUT they helped me!  i see nothing wrong with porn BUT your hubby having to look at it BEFORE having sex with you?  IMO that is not right!  why not try a movie together?|`|FzFSzilmaa	is it the breasts online that do it, or the action???<br>  <br>  perhaps you should try something else before surgery, like.............|`|YyVGXt83aa	It certainly won't hurt.
p0ioXUM2aa	wow thats awful - tell him to be more aware of your emotions|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	It was just out of habit that is all.  I understand it is upsetting though.<br>  He needs to be more understanding and not just say "get over it"<br>  <br>  You two should sit down and talk.  Make sure he isn't still into her.|`|OAYaeW22aa	it happens all the time to guys its only coz he was tottaly into it and you maybe look like her and he got the names mixd up|`|d89qNyb6aa	Get over it!!!! He expects YOU to get over it????<br>  Poor you,you must be so upset hun.<br>  Tell him he's the one who needs to GET OVER IT!!!!!<br>  Tell him to get over his ex or **** off.<br>  xxx|`|713d09d4e24b6e6ced1f1de7fff7fc4aaa	So.  Forget it.  You obviously know you are not the first girl he has known.  You could get your own back next time by calling out some boy's name (true or imagined) and see how he reacts!|`|43D89edDaa	That sure is a tough one to get over my friend. That would be very hurtful because it basically shows that he had her on his mind while having sex with you. <br>  <br>  It could lead to a lot of doubt and questions:<br>  <br>  1. Does he still want her?<br>  2. Am I good enough anymore?<br>  3. Do they still talk?<br>  4. Does he dream about her?<br>  <br>  A lot of trust issues can spring up from this one.<br>  <br>  How can you get over it? well it would be easier if he was actually sorry for it instead of using the "get over it" attitude. I think you should date someone who loves you as much as you love them.<br>  <br>  It seems a bit one sided from the experience. <br>  <br>  I think you would be able to get over it easier if he was more understanding. He doesn't truly understand if he doesn't get the fact that this is a huge mistake and caused a huge amount of pain for you.|`|MI8WTnL4aa	wow i can see why that upset you the way it did. I would be really upset if someone did that to me. but it doesnt necessarily mean anything. If he was with her for a long time or they hadnt been broken up long before you got together then it was probably just out of habit. <br>  <br>  If it was an honest mistake on his part then he is bound to get annoyed with you keep bringing it up. But I can totally see where you're coming from. He probably never thought anything more of it tho. Have a final word with him and just ask if it was an honest mistake or if he still has feelings for her. if he says it was a mistake then you need to try and let it go for your relationships sake. If you really cant then you need to leave him as it will just keep on eating up at you and ruining your relationship anyway.|`|0e8mlXveaa	If this is a long term relationship I think you should try to find out if this was a genuine mistake or if he is, in fact, having contact with her that you don't know about. He has obviously been thinking about her for some reason so try to find that out first and then decide if it is worth continuing the relationship. How would he react if you had behaved the same way? Good luck and warmest wishes to you, relationships are hard enough at the best of times x|`|RJeucPf9aa	That clearly means he is A: still seeing her on the side. B: he still has feelings for her that takes time to get over C: he ment to call you by your name but her name slipped out because he is used to doing the dirty with her so much.<br>  <br>  I would pick C:  <br>  But you can make the decision on which one you strongly think it is.|`|9QeV07zJaa	Your choice. If you can't get over that, the relationship is doomed anyway. If you can but won't it is really just a power move. If this is a big deal to you, move on, for his sake because you will never treat him right and that will come back to you.|`|qN7xNavCaa	next time you **** him don't make a sound and say is that all....lol....then tell him to suck up the fact he can't give it to you like a real man....|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Omg how horrible. If it would have been me i would have left him. That to me is not something i can forgive.  Goodluck!|`|hyY9Vw1Waa	Call him a dumb *****|`|MApsz3TCaa	Oh sweetie I'm so sorry. That sucks to hear something like that especially when your being intimate. Ask him if he still has feelings for his ex. <br>  It is hard to get over something like that, even if your relationship is serious or not.  Good Luck=)|`|TDm6if1Zaa	the guys a *ick-head, u deserve someone who isn't trash - there are plenty more fish in the sea.|`|DxQmNlJ2aa	He has to make it up to you somehow!!

AA11132696	Dear sorry this guy OBVIOUSLY DOESENT LOVE YOU <br>  What the hell he has to be doing checking out other girls profile if he is with you?<br>  Hmmm if i was in your place I will break his face and kick him out INMEDIATELY><br>  That is what you need to do.Dont stay with him he is garbage and a cheater.You are blind if you dont see that.I am sorry honey but that is the truth get rid of him  go out on the weekend and find a replacement ASAP!!<br>  <br>  Listen to me ged rid of him before you find him going out with other girls and cheating DONT WAIT TILL THAT HAPPENS.I can see that coming.... he is doing somethin fishy THAT IS FOR SURE.<br>  Dear get rid of the rat before you suffer really bad worst than now.But before make sure you slap him hard with all your fury on the face so he learns a word RESPECT YOU.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	First I understand why he or anyone else for that matter won't give up passwords.  Your insecurity with your relationship speaks volumes, either you are unhappy with yourself or he has given you reasons not to trust him.  I wouldn't worry about anything.  If he starts spending less time with you or acting weird then I would say it's time for you to move on.|`|SqDWUl8zaa	talk to him about it.<br>  dont ask striaght forward for his password.<br>  <br>  my ex had a myspace, facebook, and a myyearbook<br>  i knew he always checked out girls, he'd even tell me about some of them.<br>  we were best friends for the longest time and we were planning on getting married<br>  [[other things got in the way]]<br>  but when i thought he was talking to the other girls he was checking out, <br>  i confronted him, i normally yelled and screamed about it<br>  but i asked calmly<br>  told him i loved him and i trusted him but the secrets bothered me and made me question things.<br>  <br>  we talked about it a few times and after a couple days he came to me and we exchanged passwords to everything we had.<br>  <br>  hope it helps<br>  and good luck.<br>  and remember if he is that its never your fault that hes doing it..<br>  <br>  some guys are just like that.... sadly|`|wAzQqPtpaa	talk to him about it. <br>  <br>  let him know you trust him. <br>  <br>  if he really cares about you he wont mess around with other girls, and if you really really care about him, you will just trust him. <br>  <br>  yes i know i already said that. but trust me. trust is the most important key to having a healthy relationship...<br>  <br>  just give him time, don't argue with him, let him know your there and you are not going anywhere, if he has that security blanket from you then he wont do anything stupid. <br>  i promise.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	he is talking to other girls, trust me on that one!
SjEH1Lx6aa	No, because even though you can prove your spouse was talking to them, you can't prove what they were talking ABOUT.<br>  <br>  You can't prove it without an actual picture of them at a hotel or maybe a dirty/graphic email detailing their intent.<br>  <br>  *I am not advocating going through your spouse's email or private things, EVEN if you suspect adultery.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	yes,|`|HVY2rqzfaa	no, how do you know they weren't discussing world of warcraft tactics?|`|SR1FN2nqaa	sounds like a good question for your divorce lawyer but i would definately think she was seeing him. proving it is something else.|`|FzFSzilmaa	or may prove that you are a snooper...<br>  <br>  if you aren't happy, just dump him/her...|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	no|`|9ae919aecab255ec4dd5fb19b5c555e8aa	Who do you have to prove it too?If you think he is cheating find out! My ex was talking to a woman I caught him and I heard the way he was talking to her ,I listened in on the conversation and I knew by the tone in his voice that there was something there.So I thought about it long and hard and I left him and sure enough less then one month later she was pregnant.And that was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life,but now I have a new man ,who I trust and life is good.If you can't trust your spouse then you have nothing!!!!!!
POZvhqj4aa	grow out your hair dress like barbie you don't need long nails to prove that you are a woman I have short and unpainted nails it's the way you dress and how you carry yourself I mean add more feminine touch to yourself.|`|swV3SIw7aa	dont change<br>  x_____X<br>  theres nothing wrong with that<br>  i was like that too<br>  not much of a difference<br>  the most i changed though<br>  was i wore more girls clothes (NO DRESSES!! D<) more like..more girl shirts<br>  i still wear guys pants<br>  the occasional tight jeans (no skinny...stupid...)<br>  <br>  theres absolutely nothing wrong with it<br>  but if you want to change, just go to like..a girly cousin, sister, mom, family relative<br>  tell them you want to be a bit more girly<br>  (done that...they turned me into barbie......x______X but then i changed the way they did it and made my own style :] )<br>  <br>  good luck|`|2sgYribSaa	Well you should really try some make up, it doesn't have to be like all heavy. Just some foundation eye liner and and always some type of lip gloss or lip stick to bring everything out, you can never leave your lips plan. Buy some relaxing like grungy girl clothes, it will be a start =] and straight your hair let it down sometime!|`|NCvvwPEdaa	My question is why you want to change into a chic, may be for your boyfriend. From my point of view if you would be my girlfriend i would have been accepted you as a cutest chic irrespective of you been a tom boyish attitude or looks.|`|XVygEWLcaa	ummmmm if u hate all that chick stuff then how would it be possible to make u like it??? why do you care anyway?|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	do everything you hate.|`|4wNDMiRXaa	Just do it.  <br>  <br>  Wake up the next day and start dressing up more feminine.  Hang out with your closest girl friend.  And keeping talking yourself through this mind changing attitude.  You will slowly get use to it.  you will also notice how great it could be to be a woman too! <br>  <br>  I am a guy btw.|`|zGthY1Jeaa	Bein a tomboy is kinda common. How does it make u different? find ur own uniqe style, but if thats what u like continue it, dont try to change it, unless its becoming a bother for u and the ppl close to u.

You should pave your own path and follow your dreams.  I would not give up your business, as that must be your passion or you would not have started it.  She is following her dreams, she should not want you to give up yours.  Two years is only 24 months, is only 104 weeks, is only 730 days.  If it is meant to be then time will tell, you will miss one another so much that one of you will cave, but I wouldn't rush into it at this point, give it some time and a visit, rather than a complete uproot.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	no time to get a new girlfriend unless you want to get kidnapped by Muslim Exteremists
AA11359741	Hmmmm if i were you i would just sit back and let him do the chasing to save yourself from looking desperate!  <br>  <br>  4-5 days seems like quite a long time for someone who used to talk to you everyday, sounds like he's a jerk and is being a coward by not telling you he's not into you but just ignoring you hoping you'll get the message!<br>  <br>  If i were you i would do nothing.  Don't try to contact him, wait for him to contact you but beware he may be full of excuses!  If he doesn't contact you again, then you've had a lucky escape!  Boys like that aren't worth the worrying!<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|35s6yv88aa	Sigh. If only I had all the time I've wasted explaining things to women. <br>  <br>  If you just sleep with a guy and you aren't in a serious relationship he's going to think youre easy and do this with everyone so hes going to move on. If you respect yourself and dont sleep with every guy that looks you in the eye and smiles then you wont always feels used. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you didnt sleep with him then either he wants to just be friends or he decided that you dont put out quick enough and left. You might think this is a bad thing but it isnt because if he was worth it he wouldve stayed cause he actually liked you as a person not your body.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	maybe he's noticed something about you he didn't like..i.e. you snore, drool, or hog the bed. in any case, if you haven't heard from him, he's probably not interested anymore.|`|lckv4hs3aa	just text him, he'll be really happy to hear from you first for a change|`|0eiAMvokaa	He used you.|`|Stwj8CRmaa	One thing Face Book destroys lives and relationships same goes for myspace too and if he is not staying in contact with you he must not want to have thing to do with you any more and my advice for you is to move on and let it all go and delete his messages and anything else you have from him and get him off your mind so you can move on with your life OK and I'm a guy and I speak my mind and the truth and I'm honest and its sounds like he's not in to you any more and he has found someone else to play for a fool so just let go and move on from him OK I meant it in good way to you not a bad way OK .|`|g2QUNwZzaa	maybe bcuz nothing happened is why he stopped texting u. guys can fake being nice and interesting to u to get what they want (in ur pants)
KuZJ2q4Paa	I would kick him in the balls, yell and cuss him out, tell him how he made me feel,and etc!|`|HU4Kmi5vaa	laugh and laugh and laugh....<br>  and give him a niiiiice kick in the nuts or face or stomach (wherever my foot is gonna land :))|`|0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Nothing...  because I don't care about him anymore.  Karma will hurt him more than I ever could and there's NOTHING that could prove to him more that you don't care than just walking away.  If you're still mad, you still care.  If you can truly smile and walk away, you're over him and you've truly moved on with your life and are happy.|`|PR8i6cV8aa	I would say "This is for all the pain you have caused me!" and crush him. Or like.. Pick him up and take him home and torture him. Yeah thats a little mean. But hey, it would only be fair.|`|CZrM6idFaa	Nothing, I believe God would of done that to him, and that God will deal with his wrongs....KARMA
VY4LqfLpaa	I would't have to say anything...but he sure wouldn't survive...|`|UgcPxd4maa	Why do you keep asking this question?|`|ma6Re8B1aa	This question is getting OLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I would tell him to scamper into that little rat-hole over there and never show his little rat-face to me again.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	Are you sure you want to know <br>  I WOULD STEP ON HIM <br>  beside my EX has stunk ( hahah) I think meanest shrink people|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Maybe I'd step on him. J/K|`|UnpxpOKTaa	Nothing, perhaps show him to the door.  He wasn't worth my time then, and isn't now.  I don't love him anymore, so I don't really care what happens to him.  I am just grateful he stays away.|`|c4d63478f0175c245353b6222ab7a81eaa	I'd pick him up be the shirt collar and say "How does it feel?, you made me feel two inches tall every time you abused me. Your lucky I don't squash you like the bug you are."|`|lzooHi0Baa	Just reminded me how much I hate the bastard.   I would take him to the zoo and feed him to the lions.|`|xCifmFfkaa	I'd stomp on that m*therfucker before he got the chance to even open his mouth. I'd squish 'em like a little bug.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	I'd laugh at him. I got him back for the abuse before I dumped him. We're friends now, but that wouldn't save him from being picked on|`|xCfHnQBbaa	I wish you would shrink down to 2 inches tall so i can squash you for asking this question so many times. Geez get a life!
AA10959572	Nope...<br>  <br>  The deepest love is when it's with the person that you will love and spend your life with, that loves you back just as strongly.<br>  <br>  The first love usually sticks out as it's your "basis" for comparison.  A lot of people don't understand this and have messed up later relationships because of it.<br>  <br>  And the younger you are when you have this "first love" the less capable of understanding what love is about, so people tend to idolize it (remember it as better than what it really was).|`|sPQBluKEaa	yeah, it's true. your first love is always the deepest. you'll never forget her even if you don't get back together.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Back when I was 14, I thought I would never get over my ex. Now that I'm older, and I read all the letters we wrote one another, I'm really surprised how much my feelings for him changed.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's different for different people. My ex called me and told me what you wrote. I was flattered.. people kinda move on I guess.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	Nope. The love that is the deepest is the truest one.<br>  <br>  You can think you're in love at 13 and not really know<br>  <br>  what love is even about, you know? And you might have <br>  <br>  thought that was your first "love". When it wasn't.  <br>  <br>  How deep your love is depends on the amount of <br>  <br>  compassion you have for one another.|`|RJeucPf9aa	Depends on how long the two have been seeing each other. And yes the first love is the deepest because you've never known that kind of love. And love is generally very strong for the first time. And If your lucky you will not have to go threw a brake up ever. And if you do don't sweat it because. That's just Experience for you.|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	I believe it is true that the first love, cannot be compared to others.|`|POZvhqj4aa	yes most of the time that's why they say first cut is the deepest.|`|HhgWWMRPaa	hi , <br>  Yes is it , the first love is the deepest love , <br>  it's hard to forgot it . <br>  you must keep it .<br>  so love is nice whne you find the right one ...|`|ldXA6Dviaa	sometimes but it could be the last love
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	I would be grateful that some other poor woman took this deadbeat off my hands...
6ycnSoaRaa	I agree, I would call him out on it- let him know that it ticks you off when he does it. If he gets defensive.... just be blunt- and say, well crap- "If so and so said some crap like that, you would find it halarious- so what in the hell is your attitude all about just cause I said it?" Plus if you guys have been together for 4 years now- you know him well enough- I'm pretty sure that you would know if he's trying to get rid of you.....|`|YtJ3yf3Iaa	probably, tell him to go|`|UhnetgNkaa	you should ask him the next time he does that. He may not be aware of what he is doing.|`|p5kzRDIpaa	i dont see how it can be "casual" if youve been with him for 4 years!<br>  nobody on here can tell you that, you're just gunna have to ask him tbh<br>  did he get wound up by your sarcastic humour before now?

rcN76taEaa	I agree with Savannah. Perhaps it is insecurity, fear, or maybe past experience. Trust me, you're not the only one who has these dreams. I have a boyfriend who is very loyal, as well. I have dreams where he would cheat on me as well. Lying, cheating, leaving, the works. Most likely somewhere in your mind, you feel maybe, this could be too good to be true. No one could be THAT loyal, right? Not.Your life isn't a movie where there has to be drama to be interesting. Don't worry and spend time with your boyfriend. These dreams are most likely nothing, but since I don't know your boyfriend. I wouldn't know whether or not you should be listening to your dreams. Tell a close friend who also knows your boyfriend and see what they think about your dreams.|`|Ch7Q3buOaa	Those dreams mean that you're normal. don't read too much into dreams, they are what they are... just your subconscious working out your daily stressors and fears.|`|IYevTWlDaa	Well sometimes I have dreams about killing or something bad and when I wake up the following morning I either see it in T.V. or in the news about that dream. Not the same exact thing but some things about my dream. And if I dream with my family member I call all of them up and tell them to be care full. It doesn't hurt to let them know and be on the safe side!!! Sometimes your dreams are telling you something.|`|Kfr8AQ4Qaa	dreams will come out only if you "THINK" that your boyfriend is cheating to you.Its mind over matter. the question here is how frequently you think or thinking your boyfriend is cheating on you? if you think much of him cause you love him so much and think that you know he cant cheat on you it may be the possible reason why your getting this bad dreams. Try to ease yourself or like YOGA and clear your mind if take this it will help a lot to you cause it will refresh your mind. And when you go to sleep try to take some ease songs yoga songs if you have mp3 or cd whatever so when you go to sleep you will not get bad dreams. Try the dream catcher it catches your bad dreams. Hope it helps. TC|`|88Hozyl1aa	The reason you have these dreams is because that's what you're afraid of. You are afraid that your boyfriend will cheat on you, or ignore you. You have convinced your concious mind that this will never happen, you've convinced yourself that he's loyal, and he would never hurt you. But subconciously (your dreams) you're afraid that he will. Maybe you should talk to him about your fears and have him assure you that he would never do anything to hurt you.<br>  Best of luck,<br>  Savannah (:|`|ybjAtRhSaa	I've had dreams about my dad murdering me, but I doubt that'll happen lol.  It happens to everyone.
NECU1hSWaa	Don't dump him or get angry, it sounds like you have some feelings for this guy.<br>  <br>  Just sit down, look him in the eye and ask him to tell you the truth and what your feelings are about him lying to you.<br>  <br>  Hope it works out for you both... x|`|AA11596133	NOTHING says you should HAVE to learn how to handle anyone who lies to you. <br>  <br>  Tell him to get lost. You do not need his problems, and if you continue to hang with him, his problems will end up being YOUR problem.  The people you choose to hang with are a direct reflection of you.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	NO|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Sounds like he just wants to get out of town with his friends and those girls and enjoy a little "bachelor party" or so he says. Booking a trip with other girls is NOT cool, honey. I don't care how "wonderful" your relationship is supposed to me - it's obviously not that wonderful if this so-called boyfriend books trips out of the country with a bunch of women, and then lies about it! <br>  <br>  You should handle him by letting him to to Mexico a single man.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	just leave him!!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Because there are NO GUYS GOING.  He is shady and is trying to run game on you.|`|6E81yM9Eaa	First of all, if he hasnt mentioned about the boys well welcome to the machismo man group. Let me tell you  something that when they start that way it usually goes on to another episode. Or he would include you for the next trip. Most of them likes to keep secrets. How about you turning  it around , and let him feel the way you do so that he could feel how you feel. Because i also have a relationship that he was just like that. I love him but if in the beginning if it starts shaky forget it will continue.|`|AA11635143	Even people who go to church can be liars.  Wake up and smell the coffee; he doesn't love you, NEVER HAS, NEVER WILL, or he would have taken you along on the trip.  He's telling you that you are not invited because he's taking another girl.<br>  <br>  Find another boyfriend while he's away and surprise him when he returns.  If you really want to surprise him, be at the airport, his departure gate, when he leaves on the trip.  That will tell you the whole story.  Be sure and tell him "goodbye."|`|bglr4m0Naa	Dump him. That's how you handle him.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Dump the gypsy|`|rkFVxFb4aa	This guy is lying to you and I HIGHLY suspect he's cheating. Relationships cannot survive if one is lying. I would cut my losses and move on b4 he hurts you even more.|`|a984cQjKaa	he didn't tell you because he's probably up to something. it sounds very suspicious to me.  if you can't trust him you don't need him in your life.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	liar liar ..put his pants on fire ... dump him|`|7ko9czaaaa	ask a lot of questions about this it don,t sound right,|`|xggSASTwaa	well either way, he has just showed you his true colors. He's a liar, if he has'nt gone on the trip yet, you can offer him one chance of redemption: Don't go or we are over. If he has already gone, then he is a true scumbag and you need to dump him. Believe me, someone else will treat you just as good or better without the lies. Who goes on a trip with an even amount of girls and guys and doesnt plan to hook up? Maybe a gay guy. His intentions were sour and you deserve better my dear.|`|HfXJgwWCaa	Could you not ask one of his friends? A bit scheming, i know. But if you want to find out the truth, if you've been on double dates, you must know a couple of his friends. It does seem odd that he won't tell you who even the guys are. <br>  Or if not, then be the bigger person before he leaves and when he gets back ask to see the photographs, that should be evidence of who went.|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	Two red flags: <br>  <br>  1. "...lying..."<br>  2. "I feel like I don't know who he is..."<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, you're going to have to let this one go. Lying is a dealbreaker. You don't have to understand him. You only have to trust him and know who he is. That's clearly not possible here. Get out before you really get hurt (AIDS, etc).|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	your kidding right???<br>  dump him immediately<br>  go listen to some beyonce<br>  get some self esteem<br>  jeez!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|sqFIfI3Baa	Spank the heck out of him.|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Oh god break up with him!! And tell him to stop going to church because he's a hypocrite!!|`|itcAFDZYaa	I think you should end the relationship now. It is hard to tell what else he has lied to you about.|`|Di9ykNJeaa	Leave him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NlH0OiLSaa	Dump him. :]|`|MdiADb0yaa	dump him fast and online. because hes a cheater and he likes it because hes not stoping and ya be strong and show him that your strong and dont need him :)|`|gL5jy3Sqaa	My friend was doing the same thing! He was cheating on her....:( dump him and get out before it's to late!!!|`|65ojSBXgaa	Oh sweetie,<br>  He’s lying to you why would he tell you the truth? The way I see it, guys don’t tell you because “What you don’t know wont hurt you” I know it hurts but why deal with it. The truth is it’s very hard to deal with a lying boyfriend because if they did it once and got away with it they will do it again. Why would you want to get hurt? Oh because he loves you ??? Yeah right a loving guy wouldn’t do anything to hurt you and would care about your heart and feelings. Trust me I learned a lot and I give you my advice. Guys like him know how to play with girls feelings but hey if you think there’s nothing suspicious about him and he didn’t give you any reason to trust him then trust him. If you believe that he loves you then trust him sugar. One other thing I will tell you is to listen yourself and never doubt your gut feeling ok , take care!<br>  <br>  Gail Friend|`|LT7TqDLdaa	you handle a lying boyfriend just like you would anyone that lies to you. just like a liar! don't believe anything he tells you and don't trust him even when you can see him. lol but if you have funny feelings in the pit of your stomach trust those feelings and get out while you can.  always and i mean always trust your female intuition.  he's not going on trips with the guys all the time and even if he was he must be a homosexual.  but if you are a young person and i will assume you are. sweetie no young man is going to settle down with just one woman.  it has be proven since the beginning of time, hell you can barely find an older man who can settle down with just one woman. so finding those qualities in a young man in this day and age sweetie just doesn't exist and we fool ourselves into thinking otherwise.  we fall in love with our ideas for a typical life, but the reality of the situation is you are in love with a freaking monster.  all men play especially young ones.  i am 38 and my husband is 47 and believe it or not he still tries to pull fast ones with me. but i know when he is lying and i dont give in to those lies. you dont have to accept that. but again you are young live your life and i would suggest you take trips with the "girls" wink wink.  even if you dont go on a trip pretend you did and leave home for a week or two.  give him what he gives you.  LIES|`|d27c5Bodaa	First ask slyly around. Once you've gotten enough information to know what you're talking about ask him straight up, tell him everything that you told us. Tell him how you feel, and don't accept no as an answer. And besides any decent guy that you've been dating for 10 months would have been more than ecstatic to take you along on all of his trips. Boys need guy time, but they don't need guy time over 100 miles away.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u wouldn't be so secretive if u had nothing to hide would u? if he will not tell u who he's going with, than i smell a rat. i see a liar. he should be an open book especially if u are an exclusive couple,and seeing no one else. he isn't taking u and didn't tell u about it and won't say whose going because there are other women going too. perhaps there is just something you aren't seeing here.when a man has secrets it never means anything good.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I would say that is a huge red flag, but wait and see how he behaves when he gets back from the trip...and also if he shows you any photographs!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I don't know, but I see red flags.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	My definition of a boyfriend is not the same as yours, I think you need to rethink what you want from a guy this or honesty and respect!|`|m8UEGUaGaa	By dumping him.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, since you already saw the emails from the girls he's going with, I hope you'll be able to face reality soon. He's lying and cheating.  Your relationship isn't what you thought it was.<br>  <br>  So, you accept that he lies and cheats or you move on. My sister chose to stay with a cheater 20 years ago and it has destroyed her mentally. I hope that won't be your choice.|`|8GfEEzzhaa	Well, look on the bring side - he is actually not a lying bf. He chooses to tell you that he won't tell you, instead of lying to you. Thats a nice sing.<br>  As for why not tell you - maybe he doesn't want you to know these buddies of his since they are impolite or  something.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Dump him and book a trip to mexico with a hot new guy!|`|gjaPNWbTaa	By adding the letters E and X in front of "boyfriend".|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	he tell or your off that way you win.. drop him .|`|HGRBtDIiaa	this seem really sketchy and he is probably seeing someone else. i'd move on|`|RncUc0traa	he DONT WANT U THERE  he want enjoy himself and probably cheat on you.. gosh lol|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I was in a relationship that was very similar for over a year and when I finally had enough of the BS is when I found out that all the time he was spending being affectionate he was doing the same with a few other girls too. We lived together so I never really saw it coming. He didn't stay out all night or get strange phone calls. He actually hardly ever hung out with the guys either. Some guys just find the time to cheat. Believe me you should get out before you get hurt even worse or before he brings you a gift from the STD  Fairy! Good Luck.|`|HlR7egIeaa	My experience?? Where there's smoke theres fire, its obvious by him not telling you who the "guys" are that are going that he's l-y-i-n-g! Why couldn't he tell you who they are? That doesnt make any sense. I know you want to believe him, and I know 10 months is alot invested, but the writing is on the wall with this one hun. He either needs to start getting honest or you have some thinking to do about the relationship because if you dont have honesty and trust it won't work! And you deserve to be with someone who is honest and puts your feelings first!<br>  <br>  And unfortunately, some guys are REALLY good at showing affection and what you percieve to be love but will lie like snakes to your face. Looks like he's starting to show his true colors cause they start to come out eventually!!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck girl!|`|3J46bao1aa	Honey I am sorry! I know how you feel. of course somewhere in the back of our minds we want to remain positive, but the fact that he is trying to hide it poses a question. You need to confront him and ask him why he wouldn't share this trip with you like the others? Also, is the boy to girl ratio on this trip even? If so, try asking him how he would feel if the shoe was on the opposite foot? Hope you can resolve this issue.|`|9vSwYuwMaa	If you love him you need to trust him.Without trust you will never be really happy.you need to ask yourself has he ever done anything to make you dout him if not just love and trust in him and he will too.if he has hurt you and lied then you need to ask yourself can you live your life without true trust?let it go the truth always comes out in the end.|`|5KZdTMPDaa	that is too many red flags for me.  I say part your own way.  You know in your gut what the right decision is.  Be happy it only took 10 months of your time before realizing he is a liar.|`|F6dApOJtaa	Dump him. Do you really want to be with a guy that lies?|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	If I were you I would get out of this relationship NOW. If you don't, you are setting yourself up for a lot of heartache.|`|mRffo5G8aa	Perhaps you're having a wonderful relationship...but obviously...he isn't.  Otherwise...why lie?  Wake up and smell the awful odor of relationship rot.  He is probably two timing you but hasn't made up his mind whether the other relationship is worth leaving you for.  He is having the best of both worlds at present...but yours is about to fall apart.  Call him on the carpet...give an ultimatum about leveling with you and pack your bags...the party's been over for awhile...you're just the last to have heard it.  Good luck. You have my sympathies...best of luck in your next romance.|`|oryGaz4eaa	OK. I want to encourage you to break away from this guy. You seem to be obsessed (not meant to insult you but help you) with him and you have forgot about your own happiness. Trust will always be an issue with this guy and you deserve to be with someone you trust and someone who makes you laugh. This relationship sounds very stressful and you don't need such stress in your life.  Don't be afraid to be alone. You don't want to settle for this guy. This is a new beginning for you. Just tell him that you are not happy being with him and that you feel that you can never trust him. Leave it at that. Avoid feeling sorry for him. Do not go back to him. If you need to mourn, do so alone, not around him. It's okay if you cry and you miss him. Take all the time you need to grieve and ask for your family's love right now. I promise that you will be okay. I love you and I don't even know you. Bottom line: I want you to be happy.
AA11550245	I honestly think you answered your own question.  Next time send the money yourself this way you will not have any problems.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Wow you gave money to a meth head and expected her to not spend it on drugs?<br>    get into the real world that money is gone <br>   learn and don't make that mistake again|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	If she has a Meth problem I wouldn't believe a word that came out of her mouth.  There is no reason you would have to wait 6 weeks for that.  And plus, you know she never sent it.  Kiss your $400 good bye.  And don't ever loan someone with a drug problem money!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You handed her 400 when she has a meth problem! do neither of you have any brains! he won't see the money.|`|TSmego9vaa	Do it yourself,as questions. You guys should start doing it yourselves. =]
NQEbrRvraa	well... i am a recording artist on a label in the USA and I feel that you are taking your relationship out of proportion I don't mean to philosophise though I'm sure you've heard it before money can't buy love nor can it buy happiness. If you truely love your boyfriend and feel because you've been together for 11 years you need to get married then get married. Remember, even though he isn't rich, doesn't mean he won't treat you with the respect you deserve, whereas in my experience, people with money behind them tend to treat the ones they love with less respect.<br>  Good luck|`|ZXhSQfvqaa	watch west side story.   it will answer your question, and listen to west end girls,      <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Go for love, or why is life worth living?|`|rkFVxFb4aa	this question is retarded....
iVU7beMuaa	Its almost ironic that you are contemplating these feelings now, after he has made a serious course correction.<br>  <br>  You are in a hard position and unlimately your the only one who can decide if you can live with his past actions.  But if you do decide you are interested in rebuilding your relationship, its a good idea to reinforce your husband's good efforts.  If all his attempts to recover what was lost are rebuffed he may stop trying.  <br>  <br>  Rebuilding a marriage takes both parties best efforts, and forgiveness is critical for the offended spouse.  This does not excuse his past behaviors or erase the pains that his actions have caused. It does show, however, your fidelity to your own marriage vow to be faithful in the difficult times.  What times could be more difficult than these?|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The counseling is a very good thing.  Kudos for taking that step towards foxing your marriage.<br>  <br>  It will take time.  Possibly years to get back on track.  But it is worth it.<br>  <br>  Is the counseling helping him to open up to you and talk?  If not, maybe switch counselors.  <br>  <br>  By chance is he in the military?  My husband and I have spent more half of our marriage apart.  Sometimes it gets tough, but we never stop talking and sharing.  <br>  <br>  And has he been deployed?  Is it possible he has PTSD?|`|1745a7f7ca767f1ca80739a3af841dbaaa	Wow there is a lot of me's and i's in this... before you decide whether or not to separate your family maybe you should consider what you do for him instead of what he can do for you all the time. Give him a massage, kiss him w/feeling, hold him!! Sometimes as women we fail to realize that men need that intimacy too. They are just like us, they have emotions and needs that need to be attended to. Then when our men stray we wonder why and blame them. Take time just you and him DAILY to just enjoy, spoil, and whatnot each other. Remember as women we have the power to make or break our families. Use your femininity to your benefit!!! You'll be surprised the difference it will make. <br>  Wish you and your family the best!!!|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	Only you can answer your question. What is important is what you feel is fair because you are the one living it. I have lived it also and can tell you that you never truly forgive and you never, ever forget. Still, I am working on mine because the love is still there. The relationship still has meaning. Can you find that in yours?|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Show him how wild you can be. I'm serious. Arrange a crazy fun weekend together. You both need to lighten up. He's working on it and so are you. Marriage is full of ups and downs and often because men can be so emotionally retarded. Continue going to counseling but don't make every day about the issues. You both need to take breaks and have a good time together.....reminisce....go on dates. Just because you're married doesn't mean that's an excuse to stop trying to win each other over.|`|xnzJfwITaa	I am so sorry for your pain.

He is in therapy that means he wants your marriage to succeed. Arrange a weekend for you two to get away, make a date night. Burn his fishing poles.|`|Qc9mtVrPaa	Let me begin by saying that you're obviously in a very bad position and I'm empathize with you. I recently separated after 10 years (by my own decision) and it's the hardest thing I've ever encountered.<br>  Having said that, I'll say that only you will know for sure when you've had enough. If you think that you and your husband may still have a chance, then do all that you can. Go to counseling, go to therapy, and go to anything else that may help the relationship. Plan a weekend away with just the two of you.<br>  BUT, once it's over, you'll know it's over. When the thought of being with just him for a weekend is unbearable, then you've probably had enough. If you lay in bed together, and you may just as well be alone, then you've had enough.<br>  I know that I probably didn't provide an answer, but your question struck a nerve and I simply wanted to say what I could.
NECU1hSWaa	Tell her your feelings for her, what you like about her so much and then ask her. Girls like it when you tell them nice things about them (:|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Just start out a nice conversation and then ask for her phone number. If she insists and gives you a call, schedule something that you guys can do together.|`|CsZVPfwdaa	u shuld make sure she likes u first!! bcuz it will prolly b kinda awkward lol make it casual|`|1jIzBUkhaa	ask her , thats all you can do just ask|`|YyXimsFFaa	if she said no the first time and she said no and you got closer then if she says no again then it should be fine in a few weeks or whatever!|`|FgRiw5CLaa	well i think you should ask her i mean im really no one to say i have been in and out of relationships but if you guys have grown closer then do it and even if she says no take it as a grain of salt as long as you knew what she thought instead of sitting there wondering what she thinks and if shes a true friend either way she will still be your friend|`|kYfoa03haa	Ask her out. Be casual and ask her out as friends. See if she wants to go see a movie or get something to eat. Sometimes it is better to start off as friends on a date that way there is no pressure. Go out and do something fun. If she likes you than you'll know. She'll want to hang out again and than you can make your next date a little bit more personal that way she knows you like her. Good luck and don't stress. Everything will work out.|`|ooAAWyzeaa	You should ask her out, but before you do, tell her friend that you are going to ask her. Ask her friend to please not to put her off.<br>  <br>  But have you ever considered the fact that this girls friend might like you? I mean, if she was putting this girl off, maybe she wants you to ask her out instead...consider this.|`|smsYTy4Qaa	well if you're too afraid you'll mess up your guys' friendship then i say no.. dont ask her.. wait till its like the right moment. because if you guys are really close friends.. it will eventually turn into something. first its just friends.. then you'll turn into bestfriends then it will turn into feelings for eachother and then you's will prob turn into a couple. if it helps, i say just ask her how she feels about you, then tell her how you feel.|`|BEyQHEJqaa	go for it! ask her out!<br>  us girls like getting asked out <br>  take a chance and see where you both an go.<br>  you never kno she could be the love of your life, all you can do is<br>  ask her out|`|3dYXHClraa	Well,you should at least try once last time to see what will happen,cause at first if she was mad and said no,then you should have a better opportunity to have a "yes" answer!
UPhngg5Waa	friend.<br>  As him out.|`|a9BMA7wpaa	he protects his rep. but it sounds like he might want to be more than friends. ask him out or talk to him about it.|`|eJ46Bix5aa	He probaly at times thinks of you as a girlfriend but, he doesn't want to be embarressed in front of his friends. You should flirt with him a little bit and a week later ask him out.

U4AeZ41Raa	Ok, this is what I think about it all, honestly.<br>  <br>  Watching porn is okay.  Going to strip clubs (without you), is not okay.  You playing with a toy is okay.  You running his errands is very generous, especially with your family.<br>  <br>  If he's keeping ex-gf stuff and purposely not listening to you about the strip club, and this is hurting your feelings, you need to explain that to him, give him one last chance, and then when he does it again, break up with him for good.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I know that sucks :/  I would hate to be in that position, but that's just my honest opinion.
AA11596133	PLEASE do NOT be an idiot and REPEAT making the same mistake again.  <br>  <br>  You NEED to move on, forward. and do not look back.  The guy is a manipulative user, and he WILL hurt you again if you let him, because NOW he knows HOW to.  He has NO respect for females, and less respect for DUMB females.  Even talking with him shows you are not all that intelligent.<br>  <br>  Stay away from him and his problems.|`|UP33GlBwaa	No, he clearly doesnt care for her much, but he also doesnt care for you much.  You both should dump his butt.  As for you, find a real guy that cares about you and you only.  Why do you want to be part of this drama.  If he cheated on her with you, he will most likely cheat on you with someone else.  Get the drift?  Respect yourself and get out of this relationship ASAP.  Good luck to you and remember, there are alot of fish in the sea.  You will find one that is right for you.  This guy clearly is not.|`|7o0yIId5aa	If he is keeping his girlfriend around and not planning on ending things with her either, he clearly does not care for you either. He's using you to hook up, and sweet talking you to keep you around.|`|RRxlVNHQaa	wow thats weird i have the same exact story.. like exactly almost.. i wish i could tell u lol. but i think the other people r right that that guy is just using u && that the other dickface is just using me. <br>  we can do better...|`|rkFVxFb4aa	he just wants the best of both worlds and sounds like ur dumb enough to give it to him|`|TSmego9vaa	He dosen't care about you either,he wants to be with her and just wants you for one thing. Ask yourself whos he with not you. Right. Put yourself in her shoes,you would probably be mad if he did this to you. He wants his cake and to eat it to... =[|`|I73x03xraa	Girl this is my issue too. i have been with someone for 14yrs, but there was was year that we were apart, i found out he was cheating on me several times, well one night i went out and i walked into a bar and to my surprise this georgous guy came over to me and i was dancing to my favorite sng crazzybitch by buckcherry, he asked me to dance well we ended up being with eachother for a year we still talk i still have feelings for him and he feels the same way but he thought the sun shined on the otherside. but now he's regreting letting go, i do at times too.. but the man i am with is the father of 3out of 4 children, i have good stable life with him i am not so sure what it would be like if i was to let my heart back in i do love my husband but my heart says there is something missing, i go to see my ex here&there but its hard because when i'm with him, i feel as though this is right feels good to see him and to hear his voice but he's a player, my hubby is all about me &the kids, so i am torn i have not gotten sexual with my ex since sept, but he's like a hard habit to break, so only by my view of things i can only say you need to find his real intentions is this something he's willing to leave her for or are you just a booty call? if you want to be with him go for it but keep your guard up . he probably does care for her but she's not you, and he probably misses you in many ways she may be a nice person or she may only be Bi---h who knows just stand your ground and ask him "what do you want from me"?tell him , i won't be 2nd choice or @ your convience, try not taking his calls avoid him for a week or so see what he does if he's still callig or coming around then his intentions may very well be in your favor but never settle for less. there,s plenty of good men out there you don't have to except to be his excape from his relationship with her, . stop playing his fool, go where your heart is but like i said before never settle for less.|`|uBssj3Znaa	he is using you ... if he wanted to break up with her to be with you, he would. So he obviously doesn't care that much for you.
NECU1hSWaa	Be open and honest with him, tell him how you feel and then ask him how does he feel about what you said.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hXFndli2aa	IF i were you i would go wtih the flow and see what happens, what if he likes you too but he is taking things slowly to get to know and you need to get to know him more to see whether you like him too|`|nv7Cofm5aa	Test him first..... by sitting in another seat (not the same seat you sat in last time). Most people are territorial and unconsciously enjoy sitting in their same spot. I want to make sure he is not just sitting in the same spot all the time. So find another seat and give it a shot. If he sits next to you... then that is a good indicator. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, ask him out and be brave. Don't be afraid. And let him clearly know your intentions.|`|ShyCBmj5aa	Just go with the flow... i hate to tell yooh but just because somebody flirts with you dosen't mean he's really into yooh.<br>  <br>  Just wait and see what happens... besides if it doesn't work out then in the end you'll know what was the right choice.|`|iX96Hkrkaa	Flirt with him a little and if he flirts back he likes you, then make a move.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I would ask him ,|`|zZImqhNbaa	no i don't think that you should ask him because you dont want to scare him away what if want to be your friend or if hes a shy guy then he will be embarresed onceyou ask him you should wait to see what hapens and meawhile get to rearry know him as friends..if he eally likes you he will tell you ...good luck!!|`|SZKEydttaa	flirt a little and than if it turns out than go for it trust me this will work i would know....|`|zFZvz0ghaa	YOU JUST NEED TO GO WITH THE FLOW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS..BECAUSE WHAT IF HIS FEELINGS ARE NOT THE SAME AS YOURS?
xc8bnpCvaa	WOW! My daughter is only 9.5 and she has been wearing deodorant for 2 years and a bra the last year. SHe came straight out about the bra 'I WANT A BRA" the deodorant was me, I am really funny about body odors so both of my children started wearing it as soon as they started to get odoriferous after playing. <br>  Maybe your mum is as nervous about talking to you as you are about talking to her. Just tell her " hey i need to have a private talk with you" Let the bf slide for a bit, definitely discuss the deodorant, bra and make up|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Tell her that the kids are laughing at the way your chest bounces and show threw your clothes.<br>    Tell her that your armpits smell bad soon after you wash them.<br>   When you say this then your can go on to the bf issue and this is when she will get up sit.<br>   Don't raise your voice and try to be totally calm.<br>   Good luck but if this don't work request a family member or her female friends to help you.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	you have a boyfriend only because he can see that you dont wear a bra and thinks you are easy. im sure he smells that you need deodorant but hes too busy looking at you not wearing a bra that he doesnt care|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Do start with the bra and deodorant. It will help ease things. If she is unwilling to admit that her baby is hitting puberty then maybe talk to an Aunt or a female family friend who can help you talk to your mother.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Find one night after your mom finishes the housework, and there are only two of you, that is the best time to talk something in your heart.|`|fAdh5BAkaa	you want to talk to mummy's|`|tlxG2q04aa	Start with the bra and deoderant.  Then introduce the idea of the make up.   The combination of a good bra, smelling nice and wearing make up will mean that a boyfriend will come along automatically.
seqEdwwnaa	i wouldnt become friends this early on...its a bad idea...give you guy space from each other....eventually being friends is a good idea just not this early|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	No. If you have dated her for a year and a half and you just recently broke up, being friends is a bad idea, and will be unhelpful to both of you. Trust me, I've gone through the same thing with different boyfriends and the most successful way of getting over someone is to stay out of contact with them. If you are friends with her, it's not going to allow you to move on, because either you or she will probably realize one or both of you still has feelings for the other.<br>  <br>  I can't say I know either of you personally obviously, but I've definitely found that even if I think I'm "over" someone, keeping in touch with them is a bad idea. I know it seems hard, but it will pass.

Don't put that pressure on one girl and yourself. You are more likely to say/act stupid with so much pressure. Just simply ask a girl out on a date, hang out with her not only as a date, do something totally fun and she how she acts. You want someone who you can have fun with. Also don't let her know right off the bat that you are sexually perverted, ease her into things and make sure then you date someone who doesn't mind... goody girls probably wont go for that...

If I were you I would hang out with him just as friends for a little, get to know him a little before you dump your BF, you might find out that the only thing this guy has going for him is his looks, so find out. Then talk to your BF about why you are fed up, try to work things out, but you are young and don't really need a BF test the waters out a little! Good luck

En mi opinion cuando tengas un poco de fuerza dejalo, porque realmente habra alguien fuera para ti, que pueda darte amor a tiempo completo, compartir su vida contigo y formar una familia a tu lado. <br>  <br>  Suerte, ciao!|`|4KT1fF8saa	No pues no hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver, y por lo que veo tu no te quieres dar cuenta que la enga?ada no es la esposa si no tú, ahorita dices estar muy felíz por que solo han pasado 7 meses, y lo que tu tienes aunque lo disfraces de muchos matices es pasión, pero esperate a que se te vaya bajando la pasión, cuan en verdad ya quieras tener un hijo y ser una mujer estable, entonces si que vas a sufrir, ahorita no te importa compartirlo pero si te llegas a embarazar que friega le vas a ponder  a ese hijo, pues recuerda que no hay ningun metodo que sea 100% seguro así que piensa que haras cuando te embaraces y él siga casado, en fin si no quieres pensar en el futuro no pienses, pero no por dejar de pensar en el quiere decir que no llegara, en fin, espero que pienses bien y que razones por tu propio bien, pues dices que ya había otra antes que tu con la que enga?o a su mujer, eso quiere decir que su naturaleza es de hombre infiel, asi que tu no tienes garantia de que a ti no te haga lo mismo aun siendo su amante!!! uuuy!! eso duele, aguas!!! por que tu estas sembrando infidelidad para tu vida y vas a recibir lo mismo.

Deberías de mostrarle estas respuestas que te estamos dando para que les sirva de ayuda.<br>  <br>  Nadie en el mundo tiene derecho de quitarse su vida y menos por otra persona que no supo valorar su amor. Dile que fue mejor que la descubriera, que estar pasando la vida entera al lado de una mujer que no vale la pena. Ya encontrará a otra que si sepa valorarlo como hombre y recibir y respetar todo el amor que él tiene para dar.<br>  <br>  Aconsejale que se ponga mejor, se vista mejor, se cambie el corte de cabello, para cuando la estu.pida esa lo vuelva a ver vea lo que perdio, a un hombre buenmozo y bueno. Y en cambio si continua deprimido y poniendose peor ella se reira de él. No vale la pena esa mujer ni nadie para que tome tu amigo esa decisión. Todo en la vida pasa por algo y a tu amigo le toco, para que se diera cuenta de que su novia no valia la pena, como mujer por sinver.guenza.Mas bien debería de sentirse feliz de haberla descubierto y no andar con un tipo de mujer así.<br>  <br>  A veces tenemos que conocer a muchas personas equivocadas para cuando llegue la correcta sepamos valorarla más.<br>  <br>  Dile que sea fuerte, y que yo le envio energias positivas y le cuento que pero fue lo que me hicieron a mi, tenia 4 a?os con mi novio, nos eramos felicices, pero se acostó con otra y la dejo embarazada y ya teniamos todo listo para nuestra boba. Imaginate como me puedo sentir yo???? mal, triste, pero jamas me quitaria la vida por otro que no supo respetar mi amor y mucho menos mi confianza. Me mato mis ilusiones que tenia para con él, pero no todas las demás. Aun tengo vida y espero encontrar a otro hombre que no me defraude. Cuentale o muestrale esta respuesta. Para que aprenda a valorarse y a estimarse él antes de poder querer a los demás. él como hombre lo que se siente es herido y traicionado en su hombria pero no debe de caer en eso.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Adrian me encantó tu pregunta, en lo particular me encanta un hombre que sea honesto, delicado, inteligente, cari?oso, que tenga buen sentido del humor y me haga reir, fiel, que sea elegante no solo al vestir sino en toda su personalidad y por sobre todo que no sea mentiroso, que seamos sinceros los dos y  que sea mi compa?ero, amigo, amante, novio y si podemos también ser esposos y compartir nuestras vidas juntos, y tener compa?erismo en todo.<br>  <br>  Pero en especial para mi lo más importante sería la química, el feeling,la conexión, una excelente comunicacion, que sepan de que hablar y que siempre encuentren un tema de conversación, el respeto mutuo y la admiración mutua. También me gusta un hombre que sea trabajador que le guste crecer profesionalmente y como ser humano y que nos apoyemos en nuestros proyectos y metas que tengamos para crecer juntos....eso sería lo ideal en una pareja para mi y pienso que para todos....unir nuestras almas en una sola..<br>  <br>  Ya me llegará ese hombre maravilloso que tenemos todas en el mundo y a ustedes esas mujeres que también se merecen a sus lados. <br>  <br>  Pienso que al lado de cada gran hombre existe una gran mujer, y no atráz como dice ese refrán...<br>  <br>  Que mi pareja me represente siempre y que igualmente yo a él...eso sería lo genial en toda pareja...<br>  <br>  Respetarse sus espacios, no agobiarse uno al otro y tratar de mantener la relación activa y no caer en la rutina diaria..sino ser inventivos, amorosos, comunicativos, respetuosos y ten por seguro que eso mantendría la relación estable....ah se me olvidaba y tambien una buena relación sexual y también ser inventivos para no caer también en la rutina sexual.<br>  <br>  Creo que exigi mucho verdad jejeje pero de que se puede se puede si los dos quieren y aman.<br>  <br>  Besitos y suerte en con tu pareja...<br>  <br>  YO AúN ESTOY EN LA ESPERA DE ESE SER MARAVILLOSO QUE LLEGARá A MI, PARA RECIBIR Y DAR AMOR.

Por otra parte la mujer busca al mejor, al numero uno, a la mujer le gusta admirar mientras que al hombre le gusta ser admirado. Actualmente hay mas mujeres exitosas y por tanto exigentes, ellas lo quieren todo. Hay quienes dicen que la mujer es un ser inconforme, porque parece que nunca es suficiente para ella, las rubias quieren ser morenas y viceversa.<br>  <br>  Una universidad de los EEUU,  hizo un estudio u una porción de la población femenina y determino que de hecho a las mujeres les gusta una clase diferente de hombre dependiendo de su ciclo menstrual (QUE TAL??), dicho estudio demostró que durante los días que los cuales la mujer esta ovulando (Etapa de fertilidad), prefería a hombre con rostros de rasgos fuertes, grueso y varoniles, que instintivamente era una se?al de que contenían un mayor cantidad de testosterona, sin embargo antes y después de dicho periodo, preferían a hombres con rostros mas amables, con rasgos mas suaves y delicados,  es decir mas femeninos. Todo esto debido a que las mujeres instintivamente sabían que hombres con mayor carga de testosterona tienden a ser mas promiscuos. Mientras que los hombres con menor cantidad de testosterona en sus cuerpos resultaban ser mucho mas confiables para criar auna familia.|`|f2y382XLaa	Yo no sabía pero Lucem me acaba de poner en un nivel superior, con razón me es tan díficil encontrar una buena pareja y eso que soy bonita.<br>  Es cierto, depende del tipo de mujer, sus aspiraciones, valores e intereses.<br>  Yo por ejemplo pido tener buena comunicación, que el hombre exprese sus sentimientos y sepa escuchar. Que me respete, me brinde confianza, apoyo emocional, intelectual y espiritual, que comparta metas conmigo o por lo menos no interfiera en ellas. Que no compita conmigo, que sea positivo, con autoestima. Que me brinde seguridad emocional y que tenga estabilidad económica. No significa que me mantenga como reina, pero que no pretenda administrar lo que yo he hecho bien por a?os. Que tenga metas y ambiciones.<br>  También tiene que ver con la edad, en los 20's sólo pedía alguien que se viera decente físicamente, que me amara mucho y que fuera inteligente.

Es tan intenso este lenguaje que hasta la forma de tomar las rosas o de entregarlas, tiene su propio significado, si se entregan con la mano derecha contienen más intensidad y si se reciben con esta misma mano, significa que hay aceptación. Este lenguaje suele ser un poco más complicado a medida que se intercalan las diferentes flores y los colores, como puedes ver, éste es uno de los lenguajes más exquisitos y enriquecedores que podemos utilizar para comunicarnos.<br>  A continuación algunos significados de acuerdo al color de las rosas: <br>  La rosa roja significa /Amor Pasional/ Te amo/ Felicidades/ Un trabajo bien hecho...<br>  La rosa blanca significa /Pureza/ Guardar un secreto/ Inocencia/ Juventud /Te merezco...<br>   La rosa sonia significa /Permanezcamos juntos /Sellar un pacto...<br>  La rosa rosa significa /Felicidad Perfecta /Dulzura, Suavidad /Por favor, créeme...<br>  La rosa amarilla significa /Regocijo /Felicidad /Me importas /Una bienvenida /Amistad /Recuérdame /Celos<br>  Las rosas rojas junto a rosas blancas o las rosas blancas con bordes rojos significan "Unión".<br>  Las rosas anaranjadas o coral significan "Deseo".<br>  Una sóla rosa significa "Simplicidad".<br>  Las rosas de colores pasteles significan "Amistad".<br>  Los ramos simbolizan belleza, juventud e inocencia.<br>  Los ramos de rosas blancas simbolizan ni?ez, inocencia.<br>  Los ramos de rosas rojas simbolizan "Pureza".<br>  Un ramo cubierto con musgo simboliza una "Confesión de amor".<br>  Una rosa abierta colocada junto a dos capullos simbolizan un "Secreto".<br>  Las hojas simbolizan la "Esperanza".<br>  Las rosas rojas oscuras (vino o rojo escarlata) significan "Belleza Interior". <br>  Una o un ramo:<br>  La cantidad de flores no tiene nada que ver con el cari?o que te profesen. Una sola rosa, una sola, puede implicar mayor complicidad que una ramo de dos docenas. Además, la gratitud de esa persona hacia a ti se hará patente con este bello detalle.<br>  Si quieres mostrarle a uno de tus amigos el cari?o que le tienes o hacerle ver tu gratitud por un favor prestado, no dudes en ofrecerle una rosa. Si un buen día te levantas y te das cuenta de lo importante qué es para ti tu madre, no esperes a que llegue su santo. Puedes regalarle un bonito ramo de rosas. Lo agradecerá enormemente. <br>  Las rosas rojas:<br>  "Te quiero". Esto es lo que desean decirte si te envían rosas rojas. Se trata de uno de los colores más excitantes y si el encarnado es el de la flor, lo que significa es pasión, emoción e incluso peligro. <br>  Las rosas rojas no sólo son símbolo del amor, un simple amigo te las puede enviar haciendo halago a la belleza y al respeto que os une. <br>  Pero sobre todo son las jóvenes enamorados los que escogen este color de rosa para demostrar a su pareja lo mucho que la quieren. No olvides que es una fuerte pasión la que los une.<br>  Las rosas blancas:<br>  "Celestial y pura". Así te ven si te regalan un ramo de rosas blancas. Lo que te une a esa persona puedes asegurar que va a durar toda la vida. Por eso, son las novias las que eligen este color para su ramo de flores el día de la boda. <br>   Si una persona muy cercana está enferma no dudes que este es el color de la flor que el debes llevar. A parte de llenar de vida el cuarto donde esté, le demostrarás que estás ahí para todo lo que necesite. <br>  Sin embargo, las rosas blancas también están unidas al amor. Una pareja que ha cumplido sus bodas de oro puede regalarle a su pareja un enorme ramo de este tipo de flor. Significa amor puro, feliz y para siempre. Es una apuesta por un futuro sólido entre ambos. <br>  Las rosas rosas:<br>  "Gracias". Regalarte una flor rosa es una forma indirecta de agradecerte ese favor tan importante que has hecho. También significa el aprecio que te tienen. No dudes en ser tu el primero que obsequies este bonito detalle a ese amigo que siempre está incondicionalmente a tu lado. <br>  Si el color del ramo de flores es rosa suave, significa admiración y simpatía. Se lo puedes regalar a esa persona que te ha robado el corazón y que todavía no conoce tus sentimientos. <br>  La persona que te ofrezca este ramo de flores es de fiar. El rosa lleva consigo el significa de ausencia de maldad. Es decir, no hay ninguna doble intención en la persona que te las ofrezca. <br>  Las rosas amarillas<br>  "Ten cuidado".

Puede estar celosa de ti o descubrir ante este regalo su egoísmo.<br>   Sin embargo, para la gente que escéptica, las rosas amarillas significan satisfacción y alegría.

La bondad y pureza con el amor. <br>  Si las rosas rojas van unidas de las amarillas lo que vas a enviar es un mensaje que transmita jovialidad y felicidad.

Ese dia de la pelicula vistete lo mejor que puedas, cambia de corte de cabello, ponte un perfume rico y tratala como una reina sin necesidad de decirle que te gusta o la amas. A veces las acciones hacen más que mil palabras.<br>  <br>  Acuerdate que en los sentimientos no se manda. Solo deja que fluya a ver que ocurre.

Sabes, yo deje a un hombre que amaba y amo aún, pero que las circunstancias me obligaron a dejarlo partir y alejarme. Es duro, pero cuando algo no puede ser no debemos obligar la situación sino dejar todo al tiempo y las heridas poco a poco se sanarán. Dejala que recapacite y ella solita si te ama, volverá a ti.

La verdad que si ami me interesara todabia no me gustaria mucho escuchar que a estado con todo el Vesindario.<br>  Saludos.
EapqkjqJaa	Mira, algo my parecido me pasó hace un a?o nadamás que yo estaba en tu lugar y el chico que me gustaba no era mi super amigo, sólo nos hablabamos por lo de la escuela... total que para no hacer el cuento más largo, un día yo le dí a entender que me gustaba pero yo no sabía si le gustaba a él y comenzé a salir con un chico...upps!!! ERROR! él igual comenzó a salir con un tipa del salón y hasta se hicieron novios!!! jojo! y yo me quedé como mensa bueno unos cuantos días porque despues cortaron y llevo 9 felices meses de relación con mi chico!! ah! por cierto él es muy reservado y serio, así que a esas personas hay qeu tratarlas bien porque suelen ser muy valiosas y no se andan con jueguitos de celos, no digo que a ti te suceda lo mismo pero por lo menos yo te recomiendo que la trates un poco más y no intentes besarla, al menos que ella no te lo insinue!<br>  Suerte y el que se debe de poner las pilas eres tú!!|`|HHqXdaLdaa	Me parece que eres demasiado inseguro e inmaduro para llevar una relación formal y a las mujeres no les gusta que los hombres sean así, madura primero, no seas ni?o, da la impresión que no sabes ni lo que quieres <br>  <br>  No quise ofenderte, solo quise dar un punto de vista, según tus comentarios.<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte|`|a3bd010ce2c45864e63bc68026dfbed0aa	el 1 y el 5 es lo más probable, pero si es inteligente asi como lo dices, lo mas logico entonces seria el 2..<br>  Suerte.<br>  <br>  x)|`|c7Qd8aiyaa	La número 3, suerte matador.|`|PGeyPXhtaa	bueno mi prima es asi seria y un poco desconfiada , yo seguiria con ella , pero si vas a salir con otra persona y ella se entere creo que no lo hara por despecho , porque si es desconfiada quizas no encuentre con quien hacerlo , quizas tome la opcion 1 o la opcion 4. Suerte con las dos jaja|`|Y5FkeJSgaa	Bueno en primer lugar si te interesa la chica, no busques a nadie mas hasta no saber como sigue la cosa con ella, ahora si te pela pues sale con la otra chava pero has las cosas bien, no vayas a salir a comer aun restaurante a donde ella siempre va, o pasarte frente a su casa....|`|elLSuzyDaa	lo que debes de analizar es te gusta? te interesa? si tus respuestas son si, entonces por lo que te pregunto ella a leguas se nota que tu si le interesas no seas tonto ya avientate ya cantasela dile que si quiere andar contigo y no le des mas vueltas al asunto<br>  avientate con todo|`|fbopOGl3aa	Amigo, te sugiero que analices qué es lo que tú quieres.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Que te puedo decir???' que te des a respetar tu vales mucho y no permitas que ningún hombre que sea tu novio o pareja se deje besar por otras delante de ti. Yo en tu caso le llamaría la atención tanto a tu y que amiga y a tu novio. ESO SE LLAMA FALTA DE RESPETO. Y tu no te mereces eso.<br>  <br>  El que sea tu novio ahora no significa que te dejes irrespetar, ya encontrarás a otro que si te valore como mujer y te respete delante de otras personas.<br>  <br>  Si hiso eso ahora, que puedes esperar para más adelante???? cortalo ya o le das un ultimatum o te respeta o se va. Ya encontrarás a otros que si te VALOREN.<br>  <br>  Cuidate y no te pongas triste y arriba ese ánimo ok, nada ni nadie se merece tus lágrimas ni sufrimientos. El mundo está afuera esperando por ti y muchos hombres buenos también. Lo que no sirve ni te deja nada bueno ni positivo SE BOTA.|`|e331edb7b0526b2d17c526dc9e65427baa	Que esperas?  eso no sirve botalooooooooooo como un perro.|`|GPurzvr5aa	primero aprende a escribir por q no te entiendo pero ps lo q te estoy tratando de entender como q te da picones y ps aparte q esas no son amigas|`|XikLudkfaa	La verdad....DEJALO!

AA11458134	ditch him! obviously he just wants to have sex with you, then dump you. just look at how long you've been 2gether. less than a month! i know it wont be easy, but forget him and wait for a real guy who loves you.
6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Si no la penetraste sin condón es imposible que tengas HIV o Sindrome de Inmunodeficiencia adquirida.<br>  <br>  Por lo del dolor de estómago debe de ser otra cosa, visita al gastroenterologo quien te podrá decir que te callo mal. <br>  <br>  Y en cuanto a lo que le hiciste en sus senos, tal vez tenia algo y te lo pegó. Visita también a un médico especialista en los hombres que no se como se llama jejej o a un dermatólogo quien te dirá que es lo que tienes en la boca.<br>  <br>  Para la próxima cuidate mejor no las beses ni le ma.mes NADAAAAAAAAAA o buscate a una novia que sea limpia y estas con ella, no necesitas de estar con ese tipo de mujeres.<br>  <br>  Pero acuerdate que el SIDA se contagia solamente con fluidos líquidos despedidos por el organismo y por penetración. <br>  <br>  Suerte. Y las manifestaciones del SIDA no son tan rápidas los sintomas aparecen despues de varios a?os...así que haste el examen de ELISA dentro de un a?o...pero no te asustes si no eres promiscuo y no andas por ahí como loco, quedate tranquilo y piensa bien con el tipo de mujer que te acuestes ok. Acuerdate que no solo el SIDA puedes contraer sino otro tipo de infecciones venéreas como el Sífiles, la gonorrea, etc.|`|d7a25bea968217c4b2f6433d9e4e1917aa	Puede ser sífilis por los síntomas en la boca. Ve a un médico urgentemente y evita el contacto con cosas que usen los demás para no contaminarlas.|`|0whHnwXWaa	o dios mio estas enfectado... vas a morir no mueras por fa yo te quiero...aiiiiiiiiiiiii...|`|KALnJi1taa	quedate tranquilo, anda al medico y lo hablas con el.<br>  Si  no hubo penetracion sin condon y no practicaste sexo oral, no pasa nada con el SIDA.<br>  Pero seguro la mina teniaa algo en las tet@s .<br>  Anda al medico, lo mas pronto posible.|`|UOLdcYfGaa	Hola a no desesperar el VIH no tiene esos síntomas. Lo primero q puedes hacer es ir hacerte unos estudios son gratuitos en cualquier hospital. Charlarlo con alguien de confianza "que sea mayor" pero no te preocupes sera por es la primera vez q vas a esos lugares?? o hay algo mas q paso y tenes miedo de decirlo??  en fin a no desesperar es bueno q te preocupes pero la próxima anda a lugares mas seguros o mejor ni vallas. Es tu salud pero por el sexo oral no hay contagio si no hay lastimaduras y menos por una mordedura simple.  tiene q haber contacto de sangre para q pase.. y si tuviste sexo y no verificaste el condón muy mal. pero bueno muy pocas veces se rompe casi nunca, es muy raro.  no te preocupes mas, sácate la duda yendo a un profesional o con un mayor de confianza.  Mucha suerte|`|cqH3ZTJGaa	no amigo no te pasa nada estas bien lo que pasa es que estas pensando solo en eso es como psicologico de la manera como te puedes contagiar es que tengas relaciones con una prosti, sin condon por lo general en esos lugares las prostis siempre estan hasta el chongo de condones y nunca lo hacen sin condon y por otro medio es por la sangre que te inyectes con una geringa usada por otra persona como es el caso de las drogas que se inyectan un pokito y luego se la pasan al otro hasta que se la acaban. no tienes nada ve con el doc. y haste un chequeo pero si tuvieras vih no se te va a declarar en un mes es muy pronto. cuidate mucho y protegete los viscochos son muy ricos pero muy peligrosos destrozan familias dinero hogares dejan a uno sin billetes en fin lo que hacemos algunos por una nalguita no es mi caso aclaro no tengo necesidad pero mano no vayas a esos lugares tanta nena linda que anda pidiendo a gritos y ahora nos tocan mas por las que nos estan dejando los pu?ales!
