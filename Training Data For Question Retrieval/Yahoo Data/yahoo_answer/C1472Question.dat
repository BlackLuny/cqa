20090203100244AA9o2iC	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How can I deal with mean people?	My boyfriend tells me I'm too sensitive, usually just after he says something mean. This morning I said I was going to treat myself to a slice of pizza because I did well on my exam. He went into a long diatribe about how bad pizza is for me. When I said it was only one piece, and I like it, and deserve a treat - he said I had a bad attitude and was too sensitive. Oh, yeah, he's on a new diet - that doesn't include pizza, even though he doesn't like it. Do I just never tell him anything? Or say, 'well, ouch.' Do I assume that if someone tells me I'm oversensitive, that it's because they're justifying being mean?

I do on the other hand ask that you can name a discrimination you have witnessed or even been a victim of. Also what do you find to be the 3 biggest discrimination's homosexuals face. Don't say marriage because that is obvious. I'm sorry if I come across too demanding in my question, but if I don't clarify my question will never be answered and just be filled with bigotry.

If you make several requests to talk to the imam, telling him you have some disabilities you need to discuss with him, and he ignores your requests and shows absolutely zero interest in making you feel welcome at the mosque, is that a glaring sign that it is not a good mosque, not a good ummah, and you are better to stay and pray at home?

20090203100534AAa0g5l	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it right to say the N-Word?	Personally I think it is ok for anyone to say. We have freedom of speech in this country so anyone can say anything no matter what. I've heard people say that it is a hurtful word, but if it is then that means it's hurtful no matter who says it. It is used all the time in rap songs. I mean you never hear mexicans calling each other wetbacks or chinese calling each other chincs. So why do black people insist on using the N-word even if it is "offensive"? I will continue to use any word i feel like no matter what anyone says. What are your opinion on this word?

Many see putting everyone on a same government health-care system as a solution.      Others think that a competitive free-market approach as a solution that would keep prices low, and result in better service.       And some think a simple price-ceiling on insurance corporations+ drug costs would do the trick.      Note: What we've had in the past years was not a true free-market, just to put that out there.

20090219182630AADjc01	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Being taken to small claims court over gifts given to me for my baby?	My ex and I broke up a few days ago. We had been dating about four months. I am 36 weeks pregnant and he gave me a stroller and baby swing for christmas for a total of around $400. I never asked for or expected these things.      When we broke up he sent me a text stating I could "buy" them from him. Later when I didn't respond he texted "nevermind I'm going to sell them."      I had a key to his place and I went today to gather my stuff that I had there as well as return the keys. He was not there and I got my shoes and CD, as well as the two christmas gifts. I left the keys and went home.      Later when he got hom he called and left a message that he's going to file a police report because I "stole" the baby items from him.      I didn't respond and a few hours later he sent a formal email "attempting settlement" that the items were "Originally purchased as a gift for your unborn child..." and asking me to split the exact cost of the items and I I didn't pay him he would take me to small claims court.      I broke up with him two weeks ago for a day and during that time offered to give him some money for them through text. He wrote "it's not about the money I don't want to lose you" back. Can he use the text to say I was supposed to pay him even though we got back together and he admitted they were gifts today?      Does he have a chance? He has no children of his own and admitted in writing they were a gift.
20090219181848AAbnTtc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do creationists falsely give people the impression that they have to choose between science and their God?	...Of course, if someone has been born within a Christian (or other faith) home, inside a Christian community, goes to Church every Sunday and has raised his children in a Christian way... if you tell them that they can't have both at the same time, it's obvious who they will pick!      But, isn't that a very twisted and underhanded thing to do? Isn't it as twisted as telling people they have to choose between their God and a Round Earth?      Don't Creationist also purposely misinform people (especially children) on what a "Theory" really is? (as opposed to a hypothesis) ... All in the purpose of people agreeing with them, rather than be concerned about the truth?      Shouldn't religions try to adapt to new knowledge, rather than try to squeeze that knowledge into what they believe in?      Not all religions do this: the Catholic church has already gracefully accepted the idea of Evolution and even the Origin of life (they now mostly stick to the idea that God planned the Big Bang like a Master Cueist... the Earth being the 8-ball, of course)      Don't religious leaders have a responsibility to make sure that their followers can differentiate their personal beliefs from everything else (psychology, sexology, psychiatry, astronomy, biology, archeology... and even nutrition)?      Shouldn't religion be humble enough to accept that the entire universe can't be contained in a few thousand pages?

Before I start if you don't wanna read it all, please do it for me because it is really important to me.      Okay there's this guy who works in the mall and I really like him and I think he likes me also but I would like if someone could help me figure out somethings about him:      1. Whenever I go to the mall to see him we always have good conversation about different things.   2. He walked close up on me a few times and tried to play it off but I knew what he was trying to do.   3. I caught him taking a glance at my butt a couple of times.   4. Every time I talk with him he always would smile and stare me in the eyes like he's interested in me.   5. Like 2 times whenever I would see him he shook my hands 3 TIMES, once was when I said I had to go, then I stayed a couple of minutes then said I had to go again and we shook hands again, and last but not least he told to MEET HIM AGAIN THE NEXT DAY and we shook hands again. Now come on now what straight guy would shake another guy's hand that much in under 5 minutes?   6. Now this is a very major one. On Valentines Day that just passed I went there to see him again and I know he was happy cause I could see it in his eyes. So we got to talking and stuff and then at 6:00 p.m. he left his register to clock out and I was happy because we could be close by each other. So after he clocked out he asked what I was doing tonight (ON VALENTINES DAY NEED I REMIND YOU) and I said probably go to a parade (We live in Louisiana), so he said oh ok. Then It happen.....      ....Before he was about to leave two things happened he shook my hands and came up on me like he was going to hug me, and yes I was shocked.      Then before he left I said, " Well hey let me give you my number", and he said YES (YAYYYYY). So after I said that he said, "Well let me give you my number instead", probably wanted to feel like the dominant one. So we exchanged numbers and then that was a wrap I was so happy that night, did I say it was on Valentine's Day?      So let me know what you think about him is he into me or what.

20090219181332AA56yAd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question about spirits?	okay this is awkward and when i tell people they think im crazy. ive had previous happening with ghosts i think? im not sure what to say to describe it.      but at my house i was reading about ouija boards to use and build one, i was reading about it and all the sudden i felt a force and then it felt like someone went and shot me and i couldnt see for two minutes then i started seeing colored blocks and then everything got clear and i saw myself differently in the mirror.      and a few days ago at my dads:   ive noticed whenever i go to put things in my closet i feel someone pushing me and then i hear someone say GO and i get pushed out and then the night that happened i was sitting on my bed, the heat was at 60 degrees and it said 80 on the bottom, i felt the same push and i felt a cold presence in my hands and they were right by the heater. i heard a squeel and i went upstairs into my dads room and i closed the door and it opened again (not lying) so i went to talk to my dads gf and she tried to scare them away but they werent leaving me alone and she blessed a glass of water and put it in the corners of my room and on my forehead will this make them go away because im terrified and i keep hearing abnormal noises and ive noticed that when i put a deck of cards on a table it ends up on my dads desk and i keep hearing MOVE, LEAVE ect.

I am not sure if what I am asking for is clear, I basically want suggestions as to what I could learn that would be valuable to me in my life. For example, cooking, driving, accounting, the ability to socialise.

20090219185957AABRM2E	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of this dream I had?	I was setting in a closed class room where we were taught that nothing exists outside of the school. The air was stale the seats hard and the windows were covered with a film that you  could not see out of. We were told that the outside was were death was and if we went outside we would surly die.      I was not paying attention to what the teacher was saying and glanced toward the window and thought I saw some kind of movement.    I ran over to the window and tried to scrub some of the film off. I saw a blurred image of children playing in fields of flowers. I was immediately jerked back to my seat and reminded their was nothing outside of this classroom and nothing worth being taught that was not taught here.    I waited and when the time was right I made a bolt for the door I was caught but managed to get free. As I ran for the door I could hear the other kids crying for my safety. I busted through the doors and it was as I had seen it. I breathed in the fresh air for the first time and saw the beauty of a new and colorful world. I ran to the window and could see in but they could not see out. It was if I had never left all eyes were on the teacher. I waved my hands excitedly and finally one child thought she saw movement.

INTRO:   When the parents tell you to not fall under pressure,    Sometimes it’s so hard when you want to impress her.   When hangin’ out with the guys,    They roll up that blunt,    You want to be cool in their eyes.      CHORUS:   Watch my chest heave,    As this last breathe leaves me.    Cuz I’m trying to be,    What you’re dying to see.   This is not what I need,    I’m only 15.      VERSE I:   He takes one more hit,   To get high off this ****.   Even though he don’t drink,    They push him to the brink,    By the end of the night,   Vomits flooding the sink.    His moms crying on the door,    As she finds him on the floor.      CHORUS:   Watch my chest heave,    As this last breathe leaves me.    Cuz I’m trying to be,    What you’re dying to see.   This is not what I need,   I’m only 15.      VERSE II:   He begs and he pleas,    To get her on her knees.   She knows she not ready,    He says he only wants head he,    Knows he wants more.   She starts to get nervous, as he locks up the door.      CHORUS      VERSE III:   She finally agrees,    To get down on her knees.   This was three months ago,    The kids at school call her a slut and a hoe.   It could’ve been worse,    If his rubber had burst.      CHORUS      VERSE IIII:   Pressure from peers can be a dangerous thing,    And the resulting pain,    Ain’t worth playing that game.   Whether it be drugs or sex,    You can make sure one bet,   You’ll forever be changed,    For thinking pressure’s a game.      CHORUS X2

20090219183927AA2xdpi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Different views of Heaven/Hell from different Christians?	I was brought up Christian by my parents, and I was taught that you only go to Hell if you are truly evil and do harm. Like, my parents always told me that people go to Heaven if they have done good deeds on this earth, and that there are many religions and beliefs that can lead a person to Heaven. So this is more of an intentions-centered belief; your actions matter more than your ultimate religious or spiritual beliefs.      But lately, I've encountered certain Christians who say that your actions on this earth don't matter; it's down to whether or not you believe God sent Jesus to be a savior for humankind, and whether or not you repent to God and Jesus. So, for example, this belief is stating that if you are a Buddhist who has done more good than bad in their life, they do to hell since A) they don't believe that Jesus of Nazareth is their savior and B) They have not necessarily repented to God/Jesus for their sins, though they have helped humanity in general.      So my questions are A) Am I correct in what I'm saying with these two distinct views and   B) Does anyone have an idea of which belief about Heaven/Hell is more popular among Christians?      Thanks in advance!! And please no bashing/trying to convert me to a religion/trying to convince me of one of these two beliefs; I merely want to understand. =)
20090219185548AAaKmPv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Gay Adoption-What's best for the kids?	Personally I'm straight but have absolutely nothing wrong with LGBT community-- my last boyfriend was bisexual and my best friend is gay. I advocate for equal rights, but when it comes to gay adoption I have to question if having two fathers or two mothers really what is best for the child. I understand that many children would not have home-lives without such adoptions but please hear me out.   With the climbing number of divorces it is mentioned over and over again how having both a strong male and female role model for a child is critical for their well being, some I as a child of divorce, strongly believe. I am in no way stating that a person is an unfit parent due to their sexuality but I have to question if is the best thing for a child if there is not going to be a strong influence from the opposing couple.    I am very interested in hearing your thoughts, please do bear in mind that I don't mean any disrespect toward anyone who is looking to or has already adopted.

20090219184920AAc3leq	Society & Culture;Languages	Can you check my grammar?	Dear Ms. 000:      I received your letter and I’m very glad to have a chance to know about you more.    Now I know that you had been majoring to theatre arts and why I really liked your accents and tones when you read the book for us in class.   As you said, we will be spending next few months together, so I want to introduce myself too.       At first, my favorite class is Japanese. It’s very fun that Japan and my country have a lot of similar words and traditions. Besides the Japanese, I like to learn any foreign languages because I feel so proud when somebody who speaks other language understands what I’m saying. From learning languages, I not only learn about individual person, but also about their cultures. I love traveling and that is also one of the many reasons I’m interested in learning the languages. However, I don’t really like histories and I wonder why because it’s also about learning about other countries. Probably because it sometimes conveys the conflicts, wars, and compromises and these are too complicated that makes me headache. I love the teachers in this class, though.      I’m willing to go to the 000 University one year and a few months later, so I’m preparing for the tests. If possible, I want to major in journalism since I like writing. I like when we have the writing assignments in US history class because it will later help me a lot. I will do my best in this class and in 000 high school to achieve my goal.

I was just wondering if anyone could share some information, or point me in the direction of a website with information on the following things:      - The stakeholders (groups) involved in this 'issue'   - A number of court cases on the issue   - Current laws against it   - How it impacts the common good   - and What individual rights it address.      And yes, I do realize it looks like I'm asking for you do practically do the project for me, but it's really not that, I'm just looking for further information and conformation of what I already have.      I hope you all have a wonderful day.   :)

If its a grocery store or a store like Best Buy, it will look unprofessional to just volunteer there without being employed.

20090219214515AAGQ7Zk	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Should I do anything about her?	Now this is only for those whom know spirits are real. You can say they don't exist all you want, whatever, enjoy your two points but I have enough proof not to be interested in conversion.      Ok so my house is haunted but not in a bad way. We've just moved in a few months ago. We used to have a cheeky spirit who stole our things and played around with the electricity and radios. He used to scare my cats and stomp up and down the hall creating a fuss. My boyfriend basically 'told it off' one night after I had been frightened and he left and all our stuff returned mysteriously. It's been great ever since.      However there's another one. It haunts my parents bedroom. It's not a bad one, my mother says it's like an older woman. She says she can feel it sit on the bed at night gently and when we went to a psychic [and said nothing about it] the psychic said it was my mother's great grandmother who was watching over my older baby brother who passed away.       Fair enough but what should I do.. she has been frightening myself and the cats today. I was watching a movie and I heard my parents bed creak loudly. I've been hearing soft footsteps in the ol' hall haha all day. A handprint was on mums mirror which was way too thin to be anyones in the family.  Plus no one is home but me.      Should I tell someone and should we try and usher her to the light or is she ok? Because she has never done much movement like this. I only recall feeling her presence in my parents room [before mum mentioned she feels her there too]      Or should I just leave her. I've had bad experiences with ghosts before so I am unsure about it all..

The earth shook, rocks split apart, 52 and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead 53 after Jesus' resurrection. They left the cemetery, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.

20090219195317AAlQdqW	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why does society obsess over relationships?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?

Like if you're a woman, you know you're not supposed to go outside of the house without somebody, and you know you're not supposed to talk to other non family guys. But some do and get killed for it.       And they know that they're not supposed to be committing adultery or saying that they got raped if there were no witnesses around, yet they do it anyway and get killed. And if you're a daughter, you know that you're not supposed to be trying to talk to boys.          So why do some women in Islamic countries continue to do things that they know will get them killed?

20090219220630AAIV8c5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is missionary work considered non-christian?	I hear a lot of people bad mouth mormons because they go door to door (not always) to invite people to hear their message of christ. FYI they usually work and save up thousands so they can support themselves for these 2 years so money isnt obviously a driving factor for them. Didnt christ with his apostles teach the gospel to all people they encountered and went town to town preaching? Even after christ died paul and the others were zealous missionaries trying to convert people of the truth. They suffered some of the same type of persecutions that missionaries do today. Its obvious to me that its almost a repeat of what was going on in the biblical days. Just something to think about

In response to the amount of drivel posted in response to       http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...       According to Darwin evolution occurred through natural selection, that means only the fittest survive and reproduce. Those that are not fit die and fail to reproduce. However we all know that nowadays most people survive and if they wish reproduce, this means that the natural selection part now does not apply, hence evolution as has occurred up until now cannot continue and we may even devolve.    So please explain according to the theory how we are still evolving?
20090219195942AAlDCsW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Gay guys, would you do this, its not dirty?	Alright so I'm openly gay and am joining the military in 8 months. I'll be living in barracks, which are small little rooms like in college, unless I get married. I want to get married so I can live in a house on or off base instead of the little rooms. The only problem is if I find the right girl I cant marry her because the military is against gays, as you probably know.      So my idea was to marry a guy to get housing. I dont want to marry a straight guy, cause he'll want to have girls over or he'll want to how shall I say "get some". So I want to marry a gay guy, that way no possibility of a real relationship. And gay guys are just a lot more fun to hang out with, at least ones that I've met.      I want to know would you marry me? You'd be living on base with me, I'd have rent covered, food allowance, you'd get all sorts of benefits, and more.      This question isnt to find someone to marry. I just want to know if you would.

20090219190858AAPbXyi	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Are African Americans offended by this attitude?	I read a book called "Cop In The Hood" which is about a White Ivy League Graduate Student who takes a job policing in Baltimore. Being my original hometown, I could relate a lot to what the White Cops in the book felt especially given the fact that it took place in the Eastern District which is not too far from where I grew up. So the Eastern District is 97% African American and as the author describes it has every problem you can expect to find in a majority African American ghetto to the tenth power. Anyway, the author accuses another White Cop half jokingly of disliking African Americans and the other White Cop says-      "No, I just hate THESE Black People. If it was White People who acted this way I'd probably hate them even more."      So I am wondering, are African Americans offended by cops who say they don't like African Americans in the sense that cop said it? I mean that cop isn't refering to all African Americans, he is refering to a specific group of African Americans who most of the African American police officers he works with describe as "lazy, welfare dependent, baby producing, crack smoking, drug dealing, cop hating drunks."

20090219192236AACQG1U	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think this could work?	The dorm I am going to be staying in doesn't allow pets, Its a small college. I have a chihuahua and she cant stay with my parents, I'm not getting rid of her, and I am not boarding her or fostering.      She is very very quiet, very obedient, she is trained very will by my self, she has never crapped or peed in my house or anywhere else. She is very social and kind to everyone unless you are mean to her. But she doesn't bite she actually has never bitten anyone. She doesn't jump on people or scratch. I keep her very clean by washing her once or twice a week. I keep her toe nails clipped. I even brush her teeth every other day. Its amazing that I find the time to do all of this.      My idea is to debate with the dorm directors, I take Zami (chihuahua) in with me for a meeting about this and show them how such good behavior she has. When they told me that they didn't allow animals, I asked why and they didn't tell me anything other than allergies, and I could pay extra to not be roomed with not allergenic. And the other reason they mentioned was cleanliness and I would tell them how well I keep her.

20090219210145AAoVAI4	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Sex and, racial roll playing??? TOO Weird or, is it OK?	Ok I'm only 20 and, I've just recently come out of that "infamous closet"      I'm fairly new to sex...gay sex and, I'm overly submissive...I pretty much will do anything to please others and, I'm pretty shy and timid as a person. Plus I'm a small guy.      So,...anyways....There's this black guy named Jason that has made me his "booty call"  And, he actually admits being somewhat racist but, he likes to f white boys....Which works as I have a serious case of jungle fever myself...       He's a REALLY big guy!!! Tall, strong, and aggressive!!! He's actually "BI" and, unless you knew....You would NEVER know he likes to have sex with guys...specifically white guys. He makes it a point to say he ONLY gives....NEVER EVER receives...      Which is cool Because I would never feel comfortable giving anyways ( I'm small down there). He seems TOTALLY straight and, he's actually Kinda hood-ish. He's also almost ten years older than me 2. And, very experienced!!! Any bossy!!!!!!!       I'm actually pretty afraid of him...So I pretty much say and DO ANYTHING and EVERYTHING he says...but, It IS a little weird.....First thing is...he likes to refer to himself as "The Black-Quarter back" and to me as "The White Receiver"       He even saved me in his phone that way!      I think he may be obsessed with having sex with me! He REALLY loves very white skin and, big butts (which I have very much of both) so, he wants to f me like ALL the time!!! Sometimes he makes me stay at his place for constant access and, won't really let me leave.    Which is weird because he's ADAMANT about NO ONE knowing he's    Gay....he doesn't even consider himself that....he says he's NOT gay...He just likes to F white boys.......whatever that means!!!   What does that mean????  Any thoughts????      Anyways...he's the second guy that's been inside me and,...we've been F****ing on and off....but, mostly ON for two weeks now.      But,...he likes roll playing.....I like it too but, its kinda weird!!! So, I wanted to get some outside input!      He likes to pretend that I'm a sissy slave master's son and, he's an escaped slave that....makes me HIS slave      He gets really into it and, at times he's really rough!!! And is really vocal with racial slurs!!! He spanks my bottom open handed really hard....pulls my hair and...All sorts of stuff      I like it but, I feel really weird about it too!!! And, now he's talking about filming it...and, he says he won't but, I think he may put it on the internet!!!!!      He's also trying to talk me into letting some of his friends get involved and I'm really scared of that!!!! He gets mad at me when I tell him that and, tells me "I need to stop being so stingy with my BlG White A$$" That I need to let his friends f it and such!        What does everyone think????  Is this too weird???? Any advise???

Is Satan a myth? Does Satan exist? Where does he exist? How does he show himself to us? How do we protect ourselves from his temptations and his cursed actions?

I have a pharmacology graduate school interview soon.  The dress code is casual nice and the weather will probably be hot.  Is a dress like this ok?  I’m planning on wearing the blue one.       http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...       I figure since it’s from Banana Republic, it’s probably conservative enough.  However I’m worried the dress length might be too short, specifically the slit in the middle (as displayed in the picture).  When I wear the dress and stand, the hem is 1 inch above the knee and the slit is 4 inches above the knee.  The slit is not noticeable standing, except when I walk.  However when I sit, the hem and slit hit my mid-thigh (5 inches above my knee).      Inputs anyone?  (Also, please comment if you’ve been on a graduate school’s interview panel before or if you’re a grad student or whichever walk of life your experience/ input is based on.) Thanks!

Some people say "he's american" or "he's chinese"   to mean His white or he's chinese( and specifically Asian)      But isn't it true that most countries now don't have a single race?? Why would people use American to mean white when american can be of many different races.      Many Asian Americans  tend to do this when describing their race. like "I'm japanese" well....uhhh there's some japanese that are actually white, some that are black( mixed)....some that don't even look Asian, etc.

20090219220929AAamCAp	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is Honesty really the best policy?	A friend once told me that if you think like an honest man,you always get caught by people and then you are regarded as a thief. If you think like a thief, you never get caught.      These are words and bottom line charactor has to do with your nature. Whenever I do something, I always think of others. In business, I always feel that if I can empower others, why not. The sad part is that you land up being used and when they done with you, they go around saying bad things about you. Also this nature of mine has led me to loose most of the times.      I always say that I am going to change and become hard but I cannot. Then I have this belief that all the wrong thats done to me will be rewarded to me in the hereafter, I do not argue or fight with anyone as I feel they all have to answer to God.      Now what I am about to say might sound silly and religious leaders would get upset by such a thought. I sometimes feel that those who do wrong and are ruthless are the ones who get far in life. I believe that as good humble people we get stepped on all the time.      I sometimes feel that maybe by doing the wrong thing would assist me in great rewards for success.After that I would do what others do, become very religious and donate to charities.      I have learnt one important thing in life, if you steal a loaf of bread, you are a thief and yet you stole the bread to fill your stomache. If you steal a million, nobody cares, you get respect. Money earns respect, people do not care about your personality and judge you by that.      So I ask is "honesty really the best policy?"

I was trying to say goodbye to someone today after having a pleasant chat and when it came time for the conversation to be over, I sort of meekly said "bye". But I really meant to say "Goodbye!!

I want to be really nice and say goodbye, but it's sort of painful or anguishing at the same time too, because I don't want them to detect how much I liked talking to them, because then they may be like "whoa, whoa, cool down now" and that will seem like really clingy or...something.       But there's got to be a better way to "bye" and be okay about it without being too cheesetastic, AND without making the other person feel like "well, that was weird, why can't they just say bye the normal way?"

She has to be the sexiest one with the most guys to feel sufficient I guess?      She's always taking jabs out on me and my other friends. She told one friend she got the "lesbo vibe" because my friend hasn't kissed a guy yet. Last weekend we were in Walmart and a lady told me I looked a lot like an actress Amy Adams. A few nights later my friend commented that Amy Adams was really ugly.        It's just getting so old because she pulls non-aggressive stunts like that a lot, and it seems like it would be awkward to comment on it. Plus, she actually can be really funny and fun to hang out with at times. Any tips?

20090219192824AALzMNG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian/Catholic-- verses and prayer related to being proud of your beliefs.?	I need vereses from the bible and or prayers that go along with this :      Today we pray that all people who are scared or embarrassed to show their beliefs. We pray for three kinds of people. Firstly, we pray for the people who are afraid to show their beliefs for they will not be accepted by their community. Some people in the world are abused or killed because of what they believe in and therefore are either harmed, lose their faith, convert to another more accepted religion, or not practice their religion. Secondly, we pray for the people who are embarrassed to show their religion for any personal reasons, even though they will not be in danger. Therefore, these people do not practice their religion, losing faith, or they practice secretly, feeling alone and unaccepted. In conclusion, we pray that all people will feel secure and confident in their religion and therefore are proud of what they believe in.       also if you have any suggestions to furthur analyze or correct my paragraph, thankyou : )
20090219172400AAuWQrK	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	I have decided to change-?	My brothers and sisters.    I have been living in my own prison of my own mind for far too long. I am a good man, but a man who has a few things he would like to change about himself.  Reading the Koran,prayer and meeting a muslim have shown me that this path is the one that I wish to take- and the path I beleive that God wishes to take. At one point I felt uncomfortable using the world 'Allah' but now my heart and mind says it not just with comfort, but with passion. Allah is not longer a forgein, arabic word- it is an idea, a being, a spirit- something I can never describe and something I can never stop describing.    I ask you my good brothers and sisters to help me as hang off the cliff on the edge of paradise and love, I may be comfortable hanging on here, but I want to move up to the level of clarity I beleive that Islam can take me. Please pray for me and all of those who are seekers of God, and remind me to pray for you as well. Please help me and the others who seek God to the right words, the right evidence, the right motivation towards our supreme God, the almighty, most forgiving, all knowing Allah! Thank you for all the support and compassion shown here and elsewhere that i go- all that reminds me of my God's love and the love of his beautiful people.
20090219191719AAAZSvN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Christians, I was inspired to write this a few months ago.  any helpful opinions.?	NO meanies Please!   Critique is fine ( constructive criticism to build and grow on is fine)      A LOVE SONG---      He spoke into nothing and brought forth the Light      He whispered a love song and brought forth Life      And all of creation listened and heard the wonderous sound      of God singing a love song and it echoed all around.      When His children cried out to be rescued from wicked hands,      He sent His servant down to bring them out of Egypt land      and teach them how to listen, so they could hear the sound      of God singing a love song that echos all around      Over the ages, time and time again,      we would forget the words so he’d tell us again      Until there came atime, that though the words were written down      the song had no melody, so He sent His Son down.      The sheperds marveled and wondered when they heard the sound      Of God singing a love song that ecoed all around.      A wonderous child grew into a very Godly man      Who sings The Song for everyone and anyone He can      For Jesus knows the melody of The Song lost in the words      and He sang it for anyone who really listened and heard      They followed Him and they delighted in the sound      Of God singing a love song, that echoed all around.      There were some who would not listen they would rather be heard      They would not hear the melody, and refused to hear His words      They closed up thier hearts and stopped up thier ears      They clung to thier vengance and thier fears      They tried to smother out the sound      of God singing a love song that echoed all around      And on to His shoulders, our sins He did bear.      They lead him to the cross, and He took His last breath there.      "Father forgive them! They know not what they do!"      And the thief cried, " Don’t you hear Him? He is praying for you."      As Jesus spent His life; it was a very loud sound,      Of God singing a love song, that echos all around      But that is not the end. Jesus gave us a chance,      To do more than listen, He taught us how to dance!      Father forgive us, and let us lean on you!      Jesus guide us through the steps, as we will sing back to you!      Oh let the faithful gather and marvel at the sound,      of God singing a love song that echos all around      From the stars in the Heavens, to the waters of the deep      From the angels ’round His throne, and to all winthin His reach      Let all Creation join us and rejoice in the sound      of God singing a love song and it echos all around....

What I am asking you is very dear to my heart~ <3       So. I have this really big crush on my best friend. We're both girls, and we both know we aren't straight. We came out to each other like fourmonths back or so.       I've fallen for her charms just over half a year ago and now I just feel is the right time to express my feelings to her. I know she won't stop being my best friend, I know that for sure.       And there is this tiny glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe she likes me back. In public places along with friends, we pretend to crush on each other and pretend to describe our "experiences" with each other all jokingly (think along the lines of 'that's what she said'). Also, we get pretty 'physical' in the sense of her being physically close to me like snuggling and the such. I'm not going into detail, I just simply want to share this xD       No one knows we're not straight except for me and her basically. But I don't think she has a crush on me but still, I would like to express my feelings for her.       Could you please write me a letter that I could give to her? Like something simple and not beyond nine-eleven sentances? Somethign along the lines of, "We've been friends for a really long time and I feel the need to confess somthing to you.. it's not something bad..."

My husband and I have been having some marital problems. Nothing big, but we are still seeing a counselor and one of the problems I have with him is that he watches porn. He says the ONLY reason he looks at it is because I won't let him look at my vagina up close. I've gained some weight recently so I've been feeling more self conscious about my body and I've tried to avoid letting him see my body so closely. Because of this, he says, is the reason why he looks at porn. So that he can see what I won't let him. He swears there is no other reason and that he never jerks off to it. I believe him because he really has no reason to lie. But I'm really curious as to why other men look at it? What about it is so worthy of your attention?

There is light because there is something spending energy (in this case the Sun). The natural state is darkness. To avoid evil (ie. gambling, drinking, etc.) people need an effort (energy) to keep clear of it. The natural state is just to do whatever ou want.   Well, my point is, why would you spend so much energy to change things? would that not be an indication that darkness and evil is the natural way to go?

20090219194447AAMVzSu	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Americans, do you agree with Obama on the subject of bilingualism?	I was researching bilingualism on the internet recently and I found some of Obama's quotes on the subject that seemed somewhat offensive and disrespectful to Americans in my opinion.      Let me say that I am bilingual (eng/spanish) and I do agree that bilingualism can benefit everyone intellectually and healthwise as well.But the way that he approaches the subject is what puts me off. He said it was an embarrassment that Europeans know French, German, English etc... and Americans only know the basics of different languages. Well, wouldn't being multilingual benefit Europeans more since the geography is much more compacted over there? I fail to see how it is necessary for a normal, everday American to have to learn a different language unless they are going into business or health or some other occupation where bilingualism(particularly spanish) could come in handy.I mean many other big nations that don't come into contact with people of other nationalities are almost always monolingual with the exception of tourist attractions.As an American I have never felt like I lacked in education when compared with some of my foreign friends and I can't help but be insulted by some of the stuff he says.But according to Obama, we all lack in education when compared with Europeans.      I believe he has good intentions but I also get the feeling from some of the things he says that he doesn't believe in the American people nor the nation and I feel that is something that is necessary if he wants change.      Okay that was long!To sum up, I believe in learning different languages and its benefits but I don't like the way Obama comes across the subject.      How do you feel about this?

20090219200258AAjvc6X	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	It has been said that homosexuality isn't a choice but people are born with the sexual desire & attraction.?	With that note, and adding in the theory of evolution, when did an ape/human species evolve into a gay ape/human species?      It's a fact that animals aren't gay. They have no sexual desires or urges. They mate only to reproduce. It instinct that makes them mate when they are in heat. They didn't learn it from their parents or friends or school or TV. Some, like dogs, have been seen humping another male dog. It's not a gay desire but a mating instinct.  My thought is, since animals can't be gay (having sexual urge and attraction for the same sex) and evolution states human evolved from apes, and gays are born gay, when did the homosexual gene evolve?            I'm in the middle of 2 online conversations with people that are arguing the Bible with me and homosexuality being a sin. This just came to me. What are your thoughts?

Attributing devine characteristics to the 12 imams and worshipping them from shias own books:      All the Imams are infallible just like the prophets. The Shi'ites derive their religion from their immaculate Imams" (Ibid, p. 22) Well this is a clear statement of kufr from the Shi'ites, as you can see they admit that they derive their religion from their Imams, well this means that if a Shi'ite Imam made something that in the Qur'an was lawful, forbidden, the Shi'ites would follow their Imams... by this statement the Shi'ites have taken themselves outside Islam.      "By listening to the voice of a person, the Imams can tell if the person was destined to go to hell or to heaven; they would thus answer his questions accordingly" (Usool al Kafi, p. 185) Dear Brothers and Sisters, as you can see the Shi'ites make their Imams out to be some God-like being, can't they see that this is Shirk (worshipping other than Allah, or associating partners with him).      "The Imams possess all the knowledge granted to angels, prophets and messengers" (Al-Kulaini, Al-kaafi, p.255.) Well here is more shirk from the Shi'ites... How can an Imam, who is just a human, know the Unseen??? Only Allah knows the Unseen, and think about this... The Imams were not even Alive at the time of all of the prophets so here is a major contradiction in the Shi'ite faith!      "The Imams know when they will die, and they do not die except by their own choice" (Ibid, p: 258.) Now, this is a clear statement of kufr. Only Allah knows when a man will die! And these Shi'ites say that their Imams can control when they die?? This is major kufr and shirk for any one to believe in all the things that the Shi'ites say about their Imams!      "The Imams have knowledge of whatever occurred in the past and whatever will happen in the future, and nothing is concealed from them" (Ibid, p. 260.) Subhanallah!! Only Allah knows the future for any person to say that these Imams know the Unseen is committing Shirk and takes himself outside Islam.      "The Imams have knowledge of all the revealed books, regardless of the languages in which they were revealed" (Ibid, p. 227.) As you can see these Shi'ites have elevated their Imams to a God-like level, and the Shi'ites say that there is nothing wrong with this!!! Now can we see why the Shi'ites are different to us muslims!      "No one compiled the Qur'an completely except the Imams, and they encompass all of its knowledge' (Ibid, p. 228) So since the Qur'an was not compiled by the Imams then does that mean that the Quran is fabricated????? These Shi'ites want to even destroy Islam... look at what they say, they even insult the Qur'an!! And it is a well known fact that the Shi'ites have their own Qur'an (On this web site we have an article all about the false lies that the Shi'ites put in their own so called Qur'an).      "Signs of the prophets are possessed by the Imams" (Ibid, p. 231.) The Shi'ites have once again elevated their Imams to a very high level. The Imams they refer too are only human! So why do the Shi'ites worship them.      "When the Imams' time comes, they will rule in accordance with the ruling of the prophet David and his dynasty. These Imams will not need to ask for presentation of evidence before passing their judgments" (Ibid,p. 397.) The Shi'ites even think that their Imams can do what ever they want!! Here they say that their Imams can just pass judgment on anybody! And they say that their Imams will not rule by the Qur'an but will rule by the laws of David!! (All Muslims must rule by the Qur'an and Sunnah). This is a proof that the awaited Imam of the Shi'ites is not the one that Muslims believe in but he is indeed the Anti-Christ (A'war al-Dajjal). The one that all Jews are waiting for him.      "There is not a single truth possessed by a people save that which originated with the Imams, and everything which did not proceed from them is false" (Ibid, p.277.)

20090219202835AA99awd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	By what standards are things "not real"?	Something I've noticed about Christian attitudes towards the existence of God is that they allow all these virtues to be placed upon God, including existence, that seem to be a double standard.      Christians assert that Zeus is not real. By what, non self-authenticating criteria is this done?      Christians assert that pixies are not real. By what, non self-authenticating criteria is this done?      I've noticed, that unless one has a personal investment in the Christian faith, the arguments that discredit the existence or the necessity of existence for things like Zeus and pixies also discredit the necessity for the existence of God.      Why does the Judeo-Christian God get the benfit of the doubt when it comes to the justification of truth?

My idea is to make sort of a collage say "I love you." I'm thinking about making one of those collages where you use really small pictures to make a letter or bigger image. Like the "I" would be made up of tiny pictures of me, the "Love" would be made up if tiny pictures of the two of us, and the "You" would be made up of tiny pictures of him. I was hoping to use a few different pictures of each... like making copies of 3 pictures of me, 3 pictures of us, and 3 pictures of him and repeating them in the words. To do this should I just get 9 8X12s with as many images of the same picture as I can fit? Can you even do this? How much would it cost? How else could I do this? Also... any tips are welcome. Thanks guys!

Jonas Brothers? Fred? Miley Cyrus? Twilight? What is so interesting about talentless pop bands, a teen who likes to set his voice to a really annoying pitch that couldn't possibly entertain anyone except an idiot. Miley Cyrus? Ok, she isn't THAT horrible, and I don't have anything against her, but why is she up with all the Top News? Why do people want to know about her instead of news about the stimulus bill or something that actually matters. and Twiight? How did this ' romance ' suddenly become a fad? The movie was commercial garbage, the books were. . . Mediocre. I ALWAYS read/watch something before actually making a judgement ( except the Twilight movie, ANYTHING but that, trailer and reviews were pretty clear though ) Twilight: Okay, nothing too special, not much of a job to draw reader in, unrealistic start to a relationship. New Moon: It was slightly interesting to read about what happens without Edward around, introduces a pretty good plot twist. Eclipse: Completely crappy, the climax was pretty damn obvious, and made no attempt to garner anything interesting in terms of romance or adventure. Breaking Dawn: Piece of Shiet. The ending was so boring and still it was almost LAUGHABLE. the get ready part? wow. . . that was beyond dissapointing, i wanted some vampire to get torn apart by other vampires. Didn't anyone else? Stephenie Meyer is a pretty horrible author, and Twilight series is some pretty nice 'epic fail'. There is instead something much more real and beautiful, Let the Right one In. This Swedish book and film is just so deep and beautiful. Although the movie didn't have any big explosions or cars flipping, or incredible graphics, it had a very interesting plot. An adolescent boy pretending to stab people falls in love with a teenage vampire. Although it is a bit 'boring' it is a very true to the heart romance, and no major advertising, if not, any.These two films/books are so similar in genre yet vastly different in meaning. Instead of a true piece of art, modern day society leans toward commercial filled crap literature. Why do we do this? What has happened to make us so. . . stupid? ( try guessing my age-- less than 15 years old, and give feedback and comments on this )

20090219202409AAZlxsr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you realize your personal emotional experience can't convince anyone else that your god is real?	Theists love to cite their faith, feelings in their heart, or their personal comfort as evidence for the existence of their respective gods. Well, maybe that's good enough for you, but that doesn't convince anyone else. Whatever you feel in your heart, I don't feel in mine, and nobody else feels in theirs, and you can't actually convey that feeling to anyone else. So that can't convince anyone who doesn't believe in your god(s) to begin believing in him/her/them/it.

20090219202149AAHTONo	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	A question for African Americans about exposure to their culture, which is more important quality or quantity?	I ask this question because I have heard African Americans claim that non-African Americans have a limited exposure to African American culture. So I ask which is more important to African Americans, that non-African American people get a larger quantity or quality of exposure to African American culture? What I mean by quantity is is it more important for a non-African American to spend more time around African Americans in some way. What I mean by quality is it more important where the time spent is spent. For example do you prefer a non-African American who is always around African Americans (quantity) or do you prefer a non-African American whose spends less time around African Americans but understands more aspects of their culture (quality). In both cases exposure to African American culture is there, but I wonder what type of exposure is more important to African Americans?

20090203102135AAyAI3h	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	.........."Illogical Party"?	Hm, it would be nice if people posted “jokes” that were actually funny.      A few weeks ago I went to a gay bar with an old friend just to chat and hang out for a little while. I’m straight, but I’m not a “gay hater” either. What I want point out is I understand both sides of this sliding scale. So at this gay bar, they had men in skin tight nut hugging Speedo underwear twiddling around on the surrounding screens and women practically stripping on tables. It was sort of entertaining and sickening at the same time. The representation that many gays present make it hard for the gays who have actually a good set of morals… Watching everyone on the dance floor rub and hump on one another was like watching horny drunk sex slaves who know no other way then to present themselves thru sex. Maybe this was wrong of me but I couldn’t help but wonder how many of them were molested as children compared to straight people. I mean, hm, the odds, what are they? And maybe “I AM A CARE BEAR”, because I couldn’t help but feel sad for them since they looked so messy. If I weren’t me and I came to a gay bar as so, maybe this would frighten me and lead me to characterize every gay person as the mess I just witnessed. This also happens in straight clubs but it’s easier to point it out in you’re opposite. AIDS is what came to mind. Why?

Just because a person cuts or thinks about suicide that does not make them emo.       But I am obsessed with death. Literally. Especially suicide. I have been depressed, I have cut, and I have attempted suicide. It even comes up in my DREAMS (see next post). I'm still here, though, obviously I'm so chickenshit I can't kill myself. I'm not like one of those psychotic insane people who go and shoot up their schools, but I just can't stop thinking about death. Death does make me sad, though, even if I do think about it alot. But my life is so not worth living, that maybe I should just do it. I mean my life isn't hard, I have it good. It's ME. I'm not good enough for anything. I'm not special. I'm not cool. I haven't had anyone of the opposite sex look at me since I was ten, and my life is going nowhere. It just seems like 13 years of life is too short. I'm not sick of life, I'm sick of me. The cutting doesn't help, nothing does. What can I do?

As a new-White, one who is not a sell-out to the new White ideology, can you not be opinionated about the hardships of minorities? Can you not possess a music collection with less than 60% non-White artists, Can you not feel in some way ashamed and quieted by a sense of guilt or shame about actions you read about or racist ideas you are helpless to have simply because they are unconscious? It seems that you are sell-out among whites if you act in anyway which was once considered to be stereotypically white. Any comments?

There are a lot of old men behind bars today that have had sex with 9 year old little girls and said their god told them to do it, the same as Muhammed did.         Could it be that the Muslim allah back in Muhammed's time didn't realize that people would be more civilized and less barbaric in the future and that is why the Muslim allah told Muhammed it was O.K.?

It really was not a bad day of work though--I got in at 10:00 AM and was gone by 3:00 PM so it was a perfectly lovely schedule, and my few bad apples weren't there, so I actually had a lot of fun.    I kicked off my day by trying out Mexican restaurant, Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food  I already have a favorite tiny little Mexican restaurant Pueblo Solis, but I'm thrilled to have another tasty option closer to home.  The prices were a drop higher than my favorite hole in the wall, but I think I will definitely be making a return visit.  After an amazingly food, I had my turn to work on homework.  I did my business law and accounting home work which was easy.  Later, I had my dinner which was fish sandwich and then I brush my teeth and pray to God that I will have a good day tomorrow.  Overall, after I am done with everything I went to bed at 10:00 Pm and it was a great day for  me since I got everything done.

To this day the Palestinians claim that the Jews committed Genocide and ethnic cleansing from 1917 till 1967 against Palestinians in order to steal the land.      Well my question is this......Before 1917 there is no historical record labeling anyone as a Palestinian so how did the Jews commit genocide before this time?      From 1917 till 1967 it was the Jews that was labled as palestinians so does this mean they commited self imposed genocide on themselves?

George got offended because a guy had a statue of a sleeping gnome lookin thing that was Mexican only because it had on a sombrero (couldn't see the face) Me as a Mexican thought that was so dumb. They could have came up with something better. George thought the "racist guy" was implying Mexicans are "lazy" Who cares if it was sleeping it could have been a white sleeping statue too.         I know for a fact Mexicans are not stereotyped as lazy, were the ones who are GENERALIZED as the field/factory workers who do all the bad jobs in America that other races won't do. We may be stereotyped as illegal, but not lazy.

20090203105557AAkiNnU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Jesus Christ God, or part of God?	I have always had a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of a triune God. I was taught that God is the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,  but it never made that much sense to me, especially since I can't ever recall reading anything in the Old Testament about a biune God consisting of the Father and the Holy Spirit. I also can't understand if Jesus is God why would he have prayed to himself in the Garden of Gethsemane?       I'm not saying that God is not Triune, I just don't understand how He can be, so if you have any insight, please explain. If you have links please post those as well. Thank you.

I am not sure if it is my buisness, maybe it is, maybe it is not, but I am asking for advice. I live in a apartment with my friend in the downtown Toronto area. The people who live directly across the hall constantly fight, so loud I can hear it and others can that live on our floor. The police have came before because I just recently heard them knowing on their door. I am 100% positive he hits his wife, girlfriend, whatever they are. I've heard it on several occasions, and things like her screaming and ''not to touch me.'' But because others call the cops on them, when they do come, they deny everything and say it was all worked out. They also have a baby. And I hear the baby cry often. I also often see the man many times walk out and slam the door, and off he goes. I am not sure how to handle it though. I do not want to get involved, but anytime I see the lady in the elevator in such, I sometimes see such a cry for help. I was just wondering what others would do in this situation? I am 19, my roomate is 21. We are two young college girls, but we do care.
