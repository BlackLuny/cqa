20090222150154AAUO96k	Sports;Baseball	I need help making a decision:  Should I or should I not try out for my highschool's softball team?	I'm a freshman who just finished a long basketball season.  I love playing softball and I've played it for a couple years... I'm decent and making the team isn't going to be something I'm going to worry about but anyways I'll lay out my pro's and con's...      Pros:   I love playing softball as a sport and I know I'll miss it if I don't try out   It'll help me stay active and in shape    I'll get a in school study hall instead of P.E. which is so nice because P.E. is torture and I like getting my homework done   If I do it and don't like it at least next year I'll regret not trying out or wonder if I would've liked doing it      Cons:   Basketball made my so busy and my life hectic... Do I really want to jump into another sport season?   I can get along with anyone really but a couple really trashy or annoying girls on the team will make the season less enjoyable for me   I have a feeling our softball team isn't going to be that good... I didn't see a lot of talent and after a horrible coached and horrible team as a whole with basketball my confidence and dignity will not appreiciate me launching myself onto another losing team   I heard that people think everyone on the softball team is a bunch of big lesbians.  I'm not the one too label, judge, or think things of something I'm do not know or familiar with but having people think fondly of the team I'm on well... Is something I would like you know?         Well what do you think?  I'm having a tough time.  I'm not leaning towards not doing it or doing it so I really need to know which option you think I should go with and why.

20090222151553AAsmFzb	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Should i add Aaron Brooks,  Ryan Gomes, Tyrus Thomas,  or Kendrick Perkins in ESPN  Fantasy Basketball?	Should i add Aaron Brooks,  Ryan Gomes, Tyrus Thomas,  or Kendrick Perkins in ESPN  Fantasy Basketball?  It is a non-keeper league and i just really need a push for the rest of the season and these are the best players available.  Brooks is playing more because mcgrady is out for the season and alston was traded.  Gomes is playing more because Al Jefferson is out for the season.  Tyrus Thomas has been playing very well lately, but the Bulls did just acquire brad miller and john salmons, while also getting rid of drew gooden and andres nocioni.  Kendrick Perkins will play more because  Kevin Garnet will be out 2-3 weeks with an injury.   This is a league where rebounds, assists, fg made, ft made, blocks, and steals all get one point and fg missed, ft missed, and turnover all get -1 point.  This makes it so one stat is not more relative to my team than another.  My team does not need one certain position either, making position also irrelevant.  I just wanted a few other people's opinions on what i should do to make it a successful run.

Pace speed-young definitely as young and agbonlahor are the fastest players in english football.   Delivery of the ball/killer pass-Young again cause he serves much more assists and can bend it like beckham.   Work rate-Young he works much harder for the team and has more stamina never gives up like ronaldo.   Skill-This one maybe ronaldo   Overall-Young is much better allrounf player than ronaldo is    Underated=Ashely Young   Overater=Christiana Ronaldo   Ronaldo is only know for his tricks.   What do you think ?

20090222122653AAYTQ6M	Sports;Baseball	Who is Happy for Ken Griffey Jr.?	I hope he can play until he is 43 to end his career the same age as Willie Mays. Also, I hope after his 1 year contract w/ the Mariners is through they sign him on for the last winding years of his career to retire where he began, in Seattle.      I am a Mets fan, but I am pulling for Seattle to have a winner this year in the Mariners. Sports - in that city this year was not kinds. They, lost the Sonics. Only team to win a sports championship in the city and the Seahawks sucked. Hopefully, Mariners can turn it around for them w/ the return of the Kid.      Who I think is the greatest hitter of this generation being that I think he has far too much respect for the game to take steroids. He has made a name for himself not only as a great outfielder. But, one of the best hitters this game has ever seen. All his HR's I think are earned for amidst playing in the same era of cheaters, like McGwire, Sosa, Palmeiro, Bonds, and A-Rod. Also, do you think he can have 1 more 30 HR season to surpass Willie Mays on the HR list doing it on the Mariners, which is sweeter. The team he was on where he broke many records?

20090222120954AAN2nSs	Sports;Basketball	Why does Paul Pierce like wheelchairs so much?	Boston Celtics forward Paul Pierce is downplaying the way his teammates carried him off the court, and his use of a wheelchair to get to the locker room after he allegedly suffered a knee sprain in Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.      According to Pierce, he always uses a wheelchair to get around, and this was no different. “You see guys all the time riding Segways around their houses, and on the streets and stuff. Well, I have my own version of a Segway – a wheelchair.”      During the third quarter of Game 1, Pierce went down in a heap, holding his knee in what appeared to be agonizing pain. He had to be lifted off the floor by teammates and trainers, who carried him over to the bench.      Eventually, Pierce was put into a wheelchair and rolled back to the training room. Just minutes later, he returned, with seemingly no ill effects. Skeptics came out of the woodwork almost immediately, and Pierce has had to defend himself against allegations of exaggerating the seriousness of the injury for dramatic effect.      Pierce continued that campaign by insisting that he regularly uses a wheelchair, and that teammates often carry him around.      “It reduces the chances of some silly injury. And besides, I really don’t like to walk too much,” said the former Kansas Jayhawk. “Before practice, after practice – my teammates are usually nice enough to carry me on and off the court. I take my wheelchair with me from home, and when I drive to practice and games, I just wheel myself into the locker room. From there, four or five guys carry me out to the floor.”      Pierce went so far as to claim that he has been using the wheelchair for about two years as an extra measure to keep him healthy and ready to play. Teammate Kevin Garnett says Pierce is a pro with the wheelchair.      “Oh yeah, he’s got some moves on that thing,” the Big Ticket said. “He can do jumps, wheelies and some other cool tricks. Paul has really mastered that thing.”

According to the ad, the show will debut on Thursday, April 16, 2009 at 8:00 p.m. The ad says Superstars from RAW, SmackDown and ECW will be on the program.      The new "WWE Superstars" show is expected to be a "C-Show," so it will likely feature Superstars having trouble getting ring time on the televised Raw, SmackDown and ECW programs:      Charlie Haas, Curt Hawkins, DJ Gabriel, Dolph Ziggler, Festus, Goldust, "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan, Hurricane Helms, Jamie Noble, Jesse, Jimmy Wang Yang, Kizarny, Kung Fu Naki, Manu, Ricky Ortiz, Sim Snuka, and Zack Ryder.      Divas: Alicia Fox, Brie Bella, Candice Michelle, Katie Lea Burchill, Maria, Mickie James, Natalya, and Nikki Bella.      I think it is a great idea, now the low-mid-card superstars will have their moment on t.v. as well. What are your thoughts about the show?

20090222120744AA84RQ6	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	What is a good starter plinking rifle?	I'm looking for a good starter rifle. I've seen recommendations for the ruger 10/22 and other .22 caliber. But I'm also very interested in guns with history and honestly, higher caliber (i.e. the Moison Nagant or Lee Enfield).      I have an extremely limited budget. Ideally, I would like to spend less than $200 on the rifle itself. Ammuntion cost is also a factor. I've seen it may be hard to find the Moison Nagant ammunition.      Also, if ammunition is the same caliber, is it completely interchangeable with other rifles?      Answers are appreciated. Thanks!

Former Maryland WR Darrius Heyward-Bey ran a 4.30, second fastest for a WR since 2000.  Michael Crabtree is gonna have surgery on his stress facture in his left foot after he performs his workout for scouts.  Other WR's have been putting up some pretty impressive numbers in their 40's.  Looks like Michael Crabtree isn't the only bluechip receiver in the upcoming draft.  Crabtree's stock might drop because of it, because speed kills!  That's what teams need.  On another note, they had a KICKER, from some college, who was going off in the bench press drills, doing multiple reps of 225 lbs.  He was making it look pretty easy, too!  Now THAT'S impressive!!

I haven't been playing long but i have a lot of natural ability, heart, and overall athleticism. I do feel as if i have a dis-advantage compared to my other teammates considering they all played since they were three, there parents are very involved with softball, and they have all the expensive equipment. But i managed to learn everything by myself like i do with everything else and im pretty good and better then a lot of players but i wish i could be the best. Also i pitch and i just started at the end of last season but when should i try fast pitch? I feel left in the dust because all my team mates are on traveling teams and tournament teams but im confused on even how to get on one. I've struggling to play softball, I use to beg my mom when i was little to start softball young but she didnt let me, she never went to my games, ever practiced with me, i was alone when i hit my first home run, and the only thing i would ask for on my birthday was softball gear and i even went to my game on my birthday. Also, the couch whos team always wins couches the all star team ( which i was on last year) and he hates me! he even makes fun of me and i cried  on the field. He never played me and he never even knew how good i could play! One last thing when i played on the all star team it was all the couches kids and the popular people and i didnt feel happy because i play softball to laugh and be with friends but those people arent my friends. I have fun playing on a regular team and we all take pictures and what not but i wanna go far in this. WHAT SHOULD I DO!!

I have tryouts in less than a week and I would be middie because I'm a great runner, but I really HATE defense. And attack is just something I've been pretty good at since last year when I started. Well, I was defense until the end of the season. HELP!

20090222132335AA1BsmS	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	What Handgun Should I Get?	I am getting a handgun or 2 for my dad. He lives a little bit out side the city and has a small farm. There has been a rash of break-ins and a few other factors that have lead me to my current decision to get him one.      What are a list of 5 guns that pack a punch, but are relatively easy to use? id like it to be of above average quality and common enough to get a holster for. (money is not exactly an issue, but under $1000 would be nice). I have looked at a small s/w 38 special revolver that was recommended to me by a police officer buddy. He carries it as his ankle gun. It seems to be a pretty well built small gun for in a truck glove box or a dresser drawer. But id like to get him another one that is a little bigger. That is my 10 cents. lol.       Thanks for all your help.

20090222135630AA0P6og	Sports;Football (American)	Should the Eagles keep Donovan McNabb?	I am a huge eagles fan, been one all my life, and i personally do not think we should keep him. I think it would be better for the team if we gave him his walking papers, but thats me. he is inconsistent, and he always winds up blowing it in the big games. lets take a look: 5 NFC championships, 4 were lost, and the one that we won, was lost to the patriots in the super bowl. and mcnabb has great recievers to throw to! i dont know where everybody's saying we have no recievers! we have Desean jackson, the fastest wide reciever in the league probably.kevin curtis, a great wide reciever when you bomb it down the field. jason avant, who  is emerging into a consistent target. and our backup tight end brent celek is pretty good to, for filling in for L.J. smith. and another thing,  i dont know where everybody's saying kevin kolb is that bad. he played one game, when mcnab was benched, and he threw two interceptions, but what can you expect when your playing the ravens in your first nfl start! thats a quarterback nightmare!! well anyway, i wanna know what u guys think.

To another high octane offensive team in Indiana that have a lot of double digit scorers and turn into a 20+ PPG scorer. I mean last year he scored 19+ a game and this year off an injury missing almost the entire first half of the season he has bounced back and is a 15+ PPG scorer. How has he done this on a high octane offense, like Indy and could not do it in a high octane offense in GS?
