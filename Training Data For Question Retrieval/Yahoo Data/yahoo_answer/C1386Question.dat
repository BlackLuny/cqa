When pressed, all the anti-feminists claim to be "equalists" and in favor of civil rights.  Then a few questions later it's these same anti-fems that are insinuating that all feminists are dykes and lesbos, throwing those words around like being gay is something derogatory.  Now I know, not all of you have actually said "all feminists are lesbians", but I've never seen any of the anti-fems that frequent this site speak out against that kind of behavior either.  So tell me guys (and girls), how does homophobia fit into your definition of an equalist?

Sometimes it seems there are negative responses to a woman who wants a career as well as a family.  The idea of "wanting it all" is sometimes seen as selfish and impossible.  While "all" does seem a bit implausible, what is wrong with wanting a career and a family as well (and does wanting both really equate to "all")?        It seem men have been having it "all" (career and family) for some time now but suddenly if a woman wants the same thing, its selfish, impossible, and a danger to her family?

20090304115404AAKlgR6	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why do I have these dreams?	Some times I have weird dreams that always have to do with something about me. Like, I've dreamed that I look in the mirror and I find a bald spot on my head.. I am losing my hair..      I've also dreamed that I have a wrinkle on my forehead. Very noticeable.. (I am 21 yrs old).      Last night I dreamed that all 4 wisdom teeth came out at once and they were very uncomfortable when I closed my mouth and i could feel them through the outside of my cheek.      I had a very disturbing dream one time where i broke my jaw. In my dream i panicked and was very worried.      These are just a few dreams but I've had them for quite a while now, not every night just some times. And they are very weird.. I am so glad when I wake up and realize its not true. But they usually tend to involve something from my body.. either missing something, or growing something or just things like that.. Any opinions on why I have them? Does it mean something?

I couldn't breathe and almost passed out. I cannot stand to drive by a bridge. All the steep roads make my heart jump and beat crazy. I cannot stand being in an elevator at all i get like panic attacks. I cry when im on roller coaster. Even if i see them my heart pounds, my eyes water and my legs shake.

20090227064414AACQkIR	Social Science;Psychology	Can this be affecting my hostility towards my boyfriend?	About two weeks ago, I found out that my first love still has feelings for me and would have asked me back out in November (we broke up a year ago) but got upset and held it in because I was with a new guy.   We broke up for a very complicated reason, distance actually, so it's not like we got into a fight and broke up. For that reason, I still care about him.   When my boyfriend and I found that out, we both got a little upset, and I felt caught between them. I love my current boyfriend, Scott, with all my heart, but I also wanted to make Patrick, my first love, happy. But I wasn't willing to break Scott's heart to make that happen.   Since then, I've been acting a little hostile towards Scott. I'm also on my period, if that means anything.   I haven't been aggressive; it's more like passive aggression like picking fights and trying to make him feel like the one at fault in situations.   I don't mean to do this. I love him with my whole heart, for God sakes! But why am I doing it?   He's so good to me, and I feel like a terrible person.
20090227071402AAH0hCm	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should allegations be taken seriously?	Here's a story about a dad accused of sexually abusing 2 daughters and then killing the daughters and the mother.      The girls alerted their friends of the molestation. These friends told their parents. Nothing was done about the accusations.      Accusations are not often taken seriously. "They're lying" "They're being coached." "The man is a pillar of society".....      When will society learn to take allegations of abuse seriously?    What will it take?       http://www.miamiherald.com/news/southflo...       excerpt:   A few weeks before Pablo Josue Amador shot and killed his wife and two daughters before taking his own life, 14-year-old Priscila Amador told two classmates her father had molested her since she was in elementary school.      One student advised her mother of the allegation and then told reporters about it outside the Amador home in Perrine on Wednesday, hours after the killings. The other classmate alerted her father,      ''She was telling me . . . throughout her life her dad would sexually abuse her. She was done with it and she didn't want to live,'' Marcela said.      Marcela said she told her mother what Priscila had said about the molestation. Marcela's mother, Gloria Cano, told reporters Marcela advised her of the allegations about a month ago and that she wishes now she had acted.      ''I really regret it,'' Cano said.      ``I don't know if I was the only adult. I don't know if this would have stopped. I don't have words.''      It's unclear if Priscila had told anyone else about the allegations, Marcela said."
20090227071048AABNIDt	Social Science;Psychology	What does this dream mean?	I had a dream --actually, a bit of a nightmare-- that I was in a man's room with red walls. Then the man embraced me but soon after stuck needles into my body. Then we were in his car and I was looking out the window while he was driving and I think he told me not to speak to anyone in a threatening way. Then we were back in his house again in a bath tub which was inside a bathroom with gray tiles and I wanted to escape but I was scared.       Then while he wasn't looking, I ran through a maze like hallway with weird angles but I felt him chasing after me behind. I then reached what seemed to be the exit that had a blinding white light when I opened the door. But then I was running through the same hallway over and over again with him still chasing me. After a few times, he finally caught up to me and jumped infront of me but I pushed him away with a magical power (a light purple force field?) and escaped.         Then I was on the deck of a boat with one of my friends and I told her about the man. She said not to worry and that the man did the same thing to her as well. Then he came up from inside the boat and chased after us and tried to grab us. We screamed but no one could hear. Somehow after pushing him for a while, we got him arrested XD      But then later on in the dream, he found another girl and I tried to warn her but we both didn't like each other. For some reason, little pink flowers trailed him. Then they got in a room that I couldn't see through and more pink flowers bloomed outside the door and I had a feeling that they did "it".       Later on in the dream, the girl cried as I told her what kind of person he was and said, "Why didn't you tell me?"      What does this dream mean?      Sorry its really long XD

20090304110940AAhcqJe	Social Science;Psychology	Has white female beauty become a religion for me?	I am so in love with white female beauty, it is almost all I think about. In all of the beauty in nature, the tree, the sky, the sea, I find the elegance of her white female beauty to be the most beautiful. See  http://www.wallpaperbase.com/wallpapers/...  . Indeed, her golden blond hair, shining as bright as the sun; her cherry red or elegant brown hair, is as likeable. Her many different eye colors like the rainbows in the sky and her white female beauty being the pot of gold at the end of it. Her beautiful white face & skin so more pure looking than snow. Her soft white barefeet like vanilla ice cream. She is exceedingly beautiful in appearance. See  http://cm.iparenting.com/fc/editor_files...  .      However, I don't believe that all other types of women are unattractive because I could say nice things about their features, as well. I'm just in awe of white female beauty and she is most beautiful to me.       So I ask, has white female beauty become a religion to me?      Thanks for answering.

I've suffered from confused thoughts and depression for around 15 years now since 18 (and have tried everything to help me get better, from seroxat, to cognitive behavioural therapy,  counselling and self help books (including following a healthy diet, vitamins, and exercise) and nothing has really helped in the long term. I always end up feeling lost, disconnected and don't know what i really want, or have a purpose      The more depressed i feel the worse it makes my situations, from losing jobs, to not being able to engage properly in the relationships i do have because i am withdrawn and living in another world. Also the depression has made me not care about anything including relationships with family and friends,       Basically i have given up hope that i can ever get on an even keel and live a happier life that doesn't involve thinking about everything and one where i can feel i have a purpose with close people around me..      Does anyone have any advice or have been in a similar position and suggest with what helped them, whether it be ssri, st john wort of other suggestions... i am desparate, i don't want to leave, but i am feeling like i have tried so hard and nothing has worked to help me feel better, and led a less despairing life... i feel as though the depression is punishing me       though i respect all forms of religion i would appreciate not receiving any advice / suggestion related to religion thank you

Example (1.) a home that was bought in was valued in the $30,000 - $40,000 in the 70's is now valued at $200,000 - $400,000 in 2009 with little change to the home.   Example (2.) a car that sold for $18,000 in 2007 is now valued at $8,000 in 2009 with 40,000 km. The point is what is the difference, both wear out with age an one cost you more too repair than the other (the home). Why should I pay so much for over valued old homes?

20090304113839AAqTTrN	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone interpret this dream?	This morning I dreamed I saw a young man standing in a home library. His parents were telling him he couldn't be with the girl he loved, who was standing on the other side of a row of books. Then the parents took the two, in separate cars, with a group to see a bunch of lights. I think the lights made a formation, but I can't remember what - I just remember it was night and the lights lit the night sky up. The two decided to defy their parents wishes and the young woman ended up pregnant. Then she started having flashbacks to when she was pregnant before. She'd had a home birth inside a crib, but instead of having a baby she laid an egg. The young man was watching through a Mardi Gras mask. The egg hatched and a tiny, fragile girl came out. She either died or was taken away by the parents, I'm not sure which. The flashback ended and the young woman could hear the static of a baby monitor, but there was no monitor. Then there was a thud outside the bedroom door and the young woman opened it to see a boy crumpled against the doorway, claiming he could hear the static, too. Then the dream ended.       I dreamt from both the perspective of the young man and the young woman.

20090304114323AAGywI3	Social Science;Psychology	How to deal with jealous work colleagues?	In my workplace, one of the women I work very closely with (on the same level as me) has been causing me a lot of serious problems.  She has been putting me down a lot, constantly looking for faults in my work and pointing them out to other people to try to get me in trouble for it etc.  What I think caused it was way back at the beginning, she tried to boss me about a lot but I tried to deal with it the right way and told our boss about it, who pulled her up for it.  Ever since then she has held a grudge against me.  A few months ago she backed me into a corner (verbally) and I lashed out and said something unacceptable to her, which I immediately apologised for several times.  She reported it to the boss and made as big a deal out of it as possible, tried to turn everyone against me because of it.  It nearly wrecked my career.  I am now moving to a new job, on my last few days she made a point of grassing me up to the boss as often as possible (she made things up by twisting words I said to other people about totally random things), probably so she could get me in as bad a light as possible in my bosses eyes before I left.  My question is - in my new job, I want to avoid this from ever happening again.  How do you spot these people, and what would have been the best way to deal with this? Thanks so much for any help, really appreciated!
20090304125415AASsJlh	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How is the supposed "equality of opportunity" possible given that we are all unique?	We are each born with advantages and disadvantages. For example, my IQ is about 60 points higher than that of the average feminist, so if we had a system in which all had an equal opportunity, I would have to be penalized because of my birthright so that I could under-perform at the same level as feminists. Suppose that I was penalized for my advantages and one day I decided to stop eating my vegetables and became intellectually slovenly as a result. Then I would under-perform relative to feminists because of my broccoli deficit.      And if my IQ, being naturally inborn, is accepted as one of the advantages deemed worthy by the matriarchy, what's to stop them from using it as evidence that I have some other advantage? Perhaps my success is the result of being a white male? Or heterosexual? Or a Republican? Won't "equality" come at the expense of "justice"?

You often see women grab the sides of their top and pull them in as if huddling against the wind with a cardigan or something except when its not cold. Why? Habbit? insecure? it seems rather odd especially when its not that cold and they have a layer or two on.

20090304120424AABYmdf	Social Science;Psychology	I have dreamt this dream three times and so I would like to know what does it mean.Thanks?	Please,to anyone who has the intention of answering my question,please answer it seriously since I'm taking it very seriously.         I had dreamt of being in a castle..,a very old castle hidden abandoned and I had a key...there were few (like 2 probably) people (who I don't remember who they are) by my side and then there were other people that were trying to get inside this castle.For a certain reason I didn't want them to get it.So,I was pratically fighting with these people.Even,if I had the key they still managed to get in.Once I remember one got in by getting in from the window.It was as if,there was something in the catsle that I didn't wanted them to find and I was fighting with all my heart to stop them for reaching to it.The other persons that were on my side helped me too.I remember in the last dream,I was on a vechile.I wasn't the driver but I was on it.It took me to this hiddebn antique place,and there I met the intruders..and I was fighting again.         PS.I don't know any material art and I'm the type of avoiding fighting as much as I can

20090304123811AAzAnIB	Social Science;Psychology	Am I reading too much into this. I want him back?	still love this man, I missed my chance with him a few times,he got cold, we work together but could avoid each other if we wanted. I never got in his face after initially (after a big fight) tried to talk to him and he was having none of it. It got to the point that he would see me and walk away. So I asked him if I had offended or hurt him afresh. He said no. the day we couldnt talk about how we felt about things was the day it was over between us. So we resumed workplace acquintance, then he got cold again. Then one of his female fan club turned really nasty on me and he did too, then she said something while he and I were talking and he was OK again. I got afraid something was going on between them and stepped away, but she got so hostile, in the end, I told him what was going down. He said he knew nothing about it. He has been nicer to me,not taking sides (that is why i liked him, he is very fair) but I dont know what to do? I still like him, but dont want to express that in case he thinks I am playing a game. I genuinely smelt a rat and cleared my name with him. But he is making an effort ( though holds back) to appear friendly again.Yet at other times, it's like he is making sure I don't get the wrong idea? I dunno what to do. Is it true or fair that a man will come after you again if he truly wants you? I don't want to make a fool of him or me by saying I still love you. I genuinely see him as an equal, but am afraid that by being loose about it and seeming not to love him, I am discouraging him maybe if he did like me still. See my insecurity meant I never really flirted or went for it like other women do. He feels sorry for me, I am sure of that, but he is trying. If he was afraid I would get into him, would he do even that? I mean if he sees me he tries to talk to me and I am responding?

20090304122056AAoaSAp	Social Science;Psychology	What makes people from the same group of friends behave so differently towards others?	So the skater group at my school consists of probably five main people. All of them, except for one, as far as I can see give everybody outside of their little group the cold shoulder, more than likely make fun of them and just be plain mean. But the one that doesn't is a very friendly, nice person that talks to everybody, and doesn't brag about the parties of the most popular girl in school, even though they are invited to them, but instead focus on playing hockey. How does this happen? How can this person be so real, without slipping into behaving the same way as the rest of their group? Their parents? Morals?

20090304123408AA6HFfK	Social Science;Psychology	What should i do my dreams didnt get fulfilled?	Since d age of 13 I lived in dreamworld. I dreamt about my would be husband n gave him a name called Aman. I dreamt abt him a lot, In everyday life i used to talk to him(obviously i only use to answer on his behalf to myself). Today I am 25. Past 12 yrs i kept dreaming about him like any other girl who would dream about her partner and kind of life she would lik to spend with him. I always wanted him to be sweet, caring stylish, concerned about his looks and dressing sense.      But now wen he actually has come into my life, he is just the opposite, though i like him a lot but he is just the opposite. He is not interested in any dressing sense. He is not at all stylish. He is jus the opposite of me.   Once a fren who was not aware about that he is my fiancee came and said tht he looks lik an uncle which hurt me the most. I felt that as if all my dreams were trampled under feet by someone.   I dont want to tell him all this as I dont want to hurt him. He likes me a lot and so do I but I dont want to hurt him.   Though I know things will never change in future also, does this mean my dreams will never come true?   For the past 12 yrs these dreams were only my strength, and i lived by them day and night, if these dreams didnt come true, my heart would break as if there is no point in living a life...   At the same time I dont want to hurt my fiancee because it is not his mistake that i dreamt so much and he is jus the opposite of what i wanted... What should i do?    i might sound foolish but I cant explain wht I am going through so jus ended up writing here.   Its not easy to come out of something which have been integral part of my life i.e. my dreams.   what should I do, i feel helpless..

Usually I don't even bother to notice them.      The other night I had a dream where my Grandmother showed up. I walked into a room to do something and she was sitting in a chair looking at me. I slowly approached her and asked what she was doing here and wasn't she suppose to be in heaven. She said no and that she was here. After that I hugged her and started choking up and crying. And then I woke up to find that I was really crying.      Usually something like this wouldn't affect me. But usually my dreams have no physical affect on my body, and this one did.      So I'm asking, what does this dream mean?      (Wow, sorry 'bout the length)

Check it out,the percent of paternity tests across America shows that more than 1 million (!) babies are from another man than the husband.   And that is only on those who are getting tests,and those who have been pregnant.   As you must know,the number of sex acts in order to have a pregnancy are way higher than those which became successful with pregnancy,and the number of those done with protected sex do not enter in the count,you can have easily the arithmetic...      Cases of Infidelity (and its Cuckolded nests resulting) are way higher a problem in Society than thought!      And that is only in the formerly assumed "innocent" and passive female side of the population,as men have been dumped in that laundry basket by the millions without the benefit of the doubt (or considering with whom...another woman?).But usually,they were tolerated with a grudge by the willing (or not)ignorance of their wives,gf's.Remember Hillary Clinton?Women have been all along too.Quietly,and relying on reputation.Men knew better.Two thieves know each other weaknesses.

20090304140224AAmBcNn	Social Science;Psychology	Hi :),  please can i get some advice,Thank You?	Well i have been having very low self esteem lately, i use to got to an LAUSD school, and changed to an 94% Asian population school, I am Latino.  I think were all great beings but being described as a minority and Latino frequently has lowered my self esteem. I am a very good student but Since my other school wouldn't teach math I'm having trouble, I can't seem to get a hold of Algebra 2 part B. Ii fell bad becuase i have the feeling I'm a dishonor. I love the acdemics and asians their very smart but many of the students there want to make me inferior because I'm Latino. My SELF ESTEEM IS LOW.
20090227072126AA6qUvw	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do YOU think its ok for a WOMAN to show a guy her "picture" over the internet, if she never met him before ?	At what point do you draw the line.  I mean,  the guy could be anybody.   He could be a rapist.  An axe murderer.   A pedophile.  Anybody.   You never know,  especially in this day and age.  But lets say that you   met a guy online.  And you show him your picture,  or your face.  You   really, like the guy,  but you never met him before.   Do you think that   this is ok given what can happen.  I mean,  of course most people online are perfectly normal people.  But you got a few maniacs running   around here,  stalking people and all.   So what is the deal ladies ?   Why did you show him your face ?   =)

20090304135332AAN5QR8	Social Science;Psychology	Terrible day at school...what to do?	Just sort of ranting. We're in CAPTs (Connecticut Academic Performance Testing) right now, and that part of today wasn't too bad actually. Editing and revising, I finished early, so I got to read some manga. But here's the thing.       In spanish today, we did a lot of partner work. I hate partner work, I just can't interact with people. I get so--for lack of a better word terrfied--and can't think, can't speak, can't breathe. I completely freak out, it's terrible.       After Spanish, I was walking with two of my friends. I didn't really say anything, and one friend (let's call her Lisa) says, "geez, you're antisocial today, aren't you?" And that really bothered me. I'm usually a pretty mild person but, I got really upset. My parents just...always say that when they're upset with me. I guess just the...terminolgy got to me.      Moving on, in history we had some guy come in to observe the class, you know how they do that sometimes. Well, he must've thought I wasn't paying attention or something, but he came over and was watching me, like, specifically me. I had been doodling at the time, but was paying attention. My teacher, I guess in order to show that I was paying attention, asked me a couple of questions and I just...panicked. It's not that I wasn't paying attention, I knew the answers, but I just...took awhile to get them out. Probablly made it seem like I hadn't been paying attention. But I feel bad. Really bad...like what if he gets in trouble because I was "goofing" off in class?       That was still bothering me when I got to gym, a terrible class for me. Lisa's in that class, and she wouldn't leave me alone. She kept asking what was wrong with me, because I seemed really weird today, etc, etc. I know she was just trying to be nice, and was probablly concerned about me, but I was still a bit pissed off about her comment earlier and just...I don't know. She's so like...over-protective all the time or something. It's getting really annoying...always in my business a little clingy. I know it's only because she cares but it just...gets to me...      Anyway, I finally get to gym. It's a terrible class, really. People I don't even know make fun of me, tease me...torment would be a better word. I don't even know who they are, and can't even guess at what I could have possibly done to make them hate me so much. But after 30min of that (shortened classes, due to testing), I felt about ready to cry. Lisa wouldnt' leave me alone after class either and just...I don't know. I was really upset, could hardly look at her, and I get angry sometimes when I'm upset.      And I actually did cry on the bus a bit...just...everything building up I guess...      I suppose my questions are...any advice? Today was just...terrible, and in retrospect most of it appears to be my fault, which just makes it worse. In my place what would you do? How can I tell Lisa that I just want her to give me some space sometimes? I know she's just concerned and trying to be a good friend, but it's really getting to me. And I know that sounds terrible, which is why I need a better way to put this.       Also, still worried about the whole history ordeal...afraid my teacher might get in trouble...what do you guys make of that? I'm really worried that he'll be upset...      Lastly, how can I survive gym? I absolutely loath that class.

(I ask this here because this is where the smartest yahoo answer people are!)       A few days ago, hub and I were putting in new flooring and renovating our bathroom. I was on and off my knees, cutting templates and painting trim, etc. At one point when I got up I had a terrible pain shoot through my left knee-it buckled on me for a moment and I tried to walk it off. It happened twice more and each time, I tried to walk it out. The next day my knee was sorta "catching" in the front when I would try to bend it and the pain behind my knee was bad. Now the pain behind my knee, right below the soft middle part is awful. There is no apparent bruising-maybe minor swelling-but the muscle is very hard and sore to the touch. I have to walk with my leg bent slightly. I've been trying to stretch it out-but really sore. Any ideas what I did and how to fix it?

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET
20090227073023AAmVj6K	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you agree or disagree with this ongoing 'affirmative action' for boys' education in the UK?	More girls pass the UK's 11-plus exam than boys, which is the measure of whether a child will be offered a place at a Grammar school (for bright children).      However, under the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act, the Government cannot offer more Grammar school places to girls, than to boys - it must offer the same number regardless of how many actual boys and girls pass the 11-plus exam.      The education system defends this decision by saying that girls are more mature at age 11, and thus have to pass a higher bar than the boys.      Girls perform around 10% better than boys at the 11-16 level of education, so it would be reasonable to assume that around 10% of bright girls are being discriminated against by this policy.        So - men and women of GWS - do you agree or disagree with this, and why?      And what are your thoughts about it in general?  :-)

20090227073050AA629vr	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Who can tell me the meaning of my weird dreams?	I have this dream, where there is a guy that I know and do not expect, interfere in the relationship between me and my boyfriend. and it felt so real that when I woke up, it left me with an uneasy feeling. I know it sounds nothing, but it's been happening to me for FIVE times including two days ago. and it's all similar...the situation as in time and places are different but the meaning and the emotion it left when you wake up is the same. And it's been happening for five times. Can anyone tell me if there's something to it? Coz I never really think about it, and it still came. Which is not really a good thing...

20090227074116AA7FBdG	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Having homosexual dreams, help?	For the past two consecutive nights i've been having homosexual dreams where i have intercourse with a man, and act completely comfortable while doing it.      I have nothing against homosexuals and in a way even applaud them for the courage they have to express they're ideas without fear.   But i am not gay. I would never have sex with a man. I've had 6 girlfriends so far in the past 4 years (im 17) and i've never felt any kind of attraction for a man. Another strange thing is that during the course of the dream, the man with which i am having sex with, seems to morph into my past girlfriends and back to a man. It's very strange and i've no idea what it means.    Help?
20090227074045AAdUxK6	Social Science;Psychology	What does my dream mean?	Im in my room, but it looks nothing like my room. this room has no color, just white and beige. I find a door in my closet, so i go in and i feel no fear. ( not typical of me) when i go in this secret room it looks like a basement with a huge window on the far wall. there is a small desk right next to the door, but it is covered in dust and has nothin on it. the room zig-zags and opens into a room that has white carpet and white walls, more like an attic now rather then a basement. theres a small childs bed that has no sheets or blankets and there are two boxes right next to it. i open a box and there are little boys clothes inside, but when i pick up a piece of clothing, the article seems to be frail and falls apart in my hands.    there are pictures in the box, its old pictures and they have a little boy in them, but the little boy is too far away to see his face. he looks about 3or 4.    i suddenly get the feeling there is another person in the room, and i feel very rushed to get out, and sudden emence fear. i go to the door and when i go out of the door into the rest of the house, i dont return to my room, i am downstairs and coming out of a closet in the hall. its my house, but there is no furniture in the house anymore.       ive had this reoccuring dream for the last two weeks, i keep awaking durring the dream, but so it took me about a week to finish the full dream, and then the whole dream reocccured un-interupted.
