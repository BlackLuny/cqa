de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	In order to choose a best answer, first of all you may want to consider reading all of the answers you got thoroughly and then decide which one is the best.    Then, just go back to your question and you will see the blue buttons of Choose as Best Answer next to each answerer. Pick the very one you think its the best, comment it and rate it and then its done.    In case you don't know how to get back to your own question, then just click on your photo (avatar) or your name and you will go to your profile page. Then scroll down and you will see there is a section with 4 tabs: My Answers, My Questions, My Starred Questions and My Watchlist. Click on the tab of My Questions and then click on the question you want to choose the Best Answer for.    But remember, you need to wait for at least 4 hours before choosing the Best Answer and if you havent chosen the Best Answer, the question you asked will automatically turn into Undecided Question and then it has to be voted by other Yahoo! Answers users to pick up the Best Answer for you.    Hope this helps.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	For your questions:  Wait 4-5 hours and the buttons to pick a Best Answers will show up.

Pick a question, vote on an answer. Get 1 point. Anybody at any level can vote for Best Answers.|`|IxoBFCpTaa	? Wait 4 hours  ?? Click blue rectangle under the answer you want to choose.

nD5Py2XTaa	The key element of making money through blogging is becoming an authority in a certain field.    Put in simple words, authority is the level of readership, followship and trust you get online. The bigger the authority you get, the more people will consider you to be an expert in the field you'll be blogging about.    From this point on, there are numerous way to earn money with your blog.    1. Attract advertisers of open a Google AdSense account;  2. Write sponsored articles;  3. Write payed reviews;  4. Sell articles to other blogs;  5. Use affiliate marketing techniques (promote other people's products for a share of the profits);  6. Sell products and services of your own, related to the field you're blogging about;  7. Blog flipping (Selling the blog after its value has grown enough to cover the initial investment and maintenance costs.    There are more ways to earn money by blogging, but the ones above are the most common ones, and basically, they all depend on how good you are at what you're blogging about. They all depend on your authority level.    Hope this helps,    Alex Cristache  Blogsessive.com - Blogging Tips|`|9VaWal2Daa	You build up a following......then rake in the ADVERTISING bucks.

OlfVNTuYaa	Sometimes it takes them a while to actually find what you ordered.    I've never had something not arrive from Amazon though. They're reliable.|`|482oQASHaa	Well Amazon.com like most stores always tells you, that if you order more then 3 items at once, then it's going to longer for you to give those items,  for they are not going to ship those items at the same times, so even though  you got the first email, saying  your order has been shipped you must wait for the other two emails. to tell you they just ship those other items. so don't worry your going to get  the items you order.    The 1st item you order should come in about 3 to 5, or 5-7 business day's from now, the other items, depending when they are shipped  will be just like the same, to 3 to 5 or 5-7 business days,  the free standard shipping takes way longer since it's free, so there not going to be rushing to ship that order|`|hJk9YZrAaa	Sometimes it takes a while.  Especially if you buy things from other shops that sell on Amazon.  It's important to always check the "Usually ships in...." line on the page for the item.

3I6q9ZgEaa	If your talking about the whole world its probably pretty small.     Considering that yahoo answers is mainly a US thing, and we only have 300 million people here, il speculate that only about half of the nation uses the internet regulary and only 1/4 owns a yahoo account and even less than that even use yahoo answers.    there are 6 billion people in the world. So your only talking about less than 5 percent of the world are using yahoo answers.    of course this is just a quick calculation.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Hi    Most of my friends (that use Yahoo!) haven't even HEARD of Yahoo!

QCPddhlUaa	Hi hope for the best,    Four hours after you've posted your question, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile page. Then scroll down to the green tab that says MY QUESTIONS. Click on this tab. It'll show all of the questions you've asked. Click on the question that you want to choose a best answer to. Underneath each answer for the question, there should be a large blue button that says Choose as Best Answer or something similar to that. Just click on this button. From there, you give a rating to the answer from 1 to 5 stars (1 being the worst, 5 being the best), and it is also recommended that you comment the answer you've chosen for the best answer - you can write something like "Thanks!"     You can choose a best answer to your question from anywhere between 4 hours and 4 days after you've asked it. However, after 4 days, your question will automatically go into voting. This means that other Yahoo! Answers users can vote for a best answer to your question instead. You can also vote for a best answer to your question - you get one point for this. However, if you choose a best answer to your question directly within the 4 hours and 4 days, you get three points!      And it's normal to feel lost on the site, especially since there are many parts to it. But soon you'll be a pro ;)     If you have any other questions, you are welcome to contact me through the email link provided on my profile.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	As you keep answering questions, since not every question you answered would get Best Answer, so you'd just have lower Best Answer percentage. For example, if you only have answered like 100 questions, but only one of them was chosen as Best Answer, so then you'd only have 1% Best Answer.|`|sDKCX43caa	Percentages vary as you answer questions.

It calculates the percentage based on how many questions you answer.  For example, if you answered 2 questions and 1 was the best answer, then you would have 50% best answers.  If you answered 2 more questions, making your total 4, then it would be 25% best answers.|`|uMTF3HXcaa	Because uve answered more questions and none of them  have been chosen as best answer therfore the percent goes down.now once some of those answers do get chosen as best answer the percent will go up.|`|TnPiiwoAaa	The more questions you ask the less best answers out of 100 you will have.

Your amount of best answers remains the same, your percentage just drops.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Usually YA issues this message when your e-mail account may have been hijacked and used for spamming. To find the spamming source and to make sure that it isn't you causing this, Yahoo has to temporarily shut down your mail account. During the suspension, you have access to all email in your inbox, personal folders and sent folder, and to your mail options. You will not be able to send or receive mail or save any drafts. Email sent to your account will bounce back to the sender.     Other probable causes      1: Somebody may have tried to enter your account without being authorized, and he may have tried to do so a couple of times. After a couple of failed attempts to open your mail account, Yahoo also temporarily shuts it down for security measures. In some cases a user may not even try to get into your account, but he may want to cause trouble for you - he just knows that after a couple of seemingly unauthorized attempts to enter your account, Yahoo shuts it down for a couple of days. Often an automated program is used for this which can send more than 1000 requests a minute. The Yahoo servers detect that a human can't be behind such attempts and presto, the account is shut down.    What you can do is go to: http://login.yahoo.com/config/login . After your first try you'll probably get a failure message, but when you try again, you'll see a captcha link. Only real life people could handle this correctly, spambots can't read it. If you are lucky, you may be able to enter your account at this point.     2: If you send large amounts of mail, even if it is for non-profit organizations, Yahoo may close your account temporarily because their program can't tell the difference between a supposed spammer and a real one.    Yahoo Customer Service Info: 866-562-7219 or 408-349-3300  Yahoo Personal Email: 866-492-4664 (small fee)  Yahoo Small Business: 866-562-7219

Unscrupulous thieves have sent you this email and they are trying to part you from your hard earned cash. They will often ask you to call a premium rate number and keep you holding on whilst you rack up a huge phone bill. They are then paid a large proportion of this phone bill. They may ask you to divulge personal information about yourself or ask for your bank or credit card details. Do not divulge any such information under any circumstances. It is surprising how many innocent victims have been duped by these types of emails. Please remember the thieves who send them are very clever and extremely convincing.

If it asks for your account details it is almost certainly someone trying to get into it, as no reputable bank would ask for these details online. The most obvious giveaway in those sent to me was the terrible grammar, even though the rest of the page was copied from the legitimate site.  Of course, ask your bank to be sure, but I would recommend trhat you don't send your details to anyone.

Answers employee Jane said;"These limits help new members get to know a bit more about Yahoo! Answers before they start just asking and answering like crazy. While it may seem really restrictive sometimes, it can also help new members realize what questions are worth more to answers rather than just answering a bunch of polls. If you aren't already, be sure to vote on undecided questions also. Not only will this help good answers be rewarded, but it will also help you progress to the next level more quickly."

on6dC4A8aa	places like monster.com can lead you to legitimate jobs, but you have to know how to screen them--there are scams and employment agencies on there described as jobs too. From what I've seen there are about twice as many ads on there from employment agencies and questionable-sounding work-at-home deals---what I'd do is search for the jobs & apply individually rather than just putting your resume and contact info out there because you'll get a lot of BS calls.

suPD7c3gaa	All they did was copy the image, paste and move it up slightly.  I can't give you detailed instructions as you don't say what photo editing application you would be using.|`|1CABRATlaa	You can do that in Screen Dash.  Its the only photo editor that can take screenshots, do paint and photo editing, and host images.  Thus, you can share images with your friends and family.    All you do is upload the photo you want then use the image tool on the left side.  Insert the new image, it will make it transparent then just slide it a little off center.|`|WiTBXCYvaa	Zynr is right, they just duplicated and moved stuff around vertically. Send me a picture, to my SN at yahoo dot com, and I can do the same for you.
f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	You would have to set up a personal "Filter", to re-direct incoming mail (from a designated address), to a separate folder, instead of the inbox.    Mail page>>options (top right)>>mail options (if available)>>scroll to and click on "Filters"---and click "add".    It's pretty much self explanatory, but basically----you enter (in the "from header line"), the exact address you want to re-direct----choose a folder (or make a new one here)----then click "add filter".    This tutorial should answer any questions you have about working with filters.  http://help.yahoo.com//us/tutorials/cg/m...

WBMT62ceaa	Depends on if it's static or dynamic. Sometimes just disconnected (if you use software to connect) or leaving the modem unplugged will cause your IP lease to expire. You may get a new IP address then.    It sounds as if you want to abuse this though, for whatever reason... in which case I would recommend TOR (the onion router).|`|QDEId9Asaa	you can get a ip masking program    most routers do it  well modern ones     and there are some downloadable programs that change ur IP|`|QRcBM5PZaa	ip shadow?|`|6qnadDHyaa	you have to get a new internet provider, its like switching phone companies

f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	It could be your choice of browser.  When Yahoo updated the original mail page, they changed that feature to only work on a few (2 to be exact) "supported" browsers.  This link, from Yahoo, gives details and a list of the supported browsers.  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/address...      In the meantime>>>insert addresses by clicking on the word "TO" (in the composing page), and your mailing list opens.  Check all the addresses you want to send to and then click the "insert checked contacts".

AA11307940	Yahoo free mail does not provide that service, Yahoo Mail Plus, Outlook Express and others have it, but you pay for it, then the recipient needs to have the same capability and willingness to click received.|`|cnmpn0f8aa	No, it's not.  You'd have to invade another person's database to get the info.    In theory you could receive a confirmation if the person you've sent the e-mail has a program that sends confirmations when his or her e-mail is opened... But people tend to like privacy, so I doubt they'd be willing to use those kinds of programs.
pqSEIgVbaa	Add a read receipt to your message and you will get a message letting you know when the message has been read.|`|AA11307940	Yahoo free mail does not provide that option. Yahoo Mail Plus, Outlook Express and others have it but you pay for it. Then the recipient needs to have the same capability and willingness to click received, since spammers also use that feature, it's a personal thing to each user.
5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Forgot your yahoo password click link for help.  https://edit.yahoo.com/forgot?login    You will need the following:   1. The zip/postal code you gave when you registered for the account non-U.S.  residents, please include country.   2. Your birth date.   3. The alternate (non-Yahoo) email address listed for your Yahoo ID. If you don't enter an alternate email address for your account, you will only be able to receive a new password by providing the Secret Answer to the Challenge Question you entered during registration. If you forget the answer to your Challenge Question and do not have an alternate email address listed on your account, you will not be able to receive a new password.
WBMT62ceaa	Use a strong password, a secret question with NO answer (eg. "fkjhfdkjhdfuhruir").    Finally check that you don't have a keylogged installed on your machine, if this person is someone who had physical access to your machine or that you'd run an .exe file from them (possibly sent through email to you).    Keyloggers can be installed remotely when you run an executable file sent to you.
AA11307940	Not with Yahoo free mail, it doesn't provide that service. Yahoo Mail Plus, Outlook Express and others have it but you pay for it. Then the recipient needs to have the same capability and willingness to click received. It's a personal thing since scammers and spammers also use it.
f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	You can delete them all at once if you switched to "All New Mail". (just for that purpose).  It has a continuous mail page which allows you to delete en mass. Click on "more actions" ---then "check all" and then "delete".  You can switch back to Classic afterward.    Otherwise, with Classic, it's page by page.   BUT------ you can speed it up by changing the "messages per page" to 200 instead of 25. That makes it 8 times faster, with 200 at a time.     Mail page>>options (top right)>>scroll to and click on "general preferences". Now, go down to *Folders/Search Results* and change the number in the box----then click a blank space (outside the box), to set the number, (so it won't roll to a different number), while you scroll to the bottom of the page to click "save".|`|f30GLmzmaa	if u want to delete all of them on the top of the indox should be a little box the says select all check it and then click delete

RhkKGsipaa	Click start lower left on your desk top, then click control panel then double click sounds and audio devices. Click audio tab ensure your speakers and mic are the default devices do the same with the voice tab. If not change them and click o.k. You can also check your equipment while you are there. Also click actions top line of the messenger window, scroll down and run voice setup. Also click messenger top left, scroll down and click preferences then scroll down and click webcam where you can make adjustments, click o.k. To make sure it is o.k. click messenger top left, scroll down and click my webcam. and your webcam should come on. You should also run your call setup. Click actions top row of the messenger window scroll down click call setup and follow the prompts. When you are chatting with someone click on webcam in the chat window. I hope that is of some help. My own opinion is that if you are going to webcam regularly download windows live messenger to me it is far better than Yahoo messenger     http://get.live.com/messenger/features

q5TchS9jaa	what the Hell are you talking about? You might use photo shop.
MeeJWmGtaa	No; because I'm using Adium, a messenger program for Macs that supports both Yahoo and MSN, as well as many other protocols.|`|FbDNvdeaaa	I have had the problem intermittently over the course of years that I have used Messenger.  Interestingly, for me anyway, a simple force quit ('option'+'command'+'escape') fixes the issue every time.      Recently I thought I had the need to uninstall and reinstall messenger 2009-Jan20.  I just happened to check and imagine my surprise to find a newer version of messenger available for the OS X platform.  The newest I found was Yahoo Messenger 3.0 beta build 126432.  Apparently it was released 2008-Dec6.  You might try using this version if you are not already.    It is disappointing to me that there isn't some notification of these updates.    Should this update not fix the problem, a complete uninstall of Messenger, including preferences files is the next thing.  Should you need to do this, drag the Messenger app to the trash.  There are two preferences files.  They will be found in the 'user' 'library' not 'system' 'library'.  So, navigate to 'computer name' > 'hard drive name' > 'users' > 'your user name' > 'library' > 'preferences'.  Locate two files named:  com.yahoo.messenger3.plist (if using messenger 3) and com.yahoo.messenger3.Users.your Yahoo Messenger Handle.plist.  Drag both to trash.  Empty trash. Restart Mac.  Install Messenger.  WARNING!!! deleting preferences files means you will be starting fresh with the Messenger app and you will have to reestablish all your preferences and your budz' icons / avatars will not show up again until they and you are signed on at the same time.  Hope this helps.

SJX3jMh9aa	If you got a modded xbox 360 then do this.    - Go to the harddrive and reformat it.    - NEVER put a burned 360 game into the player.    By doing this there will be no modded files on the harddrive.  You may still have a hacked firmware but provided you don't play burnt 360 games you will be fine :)
