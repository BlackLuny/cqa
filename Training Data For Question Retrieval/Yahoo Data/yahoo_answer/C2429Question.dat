20090220220202AA65xit	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you guys like this poem I wrote....?	The Answer      Everyone is searching,   for an answer or a light,   So when their search is over,   They can say that "I am right."      But when you find your answer,   You assume its the only truth.   A single solution to a million questions   Your answer's only right to you.      So much war and bloodshed   To settle who is right and who was dumb,   On the big questions of the unknown,   Like where we all came from.        Scientists believe,    That rationality is what's right.   While creationists have faith in their god,   To seal their eternal life.      Who is right and who is wrong?   Humanity might never find out.   Until the answer is made clear.   The best attitude is doubt.

20090220220339AA3OpHD	Arts & Humanities;History	Did Rome really fall? Or was it absorbed into the Byzantine Empire?	Please give me your thoughts on this. Please make the legitimate and not based off of fiction and fantasy.      Please don't just say because a textbook said it. Give me your thoughts. Historians right now aren't as sure. There are arguments for it such that Byzantines considered themselves Roman and continued the linage of the Roman Empires.. etc. Or if you do not believe in this. Give me you reasons!       Give any sources used including websites/books so I can look further into your answers. It will be much appreciated =)!

I forget rosy cheeks   Always carry daggers   And forge moist lies   With adulterous lips      I'll build a fire on the coastline   And make what I can of the rocks.

Well, I'm drawing an art piece for my class and I've drawn a really random piece that has nothing to do with anything really.      I've drawn dragonflies, hummingbirds, stars, hearts, flowers and swirls. So I guess my overall topic is "Happy" or anything that would symbolize "happy" or "cute".

If anybody has any tips, suggestions, and recommendations for agencies would really be appreciated. Oh and any agencies that would be in the L.A. area would be best. So thank you in advanced and for your time.

His eye's roll up, his mouth a'yawn   he rises thus to greet the new dawn   with creeking of knees and groaning of back   he shuffles and shoulders his old gunny sack      A cup of hot tea, some apple and cheese   out the back door quick as you please   headed away out beyond the back fence   heeding some call and hurrying hence      Through the deep wood and cross the cool rill   down through the glen and over the hill   up through the high meadow all abuzz with bees   under the shade of an ancient oak tree      there he unpacks his old bag with great care   laying his paints here, his canvases there   a bottle of wine, a thin loaf of bread   a jar of green olives and a blanket to spread      There in the shade of that grand ancient tree   a girl young and fair he has come far to see   she waits there for him though her father forbade   to pose for his paintings and make love in the shade.
20090220221806AAkiO4p	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What is your favorite Robert Frost poem?	Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost   Whose woods these are I think I know.   His house is in the village, though;   He will not see me stopping here   To watch his woods fill up with snow.   My little horse must think it queer   To stop without a farmhouse near   Between the woods and frozen lake   The darkest evening of the year.      He gives his harness bells a shake   To ask if there is some mistake.   The only other sound's the sweep   Of easy wind and downy flake.   The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   But I have promises to keep,   And miles to go before I sleep,   And miles to go before I sleep.

20090220223041AAf7lh9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Reality or a fiction short story?	These to genres I feel comfortable in writing for my short story assignment, but we have to do one!      The reality:   This story is from a woman's point of view who had been through child labour, when she was a young village girl. She ran away from her work, and with luck and destiny, she is able to learn and educate herself. From then on, she fights those who take these innocent children away from their parents to work. (So, I basically write about what happens to her when she was a child, and how she escaped)      The fiction:    This is about a suspicious girl and her friend (the girl is 14 and the guy 15) who think life is just ordinary. They read so many fantasy books and feel it might happen to them! Yet when all hopes are lost, it does happen (but I;m not sure what happens; that is associated with these words: destiny, forest, whisper, secret letter and a knock!      It would be nice if you could help me with the plot of the fiction too!      Please help me choose.      (The reality story is the first I thought of, I usually think of fiction)

I would really appreciate feedback, thanks so much!   JULIE’S WORDS   PREFACE   I see blue. Blue everywhere. Women in light blue dresses, men in navy blue suits with turquoise ties.    It was Clarke’s idea to begin with. It was, of course, Julie’s favorite color. There are blue exotic flowers to match, along with blue tissues, which seem to be almost gone. The Power Point screen behind me glows blue, for the final slide. It’s a picture of Julie, the one that was taken when she won Nationals. She’s wearing a turquoise leotard. Dad put the slide show together.    I was seriously about to lose it, but I kept talking. Talking about Julie. Mom cried at funerals for people she didn’t even know, so it was a no-brainer that she would cry at Julie’s.    But when I look up at Mom, she’s smiling. There’s a twinge of a tear, lost in her eye, but I can tell, that she’s done crying. We had all cried for nearly four months. Now the crying was ending. Today. At Harrison Funeral Home.    Out of the corner of my eye, I see Alicia Greene. Her mom, Ally, is comforting Lily, my sister, in the bathroom, who is wailing. Alicia looks confused and sad. My brain shifts over to the previous summer, in which my sister had spent nearly every day at the pool, laughing her guts out with Alicia Greene. But now, Alicia looks ashamed. Ashamed because she thinks it’s all her fault. Which might be easy to believe, but it isn’t. Alicia is just as much to blame as anyone else, besides the two creeps who did this to Julie. They’re serving fifteen years in jail. Trial had been the previous weekend.    Next, I think of the color blue; and how it’s not really a color. It’s an emotion. And I’m not talking about when people are sad, they can just say that they are ‘feeling blue’. Because blue isn’t just sad. Blue is happy. Blue is confusion.    Blue is a bittersweet secret. Like how only a fraction of the people in this funeral home know that there is no body lying in the mahagony coffin at the front of the room. Me, being one of them.    My speech ends, and everyone applauds. I know what they thought of it. It was very pleasant, and a little touching, but probably only because I’m Julie’s sister. I didn’t say anything people wouldn’t expect me to say. I’m not a good public speaker, but I did it for Julie. Plus, Mom, Dad, and Clarke all voted that I speak instead of them.    We all head to the foyer in the next room, for tea and cookies. Lily and Mrs. Greene walk slowly out of the bathroom. Lily’s face is tear-stained, and a strand of strawberry-blonde hair is matted against her cheek. Her green eyes are swollen and red. Her dress is ruffled.    From descriptions, Lily looks like Julie. But she doesn’t. Julie’s eyes were rounder and her nose was a bit larger, her lips were thinner, and her hair was thicker and more curly.    Even Mrs. Greene looks depressed. Her eyes are red. My dad rushes up to them, thanks Mrs. Greene, and takes Lily by the hand.    As for me, I left the funeral home. I walked outside and sat on the curb. Julie did the same thing after our grandfather’s funeral.    “Sometimes, if the sky is really blue, and there aren’t any clouds, you can talk to Grandpa. But you have to be quiet, and do it in your head. And he’ll hear you.” I remember Julie saying. Her sweet voice whispering in my ear sounds so real and frightening, that I actually turned to see if she was sitting next to me.    But of course, she wasn’t.    I looked at the sky. It was blue. Not a single cloud.    Most people would say that this was normal on an August day in Alabama. But I felt such a surge at that moment, that I had to believe that it was a sign. I was supposed to talk to Julie.    Julie, I got your messages. I though in my head. I just read a speech at your funeral, which was probably the scariest thing I’ve ever done. But I’m glad you made me do it Julie, because I actually enjoyed it. I miss you. I love you. Goodbye, Julie.    A lonely, blue tear fell into my lap.      good. I would really appreciate any feedback. Thanks!

20090220173835AAzWtsH	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	I'm sorry... I'm a 14 year old newbie   That day: A poem by me.   One day you told me you could not stay.   One day you told me to go away.   I thought, at first,  it was for the best,   But i couldn't move on and see the rest.   Each day you're gone, I start to wounder:   why did you leave, you left me to sunder.   The years go by, as me heart breaks in two   You did away with me, what do i do?      three years have gone by, I still don't see why;   "He thinks It'll get better," I said with a sigh.   It's not getting better; It's just getting worse.   I'm still alive, and baring this curse.   I'll live till the end, and when these wunds heal    I'll find out some how to pass the deal.      The messege will come, come into view   And when that day comes, I'll get over you.

Published by Random House   Manufactured in Cali, Colombia   Library of Congress Catalog Number: 73-13472.      This is an old book, and looks to be from about the 1960s or so.

20090220181408AA3I9tZ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like my speech? Please give advice....?	I know iv already asked this but i didnt get many answers      Ok so heres the speech i wrote. I wanna know any suggestions. B.T.W im 13 and in the 8th grade. Rate on a scale of 1-10 please:      It all starts with one. One person. One citizen of the world, just like you, and me. One person, who’s ready for change. One person who is ready to stand up and make a difference. One person, who cares about the global community, and wants to make life better, for the people of the world. It starts with 1 person, and changes the world.       Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Every generation of people has had a problem faced before them. Years ago, African Americans had to fight for their right to be considered as equals in our society. Years ago, women fought for their rights to vote, and be of importance in our world. Now not just global citizens but residents of our own country are living in poverty. The world is calling for our help! This is our turn, our time, to change the world.      It was the great Mahatma Gandhi who once said “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” It takes an action to create change. I look around and I can see that everybody wants to make change, wants to make a difference in the world. Everybody has the desire, to make a difference, though we often put barriers in front of ourselves. We think that it’s too hard. We think that we don’t have enough time. We think that we are too young, too old to make a difference. Because of these barriers that we are constantly placing in front of ourselves, our desire to make a difference never gets put to action. Imagine if we all removed those barriers in front of us. If we all worked together, as a community, what a change we could make in the world, what a difference we could make, what a great place the world could be.       Education, is a foundation, the first steps, what we need to live a better life. Unfortunately, millions of children simply cannot go to school. These children could be in a school, receiving the education they need, but can’t. Some of these children are forced to work in sweatshops, put in dangerous situations, making very little money, when they could be in a classroom. Some of these children, are forced to be child soldiers, without a choice, fighting for something that they are against, forced to fight family members, friends. It’s hard to imagine, this happening to children, simply because they cannot afford it, not able to have everyday things we take for granted.      At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. People are living without a place to call home, without the amount of food they need to survive. Many of these people have to live on the streets, because they cannot afford even a small place to live in. Some of these people die; from diseases they don’t even know about, diseases they could have prevented. These people do not have access to clean drinking water, and are risking their health every time they simply take a drink. Imagine if this was you. Imagine being on your own, waking up in the morning and not knowing if you will survive another day. This is life for so many people of the world, It’s time to give these people help, give them a future, its time to change life for these people in our world.      Making a difference doesn’t have to be a difficult thing. It can be as simple as holding the door for somebody, giving somebody a smile. Buying a coffee for someone. These little things may not seem like much, but can make a difference. It doesn’t matter if you are doing little things, or big, if your helping people in your own community, or helping people of the global community. You’re making a difference. Little steps can lead to bigger steps and soon enough we will be making lives better, improving the world.       Today, I challenge you, to remove the barriers you place in front of yourselves. I challenge you to take action. It doesn’t have to be big! I challenge you to do something, anything, to change the world. I challenge you to get the community involved, the more people who help, and the more people who strive towards the goal, the bigger the action becomes. It seems like such a big challenge, such a big goal, but if we work together then the easier it will become to reach our goal, the easier it will become to make a difference.      It all starts with one, starts with one to make a difference, starts with one to create an action, so go out, be that one, be that leader, and make a difference, to change the world.

Emotions damned for years have gained a voice.   Mute fears, dead hopes, my rage have all left tracks   when pen to paper offered me no choice.      The crack of a slap!   Scorpion stung lies,   Ignored tears   never learned to flow till now.      Write these recollections, end the pain.   This hated mask is slipping from my face.   Proclaim my freedom, crumbling shackles fall,   these memories slip through discrete small cracks.

20090220183045AA62IsL	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A Good Book to Read (I'm currently working on the Twilight series)?	Enough said in the actual question part. Just wanted to say that I don't necessarily want any vampire books just because the Twilight series is about vampires! (Unless you have read a vampire book that you really enjoyed that you would like to recommend.) I wanted to ask if anybody knew any books like Twilight, books that they really enjoyed that kept them flipping pages. :)

I am trying to find a story about a girl who is really mean and one day someone smacks her in the face with a lunch tray and gives her a bloody nose. She goes home and writes all over herself in green marker/crayon and then gets in the bathtub where it all washes off and turns the water green (I supposed this is like a cleansing process because she comes out a nice person). Those are all the details I can remember!! I have googled those keywords over and over again but can't find anything.
20090220194231AAUgN2l	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	"The Invitation", a poem...Just sharing with everyone, hoping you'll enjoy it & share your thoughts... ?	"The Invitation"         It does not interest me what you do for a living,   I want to know what you ache for,    and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.      It does not interest me how old you are   I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love,   for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive.      It does not interest me what planets are squaring your moon,   I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow,   if you have been opened by life's betrayals    or have become shriveled, bitter and closed from fear of further pain.       I want to know if you can sit with pain, yours or mine    without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.      I want to know if you can be with joy, yours or mine,   if you can dance with wildness and let ecstasy fill you   to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us    to be careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of being human.      I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself;   If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul      I want to know if you can see beauty, even when it is not pretty every day,    and if you can source your life from “its” presence.      I want to know if you can live with failure, yours or mine   and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, YES!      It does not interest me to know where you live or how much money you have   I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair,   weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done for the ones who love you.      It does not interest me who you are, how you came to be here   I want to know if you will stand in the center    of the fire with me and not shrink back.      It does not interest me where or what    or with whom you have studied   I want to know what sustains you from the inside    when all else fades away      I want to know if you can be alone with yourself,   and if you truly like the company you keep   in the empty moments.         By Oriah Mountain Dreamer
20090220184436AAZCeYY	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	History/Acting (Les Miserables) Question?	My director for our school musical, Les Miserables, has given me an assignment, along with four other girls.  In the barricades scene in the show, the four girls and I are supposed to be acting as nurses.  We know that when someone gets shot, we need to take care of them.  But our director is looking for a little more depth than that.  For anyone who has been in Les Miserables and has had my job in the barricades scene, can you give me any advice on what we should do when someone playing a student gets wounded?      Also, I am opening this question to those who know anything about what nurses would do in a battle such as the one in the show.  The battle takes place in 1832 in France, so that might help.  What would a nurse do for a wounded soldier/student?

20090220184217AA4Ik8o	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Should we write it for TV or print?	I am co-authoring a fantasy story with a friend, and we're butting heads a little on how it should be written. I am a novel writer, and he is a screenplay writer. Obviously, we each want to stick to our comfort zones; however, I imagined the story, though long an involved, eventually being marketed for the silver screen. He argues that it should, due to its length, be written as a TV series, end of discussion.      I would boot him off of the project (since I came to him with the idea in the first place), but I asked for his help for a reason. Do I man up and tell him it's being written as a novel and risk losing his help and insight, or do I compromise the versatility of the manuscript, and in my opinion, its integrity as well, just to suit his writing style and slightly clashing vision of its future?

20090220194630AAcrXR8	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Would this poem make you cry?	Hi i'm 15 and    never have i thanked my mum. standing by me through everything. i have never told her how i feel about her. I was a twin, but my twin died a few months into the pregnancy. the doctor sudjested she got the area cleaned out, but she said no and that saved my life. They never knew i was there until she got another ultra-sound. And here i am. my mum saved my life. I'm forever grateful. i wrote this to give to her for her birthday.    So today my question is:      If you were a mother and your child wrote this poem for you, would it make you cry?            You gave me life, I will never forget      The undeniable love, From my first breath         You're my mum, Always here for me      The one I love, You set me free         You're my savior, You kept me here      Ignored the doc. Against all fear         You're always around, Watching me grow      My gratitude for everything, I never do show         Your gift of life, I hold dear      For without you, I wouldn't be here         You're my mum, So precious to me      My love for you, I hope you can see         Thankyou mum for everything you have done.

20090220193505AAVxPJp	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem any good?	The first four lines are meant to be personification. I am personifying the abyss, they also serve as abstractions and alliteration       This abyss is in my soul forever,   Suffocating the walls of solitude,   Swallowing the sorrow of the past.   This abyss of my life is like the panting;   The panting of canine breath,   Always struggling to find the air.   But, alas, I am the chosen son.   My father has my faith wrapped up,   With all the sparkles filed up in white.   The folder of my likeness took,   The knowledge never gained, never believed,   Not known to be written in any book.   However, no matter the graveness,   Imagination gives the power of gods.   Had I to believe in such despondency   I would love the lord, savior, and chosen one…   But what is there to believe, but you, yourself.   Am I just another page to be burned,   Or the product of family times wealth?   I do not want things to plague my existence.   I do not need the golden doors, white walls,   Nor any sort of picket fence, Truth!   Give me truth and I will show you me;   Give me lies and I act like a stapler,   Squeezing your lips together so tight.   The words spit blood, not to come out.   I do not need your empathy, or good grace,   Give me honesty and originality,   And I will show you my truest face, I say!   But where is the light in this abyss?   I still see these shadows piling up the sides,   As they sing, “Hello Child, Here we are,   Hello our leech and food for all.”   I their food for all the lonesome nights,   Fidgeting madly, never asleep, never here,   Never there, never anywhere, but dead…   Dead with the numbness I do have, joy…   Joy to knowing, I be safe, Safe in the caverns,   Safe in my longing, longing for truth,   Longing for what’s real in this terrific place.

It's like, you read an adventure novel, and you know that the main character is going to survive, the question is how.      You read a romance novel, and you know that the boy and the girl are going to end up getting together, the question is how, or when.       If someone wrote a book where...the main character dies, but what his or her actions, the reason that the person died is remembered and inspires someone else to take on the challenge that they did, would you read it?      or if there was a novel where the guy and girl don't get together?

20090220185654AAjQ5YT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A title for a short story - boy with autism?	Hi, have written a short story (about 2500 words) and it is about a boy who has autism from the age of four. He is really smart, especially at mathematics. He meets this girl who is also smart and they get along well. They are both known across Australia because of their smartness. One morning they are kidnapped by terrorists situated in Brisbane. Both the kids have two work out this equation, and the answer will give the terrorists the code to activate the bomb they have. If they don't figure it out in 1 hour they will get shot. They complete it and then army commandos come in and takes control of the situation.  Ideas on a title for this short story will be appreciated. Thanks

I read it three years ago and loved it.  What I hate are the people who saw the movie or read the books because of the movie and now call themselves ultimate TRUE fans.  The same thing happened to Harry Potter (which I also love but will never join the pathetic hype for it) and it seems like its happening again for Confessions of  Shopaholic.      Is it just me, or are others noticing this pattern?  Is anyone else as pissed about it as I am?

Outlines of a uphill battle I was facing .      Indecisive her looks,   at times she was happy .   My love for her robbed like crooks .   I broke the border knowing this would happen .      Too far to pull back .   Too back to feel near .   My feelings derelict , dealing with my pain and fear .      Shameful, she was unperceptive .   Locked in by Americas criteria .   Inside our world there is a new world with some of the greatest personalities god has given .      Beauty at times must mature .   No degree or paper could produce it .   It lives in every organism from the sky to sea .   Blinded at times by a arrogant scent . . .

There's an addict, the self-centered type and one of the characters has had to deal with abuse and violence. Sorry if the description is vague or not enough, it's better than it sounds.

20090220211123AABeF0R	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How is the first chapter of my story?	I know people are getting sick of these types of questions, but I'm really looking for some constructive criticism. Something that I hardly ever get. Sorry about the length, I tend to write relatively long chapters... I also don't have any of the html stuff like italics and bold either, but that should deviate to much from it:      My name is Casey Jenkins, the year is 2010, and I live in the United States which has just recently been taken over by vampires. Yes, you read that right… vampires, as in blood-drinking, undead, evil creatures of the night. Though, it’s not just the United Sates, the entire world is now under their control as well.      Humans did try to fight, of course, but the fight that ensued was so short that it can’t even be considered a war since it only lasted a couple of months; not nearly long enough to earn the title of ‘war’. It was a pitiful one really; no amount of man-made weaponry could even come close to equaling the brute force and strength of the vampires. They were ruthless as well, and had no qualms in killing thousands of humans who tried to get in their way. This was such a scary time for those of us who had nothing do with the fight mostly because we had no idea what was going on half the time, there was no radio or TV coverage and the newspapers were also scarce.      The only time we were sure of what was going on was when the vampires took complete control and announced their victory by any means that they could. They took over the governments of every country and killed those who had been the leaders prior to the take-over.      It’s weird, but nothing changed really… at least not at first. We weren’t really kept up to date about the happenings, but it was obvious that they were planning something, something really big… something that was going to change mine and every other humans’ (the ones that were still alive at least, the fight had killed thousands) life forever.      It all started when I arrived at school on January 5, 2010… the halls were much emptier than I remembered them being just the day before. My homeroom class was missing a total of thirteen students; nearly half of the class was gone. What was even weirder was the fact that some teachers were missing as well, including my homeroom teacher, Mrs. Wilson.      When I stepped into the classroom at 7:40, five minutes before the bell rang. It was so strange because the room was usually crawling with thirty students this close to the bell. It was dead, a total of sixteen people, not including myself, were in the room that morning. That was a huge clue that something was happening… it was not a coincidence that the vampires took over only a few weeks before and all of sudden a bunch of people were missing.      I was standing there in the doorway, with my mouth gaping open when the principal, Mr. Wells, stepped in behind me, and cleared his throat rather loudly. I moved out of his way as he stepped into the room and made his way to the front of the classroom. Those of us in the room simply watched him as he made his way to the front.      “I’ve been instructed to pass copies of this out to everyone.” he explained as he began handing out sheets of paper. When he handed me one, I glanced down at it, it was a letter:      ‘To everyone who is reading this, you are probably wondering where most of your classmates are… they’ve been taken under the strict orders by the Vampire King himself. But, just so you don’t all feel left out… you too, at some point, will be taken away from everything you’ve ever known to start a new life. There will be no warning; this is the only warning you will be receiving. There will be no escape from it. If you choose to fight you will not win. If you run, you will be found and the punishment will be most severe. Once again, this will be your only warning. Heed it and prepare yourself for the inevitable.      Vincent de Roulet   The High Chancellor   Head of the Vampire Council      I stared at the note with wide eyes. So, that is what they had been planning… kidnapping humans and doing God knows what with them. I found it rather odd that we were given a warning in the form of a note since half the school didn’t have that luxury. Though, I was just thankful that we were given a clue as to what was happening… it made me scared all the same… what were they kidnapping us for anyway? Why couldn’t we just go about living under their control?      So many questions and no answers… not that I was surprised; it appeared that they liked to keep us in the dark, which they were still able to do even if they had given us some idea as to what to expect. The letter didn’t explain everything that was going on.      And that’s what truly scared me.      And it was that note's fault that made it very hard for me to sleep for I was so terrified that they would be coming for me… I probably could have attempted to leave, to escape my fate, but I knew that it would do no good. That thought alone was what kept me at home, lying in bed ni

20090220225125AAj92YE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Short story, opinions greatly appreciated!?	“Black coffee please,” I said handing over the two dollars due in exchange for it. The clerk handed me a warm cup.    “Come again,” she said mechanically. I turned and headed towards the big comfortable chair in the corner. Just as I was about to sit a man in a sleek, clean cut suit slid into it.    “It’s taken,” he said in a scaly voice, looking pleased with himself he leaned back into the cushions as if to rub it in. I rolled my eyes and sat in one of the wooden chairs by the window. A waitress came out and took an order at the table behind me.    “Coffee with sugar and a scone please,” said a women in a nasally voice. The waitress continued onto a few more tables and then retreated to the back.     I read my newspaper and sipped my coffee. Olympic Swimmer caught using Marijuana!, I read, not anything that interested me. Most these reporters had probably tried it at one time or another as well. Why were they reaming someone out for it? People today!, another title screamed from the page.  I began to read.     The author ranted about how people on a train ride she had taken yelled and screamed across the train, where there were clearly people sleeping. The train was packed and a women with a walked boarded. There were people sitting in the handicapped seat and they stayed there. The poor woman was left standing for the entire ride until someone finally stood and offered her a seat. As I finished the article, the waitress reappeared from the kitchen.    She placed a coffee cup on the table in front of the nasal woman. A few moments later, when the waitress was busy with other customers, there was a scream from behind me.    “EWWWW! What is this! There is milk in my coffee! Waitress! Waitress!” her voice gave me a headache. The waitress rushed over.    “Yes, yes, I’m sorry miss! I must have mixed up the order. I’ll get you a new cup right away!” The waitress was small to begin with and she shrunk even more as the woman began to scream again.    “You shouldn’t be a waitress! If you mess up orders you should be fired! Where is your manager? You are going to loose your job! I’ll make sure of it!” that’s when I got up and left as quickly as possible. My faith in people had been drained long ago, but this is what completely dried it up.     On the way home I stopped for gas, the man asked for my credit card and I reached for my wallet. It wasn’t in my bag. I checked a second time, then a third. I ran my hands over all of my pockets twice and checked my jacket. It was nowhere. I left the gas station and sped back to the coffee shop. It wasn’t on the table, and when I asked the manager he said nothing had been seen or turned in.      I drove carefully on the way home, so as not to be pulled over for any reason. I didn’t need to be caught without a driver’s license. I would have to get a new one.     My dad took me the next week to do so, when we got home there was a package on the front step.    “It’s for you,” my dad said, picking it up. He handed it to me and headed into the house. I followed and opened it on the counter. There was only one item in the package, my wallet. I looked inside, all the money was there, all of my cards and my driver’s license. Nothing was missing, not even the money to pay for mailing it.    I flipped over the package. I wanted to send a thank you note to the person,  and the money that was owed them. The handwriting was scribbled, illegible. There was no way to read what it said. I sighed and placed the wallet into my bag.    “What was it?” my dad said coming from the back room. I described to him how my wallet had been returned to me by an anonymous person who left everything that didn’t belong to them alone.    “That’ll restore your faith in people,” he laughed. It had. It had not only moistened, but refilled my faith in people.
20090220205512AA081He	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I wrote the first chapter of New Moon in Alice's point of view. Tell me what you think please!?	I opened the side door of my brother, Edward’s silver Volvo and sat down quickly. He hit the gas pedal and the car shot forward. We drove in silence. I knew Edward was listening to the things running through my mind at that instant, and he laughed as I had the first vision of that day. Bella, her face scrunched up, groaning as I attempted to hand her the small present, wrapped in shiny sliver paper, that I had bought for her.     “She won’t be happy,” he said, still laughing. Bella had demanded her whole family-- including her vampire family, which included Edward and I-- to not give her a single present. Of course, I wasn’t about to let her go through the day without receiving any presents.     Edward turned the car, swiftly but gently, around the corner.     “Oh, don’t ruin my mood,” I mumbled. He chuckled, and pulled into the parking lot by Forks high school.     We got out of his vehicle, gracefully, as Bella called it, and leaned against it, waiting for the birthday girl. Edward, calm and cool--unlike me, now bouncy and excited to give Bella her present-- looked around absently.     After several minutes, I watched as Bella, in her old red ‘53 Chevy truck pulled into the parking lot, killing the engine at the first empty spot she came to. She slammed the door and walked slowly to where Edward and I were waiting.     I skipped forward to meet her. “Happy birthday, Bella!”     “Shh!” she hissed. She looked around the lot. I assumed she was making sure no one had heard me. She’d always hated attention.     I ignored her, though. “Do you want to open your presents now or later?” I asked eagerly as we neared the place where Edward was waiting.     As in my vision, her face scrunched and she groaned as I held the small present out to her.     “No presents,” she mumbled, protesting.     Apparently she didn’t want to celebrate this event in public. Knowing Bella, she probably didn’t want to celebrate it at all.     “Okay…later, then,” I told her, still by her side. Then I remembered the visions I’d had of the presents her mother and father were getting her. “Did you like the scrapbook sent you? And the camera from Charlie?”    She looked at me. “Yeah, they’re great,” Bella said, unenthusiastically.     We had reached Edward by then. He held out his hand for Bella and she took it. Her mood seemed to brighten just a bit.     Edward looked directly into Bella’s eyes as he talked to her. “So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?”     She looked back into his eyes. “Yes. That is correct.”     “Just checking,” he murmured as he ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. “You MIGHT have changed your mind. Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.”     He smiled and I laughed. “Of course you’ll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What’s the worst that could happen?”    Bella sighed. “Getting older.”     I glanced at Edward as his smile tightened into a hard line.     “Eighteen isn’t very old,” I explained. “Don’t women usually wait till they’re twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?” I knew why she didn’t want to be older. That reason had a lot to do with the fact that my brother--not biological, but ‘sort of’ brother-- would forever be seventeen years old. I tried to keep her away from that subjects. I knew Edward was thinking the same thing I was as he glanced at me.     “It’s older than Edward,” Bella said. So much for trying to keep her from saying that. It only made Edward’s mood worse.     He sighed, at Bella’s remark, and also my thoughts.     “Technically,” I said. “Just by one little year, though.” It wasn’t much at all, and she still chose to make such a big deal out of it.     I decided to change the subject as I watched Edward frown down at his girlfriend. “What time will you be at the house?”     Bella continued to frown. “I didn’t know I had plans to be there,” she mumbled.     “Oh, be fair, Bella!” I complained. “You aren’t going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?” She couldn’t do that! The last real birthday any of us had was Emmett, my other ‘sort of’ brother, and that was all the way back in 1935! I hoped she’d cut us just a little slack. We were all so excited.     Bella spoke once more. “I thought my birthday was about what I want.”     Edward turned to me. “I’ll get her from Charlie’s right after school,” he promised me, as he ignored the birthday girl’s last remark.     “I have to work,” she protested.     I turned to her, and smiled smugly. “You don’t, actually. I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She trading your shifts. She said to tell you ‘Happy birthday.’”    She looked at me, again. “I--I still can’t come over.“ She was nervous, causing her to stammer over her words. I could tell she was trying her best to come up with an excuse. “I, well, I haven’t watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.”     I snorted and rolled my eyes at her lame excuse. “You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.”     She tried again.

I answer a few history questions, and have been noticing a pattern in the questions being asked,.  Assumed it is for people's homework, but seems to many to just be one school or ever one state's homework.  So was wondering if the whole nation studies the same topics in History?      At the moment it seems it be the Treaty of Paris, the History of Palestine, World War I for a few.

Raising an eyebrow, he bowed.    “I hope I find you in good health and spirit.” He said. She raised her chin, and examined his tanned skin. He looked exactly the same. Still confidant. Still strong.   Still dazzling.    “To you, as well.” Came her reply. She had been trained to be polite to everyone, no matter how foul. A dragon could fly into her castle and set fire to everything in sight, and she’d still make it tea, as it is customary to do with houseguests. Delightful thoughts, weren’t they? She blinked once, then continued, for manners could only bind her so much.    “Have you come to see if I was still alive? To make sure your darling son hasn’t arrived yet?” She inquired, her blue eyes flashing coldly. He flinched, and she instantly felt sorry for her harsh words.    “No.” he said. “Actually, I have come to warn you. You don’t mind if I sit down?” he asked.     “Not at all.” Andalysia said with a small laugh.

20090220201904AAJTMJz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writers: How would you describe what an alternate universe is in your own words--in relation to your writings?	Even though my wife and I are presently homeless and the prospect of me getting back to my own books is rather 'up in the air'--for the moment--I've started on a new novel (using library resources) which involves dipping into an alternate universe that runs a little differently than the one I used *previously* in other books.      I've done this to try and keep my muse going and my mental processes from self-destructing. (You can only do so *much* with pen and paper--in light of the Computer Age.)      So my little 'problem is thus: Do I make what's happening there a little *darker*--or do I just 'alter' some things that would normally be found in the other universe and/or time line?      So far, I've written--offhand--15 pages to date, but my mind isn't static and its giving me new ideas and insights on how to make the opening chapters much better and more poignant.      I'm no greenhorn when it comes to writing, but some things about what I do often presents dilemmas that takes awhile to resolve.      This one involving that alternate universe got me thinking about which best approach I should use.      But how would *you*--the writer--take to constructing, writing, or building your own alternate reality/universe?

20090220234529AA1FwN3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I am very confused, which one should I do?	These two genres I feel comfortable in writing for my short story assignment, but we have to do one!      The reality:   This story is from a woman's point of view who had been through child labour, when she was a young village girl. She ran away from her work, and with luck and destiny, she is able to learn and educate herself. From then on, she fights those who take these innocent children away from their parents to work. (So, I basically write about what happens to her when she was a child, and how she escaped)      The fiction:    This is about a suspicious girl and her friend (the girl is 14 and the guy 15) who think life is just ordinary. They read so many fantasy books and feel it might happen to them! Yet when all hopes are lost, it does happen (but I;m not sure what happens; that is associated with these words: destiny, forest, whisper, secret letter and a knock!      It would be nice if you could help me with the plot of the fiction too!      Please help me choose.      (The reality story is the first I thought of, I usually think of fiction)

Forget the distance   Remember the passion   When we first met in Vegas   And how it all began   That one dinner out   Dumping pasta on our server   And then you started crying   He told you it was fine, he's a big forgiver   On our third date, at the movies   We held hands during the entire thing   And afterward it was a karaoke bar   You pulled me up and made me sing   I was never embarrassed to be with you, though   Even when you knocked the toupee off that guys head   I always looked forward to one thing   Staying up talking, and lying around in bed   I still remember when I first proposed   Exactly six months after we met   You turned me down that night   And told me you just weren't ready yet   I told you I would wait as long as it took   You thanked me seemed truly happy   But then after about a month   It was you who proposed to me   We were married in the church in your hometown   We invited everyone we knew   From our parents, grandparents and siblings   To co-workers and a stranger or two.

I don't even think Blaise is a girls name...though many people tell me it is lol.      I know that he is barely in HP  (WHICH SUCKS I LOVE HIS CHARACTER) but I am sure that she at least wrote that he has a penis lol.      So can someone explain that to me?       Also heck, does anyone else like his character as much as I do? I wish he was in the movies.       When I write stories I always write him as a main, I also always read him as a main lol            If you hate Harry Potter I can careless, ignore my question. I hate getting answers with non fans bitching and moaning and being plain rude. Makes me want to punch someone.

Ex: This line is oddly, very long that   ----indent---- it takes up two lines.         Then another line of the poem would go right under.

The edges of all my pages slowly torn away, as I close my eyes I see all of your ashes blown away. In this afterlife deep in the abyss of black and white I fight to remember the difference between wrong and right. Memory fading...secrets spilling…all of me revealing to the world. Torn away from material things all I want to see is my angel with wings. Come to take me from this place…away from this demon man with all my sins strewn across his face. I remember now, as I’m in his grip… how has my life come to this?

But they are for a Sd (or 1/3) doll, rather than an MSD (1/4), which is what I'm buying. Does it really matter? Do I need a special head for them? Or do I just get some hot glue and go crazy?      It would be lovely if you gave me some answers.

20090220231928AAs4qE0	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Stupidest question ever probably... Slightly yellow pages in a book?	Okay, so I bought this book, "Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System", and for some odd reason, the pages seem slightly yellow-orange-ish tinted. They are definitely not bright white. It might possibly be the lighting, but this drives me insane when the pages of a book are not stark-white.      It says somewhere on the pook that it is printed with "acid-free" paper. I read about it on the internet, and it says acid-free paper is supposed to keep it staying white, not yellow.      My question is: is it possible that another exact same copy of this book would have bright white pages, and could the case be made that it should be given to me for no charge, since I paid the same price for lesser quality?

20090219134026AAaEe5X	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my writing good? Please answer?	JANUARY 24th      His physical appearance dazzled me the first time I saw him. He walked into room 133 on that first day of school, his brown, messy hair and casual-dressed look. As I watched him, his deep brown eyes searched the room, looking for something. His sharp jaw-line moved as he talked to the boy next to him. Although I sat far away, too far away, I could slightly hear his low voice cut through all the other voices around me. I wished to talk to him, but I could tell just by looking at his handsome face, that there was no chance. Yet with that knowledge in my head, I couldn't give it up. Each minute that passed, my head was filled with images of him. His beautiful, perfect face and his voice. That irresistable voice that, to me, was more of a whisper, somehow came out clear in my head, repeating over and over. I saw him as I knew would never be. He would look into my eyes, smile his sweet, gentle smile, embraced me, his warm self surrounding me. Then he would whisper, so softly it was almost not there, 'You are beautiful'. But I would snap out of it, my amazing trance would end. Reality and fantasy were always far apart. At least for me it was, and as it looks, always will be.

20090219115828AAYUubV	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How can I cure myself of cynicism or be less cynical?	A friend states that i'm too cynical for my own good. I to some extent agree. I do think the worse of people at times, I don't have any abandonment issues in the past or any triggers like that, I just know when someone is being fake and two faced and won't pretend like its acceptable.       My friend and I were walking to our flat after a tiring session at our university gym and engaged in a few conversations. One including pick up lines and how only some people may find them amusing, as well as if its okay to buy a girl a drink on the first date especially when you don't know her.       I will state for the record that I find buying a female stranger a drink to be something that makes you look too easy. I prefer to get to know people by talking, joking, and if I really fancy a girl, approach her in a romantic manner, not over doing it but, I dont believe in pick up lines and all that rubbish.       My friend uses them to break the ice and make a girl laugh, fair enough, but they are over used nowadays in society, so I find them cringy. He also asked me "So if a beautiful woman walked up to you and said, hey can I buy you a drink? You wouldn't see it as a nice gesture and rather look at it as a she is up to something?" To which I replied yes and stated never trust a beautiful woman especially one that's interested in you and that the probability of that happening is too hilarious for comfort, adding that his statement was a bit random and beautiful girls don't buy drinks, they have drinks bought for them and if you don't buy them a drink or accommodate to their needs, they leave.      Even I agree that I can be too much at times and I don't want to live a life where i'm a bit too cautious and think badly of people. I do have good times and I've been told that I make up for being cynical by sarcasm, charm and arrogance but still, I want to be able to relax once in a while... Any suggestions?

20090219140825AAf5pUu	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	1   I wave my hand and signal her to come over, and end up swatting a fly swarming my head in the process.  She flashes her perfectly straight teeth.  Her long black hair is tangled in some areas, she probably didn’t bother brush it that morning, but its simplistic wave and side bang tucked behind her petite ear make her look as good as usual.      “Hey!” she said once I was in hearing range.        “Hey, Ris.”        She wiped her hands on the back of her legs, and plopped down next to me on the cool grass.  I’m sure the grass, swaying in the faint wind, was tickeling her pale skin, as it was mine.      Iris’s long legs were tucked under her chin, and her arms were wrapped around them.  With the sun catching her emerald eyes, she asked, “What are you up to May?”      “Nothing, just…nothing.”      Iris sighed and released her grip on her legs.  She leaned back on her elbows, then immediatley picked one hand up to sheild her eyes from the blinding sun.  We sat there for a minute, and listened to birds chirp, as I tugged some grass out of its roots.        After another sigh, Iris asked with an optimistic tone in her voice, the kind she uses when shes bored, “Wanna race to the pond?”       “Sure.” I reply, wiping down my pants as I stand.  I know she’ll win, but I didn’t really care.  Iris likes to race when we do “Loser has to…” and it seems like everytime she wants to win something she offers a race.  I mean, the girl makes sense.  She’s one of the fastest runners I’ve ever met, and I’m one of the slowest.      She leaps up, her yellow tank top flaring at the bottom.  “I don’t know about you, but I’m hot enough to jump in when we get there…”       “Come on Ris, I’ve got a good tank top on.”  I looked into my friends diappointed eyes, “Ugh, fine.  How about this?  If I win, I’m not coming in with you.  But if you win…”      “You have to jump in with me!”      “Yeah,” I assure reluctantly.      *****      The pond was close to a mile away, and everytime I ran there I was out of breath and sweating.  I hated jumping in there though, cause who knows whats lives in that thing?  It’s all murky and salty and gross to me, but Iris loves it.  I guess in some places it would be considered a lake rather than a pond, it’s big enough to be one.  But here, we called it a pond.  See, it’s surrounded by sharp rocks, that rise high above the pond.  Being the daredevil she is, Iris loves jumping off them, (not that her mother loves her doing that) and of course, she has to get me to jump off them too.     “Alright, you ready, May?”  Iris asks, leaning against the Old Oak tree we always meet at.  It’s big and tall and rough, and has a lot of things carved into it from people who hung out there before us, like “JI + SA = BFFL”, but as far as Ris and I know, were the  only ones who hang out there now.  We never bring anyone else there, even though its kind of a public thing that everyone knows about.  Everytime we meet there, its just me her, and usually some snacks or little bring-alongs.  Sometimes we even do our homework there together, that is, when it’s nice enough out to.      “Yeah, sure.” I answer her, and as soon as she hears those words, she shifts all her weight to her left leg, her right leg bent close enough to the ground for her to be on it.        She grinned at me, as I heard her yell, “Ready…Set…”, for what felt like the thousandth time, “GO!”      With that she dashes off, leaving the Old Oak in the dust.  Of course I ran as fast as I could to catch up to her, but I didn’t even compare to her.  I noticed she’d kicked off her yellow and white striped flip flops, and left them behind.  In an attempt to do the same, I trip to the ground and into the tall grass, which probably hadn’t had a good mowing in at least a year.  I sighed and jumped back up, the grass once again tickeling my now bare feet.  I hurried over the remaining patches of grass, bolted as fast as I could around small boulders that Iris and I sometimes climbed up on and looked out over the town, and then finally across the home-stretch of closely mowed fields of yellow grass.        My sight of the pond was growing better, my sight of Iris worse.  What I could see, though, was her wavy black her bouncing up and down, up and down, as if she were jumping on a trampoline.   My feet pounded hard on the ground.  I could feel dirt seep through my toes.  It had a faint coldness to it, and made me feel like I had worms crawling all over my feet.      Before I know it, Iris is dripping with water, in the pond waist deep, and smirking at me, her eyes gleaming.  Water has splashed up and hit me, panting and leaning on my knees.

Hi everyone, I'm a budding artist and I use The GIMP because I can't afford photoshop :(      When I save my work, its fine, but it doesn't save unless I 'flatten' the image. When I re-open my art to resume work on, I find that the layers have been merged and I don't know how to separate them again, so I cant complete that piece.      If you're confused, then here is a diagram-type-thing that might help:      layer 1(lineart) and layer 2(colour) are separate.      then I save my work.      When I open it again, layers have been put together into one layer and I cant work on the picture because it destroys the previous work.             Help please!

By this, I mean are there any books which combine the same themes of the book, like the use of elements and vampires and religion, with the whole super powerful (not so much super, but still powerful) main characters.         I've read Twilight, but I found Bella lacking character... Not that I don't mind the books, it's just I want a book with more depth.        I also started reading the Vampire Academy books, but I didn't really enjoy it.        I guess I just want to know if anybody knows of any books with people with awesome powers, a decent plot, thrilling...

20090219165634AA7UQZe	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Guidance counselor is brutal towards me when I needed help?	Okay, I don't know what to do. There's a teacher who's harassing me, Short version of story :      Teacher made us (every student) grade eachothers people and I graded a guy's paper who was almost completely flawless and she called me a liar and lazy for not "properly" grading it. I didn't do anything wrong anyway. I did as what she said and she said I was lazy for that..... I find it really offensive and inappropriate for a teacher to call a student 'lazy' and a 'liar' and she's the one who's lazy. She's the teacher, she should be grading the papers, not us.      So anyways, today, I went to the counselor for some help and my counselor started to be completely brutal to me and say things like I change the story.... I don't know where she got that from. First, I told her the story and she kept interrupting me so obviously, she WOULD have problems understanding it when she didn't even let me finish. Then, she wants ME to TALK to the TEACHER.... Why on earth would I talk to a teacher who calls me a liar and lazy when that teacher herself falsely accuses me of things and refuses to listen when I defend myself. This counselor isn't even a counselor to start with. She was a kindergarten teacher for 9 years and this school hires her....      Anyways, please help. Idk what to do now. It seems like this no-brained counselor doesn't want to help and only want to criticize me and support the teacher because she USED to be a teacher..... Also, don't mention my parents because they abuse me and this is why I'm really sensitive not only to myself but to everyone around me.      I'm getting once-a-week counseling because of things with my parents and such so you don't have to worry and thanks for your concern.
