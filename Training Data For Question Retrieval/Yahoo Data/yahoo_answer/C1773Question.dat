This is    a very exciting new program that I will explain using the Q and A format:      Q. What is an Economic Stimulus Payment?   A. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.      Q. Where will the government get this money?   A. From taxpayers.      Q. So the government is giving me back my own money?   A. Only a smidgen.      Q.  What is the purpose of this payment?   A. The plan is that you will use the money to purchase a high-definition    TV set, thus stimulating the economy..      Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?   A. Shut up..         Below is some  helpful advice on how to best help the US economy by    spending your stimulus check wisely:        If you spend that money at Wal-Mart, all the money will go to  China.   If you spend it on gasoline it will go to the Arabs.   If you purchase a = computer it will go to India.     If you purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras, and    Guatemala (unless = you buy organic).   If you buy a car it will go to Japan.   If you purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan.      And none  of it will help the American economy.        We need to keep that money here in America. Y ou can keep the money  in    America by spending it at yard sales, going to a baseball game, or spend    it on prostitutes, beer and wine (domestic ONLY), or tattoos, since    those are the only businesses still in the US.
