l9havFTaaa	I think u should return it
shSu8HDQaa	i think you should try his website or something ive been looking cince thursday on the winter jam.|`|IPATFSAcaa	What does that look like?|`|YhW59offaa	I tried googling that, but apparently, no one is allowed to look as awesome as Tobymac. haha. Tobymac ftw.
TKHA5okpaa	I also have very pale skin and I dye my hair all the time from brown , brown w/highlights then back to blonde. My natural color is ash blonde.  I've found whenever I go brown it HAS to be a warm color. For warm look for a color that has "golden" in the name, Medium golden brown or Light golden brown is best. If your hair is medium blonde you should go with Light Golden Brown first, so you have a chance to get used to it. Do not go for Dark Golden Brown if your concerned about looking washed out...over the years I've used all three trust me even though you'd think there isnt much of a difference between Dark,Medium brown and Light brown there really is. Dark and Medium brown is really dark I know what it looks like on the box but on real hair it translates to almost black, and I prefer my brown to look truly brunnette like a chocolate bar.   Also if your pale when you go brown your going to have to wear blush, I NEVER wore blush before, but after I colored my hair brown I hated looking like I had a big white face, then I saw a pic of Liv Tyler (beautiful brunnette right?) and I noticed she was wearing this pinkish blush so I started wearing blush and it makes all the difference in the world when your hair is brown!  When I go back to blonde all I usually need is more eye makeup.   If your worried about looking washed out I definetly recommend "light golden brown"  Again, forget about what the lady looks like on the box, I've read that whenever buying store bought hair color you should always select a color that is 2 shades lighter than what you are trying to achieve....I also went to beauty school and even though it didnt end up as my career of choice I cant tell you how many young girls would come in and leave crying because their hair was just too dark, because they were relying on the hair swatches.  Anyway, to answer your q. in a nutshell,  go for light golden brown, and get some blush too!|`|DzLX1ophaa	Go for the warm tones, if you are looking for a specific suggestion try a golden dark brown, good luck!|`|Skwo27RYaa	It depends on your skin tone. I would suggest going with your natural coloring. If your hair is naturally ash brown, I suggest leaning towards warm shades of dark brown. That would allow your hair to bring out your skin tone, assuming its cool (cool=pinkish for skin tone)). If your natural skin is warm (yellowish for skin), I would go with a cool or neutral tone. If your skin is neutral (white base), you can really go with either, but definitely don't go with neutral hair! Also, if you are really pale, make sure not to go too dark - the tone can really make or break your look, and if its too dark, no color shows through!    I don't know if your hair is curly or straight, but either way, if your getting dark hair don't get too thick of a hair cut - too much dark hair can make you pale regardless.
IwaaSQZcaa	You're Fine...    I think too much makeup is when you can tell that the girl cares more about her looks than school ex. totally obvious cover up, obnoxious glittered up eyes, etc...|`|uOtZUzNOaa	it sounds like you look fine.  your eyelashes can NEVER be too big or long.   (:|`|K4VX1u9zaa	i wear foundation,mascara,blush,and pinkish magentaish lipgloss,no eyeshaow except on the brow bone to highlight and i get told that i look like a clown,which i thinking is freakin retarded.  so to people the least makeup would be only marcara and eyeliner but not liquid eyeliner.|`|10EXUriqaa	http://stylefrizz.com/img/christian-dior...    thats too much ^    i dont really wear girly makeup.....i wear either black or red eyeshadow, and black eyeliner...some powder foundation sometimes|`|x9nEFd0maa	if you hug someone and leave a face imprint on there shirt, your wearing to much make-up!    [x|`|Oii9H4g6aa	i go to school with black eyeliner, cream white eyeshadow and a little bit black eyeshadow witha  lot of lipgloss and then pressed powder and black mascara. occasionally the teachers can catch you but be careful, you dont want to get a demerit :)|`|jcGnBgAPaa	i love fake eyelashes. its just school.... but if looking good makes you feel good, handle it. as long as your not going heavy on the eye shadow, its good. heavy eye shadow is more of a night time going out thing you know? not a go to school thing.|`|9WKDuREDaa	LOTS of eyeliner and dark eyeshadow, it looks extreme there! I know a girl and she uses mascara, blush, LOTS of eyshadow, eyeliner, and so much cover up that you could staple her face and it wouldn't hurt her, if you wear alot of cover up it will look kinda like a mask over your face (i know another girl and she looks like that)|`|kiJVFGrlaa	i think too much makeup is when you start too look like a raccoon with the eyeliner|`|QWevnlTUaa	i think you are fine.  when you look like a clown then thats when its too much|`|LZWZXPOeaa	when people notice your makeup more than your face, it's too much.    And it's not too soon to learn that there is a difference between day makeup and night makeup.  It's something every grown woman knows.  Because, above all things, you never want to look silly.  That being said, I think that blush and some respectable eyelashes are fine for school.|`|hgIiF3sdaa	Too Much Make Up is when a girl has an orange face from all the foundation,    and overly back eyes >.    you're fine :)    i only wear, a small amount of foundation, and mascara,|`|kW371HVMaa	fake lashes?? for school???|`|bHMPolh1aa	well, I wear thick black eyeliner around my eyes and i don't think it looks bad. just as long as you don't use too much blush (that makes it obvious yer wearing blush) or make your eyelashes overdramatic. You should be fine, otherwise.

sbiCl376aa	i think 13 year olds shouldn't wear that much makeup.. you look better without it..i mean no offense or anything but instead of looking cute ..girls that young look trashy...just curl your eyelashes and wear a clear mascara and some lipgloss..yur super cute w/o it :)|`|kW371HVMaa	i like you a alot better with the makeup on!|`|nbWO3IANaa	1] not ugly - far from it  2] too much liner - use a THIN line, along LASHLINE only - too much closes eye up  3] I love the lip gloss on you!|`|0AQF8pnKaa	you look prettier w/ make-up, however, lay off the lipstick :)|`|uOtZUzNOaa	curl you eyelashes..if you don't already.  and get a lipgloss. you're too young for lipstick, it makes you look made up.  you're pretty though.|`|4jEfmL56aa	I think you're pretty both ways. Actually, once you get older, (you're about my age) you get lotsa zits and ugly things. Makeup just makes that worse. I don't wear ANY make up and I'm pretty :)    Dude, you're so pretty.  Be happy with the way you look. Some people have to wear loads of makeup because they wrecked themselves when they were younger by wearing makeup.   Sure you can wear it once in a while, but come on. I'm almost 14 and I don't wear eyeliner, mascara, or blush. The only thing I wear all the time is lip gloss.    Remember. You're pretty with your natural beauty. That's what guys are looking for. You'll intimidate other girls with your natural beauty. :)|`|brmStGOuaa	You are really pretty and your skin is flawless. All you need is mascara and eyeliner|`|andgb1hDaa	you look pretty both ways.  try using less eyeliner though =)|`|CeqbfVscaa	get some bronzer,foundation cream,and eye shadow|`|H331wkQdaa	i think u look pritty eather way an when i dont were make up im the same age  my eyes look really weird an my lips look really chapt but ur fine|`|kiJVFGrlaa	nothing your sooooo pretty  im jealous|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	You're very pretty!  I dont think you need makeup but if you want to do it    Go with mascara...a bronzer..and a lipgloss...    you have natural beauty..so less is definately more on you!!|`|vcNOuvPNaa	You are gorgeous and for all those saying to ease up on the lipstick what colour are you seeing? Because i do believe that is a nude shade and is perfect for her skin tone AND age!!! so good job on that,    I don't know if its the shadow in the pic but it looks like your doing a smokey eye look or a thick eyeliner on your eyes. If im right , that's great look for night time, but as for day i would only use the eyeliner on the top lid, curl the lashes add some black mascara and maybe apply some dark or medium coloured eyeshadow with a thin brush to the bottom as a more natural eyeliner.    As for you without makeup... you are a natural beauty! Only use makeup for accentuating your best features for example your beautiful  eyes.    Quote: don't tell me im ugly. I already know thanks    Are you serious!? Look in the mirror again and have a reality check you.are.gorgeous. and you STILL havent fully matured.|`|mFhMX9qRaa	mmkay well i think that your makeup is a little heavy for your age. but i have suggestions that will make you look amazing!  (and your definitely not ugly your beautiful hun)  start off with a face moisturizer on a clean face.  apply a little bit of pressed powder on your face that matches your skin tone.   then, apply black eyeliner (only a little) to your top eyelid only.  curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler and apply some mascara (only a little dont clump it on) and apply mascara to your bottom eyelashes (again, only a little)  top it off with either a clear lipgloss or a babypink tinted lip gloss.    try it! it would look so good on you i promise, and its suitable for school too! :)|`|mji7KtSEaa	Your pretty either way. Just ease up on the make-up a little.|`|imjKIG9Iaa	you are a pretty girl, but you are only 13 you should go a little more natural. try not putting so much eyeliner on, it really looks heavy. use a thinner line but the lipgloss is a really good color on you!!|`|J5snZnd0aa	i suggest wearing natural make-up and dont go too heavy with the eye liner

IwaaSQZcaa	Well what toothpaste does is dry up the zit, just like benezoyl peroxide (regular acne treatment). Any toothpaste works the same, just make sure it's white paste and not gel. Dab a small thin layer , and wash off after about 15 minutes. It didn't work for me, but many people say it works.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	any minty it burns for like 2 seconds and just dries it right up do it when u go to bed and then it has all night to dry the oil up|`|HyDBQZhdaa	NEVER TRY THAT! It totally dries out ur skin! Just an urban myth. People do it & it will work, but if you don't  want dry skin like i said, don't do it! Get like, zit remover. Or, if you don't need relief the next day or so, try Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash. It worked 4 me!!!!|`|5e8cf46067e92dbf7676f55f93f81341aa	tht dries ur skin.... dont do it i know from experience|`|CuhJRewLaa	it doesnt    just thought id say that because i didnt want to be cursed forever|`|38r67Civaa	toothpaste?    ew:x|`|pHEIxQoBaa	colgate.  its what fergie uses.|`|l6yHfjBNaa	I tried Crest once, and it made my first burn! haha..
7RGtUnQJaa	yeah it's gross =D    I think the perfect length on girls (in my opinion) would be chest length hair and a bit longer than short nails but not too long =)|`|ppKQEhEMaa	I think its fine...each to their own.|`|n1D90COxaa	long anything is ok, as long as it is kept clean and neat.|`|lk4ulp69aa	I believe that it's not gross once you take care of it right, and don't drag it along the sidewalk all the time, you have really pretty hair, but you need to wash it, and take care of it really good in order to keep it that long and healthy, it's really pretty hair! I wish that my hair was that long, with an exception. There's a girl and her mother in Ripley's believe it or not, and her hair is about your length, but I think that you may get that all the time. you have beautiful hair, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    I'd also like to point out that people with long fingernails aren't gross they just need to tend to the nails very carefully before they start to attach to the skin and grow veins. Seriously.|`|98GbovYTaa	nNOOOOOOOOOO..really long hair can look really good..i find really long nails disgusting though  obviously not that picture..just not good|`|5wOyJ9DWaa	No , i think it;s gross also|`|lD9FP9bSaa	extremely long hair is gross!! i agree with you!     [best answer please]|`|btMmriQvaa	reallyy gross|`|06shvnI7aa	eww yeah I think it's gross too. The longest I would ever go is to my belly button IF the hair is healthy and has a good style.

4wagn8KDaa	there is a cream for removing hair paints and dies they sell it at like Sally's or got to any place where they have hair prodicts. for the skin you should maybe see the dictor and let him recommend an ointment or any kind of cream you might want to buy any cream like aveeno most of those are for irritated skin.cream won't take all the rubbing stuff off but also give it time to heal.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Only time will fix that.|`|06shvnI7aa	You should call their costumer service.

NEVER EVER EVER RUB YOUR FACE!!! It only make MORE of your skin irritated. Since hair color hair chemicals in it, only time will heal it. Have patience.
fMPuTA6Uaa	it's normal for it to do that for a while. I use the tattoo goo brand lotion for dryness but you can use lubriderm unscented... just keep it moisturized and eventually it will stop doing that. It's at the phase now where it's kind of like a sunburn thats in the peeling phase. After that finishes up it will be healed|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Keep using tattoo goo. Some tattoos peel for a while... One of mine peeled for almost a month. Not like the serious first peel, just a sort of mild shedding that happened. I think its normal for some tattoos to just do that.|`|JzgzvPxvaa	now that the scab is gone the skin undermeanth has to regernate. its normal for it to peel like a sunburn, just dont pick it.. it will probably go away in the same amount of time your scab took. dont use regular lotions, but you can keep using tattoo goo, but you dont have to.
AUQKyiefaa	You should get the first one.|`|4f06382102ace92d536a786ce63c7a5caa	Probably if you can only get one i would get the first because you can wear it with more stuff|`|JXrvbW7caa	I love the first one|`|wGrRvFePaa	I LOVE the first one. It's very in-style, and it'll last. The second is a little loud, you won't be able to wear it with a whole ton of stuff.

Especially at that price!|`|YmDkqJz4aa	im telling you right now..when youre 16, you wont want to use a bag like that.    but if you MUST get one, the first def.|`|Fb5SRq25aa	I |`|yuDnMYkjaa	Both of them are supper cute, But i would get the first one i would so wear that. the second one wouldnt go with alot of outfits.|`|oKZ3GstXaa	ouhh i like the 1st one, i never really liked coach but i really like that one, id totally get it.|`|tUW3tR2vaa	they are both cute  but if you had to choose one  you should go with the first one|`|GmPIU2MNaa	I really did like the first one... The last one looks like a purse a much younger girl would wear...    BUT... i do really think you should buy a purse in black leather... You can use it to everything, and when you get older, you would still love it ^^, a black purse never get old an unmodern!.... It's elegant...|`|DDhEtH8Kaa	I totally love them both but the first one you can wear more and with different outfits so the first one!!    Personally I have like 4 bags and they are in mint condition!!|`|CJ43KbjEaa	there both supercute but i like the first one the best
Sq5m5wbOaa	get a hair cut that makes a bit of your hair go on the sides of your face and maybe bangs would also help|`|mQHsFx62aa	i would be happy to have a baby face|`|2jNQhT7laa	Uh, you'll be glad later, like in 20 years, that you have a baby face.

I also tried Luminous by Revlon from Target and that works okay. If you don't have eyelash curlers you could try buying some of those too from Walmart for like four bucks.|`|uGbiszrkaa	ive tried a ton and they all smear even waterproof ones   except mac   that works pretty good|`|xAdOhtaoaa	try covergirl lash blast. it is one of the best selling mascara in history (saw on commerical). if a million women has it, it must be a great mascara right. get lash blast.|`|8FBBRRucaa	I have THE perfect one for you. like you, i've literally tried every brand of mascara there is and have never found one that really worked the way i wanted it to until recently. when searching for a new mascara i went onto drugstore.com and saw tons of rave reviews for a mascara that i had never even heard about: L'oreal lash architect 3-D dramatic mascara. its the best i've ever used, especially when it comes to their waterproof type (i always use waterproof). also, before you apply it, get an eyelash curler and hold it for a few seconds. the best one to get without breaking the bank is a tweezerman eyelash curler. both of them can be found in almost any drugstore, i've always been able to find them at walgreens. good luck!|`|bffcjpmEaa	CoverGirl Lash Blast is the best mascara i have ever used! It is so great. It defines each and every lash and makes them at least twice as long. They also look more voluminous.   To get that curled look, you can curl your lashes with a curler before you apply, and your eyes will look amazing!  The mascara is about $10, but they always have "Buy one, get one free" offers at Rite Aid and Longs.    Hope this helps!

NWa45ZDIaa	Blue eyes look great with brown & bronze eye make-up. Black or Black/brown mascara too. Deep blue colors on clothes, black always looks good on blondes. Tans help too, but since they're dangerous stick with the bottle tans.    Don't overdo make-up or accessories either, that will detract from your eyes.|`|8eeKI0h0aa	Watching a calf being born on a crisp morning when all goes well.|`|K1ZpPEp6aa	eyeliner and maybe some red lips|`|mrdnsZH7aa	A bright blue top and a pair of black or khaki bottoms. If you have longer-than-shoulder-length hair then you should leave it down and pull it in front of your shoulders. If it's shorter, wear it up in a messy bun. That's what i would do.
5oAU7S9zaa	I use to  be a tomboy to then I hit about eight grade, and I just wanted to wear make up and buy different clothes. My parents were totally supportive and I didn't wear too much at first so it wasn't a big deal at school. Don't worry about what your family thinks, I'm sure they'll be happy with whatever you decide to do, and about the school thing. Everyone comes around eventually, there aren't that many women that I know that don't wear makeup. Everyone has to start at some time.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	If you're a tomboy you really don't want to loose that, so don't do anything too "girly".

Because with mine nad everyone else's i think you're good to go!|`|ZWKnjkBtaa	I think you should be who you are...  because the people who loves you will acept you the way you are no matter what!!!  and if one day you want to wear make up do it because you want to, not to for other ppl to like you!!!|`|x7qKihhPaa	If you really want to stay a tomboy then stay one. You shouldnt change yourself for other people. look how you want and only how you want. i highly doubt that your mum and friends will act different around you. just act the same if you are worried about that.      hope this helped!|`|Br3k7Hagaa	I used to be a tomboy and I sorta still am, just curl your lashes a little bit and use a bit of mascara. Use foundation and cover up where you need it and check natural make-up videos on youtube.

Gy9kt139aa	I think yellow would be a nice color. Bold- colored bathing suits supposedly make people look tanner.|`|zTq0NSGUaa	If you want to stand out, get a bright color.

YosRUFglaa	for an easy style, try a messy bun. wash your hair the day before, leave it down, then in the morning just gather your hair into a ponytail, and wrap the pieces around. stick in more hairbands to make sure it stays. you can add some cute clips, too. this is a great style for a lazy morning.    what texture is your hair?  you could try curling or straightening it. For curling, try putting damp hair in rollers and sleeping on them so that you don't damage your hair with the heat.    if your hair doesn't stay in  regular braids, you could put them in french braids. shower in the morning and when your hair is slightly damp, braid it. then put a little hair spray, gel, or de-frizzing serum to keep the pieces in. sleep with the braids and the next morning you'll have perfect waves.     i know you said that you already do ponytails, but for a classy, slightly different take on them try this: make sure your hair is straightened and smooth. pull it back into a low ponytail, then take a small section of hair and wrap it around the hairband holding your hair. secure the piece with bobbypins. clip your bangs back with a nice clip. or, pull your hair into a loose ponytail at the nape of your neck, then create a hole just above where the hair goes into the hairband. flip the ponytail in through the hole to create a french twist ponytail.     try taking a small section of your hair and french braid it, as you may have seen lauren conrad do on the hills. (like this: http://fashionfeen.files.wordpress.com/2... and instructions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apxJqnHF0...     if you're bored you can always just buy some new clips or hairbands, those go a long way towards mixing up your hairstyles.    or you could try getting a new haircut, highlights, or hair color!      hope this helps :)|`|XN0cYCATaa	OK, I hope you are ready for this cause I have a Lot, I am Partial to the Bob Style, so I will Start with that, But not limited to that.

sHUnctqIaa	When you apply your foundation let it get on your lips in a thin even coat to pale them out. Then apply either a peach pink or pale pink matte gloss to your lips. Don't get one with a bunch of shimmer in it.     I like Bare Minerals buxom in Dolly for a pale lip look. Cover girl makes a pale pink wet slicks as well.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	Well, This is what I do:  Put a butt-load of chapstick on,   put fondation on a makeup applicator sponge, pat your lips with it,  put more chapstick on.|`|sKMA00QNaa	Buy A Nude LipGloss Color I don't agree with letting some cover up on your lips because it'll dry it up and not all lip glosses are moisturizing so what I do is apply chapstick first then a nude lip gloss :]|`|MpqIrZJNaa	I have the perfect colors for you!!!  Here's what I use for the most gorgeous nude lip.  I use ANGEL lipstick by MAC  and top that off with TURKISH DELIGHT lipgloss by NARS  (you can get it at Sephora)|`|drnWPqHcaa	I have about that same lip color/skin color and what i do is use soft lips first then put on this 24/7 lip glide gloss from Sephora. i think urban decay makes it and the color is called Video. it wourks really well for me to get really cute nude lips

I liked the first picture the best because you looked really fresh and natural in it; you could probably get a lot more modeling jobs looking like that than with a bunch of makeup on. Depending on your height, I'd say you definitely have the face to model.|`|F3PEEMK3aa	you look a little like taylor swift in some of those....yeah youre pretty. it depends on how tall you are to model.    you know youre pretty and youre just wanting people to compliment you.    edit: you definatley did NOT think you were ugly if you asked if you could model...|`|fRWWUgMoaa	if you are tall and skiiny, then yes, i do believe that you have the potential to perhaps be a runway model. you have the perfect eyes, chin and sucken cheeks, which allows you to have that fierce, exotic look.|`|DOrlUfHgaa	model wut?
NCvX4I0baa	I'm a girl and I didn't know girls could have an adams apple. I do know that you can have surgery and shave it off. Not that I'm recommending you too. A guy who's into you won't mind a tiny bump on your neck.    You're different it's cool.|`|IhtABUWMaa	Actually, everyone has an Adam's apple (technical term: prominentia laryngea). On males it is more prominent because during puberty the Adam's apple grows to accommodate the growth of the voice box and males tend to have deeper, rougher sounding voices so the voice box is larger. On rare occasions it can appear prominent on women, too. The primary purpose of the structure is to protect the delicate voice box from injuries.|`|AA11125205	everyone has an adams apple. just some are easyer to see but its only a problem when your voice sounds like a boyy
LBHJaqXoaa	I don't think I have ever seen that tattoo on anybody, and I have seen alot of tattoos.... I went and googled it and got a bunch of results. I am sure you can find a foot in there somewhere. http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...    How big do you want it? Where are you going to put it? Those are the two main factors as to how much it will cost. If you want one 2 inches by 4 inches, it's going to run you about $80 without color, $100 with color. And that's somewhere easy like on your wrist or your shoulder.

a4bcbddebbb0e34b8664aae2ea66bea5aa	try going for a lighter brown. It would compliment your eyes.  Try to base the color on your eyes in this picture.  It would warm up your facial hues.|`|IEQtnSbyaa	maybe auburn brown   im not sure|`|LLBxpMc7aa	keep it the natural color    trust me it looks sooooooooo much better natural :)|`|SiaRRMJ2aa	light brown/dark blonde|`|rjWmooaXaa	Natural.  But get it cut with bangs like these:  http://hairstyles.hairboutique.com/galle...  Or just some type of bangs.  And layers.   Not too layered though.  And use some silk-enhanced shampoo/conditioner.    I like the color.
oMbrgIBEaa	you could always put it with along with your breasts. like how some women do it with their cellphones or lipsticks.  if its that thin then it could fit . i did that with my phone for my prom last year. i didn't wanna carry my small purse around so i just put it there. you could also make an inside pocket on the dress to make it seem like you have nothing there. buy some fabric almost matching the color of the dress. then sew it like a square but only three sides and then slide the camera in it. since its thin it will be very discreet and simple.    how i could help.    email for more info
nhLakq35aa	I think that's a great idea. You should try using organic ingredients because that's a really big deal right now. Below are some links for different recipes for makeup and bath products.
599afa66597adbb8424196fd9e774e64aa	I have my foot tattooed but originally wanted it on the arch..it says "Be who you are" in script.  But my tattoo artist would not do my arch because he said it would fade to quickly..we settled on the top of my foot on a slant and I love it.  Good Luck!|`|AA11244758	Not if you do Karate. ;p|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yeah it will   change the location      my uncle is a professional inker|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Its actually a bad of a location. It is possible that it will fade faster just because of rubbing....just while it's healing try to wear flip-flops...things that wont rub on the tattoo.     I think thats a super cute tattoo.|`|b7k5yjuWaa	i guess it would work..but only if u put it in that exact location. Good Luck!!|`|W0b2oqZvaa	it might hurt but go for it it would probably look cute mah-mah|`|IuG0fgg2aa	i think it will look pretty nice!!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	It's true that it may fade quickly, but then again it may not. It may get a little bleeding of the color, then again it may not. It all depends on your body and how your foot is built. You'll never know unless you try.     You'll have a tough time finding an artist willing to tattoo you there because of all the possible negative attributes. But if your heart is set on having it there, I am sure there is an artist out there that will help you. If you think you should rethink the location, well, that's up to you. If you could deal with the negative IF they happen, then I say go for it! If you can't deal with possibility of color bleed out or fading and touch ups, then I say rethink the location.

YuPNVX9maa	Go to Sephora!!!! Their stuff is usually higher quality than drugstore stuff. Also, check the ingredients list on the boxes to make sure there aren't too many ingredients and no oil. A really good company is BeneFit, or Bare Escesntuals. Lastly, instead of liquid foundtion, which can get cakey, use pressed or loose powder.|`|fb3f968d6fe63ba466a60fa06bb4d2fbaa	check out loreal true match.      doesn't look cakey, always wash your face at night b4 you go to bed-    my face is smooth as silk!|`|IStGqIWBaa	Covergirl works good for me.|`|pGSfFI6aaa	Try Bare Escentuals. Its a little pricey, but its AWESOME. They have a great selection of products and awsome shades to adjust to your skin tone and texture. its natural so it shouldnt irritate your skin. I have boxes of their stuff and its the best products Ive ever used. Everything else made me break out too, but not this. Check out their home page, or buy one of their starter kits since your are a beginner.     Hope this helps!|`|ORupWJg3aa	i use maybelline Pure makeup its made with water so it doesnt clog pores and make u breakout. apply your liquid fondation with a damp applicator sponge it goes on more evenly and looks more natural|`|HYTPPq6Qaa	physician's formula uses natural and organic ingredients!   http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/d...|`|eF4hofsbaa	mineral makeup.|`|Gj6xaH9Saa	My guess could be that your make up is too dark for why it looks unnatural. Also do you put on face moisturizer before putting on your foundation? And are you wearing liquid/powder/creme? For less breakouts I would try Bare Essentuals. If it's not enough coverage for you..trying tanning/spray tanning or even a self tan lotion for your face. Hope this helps and good luck ;)|`|UvSnEWHjaa	I would have to say sephora. It may be expensive, but it's worth the quality.|`|J1MhXHyOaa	I had the same problem for so many years. The Loose Mineral Foundations that you brush on are surprisingly easy to apply and they look and feel wonderful! You do not look like you have 'makeup' on at all... in fact, people will probably think that you are not wearing any foundation. I absolutely love them. You can go the expensive route "Bare Minerals"brand or "Jane" cosmetics that you can find for just a few bucks at any grocery store is fantastic too!    They do not clog pores, cause brakouts, etc. and are wonderful for all skin types, especialy oily. If you have dry skin, avoid the eye area or any area where you may have lines or wrinkles. In this case apply a rich moisturizer and allow to set before you sparingly apply foundation, or use a cream foundation on these areas.   You will love the way that the Mineral Makeups feel, like you have none on! And they last a long time and are easily touch up without looking globby, etc.    I would say go into a Sephora or an Ulta or a nice department store and have them apply it for you and show you how. You are not obligated to buy it just because they applied it for you. They make an hourly wage as well. Then to save money, go to Walgreens,CVS, etc and get the Jane in the right shade for your skin tone. It costs like $4.00 and will last you for several months. Or you can get the Bare Minerals starter kit and it comes with an instruction DVD that is highly informative and has tons of makeup tips.  Good Luck!|`|MdhRRPHjaa	mineral makeup..cristian dior,olay,maybelline or benefit|`|oGIs2x2Xaa	Well to get less breakouts just put some face moisturizor, and a tip you can use is put less mascara on so it doesn't clump. Some of the mascaras say they don't clump, when they do, but it's really how you put it on. Lancome, Max, Mac, Maybell are all good makeup companies.
VARJfUAraa	im not really sure what it was but im sure ur fine|`|HTaXKeHaaa	no clue but had the same|`|zPdG0SDeaa	Maybe your lips were dehydrated and they started peeling?

It looks like as cold.  It will disperse to another part of your lips if you can't manage the things comes out.  By the way, you have squeeze the material from it, try to put on the related cream and don't hit it, otherwise it will leave a mark.|`|bEypuYJ0aa	It was probably a blackhead ( I know that sounds gross, but you can get those on your lip) or a spot of dry skin.|`|GiRm0r4saa	lol ew  but i think its a wart?   idk lol|`|8ZmjIYORaa	It was probably just a normal spot I guess.  Don't worry about it. If it's fine now, then you're okay.    But if it comes back, go see a doctor or a dentist.|`|ujT5teZgaa	Well I've seen this many times; it's nothing to worry about. It's a wart.

DsLx6Sixaa	Laser is NOT for everyone. If you have light hair and darker skin it will not work for you. Electrolysis will work for everyone. But it is painful and quite time consuming. You have to individually zap each hair root. That takes alot of time and it can be quite expensive. If you go to a spa and get electrolysis done, count on spending alot of money and going back many, many times. But eventually you will see results.    Many people say that the home electrolysis units work, but again not everyone is pleased. There are all kinds of systems with all kinds of reviews. There is no guarentee that it will work for you, but compared to the costs and the inconvenience of returning to a professional for repeated treatments, it might be worth a try.

fjTVAbdBaa	Learn to blow dry your hair like they do. That is what it is. Ask your hair dresser to teach you. Basically you section your hair, then brush and blow dry layer by layer section by section. You blow dry it from the root down as you are brushing, with the blow dryer pointing down. Oh, btw you should brush the tangles out before you do this. USe a good leave in conditioners and a shine serum. I like Catwalks camera ready and rusk smoother.|`|AORcLwTNaa	olive oil|`|OSD5by7Oaa	Buy the products that shes used on your hair|`|j0yv0T0oaa	Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner.<br>  Your hair is organic matter.  It needs to be nourished by organic matter.  Most shampoos and conditioners use petroleum based moisturizers.  The molecules of petroleum are too large to penetrate.  The large molecules also seal the hair, preventing any small amount of nutrients that might be in conditioner into the hair shaft.<br>  <a href="http://www.aubrey-organics.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=351" rel="nofollow">http://www.aubrey-organics.com/ProductIn...</a>|`|I5PdelDoaa	its nothing to do with products, trust me!!! its the quality of the blow dry. i used love that soft sleeky feeling untill my hair fell out from chemo. my hair is back very fine now and after a good blow dry its just way too soft and fine now - it looks way thicker now when i just do it myself but not as soft.|`|bDjI55FXaa	Yeah I'm no hairdresser either<br>  but when I blow my hair it just poofs out<br>  But when the hairdresser dries it, it lays flatter<br>  <br>  You need to blow dry your hair like how your hairdresser does|`|YB63U3Pgaa	exacetly like sashaio said. It's all to do with the products, when i'm drying someone's hair i always use a heat defence first and finish with a smoothing creme or a serum. Also if your blowdrying your own hair remember to keep the nozzel in a downward position this will really help. Before i became a hairdresser i always used to wonder the same thing...... it's not just about getting a good blowdry but this will help. I do my own hair just as god as what anyone could do it for me, only downside is drying my own hair takes alot longer.<br>  <br>  ok me and bandb09 have a slight difference of opinion. although i do agree what your saying i still believe products help as well. Yes he may charge ￡45 for a bottle of the stuff but you can get a cheaper one that will still do the same. Only use a small amount of shampoo and wash your hair twice, if your hair doesn't lather up on the first wash it will on the second. Then use only a small amount of conditioner like the size of a 50p coin if you have med/longish hair. Only apply this to your mid lenghts and ends and then smooth over the little you have left on your hands to the roots of your hair, over using products on your hair will make your hair lank and hard to manage. ( common misunderstanding that the more conditioner you use the better ) I use redken now which is very expensive but before i used andrew collinge and found his collection to be very good. and i think i got a pack with shampoo conditioner and a deep conditioning treatment for ￡12|`|s63bm0Guaa	it all starts at the shampoo bowl. <br>  1st get yourself a professional shampoo and conditioner. something for color treated hair.<br>  Then when you blow dry, you need to use the proper styling products. Quite often we use a shine serum of some sort...like Biosilk Silk Therapy and use it in damp hair and blow dry. Then at the end, use a tiny tiny dab of it to polish off the rest of your hair.<br>  And make sure you are doing deep conditioning treatments once a week.|`|bFgvpbrraa	try using extra virgin olive oil before you get in the shower and then rinsing it out at the end.|`|ALNKETwYaa	buy spray conditioner. u jst spray it in and leave it. it works wonders! gd luck! hope i help!

YuW4DWv2aa	neutrogena is the best drug store brand. "glow sheers" is a great light foundation. almay says that it is hypoallergenic, but seriously it gives my skin bad reactions!!!     your best bet would be to go to the clinque counter at a department store! they will set you up with your exact color and also what is best for your skin. and honestly, it is not that much more expensive ounce for ounce! check out the clinique website to give you some ideas!     i have sensitive skin and am very conscious about what i put on it!     both brands have awesome awesome eye stuff, too!    ps... bare minerals sucks. :/ it comes off on my clothes and you have to reapply it during the day. it is good for sensitive skin, though. good eyeshadows as long as you use a primer.|`|5462eQogaa	kay, so I like clinique make up!!!!!!

j7Omec08aa	i used to be like that too, just wait till she gets a little older. or if you want you can just invite her to like a sleep over and pretend you're doing facials or something and buy some facial hair bleach cream which will make all of that facial hair less noticable.<br>  <br>  i recomend cream hair bleach by sally hansen.. it really works and it costs like $4 at walmart<br>  <br>  picture:<br>  <a href="http://images.buzzillions.com/images_products/05/75/sally_hansen_cream_hair_bleach_face_1oz_reviews_94012_raw.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.buzzillions.com/images_pro...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  also another great product is Surgi invisi-beach... <br>  <br>  picture:<br>  <a href="http://www.getridofthings.com/images/hair-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.getridofthings.com/images/hai...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  beaching is a good way to make her hair less visible without hurting her or making her feel ugly.<br>  <br>  hope that helped :D|`|8v40KEd0aa	Let her mom take care of it. Really none of your business. I know your trying to help, but you would probably hurt her feelings.|`|735KiHn2aa	I am quite sure she knows about her facial hair problem and does not need someone being so insensitive towards her. Just ignore it. It could be genetic but it may be a thyroid disorder or something as well. Do not draw negative attention towards the little girl. Be mature about it and let it be. I am sure it bothers her enough as it is.|`|Bx6317YDaa	that's what happened with my 12 year old sister,,<br>  just tell her,,<br>  she understands,,<br>  :)<br>  - shirley

I would reccommend her hair milk and healthy hair butter.  You can get it at Sephora.
s63bm0Guaa	Pick yourself up some Biolage Conditioning Balm, and use it as a deep conditioner once a week, but still keep using the leave in as well. that will make a difference.|`|essd1DYWaa	You may try using BioSilk. I find that it works best if you put a dime sized amount when it is still wet. After it is dry put in a small amount mostly on the ends.|`|fjTVAbdBaa	What regular conditioner are you using? Have you done any deep conditioning treatments. I really like rusk's smoother leave in|`|AORcLwTNaa	tresemme hair conditioner is great|`|j0yv0T0oaa	Try this:<br>  <a href="http://www.aubrey-organics.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=351" rel="nofollow">http://www.aubrey-organics.com/ProductIn...</a>
0KSxAucDaa	That falls between 10 and 10.5
yqKi9l9laa	mine is exactly the same. apply mousse through your hair when its wet (comb through with fingers), then tip your head over and blow dry.     get a curling iron from a salon. they're expensive but the best. make sure theres a really high setting otherwise it won't curl and don't listen to the directions that say low setting for fine hair. it won't curl good then.    after the mousse you could put it in big curlers and leave in until cool. this will create waves.     try garnier fructis strong hold. and extra hold. or try any from a salon.     also, getting layers will make your hair appear thicker. or side bangs.     try changing up your part.    i hope any of this helps!     *my hair is thin and fine and all of this works for me!    p.s. sponge curlers after taking a shower at night and sleeping with them in looks gorgeous and they will def. stay curly because the curls are spiral and crazy! but beautiful.    GOOD LUCK  -emma|`|0YneW8ORaa	A good curling iron usually cost about $40-50 alright and then you want to use a de-frizz serum or spray and some flexible hold gel. Scrunched up curls look trashy so please don't do that.|`|hBcMiZDBaa	you must become jewish. you then obtain a jew fro. LOL|`|wYNtfiTMaa	Try using mouse and a lot of hairspray. try tressemme products. : )|`|U5bVpsDQaa	curling iron try CONAIR its the bestt  it wroks amazingg  and use a lot of mousse  or hairsparyy  u should use Dove  works great!
oVxr5B3Eaa	The first one works much faster... They both add color to your skin but the first does it in like 3 days and the second takes more like a week. <br>  Even though the second takes longer, I'd go with it. Less chance for streaking and having  big uneven blobs
AA12005102	I had same problem when I took my studs out, way back at age 13  I too have one ear lobe thicker then other...........indentation will go away with new earrings---------good idea to sleep in studs yet for awhile as long as you clean the studs and regular earrings after each wearing

JafLyLYgaa	What that basically boils down to is like getting a barcode tat. If you put lines RIGHT next to each other, and I'm talking EXTREMELY close here, then over time its possible that the ink could form a solid line.|`|H3PcFertaa	Before you get a UV tattoo, here is some information quoted from BMEzine about tattoo ink:  "It should be noted that plastic-based inks (for example, some of the more unusual inks such as glow-in-the-dark ink) can also lead to polymerization under the skin, where the particles of tattoo pigment, instead of being individually isolated by the body, join together into a solid, larger piece under the skin. This can also happen in cases where an ethyl alcohol is used as a carrier and it reacts with the plastic storage bottle. "|`|LVzi3okoaa	i would recommend kate von d but shes in la

4MNYCMW9aa	If your still a kid don't worry so much. Big boobs are really not that special and I'm sure you are still growing. But If you want a little bit more of a figure go with a water bra and get a bathing suit you can fit the inserts into just in case they want you to wear one. Also wear shirts with an empire waist instead of tight shirts so they don't look as small.|`|DixT79Ytaa	there are these things that look like chicken cutlets that you can put in your bra that will give you a push up as well as add a size or two.  They can be expensive but I know walmart sometimes has them as well for an affordable price.  They are very realistic and comfortable and you can put them in a bra without underwire if you are not a fan of the wire.

xVwCGfQ0aa	Wash clothes are intentionally made with continuous rows of "tags" that cause the friction that creates bubbles. While you are avoiding skin irritation, you are also avoiding bubbles. It also sounds like your water may be hard. Hard water can leave a mineral coating on your skin which is irritating.  I'd look for some organic baby wash clothes and organic "shampoo" to use as soap. Shampoo generally rinses better and leaves less residue. Look for Lauryl, laureth Sulfate, Paraben, Phthalate, and Urea free products. My daughter uses "alba" brand which seems sudsy.|`|oojO4WAraa	Maybe you are using too much fabric softener - it prevents sudsing.|`|wb9BBKzRaa	Maybe it's because you're using towels. The material may be too thick??? Try buying real washcloths. Or maybe its the soap you're using. Did you try another brand of bodywash?|`|0a2f24ac49d0ec61adc0d3fb166f4429aa	to much softener
YaOzRFhkaa	when I went to get my eyebrows tattooed by a beauty lady. I asked her about make-up and skin and beauty. if you have light skin then don't try to put really dark colors of any kind on your skin because it will take over your face. like don't where super dark lip gloss or super dark eyeshadow. Some people that have light skin are able to pull it off by wearing dark colors. natural colors always work for any skin color. By the way when I was in 10th grade i took off too much of my eyebrows and they never grew back so they looked really bad. So five years later I got them tattooed by a lady that only is trained in beauty tattoos like lips, eyeliner and eyebrows. Now I have really great tattooed eyebrows. i was numbed because it is different than going to a tattoo parlor. this is a tattoo on your face so they numb you cuz it would look good if they did it when you were moving in pain. I am not telling you to get a tattoo, I am just telling you my story on my beauty mistake. Also they lady that did my eyebrows says that your eyebrow will not grow back. I mean the main eyebrow, the parts that you pluck will. But if you keep pulling out the actual eyebrow hairs, then you will lose them forever. So be careful when you get to changing your eyebrows.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	Brown eyeshadow.   Brown eyeliner  Black mascara.  That will really make your eyes pop.|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	go pale ppl with blue eyes!!!! lol  ok so for your eyes use brown eyeshadow. and a little brown eyeliner. black mascara too. use some shimmery pink blush if you don't have natural rosy cheeks.

EaSEjCMZaa	It's normal for any piercing to be red, swollen and have 'white stuff' coming out. The white stuff is pus, or white blood cells, and they're just doing their job. Your body isn't used to the piercing yet and naturally it tries to fight off any foreign objects, bacteria, etc that enter or go through your body. Just clean it about 2-4 times a day, preferably with Dial soap, and these symptoms will gradually disappear.|`|tX27e0UFaa	It sounds infected. you need to be washing it twice a day with DIAL ANTIBACTERIAL soap and nothing else. That is the best to use and make sure you dont play with it too much, your hands carry lots of germs and touching it will make it worse.

It's your bodies way of trying to heal because your body considers any piercing a wound. The puss is white blood cells trying to heal. I had the same thing happen to me when i first got my belly button pierced. My best friend also did. Just remember to clean it at least twice a day. Don't touch it with dirty hands and you should be fine. It will take a lil while to heal.|`|6eO17ZJ9aa	mine did that too for a while, but now its fine its just a little red at the top but the bottom is completely healed, now thats my problem. the white stuff coming out of it is normal, its just because your body is new to the object. put contact solution on it before you go to bed and do sea salt soaks 2-3 times a day, helped me a lot.|`|0hXcyIHgaa	is it bright white hard stuff on it? then yes it is and u cant move the ring up and down and its really red then yes it is infected.... go to the doctor let the doctor see the pierce. if ur doctor says infected ur doctor will give u a cream to make the infections and other germs.... u have to put it three times a day<br>  <br>  i wish u luck :D|`|AA11838312	sounds lovely. . . but yes i think it definetely is infected coz if an earring holey is infected its a bit red and it oozes pus.

xEZclTh4aa	well a belly ring is really just a curved barbell so a fake is bit impossible  but if you want a fake ring that will look some what like its pierced   your best bet would be claire's   thats where i got my fake lip ring until i could really get it pierced|`|Sng95Wxiaa	At Hot Topic, they have seamless rings.  They are rings, but they full apart and ou can put them anywhere on your body.    You don't have to get pierced.  http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...|`|jrB6z23Yaa	Try google image search for belly button rings you would get the one you are looking for i believe.

AA10849332	secretion that is clear, white or slightly yellowed is normal. Your body will secrete lymph and dead cells as the piercing is healing. Crustiness is normal too.<br>  <br>  you need to be concerned if what you experience is green, brown, red or some other unusual color, has a foul odor or feels really hot to the touch. All of that is signs of infection.<br>  <br>  you don't want to use ANY kind of cream on your piercing. I know...you say its chapped. creams cut off oxygen to the piercing and give bacteria a place to collect. <br>  <br>  what soap are you using? if its the yellow/orange dial that most piercers will suggest, I have a suggestion for you. try a soap called Provon. It is anti microbial. Many piercing studios carry it but you can also get it at medical supply stores.<br>  <br>  really, unless you're moving the piercing to loosen a crusty, there is not any reason for you to move the ring around. All you're doing of you're trying to twist it or anything like that is tearing up the tissue inside that is trying to heal.<br>  <br>  <br>  make sure that you're ONLY using alcohol free mouthwash. and keep doing your sea salt soaks and rinses. If you aren't doing sea salt soaks, start, it will help with the chapping and make your piercing not so angry. Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt per 8 oz of water.|`|TepR1rACaa	The fluid is normal, your body is trying to heal the wound. You can put a dab of Vaseline on the chapped area. Since it is chapped you either need to not clean it as much or find a different solution to clean it with. Do not use alcohol or peroxide, these will only make it worse.|`|ApV70S1zaa	it's normal!dont worry<br>  you just gotta clean it with<br>  mouthwast that contains no alcohol<br>  if the stuff thats "leaking"smells bad<br>  theres a 85% chance that its an infecton <br>  DO NOT BUT DO NOT take the jewelery out or the<br>  infection will get TRAPPED inside your lip<br>  just leave it there and google up some<br>  after care or if u got it done professionaly go to your piercer<br>  but DO NOT take the jewelry out|`|zlXofrG4aa	That's normal as long as the puss doesn't turn a different colour.  Treat it like a scraped knee, don't clean it too much, but clean it just enough.  Your skin will heal itself in time.  The only thing I can think of for the chappedness is maybe a dab of unscented (!important) lubriderm lotion.  Don't do that too much though.|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	its normal. try not to pick it off so it can hurry up and heal. =]|`|37IfyNnkaa	it's call puss

Then get your mum to hold it upwards towards the seeing (or you can do this) but works better with someone else, make sure she cuts it in a straight line. If you want long layers, don't take much off, if you want short take a reasonable amount off. <br>  <br>  Goodd luckk THoughh!|`|YB63U3Pgaa	even if i told you step by step how to layer your hair you'd never be able to do it. I wouldn't even attempt to cut my own hair and i know what i'm doing, <br>  <br>  I know times are tight and people want to save money but if you want it to look right and not a total mess your going to have to get a professional to do it for you. Try looking for a mobile hairdresser if you want to save money there just as good as going to a salon.<br>  <br>  If it's as easy a just putting it into a ponytail holding it up and cutting then why dont all hairdressers do that insteading of spending time actually sectioning the hair and working through. Trust me if you got the same results doing it that way i would do it would save me alot of time and i'd make more money cause i'd be able to do more clients. It's just not that easy. But it's your choice at the end of the day. And if you are going to do it i'd start with just a little bit then dry it and see how it looks. If your going to take a lot off and mess it up then your'll find when you go to a hairdresser to get it fixed even more is going to have to come off.|`|H9Y0niYwaa	Do you want like scene hair?<br>  <br>  With a razor works really well.

That's not to say that many scene kids aren't happy-go-lucky, but they are often a strange combination of randomness and angst. Whatever you do, make sure it works and you don't completely overdo it.<br>  Your hair could be layered and colourful!If you decide todye your hair black, add a couple neon highlights. If your hair is naturally dark, consider dying it platinum blonde, or a funky colour like purple or pink. Bangs look good on any face, and your hair can be straight, curly, long, or short. You can never go wrong, as long as you're original!<br>  <br>  Scene girls wear bright coloured t-shirts with popular band names on them. Don't be shy to wearing animal print skinny jeans, or wearing print leggings under ripped pants. Things like Hello Kitty, Invader Zim, and Pokémon are getting a little dated, so if you choose to wear these, don't wear them often. Puffy tutus look stylish on any girl.<br>  Shoes. As a scene girl, you should wear shoes such as vans, ballet flats, Converse, or high heels. As long as it's bright and eye-catching, it will look great. For customisation, add things like neon shoelaces or get your friends to sign them. Make sure it looks personalised.|`|i9JFKN6Paa	If you don't know - don't do it! <br>  <br>  You should develop your own style - express yourself through you'r look. Wear stuff you like.

Don't wear pads for awhile either.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Tell him to be careful.|`|GSIHc6nQaa	Lol. Don't worry. That happened to me. Sometimes the skin tears.

aUUHXC5Taa	You can get a smart Red Dress. Check this link, I think you should go for something like what Hayden Panettiere (left) is wearing in the pic on the link: <br>  <a href="http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/02/knock-him-dead-with-this-valentines.html" rel="nofollow">http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/02...</a><br>  <br>  Red is itself a sexy colour, so you can pick a simple dress and yet look hot and sexy. A red dress in chiffon looks very feminine and flatters most of the body types; you could choose a satin and lycra but since it sticks to the body so buy it  only if you have a fab body .<br>  <br>  Alternatively, this season the Little Black Dress with some twists is very popular, and could be the safest and sexiest option.<br>  <br>  Its easy to carry Black.

YPWBwF60aa	Hmmm,    Good question.  It would really depend on how much activity you will be doing, how it affects your skin in the exact area of your proposed tattoo and how much you sweat.  Not only that, how long after you get the tattoo do you plan on doing all of this activity?    A tattoo usually takes a few days before the scab heals and/or falls off.  If you can avoid extreme physical activity for a week after getting your tattoo you should be okay.  But as I don't know the exact size of your tattoo, I would recommend going and speaking with a tattoo artist (which you should be doing anyway to plan and design the tattoo you want) and voice your concerns about baseball practice.  Your artist is your friend and should be able to help you resolve those issues.    Cheers and good luck!|`|E0Bxh5k1aa	first of all whats ****? it might hurt for the first few days bc you will be wearing shirt and it will be rubbing but just treat it at night and it should be ohkay in a week or so.|`|QrmCMbbdaa	it should be fine, it might be tender but just make sure you wash it when you get home.|`|L4mGoBb3aa	you might want to put something over like a soft gauze or something. ONLY for practice though. this way the fabric won't be to rough on it.|`|GiVdo5Gjaa	the only thing is that it will probably be sore. it will be a little irrated. you will be sweating, not sure if that is good for it. i dont think stretching is a problem. just keep it bandaged after you get it and remove and clean after 4 hours. then use the ointment they give you 3 or 4 times a day. i doubt it will mess up the tattoo, its permanent ink on your skin, not one of those fake ones that rub off. i had one on my hip and i would stretch the skin there when i would stand up or sit down and nothing happened just followed the tattoos place instructions on maintaining it.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Baseball practice will not be good for a new tattoo.  The skin on your back will be getting stretched constantly as you move around.     And what are you going to be wearing that had to be censored?|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You run the risk of sweating the ink out of your tattoo if you sweat too much, Plus, the friction from your shirt wouldn't be too good for your new tattoo. Your best bet is giving yourself 2 weeks of healing time after you get a tattoo before you sweat alot or let your shirt rub alot on it. Can you wait until after baseball season? Or get it before then with parental consent?

I use mabeline and its good, put some concealor over your pimples and red areas 1st, then cover your face with liquid foundation and blend, then put some powder foundation over the top of that and use a make-up brush to lighty dust off any exess. This will diffantly give you much better coverge. I also think some brown eye shadow as close to your eye colour as posible would look gorgous on you and some medium brown eye liner will really frame your eyes, and keep the black mascara. Then try some pink blush on your cheek bones and some pink lippy gloss on your lips and you should look gorgous.|`|A9EydXySaa	jajajajajajjajajajajajjaj~~~!!|`|By1DJAUOaa	no difference but don't smile like that, makes you look like yur hesitating and straining do a soft attractive smile.|`|zpovg4U7aa	there isn't much of a difference in the face except i can see that you had attempted to put on a bit of mascara. your hair looks better in the second picture so it makes you look better but face-wise, makeup-wise, there was nothing different really.|`|szh84bIDaa	I would say without because by wearing make up you are covering up your natural beauty and replacing it fake beauty.|`|TprIqGhCaa	it doesn't really look like you have any make up on.|`|YHu3jGq4aa	O_______________o|`|rKXatnq0aa	You look nice either way, but whichever you thinks feels more comfortable :)|`|BXR26DqWaa	Just put some mascara and some light colored eyeshadow on.|`|0mXQODsIaa	you look good both ways|`|0L3tqpEVaa	Both pics. look good.

YwHl37Hgaa	Squeeze the juice of two lemons into a mug of water and use this as a final rinse after washing your hair. This is a great rinse to help cut oiliness.  More remedies at   http://solutionsforoilyhair.blogspot.com...|`|CKLWiLbOaa	There are some shampoos that reduce oily hair. Try washing it more often if you don't wash it everyday already. Try not to use mooses, gels, or anything else like that.|`|BSdvz7YGaa	wash every day.  and do DEEP shampooing, and conditioning.  if you use alot of of hair products during the day. be sure to wash it out when the days done.|`|4W5B2yA6aa	You might want to change your shampoos and try a new one. If you are shampooing with a harsh shampoo and then not conditioning, it can strip your hair of a lot of the natural oils, causing your scalp to produce more. Your scalp might just be producing too much of it's own oil if you keep stripping it away.  Also, if you are a teenager, it is probably just hormonal changes causing the increase in oil production. It's usually around this time that most people have to start washing their hair daily. Using a little bit of baby powder in your hair when it's getting oily can help absorb the excess oil. (you can only do it once between washings though, or your hair will start looking powdery).|`|UQkgk7ffaa	just shampoo and conditioner as normal  in the morning    then at night (like fiveish) put baking soda in your hair  it takes out the moisture...aka oil  but make sure you comb all the baking soda out =)|`|rVXnSiEBaa	Clarifying and deep cleansing shampoo's work the best. Also, look for something that may say: "Normalizing".  Natural remedies are sprinkling a little baby powder to absorb the oil during the day, or using baking soda.  Also, wash your hair everyday!  Here is a site that may help!  http://health.learninginfo.org/hair-care...

eXMI11kkaa	you need a custom bent nose screw. what you're describing to me right now sounds like it's only bent to an "L". Go to a reputable piercing parlour and get them to custom bend you a brand new one.

hLKTxQDXaa	I think tanning is really overrated. I'm really pale, so I don't really look at skin color as a sign of beauty, I look at their facial features and personality.|`|kDnRouWVaa	no, some people look good with pale skin. tannings terrible for you, once you hit age thirty, you will be leathery and saggy and wrinkly and have skin cancer|`|H7evKKdIaa	no, tanning is sooo overrated doll!|`|TYsw7TzIaa	It seems to me that tan people are generally seen as more attractive in the US. Like, naturally tan. Not baked to a crisp. I've heard people say it's because it 'looks healthier' (when in reality, it really isn't). In most other places in the world, it's the exact opposite.  Then again, it could be because I notice more because I'm a tad self-conscious about my paleness. Haha.|`|DoN0ayEFaa	I always liked to have white skin better than a tan. I don't like to get a tan. I try to avoid the sun now. I have already gotten a slight tan in the sun. I guess a slight natural tan from the sun is harmless- but too much is not good.     I'm half filipina/half white by the way.|`|cXj0RqExaa	Like fake tanning? I am half Japanese and when I was little I was milky white but I get tan easily so if I lay out in the sun, I get a healthy glow. That kind of tan? I think when people tan in those booths, it's bad in many ways. You also end up looking like a carrot!|`|AOkucu5haa	Natural tans are pretty; fake tans aren't.    People should learn to appreciate their skin. I know so many pale girls who have gorgeous skin they ruin with fake tans!|`|KUZ2ubyGaa	spray tans or going to a salon to get a tan is stupid. a natural tan can be nice or if your naturally dark thats nice too. but being sun tan now can really effect you when your older. when my mom was young she was REALLY sun tan and now that shes older she has sooooooooo many wrinkles its crazy and shes not that old    you can stull be bautiful if your pale, like charlize theron or nicole kidman..here are pics of them    http://xbradtc.files.wordpress.com/2008/...    http://evilbeetgossip.film.com/wp-conten...|`|a0Bj6gaPaa	i believe that when your tanner you look prettier, i tan alot and when people are tan maybe they don't look as natural in the winter but they do look better.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Beauty is from the inside out.

People should learn to be comfortable in their own skin. Besides, u can get skin cancer if u tan a lot.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I don't care "to look tan or bake in the sun".  I have a fair complexion.....blond hair & blue eyes.  I avoid baking in the sun!    People spend tons and tons of $ to look "tan". Tthe tan looks unnatural and orange.    Tanning beds cause cancer it's a known fact.    I think I look perfectly fine w/o a faux tan, thank you!|`|1xKS2ak6aa	NO.    tan just makes you look a bit thinner.|`|2KMYz3Rjaa	Unfortunately, in my culture tan=pretty. I surf for a living and if you aren't tan, you aren't a true surfer chick. My friends and I compete with our complexions (i know, dumb, right?) I wish I didn't think it was that big of a deal but I can't help but think tanner is more beautiful. Luckily for me, I have a naturally dark complexion but I always lay out anyway. I wish it didn't matter but *sigh* it does...|`|7DJkwzKDaa	no.  im half pakistani & half guyanese.  & to tell you the truth south azns think lighter skin is beautiful...& darker skin is not.    I AM NOT RACIST.  im not talking about white ppl vs. black ppl.  i mean in south azns (pakis, bengalis, & indians) they prefer lighter skin.  & its just our mentality...i was born in that environment so i rly cant change it.|`|VitK0Wenaa	Tan might look nice in your teens, but when you hit 30 you will have wrinkles. Tanning damages your skin.    So maybe you don't think about it now, but someday you will look in the mirror and what looks back will depend oh how you take care of your skin now.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Nah, I don't find skin cancer particularly beautiful because my aunt died of it at 33.|`|ilTdInlFaa	oh tanning is way overrated. There is so many beautiful people that are pale.|`|6QGa33pAaa	damaged skin is definitely beautiful.|`|HgrzVACfaa	I think that you should be happy the color you are and that tanning is overrated. the reason i don't is because it highers the chance of getting skin cancer. i heard that when you get older your skin feels leatherish.|`|4kY1No78aa	I dont think it matters so much, it does make people look thinner though. The color of someones skin doesnt effect the way I think of them.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|XHRquczeaa	I don't care much about if a person is tan or not, I look more at natural beauty.|`|PbLuxnzdaa	most girls who i know who use tanning beds have gross skin, and the tan looks orangeish brown.    im light skinned, but i have some natural beige undertones so i like my color    if your going to be tanned do it natually! and safe!|`|acVPPTD2aa	Nah I find palish girls more attractive.

Absolutely NOT. Do not go on a diet, in fact I suggest you gain a few pounds. I am 4' 11 15 yrs old and 107 lb. I gained like 4 lbs since I weighed myself and I just found out a few days ago that I was 107 and I thought that was kinda fat. For a while. But now I don't care AT ALL. I really don't know why young girls think they gotta be so skinny. Boys don't prefer skeletons! And it's unhealthy. Gain a few pounds, do not DO NOT try to lose any more weight. And if you think you have a eating disorder (you throw up on purpose to get rid of food or you just don't eat) then you gotta seek medical attention and tell your parents. Don't let the media effect you.|`|jVsN7N6maa	u r normal dear child of god. according to research at the University of Florida that is right about average even underweight,.........u r a stick|`|N2Zb55qAaa	omg no im 5'3 and i weigh 130 and im not fat ur anorexic !!!!!!!!! anorexic anorexic anorexic ! god go eat like 75 giant chocolate cakes !|`|nWTgf17naa	HECK NO, you are not overweight!

bAYVSfdJaa	Get whichever one you think looks best.    Sweat just irritates it, I don't think it'll actually infect it, but it is a good idea to clean it after sweating.     Sea salt soaks & non alcoholic mouth wash are all you need to clean either piercing.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I would just clean it after your workout. Unless you live in a very hot area then it should be fine.

woxz5TrDaa	I had great straight and easily managable hair, I was in 6th grade and my mom got me a perm. It was the worst thing I ever did. My hair has never recovered. 8 years later my hair still suffers from it. I got my hair perminantly straightened to fix it, only made it really dry and that's about it. Use leave in conditioners, Once a week use Henna and Plecenta, (sounds groose, but does miracles) and straighten it. Don't use a hair dryer, it's horrible for frizzy and poofy hair. Don't use a brush, use a wide toothed comb.  Try extinsions, but try to work with your hair as well.|`|UQkgk7ffaa	use john frieda frizz-ease products  the dream curls gives you curly hair without  the crunch of gel...works great =)|`|9Ku17Fxwaa	get it permanently straightened.. that would be your best bet,

XmvVy5TVaa	I am not sure why considering that almost everyone will tell you that exfoliation is a key part of any skin care regimine.    I use the Clinque 3-step and I love the Clarifying Lotion (toner type 2nd step, but really is an exfoliator).  For daily exfoliation without scrub, I think it would be alright if you use the Clarifying Lotion with any cleanser.  I use it after my philosophy cleanser in the morning, and I haven't had a problem thus far.   Good question..  everyone should have an exfoliator.  But Clinique makes it part of the 3-step.

2Yijblbaaa	this is what i do:    when i tuck my jeans in they get all bunchy and my uggs look lumpy. anyway--     i cuff the bottom of my jeans about 3-3 1/2 inches ( i have tall uggs) they tuck in SO much easier and look GREAT! i do it will all my boots.    just make sure you dont cuff higher than the boot!!!|`|y1gsXEwOaa	u havta wear skiny jeans haha.   yup glad could help :]]|`|vkhQz16Laa	You'll want to get skinny jeans. Skinny jeans will stay tucked in your boots and look good. If you wear regular jeans it will look bad. There's nothing wrong with the uggs it's just probably the jeans.    Hope i helped!  ;D|`|TVm0xcuIaa	you should wear skinnier jeans and it will look nicer|`|3yacqUltaa	Use skinny jeans, and just slip your boots on over top of your jeans.|`|fIK9LBEuaa	Yeah, skinny jeans.

This really helps and saves time because all you have to do is slip them on. You can get nice ones at Hollister, Abercrombie, and Pasific Sunwear. If you don't want to go out and spend the money here are some tricks. You can wear long socks and tuck your jeans into your socks. This works really well. Another trick would be that when you are putting your boots on, twist the bottom of your jeans around so they get tight. You can also just hold the bottom of you jeans and put your hands in the uggs when you put your feet in, then carefully slip your hands out.    I hope this helps! :D
UiQ6V377aa	There are a few ways...none are pleasant...    1)Soak your whole hand in nail polish remover or Acetone. Both are bad for your natural nails though.  2)Pop them off!

(not too hot & hot enough not to burn you!!!)    well soak all fingers for about 10 minutes (the longer they are in the better results you will have)    Start on one side of the fake nail, slowly peeling up ward while moving backwards.     HINT: IF YOU CAN GET THE BACK PART OF THE NAIL TO COME UP, IT WILL SAVE ALOT OF PAIN BY NOT PULLING UPWARDS IN THE FRONT OF THE NAIL.

Then use nail clippers to remove them.|`|jUzcucmQaa	take them off|`|PyC1MIkXaa	You can soak them in acetone for about 5 minutes.|`|AA10531094	Place your nails in a bowl of acetone. Fill up a non-metal bowl with pure acetone, and begin soaking your fingernails in the solution. It will take quite a while, so get comfortable. Eventually the acetone will begin to dissolve the nail itself and soften up the glue underneath.  Step3  Remove any residual press-on nail. Using your cuticle stick, scrape off any additional glue that may still be present after the soaking process. You might find that a few extra minutes of soaking will take off any trace amounts of glue still left on your nails.  Step4  Take care of your natural nails. One you've safely removed your press-on nails, you need to pay special attention to the nail bed underneath. Buff out any imperfections caused by the glue and moisturize your nails with a heavy hand cream.|`|zKGQL8Ekaa	You can soak your fingers in nail polish remover that contains acetone---not the non-acetone nail polish remover.

AA12075083	I have been using Skin ID for a while now and I really like it. It is a series of products, personalized just for you. You take a survey about your acne (about 10 ?'s), and then they recommend three products for you.    http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski...    When you first start using it only use once a day as directed (otherwise you may get dry areas on your skin), then after you have used it for a week or two, switch to twice a day.     skin id coupon codes- http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski...|`|HfamMJIqaa	no, proactive sucked for me    idk what im using but that gives me dry skin and its worse than acne trust me so i say try the clearasil ultra|`|U9EwARTKaa	sorry cakez but i tried everything and nothing worked  i went to a dermatoligist and they put me on accutane. people talk a lot of **** about it but it is the one product that will actually make your acne disapear. i guess try pro active, i hear that works|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	Hi    First, get a.....  -toner   -acne face scrub  -acne spot treatment  -washcloth   -an acne mask  -get it all in neautrogena    Step one  Take a washcloth and pour warm to hot water on it and put the washcloth on your face and leave it there for five minutes. You dothis because the warm water opens up the pores so the medication can get deep into your pores. Once you've left it on for five minutes, pat your face dry.    Step two  Wet your face with warm water to keep the pores open and massage an acne scrub all over your face. Now rinse. There are little micro beads in the scrub that remove dead skin and the pimples      Step 3  Use a toner and pour it on a cotton ball and rub it on your face. Let it dry. The toner has a salicylic acid that clears pimples and gets the wrinkles off.    Step four   Get an oil free lotion and rub it on your face. Let the lotion dry. The salicilyc acid that you just applied can dry out your face and you need to keepbyoir face hydrated. So use an oil free moisturizer to keep it healthy.    Step 5  Use an acne spot treatment to clear up your worst pimples. Beleive me the medication it uses really works.    -use a hydrating acne mask once or twice a week leave it on your face for ten minutes after applying.  -change your pillowcase every week. Oils from your hair and skin deep into your pillowcase while you sleep. Search for a pillow case that is 100% cotton. Cotton doesn't irritate your skin and was it every week.  -put your hair up every night because the products you put in your hair can clog your pores every night and make your acne worse.  -get plenty of sleep  -take lots of vitamins and minerals  -eat healthy  -exersize  -stop popping pimples. This can leave scars and even make acne worse.   -drink lots and lots of water    How pimples form  All the pores on your skin are actually teeny tiny hair follocules which produce oil to keep your skin naturally moisturized. But it can produce too much clogging your pores.    if none of this works see a derm.     :)|`|yW6KCd7iaa	try MURAD!! it worked wonders for me!! go to www.murad.com   they have tons of products for things other than acne as well and they also have products for body/back acne!! you will love. my skin looks so much healthier and smoother and AMAZING!!|`|ua9zB4vTaa	acne really sucks, and if it bothers you that much the only thing i can suggest to you would be to go to a dermatologist. the only thing that works perfectly for me is acutane, but there are other things out there that have worked for plenty of people. i started going to one when i was 11 and it's been a long battle, but i'm now 19 and my skin is figuring itself out. the best thing you can do though is to go to a doctor and have them try different things.. as soon as my dermatologist thinks things aren't working as well as they were before he tries something else. do this and you'll be able to keep it under control until you outgrow it.     good luck, and don't let it get you down. people aren't looking at your skin- they're listening to what you have to say. the only people that are going to notice are the people who are just as self conscious about themselves as you are about your acne.|`|VS0kwA71aa	Well, first of all i would go to a dermatologist. They will talk to you about your options, medications, and other systems that could get rid of or at least decrease your acne problem.    If you're looking for a quick solution (lotions, washes etc.) then i would recommend something like neutrogena or clearasil. But i will tell you right now, DO NOT GET PRO-ACTIVE! The results are not typical and only work for a very very few number of skin types.    I hope this helps.

If you want to wear less makeup then the only thing I would suggest is try a lighter shade of eyeliner maybe, or you can use a thinner line when you put your eyeliner on.|`|sFPV2KbBaa	beauty advice: if it takes more than 20 seconds per eye, its generally too much makeup.  i wear eyeshadow, liner, mascara, lip liner, lipstick and gloss.  It takes me less that a minute to put it all on.  and it looks natural, like highlights to my natural skin and eyes.  i go earth tones, browns blues greens reds.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	The 'what I want to do' picture looks  a lot better.

Wear that style for a few days and then use less on the top. After a while of wearing less, people will get used to that and not remember you with all the makeup on.|`|rF8bt4lqaa	i actually like how you did your eyeliner on both. you should probably use like a nude color for eyeliner, if you are considering of changing your eyeliner style.|`|BepmhQEyaa	replace foundation with tinted moisturizer or bronzer or fake tan and just start wearing mascarra instead of all the other stuff so it looks like you're not wearing as much makeup but you still look 'naturally' pretty. try to not wear makeup at all some days and maybe some days you feel like it do yourself up. remember though... its just school... try not to wear makeup everyday...not too good for your skin at this age anyway. cheers|`|WvzqudHOaa	hun, i really don't see a difference so wear less on monday.|`|0pskgmbmaa	Hey! I think you should use a little less eyeliner, and a little more mascara. Slightly defined eyes and great lashes look fantastic and natural on anyone. You can slowly decrease your amount of liner, until you have almost none. You could also try using a highlighter (a light eyeshadow - white, or light nude) in the inner corner of your eye. While it is technically 'more makeup', it will make your eyes look open and expressive, but natural.   I hope this helps!! xoxox

WGBWblFxaa	Ttry using a tinted moisturizer,instead of liquid and exfoliate before hand. My skin gets really dry in the winter so it is a must for me. Are you using a powder? You may want to skip that step because it can make you look cakey. Try something very sheer and light weight.  Put the concealer on first. Be careful with how much. It helps to use a brush. THEN apply the liquid or tinted moisturizer. Next use a pressed powder and take a brush and tap it over the areas you applied concealer to, it will prolong your concealer.|`|ZkuYBUByaa	Well I do not wear much makeup, but go to Youtube and type in make up and there are a ton of tutorials of how to apply makeup.|`|9lldaKNVaa	ok first of all, make sure your concelaer is liquid (covergirl clean makeup works great) and it is a tad bit lighter than your skin tone, so i looks natural. then use a loose powder foundation and apply that with a brush after you blott on the concelaer. i hope this helps = ]|`|zpovg4U7aa	maybe it's the brand of makeup. the quality of makeup really matters. try a department store and find something that fits for you (i like MAC and chanel, i switch on and off between the two).    also make sure to moisturize before you apply makeup so that the makeup settles on your face a little better. well, you should be moisturizing every day anyway.    get a foundation brush or a sponge and dab a little bit (again, a little bit) and apply them onto your face. concealer should go after foundation and make sure that the concealer is the right color and dab (and pat, dont rub) the concealer onto your skin until it blends in with the rest of your skin.    if this doesnt work, you should go in for a makeup session at a department store. they'll definitely help with the right makeup, the right application, right colors, etc. :)|`|sbiCl376aa	1. wash your face..to start on a clean canvas  2. apply some face moisturizer   3. apply concealer in needed places  4. apply foundation with sponge or foundation brush 9try a cream foundation instead if your face is too dry)  5. to seal the makeup apply a pressed powder  6. if you desire apply eyeshadow, mascara or lip gloss   DONE!!!|`|szh84bIDaa	Well, here is a step by step regine.    Step 1.  Always wash your face with a scrub or just soap and water before you apply anything to your face, same with your hands always wash them before applying anything.  Step 2.  Make sure you have the right foundation and concealer. Make sure the concealer is a tad bit light than your natural skin tone and make sure your foundation is the correct colour.  Step 3.  Apply the concealer with either a small brush or fingers. The best parts to apply  concealer is under the eyes and on blemishes or spots.  Step 4.   Make sure your foundation and concealer is in the correct tone so you don't have an uneven skin tone. You wouldn't want to go out with half your face darker than the other half would you?  Step 5.   Apply whatever else your are going to wear. In other words seen as you are new to wearing make up, I would go for a peach blush, natural eye shadow and a clear lip gloss. Not too much to start with.    Well I hope this is the correct answer for your question.  Good luck!|`|wR3cwcXWaa	concealer on the frusterating pimples and thats it! then put dots of foundation on your face and rub it in! thats what i do and it looks amazing!

uttbqGB9aa	If you want to remain classy and elegant but natural, go with some nude or pale pink shadow and cinnamon at the outer corners of your eyes. Line the bottom lids with a brown and a very very thin line on the top. Use wing effect for added drama. Then apply a light almost translucent pink gloss. and brown mascara, one or two coats but make sure to clear any clumps.     Use a very subtle pink blush with light gold powder along your cheekbones for more luminance to your face.     If you want a more dramatic look, use the same technique but apply darker brown at the corners and use a little bit more eyeliner focusing more on the bottom lower line and UNDER the lash line.    maybe add a slight darker shade of your lip color as gloss.

Modesty is a huge deal and I'd HIGHLY suggest you bring a cute cardigan or sweater to cover your shoulders. Having bare shoulders will be frowned upon at the ceremony. Feel free to take it off at the after party though.    For your makeup do something really subtle. This day is all about your friend becoming a woman.  So makeup really isn't that important.  You should have light eyeliner and some clear lipgloss.  Hope I helped :)

Salons in Western nations offered the service to Middle Eastern clients for decades before European and American women became interested and the popularity of eyebroweyebroweyebrow threadingthreadingthreading skyrocketed. The hair removal technique is not just for the eyebrows: threadingthreadingthreading can be used to remove other facial and body hair as well.    The technique is sometimes listed on salon menus as khite or fatlah, which are both Arabic words for threadingthreadingthreading. EyebrowEyebrowEyebrow threadingthreadingthreading involves twisting a piece of thread, usually cotton, into a double strand. This double stranded thread is used to pick up a line of hair and then remove it, creating a very clean, precise hairline. EyebrowEyebrowEyebrow threadingthreadingthreading is the technique preferred by Indian movie stars, who are often distinguished by their crisp brow lines.    EyebrowEyebrowEyebrow threadingthreadingthreading can be used to eliminate a unibrow, raise the arch of the eyebroweyebroweyebrow, or add shape and definition to the brow. Because it removes hair by the follicle, it is a reasonably long lasting hair removal technique as well. Repeat visits after three to four weeks are standard. The technique is also not terribly expensive because it is easy to do quickly and does not require costly chemical ingredients. For women who would like to pursue a more natural beauty regimen, eyebroweyebroweyebrow threadingthreadingthreading is a good choice, since it does not use harmful products.    EyebrowEyebrowEyebrow threadingthreadingthreading is a preferred hair removal technique for a number of reasons. Unlike tweezing or plucking, eyebroweyebroweyebrow threadingthreadingthreading removes one clean line of hair all at once, making it much quicker and easier to shape the brows. EyebrowEyebrowEyebrow threadingthreadingthreading also will not harm the skin like wax and some depilatory creams can. If done correctly, the skin should not be red or irritated for more than a few minutes after the eyebroweyebroweyebrow threadingthreadingthreading session. Some aestheticians also find it easier to shape eyebrows using this technique than other methods available.    It is important to find an aesthetician who is experienced at eyebroweyebroweyebrow threadingthreadingthreading. Inexperience can result in uneven brows, hair breakage, ingrown hairs, or unnecessary pain. Most urban areas have a wide variety of spas offering eyebroweyebroweyebrow threadingthreadingthreading, and many online resources offer reviews of the service, including photographs of clients. If you are unsure about a spa, look for one which is frequented by Middle Eastern and Indian clients with perfect eyebrows.|`|NYBo35zjaa	It's a form of hair removal, two threads pulled tight and rolled back and forth along the area the hair is to be removed and it hair gets caught between the fibers and pulls the hair out, it suppose to last longer than tweezing. Okay, what's wrong with that girl the keeps sayinig eyebrowing and threading 3xs in a row?

SpkWCvupaa	You go could to the pharmacy and pick up a package of oil sheet removers. It takes off some oil from your face. Or, you could buy some powder and dust your face. It will remove some of its shininess.|`|7tIzAz6Xaa	Use proactive Oh and i use oil blotting sheets 3 dollars at target|`|YZFk1Eu4aa	Here's what I do. I start with a clean face free of dirt, then I apply stick concealer over the red areas and under my eyes, then I put a liquid foundation over that and then I put on the powder over thats. This gives exelant coverage and the powder tends to soak ups the oils in the skin and gives your face a more matte type of texture. Just make sure after you apply the powder to use a make-up brush to lightly dust away any exess powder. Hope this helps. :]|`|jcGnBgAPaa	matte foundation and dust some loose powder over it|`|5dRvtaGgaa	It sounds like you have oily skin.  Wash your face with a product designed for oily skin and you should see a big difference.|`|9y7xSEinaa	Some people just have oily skin- it's genetic. There are steps you can take, though, to minimize the look of oily skin.   1) Get a great skincare routine. Get a skincare consultation from a derm or from a sales associate. Over-washing and over-stripping your skin can cause your skin to produce more sebum (oil). So be gentle  2) moisturize! You wouldn't think using lotion on oily skin would help, but it does. Get an oil-free mattifying moisturizing such as Lancome Pure Focus (just one example I can think of off the top of my head). Must be oil-free!  3) use an oil-free foundation. No oil. Nothing heavy with fragrance and pore-clogging ingredients.   4) also, use a powder as a touch-up or oil blotting papers. Clean and Clear, Sheiseido makes them as well.   Good luck!|`|YvuCN6qWaa	you can use a cleanser for oily skin, or carry around those oil dabbing sheets. i have a pack in my backpack i always bring to school and i use it when i go to the bathroom.|`|ceBdKjVBaa	use a matte foundation or use a compacted powder on your face.

Use the Clean & Clear oil blotter sheets during the day to remove excess oil. Good luck! Oh, and you can also use those oil blotter sheets on oily hair, too!|`|kgTMQixaaa	Wash your face everyday. I use this cleanser called Cetaphil.  Or you can use clean and clear moisturizer.  I hope this really helps!

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Use the yolk.  The yolk has most of the fat, which is the main ingredient making your hair smooth and shiny.  Beat the egg together before you put it on your hair. Leave it in your hair a few minutes, then wash it out.    Other oily food products, such as avocadoes or olive oil, can be used the same way.

That's like telling someone who is med school to become a doctor that in order for them to really understand what the pain is like having a broken leg, they should also break theirs. It's stupid.    I think what your teacher meant by "light makeup" is by wearing foundation. Nothing else comes to mind concerning a guy.|`|D7QdvWYDaa	If you instructor asks you to think about wearing "light make-up" why not just wear it in school and remove it when you leave? Have one of your "girlfriends" in class help you apply it so you will know what it feels like.    I would just arrive early enough and ask one of your student friends to help you apply the make-up before class. Your instructor will be pleased and you can always remove the make-up before you leave. You might even make a bold move and wear it home just to see what the reaction is and I wouldn't worry what other people think. Good luck and good for you!|`|Y2P9m21Gaa	dont worry about what other people think.  it would be awesome for you to understand whats it like to wear light makeup.  i think you should go for it!  im also in cosmetology school, i wish we had some guys!  light makeup.... i wear a little blush/bronzer and eye makeup.  you should ask your instuctor what he considers to be "light" because it can vary.|`|qAkbPzTLaa	Try it. If you get too many strange looks at the mall, it's not for you.

vUIoms0Gaa	Before you go to sleep put toothpaste on them over night then in the morning wash it off this should get rid of them or at least reduce them alot. do not scratch of pop them it makes them worse and can leave scars.  maybe try these to?    Tea Tree Oil  Tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial oil from the tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), which despite its name has nothing to do with tea the beverage. Many cosmetic products contain tea-tree oil, but you can also buy the oil from many pharmacies and health food stores. Dab a Q-tip in it and apply it on pimples.    The efficacy of tea-tree oil can further increased by hydrocortisone cream, which is available over-the-counter in many countries. Hydrocortisone is an an anti-inflammatory drug and the combination of an antibacterial and an anti-inflammatory is extremely effective for eliminating pimples    Baking Soda  Baking soda is one of those Martha Stewart remedies that are recommended for just about everything - but not without a reason, as it really is a multi-purpose miracle remedy. Besides removing unpleasant odours, baking soda can also make for a cleaner skin.    If the problem is just a single awful zit, you can dip a moist Q-tip in baking soda and smear it over the blemish. After 30 minutes, rinse the area. You can also wash your whole face with baking soda, but note that it is extremely drying for the skin and you should use a good moisturizer afterwards.    Be careful not to accidentally use baking powder instead of baking soda, as it tends to irritate the skin.    Toothpaste  Toothpaste is an old home remedy for pimples, and many people find it very effective. It is best used for those inflamed pimples that look like it just needs to grow a little bigger and you can conveniently pop it out of its misery.    To apply toothpaste, take a dab of it on your finger and spread over the pimple. If you have tea-tree oil, you can apply it first. For best results keep it on overnight (toothpaste dries into a dry putty that should not stain your pillow). If you need to pop the zit afterwards, wash your hands carefully before and afterwards or use a needle sterilized in a flame or by disinfectant.    The most effective solution to treat your zits at home that I know of is by using lemons. You can use it in many different ways, but the most effective for me is; Mixing 50% lemon juice and 50% rose water together, which you put onto a cotton pad and then apply to your zits and wash off after 20 minutes.    You can also use the zest from an orange, I've heard many great things about this treatment for zits. I have never tried it myself though.What you do with the orange zest is simple; rub it on your zits and leave it on for a minimum of 30 minutes! Simple as that!      hope this helps :)|`|sZ1rpEIDaa	take some ib profen or asprin...crush it up and a little bit of water (to make it like a cream) put it on each one over night and they'll be smaller or gone the next day...if they're smaller...just do it again...they should be gone though :D|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	hi :)      First, get a.....  -toner   -acne face scrub  -acne spot treatment  -washcloth   -an acne mask  -get it all in neautrogena    Step one  Take a washcloth and pour warm to hot water on it and put the washcloth on your face and leave it there for five minutes. You do this because the warm water opens up the pores so the medication can get deep into your pores. Once you've left it on for five minutes, pat your face dry.    Step two  Wet your face with warm water to keep the pores open and massage an acne scrub all over your face. Now rinse. There are little micro beads in the scrub that remove dead skin and the pimples      Step 3  Use a toner and pour it on a cotton ball and rub it on your face. Let it dry. The toner has a salicylic acid that clears pimples and gets the wrinkles off.    Step four   Get an oil free lotion and rub it on your face. Let the lotion dry. The salicylic acid that you just applied can dry out your face and you need to keep your face hydrated. So use an oil free moisturizer to keep it healthy.    Step 5  Use an acne spot treatment to clear up your worst pimples. Believe me the medication it uses really works.      -change your pillowcase. Oils from your hair and skin deep into your pillowcase while you sleep. and those oils can clog you pores  -put your hair up every night because the products you put in your hair can clog your pores every night and make your acne worse.  -get plenty of sleep  -take lots of vitamins and minerals  -eat healthy  -exersize  -stop popping pimples. This can leave scars and even make acne worse.     do this every night and don't stop either or the pimples will come back    by doing this you pimples should be gone by monday. hope I helped! :)|`|3MNnYbuvaa	ok i have the sae problem all u have to do is 3 times a day apply a drop of toothpaste(any kind)on each zit leave it on for 12 minutes and rinse off with cool water and vwahlah! the zits are gone hope i helped|`|cb34832d81fbb47ca6d2b03a33feba77aa	PIMPLES  Pimples is a unique skin disorder.Pimples are lesions that occur when the skins pores are obstructed or infected.They can form for a variety of reasons.However,the mechanism involved in causing some pores to collapse and block drainage of natural oils is not really understood. Pimples may also crop up for genetic reasons. It is not clear how it can be inherited from ones parents, but studies do indicate a high occurrence of pimples in children whose parents had it,too.  The pimples associated with adolescence almost certainly occur because of hormonal changes that take place during puberty. Both males and females get an overdose of the male hormone testosterone during this period,causing excessive generation of sebaceous fluids that invariably cause pimples.    GIVEN BELOW ARE A FEW SIMPLE HOME REMEDIES TO FIGHT PIMPLES.    1.The most basic form of pimple prevention is hygiene and preventive skin care. Regular washing of the affected areas with mild soap is a must.The soap need not necessarily contain any chemicals designed to prevent pimples .However, face washing should not be overdone or the skin will become dehydrated .    2.Care should be taken on makeup,moisturizers and other skin care products.If these products are oil based,it would just make the problem worse. Use water based products instead.    3.Generally we rub, press or squeeze our pimples.Dont when we do this,we risk spreading the bacteria to other areas.    4.Lemon juice diluted in water can be applied externally because of its antiseptic  quality.    5.Tea Tree oil can also be applied directly to infected pores.    6.Vitamin A tablets are also a natural and effective cure. Vitamin A promotes healthy skin.    7.Before bathing, apply a mixture of fresh tomato pulp, honey and rose-water to your face and keep for twenty minutes before washing off.    8.Juice of raw papaya is the best treatment for pimples.Apply fresh juice of raw papaya on pimples and get a good result.    9.Directly rub potato slices all over the face, helps to get rid of blemishes and  pimple scar.    10.Drink plenty of water and vegetable or fruit juices.    11.Use cucumber or other fruit and vegetable packs to cure pimple scars.    12.Maintain a diet that is rich in cottage cheese, salads, fresh juices, fish and  yogurt.These help to cleanse your system and ward off pimples.    13.Another overnight home remedy for pimples is to put a dab of toothpaste on it to help dry it out. Calamine lotion also will have the same drying effect.    14.Pound orange peel with water and apply to affected areas.    15.Another useful remedy for pimples is zinc. Which can be taken in a dose of 50 mg daily for a month and then reduce the dose.    16.You can clean your skin with apple cider vinegar as an overnight home pimple remedy.    17.Aspirin contains Beta hydroxy acid which is a powerful defoliant ,so you can crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.    Finally,certain medications may temporarily alter the hormonal changes prevalent during adolescence and cause pimple outbreaks. If this is the case, a simple adjustment in medication may be all that is required.|`|0UL9QcKbaa	Mix a half teaspoon of baking soda with a teaspoon of water. Mix it to make a paste and apply the paste on the pimples. Rinse off when it dries. Do this today and tomorrow. The white stuff in the pimples should either "rise" and make them easy to pop or shrink in half. You can cover the red scars they leave, with concealer. However, don't do this if you have sensitive skin or if you're on your period because it will irritate it. If you want to try it, first test on a patch of skin where no one would notice to see how your skin would react to it.

I kept telling my supervisor to go when her daughter was looking for prom and she kept going every other place finally went and not only did the girl find exactly the dress she had in mind, she found shoes and accessories, father very happy with price spent less than $200 for everything and the bonus was she didn't even see anyone in the same dress but different color.  There's also a awesome formal dress store in Haddonfield NJ, called Shimmer off of Kings Highway, You can take the Patco High Speedline to Haddonfield station and walk down 1 block on Kings Highway make a left. AND DO NOT go to the store on the corner of Kings Highway and Haddon Ave they are extremely rude
vkhQz16Laa	I say atleast 16.  When your at the age of 12-15, you can put make-up on but lightly, and use natural colors. Mascara is fine to use. I started to wear mascara at the age of 11. Approach your mom and just simply ask her if you can start to wear eyeshadow, lipgloss, ect.       Hope i helped!  ;D|`|pF3VmiqUaa	You should start wearing it when you are old enough to make your own money and buy it.|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	well I started wearing it at 12.

They're these sissors that have one normal side and the other looks like a comb. You can also buy them at a hair store or something like Target, Wallmart, or K Mart for like 15 dollars. It saves to just buy the sissors and do it yourself. I have really thick hair.   For the curls, either put your hair in rollers, or gel and crimp, or use a curling iron. just play around with your hair, usually when you're not trying, you get the best styles.|`|C8zrNMRjaa	getting layers might help, ask your hairdresser.|`|DVZNOlA5aa	give your hair banana curls and pin up some bangs (loosely) so it makes a bump on your head. use hairspray to lock it into shape.|`|Cz33YPNbaa	Wait so you want it thinner?

I'm sure she's got hairstylists at her beckon call to do it for her. You can achieve the same look on yourself if you take your time and use the correct products. You will need at least a 2" barreled iron. You should get one at Sally Beauty Supply. Hot tools are the best. Then you should invest in a good gel, heat protecting spray, and some really good hold hairspray. Then you take your hair in sections. Curl small sections and go from the ends up to the scalp in a vertical motion holding to the count of ten on each section. Let the curling iron go and spray each curl after. Then use a clip and poof up the top and clip it in. You should be good to go.

3e73d8c98dfc80052c68be6c3ba37270aa	You've already mentioned your height restricting you to being a catlogue/commercial model only (runway/high fashion would definitely require more height), but you have a great face for a commercial look.       I think you have great features for the camera.  Your eyes are great, but so are your lips, so I can see any feature you have translating very well depending on the product and/or what the client would want.    One thing I do notice about you is the issue with possible racial ambiguity.  Once on America's Next Top Model, a girl named April who was half caucasian and half Asian, was able to appear to have features of either race at any time.  Tyra mentioned it several times because it's a factor that's very versatile for photoshoots because it can appeal to anyone.  In your photos, I could assume that your African American, but I may also think that you have Asian features (because of your beautiful) eyes.  This would work for you because your look could be related to a larger mass of people (more would identify with you).  I hope that made sense.|`|77U2gV5daa	I hardly ever see anyone with model potential on here but I definitely think you are one of the few with a shot.  You are a unique pretty (which is good for models) and i love love love the last picture.  :)    I think you can do it! Good luck!|`|ezoKuZLgaa	You don't have the body or the face. I'm sorry but your features aren't proportioned correctly to come out good in pictures. My favorite feature would have to be your eyes though, very cat-like.     No offense but I would not choose modeling as a career or even a part time thing...|`|AOkucu5haa	Wow, you're gorgeous!|`|wmfJJLiDaa	your features and bone structure are amazing. DEFINATELY SOME HUGE POTENTIAL!!!|`|RD05jXYwaa	cute woks for me learn a trade. tmm|`|UFboADtfaa	I think your very pretty and your best feature is your eyes.|`|SSNcpI6qaa	the 2nd and 4th picture rocks!!! :) but i dnt see a model in you!|`|JpBlxPIaaa	Ummm ewwwwwwww gross NO!!!!   ur head is weird|`|3iPqpbDzaa	I did that when I was younger. Fun!    What is important is camera presence and being able to express things and beuaty with eyes and small facial emotions.  You need to find your angle, you can practise that, but you seem to have not just one good angle, but many! The photographer will help you find them too. Also, good skincare is important.    Height is important, but look at Kate Moss, she is a tiny short girl. Her face sells.      You are a very pretty girl, have fun and be safe!|`|fRWWUgMoaa	your face is a bit round and swollen. you do have distinct eyes but your skin tone is uneven. i dont really see the model in you....    sorry :C|`|q0QuOC3vaa	You are very pretty, your eyes are quite unique, which is something the modeling world likes, something that sets you apart from the other girls out there. Some pointers are in your photos, try to have a bit more posture and sit/stand up straighter. Also try to elongate your neck by moving into various angles.    But you are a very pretty girl and i think you have potential :]|`|AA11244758	Yes, you do.|`|hLKTxQDXaa	You're really cute and unique looking. I love the 4th picture! Your lips and eyes are both your best features.|`|6ix7aBSRaa	I think so. You're amazingly beautiful.|`|S8kx69vSaa	Yes!  Definitely!  Your sooo pretty, and definitely look like a model.  your eyes are gorgeous!|`|sMa56Y0Laa	Yes! Best feature is your beautiful eyes. :)|`|O0S189PQaa	omg!! your soo pretty|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Yes, You DEFINITELY have the model material in you!  Go for it girl, And by the way, I love the beauty mark.    :)|`|s5pIlUOxaa	You are pretty but,      nothing really pops out.  Most models are very very beautiful and I just dont think you are model material. But if it's something that you really want to do go for it but it will be hard.           And even though your not going to be a runway model, not all models get to choose what they want to do especially when your new. So no matter what you have to be ready to do what ever the agency wants you to do. Oh yeah and 5'3 is still very short for the fashion world. Soooo I am going to say NO you cant sorry good luck in the future.|`|KV09VNSUaa	You are REALLY pretty.Okay, so the beauty mark above your lip is breathtaking. I really want one now. Your eyes are pretty and almost almond shaped, and I think it goes perfectly with your skin and hair. Your hair is good short too, and I guess your fashion overall = great. Definitely flaunt that smile.|`|xGK8ihLgaa	you are veryyyy pretty and i think your best features are your eyes.you have a unique look,i like it.|`|a55c811df92734d3da6ba231bf1219e6aa	eyes 
ozwLZwXeaa	Darn those old pimples, I had them for years.  But not until my children were teenagers did I learn the trick of using a spot of toothpaste on that pimple after it was popped.|`|sHUnctqIaa	I have a hard time believing that the serous fluid coming out of your pimple is burning your skin. In any event, when you extract a pimple you need to continue to push softly until you see plain blood and no more of that oily substance. The blood coming through helps to clean the lesion and deliver white blood cells to kill the bacteria in the pore.     If it stings, it's because the oil and bacteria are mixing. If you continue to "pop" your zits at home please wear gloves and cover your fingers with tissue or cotton, continue to wipe the debris as you push it out with a cotton ball soaked with hammamilis astringent (whitch hazel) or any other toner.   If after you have a zit you are seeing a red mark where it used to be, that is not a burn it's post inflammatory hyper pigmentation. It's caused by the trauma and swelling from the pimple and will fade in a few days, although in some cases it can last a few months. It's a very common occurance.    Do not put toothpaste on a pimple especially after it's popped, while it will try it out you can also spread bacteria creating another zit, and the toothpaste will most certainly causes dermatitis which is reddening and flaking of the skin.|`|pA1UubScaa	i have the same problem. i put a spot of honey on with a q tip and leave it for ten min. works everytime.
b7TueUUPaa	its all about how you word it. "wow! i can smell your hair from here. it smells really good. what do you use?"    or III would reccomend herbal essences.. apparently its "really bad" for your hair.. but it smells amazing from far away and up close.    and i also really like biolage. its a little more expensive, but it really makes your hair look great. and i LOVE the smell! it smells so clean! its white with a green leaf on it. hope i helped|`|MxdOSmKUaa	Sunsilk smells amazing.  so does Redken. :D|`|UspK4SQBaa	That could be anything.

I would get one on the shoulder blade though. Tramp Stamps make you look trashy. But thats just my opinion. Yea some guys think it looks sexy, but are those really the kind of guys you want to be attracted to you? Ones who look for slutty girls?|`|9TE9lOKBaa	Depends which area has the most fat.  Fatty areas tend to be more painful.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	I don't think one of those would be significantly more painful than the other. I have a tattoo on my right shoulder blade and it wasn't too bad. But a tattoo lasts for life, and the pain lasts minutes, so I'd recommend getting it wherever you think will look best.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	It would be less painful on the shoulderblade. But it's still going to hurt, no matter what. And if you want it on your lower back, you go ahead and get it on your lower back. They do not make one look trashy unless you're dressed trashy too. I say get it wherever you want to, it's your body.|`|H3PcFertaa	You get the tattoo that you want in the place where it should be. You don't decide by how much it hurts to get it!

I mean, do you have a sensitive back? I do, i hate anyone that tickles or touches it. I would rather get it on my shoulder or my ankle, maybe.

I have brown eyes, and I accidently bought dark brown thinking it was black, and it still looked good.|`|tKzgp6Knaa	Eyeliner depends on a lot of things.  Hair color/skin color/ eye color can all effect   how well a certain color looks on a person.  I have green eyes and typically a black tends to make  them pop more.  Brown eyeliner is mainly better for people with lighter eyes.  Although, I would recommend getting 3 or 4 different shades  to switch up your look and keep it interesting.  Hope it helped.  Good luck :)|`|b7TueUUPaa	black. ALWAYS black.    friendly reminder: don't ever ever ever wear eyeliner without mascara.  biggest pet peeve ever! lol|`|c88Z21chaa	depends what look ur goin for.

I know you want something from your closet, but those are both really cheap.     For shoes, I would go with ballet flats or some low heels (it is a dance, after all; be comfortable).     Wear some earrings (preferably dangly, not just studs), maybe hoops (they match everything if they're just silver or gold). Try a few bracelets together, and definitely a necklace if your dress is strapless and/or shows a lot of your chest off (not cleavage, but below your neck).     Keep in mind that you should stick to a color scheme of either silver or gold. Don't wear clothing/jewelry that mixes the two. To keep with the holiday, I really suggest incorporating some kind of pink/red/white into your outfit. Black and/or grey is really not appropriate, and you'll come off as a little dismal rain cloud.    Have fun!    :)

WxEzm6NKaa	i know im a guy but...  liquid works better  but if you put on powder first, and then put on liquid, it works even better    yes dampen them    downwards? just apply in a downwards motion...|`|AA11866559	cream concealer is best  I like liquid foundation tho    yes, dampen the sponge    down: start at your cheekbone (for foundation) and stroke down toward your jaw, do this all over|`|VN2wyTnFaa	I prefer liquid concealers because powder concealers can end up looking really cakey. As far as foundation goes, it sort of depends on what kind of skin you have. If you have oily skin, go for the powder foundation, but if you have dry skin, go for the liquid. If you combination skin then use whichever once is best for you, and if you have normal, you can use whatever you want. (PS-- if you're using a powder foundation and a liquid concealer, put the concealer on first, then then foundation).     With the makeup sponges, you don't necessarily have to dampen the sponge first, but it doesn't really hurt. Try it dry and wet and see which way you like best.    When I'm using a sponge, I actually dab it on, that way there's no chance of getting any sort of streaking at all. Hope that helped! Good luck!|`|KTMb7rcvaa	Liquid foundation is best if you have drier skin, especially.  Powder foundation feels lighter, and looks very natural.  It's also one step.      The best thing to do is to apply a light foundation, and no you don't have to dampen the sponge.  Then, use a little powder (this helps it stay fresh).      My friend always puts powder on all during the day over her foundation, but that's not a good idea.|`|9lldaKNVaa	liquid concealer works way better because you can apply it easier to problem areas. once the concealer dries use a brush and apply loose powder foundation. hope this helps = ]|`|YZFk1Eu4aa	Here's what I do for the best coverage. 1st I use concealer and I put it on any red areas and the area under my eyes. Concealer has better coverage than liquid foundation but its more of a thick and cakey type texture, so after the concealer I use some liquid foundation and cover my whole face and blend in well. Then I use a powder foundation over the top of that, I find its just good to finish the look off and it soaks up any parts that seem to be shiney.Just make sure you use your make-up brush to lightly dust off any access. Make-up sponges are awesome and offer a much finer and refined look then applying make-up with your fingures. You don't need to dampen them at all, just put a dab of make-up on the sponge. Then dab lil dots of foundation on your forid, nose, cheeks then chin. When you blend start blending from the top and work down, small circular motion twists of the sponge are what you need, just try to be gentle to yor skin and don't pull at it too much and you should be fine. :]    Hope this helps. :]

xEZclTh4aa	hot topic   $15|`|Fpj8lR5qaa	You should be able to find a plain black or brown 1 1/2" wide leather belt strap for around $10.00. Kohl's often has a nice Levis belt strap on sale for around $8.00. Sometimes you can find nice ones at Express Men. Gander Mountain used to carry some nice, heavy duty Carhart belts. They were a bit more expensive and came with a plain buckle that snapped off.

I also love hoodies from bass pro etc. You can shop anywhere and make it look a little country. Since we have to look nice, we get a nice shirt like a t-shirt with a little print on it or something on cold days we wear long sleeved shirts under them that match, other wise, just throw your boots and jeans on and hit the road :)|`|m8VVCrKkaa	Okay, unlike Ashley D I'm going to try to give you a good answer. I live an a small country town with a lot of rednecks in it.    A lot of country girls in our town wear plastic rhinestone bracelets like this one http://antiques.tace.com/thumbnails/jpg/... with earrings to match. There are also cowhide belts with rhinestones in them like this one. http://us.st12.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I...    Other than that the country girls at my school wear wrangler jeans, cowboy boots, their hair in a ponytail, and their backpacks.    Edit: Sorry, for shirts they just wear whatever, sometimes t-shirts sometimes polos.
QfDMnFddaa	I know all about the brownish-pink spots.  They are from newer acne scars that are in the process of healing.  The good news is that these are usually the easiest type of acne scars to eradicate.    Someone mentioned microdermabrasion which is highly effective, but usually is reserved for more severe type scarring and it is a very expensive process. (not to mention extremely painful)    I used a product that uses a cream to lighten the discolouration of the scarring and usually you can see results by your 3rd week.  I hope you find it helpful, it fixed up my scars.  Good luck.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	bio oil! It's only been a month and I have seen major improvements on my scares :)|`|AXS4qkMgaa	Go to a dermatologist and see if you can get a microdermabrasion.  After 4 to 5 treatments, you will see a decrease in the severity of acne scars AND the size of your pores.|`|qYVJHc7Yaa	Firstly, I would like to recommend "KIEHLS" Blue Spot Herbal Treatment for your acne as it is very popular in HK, It costs around $200+.,    For make up, I think it is better for you to use the base without oil, so Shu Uemura Moouse make up base, it costs $300, (w/ 2 different colors), and use its' liquid foundation that its can last longer.  Any other products relating to make up or skin care, you can consul the beauty advisors or http:www.shuuemura.com.

9y7xSEinaa	There are many reasons why you might not be getting lots of wear out of your nail polish.  1) you need to make sure your nails are completely dry and oil-free before you polish. this means using acetone remover on your nails to get rid of any traces of oil, hand lotion, soap, etc.   2) you need to use a great base coat. Something by Orly, sally hansen, etc.   3) apply two coats maximum. Chips happen the same way they do with house paint on walls- the more coats, the more chips. don't glob it on.  4) use a quick-dry spray or a top coat like Seche Vite (my personal fave).     Also, you can reapply seche vite every day to make your manicure last.     China Glaze, OPI, and Essie all have wider brushes so you use less polish. I also like Chanel.|`|fYox2mwGaa	I recently bought a bottle of Sally Hansen nail polish that claimed to resist chipping for 10 days.  HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!  I had chips on every nail by the end of the first day.  I used to be a huge Sally Hansen fan but I don't like it so much anymore.  It seems overpriced when it only lasts a day.  I've tried Maybelline's Express Shine polish.  I really like it because I can put on 2 coats and it dries in less than 5 minutes.  It's so nice to be able to paint my nails in the morning at work and have them dry so fast that you can wait on customers not even 5 minutes later and you don't have to worry about smudges.  I recently bought some NYC and Wet N Wild paints and they perform much like Maybelline.    Having said that, I do have to do some MINOR touch ups, which I don't mind.  Usually I work and I type all day so I do get a little nick here or there.  I can usually wear a color for 4 or 5 days and then I get bored and switch it out.  The cheaper brands that I listed before can make it that long with a touch up here or there.  I don't use a topcoat though (I've found it makes the paint peel faster and I'll sit and peel it all the way off when I'm bored at work).  That's pretty much what I stick to.    Hope this helps... Good Luck!|`|VRlhfsfeaa	Sally Hansen works amazing, stays on long, and there r awesome colors.|`|hLKTxQDXaa	in my experience, O.P.I. is the best|`|50edd02d99399e9e8543b66cc41e9314aa	for a long wear  nothing lasts as long as revlon colorstay nail polish but it doesnt come in very many shades and most are reds and mauves.. but i like opi nail polish im a nail technician..x

8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Yellow does look good with brown hair -- but it really depends on what shade of yellow, and the actual color of your hair.  I have brown hair with gold/reddish highlights, and some brighter shades of yellow look awful on me!  Try light or warm shades compared to very vibrant shades and see what looks best on you!

nhLakq35aa	I think they probably use stage makeup because they have to have it last so long and in warm weather. Ben Nye is a really popular theatre makeup brand. You can also use makeup paints under regular makeup to make colors more intense and last longer.
dqSqlArRaa	Well, technically your hair IS growing but the split ends cause the hair to break further and further up the hair shaft, making the ends of your hair shorter, and that is why it gives the appearance that the hair is not growing.|`|l6PeuLOOaa	your hair starts breaking at the ends and it grows uneven.. it is growing though but as your hair gets longer it grows slower.. so i hope i helped :)

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Stop being silly, blacks come in every skin tone under the sun.    To grow your hair long you have to keep your hair from breaking off because this will help you retain length. You have to stop doing things that damage your hair, such as using a lot of heat. I don't know if you're natural or relaxed and that matters as far as how you would take care of your hair. Your question is too general to answer because I don't know the condition of your hair, the products you use, or your hair regimine, or type.    http://www.longhaircareforum.com will give you lots of advice and tips.|`|woxz5TrDaa	I'm taking a suppliment called Biotin. It's great, you can get it everywhere, like CVS, Target, GNC.  I also take a suppliment at GNC called Ultra Nourish Hair. When I was doing research on it, plenty of women, all types agreed that it worked wonders! I've been taking it for about a month and a half and my hair is stronger, healthier, and deffinantly growing faster than it ever was. People complain that the pills are huge, but they're not that big and are easy to swallow. I take 2 Biotin and Ultra Nourish Hair every morning, and a Biotin before I go to bed. My hair is it's healthiest it probably has ever been. Eating healthy foods, and Vitiman E help as well.|`|v4gUI96yaa	I am white but i have two girls that are half black and i understand where you are coming from.start with washing your hair only three times a week.I use a paul mitchell shampoo and conditioner called super skinny, the days you do not shampoo just condition.Also they have a deep conditioning treatment too,use that only once a week.For styling i would suggest a type of grease,called miracle grow.you can buy these cheap at a drug store|`|f5XwQEjyaa	You're not black, not your avatar, anyway.
ebPFLkyeaa	That same thing happened to me, but worse - my brother shaved half of my right eyebrow off. I bought an eyebrow serum from the Anastasia brand, you can google it or find it in a Sephora store (or their website, sephora.com) and just applying the gel everyday for about a month helped the hair follicles begin to grow back.    My eyebrows are now thick and back! But, while I was waiting for it to grow back with the eyebrow serum...    I went to walmart and bought eyebrow pencil and lightly drew it on. It should work well with you and will go unnoticed since he only took out the arch part of your brow. Find your shade and it'll blend nicely.    Best of luck!  That wasn't a very funny joke!|`|axheoEN4aa	Well just go get plastic  surgery and you wont need an eyebrow job|`|YuPNVX9maa	use an eyebrow pencil and fill in the gap.|`|gXXCBlVQaa	maybe try to thin it out by making sorta a arch again|`|NgxG5Ayqaa	Use tiny little eyebrow scissors to make all of your eyebrow hair shorter and color in the entire eyebrow with eyebrow pencil|`|P4RZK3dyaa	use a tweezers, pluck it evenly and do the same for the other side.

I'm assuming (and really hoping not) that you work in the tattoo industry somewhere? PLEASE tell me the name of your shop and where it is so I can remember not to go there. Surely this is the sort of thing you learn in Lesson 1 of Basic Tattoo Hygiene??
nz8q1tDfaa	What caused this was when she put your streaks in she used a lightner first.  If you had un-coloured hair (virgin hair)  this would not have been necessary unless your hair was naturally black.  Do not worry this mishap is not your own.  Instead it was her.  When she lightened your hair she only needed to make it light enough to give you a bright red,  what she did was lift your hair soo light that the red would not only fade but fade quickly.  what i suggest is going back to the person who did and ask for a much darker red.  It's scary I know but if you think about it the really dark red has more of a violet undertone will be really bright when put on blonde hair.  It takes longer to fade and not only that but it'll end up looking auburn when the brightness does fade.|`|9IhgFvuLaa	Its possible you didnt get permanet dye color.|`|HvHBF8glaa	You problable put too much shampoo!!!

12ORrojXaa	i would suggest your inner wrist.  i have several tattoos including an anchor and nautical star on my left inner wrist.  i am a professional (licensed social worker) and it has not had a negative effect with my employment.  it is definitely a hard one to hide, but if it's your daughter's name i doubt you would want to.  best of luck to you!!|`|Ffgzipq5aa	I would say on your other ankle/foot area.  The wrist would probably look nice but even if it is small it could turn out to be a problem with future employment.|`|jf1oPsSeaa	definately do it on the back of your neck.    and if you just want it small, then do it like curving around your foot.|`|b7TueUUPaa	i got my deceased father's initials on the back of my neck. i love it there.
4a7f262367ce439921ed41cf674ac9e8aa	Mineral make-up is actually healing to the skin. Apply it with a brush in circular motions in order to break up the minerals. MAC lipglosses offer a wide variety of colors but it isn't necessarily the best out here.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	It really depends on which one you're comparing it to. Some mineral makeup can basically be the same, but when you go for lower end brands there can be lots of unnecessary fillers and whatnot in them which make the quality worse. I definitely agree with you on the lipgloss thing though. I just don't see the point in spending like, $15 on a lipgloss with comparable quality to something I can get for $1. There are other brands of mineral makeup that you can try out like Everyday Minerals (www.everydayminerals.com) or Earthen Glow Minerals (www.egmineralmakeup.com). Both of those companies offer mineral makeup for a reall good price. Hope that helped! Good luck!|`|KG3MptIdaa	I worked for Vikki's (I was a CSL for two years) the lip gloss is crap, taste good, but crap.     I love MAC make up so I am probably bias... Only thing is the lip glass is thick, so you need to make sure you don't purse your lips together a lot or you could mess up your look if you have a lip color on underneath.     Cheaper lip glosses are usually thinner in texture and come off more easily, there is nothing wrong with them, it's your preference on what you want from your particular look.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Bare Minerals is the best i have found.
7c6bf2a89333b3e48583a9b2b10a3231aa	I have it, and it really is great. It's best to find a BareEssentuals store to have someone inform you of the colors right for your face and learn how to use the brushes and how to apply it right.     It will definitley cover up any pink skin or pimples, but dryness can't be covered up. Sometimes my skin is dry, all you can do it mouisterize. Any powdered makeup makes drying a little bit more noticeable but just apply mousterizer after it.|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	great stuff def. try it out|`|xoXkHOVsaa	I love it!  It will definitely cover the redness, and if you put a moisturizer on before you won't have a problem with dry skin.  The company sells a moisturizer, but I just use Olay and it still works fine.|`|zpovg4U7aa	mineral powder may dry out your skin more if you already have dry skin. if you dont have breakouts but just need a little evening out of the skin, then you should look into tinted moisturizers. MAC tends to be a little too thin in my opinion but clinique has good ones.    i used to use bare minerals but i have oily skin, but i got bored of it and got sick of the dustiness. i found better makeup to suit my face at MAC and chanel, so thats what i use now but i also used to use clinique. i have a friend who has very clear skin and just wants to have a bit of something on her face and she likes the clinique tinted moisturizer 'cause its not too thin and does a little something.     i would give that a try.|`|QDccno7Yaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out a few different ones.This is a good review website at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and browse the reviews.
YbO7D6axaa	Bare Minerals is it's own company. It's not under $25 either. So ignore them. ;) I'd say go with Covergirl AquaSmooth. It's really hydrating for your dry skin and will look flawless on acne-free skin. The Covergirl Radiance Advanced is for older women looking for coverage and firming. Just to let you know. But I'd also recommend Maybelline Whipped Foundation. I've never personally used it but I've heard great reviews about it. :)|`|B29boGPcaa	this is exactly $25 but totally worth the money!! :) :    http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...      you can buy it online or in sephora stores, and they'll let you try it in stores :) x|`|gh2FdQ7waa	bare minerals  anything that's hypoallergenic--oil free|`|L5k3OMAyaa	I use Loreal Bare Naturale Powder or their liquid true match.  My pores don't clog, it looks great and doesn't get too shiny! best of all, it's definitely under $25.|`|RGSSYFPyaa	Bare Minerals by i think its cover girl  it will even your skin tone   its about $10   :) its a powder.

z6sTfQ0Qaa	yes it will turn ur finger green unless it says sterling silver or gold    but if you really want it also buy some clear nailpolish and put a light coat on the ring every week this will keep ur finger from turning green!     lia sophia is also way over priced for what you get in my opinion   but they do have really cute stuff! i own a few pieces that i really like
SpkWCvupaa	no, you get a tan by being exposed to ultraviolet rays, which you can get from the sun and tanning salons. You do realize that this is harmful for you because UV rays can cause mutations in your skin cells and you might get some kind of skin cancer. The whole reason you get a tan is because your skin is producing something that is supposed to protect you from UV rays.|`|5G6fnWeaaa	do not listen to any of the other answers!!  they clearly dont know as much as they think the do  my sister worded at sunset tan in orange county, california for 9 years and she never one did spray on or fake and bake.   there was this huge light fixture on the celing in her room and she tanned under it every other day and she would get so tan!  it works, and its better for your skin and cheaper.     go for it! you will look amazing|`|1wNsBNmxaa	nope not at all lamps do not have any uv rays to give you a tan     Graveworm66~~~?|`|l5zJ1bldaa	you can't tan unless you have UV rays.  normal lightbulbs don't have them.    so unless you have a tanning bed at your house, you can't actually tan inside of it.|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	No you would not. Tans don't just happen from heat. You could make s'mores though.|`|cXj0RqExaa	No, you cannot tan under a lamp. :p|`|7mmmGytpaa	do lamps have UV rays? no.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	No,   lamps don't contain UVA rays (which are the rays that make you tan).   Don't be silly.   And be happy with the skin you've got, don't be desperate.|`|dSp6BEdgaa	no you cant from like that kind of lamp.  lolz|`|9s7Uf2w6aa	yeah totallly (:  it works reallllly!  try it, it worked for mee! im really tann!
Na7aCxUgaa	HI Holly     I am casting my vote for the Dolphin ! I have seen many dolphins in the wild they are magnificent animals  As far as where. I think that should be a matter of personal taste for You   Only you should decide where it goes  Think about it   We don't see the entire you as you do .!    I like your quote " get a life instead of answering a question     with  an insult to a complete stranger that's done nothing    to you "   OK  EVERY ONE  lets hear it for Holly      HORAY|`|blbd7e1Qaa	First alternative Dolphin appears artistic...    Third alternative is more like Christmas decoration ("too seasonal", unless you marry someone of Santa's staff and live amongst Reindeers)...      So, my answer is: The dolphin...|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i liked the dolphin tatoo the best out of all your choices...i'd put it where you suggested...i think that that would look real nice...i'm a fan of tattoos myself...only have one though...on my right calf...i'd like to get another one though...a butterfly perhaps.|`|B56wTXSGaa	i would have to say get the kanji symbol because it will match the other one. but why dont you go to your artist. he can give you better advice than anyone here. plus it'll be one on one|`|Ffgzipq5aa	I like the dolphin for the spot you have chosen.  I agree with the other poster that I think the holly would make a nice foot/ankle tattoo though.  Also, I like the blue color you have around your kanji tat.|`|koS5dhJ2aa	I like the dolphin out of those three. I think the placement will be really easy to hide.|`|dbfb8185661f046a9017398b63ebcc44aa	Dolphin would be good on back of shoulder or ankle.  Kanji, forearm above wrist or upper shoulder  Holly , a bit different which is cool because of meaning inner left breast so your dad would always be close to your heart.    Personally none of them do anything for me, but it is your choice, I would chose the dolphin but not in it's present form. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be tribal it gives the impression it wants to be but just lacks. For the location your thinking I would go with a more colorful picture like drawing.  Happy inking !|`|jeHTjvbaaa	I think the other Kanji symbol would be nice on the opposite side of your hip, placed opposite to the first tattoo.  Also, the mistletoe leaf is kinda out of place.  Oh, btw, if you plan on only getting one or two more, you will probably end up with more, they are soo addicting lol =P|`|WiIUEObTaa	the dolphin is fantastic. but for your father the holly berry. is the best choice. i think two more artworks would be great. for your emotianal sake. please do not take offence. the holly berry first. then the dolphin. the problem will be after the emotion of the holly. will you want the dolphin. possibly next year the dolphin. the holly is just pure emotianal artwork. as older person different prespective. it would be impossible to merge dolphin with the holly. it can be done easily. but would destroy the meaning of the holly. now i am confused. like holly. thank you it just strikes me as pure emotional class .|`|IPkzHYdraa	The other Kanji tattoo would go well well with the "strength" idea.     I personally think the Holly may look better on a foot or ankle.    && sorry, but I'm not too fond of dolphin tattoo's.|`|H3PcFertaa	I think that the dolphin would look good even around your 1st tattoo, with a little more of the blue and maybe a suggestion of water or wave. Otherwise, it could go just about anywhere.  The kanji also could go with the 1st one or opposite side of your body, done in the same manner. It could go anywhere, really, and at any time.  Try printing out a copy and taping it on different parts of your body to see how you like it.    Now the holly is an adorable and personal image that is very cool. I like the idea of it on your shoulder blade, over your heart, on your forearm, or even the calf. I can see it also with elaborate lettering with flourishes that say Hollyberry , maybe under the image, and maybe in a script like this:  http://images.veer.com/images/hear/type....  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2046/2234...    So, I vote for the Hollyberry idea, because it is so special to you.  good luck~
rdB2Pbldaa	If you have naturally long and thick lashes, clear mascara will give you a more natural look. It will seperate and define lashes, and holds curls if you use a eyelash curler. You can also use it to keep unruly eyebrow hairs in place. Good luck!|`|bpzjkAuTaa	hmmm...ive actually never heard of it. i think itd look really kewl w/ it looking wet, but my guess is its actually supposed to make them look thicker && longer, but if you dont like it get black (thats what i wear.)|`|yop2DPYvaa	i use clear mascara to shape and hold my eyebrows in place :) it does nothing for ur lashes!|`|4WtcddbVaa	I have clear mascara because my eyelashes are naturally long. I go to a school where make-up is not allowed. I wear clear mascara to make them stand out a little more, but since they are already really long, I don't wear the dark stuff. I just use an eyelash curler, clear mascara and go. If you don't have long to super long eyelashes, having clear mascara is kind of pointless!|`|5c6OBXtTaa	It helps girls who don't want to actually wear mascara or makeup. It doesn't necessarily make them longer or anything  but It's like combing your hair, it just makes them look better and more defined.|`|B29boGPcaa	it's supposed to add volume, shine and separate your eyelashes because some people's clump together and such. i don't like it at all hah :) x|`|4a7f262367ce439921ed41cf674ac9e8aa	I personally use it to tame my client's eyebrows. It holds them in place. I also use it for the lower lashes because there is nothing worse than clumpy, messy bottom lashes. Good Luck!!!

AA11548608	Try buying men's socks. They are thicker and more durable.     I dated a woman once who had the same complaint. The white socks she wore around the house were getting holes too quickly. Women's socks just aren't put together as well as men's, for whatever reason.    I'm just like you -- I refuse to wear shoes or slippers around the house. I love walking in my stocking feet, yet I probably only have to replace my socks once a year. Guys' socks just last longer.|`|lGSUToFQaa	i don't wear shoes in the house ever, and i wear slippers outside, my socks always get holes in the toe, rarely anywhere else, i went to walmart and bought all their socks for 1 each so if they wear out the weren't that much, i do have a few pairs with like grippers on the bottom and i like them i've had them for 2 years and they are still like new, i got them as a gift so i have no clue where to buy them, good luck on the socks.|`|nLGNSbjXaa	darn your socks :D  Or just buy some nicer socks [running socks] they dont wear out as fast|`|8uUpAKPtaa	do you walk around outside with just socks on? when I was a little kid i used to do that and my socks wore out like that...if thats not the case, stop buying socks from wal mart, they're cheap|`|5a5jZ1braa	Mine get dingy even with bleach.  I think it's just the material they use these days.  I wear the hanes socks now dont have that problem just get dingy.  I had the fruit of the loom & they did that...had my feet look dirty because i was wearing them out and holes just walking about the house.  The nail tech giggled when she tore the adams off my feet cause she knew i was a clean boy and dirty feet werent right...and dont get the bulk packs the ones with 16 pairs.  get the 5pack & below...a better quality.

WqkFJ2Pgaa	The earrings they use for piercing have a little notch that the back fits into so it won't slip off. It's very hard to get that back off; you may need someone with good fingernails to help you. Regular earrings don't have the notch, so from now on, you shouldn't have much problem.|`|3UaRXGWoaa	it shouldn'tt be hard to take out earrings...  did you take the back off??? ha ha, i shouldn't have to ask that..  just make sure you're pulling it straight out instead of at an angle.|`|PyC1MIkXaa	How hard is it to take off earrings?...|`|2SirTSyyaa	Some earrings have really loose things in the back (I dont know what they are called) the stuff that holds the earrring  Some have really tight ones.

p5iB0Ogkaa	Covergirl has a new mascara called Exact Eyelights that is designed to enhance your own eyecolor. It can make your eyes look 4 times brighter.     The product has pretty good reviews. Im thinking about trying it myself. I recommend this product, assuming you would prefer this cheaper alternative as oppose to, say, buying color contact lenses.|`|zpovg4U7aa	i hear you're supposed to use purple for brown eyes to bring them out. i like wearing purple eyeshadow or doing the smokey eye effect with a bit of darker purple and black. it does bring out my eyes, and they're brown.|`|DwoAaJB5aa	Sometimes experimenting with  different make-up products  such as eyeshadows  Try dark shades and lights to  see what fits you best.|`|YbO7D6axaa	Use products that are meant for certain eye colors. You have brown eyes but want them lighter, then use products like Almay. They have particular palettes, eyeliners, and mascara for all four eye colors. Get the one that's for either green or hazel eyes, not blue. Also, Covergirl has a brand of mascara meant for particular eye color called Exact Eyelights. I'd recommend that as well. :)      Or you could just get colored contacts... lol.

GYJSuTXIaa	This was my old hairstyle, and yes you will still be able to put it up in a pony tail.  But if you're trying to get all of your hair out of your face you will have to put in a hair band, because since it's a really shattered hair cut, the layers will fall out of the pony tail.|`|MiCPyFobaa	yea....just not all of it will go back    |`|FlKrA3nEaa	yes but you MAY have to put the layers in a clip or bobby pin. =]|`|aOPVxA6Daa	yeah. but you will probably have to use clips for the short layers and the bangs.|`|Q1uJmBesaa	the layers in the front and top will probably fall out. and the bangs. :/    probably not the best sports friendly cut, your forehead will get really greasy if you cant pin back your bangs.|`|JLdx0UQVaa	yeah if you pin back the layers|`|PfwbeUqnaa	wow, I love those seductive blue eyes!|`|iMAejoSUaa	ummm yeah! i have the same haircut, and it is awesome!this is me!  http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh285...|`|GVEXj9dIaa	ya but all the layers would fall out so youd have to bobby poin em up or somethin|`|A1YlBTkDaa	all the layers will fall out but it will look pretty cus like its a tiny pony tail iwth some layers hanging out :)|`|Xq8nStTfaa	yeah but all the layers will fall out|`|Fjv6D3lRaa	no.

Especially if it is a formal affair.|`|ILNNfCJSaa	I don't like it to be honest. : P|`|YQLmmEjQaa	Its actually quite different/unique looking , i especially like how it fits like tight around the waist to your legs , making you look like thin & its kinda classy/sexy looking .  The leopard print also gives it a little pop/flare , i suprisingly would wear it ;)  HONESTLY .lol however am not sure if you should wear it to a formal, maybe u should try something with colour/thats yes softer because this dress seems more for a party.*|`|3iB7bnJGaa	Well, for partying with friends it might be a little more functional...  But to a formal? No,sorry  It looks like a goth halloween costume. no offense|`|zN3C2NDzaa	This dress is more suited for a street corner (If you know what I mean) There is a fine line between sexy and slutty. While slutty is more fun it really looks stupid in pictures a few years down the road. If you don't believe me ask your mom to break out her year book. If you have a good sense of humor wear the dress and take lots of pictures. If not find something that really compliments you and your body. Don't turn into a carbon copy of some inane trend. Go classy not trashy.|`|tgYEXN8Gaa	The dress isn't too bad, but I really don't like the pink leopard print thing.  I agree with Valerie G.

AIY0168Jaa	They're both really pretty, I guess it depends on which one you feel more comfortable in :) If it were me, I'd buy the denim because it's more practical (I tend to fall a lot so the white one would most definitely get messed up) but I guess if you're graceful enough to pull it off, then the white one might be more your style. But they're both really cute and you should buy the one that you like the best. :) (and if you cant decide, buy one of them and mooch the other one off your parents or a friend :p)|`|Pz5rDlrZaa	go with the denim one|`|0JcJedLcaa	i like the denim one.|`|uvn609hsaa	I like the first one it's really cute.|`|FMcu6BNpaa	The white ones will get dirtier more often, I prefer the denim ones because I love denim, it looks cute, and it won't get as dirty as the white one!|`|O6JUN1yvaa	the whiteeeeeeeeeeee one its so cute i just bought it|`|Fb11LZdOaa	There both so cute XD  But I like the white but if there is some white jeans u should egt them instead XD|`|AAn9cfAnaa	I'd go with the denim one because denim matches with everything.

osp2ELq7aa	Acne is caused by a build-up of oil and impurities trapped in your pores.  Acne 'triggers' (actions/foods that tend to agrivate acne) are different with every person, but the most common are:  *You, or another person touching your face, which spreads bacteria.  *Acne being irritated by makeup or products. It is best to use products like cleansers and mosturises specifically developed for irritated and acne prone skin, these will often contain natural ingredients and be oil-free. It is best to use low irritation makeup such as mineral makeup, or any makeup that is oil-free, hypo-allergenic, and has some spf protection in it.  *Citric foods such as lemon, orange juice, and tomatoes have been known to aggrivate acne. (I have found this to be true) So stay away from foods/drinks with high sugar levels and acidic bases.    =]|`|MkyiYw1faa	touching your face is what really causes mine. i had REALLY bad acne on my forehead, and I was kind of young when I got it so I picked at them and that kept them anround for a while. Whenever you get a little patch of zits, put on acne treatment(I recommend OXY) and just forget about them . theyll be gone in no time!|`|H331wkQdaa	tuching ur face an eatting chacolta i ues oxy pad thins they work really goo an wash ur face twice a day|`|9Vjjr0M7aa	acne is caused by grease, for example if you wear a lot of makeup and dont wash it off you could get it, or if you touch you're face to much...|`|fwsn1VWsaa	Touching your face makes it worse.|`|MitVhIK9aa	unfortunally choclate will make it become really bad. . .|`|kigMX323aa	unfortunately for me, if u have a lot of allergies eating unhealthy foods like chocolate can do the job, all the junk in it like coating and sugar and artifital flavoring bothers your skin hope i helped!!|`|YbO7D6axaa	To clearify it, chocolate DOES NOT cause acne. If you get breakouts from eating chocolate, it's because you're allergic to it. So eat all the chocolate you want. If you want to make your acne worse, then touch your face, pop your zits, leave makeup on, don't change your pillowcases regularly, don't use a product to clear up acne, and don't wash your face regulalrly. But if you do want to clear it up, do the opposite of the things I just said. Also, clean your cell phone/home phone's screens off after you use them because bacteria likes to build up in those places and will just get back on your face and cause acne. :)
MksOlZaVaa	Over time, the oils on your face and hair rub off onto the pillow. And when your face has be in contact with it, the oils rub of onto your face and block pores and such. (ACNE)    Wash your pillow cases every week and alternate between different ones until the next wash.    EDIT - It also helps to wear a headband or keep your hair out of your face when you sleep. It keeps the oils from your hair away from your face.|`|69c729bbc40865df57b81abf4bbab3caaa	When you sleep, your face secretes natural oils that get trapped in the fabric of the pillowcase.  Sleeping on them night after night causes bacteria to become trapped from oils on your face and hair, which will in turn clog your pores causing acne.

Op37pHd3aa	if your hair is already damamged i wouldnt recommend getting one. They will do a quick treatment at the salon for you before starting the procedure. Theperm will last until you go back to the salon or depends on your hair type. and yes it is SUPER straight and glossy. but keep in mind after you get the magic straight ([japanese straightening] you cant curl your hair or wave it and putting it in a pony tail will leave a dent in your hair.|`|7aK81hsbaa	adding thermal heat to the chemicals has got to be harder on the hair.  chemical straightening is permanent, just like a perm- it lasts until the hair grows out. hope that helps you.|`|DySUxIn4aa	I can only answer one of your questions.. sorry. But um..it all depends on how often you use the straightener. Such as, if you do it everyday, your most likely going to get either fried hair or split ends. But if you trim it often, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Make sure you buy a serum or cream that protects your hair from the heat. =D|`|LAYrMHPZaa	if you wash your hair daily and get a hair cut atleast every 3 months then you dont have to worry about damage. Japanese straightening looks really great. just be caareful... it gets VERY hot.|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	I am a cosmetologist and have studied various relaxers depending on hair texture, porosity, etc.  The best thing for you to do is go to your salon and have them do a consultation, that way they can let you know what type of relaxer will work best with minimul damage.  I personally LOVE Bio-Ionics.  Ask your salon about this relaxer type.  It is amazing and doesn't damage at all!|`|GWCMQUnIaa	that **** hell fries your hair and it goes into the very core of your hair and it's not cool, just use a straightener, it may take time and effort but it is healthier in the long run|`|6f3f6d718fae9cac71e77cc6c1c1c47daa	i think it depends on your hair style.  if it's thin or thick    get one with a heat level..    and use hair heat protecter:)|`|sGvZLBjBaa	I was told that most Japanese hair products are strong on your hair. Many straighteners are rough on hair, burning the hair. Example,  the chi. I just bought a new straightener for Christmas with crystal in the plates, and it doesn't burnt the hair as much. The type of straightener does not affect whether or not your hair will be straight, the amount of hair you put in your straightener and the temperature affect it.  Hopes this helps :)|`|z5BrAz4Faa	Well I know a lot of people like the straight look I am a licensed hair dresser but I haven't worked for a while in that field, but I do know for a fact that if you lighten your hair its already probably a little dry and adding a lot of extra heat can be more damaging I suggest no matter what kind you decide to go with get a spray on heat protectant for your hair. Hair salons usually carry them if you ask or they even carry it at walmart. It will help protect your hair from heat when styling. I hope this was helpful.
IP8vzLuBaa	"A" is definately the best....don't like "B" at all - it looks like something an old man would wear.|`|b8QUR7Qzaa	A is way better|`|zOz3c5oMaa	deffffffff A!!!!! dont get B!!! it looks like something my grandma would wear!!|`|NqEw4skBaa	personaly i like the diamonds one|`|PsQFasl4aa	A is better.

6egxGam6aa	The best thing for your split ends is to cut them off. You probably don't want to do so because you like the length of your hair, but even a slight trim makes a huge difference. And if you don't like the thickness of your hair (you didn't mention it, but I thought I'd throw this in just in case), ask the stylist to thin it out a bit, too. Don't freak out if it seems like he or she is cutting off a lot of hair - there will be plenty left behind, trust me.    I would recommend John Frieda's FrizzEase for your frizz - you can find it at any drug store (or Walmart/Target) and it's under $10. Apply a small amount (maybe nickel sized, since your hair is long and thick) throughout your hair, and blow dry it.    One last suggestion - since your hair is very dry, try deep conditioning twice a week instead of just once.    Hope this helps, and good luck with your hair!|`|0lnamekJaa	YOU HAVE TO CUT OFF THE SPLIT ENDS.    P  e  r  i  o  d  .    That is the only way you can give your hair the chance to be healthy once again.    The split ends are not ABLE to repair themselves... Nothing you do can fix existing split ends.     I have really poofy hair and I found that if you use half conditioner or body lotion and half hair gel it keeps things smooth and healthy.    Also, only shampooing once every 2 to 3 days and using just conditioner the other days works wonders...|`|I9Fs952Waa	its  not  going to be under $10  but if you want your hair fixed then you will  buy it  it is Aveda products   go to there salon  and get  a hair cut  then they will  tell you what products to use  and then buy them    they have this hair serium and will tell you all about it   just say i am looking for a blue bottle serium, i need some frizzing control|`|GJVo7uWraa	i have thick frizzy hair i put a little body lotion BUT NOT AT THE ROOTS if you do your hair will look greasy (plus the lotion will make your hair smell good)|`|xQlCxeEWaa	I had the exactly same problem as you!    ok what you do is, don't wash your hair in hot water, only warm or a bit cooler when your done showering etc.    use deep moisture conditioners, more than 1ce a week if you feel like it    use a comb to comb your hair after you wash it and don't use a towel or force to dry it, but hairdryers are ok. Just make sure to comb it straight while your brushing it starting from your forehead than the sides of your hair.    I would also recommend garnier products they seem really good for me.|`|3FXd1MDsaa	you should use hair spray. i have that same problem sometimes and it is hard to solve or also get your hair cut thiner|`|4UrUzpAHaa	I know you said you don't want a cut, but I would seriously consider it.  Also ask the stylist to thin it, that will cut down om poofy-ness.  Try using a moisturizing shampoo especially for curly hair and use the Head and Shoulders every other day.  I love Garnier's Fortifying 3 Minute Deep Conditioner.  It works wonders.  Also, when you get out of the shower, scrunch some gel into it, to cut down of frizzyness, and hands off! Running your hands through it creates frizz.
C0HZ8ZB4aa	Sorry I don't, however I just wanted to comment on your femininity (sp??) point - I do agree that portraits, particularly dog portraits, are traditionally more masculine. However I think, if you have room on your back, if you positioned it central (either at the top, middle or bottom) on your back, it wouldn't look as masculine as it might to one side or on a limb. That's just my opinion, perhaps it's just my association, I link limb/shoulder dog portraits with men, whereas central I see as unisex. You could also ask your artist if he could find a subtle, non tacky way of incorporating a small floral design, perhaps a couple of black and white roses underneath, I don't know - I'm picturing it in my head and it looks nice but when I write it it probably sounds awful! See what she can come up with, but I wouldn't let the lack of femininity put you off getting such a meaningful (and no doubt beautiful) tattoo. Good luck with your choice!    Edit: These are nothing to do with me, but I was just having a browse of some dog portraits so sending you some links in case you've not seen them:    http://fc62.deviantart.com/fs8/i/2005/31...    http://fc43.deviantart.com/fs38/i/2008/3...

And to whoever gave me the thumbs down - she asked for an opinion and that was mine. I didn't say I thought it'd look bad on the side or on a limb, just that I understood her link with it being a masculine type of tattoo, which it *traditionally* is. Doesn't mean it's wrong for a woman to get it, but I was offering a suggestion on placement which, *in my opinion*, complemented the curves and shape of the female body better. I'm so sorry my opinion might differ to yours, oh pathetic one, but there is no right or wrong answer you know! :-)    *rant over*|`|JduQHocdaa	I don't have a pic,but my father got his german shepherd on his leg.

You're the only one who has to live with it, and if it has meaning and importance to you, that's all that should matter.  I say do it, you are thinking about it, and at this point, you probably already made up your mind.  Cold feet are normal, as is the thought of what others will think of your choice.  Good luck, and most importantly, enjoy it!|`|MV0lMuDMaa	Aw :( im so sad for you.  It will get better soon I promise :)    Anyway, I think I would get a portrait of my dog.

xoXkHOVsaa	Right after you get your eyebrows done they always look a little too "perfect" to be real.  In the next few days the hair will get a bit longer and they will look more natural.

7c6bf2a89333b3e48583a9b2b10a3231aa	I get where you're coming from and I'm aware that giving you a rude answer is pointless, but still.  You need to realize that you'll never have something that's yours, people will think similar to you always. Not only that, but you didn't create beads or a certain hair color. Whatever you saw or read that inspired you someone else has more than likely seen too.     If you stop striving to be so different and trying to have something that's YOURS, you'll find it. I know it's cliche to say 'just be yourself' but it's true. When you're shopping, don't buy something because it's cute and 'different', buy it just because it's cute.

Strawberries are def your choice if you like em....Also, your exfoliant is important....make sure you have a "buff puff" or product that is reusable, not an "applicant exfoliant." Lastly, too many products just clog the skin further which creates the bacteria an the results you are not wantin!! :) Good Luck:)|`|ByuR5vkLaa	looks like u have a little too much face washes going on.. i think maybe once in the morning of ur favorite wash and then at night the calmer or somewhat like that. I have tried what u did before like using a bunch of washes and thinking that it would clear my face but it only makes it worse usualy. Becuase when ur using so many products it will clog your pores and not give them any space for expholiating over a one day period. I suggest you talk to a dementologist or maybe someone suited for these questions like the convienent pharmacist at walgreens lol and they can maybe tell you some suggestions. hope i could help and good luck!
CLB32006aa	http://www.manentail.com/faqs.asp    They say it doesn't help hair grow faster, but that it makes hair stronger so it allows for maximum growth. (hair growth is stunted with split ends and damaged hair apparently)|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	no..it's actually too harsh for human hair..|`|0lnamekJaa	Nothing "Grows Your Hair".    Not shampoo...    Not supplements...    Your hair grows at a constant rate and the only thing that helps it be healthy is eating a healthy diet.    The rest are SCAMS.    Flat out SCAMS.     Don't fall for it.|`|o1wIz3VVaa	I used it as a teen... my hair grew very fast... also used the leave in conditioner...|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	No it does not.  No shampoo makes your hair grow faster.  Its genetics and your general health.  Eat right, take your vitamins, get plenty of sleep, shampoo your hair with gentle products and get regular trims.|`|P9HuD4Qgaa	hell no! Just a waste of money. products can strengthen your hair, to make it stronger, so it doesn't break off, and have an easier time growing out.|`|wQeCtj0uaa	thats what i heard|`|DGIUaDLYaa	No it only strenthes your hair to keep the ends from splitting so it seems like it grows faster.|`|w9Ydp6idaa	no it doesn't work well.|`|HN1zYwbFaa	I use it every now and again, i use the conditioner quite often. My father's side is Mexican and i get their hair, so my hair is thicker and coarser and can take the harshness. It depends on your hair type. Not sure about if it grows it though.|`|DLbracM5aa	Personally, Mane N Tail shampoo didn't make my hair grow...  but shampooing my hair and putting the products  shea butter, coconut oil, and Megatek did.|`|vSxhLvMVaa	No, that started as a joke actually. Terry Bradshaw said that one day on Fox NFL broadcast trying to see if he could get some for free from the company as well as to mess with Jimmy Kimmel, who used to do football picks on the show.    Look at the man. he is bald as can be. He just used it for his horses.|`|1899lYjMaa	No. Also no shampoo has any effect on your hair, at all (other than cleaning it, and removing the natural oils from it), due to the fact that in order for the ingredients to have an affect, you would have to keep the shampoo in your hair for 30 minutes or more, depending on the concentration of the active ingredients of the shampoo. Nothing makes your hair grow faster than a healthy diet. Also don't wash your hair more than twice a week. The oils that your head produces, are the best medicine for your hair, and washing it removes those oils. I recommend leave in conditioners with the specific attributes you are looking for, and never use anything made for animals, ever at all. these products can be dangerous for you.
Hx4AqA98aa	you cant.they dont let you order clothes from there website from the U.S|`|KFwXBXv7aa	You can't|`|craoWpkraa	unfortunately u can't. u have to go to the store.  go to forever 21, wet seal, or charlotte russe  here are some:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...
w6Hz3BKnaa	ok,  so first the better shape your hair is in, the faster it will grow.  Wash and condition your hair once a day or every other day depending on how oily your hair is.  Also comb your hair atleast once a day, because it seperates the dirt and makes it easier to grow, but it can't be wet. combing wet hair isn't good for it.  Massaging your scalp increases blood flow and stimulates growth.  Omega 3, 6 and 9 fish oil vitamins stimulate growth of hair, nails and keeps skin soft.   Alcohol and heat based styling products affect hair health and growth, so buy water based as much as possible.  Fruits, vegetables and exercise also stimulates hair growth.    The healthier you and your hair are, the faster it grows.|`|Q1uJmBesaa	nothing really increases growth, except for being healthy. eat right, and make sure your hair is in good condition. don't dye or apply heat to your hair often.|`|3Fwet0PVaa	Eat lots of fruits and veggies!  Massage scalp for 10 minz a day   and take hair vitamins!
S6WOighOaa	I also have long lashes, i use covergirl lash blast, and i always get compliments on them.     Covergirl just came out with lashblast-luxe which is the lash blast but it has different colors with a sparkle to it, and its in a pink bottle. Once my bottle runs out i cant wait to get some lash-lux!    i have blue eyes and blond hair also, to make my eyes pop, i sometimes take a greenish colored liquid eyeliner and put it right where my lid meets my lashes only on the outside edges about a quarter of the full lid. It always gets compliments!  or just a sparkled lid, light pink sparkles or shimmer looks good with blond hair and blue eyes!    Also Avon has reasonably priced good working, long lasting eyeliner. i suggest you use Avon that is what i use when i wear eyeliner.    hope this helped a bit!    God bless!|`|yop2DPYvaa	to be honest if u really want a dramatic lash wear flase ones. i wear them daily and if u buy natural looking ones they look natural can't go wrong! :)    liquid liner is best and it stays on throughout the day. if u rim the inside of ur eyes with black pencil its just a known fact that it doesnt last...if anything just reapply throughout the day. :)|`|ksZfTHyQaa	The mascaras that I've tried that have worked well on me are Benefit's BadGal Lash and Diorshow.

vkIkFgqiaa	I think you would def look better with curly or wavy hair. Some of the styles you chose were really short. They might look good on someone else, but not on other people. I think you wouldn't look the best with straight hair. You have good looks. Don't be bashful on religion, I know a lot of pretty girls with long hair. What's so bad with long hair, I like it!|`|buUTakKAaa	i like the avril lavigne haircut    or hairstyle  5 of the 6 under straight hair|`|vm5TgsQwaa	1st curly|`|h5cPbPj5aa	OHHH I LIKE THE PINK STREAK!!!!!|`|yenUJGsoaa	first one on the straight one and last one with curly|`|GYJSuTXIaa	The 5th one under straight.  That would look fantastic on you.  Good luck|`|Y9axRYkBaa	so, what's the question?|`|5Um59Muhaa	I like the 1st one in the straight hair, it is a more mature style, and the 2nd one is really cute (both are really good colors, but I think I like the darker color better.) and the 2nd curly one is really good, although I think I like darker colors on you better, and you will probably have to spend more time styling that hairstyle.  I hope I helped, and I hope you get a super cute hair cut!  :)  Best Wishes,  Crystal|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	i like the first one golden dark blonde its nice|`|3lALKwXfaa	i think u would look better w/ curly hair.|`|H4R2K8vxaa	You should do any of them.

73455c6a787c90036b88c6c36738f763aa	Dear Pinkrosy,     Here is my answer to your question:       "This natural process of graying hair can begin as early as your teens. In most people, however, graying first becomes noticeable in their late 30s.       Some researchers have shown that gender plays a role in graying hair. The average male starts to gray around age 30, while women typically began to notice lighter strands around age 35. "       The above 2 paragraphs I got from a medical document provided at source below. You can click and read the document to find out more information about the process of greying hair. I've found this document quite interesting to read.       Sincerely yours.|`|sNItD8ALaa	I started gettin it in my 30s...I actually haven't seen my natural color in a while...but every once in a while my roots will show...they're starting to look pretty silver up there...and my eyebrows are strating to sprout greys too...let me tell ya...they HURT to pluck out...jeesh...|`|EU7THzT7aa	Late 30s early 40s.|`|twVyisGnaa	30's or 40's.  Sometimes earlier if the person is always angry or stressed.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	I have 5 brothers  they were all great at 30  2 were bald at 35 (they used the cinnamon bun swirl) to cover the shine! LOL  I have some gray @ 50, and still have 90% of my hair!  they are very jealous!  I enjoy this fact to the extreme!  ROFL|`|AA10166421	normally late 40s.|`|MksOlZaVaa	I'm 14 and have found a few.    Must be hereditary or something..
YbO7D6axaa	Use Maybelline Mineral Power Liquid Concealer. I swear by that stuff. I put it on my blemishes and they pretty much disappear. :D|`|c57371c41551234130f1f0763eeace8caa	Maybelline Mineral Power is pretty good.  Medium coverage.  Lasts 6-8 hrs .  Doesn't cause breakouts. :)  Doesn't do much minerally, but it's okay.  About $8 or $9.  EDIT: And I didn't see the answerer above me until after I posted this. :)
fYox2mwGaa	I like to use cheaper brands of eyeliner.  I like Jane's twistable pencil in grey.  It goes on super smooth and lasts a long time.  I also use a soft kohl pencil made by Wet N Wild or NYC.  I have found that cheaper brands work just as well as the more expensive brands.    My all time favorite mascara is Maybelline's Full N Soft in black.  It goes on smooth, even if you put on several coats.  It won't make your eyelashes hard and stiff.  I really like that it stays put so at the end of the day I'm not wiping off little black flakes off of my cheeks.      I like to use the MakeUpAlley website.  I discovered it a few weeks ago while reading an answer on yahoo answers and I've been using it almost daily ever since.  I've found that it really does help you research for the best products since there are tons of reviews.      Good luck :)|`|F0TrTxataa	eyeliner i wear expresso its like a dark brown color its by annabelle    mascara - i just use mabaline(i think i spelt that wrong) black|`|9e7LvvhAaa	Eyeliner: I prefer liquid liner. Dont try cover girl lineexact it drys out. Try the ones not in like the marker ( the best way I can describe it) shape they could dry out. The ones in the small container thingy work best. The reason I dont like the ones in pencil Forum is because they are harder to put on ( for me anyways) and are sometimes sharp or hard and hurt.    Mascara: I love cover girl lashblast its great! Macs zoomlash dosent give me the volume I want. Great Lash clumps like crazy.|`|YbO7D6axaa	I use Avon Glimmersticks in Blackest Black for my eyeliner, have been for years. It's an amazing product. And for mascara, I use Covergirl Exact Eyelights. They come in colors made specifically for each eye color. I have green eyes so I use Black Ruby but there's Black Gold for hazel, Black Pearl for brown, and Black Sapphire for blue. :)|`|ksZfTHyQaa	Eyeliner: If I'm going out MAC Fluidline in Blacktrack, though I'm really liking their new Pen Ultimate Eyeliner. For everyday I use MAC Engraved Powerpoint.     Mascara: I like BadGal Lash by Benefit

MksOlZaVaa	Like other people have said, try getting your hair cut with layers and bangs! They look good on everybody!  You could get some of those glasses with the square frames and thicker arms. (They seem to be a very popular style)  Buy that polish that you put on and when you go to bite your nails it tastes reaaally bad. Or just get them painted really pretty so you won't want to wreck them by biting.  Try adding accessories to your everyday outfit.    Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time.|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	Cut your hair and get side bangs and long layers and maybe dye it a richer brown   Convince your parents that your confidence would go up with contacts. If not, go some cute frames!  I recentaly stopped bitting my nails. Get a manicure done once in a while so you will not want to bite them with pretty polish on them! You just kind of need to force your self not to. Paint your nails more often  Gets some more fashion tops like from forever21  As for makeup, I wish you told us your skin and eye color.  Do dark brown or black eyeliner but don't cake it on. Add a lot of black mascara to make your lashes long and maybe a nude slightly shimmery eyeshadow. too much eyeshadow and glasses don't mix.|`|iEjCmMMPaa	Cut your hair short! we not exactly short, but like shoulder length and layerrss! It will change your look soo much and you can help cancer patients by donating the hair you cut off!    also try highlights, or ifyou don't want to pay for highlights buy some sun-in and create your own highlights|`|txDbluVwaa	www.polyvore.com     THAT IS GOD!

KDmJXCjtaa	Hey Alexissssss  Here's my makeup Routine: Foundation, makes your skin smooth. Concealer, on the front bone of your nose, that little crease above your lips and the little spot on your chin, and under your eyes. This makes your face standout sorta.  Then a light brown eyeshadow on the lid of your eye. An off whitish color on your brow bone. To highlight your eyes. Then if you have eyeliner, line the bottom lid with the pencil as close as the roots of your eyelashes as you can get. Try not to go in too far though. Then do the top if you want, I usually do, it makes your eyes looks bigger. Close one eye and stretch it alittle and draw small dashes really close to the roots of your top eyelids eyelashes. Don't make the line go all the way though make it go halfway. Then mascara, I usually do the top and lightly coat the bottom.   ----  Nails: Kims nails are super short, heres what I do to hers, I file them so there straight across, paint them a peach color and a white tip. They look alittle longer that way. Keep filing them, not like 24/7 but just kinda alot, it makes your nails stronger.  ----  Eyebrows: Get the tweezers. I use my moms hah. But all you do is tweeze the hairs that are like under the bridge of your eyebrow. Don't ever tweeze your eyebrow just around it. Make sure to tweeze like wear it gets a unibrow hah because no one wants that.  ---  And for your weight, If you go on this site, http://www.jennycraig.com/etools/yoursty...

6ybAFZuAaa	2 cups sugar   1/4 cup lemon or lime juice (vinegar may also work, although I haven't tested it)   1/4 cup water       Combine all ingredients and bring just to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often. Reduce heat and simmer for about 25 minutes until mixture has turned a rich amber color.     Lift the saucepan off the heat occasionally so that the bubbles will calm down and you can keep an eye on the color. It gives off a nice cooked lemon sort of aroma when it's finished.     Move off the heat and allow the mixture to partially cool in the pot until it begins to thicken (about 15 minutes).        It's important that the mixture is heated long enough. Otherwise you'll have problems with the final product being too sticky and not solidifying enough to use.     Pour the mixture into an air-tight container and allow to cool fully before handling. There you go! You just made your own, at home, quick and easy hair removal potion!       Sugaring Hair Removal Application   Use it Cold!   Once completely cooled, this sugaring paste can be applied directly onto the hair and pulled off. Just grab a big chunk out of the container (put a bit of muscle into it to get it out).     The sugaring paste can be warmed and used with muslin strips, just like wax, if you prefer. I like the simplicity of using it cold. There's no muss, no fuss... and that suits me just fine.        How Much?   If you're doing your legs, or another large surface area (i.e., back, chest), use a bigger piece of the sugaring paste. It works well to use half of your mixture at a time, then one half can cool off (from the heat of your hands) while you continue to work with the other half.     Smaller pieces can be used on eyebrows, facial hair, bikini line, etc.     The paste will adhere best to hair that is at least 1/4 inch long, so you may want to grow it out just a bit (if you can stand it) for best results. Hair that is longer than an inch should be trimmed down a bit.        Prepare Your Paste   Flatten the paste out in your hands. Try not to work with it too much as it'll get sticky from the heat of your hands. Press the paste firmly onto an area you want to remove hair from.     Make sure that your piece of sugaring paste stays at least 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick so that it'll pull off easily.     When you've got it flattened and pressed into the skin, flick up the end of your piece to remove enough to be able to grab it. Pull the skin taut and yank the sugaring paste off quickly in the opposite direction of the hair growth.             Fold the piece in half until it's the size you need it for the next area and press it on again. Repeat until the piece becomes too sticky to work with from the heat of your skin. Then discard that piece and grab another and continue if necessary.     When you're finished in an area, simply wipe it down with a warm, wet washcloth. The sugaring paste is water soluble, so it cleans up quick and easy.       I hope I helped! I use this all the time!|`|BE12KJZ3aa	did you see that on The Doctors?

ATqWlp8aaa	It really depends on your eye color. I recommend Almay. They put out a make up line particularly catered to enhancing your eye color. Black mascara usually works for every eye color though|`|0fTAWpsXaa	2 words, big lashes!!!!|`|d107a66f105e195f090c296ea6ac5b01aa	It all depends on your eye color; but if you simply want to just make your eyes appear larger, then try lining your bottom water line with white eyeliner.  As for making it pop out, you want to try and find the contrasting color of your eye color. For example, if you have green eyes, black would work extremely well for making your eyes stand out.   Also, you can add lengthening mascara which makes your eyes stand out.    EDIT    Well the contrasting color for brown eyes is purple. So you can try wearing purple eyeshadow, but there isn't much you can do without eyeliner since that is the main product to bring out your eyes. Just apply purple (dark) eyeshadow in the balls of your eye and then you should be set. Then some clear lengthening mascara.|`|iZfMubtNaa	Go Natural... Guys like me like less makeup

You won't get alot of muscles from that but you will improve your cardio and lose weight.    If you dont want to do any exercising, dont go on a full diet because you are not overweight. The best thing you can do is cut back on grain products such as bread, pasta, noodles, etc. Also, don't have creamy sauces on food because they have alot of carbs than tomato sauce.

Just because you're getting healthy doesn't mean you can't snack. In fact, eating small meals and snacks throughout the day, or grazing, has been shown to aid weight loss, (compared to eating three large meals a day), by keeping metabolism steadier. Pick snacks that are low in calories and fat and high in fiber (dried apricots, nuts, rice cakes, fruits, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, and so on). Vegetables are generally very low in calories, very high in fiber, and full of flavor and nutrition. Generally, you want to - with a combination of calorie reduction and increased activity - reduce and burn a certain number of calories a day, causing a net loss of calories so your body is forced to use its own stores of fat.

qXu6p7C0aa	LMFAOOOOOOOO!  omg! your right, it bugs me how girls put  on so much cover up they look funny.  "you look like cakes"  lol nice. but I agree just put on a little as much  to cover up the acne not to make cluncks of make up|`|csyukwfQaa	Well how do you put it on properly?  Some people cannot help acne.|`|lzYRDU1aaa	Ya, I agree with you.    But it's not their fault they pick the wrong makeup. If they have acne, they want to cover it, how are they supposed to know the RIGHT foundations??    and maybe they can't tan, and think they'd look better tan. Think about it, I don't think they all try to look cakey...|`|TrPySdXFaa	DAMN ***** IS NOT EVEN UR BUSINESS   HOW OTHER GIRLS LOOK MAYBE UR JEALOUS|`|MkyiYw1faa	I agree completely. i have seen so  many girls that are in the 10-12 category that look like they were standing by the side of the road when a car drove through a mud puddle on their way to school.

Dont know the situation ask, help if you can, but dont insult|`|ysv6OHCHaa	i agree.. if they really wanna look like they dont have acne.. use a pimple treatment! and apply makeup in the natural sunlight so they see what the rest of the world sees! an orange, fake, smeared icing on a cake looking face!  if you want a tan.. makeup is not the way! there are tanning moisturisers for the face!  another thing make sure you choose makeup that is correct for your skintone, apply it not only on the face but a bit on the neck, dont use to much and BLEND IT IN!|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	I completely agree with you. I used to know a girl who would come to school with her foundation not blended properly (not even the right colour for her skin tone!), and have a thick orange line around her jaw line and chin from it.    Then people who use liquid foundations and it goes all gooey and cakey. Even worse.    If people use foundation, it should be because they need it to cover up blemishes or pimples (ones that you can see without a microscope), to make their skin look softer. Or, on special occasions where make up is necessary.    I think you've got the right amount of make up on, and you've got it blended properly when people can't even tell that it's not your natural skin.    But, make up should never be so visible that people could scrape an inch of it off your face.    :)

Everyone's healing times differ. Some people can take out their piercing's jewelry for hours (or much longer!) and put them in again just fine, while others can't have them out long at all. I would suggest putting something in the hole to keep it from closing up (I have two monroes, so I know how they are). It might not be very sanitary but as long as they are healed, your risk for infection probably won't be too great. I suggest even filling the hole with a toothpick until you can get new jewelry. After you get your new jewelry in, make sure to have some extras laying around in case!
YbO7D6axaa	Like you said, sleep is the key. Get about 8 hours and find a way to sleep soundly through the night, not tossing and turning. If you still have dark circles/puffiness, take two cold spoons (leave them in the freezer overnight) and place them on the puffy area. If that doesn't help, turn to makeup. Find a concealer or foundation that's got high coverage and low-transparency. I'd say go with Covergirl TruBlend. If none of that works, then there's really nothing else you can do. Dark circles are usually from sunken/thin skin around the eyes and/or the lighting where you are. But puffiness is usually from stress or sleep-deprivation. So go to bed. LOL. :)|`|9e7LvvhAaa	It is perfectly normal to have dark circles at any age dont feel like you are the only one! 8 hours of sleep is not the best for you try 9 or 10 you will probably see a difference I know that some company sells a drugstore eye puffiness reducer its green and has like a roley ball at the top check it out I hear its great or just concealer

fpv8IV3Haa	what matters is what the ingredients are. if you want a safer shampoo look for natural shampoo that have no chemicals in them, but they might be a little more expensive.|`|7nGwou8uaa	it depends what the ingredients are.|`|yZX1wpUJaa	well not really. It may depend on how harsh the shampoo ingriedients are. Basically if one has 30 and the other has 15 but the 15 one has poison in it to make your hair nice and shiny, odviously it'snot the safeest one.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Not necessarily.  It depends on what they are.  Most shampoos are pretty safe, but if you're worried, try something with more NATURAL ingredients.|`|1QpigqCNaa	not really unless it has more fragrance then it could irritate your scalp|`|7h0qfos1aa	It depends on what those ingredients are. The shampoo with 15 ingredients could have one ingredient that is a harsher chemical than the 30 ingredients in the other brand. My suggestion is to read the ingredient list and look for things that you recognise. If there's a chemical in there that sounds weird, don't buy it. I buy my shampoo from my salon - it's imported from Italy called Davines http://www.davines.com/ it's expensive but makes your hair look really lovely, Jennifer Aniston uses it. The brand uses all natural ingredients and tries to be environmentally sustainable|`|NBT5PoRVaa	just use the freakin shampoo. you know they are tested on animals so they are safe for us.|`|kvJwoQmOaa	better living through chemicals enjoy a nice head of hair and then cancer...........|`|45u7BzCUaa	The one's without the toxic ingredients, no matter how many mixed to make a concoction of shampooists.|`|AA12351099	If they were not safe then they wouldn't be sold..... hopefully.    Just make sure they are not from China and your set ;)|`|vRup0n7Oaa	well sometimes. It depends but im pretty sure your safe|`|1u5beEnjaa	It really depends on the ingredients it has. Try looking for one with less preservatives and more organic material.
6jXuUCdraa	yeah, concelear is for under eye circles and pimples, because its heavier. foundation is for an over all even complextion and skin tone. so, if you had dark cicles under your eyes, you should have got some concelear as well.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	it might not give enough coverage but i don't use concealer before or with my foundation..|`|x3NIn6rSaa	oh yeah  its much stronger  covers it right up|`|MbFS6XFQaa	it's not bad, it just doesn't cover things as well as consealer|`|ezoKuZLgaa	Sure as long as you rub it in well and make sure the skin tones match with each other and your skin.    I recommend using a sponge pad.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Um well I've never used concealer in my life and I sometimes wear foundation... and nothing bad has happened to me haha
B29boGPcaa	get rimmel london eye magnifying mascara in brown :) x|`|vsjCVgtjaa	get clear mascara or brown|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Wear a brown mascara.   Revlon sells a 'beyond natural' mascara.

Also you can get the bare minerals kit and that is really a natural look, but it make your skin alll clear in all. Also don't rush to wear makeup, enjoy your childhood. :)|`|R2epUOTMaa	Go with clear or brown mascara. Or maybe just curl your eyelashes instead?

N3asaDRaaa	Clearasil acne scrub works wonders, and its cheap, and available right off the shelf of your local supermarket :-) (I'm 15 too, and i HAD acne on my forehead. Wash your face everyday too... that helps!!|`|IcTnDRC4aa	For face washes, use Dove. Since it has the simplest ingredients, it is the best for your skin. It comes in bars of soap, liquid pumps, and towels. Just Neutrogena for your moisturizer. Make sure to get one with SPF in it.|`|RGSSYFPyaa	use dove soap, to wash your face.  Try Spectro Face wash  and aveno Mostiorzer.    ahaha lmaoo at my speelling.   :)|`|pFmtHEv4aa	proactive! its sooo good!|`|7tnb4On2aa	At 15 with bad acne?    I really recommend that you go to a derm and get a prescription for tretinoin.   This will not only clear up the acne in about 3 months, it will prevent future scarring by thinning the top layer of skin so the papules and pustules can get through to the surface.      In my time, we had no such product available to my generation.  Basically, almost every teenager had acne and it's residual scars, for life.      You were born at a time, when acne is not only highly treatable, but can spare you of it's terrible aftermath, scarring.    Love yourself enough to go to a derma and get a prescription for tretinoin, and stick with it, because of it's purging effect, your skin will get better before it gets worse.   But one day, you'll wake up with smooth, clear skin.  I've seen this stuff perform miracles on people with the most severe acne.   One of my neighbours had such a horrid complexion, and got a prescription, and then she moved.   I saw her a year later, and she was literally glowing.
xlqeCvxnaa	The longer the better, I say. At least waist length, preferably longer. Men in general like long hair as an evolutionary trait as well kept long hair shows that female is healthy and takes care of herself.|`|piX47TA6aa	Hey girlie,    I dont know about your man but i love ladies with long hair! the longer the better! its fun to play with when your cuddling and its something to hold (or pull on) in the bedroom. ;0)|`|7DJkwzKDaa	i think it depends to themm.  & if it looks good on you.|`|PNIihEDXaa	okay im a chicka and you probs dont want to hear my opinion BUT i onestly think short hair makes a girl look like a lesbo.like agnyess deynes|`|tkD9Ac6haa	usually depends on how it looks, but i think long looks best on most girls    plus i don't see much short hair on girls or i dont ussally see girls that have long hair and cut it short....or have it short and grow it long...|`|3SMvCETmaa	I am not a guy.. But I can tell you it depends on the man.. Some men do like long hair some dont care and some like it short. all are different..|`|YLY0HztSaa	im not a guy but i heard that they think they look sexier with long hair.
v0fooLeTaa	If the purple is a darker tone then yes, if no the burgundy or perhaps a black scarf would look better.|`|nYi7UJaxaa	Oh my gosh! I love the gold top and black leggings.I really hate purple and I think a burgundy scarf would look so wonderful!!!|`|88wRUPytaa	I would wear the gold, black leggings and some cute black flats and a black clutch!

3UaRXGWoaa	Pantene straightening leave-in conditioner|`|hLohtlPEaa	Biosilk shine on spray. It's a little pricy, but it works well. I spray each section B 4  I use the flatiron.|`|d6EDZqpeaa	garnier sleek and shine stay in conditioner|`|zPA0kiZNaa	First off, do you have a good straightener? I recommend a ceramic, they're the best. This can help make it sleeker. If it is still puffy/frizzy after you've styled it, I recommend a product like frizz-eaze. Just look for a bottle that is labeled as a finishing cream.  They will make your hair less dry and puffy.:)

lIpjuMTHaa	none. you shouldnt be thinking about that yet. make that decision when you turn 18. plus tattoos are about expression or passion and if you have to ask someone else what to get that means you arent ready for one and you just want one to be "cool."|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay 'bby.girl', I'll be 'orginal'.....    1. Somebody who needs to come on the internet and ask strangers for tattoo ideas, is a long way off being ready for a tattoo.    2. Somebody aged 16 is at least 2 years off being ready for a tattoo.      I'm sorry but you're underage, you have no imagination, and you can't even master basic grammar, did you really expect me to take you seriously?      Edit: To 'britney' below -  1. Many areas of the world you cannot get a tattoo underage with or without parental consent.  2. Real intelligent idea, advising a young girl to get a tattoo on the area of her body which stretches the most, both through natural weight fluctuation not to mention what will happen to it if she has children. Do you have a brain?      Scarlett - if she lives in a place where tattoos are illegal below the age of 18, then I have every right to advise her not to do it, as does anybody else! You wouldn't stand and watch someone break the law in the street without doing anything would you? (well, perhaps YOU would). Laws like this are there for a reason - to protect kids - but unfortunately evolution has not caught up with us yet in order to get rid of this silly little idea that most 16 year olds have that they 'know everything'. You should know better.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	None.  You're too young to get a tattoo.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	If you need ideas, you're not ready for a tattoo.|`|JduQHocdaa	Nothing think of something up on your own.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	I hate to say this but wait till you are 18.  I know when I was 16 I wanted a tattoo but if I would have gotten some of the stuff I wanted tattooed on I would be so embarassed now.  It will be all the more special when you get it as soon as you are 18.|`|I44n8Eb1aa	none.  UNLESS it is an attribute to a lost love one, its small, or it seriously means something to you and you have been considering it for a VERY long time.    wait til you are eighteen, and/or get something you love and want, not something someone suggested on the internet.|`|jyi4OZi1aa	Here's an idea, don't get a tattoo until you are at least 18.   I would suggest to get something that you are interested in or symbolic to something in your life, but your life and interests are going to change severly in the new few years.   Sorry, I just don't think you should get a tattoo at such a young age.|`|CIlwfiU3aa	ummm a tattoo last far longer than being 16 so why would I tell you a tattoo that is geared towards a 16 year old? Also isnt it illegal to get a tattoo at 16..     Put more thought into it.. i have a horrible tattoo that I got illegally and eventhough Id still like it if it came out halfway decent.. it didnt because no respectable, reputable tattoo artist would tattoo anyone under 18      Notorious D.... good advice..   And what you say about making parents look bad is a very good and true point.... I wish i wouldve thought about that before mine! You sound very mature for your age!Good job..    Ive wanted my tattoos for years and will be going in and getting my "first" (my first good and legal one) here in a few weeks...They are deff worth the wait..|`|bxbFkVhzaa	Hi hun-  make sure you dont get in in a place that will effect your education and future jobs... its really something that should be considered.  I would avoid arms/legs or any visable area to the public, make it in a more remote place so that its more mysterious!  You do have to be 18 to get a tattoo though, unless you have an adult with you! :)     heres what i think would be cuteee...     http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04...    *(make the wording or symbol of some meaning to you)*    good luck and think it out thoroughly first!|`|S16Ge7mUaa	ahah, i'm 15 and i'll be original.    look don't get nothing now.  If you really have a passion for something you  like, then get that.

I want a flying bird on my wrist. and i want angel wings, what else? i want a rose that my mom has on her back... a red rose. pretty neat. and behind my ear/neck i want a scorpion/snake or something. idk and an anchor..|`|EnAtAmHoaa	those people cannot tell you what to do with your body only your parents can and if they are allowing you to get a tattoo they have no right to tell you you shouldn't. but if you are not sure about what you want don't get one now, wait until you are sure. i personally would want a tattoo to mean something and be personal and original, and people on yahoo answers don't know you or your personality, therefore will be little help. do more thinking and make a list of things that really mean something to you and what defines who you are and makes you you, ie hobbies, sports, mottos you live by, religion, people/experiences that have had an impact on you, symbols of something you believe firmly in. then ask your friends what they think makes you unique and what would represent you well.

YbO7D6axaa	I'd go with the Platinum for brown eyes to help them pop. The Cabernet is a more purple-y color and the Royale is more of a Navy blue. The Emerald is a darker shade than the Platinum and it's more of a green-eyed product. So I'd definitely say the Platinum is best. :)|`|x6eq1XRvaa	ooh id go with black Cabernet
YbO7D6axaa	Either the Forest or the Black would be best to bring out the green in your eyes. I would have gone with the plum because purple bring green eyes out amazingly but if it's more brown than plum, don't go with it. Forest will give your green eyes more pop because it's also green and if you really want your eyes to stand out, wear a green shirt too. The black would be more for an everyday sort of thing because it'll look good with anything you put on. :)|`|VitK0Wenaa	charcoal    It's neutral, but not too harsh.|`|xJfVrAD7aa	Forest, Bronze, or Dark Brown|`|cy8VEbuCaa	the plum or bronze  those would bring out your eyes|`|7mmmGytpaa	i would think dark brown or a dark green, blue would probably look good too :)|`|eIVzv4uMaa	Charcoal, deep bronze, forest, & dark brown would be best.|`|Mz2JmNCcaa	I guess it depends what you're wearing, and what's the occasion. I personally think since you have pale skin, you should use the black and charcoal to create the kind of smokey eyes look which would make your green eyes stand out a lot. Pretty. :)|`|gmeQLvJ7aa	It really depends on the occasion, if your going to school or work then Charcoal would be probably be best if you're going out then the Deep Bronze would be better.

BVJBY4eQaa	Suede is the reverse of any leather or sometimes a split leather.      Alcantara is a fabric made to look and feel like suede or nubuck. It should be cleaned carefully as oversoaking with water or using solvents will cause delamination and the fabric will be ruined.|`|Uqir6wYUaa	right. Alcantara is a synthetic fabric, that just feels and looks like suede, but can be washed in cold water.
0JcJedLcaa	i say rhinestones  -cheaper  -bling!  -cute  -can change the way theyre arranged  -there fun!  :)|`|FMcu6BNpaa	Use the rhinestones   1. They cost less  2.The are super shiny  3. Whenever people see them they will think "~bLiNg-BLiNg~"|`|1W8eBca9aa	I would go with the rhinestones for two reasons:    1. they're cheaper, obviously :]  2. you can change up the designs with the rhinestones more easily than you can if you just have it customized.|`|zOz3c5oMaa	well if you really love it and care about it that much 20$ isnt all that much so i would get the pink rhinestones.|`|vT4l2caVaa	I love rhinestones and they cost less but they fall off easily. I really like solid colors and patterns too.....there's always a reason that anything costs more|`|jIFLmzY5aa	i would go with the customized sidekick because even-though it cost more, it would last longer and another plus... everybody has rhinestones, so no one will have the same as you.

1o6bzLVbaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPCFN3JBE...  video tutorial!|`|egLhVY35aa	i have curly hair but it is very fizzy so i use foxy curls by bed head.  it relaxes the frizz and the curls.  the scrunching method works great with foxy curls.  you can find it at most drug stores.  it costs around $15 to $16.  also if you find that makes your hair look hard and messy looking, try a large curler found at most drugstore also.  these help refine the waves.  hope this helps a little!|`|Wvyzzwriaa	SCRUNCHING WILL NOT WORK ON YOU!!  it will only leave your hair hard and nappy lookin.  you should get one of those really fat curlers(u can find it at target) theres diffrent sizes for if you want curls or waves|`|p1whoIiDaa	If you have enough money you could go for extensions(I had them for half a year).    Do you know a shampoo called Dove Therapy? After using that shampoo for almost a week, I tied my hair into a really tight bun and just taking it out after wards (in the morning) and my hair was wavy. Dove shampoo made my hair stronger, so the waves kind of stayed for the whole day until I washed it. But that's just me...it's just a regular shampoo and I think its only $6.|`|ywl35HeEaa	beach waves are what you want. you could try leave-in curl enhancing conditioner after your shower. scrunch it in your hair for a long time and spray it with moose so the waves stay. tif this doesn't work, put some product in it, and wrap it in a towel or stuff it in a shower cap, and sleep on it. when you wake up, you should have waves. hope i helped! bye!  you could also try a curling iron and just not use it for 30 seconds... just more like 10 seconds... like leave it on for only 10 seconds and the curls won't be that dramatic. they will turn into curl/waves like celebrities' hair.|`|nOMWG8SMaa	Wrapping small pieces of hair around a thin curling iron is what gives you the goldie locks look.     What these girls are using are probably large barrel curling irons, or just hair curlers.       curlers like these:  http://remington.factoryoutletstore.com/...  or a curling iron like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Tools-Supertoo...      Adding a curl serum or lotion will keep them in place.  Try something like this Paul Mitchel curl definer:  http://www.goddess-within.com/pamirotrcu...      Good luck!
0jQcNWITaa	I love to belly dance.  I did not take my first class until I was 52. And I am on my second total hip replacement and still managed to do most everything with the class. I have had 3 semesters of it now.  Was able to get wonderful cheap clothes and veils on ebay. Live in a little rv so hard to practice, but  I do what I can. Belly dancing is the most fun exercise I have ever done - if I can do it so can you.   Good luck - hope you have a great time.|`|jYBgBcZGaa	Why don't you try it and find out? It obviously depends what you find enjoyable. If you are asking for a bellydancer's opinion they will probably tell you it's amazing|`|2d2bdc6f795760894eae430a43793ff9aa	Congratulations lass. Speaking as the husband of a belly dancer, I can tell you, it is not hard to learn, it is very low impact ( aerobically speaking), but as to what it is like, I'm unable to answer. That is something that must be addressed first hand. Yes, but not based on what you've seen in movies and magazines. There are different styles of belly dancing, and each tries to convey a different social state(?). I might suggest first, listening to the varieties of music associated with belly dancing. The rest is up to you. Above all, have fun. Good luck lass.
kmUNTUP5aa	Well i'm 12 n a dancer n in gymnasts. I would not wear a thong but i had da same problem. I twisted my underwear anf that worked. Keep on rockin!

t4cJy368aa	Use a straightening shampoo, I prefer John Frieda, its cheap and you can find it at any drug store.   Section your hair and blow dry your hair. Use a comb to blow dry with your hair to make it straight.   Use a straightening serum, then flat iron.|`|y3FPtEZ6aa	tease it and then straighten it cuz ur gonna have to any ways|`|CZfUO2kcaa	Go to a great stylist. Get a relaxing treatment. My cousins had very curly blond hair which took forever to straighten. Their mom took them to get their hair relaxed, the opposite of getting a perm, and it took enough of the wave out so that they could get their hair to go straight with a regular flat iron, but remain wavy if they don't want it stick straight. The treatment lasts about 2 years, though it does depend on how fast your hair grows.    This is not something that you want to be doing at home with an over the counter product. You could completely ruin your hair by burning or chemically frying it. Then you'd have to cut it all off and start over.    Good Luck!|`|10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	Honestly, if your hair is THAT curly, it might be VERY difficult to make it look like that.  I have VERY curly hair too, and I straightened it for years.  I have even tried chemically relaxing it, but even that didn't do the trick.  I have just learned to work WITH my hair, instead of AGAINST it.|`|Q5gvGAvZaa	get your hair layered. like one short layer and then one medium layer and a long layer. it'll make it thinner and easier to straighten, plus that's what the girl in the pic has. then when ur straightening put two layers up and straighten one at a time. that will cut the time and make it gorgeous!
LNFsii3Haa	dirty blonde hair that seemed to have a few strands in front highlighted naturally by the sun... long hair for a guy in the traditional sense, but so sexy... swept in front of his eyes, still showing his beautiful eyes and giving him a little mystery and boyish charm.     think of a vampire novel and how they describe the hair on the sexy vampires in the civil war era...|`|JGoJCgjhaa	Just say that the person's hair looked like Leonardo di Caprio's hair in Titanic and voila|`|wy5SiCS2aa	sexy!

Basically, just tell her that you want to always look your best and ask her advice.    Just say "mom, I am growing up and I want to make sure I look good, especially when I go to parties and stuff. "    Then when you start talking ask her if maybe a little powder or lipstick would be OK, since it is a special occasion.     If you are under 12, you may not get a good reaction, because girls that young are naturally pretty. But it can't hurt to ask. Also, you need to know what her rules are. So ask her when she thinks it will be ok to wear makeup, or how about perfume. Just tell her you want to know when you can do things.|`|HruFlddnaa	Try to make her remember her childhood.

Revlon is cheaper, but Garnier Fructis keeps the red hair vibrant and prevents it from fading as much.  Also, between touchups, use John Freida LuminousColor Glaze in whatever shade of red that matches your haircolor the best.  Also, use John Freida Vibrant Red Shampoo & Conditioner.  All of these products should be found in your local drugstore, Walmart, Target, etc.  They're also available at www.drugstore.com.|`|st5reHVjaa	im thinking that yes it could damage ur hair a LOT  so if u do it urself, try on one strand of hair (root to tip)  cause ur hair could fall out....    and there's no really vibrant not fading red that comes out of a box.  u'd have to go to a salon|`|y3FPtEZ6aa	that hair color is so cute you should get it|`|VJFegqWmaa	maybe red streaks but not compelety red hair|`|sIEwJ1pjaa	Don't dye it that color.

Without knowing more about your sister I can't recommend colors but check out Almay products, they make colors for each eye color to make her eyes pop and they aren't weird colors. Almay's website has a tips and technique's part to it so check that out.   If you have more to spend try Bare Escentuals make-up. Since it is a mineral powder make-up it's very easy to apply and looks natural. The foundation is like $25 dollars but it will last 4-6 months.
EL45UeUJaa	Yeah I am also part of my school's drama club, and we actually have our own makeup there at the school that we use for theatre.  But if your schools drama theatre group doesn't provide that then...pretty much anything that is creamy or Liquid, kind of thick, and maybe go a tone a little darker than your natural skin color should work :) (Be sure to add blush on top so you dont look dead, unless of course that is your character haha) Also make sure to wear eyeliner so that your eyes are more defined on stage.|`|lAn6ih0Qaa	eyeliner and mabey a light blue or pink or brown eye shadow.|`|IO5NDDzJaa	Wear a light foundation to even out your skin tone and add powder over it to set your makeup.

Try a light brown shimmery eyeshadow all over your lids. Then wear black eyeliner and mascara. And for the lips a peachy pink gloss or lipstick would look really nice.

If you have badly split ends, an inch or two may need to be removed, but it is healthier for your hair in the long run. Remember, trim only for split ends-- otherwise have 1/8 inch trimmed every 8 to 12 weeks: hair grows just one half inch per month and if it is cut more frequently, you will not see any length, since it is being cut as often or more than it is growing.   2. Wash hair as needed depending on your hair type and health. This could be every three days with products that do not contain alcohol or harsh sulfates and are pH balanced. Do not over-wash (once is usually enough), as over washing can cause a dry condition, which will ultimately lead to breakage. While washing, massage your scalp. This will reawaken sleeping follicles and promote thicker healthier hair.   3. Use a regular moisturizing conditioner after every wash, but deep condition at least every week. One week use a moisturizing deep conditioner. The next use a protein or reconstructing conditioner. Doing so will make your hair healthy and strong.   4. Use a daily moisturizer or leave-in conditioner as black hair is prone to dryness. Apply the moisturizer (without petroleum jelly, petrolatum or mineral oil) to the hair from roots to ends and gently massage in. Do this daily or as your hair requires--you want your hair to feel soft and pliable.You may have to experiment with what works for you but Ultra Black Hair Creme Moisturizer, Doctor Miracles, ORS Carrot Oil Cream or Dudley's PCA Moisture Retainer are good moisturizers to try.   5. A light oil (olive, soybean)applied sparingly may be used on your hair after applying a water-based moisturizer in order to seal moisture into the hair shaft and give your hair a nice natural shine. These oils can also be used to relieve a dry scalp.   6. Avoid using blow-dryers as much as possible when drying hair as the excessive heat causes dryness, damage and breakage. Air drying hair is the best method. If the volume of your hair is increased with air drying you can do one of two things: first: apply moisturizer,then air-dry-- this will decrease the volume without causing damage; or second - apply moisturizer and use a dome or bonnet dryer on a cool or warm setting. Never use the highest setting!   7. To get your hair to grow long, you also need to comb it carefully. Be sure to use a wide-tooth comb with no seams and comb it gently from the ends first, as combing from the ends will detangle hair as you comb higher and higher. Never comb from the roots to the ends until your hair is completely untangled.   8. Avoid daily and/or excessive brushing of your hair, as black hair is fragile. Excessive brushing can strip the hair of its protective layers. If you trying to smooth your hairline, brush gently, use a soft boar bristle brush, and make sure your hair is completely dry and moisturized.   9. Make sure you also wrap your hair with a silk/satin head wrap or bonnet before you go to bed at night. Without this protection, your loose hair will move about as you sleep putting stress on your hair, drying it out, and causing split ends.   10. Treat your hair from within by taking a multivitamin. Use a hair vitamin that will increase your hair growth rate and lenghthen your natural anagen (growth phase). Also drink at least eight cups of water and eat healthy foods such as fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts, and by exercising regularly to provide good circulation to the scalp.|`|H6J6Q3l8aa	you should try vitamins that are specifically for just hair.i've never tried this before but exoticallure.com is supposed to be good but their very expensive.and theres drmiracles.com they are very affordable.and you can get dr miracles anywhere walmart,sally's,target,walgreens anywhere and it really works.i've been using it for 1 year now and my hair has grown alot and its healthy.most of their products are under $7.Organic Root Stimulator with olive oil works really really good and you can get that anywhere too..
pbVPS24zaa	1. pull the skin of your eyes down until you see your water line clearly.  2. Tilt the pencil and CAREFULLY apply on that water line. When I mean carefully I mean do not poke your eyes.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	pull her lower lid slightly and swipe the liner over the pink part of u lower lid like that inner rim just keep stroking over it until it is like  idk brown|`|cyRDKRIDaa	You put the liner (pencil) on the waterline (under and above) of your eye.|`|C8zrNMRjaa	you put on on the inside line of your eye, like before your eyelashes start, its hard to explain, but there is a line between your eyelashes and your eye ball, you put it there.|`|N3qnOlehaa	i just line my water line. it gives me that "lined" look, but it's really soft and subtle. here's how: pull down the skin on your lower lid and expose the water line (the reddish pink skin lining your eyeball). run your pencil along that, putting some pressure on it. don't be afraid of putting the eyeliner on there. it might feel weird at first, but it feels absolutely normal after a while. Practice makes perfect! plus doing this takes like 10 seconds, so it's really easy! Good luck : )|`|fYox2mwGaa	I usually pull the skin gently by putting my fingertip in the outside corner of my eye... this helps to eliminate extra slack in the skin.  Then I gently use the liner in a back and forth sweeping motion.  I start at one corner and work my way to the other one.  I normally go underneath the lashes.  Then if you need to do any touch ups just gently erase mistakes with a Q Tip.|`|PLLfP1lNaa	I like to apply an eyeliner stick (softer than a kohl pencil) right on the lower inside rim of the lashes. Usually it comes off pretty quickly but leaves a subtle trace just at the base of the lower lashes. Or you could carefully dot the eyeliner under your lower lashes and then blend it with a q-tip or a make up sponge.|`|AsGLzyZgaa	use a black eyeliner pencil and lightly put it on right below your lashes and sort of smudge it for a natural look.|`|yHWkQs9Paa	Make sure you get it as close to your lash line as possible. If the eyeliner you're using is too thick to do this, buy a thinner kind. Also, you can try not lining the whole lower part of your eye. Just do the outside part. These pics might help:     http://www.polyvore.com/eyeliner/set?id=...|`|H331wkQdaa	pull ur bottom of ur eye down the the water line put it there but itll were off easy so thats how i  were it an its easy an quick
IbI487CYaa	It's stupid to report someone because if they disagree with you. If you don't want the truth told then don't post your pictures.    You know what annoys me? When people put pictures up but then gets mad when everyone says they hate their facial expression and that they're ugly. If you don't want the truth don't post your pictures on the Internet.|`|VR3soAktaa	who cares what they think.  dont be telling on everyone for saying their opinions, just let them be. delet the comment or whatever. and move on like it was nothing :)|`|a509bf79e80b35be114f3270cce0b89daa	I don't report them.

Z0Vds9oCaa	Don't change for one guy.    Personally I hate girls who are like that. Its disgusting for someone to slut themselves up because one guy likes it. You will actually repulse more guys than you attract.|`|HvHBF8glaa	NOPE!!!|`|IUQZFrMfaa	exactly what i was thinking, blondie_.   honestly. judging by your name and your question, i'm guessing you're either an exotic dancer or a ballerina by day, prostitute by night.  and no, if that's why a guy likes you, i wouldn't go out with him in the first place.|`|pWnsUHMBaa	that actually sounds realllyyy ugly    wear tight skinny jeans  high heels.  and a sort of cleavagly top with a blazer vest over top or a cropped cardigan.     dont change your style for him.   casue then you will always have to dress like that for him.  be yourself and he will probbaly admire you for that|`|b7TueUUPaa	definitely not. you need to respect yourself more. then other people will. i promise.    cute clothes sites:  www.modcloth.com  www.gojane.com  www.forever21.com  www.rue21.com  www.wetseal.com    trust me, guys don't want it all hanging out.. well some do, but they just want sex, not you.|`|faVvldMeaa	No.|`|Zb0deAf4aa	what are you a hooker?|`|ilTdInlFaa	hey if your walking down the street and a guy pulls over and asks you how much, it is not his fault you really do look like a hooker|`|KnL8PS3Eaa	Not hot.

I am guessing i'm around your same age... I wouldn't change anything! don't wear makeup or tan like someone said.    I would not say you were hot... you are too young to be referred to as hot but... you will grow up to be hot.|`|ppRbL18eaa	I are pretty, it would be better if we could see your face better (like, more up close) and maybe try wearing light makeup that illuminates your face and maybe use some bronzing powder to make your face look tanner. It looks like you're pretty skinny and have a nice body, just tan more in the Summer. (but don't over tan!!) Overall, you're pretty and have nothing to worry about with looks. Also, wear tighter (but not TOO tight) of clothes to show your body shape and how skinny you are. Hey, as long as your skinny you might as well show it!! Lol, that's what I do anyways!! Peace, Allie?|`|9Y9BBB99aa	you are gorgeous =)  i would date you in a second!!|`|5qCeTQEcaa	cute, 13, maybe tan a little? or wear some blush but thats all|`|3LB6FPmgaa	Your amazingly pretty!  I guess 15!    Just I think your hair would go better down.  Don't wear makeup because your naturally beautiful!      Also I think you should let your hair grow out below your shoulders    ~Alaina|`|CfD1bRNtaa	You look great. I'd guess 14, but nowadays who can tell?    13-15.|`|zTal4HIGaa	I think you look fine i looked like that when i was younger all the guys at school were hitting on me|`|1FAakFh0aa	your very very pretty, i cant really tell form the pic but kinda like mischa barton and she is beautiful      i cant call you hot cause you look young, you have a youthful beauty about you, in a few years ill call you hot! you look sweet and natural too, i was expecting some makeup face bleached hair big boobed girl when i opened that pic and to be honest only opened it expecting to laugh at soem bimbo but you look lovely!|`|QYJcK7EDaa	That pictures pretty cute, you look just pretty there, but your hairs more casual, so you'd look more beautiful-er with it down or something (hah dont want to sound creepish)    and hot, you'd prolly wanna ask guys honestly.    you look 14-15.    and you shouldn't do anything, in my opinon
CfD1bRNtaa	It all depends on personal preference. I like natural nails and when girls wear their hair down.     Though I think most guys like red nails. I don't know about the hair though, side bangs seem to be well liked.|`|C6d4ndMOaa	It's all about preference. I prefer the natural look; clean clear nails and long hair. I don't care about hair color as long its natural and looks good with her.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	yes, nail color is important..any color will do.    and hair..."the Farrah" will get you the most attention from guys despite it being 30 years old|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	I don't care about nail polish color because that's where my eyes won't be. If you have nice hair, just let it naturally be. Ponytails are ok, but getting some bangs in the face is sexy|`|aTwEUANXaa	A lot of girls dont get this, but guys dont give a **** about nails. i have honestly never in my life talked to a friend about a girls nails, and i never hear anyone talking about it.    Hair is a slightly different story, but *** and boobs is what counts the most.|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	I dont think nail color is important, nut any guy I have ever sked what color I should paint my nails, they say blue.|`|jf1oPsSeaa	well a lot of the guys i know think red is the sexiest nail polish  and they like hair down, but not all the time.  messy buns are hot too.|`|cXj0RqExaa	All guys like different nail colors, I'm pretty sure they don't care though. I know most guys prefer girls who wear their hair down.|`|MitVhIK9aa	each guy has there own taste, so its hard to tell. most guys like hair down though i do know that, i don't think gi=uys to much pay attention to nails, its not like they stair ! aha.    [=|`|PCRgcpy1aa	I don't think guys notice anything a/b a woman, unless it has 2 do w/ her development of the body! You kno wat I mean? I like guys alot, but I kno from experience that they r stupid sometimes. Well hoped that helped!|`|pFmtHEv4aa	I don't think it really matters to them. It's usually how you look as a whole|`|1FAakFh0aa	well i dont know about all guys but i keep my nails short and neat and wear red nail polish, i always carry a bottle in my bag so i never let it get chipped and i get guys compliment my nails, which i always thougth guys didnt notice that thing, i just liked them that way anyway .    and hair....i dunno but i think guys just like long healthy looking shiny hair, like not crazy curly, but not poker straight cause that looks fake, but you know, kinda wavy, or naturally straight looking.      http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archi...    Its cheryl cole, see her hair is thick looking and shiny and i dont know what guy wouldnt like it!|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	I think guys like clean soft hands with no nail polish or clear polish. They like smooth soft silky hair with a cute style and soft to the touch.
Fb0Ch8Kxaa	no i don't think its bad to wear it. some people are lucky enough to have flawless skin and they don't need it. but if you have scarring and thats something you want to hide you should just wear it. don't worry about what they think :)|`|zpovg4U7aa	its absolutely not fake. just make sure you blend it in very well. or just use a little bit of concealer instead of foundation. but they're just being mean and aren't used to someone doing something different and out of the ordinary.|`|3LB6FPmgaa	You know if they make fun of you:    1. they're mean  2. they're not your friends    But i know u like them a lot  so try a different foundation or ask your friends for help   its not fake or bad|`|4UrUzpAHaa	It's not bad, so long as you wash it off every night to prevent pimples.  If putting on a little foundation makes you feel more confident, than there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.  Make sure your foundation matches your skin type thought.  You definitely don't want to walk around with an orange patch on your face or something! Makeup counters at department stores will be more than happy to help make a good match for you.|`|YbO7D6axaa	If they're making fun of you, they aren't your friends. And no, it's not a bad thing to try to cover something that makes you uncomfortable. Don't let them get to you, you're doing the right thing. :)|`|bKOLx4vZaa	not at all.I'm just about to be 15 and put it on my forhead to cover a scar too.  Using it does'nt mean you're fake.  I know why you do it, the scars seem embarrassing and you just want to be able to feel confident and more sure of yourself.Just because they say you're fake doesn't mean their bad friends and you should'nt hate them.All girls at your age and my age too make fun of each to feel better about themselves or just for enjoyment.It'll happen for a long time so just find out who your true friends are and do what makes you happy.Because in a few years when they're gone all you'll really think of is the good times.|`|9e7LvvhAaa	Hun truly its not fake!!!! As long as it matches your skin tone well and you blend it out so it looks natural it will not be fake. True friends would be nicer about it!
Lk2bAl4Eaa	eye lashes are hair...idk about the trimming part...but I'v knoticed that your eye lashes usually grow up to wear your eyebrows start. and soo if your eyebrows are really close to your eyes, thats about as long as they'll grow...idk. lol

uMhsIP7Eaa	if your dress is that bright, then you should only have a light, glowing, and natural make-up. you can try white to almost beige shimmer for your eyes; liquid eye liner in your upper eyelid; mascara;  just a natural browny eyeliner that's almost nothing in the outer corner of your lower eyelid then put a little white shimmer on it that you will put on as your eyeshadow; you should have a not-so-pink blush on but a bit of glowy. for your lips, go on a very natural look :D

You shouldn't be worrying about not fitting in if you act like the rest of them do (well a majority of them).

claW4UUcaa	frizz ease has great hair care products. chi straighteners are expensive but they work really well and in my opinion are worth every penny. they get hot fast so it doesn't take long. i have really thick hair to. it works fine on me. at my last hair appointment i asked her to thin out my hair. it cut down my drying time and it's easier for me to style my hair now. best of luck!|`|Vwnwsx3paa	I have the exact same hair style. What I do is just brush it down, and put a hair band on. Sometimes I have it in pigtails, ponytails, braids, etc. It's your hair and you can do what ever you want with it!!!!  :> ?|`|X8XYpUHQaa	omg! i used to have the same exact problem! only mine was soft black, wich is very very dark brown.     straightening: curling makes it look way too volumnized. but if you want to, soft waves/curls at the tips makes it look cool! so use a curling iron. straightening your hair is probably the best choice though. there is a special iron called a CHI. its designed to straighten and curl. it looks more like a straightner but the person that sells it will probably show you. you can find it at ULTA and other makeup stores like that. when you straighten, start up and then slide down smoothly. this means you might want to condition very well. this gives you a sleek look.    blow drying:  With thick hair it's all about how long it can take to style. To help cut down on time remove 80% (most of the moisture) by shake or rough drying with your hands before you start to use your brush to style the hair. This is because your hair is not going to take on any shape until you get to this stage so you may as well rough dry out the worst of the moisture first.    dying/streaking: Above, streaks of different colors are used to make the hair look less thick as they break up a solid look. Never use solid or all over color on thick hair as it can make it look almost wig like.     hair cuts: get layers. they really help. they make your hair look thinner, and especially since its mediumish short it'll look really cute. my friend did this and it was awesome.    highlights: go high/low lights if you ever decide to do it. you really dont want to go all over with the dye or it looks too...solid and thick.
yx5n8yzOaa	I don't think you look eleven ;)    pretty :)|`|sJfB1Xe4aa	I don't think you look 11, but if you feel you need to look more your age you can try a little make up, just don't over do it. Maybe try just a little mascara and upper eye liner.
FOAJht6yaa	You should get your makeup and eyelashes done at a MAC make up counter near you. They do almost all of my friends make up for formals and stuff, and they'll do it for free if you get them to put fake eyelashes on you for around 11 dollars. It looks really good actually. Considering I'm a girl. Get a wig, borrow a dress, clip on earrings, heels/boots... etc! Good make up is essential though to not looking drag.|`|MBqoeaEJaa	WHAT THE ****?  YOU ******!!!  jk  put a dress on and wear makeup|`|VcZ61o57aa	i bet u and ur friends have all kinds of fun|`|N1rwfsDXaa	try not to wear too much makeup otherwise you'll look like a drag queen. the same goes for hair--a huge, curly platinum blonde wig will look way too fake and obvious. go for something more natural (like maybe a brown wig?) also, if you want to cover your legs you could wear a long skirt. anyways, have fun! haha|`|QzzhssWYaa	well wear a bra and if your wearing a skirt or a dress shave your legs and for make-up: eyeliner,eyeshadow,and lip gloss. and get a wig with long hair(: haha

bc1DQvINaa	usually, you buy them at the eye doctor,and you can have them tinted
K9HGhZOnaa	You shouldn't use a cheap brand that you can get from walmart!! I would use  Anti-Snap by redken, or Ego Boost by Bedhead, or Silk reconsturtor by Chi!! Those are the 3 I would recommend and they are all under $20! Go to Ulta.com|`|st5reHVjaa	pantene?  but really, nothing. its damaged cause u've been using too much stuff on it already.  let it be hair, let it grow. LEAVE IT ALONE|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Buy some coconut oil at your local food store.  A jar costs around $12.  Warm a little bit up in your microwave (not too hot!) and apply it to your hair.  Put on a shower cap and leave it on at least an hour.  If your hair is severely damaged, leave it on overnight.  Then shampoo and condition, as usual.  It comes out easily and does not make your hair greasy.  It works wonders on hair damage.  Be sure to put a lot of it on the ends of your hair because that's usually the part that's the most damaged.  Do this at least every other day until your hair gets back into good condition.  Then do it as needed, for maintenance.  Good luck!|`|CEMhkRxuaa	Try herbal essences or pantene. (it worked for me)|`|BrkoO6dsaa	I have been there! dont worry use tresseme for dry hair and it will go back to rich and smooth.It worked for me.|`|G1xnTzwBaa	Weird, as I type this my head is all wrapped up in towels and a plastic bag because I'm doing a hot oil treatment!    The one I'm doing is DIY, and really easy to make (I'm sure you have all the ingredients in your kitchen already, so basically - it's free!). If you have long hair, you will need 4-6 tbsp of olive oil ( mine is about 2 inches past my shoulders and I used 5 tbsp, it was just enough). Put that in a plastic baggie (ziplock) and seal it, then put it in a cup of hot water (not boiling though), and let it sit for a couple of minutes. While you're doing that, get half a cup of mayonnaise and mix into it 2 egg YOLKS, and stir it well. Then add in the oil, which by now should be very warm (but not hot to the touch). Stir it well, and ignore the smelll :D Apply this all to your hair, you can just use your hands, and make sure you cover it thoroughly. Once that's done, wrap your head in a plastic bag (from the grocery store, or like a CVS bag, etc. but not a ziplock one, obvviously hahah) to keep the warmth of the mixture in, and to keep it from seeping into the towel. The towel should be wrapped around your head OVER the plastic bag. (Make sure also that you don't put the plastic bag over your whole head, just your hair, you can use an elastic to tye the excess in a little knot so it wont slip off). That's the step I'm at! Now you let it sit for 30 minutes, then rinse it out, shampoo, and use conditioner if you want, to get the smell out and you're doneee! Don't use water that's too hot while rinsing it out or you could essentially "cook" the egg yolks in your hair, which would be a pain in the asss to get out.    Have fun! I've heard this works well. I'll edit this once I see how it turns out on me.|`|VP2fsPWzaa	here you will find a simple method that costs a few dollars and there are some of my friends happy with it ....    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|6f3f6d718fae9cac71e77cc6c1c1c47daa	Tresemme!    moisture shampoo,  it works!
Fb0Ch8Kxaa	you're doing everything right :)    i think the best liquid foundation is revlon colorstay  http://www.revlon.com/ProductCatalog/Sub...    and the best powder foundation (in my opinion) is MAC's studio fix powder plus foundation.  http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....    and as for the smudging i'd suggest using a primer such as:    urban decay primer potion  too faced shadow insurance  loreal de-crease  coastalscents.com's eye poxy shadow primer    hope i've helped :)|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Sounds good to me. You can actually even put the concealer over the foundation. That way you'll use less concealer. Traditionally powders don't give tons of coverage, so stick to the liquid if you're looking for something a bit more opaque. And if you're looking for a way to keep your eye liner from smudging, try setting it with an eyeshadow of the same color. Hope that helped! Good luck!|`|okuKFwdNaa	your steps are good    bare minerals is amazing    liquid eyeliner never smudges for me well when its dry  or waterproof regular pencil liner

wIYcWKwNaa	i also have extremly long thick hair   but mine is a mid-dark brown.   I have layers as i find -that it is also eaiser to deal with   & it looks alot nicer   i reckon go soft layers around your face & one length at the back   (if ya want a mix of both)  otherwise do what ya want with it. you are the one that will have to deal with it & a wise person once said to me " if you only please others & never please yourself then are you actually living to please others or living to be the best you can be ?"   i dont really get it but it seems kinda relevant to this questions     HTH  Tay|`|st5reHVjaa	i think that thinning it out is good.  i also think that people look good with short brown hair, not blonde.  but it always depends on ur face shape.  i think that u should cut it. get layers. keep bangs|`|npcBmxI8aa	Messy layers could look amazing in dirty blonde hair or it could look out of place. It depends on a couple of things. First it matters what your face shape is and if the cut you want will work with it. Second it depends on your personality. Like if you are a really shy person and you show up to school with crazy hair people will be kind of freaked out. Personally i like the messy hair better because it looks more model-ish. haha. good luck!|`|BrkoO6dsaa	my friend did the layers and thinned out and it looks great i love that style. I would ddo it but i have brown hair. Go for it.|`|10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	Actually I have the same exact hair, except for the length, dammit.  I have actually heard that thinning it out makes it worse, but if it works for you then keep it up.  It always make my thick hair worse because I have VERY curly hair.  I guess it would depend on that too.  If your hair is curly, thinning it out might make it worse.  If it's straight, you could probably get away with thinning it out.  If you have bangs then it might look better with layers.
PriORKlOaa	Don't cut it!    It looks good the way it is.|`|st5reHVjaa	u'd look fine with any haircut, espically short.  u could go as short as ryan seacrest's hair. and yes, that'd look good with ur face shape. but please no coconut head style!|`|y3FPtEZ6aa	i think u should just cut it ear length but not all of cuz u look cute with u long hair|`|VzBLSyfkaa	YES!! PLEASE DO!!|`|DySUxIn4aa	Your face has a great shape, cutting it short would look fine.|`|8xMlAzTJaa	hmm u will look really cute either way!|`|TF4nZhvAaa	omg your a CUUUUUUUUUTIE :D    I really like your hair long.|`|HBYHD0J3aa	don't go to short i think you look cute with the hair you have. but yeah it'll look fine.|`|NW2H5HC1aa	you would look really good with short hair|`|10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	I don't know why, but I find a short cut with sideswept bangs would look good on you.|`|Q5gvGAvZaa	yes yes yesss! get a haircuut like ryan seacrest only a little longer. just a little longer though. it would look good w/ your glasses && your face shape.
K6AwRDyKaa	try forever21, i think its your style|`|9rQzQxexaa	pacsun, wet seal, forever 21, delias  pretty much every store will have SOMETHING or the other that you would like, even if its only like 1 shirt. mix and match and youll find your style.|`|vbvvFVmVaa	pacsun?|`|TWMXMOLUaa	i don't think that look exists!! i think you just made that up in ur head!|`|ywl35HeEaa	try pac sun. you will like it! also forever 21 i guess... some of their clothes are your style.    ALSO try delia's! they have colored skinny jeans and cool punk t's that you would like.|`|d5ppt4jFaa	hehe then i think your style would be rocker vintage chic :] but you can find alot of things at random stores like maybe target,forever 21,urban outfitters, wet seal (sometimes) but you can find this everywhere because vintage is very in style now all you have to do is add the rocker which is not that hard either.|`|dbUWukQdaa	DEB|`|dO5fAEghaa	pac sun...rue 21|`|PsQFasl4aa	forever 21 charlotte russe & delias theres a lot a random stuff you can mix and match into w.e style you want|`|qtDtHwFfaa	It's a cute style, but, no matter what your style, you don't want to stick to one store. Try a bunch of different ones and find different pieces everywhere. For you though, I'd recommend Forever 21 or Pac Sun. If you want a really unique look, try your luck at some thrift stores.|`|iEjCmMMPaa	Urban outfitters or american apparel.  they are sort of expensive, but you can get a few quality items and shop at used stores ( like salvation army and buffalo exchange) for accesories.

bWdpSzkwaa	Either your brushing to hard, or your gums are ripped, or you have gingivitis im betting its gingivitis there is this stuff thats really good for gingivitis and its called oil of oregano its tastes really bad but it works really good use it everyday just take a mouth full of water and put a couple drops of oil of orengano and swish it around your mouth for about a minute it takes usually 4 weeks to work but it cuts it right be use it 2 times a day BE PREPARED BECAUSE THIS STUFF IS HOT!|`|a6hQftotaa	It might be a ripped gum.  So rinse your mouth with salt water tell you feel and see the difference.  Hope I helped  =D|`|rU1UyOAlaa	gingivitis.  maybe use a softer bristle toothbrush.|`|Jd7SnU4Vaa	maybe you're brushing too hard.|`|Pswqhimoaa	it could be gingivities, or you could be brushing to hard.  Use mouthwash / floss. If you still have problems in a month, go to the dentist.|`|JOR9dSSuaa	it could be because ur teeth r super sensitive to the tooth paste that you're using. or you're brushing too hard. get a soft bristle toothbrush and gently brush your gums. it could also be because your gums aren't used to being brushed... just give it one more day, if not then call your dentist.|`|AA11950233	ask the dentist.|`|cZyeJ2praa	go back to that doctor    some doc messed up my mom tooth and her gumm were bleeding for like 2 months before she went back and they gave her some sort of pills to make the bleeding go away|`|WmAE7DQVaa	you maybe brushing to hard causing your gums to bleed    try being more gentle|`|ap6KKOjFaa	i had the same thing they said it was just my gums maybe u r brush to hard|`|1Q7vREwzaa	I hope you follow this cause I barely can but... Since you had a cavity you probably wasn't brushing much, so you got a cavity, when you're not used to brushing much, you're teeth and gums are sensitive, it happened to me. The reason it might be bleeding more where you got your tooth fixed is because it's more delicate now, like you would be after surgery.|`|Rc7Omc5Haa	Rinse with Listerine for 30 seconds before you brush. It does burn but if it's gingivitis it will get rid of it and should help prevent it.
7pwrjsXuaa	during the day, i use burt's bees lip balm. sooo refreshing !  and at night, i use vaseline(:  these two products leave my lips reallyy soft and moisturized.|`|YbO7D6axaa	I'd use Vaseline at night because it's probably one of the best things for hydrating lips. And for daytime I use Burt's Bees Original. It's amazing at hydrating lips and it stays on until you wash it off. It's about $3 and it's also got a peppermint smell/flavor so it freshens your breath as well. :)|`|iUDrNbcxaa	i use vaseline all the time, day and night. i've even gotten compliments on my "lip gloss" haha. i haven't had chapped lips for months and months.|`|WrY12p6Xaa	i use burt's bees.

kCdISEGqaa	Please, don't blame your artist, it probably has nothing to do with how they applied the tattoo.  It could be as simple as your skin didn't accept the ink as well as it should have, or, you might have been sick and didn't know it, and when the tattoo was applied, your white blood cells, responsible for healing, were busy.  I know it sounds silly, but, it's true.  It sounds like a scar, and it is possible to go back in and tattoo over the raised scar, known as a keloid, and break up the scar tissue while adding more color to it.  When I was in my apprenticeship, I got a tattoo and it did the same thing, part of the outline raised like that and looked gray.  My teacher let it heal completely, then hit it again and broke up the scar tissue while adding more color.  Sounds kind of silly, but, you could Google it and find out more about it.  Go back to the artist that did it and ask about it.  Good luck with it!!!|`|JafLyLYgaa	I dont see how he can fix the "raising" part. Thats just scarring. But he can definetely filly in the black.|`|l5zJ1bldaa	definitely, just tell the other tattoo artist what you want done. and make sure he does it EXACTLY how you want it.    but first, go back to the other tattoo artist and complain.|`|IPkzHYdraa	Mine is the same, I've got a few tattoo's and they have all healed fine, except for these 3 stars I have on my left wrist... and for some reason it just won't seem to go flat like the other tattoo's I have?  It hasn't turnt gray, but its still bumpy. *nearly a year later!*    I think that a good artist will be able to tattoo over your bumpy tattoo ... you should get a consult from a different artist.
eGpOIV12aa	i hope you are asking about South Carolina Gamecocks and their teams appearel
acVPPTD2aa	Yeah bob hair cuts are cool|`|NMMYw8WDaa	Hmm    Long layers with a either a parted fringe or side swept fringe  But I personally would just shorten the fringe just a tad to create more layers that frame the face (it would make it less round looking)    I might google some images later  too lazy right now  xD    I would suggest your hair getting cut to your collar bone, with long layers  just above it a little bit.   Make sure your hairdresser knows long, subtle (if that is what you want)|`|nUu7tUiqaa	For anyone with a round face, you need to stay away from anything that frames your face, as it will just make it look rounder. Your best bet is to go with something long and layered, as the layers will offset a round face, or something shorter than your chin, as that will create nice drama and is very stylish.|`|GOKNG35daa	Try A sew in Weave  A bob|`|GYJSuTXIaa	Maybe a bob hair cut, so sort of short.|`|MCz2m10uaa	you should get side bangs so that it can frame ur face more & alot of short layers around ur head for volume. =]

7EheyuEwaa	first of all that is so cute! i might get one for myself.  anyway for work a silky blouse with a beaded necklace would be nice.  a turtleneck with a long chain type necklace (check at claire's or h & m).|`|hQsvuxs3aa	http://www.tillys.com/tillys/variants.as...|`|HvHBF8glaa	a thank top.|`|Cc3rFatJaa	A dark gray tube or tank top.|`|Uyf8Kkq1aa	a black spagtti strap? maybe|`|bL3rzrEYaa	If it's gray, you can wear any solid color underneath and it would be totally cute. What is the occasion, school? I would wear like they have it with a spaghetti strap underneath, or any cute blouse that is solid color. Just try on shirts you have with it and see what looks good. Those cardigans are cute and comfy good buy  :o) You can wear it with jeans or with dress pants so it's very versatile. Lovvvvee them.    Hope I helped!|`|Y4pfVX10aa	a tank top any color is fine or shirt and jeans......|`|ic7GSkM1aa	a tank top any color would be fine even a t-shirt would be nice|`|a8pzuKINaa	i dont really know how to help if the color isnt online but i suggest black and white they go with everything|`|llamLKgLaa	If the color of the cardigan is light grey, then I think that I would do a bright color under it.  You could go with one of these http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do... in the blue, purple, pink, red or the orange.  Pair it with either dark denim or black bottoms.|`|IcTnDRC4aa	You'll want to wear something that has a bit of detail on it. Like a tank with beading at the top, or a funky cut. Or if you must wear a tank top, make sure to wear jewelry: a pendant necklace, or a necklace with a single charm. Also I suggest wearing studs, you want simple and clean. A bracelet, simple, like a tiffany tag.
d107a66f105e195f090c296ea6ac5b01aa	I've tried it before, and it didnt' work at all for me. I have some other friends who also use it, and so far it hasn't done anything for them. But I have extremely tough skin, so maybe that's why it didn't work. If you have skin that reacts well with products, and mild acne, then i would say maybe you should try it. It all really depends on the skin type you have, since everyones varies. Overall, i would just say not to try it. Goodluck!|`|yW6KCd7iaa	i tried it for a few weeks and it didnt get rid of all but my mom bought me murad so i didnt really get to see if it would work or not. if you want i have more than half a bottle of the products left if you want it lol
sTwq3jVBaa	well it all depends on how fast your hair grows.  Usually i get one ever 2-3 weeks.
2U27BgmKaa	that's just because the skin around the hairs on your leg are very sensitive. it's slight irritation around the hair opening from the razor. i epilate my legs, but i use an unscented aftershave that i share with my boyfriend. it really doesn help.|`|LIp8cV6jaa	i know my girlfriend has them too
nvsVXlBlaa	lots. google it|`|YbO7D6axaa	A makeup artist salary really depends on the budget and level of client. Madonna's and/or Beyonce's makeup artist is going to earn a large makeup artist salary because of the clients they bring in! I would say that a makeup artist salary can range from $450-$2000 a day. Or anywhere from $37,000-$150,000.
8hkexSHgaa	Well I don't know off the top of my head anything about colortration... but for a black tattoo (how big is it??) you might need something more like theater quality makeup. Talk to the gals at the makeup stores to make sure you know what kind of shade to look for.
wZDrrTBqaa	pretty good looking scale 1-10 1 being highest/ prettiest I would say 6 or 7 could do a lot to improve I reckon u could pull off front bangs  what is going on with that thing on ur head?|`|C6d4ndMOaa	Cute!

Your face?  Your hair?    You have healthy hair... if you're asking if you should change anything I would say get a few highlights in your hair and maybe front bangs. You're pretty, but really plain.   :)|`|IalXpm7Uaa	Really nice, and as everyone is saying, gorgeous hair. In the first photo you look really, really white though.|`|d5t5XgfVaa	me like your hair|`|Ney5tJ1Oaa	you have pretty hair|`|VcZ61o57aa	ahhh My eyes shave ur head thats nasty|`|qhgU91Koaa	you are really pretty.plus you don't look like everyone else which is good!

K7UdZ097aa	wearing brown eyeshadow- the 3 tone(lid, crease,brow bone)- should bring out ur blue eyes, and get a foundation that is exactly your skin type. You can figure that out by putting a little on your hand. Dont go overboard with blush. If u have fair skin, get a light color of blush,if not get a darker color that looks best, and put it on the apples of ur cheeks. Some blushes come with 2 colors. One the blush color and one a very light shimmery color. Put the shimmery color above the apples of ur cheeks. As for eyeliner, use eyeshadow. It doesnt put creases under your eyes after a while like eyeliner does, and it looks more natural.  hope that helped!|`|7pwrjsXuaa	i use bare minerals foundation and it feels very natural yet covers up things pretty well.  as for bringing out your blue eyes, i'd say go with gold and orange-ish colors(:|`|IvuWy8Usaa	to bring out your eyes.. 'define a lash' by maybelline is a really great mascara that will bring out your eyes and 'dream matte mousse foundation' by covergirl will make your skin look flawless  hope this helps (:
VGwcNQC2aa	i love black eyliner and mascara  and yeah gold eyeshadow is perfect|`|7pwrjsXuaa	colors in the orange-ish familiaa;  like gold, copper, brown-ish, etc.  it'll make your eyes crazy stunningg(:|`|uBnF74YWaa	Definitely dark eyeshadows, they make blue eyes pop out even more!  I think brown, gold and green. But anything looks good with blue eyes :D|`|aKjIkMy8aa	Gold eyeshadow looks stunning on blue eyes! well really any color looks good on blue eyes but gold especially!|`|DCCxyYu8aa	I think black or a greenish blueish color or even  gold looks really cool.... and try white over black...
MdhRRPHjaa	try find from this website
ENXfwDVBaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSj2E_iiC...    Btw use a eyelash curler before applying the mascrara and stuff..idk my sister showed me how to..|`|itxjeys4aa	Heeey :)(L)  Use Define A Lash  Its a red bottle, and put it on the top lash,  and on the bottom and put alittle bit of eye liner on the  top lidd, and some on the bottom :)|`|WcHP8gz8aa	try using define a lash in the pink tube...i wear it and it works|`|4a7f262367ce439921ed41cf674ac9e8aa	First stop using waterproof mascara every day. It is drying and will cause the lashes to break. Collosal mascara is really good. Apply one coat and allow it to dry. Then add another coat allowing each coat to dry completely.   Take time to apply root to tips in slow even strokes.Good Luck!!!|`|0CU89oyeaa	I think it's all about the mascara quality. I really love DiorShow mascara at Sephora. It's got a really big brush and makes my eyelashes really big. It's kind of pricey though, for mascara. It's usually around $24.    When I apply it, I like to go slower and go from the base of my lashes where it meets the eyelid all the way out to the tips. This way my lashes never clump together. I usually do about 2 coats, but alternating eyes so the first coat has time to dry a bit before you do another. I also put a bit more on the outer lashes to make them look a bit longer.
6YwLlYovaa	Max factor has some great volumising mascaras, so yeah, for full lashes you should definitely try them out. as far as the maybelline lash stiletto goes it's really great for adding length, but it doesn't really make your lashes look that full or add very much volume.    of course you could try using BOTH, the lash stiletto for length and a max factor volumising one to add some fullness. then you'd have the best of both worlds, really long, really thick, really full lashes. which would be great!|`|mkNAvMtPaa	I loved Max Factor mascara's! I thought they were the best, but then they discontinued the products in Canada :(   I have tried Maybelline Stiletto mascara and it is garbage. It makes the lashes spidery, and the stuff crumbles off the lashes to no end. It smells good, but not worth it.   I would def go with the Max Factor mascara!
29d245c6068a80708e3b9f681a4cb2d0aa	Pancake is a very heavy makeup. Yes it can be oily if you have oily skin. I have used it and the Pan Stik for many years because I have bad skin and need a lot of coverage. It was used heavily in the 50's for tv and stage, and is still used by some makeup artist. If you like a flawless coverage and do not have sensitive skin, give it a try.

7tnb4On2aa	If it's just a red spot, even with the skin around it, then no, it is not a scar.   These red spots take from 6-12 months to fade on their own.    If the spot is indented from the skin around it, then yes, it is a scar.  A fresh scar does well with applied honey nightly.   Be sure to put honey on a band-aid and place it overtop too, for a double whammy.

v0fooLeTaa	If you are wearing silver necklace you should go with silver shoes and a bag with a bit of silver on, same goes if you are wearing gold. Black shoes are also an option but I think you can wear more intricate shoes. The bag should be small; perhaps a clutch because all you need is some money, lipstick, drivers license and perhaps a credit card and tissues.     Here are some links for you:    This clutch http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2996593/0~23... with these shoes:   http://www.shoes.com/Shopping/ProductDet...

TDFTZcjYaa	Ohh man been thereee.    Well you could just try stopping by the place and saying hi to the guy, even with your brother there. it'll just look like you're being polite in his eyes. however, look at how the guy responds to you. does he smile, say hi back, etc? don't be too obvious, but let him know you're not just his friend's little sis. wear cute clothes on the days you order something from where he works. i know it sounds cheesy, but if you change something slightly in what you wear that day, he's more likely to notice you because it's not what he's used to seeing. if you give him that extra split second to really look at you, it could make all the difference.    on the other hand, if you really believe there's no chance and just want to forget about him, then just rid yourself of all things that reminds you of him. avoid going into the pizza place with your brother. try to make a believable excuse to not go in. if you ever wrote anything about him or something, rip it up and throw it in the trash. (I suggest ripping it up rather than shredding because it lets out a lot of aggression or whatever) just try your best not to think about him. keep yourself busy. picturing you two being together is only going to make you more upset if it doesn't work out, because the more you imagine it the more you believe it can happen. I know from experience.      anyway, try the first one at least if you really want to be with him, which I can tell you do. Just give it a chance. if that doesn't work out, move on to plan B. it'll take a while to completely get over it, but the less you dwell on it and the faster you just avoid thinking about him, you'll get over him faster.      i hope i helped. good luck you seem sweet =)

No one wants to be judged.|`|F7TySwQkaa	Standing out is what most people prefer.. but i would rather lay low and not be seen or heard    low chucks.. in classic black|`|MIILkAR4aa	i seriously have nothing from any of those stores  the new town i moved in every1 there has things from  holister ect. one day i saw 4 people wearing the same thing in  my skool.  they dont have any self of steem and dont want to be talked about me i love standing out its what i do|`|4mwVxvLOaa	stand out  low chucks      i wear cloths from rue 21& i have lots of freinds|`|hJmVcWekaa	Because everyone wants to belong to some extent.  You just have to learn to stand out in a way.  For some people its easier than others.  Even if you stand out your are still fitting in with a group that likes people who stand out.  But i agree there needs to be more diversity.  I would go with stand out and low chucks for sure.  Haha sorry I'm just a fan of them.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Some people just have to have what their friends have or think that it's cool to have what is the "what is in" brands. They don't realize or don't care that they are paying three times as much for the exact same thing as any other brand. They are actually paying for the name. Then they don't realize that then they are also walking advertisements for them. The companies win either way because people are pretentious. Good for you for being an individual.|`|1suIEET4aa	yea i was wondering the same thing today..everybody wears the same ****..i mean i dont care but then it gets annoying.like everybodys wearing flannel..i saw a store with a bunch of flannel pattern and half the people i know wears flannel.its like ok people dress how you want not how everybody else is wearing. some people like AE and stuff..so just let them..like i dont care..but for like winter all you saw at the mall was girls with swide-swept bangs layered hair,knit hats,skinny jeans,v-necks or plaid and slouchy boots and vans.it was like evrybody was clones in diffrent colors of clothes.lol.so yeah its kind of annoying but o well.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	stand out! geez who wants to blend in with all the other preppy people out there?    low chucks :)
Pyt1n12Waa	I know exactly how you feel! Does your hair go all, like, frizzy too? I've tried lots of products but nothing seems to work for me, a lot of people have told me that I need to get the ends cut off to keep it straight for longer, but that to me just didn't make sense. I used Tresseme  (not sure if I spelt that right).. straightening balm and that worked for a little while, but then after a couple of weeks my hair went back to curving in again, so I gave up!<br>  sorry I can't really help you, but you could see if that Tresseme thing helps!|`|yCWjBrjnaa	Straight hair.  least you got some. ha original I here you say.<br>  <br>  Its the way you straighten the hair.  Your hair will go in over towards your face try doing it in the opposite direction but don't flick it out just the way your straighten your hair.  if that make sense.<br>  <br>  email me direct if you need more help.<br>  <br>  Thanks sweetie|`|tmcS5iNjaa	aveda stuff works REALLY good. it's kind of expensive but it's worth it.<br>  you can order it online or visit a solon to see if they use it and sell it.<br>  <br>  there is shampoo, conditioner, and a bunch of products for styling.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  =]|`|6OeedpiZaa	USE GARNIER FRUCTOSE PRODUCTS TO WASH AND STYLE!!<br>  BUY A CERAMIC IRON STRAIGHTNER FROM MAXI GLIDE<br>  U NEED TO INVEST TO LOOK GOOD|`|y64uHdyJaa	OMG, you are so hot.

It is either because you straightener sucks(try a chi) or because you are not using the highest temp. Try straightening it like twice in the morning. It could also be because the humidity outside. You could also try hairspray.|`|Ol0vTGx1aa	psh... HAIRSPRAY! my hair doesnt stay straight unless i use frizz control and Hairspray... lol its actually a simple concept!|`|T1XLqqWpaa	ew.<br>  <br>  that guy is wierd as heckk<br>  ull live, dont stress about ur hair, or cut the ends off..lol|`|dcd11iUwaa	yea use a good anti-humicant (AVEDA makes a good one)<br>  and dont put you're hair up in a ponytail, thats what causes the dents.|`|4SyYpBChaa	Hmm, try like really good hold hairspray,<br>  or go to the hairdressers to get it shaped so it stays straight forever.|`|eHwVmZo8aa	yeah may be try hair spray idk it works for me like when you are drying you hair spray the spray at the same thie when stratening it to so maybe try that might work it did for me one thime so try it just tryen to help if it dont work srry thow later !|`|bKwQyCEHaa	maybe you should get a different flat iron or after you flat iron it spray something in it|`|0fXUZ3SRaa	I use this stuff that heats up my hair more when i straighten it. Its a cream that you put in your damp hair|`|BO28Mn8haa	Bed Head: Control Freak
2KMYz3Rjaa	What I do is french braid my hair into two sections right after I blowdry it. So to answer your question no it does not have to be wet, I do it dry and I get perfect beachy waves in the morning! Just take our the braid, run your fingers through it, and spray a bit of hairspray and it works perfectly!|`|GygOv3dIaa	As it gross it will change it's shape   But if you want to help it, braiding it, it will be just for some time, and it will get back to normal. But as times passes by, it wil ttake the shape you want. (Wavy)|`|UQWusO1waa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR0AGrsCA...|`|WWtYCxFhaa	yeah to do the braids your hair has to be damp.  after you get out of the shower, let it dry a little until its damp, then braid it.  you can do a bunch of braids for tighter waves, or 2 or 3 braids for larger, looser waves.  sleep on it, then in the morning when its dry take the braids out and youve got waves! but dont brush your hair or it will take the waves out and make your hair really poofy|`|hZlwaaP2aa	my hairs the same thing, and i braid it when i get out of the shower and then sleep on it and when i take the braids out in the morning, i have really cute waves.    watch these 2 videos, i promise they'll tell you everything you need to know and they will not be a waste of time! :D  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Kq44LfP...      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LijD9gACV...      |`|BGkSeq2Saa	I agree with the advice about the braids but I'd add one suggestion: to make the waves stay pronounced and last longer, apply a flexible-hold gel, spray-gel or styling cream to your damp hair before braiding it.    also, I recommend scunci pillow rollers for *loose* curls. with those it is best to wait until your hair is thoroughly dry. you can brush out your hair afterward for more a more subtle wave but I prefer to finger-comb.
ZT0K3q2Aaa	Yeah, those stores get old. But ive never really liked those stores to begin with|`|rd6eRnzTaa	yes and no. I like there hoodies because they're comfy.;  I wish they has more creative styles then just saying abercrombie on them in different colors.|`|GygOv3dIaa	Totally  Pacsun Kicks Major *** =D!|`|2Yijblbaaa	iworked at hollister for a year. i couldn't agree more.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	same here    Im 20 and i wore a lot in HS but now its getting pretty lame as Im getting older.    Time for older crowd brand|`|0AQF8pnKaa	yes  i think its stupid that if we don't buy there we're like losers or something at school or wherever. i also think its loserish to go there and buy something that says hollister or abercrombie in big blaring letters all over it so everyone knows you paid $30 for a t-shirt. however, i do buy there and i like some of their stuff.|`|7eI0kW5Uaa	hm, yeah ...  but the only store that has clothes i like :/|`|jTsQkuhHaa	i was bored with them before they existed|`|ExL22JZWaa	I dont understand the craze. I love american eagles jeans, but the rest of their clothes.. its the same. I wish I was the person who had thought putting a name or initals on a polo or hoodie would sell to the tweens/teens. Ten bucks there are girls on here that freak out and say we're losers for thinking this..    sorry im not a brain washed girl....|`|LtoQQUKPaa	I agree. The only thing I've ever bought from Abercrombie & Fitch is this tee shirt wiAbsolutelyley no writing or A&F on it..just a plain white tshirt with a pocket. I cant stand all of that distressed writing crap.|`|fZe9UBhoaa	eliza i agree and this is gonna sound weird but do you remember me? abby?
2DMJQ3aRaa	yes. that's what i do. it's not really unhealthy in my case cause i have constipation but since i also want to lose weight without compromising what i eat, i OD myself with laxatives. very effective for me. :)|`|jH8hIB0kaa	The answer is no. They just increase the speed of the waste and dehydrate your body.|`|CuhJRewLaa	im gonna have to go with no|`|JXsLiAJqaa	i dont think so. maybe a natural pill to help u release water weight|`|kyTDQEWaaa	All it does is stimulate the large colon.   Your calories have been absorbed long before it gets turned into poo in your colon.   You might feel lighter for a day, then its back to normal.|`|iRd7DYRLaa	I will add in to agree with the others.  Laxatives don't burn calories.  Perhaps you are beautiful now.  Health is very attractive, I say enjoy what you have.  Counting your blessings is much more satisfying than focusing on the scale.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	No, they will not reduce calories. However, excessive use of them, when they are not needed to keep you regular, can remove essential nutrients before your body can absorb them. This may lead to loss of body mass, but the loss will include muscle and flesh, not fat. It could also lead to other problems, such as lowering of calcium, thus bone problems.
PheCncFwaa	http://www.coach.com/content/product.asp...      i think this one is the cutest|`|2Yijblbaaa	2nd|`|984bfc60ae0a13ac2b2ae06e4e42f640aa	I have the same form bag in a different pattern. It is wayyyyy too small!!! Don't get it! It was a bad deal!|`|nyeUUojFaa	i dont like them, but if its ur style just get them|`|EW1yumzNaa	The second one is better, but i dont personally care for either of them but it is what you like!|`|WvWbTkfPaa	the 2nd one, it's the cutest.|`|Ug59D75laa	2nd.    It will last longer too.  {I'm 13.}|`|ALidyPnXaa	I don't like one, but   I think two is super cute !|`|uHSBIdB1aa	1st one!!!!!!!|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	I have the second one but i think i like the first one better.|`|KDrztUEpaa	I like the first one out of the choices you have, but I like that Coach that "Kristina" has on her answer (on the link) better.|`|5e8cf46067e92dbf7676f55f93f81341aa	the first one. and dont use it everyday for 2-3 years...|`|Bha2LLxAaa	the first one is cute for a thirteen yr. old|`|nyQMDwWYaa	Number 1  (:    But I looove this one,  http://www.coach.com/content/product.asp...|`|ewLQy9fQaa	DEFINITELY THE FIRST ONE!|`|ZA6A2adbaa	the second 1 all the way it is sooo cute, i think im gonna get it 2 :)|`|TN06tKvZaa	both are super cute!!|`|w4ZnIjWWaa	I think they both are cute!  but the 2nd looks like it would last longer, thats the one i would go with!  hope that helped:D:D:D|`|9O5wmECoaa	the first is very cute  matches a lot of colors  :)|`|QuHRliM9aa	I like the second one, it suits a 13 year old better than the first one. It's good also because it isn't to childish.|`|bWGCQYJTaa	i really the second one. the first one is kinda old looking and not cute. the second one looks cuter because it looks more modern and since your 13.. well second one is even more better. im also 13 soo i think i might know what im talking about, but its just my oppinion. :D|`|hdyBoNgJaa	the second one is really cute!|`|BMpcXxrOaa	Neiiithhher, sorry :/  I preferr oversiized buckle bagggs.  something like this. http://store.alloy.com/item.do;jsessioni...  That's my favoorite. doo somethig like that.  or obviously urbanoutfitters has the most amazing bags.  But very expensive.    But if i hadd to choose, the first one.|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Neither of them...they don't look like Coach bags and they're a bit ugly. They are fun, but if you want to make them last (in the style way as well as the durable way), get a classic Coach bag. Those will be out of style in MONTHS.     Like this: http://www.coach.com/content/product.asp...    It's Coach's signature look and totally cute-classy.|`|v64IwD5xaa	they are both very cute...    but i would say ur better off buying the first one if you want to use it for 2-3 years.. bc coach  constantly redoes its designs and stuff.. and the first one is more classic and will probably be around longer.     hope i helped : )|`|pA1UubScaa	i love the 2nd one alot!|`|4KAaCJjZaa	Both are nice.  st day whn u go out choose first one  second day choose second|`|XfNBAbLCaa	1    Simple design=classier.  The other bag will go out of style much quicker.|`|KjI9Wr3Vaa	secondd onee. i likee it a lot better.|`|de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	I prefer the first one.|`|uwg62QBAaa	i agree w/ "Kristina"|`|MI6Ds5lwaa	the 2nd one.
2r5yq35paa	Yes it does.  This is because it get's rid of the hair that falls out and untangle your hair. Brushing your hair also helps the blood flow to the roots, bringing nutrients to the hair follicles, and you'll get healthier hair, and your hair would grow faster.|`|Y6FhzwoAaa	no but it makes the apperance of oily hair.  making it look like you havent washed it in days.  and thats disgusting.  brush it just like when it feels knotty and like in the morning after a shower and before bed and such.      hope i helped(:|`|4lqwMnhJaa	No, brushing your hair a lot actually damages your hair.  If you want your hair to grow more quickly, then try massaging your scalp for five minutes a day because that increases blood flow to your scalp which helps with hair growth. Best tip: be patient :)|`|ALidyPnXaa	Nope.  There are some shampoos though, that   strengthen your hair, which helps it grow,  but brushing does nothing =0  Hope I helped a bit =)|`|f6fCixDnaa	No offence but i get frustrated with people who think trimming, brushing, cutting, moisturising helps with hair growth.    We get hair-regrowth at our scalp..why? because it grows from our scalp not from the bottom. Only your diet can aid hair growth because hair is made under the skin.   Trimming and cutting is a myth..it only snips dead ends so they dont break and go shorter..they dont make it faster or better..    Consider buying a vitamin supplement "Hair, Skin and Nails" most vitamin brands sell this. Its your best bet..    ~Naomi~|`|2KMYz3Rjaa	nope. does absolutely nothing...it is a myth...    hair only grows a designated amount a month, there isn't anything that can be done to change that unfortunately...      More proof since others told you the wrong answer:    The only proven way to grow hair faster is pregnancy. There are things you could be doing that make your hair grow slower (like bad nutrition, vitamin deficiency, chemicals, sedentary lifestyle, etc), but people who are in generally good health will not increase the rate of growth outside of pregnancy. Anyone who tells you differently is lying or misinformed.

XLRx5decaa	Okay, I've only tried Benefit's Badgal (in the mini tube), and I do not recommend you get it. The brush is a hassle because it's just too big! The bristles get everywhere BUT your lashes, so all I end up with is a mess of mascara on my eye lid. Also, it looks very natural. You can hardly tell you have mascara on at all. This isn't a bad thing, but it's not what you're looking for. I know this is random and out of no where, but why do they call it badgal when all you get is natural "good girl" lashes? I don't get it.    Anyway, to sum it up: badgal in the minitube isn't worth the money. A good mascara if you want natural results though.|`|ZdNhdeVYaa	well if you have short eyelashes use the bad gal... and if you have long lashes already to begin with use big fatty :)|`|imjKIG9Iaa	Urban Decays Big Fatty Mascara (in a mini tube)|`|MDyV9HKJaa	urban decay definatly!!|`|bHMPolh1aa	um, why wouldn't you want natural-looking mascara? do you want your lashes looking clumpy and fake?|`|kknSPYxKaa	Urban Decay's.|`|SwOQjBZNaa	I can't use anything BUT Benefit.  Really I've tried, and I just can't.  Every single color of it is fantastic as well, but I just own black and go to the store to use the colors for special occasions. ;]    Definitely go with Benefit BADgal!|`|genZbG74aa	Benefit BADgal. urban decay big fatty mascara is clumpy. read reviews on the sephora website, it really helps
jbTsULoUaa	I use L'oreal Kids and it works but I think I'm growing out of it.. and I've heard a lot of good things from Herbal Essences. But also bad things. But worse things about Pantene. I've used it once, it made my hair really strong and thick for some reason, my mom doesn't let me use it because she says it's more for grown ups, but the conditioner she says would be okay. I asked a question on Herbal Essences so I'll get back to you on that ;)|`|OiXap6ucaa	I used Herbal Essences for a long time, but now I think Dove is best. It puts lots of moisture and keeps hair smooth. I suggest u Dove. God bless.|`|O9VW6RjEaa	Mane N Tail Shampoo & Conditioner  Organix Shampoo & Conditioner  Both can be found at drugstores or grocery stores (I think) at prices way lower that $45.|`|CcXIbqnOaa	I used to have terribly frizzy and curly hair. I like Dove or Pantene products. Make sure you get something to put in it afterward though, like a gel or mousse. That's what makes all the difference.|`|CZAQs5zmaa	pantine is the best no matter what. it has all different kinds for all kinda hair.|`|0SoglbRUaa	you should use herbal essence.  it smells great and works really well. they have it for other kinds of hairr like frizzy, or thin, or other stuff like that.  they have sprays too!!!!!

26d3xsUNaa	i don't know i think you should go to a doctor that treats skin problems or you could ask the people that put it on for you if they have any suggestions.|`|QePbhS8Caa	The skin under hair is usually lighter because it has not been exposed to the elements. You're just going to have to give it time. Try using a little eyeshadow to cover.|`|y46ZQItQaa	Its your first time huh ?    i just  got mine waxed yesterday , and its because your not used to it . trust me , mine are too . but i try not to look at it too much.|`|pDAapTvDaa	it is because the rest of the hair on your face is darker not your skin.|`|EvMZJ6eyaa	I had the same problem. Its because that part of your skin hasn't really seen the sun so it isn't tanned. It will work eventually.|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	Try using a spray tanner or something, but just on that area. Get gloves (so your fingers aren't crazy orange) and put a little on your fingers and then rub it on, but just a little.|`|jnW1hEWJaa	i have another question.  Are you greek?  i knew some eight year old greek women with unibrows like u'd never believe.|`|tjEG8dxwaa	I think you should tell the salon that you got them done from and she if they have any suggestions.

Depends on how big you gauge it, it may impair your speech.   Allergic reaction could happen  People look at you strangely when you get bored and play with it.  Old people think your nuts.  Everyone that does not have one asks you if it hurt when you got it done.   Fun to take it out and squirt water through it.   Leaves a tiny scar, if you decide to take it out.
q8zxfL5Jaa	you look like an average gal  i think you should use eyeliner, eyeshadow(purple, blue), and mascara cuz you have gorgeous eyes and they NEED attention!  and for lipgloss, wear a glossy baby pink colour  and finally straighten your hair! you'd look way better:)  you look about 13 or 14.|`|blwDnJy4aa	Yes    Lose any semblence of a fake tan.  Don't use too much make up.  Your hair is great, btw.|`|972LCOk4aa	i think your 15 and a half  go easy on the makeup, a natural look would be perfect for you. straight your hair sometimes maybe.  your really pretty :)|`|SYbr3RM9aa	you look about my age  so like 14 or 15ish     (:    oh and i really like your hair!|`|6d366995788df4d6f45713e15e220860aa	16-18.    no lie.  your pretty too!|`|RUvQtskcaa	go natural but wear a light red lip stick. it would really make you look cool! in europe they do that- wear no makeup, but then have bright lips. it is very pretty|`|3iB7bnJGaa	less make-up  you look about 13 but the makeup makes you like your are trying to look wayyy older|`|CZfUO2kcaa	You are very pretty. I don't go for dark eyeliner all along the bottom of eyes, though I know that is the style. I'd say you are between 12 and 13. I think that the lip gloss is great.

Subtle is best.
tVVLtMHGaa	If you bought it at best buy it's real. Fake's are illegal to make, sell, and buy. So Best Buy wouldn't sell you a fake. But if you still don't believe me, take it to a store where you know they sell real dooneys and ask them. They will tell you the same thing I just did.|`|hi2nQNXsaa	the serial   on the inside the suede lining and the duck emblem hanging on the strap.|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	You purchased a Doony at best buy?

7e80152bdb8d8318404698c1b63f95c1aa	wow for the people who are calling grinding unclassy lol. its just dancing how else would anyone dance besides slow dancing!! wellll um i would say just dont look nervous and just go with the music|`|Q101YVPgaa	grindings trashy.|`|AA10451072	At my school, not many of the couples grind..      I'd stick to slow-dancing.|`|uOtZUzNOaa	maybe you should try acting classy..and not grinding with your boyfriend at a dance?  people who grind up on eachother should get kicked out.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	Whats wrong with people these days? No one knows how to dance, so they dry hump instead???  Sick. Totally sick. -.-|`|iXWXllhQaa	...    if it's your first time to a high school dance, then i should tell you this:  not everyone grinds.    you still can dance with your boyfriend provocatively in other ways if you really must.    i mean, grinding is really just dry sex, in my opinion. you're rubbing your butt on someone else's genitals. and the guy is enjoying it.     so, good luck.
hgEHJhAqaa	on the box, they are saying if u had black hair because ur supposed to lighten it before so if u lighten your hair from black, then it will work...thats what there saying|`|bHMPolh1aa	well, i go to sally's beauty supply and they have the dye for DARK HAIR. just ask the lady and she'll show it to you. it works great (especially the bright red! :)|`|vGWD8Zncaa	Why would you wish to lighten dark brown hair?    Natural dark brown hair is BEAUTIFUL!    Too many women lighten it.  It only makes it lose some of its natural intensity and appeal.|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	I think you should lighten it first, because you can't lighten your hair unless it has bleach, so the box might have been a false advertisement.|`|LFpcwGwGaa	You could have done it wrong or your hair didn't absorb the color, I tried to get my hair medium brown but i have dark brown/black hair and it made everything below my scalp brown.|`|BAkfz657aa	the reason your roots worked better is called hot roots- its because you have less color on your roots so they lift bettter. those boxes usually work best on virgin hair otherwise you have to bleach first then put the brown on|`|28757f2f4e0a16804280db63ee65d074aa	You probably did wrong. or maybe it just didnt work on your texture of hair.

2ja54L20aa	My dear... don't pay attention to what anyone else is saying. They are all wrong.     This style is brilliant, and I'm realllyyy excited that the west coast look is beginning to become popular all around the country. Working in fashion, I know this style is bigggg for summer '09.     I don't know what your price range is, so I'm going to give you lots of options:  store.americanapparel.net  urbanoutfitters.com  80spurple.com  threadless.com (cool tee's)  alternative apparel  forever21.com (trust me, they sell mens stuff...)    also try some resale/vintage shops for the retro look  rayban wayfarers ^^    Good luckkk! I absolutely love this look for women too... the sort of grungy chic hippy awesome look. it's awesome.|`|JZMfUDylaa	I think it looks a little fruity sorry pal just being honest|`|lML34aM2aa	wow that's absolutly hot. dress like that!!! girls will definitly go for that!!........................... i would!|`|900efdcfb4dda14a388b0b8d1be0e13aaa	no offence at all, i'm just giving my oppinion.  i dont really like the look :\      try abercrombie and hollister.  all of their clothes look good on guys. i promise!|`|d08430e598590d8554dc748d5d4c5293aa	how about express (men's), patagonia (for a sporty, causal, surfer style). i like the outfit he is wearing, but it does look sort of gay. but good luck finding the clothes! oh, btw. patagonia is FABULOUS quality, and many of their clothes are from environmentally friendly/organic materials. Buy a pair of aviator sunglasses (if the style suits your face) and you will be ready to roll! Prada makes some nifty sunglasses, but if that is out of your budget, then go to wal mart! Abercrombie and Birkinstock might have the shoes that you are looking for. Patagonia has neat shoes. Also, Old Navy has some great looking flip flops, but BEWARE: they fall apart within about a week!|`|fzBURqePaa	PacSun would be my best try, Hollister and American Eagle too.    ehh its alright, dpends on the girls but to me, looks dont matter.|`|oFIU6xOQaa	it depends on what kind of girl your trying to attract. and where you live. the clothes that guy is wearing is nyc style. and thats where i live. so i loove that style for guys :]]    pacsun (ish)  american apparel   express   The Gap|`|thzVWG1waa	well, i don't care  for the deep v-neck shirt much  but  you can get that style from american eagle, they have the sweater type "jackets"  and you could go to target or somewhere cheap for just a tee      personally i like straight leg worn wash denim jeans slightly sagged, and a t-shirt or a hoodie    i find that style almost too laid back on a man, looks like he is on permanent vacation!  lol  :D  whatever you do i'm sure it will look great!|`|xvqhiUhBaa	ehhh not relly likes the skinny jeans with the shoes.  k get skinny jeans cuz guys in skinnys are hott,haha.  but with convrse's for shoes.  and not the v crew neck line for the shrit more like the regular shrits.  google stores like pac sun.  and btw hers som store you could try.  hot topic  zumiez  pacsun uhhh yeah haha.|`|M9DWMQijaa	Try PacSun|`|57mE02q3aa	go to Hollywood lol|`|6f3f6d718fae9cac71e77cc6c1c1c47daa	i think it's cute.    americanapparel.com    altamont.com|`|TInnKng3aa	The style is...just a no, no.  Guys should be careful when wearing skinny jeans because they can make you look bulky or too skater punkish.  Relaxed jeans look nice not too tight or too baggy. (just right)  and also as far a shirts- t-shirts look good (especially if they have a nice design on them or a message like--to write love on her arms) but warning  if you are 5'7 and slender don't pick up a x-large shirt, there is no need to be drowning in fabric. If you get a shirt that is your size (should not go past the the button on your pants!) it makes you look well put together. Polo's look nice too.  If your going for a little sophistication--one suit jacket to through over a t-shirt and some black pants would do nicely!  Shoes-Vans and Converse will always do you well.    Hope this helped!|`|meacW8jQaa	guy looks so gay...  are you gay?|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	i like the girls style... not the guys he would kinda look gay if he wasnt with a girl around his arm|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	I don't like it that much well the outfit okay, the guy is ugly lol.|`|1suIEET4aa	ok personally i think that looks pretty gay,but thats just me the  style i like for a guy is like way diffrent.a bit more manly.so ya just tellin you.you can find the skinny jeans at pac sun and i dont know go to american eagle or somewhere for the shirt.|`|k7jInxBXaa	pac sun   hot topic

I personally won't because hell i can't even walk in shoes like those imagine trying to dance in them...|`|fjkRIUSnaa	OMG YES I WOULD WEAR THOSE THEY ARE AWESOME|`|781wxmjMaa	ha ha you should spend a little more money on your wife to be shoes ... to me there a little dull....http://www.chanel.com/fashion/8-shoes-ch... try those :)|`|t4cJy368aa	It looks more for the wedding ceremony when you change out of your wedding dress into another dress.
sF6hU1Zpaa	Okay, more than half of the people I know are B's.. so don't worry.  I'm a C, and I have a a big butt.. but I think the reason why guys prefer boobs is because you can "do" more with them.. This guy that likesme loves to text me and tell me stuff that he wants to do to my boobs.  Don't know why. lol. butts are just weird when you think about it becaubecause waste comes out of them.
3e85ef07522da788e8a2199e8114a8b2aa	yes it is. very expensive|`|2ja54L20aa	In about 2007, Guess made a new business concept, an affordable brand, that was meant to appeal to the same young teens who shop at Abercrombie, Hollister, etc. The prices are similar to those of Express, American Eagle, and Gap. The introduction of this CHEAPER section of the company basically replaced the factory outlet websites... soo... assumptions can be made that G by Guess is in actuality just the crap that wouldn't sell.    Therefore, if you consider companies along the lines of American Eagle, Gap, and Hollister to be designer, then you are deranged and very, very wrong. All though it is less naive to call G by Guess a "low, low, low end designer" it is most definitely not amongst the respected designers (Louis Vuitton, Chanel, etc)    So, no. G by Guess is not a designer store.   It is a store. Nothing more.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	you just answered your own answer.  guess isn't technically even a "designer" brand, it's just well known.  everyone has different interpretations.    designer in the "fashion" world is "technically"  chanel, fendi, prada, LV etc.  high end fashion pretty much|`|RGSSYFPyaa	lmao yah|`|sJs3rMjyaa	yea|`|VXaKIFVLaa	haha yea it still is !! i love that store too|`|JHBeBZMGaa	yes it is.i just bought a jacket out of there the other day
Ivgd8sSCaa	Hmm you picked a hard one. Italy does not have a signature dress that when you see it you think 'italy' . If you want to dress more roman themed, wear dresses like this  http://www.edupics.com/phpThumb/cache/1/...    http://www.fibre2fashion.com/_resources/...    Good luck! I 
c4ZkcK6waa	Yes. IF U WANT TO RUIN UR FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HwujORd2aa	It looks great on everyone with hair like yours!  Keep those long bangs and go for the chop.  I bet you'll love it.|`|LC9M7zkSaa	I don't think a bob would do your face justice. Maybe a side bang instead.|`|6OWdI5dzaa	no, that wouldn't look right. your face is shaped like mine, and i've tried an angled bob, it doesn't look good. you should grow your hair a bit longer, and get layers around your face, and trim your bangs a little. that'd look cute      like this maybe?    http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/d/f/asia...
CuhJRewLaa	blonde pale and blue-eyed?    dont do it|`|lHCZUPm2aa	Don't play into an image. Try something a little more classic. But if you're dead set on it, then yeah it will probably look fine. But be warned; dying blonde hair black takes a LOT of retouching. So be prepared to invest the time and money.|`|oSAPrV8jaa	yes..it would make u look more mature and out going..    goodluck=]]|`|YSmzoEqKaa	o definitely like that would look awesome if your going for like a horror film actress or 'emo'  type look but if not ...i wouldnt recommend it lol but it sounds like it would look good on you to me neways...and dont care what other ppl think about it all in all its ur decision choose what will make you happiest :)|`|lU4uBYcuaa	No, keep it dirty blonde and in the bob! It wont look very good emo style! That's gross.|`|HoqbrYYxaa	EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!! THE ONLY WAY THAT GOOD IS OF YOU ARE A PUNK SPAZ OR WANT TO BE A VAMPIRE!

It feels kind of tingly, but then within five minutes your lips are plumper than before.
BGkSeq2Saa	obviously there are no online thrift stores, and hot topic is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced unless the item is in clearance.    the problem with buying (new) clothes for cheap, online or not, is that you tend to get what you pay for in quality.

1TnS510Caa	I think you are really pretty.So I would say about a nine.I don't think you should go heavy on the makeup,but I think a little lip gloss,some blush, and a bit of eyeshadow would go a long way.You look exactly sixteen, so you look your age.I really love your hair.It looks so natural.|`|aRBF37Qpaa	ur very pretty  no homo  u kinda reminded me of,,, me lol idk why haha  i think it's the face shape or sumthin idk,,, oh well|`|wImYypazaa	5 or 6  A lil below average, but it's probably just the angle|`|kIGOGKXYaa	5|`|oQaQkkJcaa	i think your very cute.. hmm a number doesnt seem quite right, nor does answering this question since im 19, but anyway.  and to the guy that said your plain looking?  thats ridiculous.  nobody looks 'plain'.  its all a matter of preference.|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	ew, you look like this stuck up girl amanda.

wu2NyhCVaa	Definately keep straightening it, and get your hair cut with a side part and a fringe over one eye, also maybe ask your parents if they will let you put one of those colours that wash out in 8 washes, argue that it isn't permanent, and perhaps use it as a reward for doing house chores or something, then maybe they will let you keep applying it when it washes out, good luck :)|`|pcSe793Naa	well emo kid, you could cut yourself sorry I mean cut it youself.|`|AA11433347	straighten it and then pull the bangs to one side so it is covering one of your eyes..good luck|`|ilt8pNFWaa	dye it black, or peroxide blonde, flat, long, and a lip ring.|`|4iirhaECaa	Emo?

3f66cc3efb53199d2d83a6e93be1b534aa	Women and men can get good jobs by just being physically beautiful and having a degree with no work experience.    If a woman is built better than normal and good looking with a degree, she can land a good job.  If a man is of good stature and he has a deep voice with a degree, he can land a good job.  Unfortunately, being good looking or having a fit body with a book knowledge degree doesn't mean that you are the best person for the job.  There are average looking men and single mothers that work on the assembly floor making $8.50 an hour and can't afford a degree that have much more experience and knowledge about a job that pays 60K a year than a beautiful person with book knowledge.  Beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but it is in life and work experiences.  I feel good and confident about myself and my life.  I am 48 and ten pounds overweight and make 35K a year but I own my own house and have a good family life.  I am happy.  I guess it all comes down to self esteem and what you NEED out of life.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	are we talking self-imposed beauty or natural beauty. natuarl beauty is beauty without making yourself look better. that has nothing to do with being smart. and making your self look better usually just has to do with good hygine and some fashion sense. and i know people who are extremly dumb and can still make themselves look better by wearing certain cloths and make-up. so i would say no. brains and bueaty are seperate.|`|O34eIRsIaa	"If you think about it the people who are smart will try to perfect their body or mind."

fcIzDGnBaa	Natural - it's easy to take care of. Acrylic will ruin you real nails. Not really sure about silk wraps though.|`|k7jInxBXaa	natural because then I won't have to deal with gettiny nails done too often|`|lYjLrqzOaa	I have tried all types of nails and at the present I prefer the natural nails. However, if I had a special occasion to go to I would consider getting them done professionally.     In my opinion:    The most important thing about any artificial nails is the process used to apply them. So keep this in mind and read article below:    Since there are so many variables when it comes to gel nails, acrylic nails, natural nails and everything in between that your best bet is always to go to a trusted tail technician.     Ask your friends who they use or call the Better Business Bureau before going to a shop. Sometimes the only difference between gel and acrylic is how theyve been applied, so you want to hire a professional you can trust..     Have FUN at the wedding!

Well Best Wishes|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Google it!      http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=40+...|`|jez0O0bXaa	That is for bleach or hi-lift dyes.  For bleach you mix it with the bleach powder until a pudding consistency.  For hi-lift dyes mix equal parts. Do not use it with a dye that is equal to or darker than your natural hair level. 40 volume is meant to lift the color pigment out of your hair. Good Luck!
qjutViNuaa	if you really want scene hair you can just ask for really choppy layers and for the color thing you can just go to hot topic and get some of those $6 ( i think) extensions. you  can wash and straighten them    http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_sXI8Dr0DFV0/Ro...    http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc290...|`|JwdU9nVBaa	http://media.photobucket.com/image/layer...    http://www.myemohairstyles.com/gallery/f...    http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc290...    its not really "scene" considering you cant dye it or have it too choppy but, it works.|`|JJgjxa8Haa	hold on I'll try to find you one    [EDIT]  http://s287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137...  http://www.scene-hair.net/wp-content/upl...  http://www.myemohairstyles.com/gallery/f...  http://s287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137...  http://s287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137...|`|d5ppt4jFaa	http://media.photobucket.com/image/scene...     you should just get your bangs done a bit choppy and let your hair grow long and if your impatient you can find hair extensions :]|`|7zoRxC49aa	i have scene hair, extentions and 4 coon stripes  consider buying pre bonded or clip in extentions  teasing you hair will be difficult if your layers 2 long but you will need to do a hell alot of teasing and hairspray    this is a good vid on how to put them in and tease your scene hair    i love scene hair ! have fun with it!!    http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=y7JxyMtsf8...
AA11151670	Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on.  Down on the corner, by the Traffic light, people are staring, as she walks by. She just strolls on like a rolling stone. Heaven help us baby's got her blue jeans on.|`|igrdohopaa	Not really. its like plain|`|tbYtlBh6aa	Yes, they look really nice.|`|iEdubUyzaa	yea, i like all skinny jeans, unless the crotch is too low, ya kno?  i like tight fitting jeanss that arent too baggy|`|0SoglbRUaa	i think that you should get them darker.  the darker ones are in now!!! and wear some flats or converse with them.  it will be cool!
CcXIbqnOaa	Yes, I believe most of them cover up shoulder blades all the way.|`|xvqhiUhBaa	nooooooo,hahah.  there like a inch,like regular ones theres alot,but the ones for little kids cover your sgolder place they can be found at the childrens place,and the ones that are a inch,made for teens,can be found at pacsun,and other stores.
6zeRfL8Xaa	i like American Eagle better because they have better prices so u can get more stuff and Hollister just pretty much has different colored t-shirts with Hollister on them in different letters for like twice the price of something at American Eagle|`|jYKPvZxWaa	hollister is overrated|`|UhuApRO8aa	Honestly I like American Eagle better. There both nice stores. As you know, at brand name stores like Hollister & American Eagle, there clothes are yet very thin. Two other stores I like (Brand name) is Aeropostale & Abercombie & Fitch. I found good deals at both stores. Good luck with what you chose!|`|tv7anaBDaa	WHY DOES IT MATTER IF MORE PEOPLE SHOP AT ONE PLACE THAN ANOTHER OR WEAR IT MORE THAT ANOTHER.     what do you like better. dont ask someone else what they think is better it's your opinion. I say they both are stupid. Everything they sell is just a moving billboard. Go into any of those 2 stores and everything there says there stores name on it. Like what are you representing. Like i wear musicT- Shirts cause it represents who i am and what i listen to what does the store's logo represent. to go to the store and buy a shirt or jaket that says the stores name. the store name has no meaning accept that its a store to buy things with the stores name.I't like going to target and buying a shirt that says target. NO POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fCKFqXN8aa	I think that American Eagle is better.  First off they are cheaper and they last just as long.  Wearing Hollister makes you look like you are trying to be preppy and trying to fit in.  But american eagle it is suttle and you look just as good.|`|KBCFVZVNaa	American Eagle|`|4lqwMnhJaa	I don't like Hollister at all because of the darkness which makes everything hard to see, the rude employees, and the cheap fabric.  So out of those two, I would pick American Eagle. They have pretty good jeans too.|`|GykCnbR7aa	i luv both so i can't pick|`|7PYHwSONaa	its really just a matter of opinion  but most people would say hollister because its more expensive and has a larger variety of clothes and personally i think there stuff it cuter.. but i still love american eagle.|`|J3HKl0Hqaa	Hollister, cuter clothes, better music and perfume too. & only awesome peoples where it|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	Right now, Hollister is more popular because more and more people are wearing their stuff. As for American Eagle they've always been there so, it's not as new.|`|SCTMtrjhaa	They are both great! I wear both, a lot! AE has more of a different variety of shirts, like different styles and all that stuff. HCO is mostly logo tees, in different colors!|`|2fzjIuTIaa	Where im at Hollister is more popular but i prefer American Ealge it actually has what u can call "style" not just shirts with the name of the company on them, and their's a better variety of clothing.|`|s75GfCGeaa	hollister is more popular,  american eagle has better quality.|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	I like Hollister better. Of all the clothes I've worn and seen.....Hollister is better. Hope this helped!|`|0SoglbRUaa	i think holliser is better. american eagle is great too. they have some good deals.  their clothes have more variety but yet they have log tees and the same thing as hollister. hollister has polos, tanks, tees etc.  so they are both good. have funnnnn|`|I9SPul34aa	I think Hollister is more popular among teens than American Eagle...they're both cute, but Hollister is usually a little cheaper and they always have a lot more on sale, and it fits better.    It seems like there's always about an even number of people shopping in both stores, but at school, more kids wear Hollister.    =]|`|oSDppSwVaa	i see more people wearing hollister, but i really like them both. i do like hollister a little bit more because it has more of a california feel to it. i live in michigan andd it fun to like dress differently than how the climate is here. :)|`|yqXx4vaOaa	I like neither stores but if I had to pick one I'd say American Eagle|`|t4cJy368aa	None.
AA10745960	take like a razor (like you would use to shave your legs)      or    use sand paper|`|D4JP3IlWaa	okay this is what i dooo. lol  put the jeans you want to rip on. then get one of those compasses that comes in the math set and with the pointy needle part keep scratching your jeans horizontally. it might take a while or you might have a few scratches on your leg but it workss =) well it does for me anyways!  good luck!|`|W1vdfn1yaa	sandpaper. it'll take awhile but it should come out like that|`|Ug59D75laa	Okay:    Start running on really rocky concrete turn to the side you want the rips & trip and fall. (:    lol jk.      I'm not sure, good luck.|`|nyeUUojFaa	yeh sandpaper works, but its a bit tedious.|`|3dHn4gQraa	i havent trieed this yet but i heard if you use your chees grader and grade your jeans it created the distressed look and if you want holes just slightly rip the worn down denim

(I like Garnier Fructis products myself).<br>  don't go blonde, I don't like the look of girls like us with dark brown eyes and then have blonde hair I think it looks trashy. and it wouldn't compliment your skin tone at all. a dark auburn would look great on you. and the bangs would accentuate your pretty brown eyes|`|41055ae0e3e48e9a0e089b2b1828b112aa	I like it slightly curled as the totally straight style is starting to go out now. If you get some hair mousse and just literally 'scrunch' it as the bed-head-messy look is coming in right now.<br>  good luck x|`|QwHLZaS6aa	You and your hair is soo pretty!  maybe get a darker brown, or darker lowlights?  Maybe layers but i really like it now!|`|d5t5XgfVaa	dye it a darker color or even go blonde;]|`|FNdsPNrJaa	you just need to mess with it! the wet natural was b-e-a-utiful!! I honestly think you should just get some highlights and curl ( i mean really curl like volume and everything) it! Like some of the stars are doing today? Straight  but curly at the bottom!! Very classy and would look so very good on you ;) Also dont do the straight look again with out fluffing it on top...idk if you know what I mean but its like plastered to your head and doesnt do anything for you. Like take your fingers to the roots and shake em ...then straighten it out lightly. Good luck! <3|`|2bC0dvPKaa	I'd say cut it shoulder-length, give it layers and a bit more volume, and make your bangs shorter, just over the eyebrow. (like this: <a href="http://styletips101.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bangs.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://styletips101.com/wp-content/uploa...</a> See if you can give your hair more volume most of all.

I really like the 3rd picture.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down for a compliment...|`|bOB6PZscaa	I really like your hair straight :D so i would straighten it but add more volume to it <br>  i like herbal essences volume and uplift shampoo and conditioner then dry your hair upside down :D <br>  it helps a lot  =]|`|LLYlQcakaa	your hair is very pretty, but i would advice you should dye your hair, maybe dirty blonde colour, or just add a lil hihgliths :)<br>  <br>  or get a cut and laired a lot :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped...|`|W5ra5LQRaa	it wuld look cute if u either died it a dirty blond or get it red....hope i helped and if u asked ppl to rate u i wuld give u a 8/10!!<br>  ~Jai|`|dcQPpXlwaa	oo dye ur hair.. to almost a rusty reddish color that would look so sexy on u omgsh lol... and get ur hair trimmed a lil and get a volumizer for ur hair..|`|BdafX7Staa	it look fine just the way it is umm.. i would die to have ur hair!!!!|`|FwLGBWataa	There is a site i use called www.taaz.com<br>  You can upload a pic of yourself and try out different hairstyles.

Or crimping it?|`|p9v6NXMPaa	carmal or redish highlights|`|3Y6oROG4aa	your really pretty....you look the best straightend with it and you would look really good with spiral curls in your hair maybe put some highlight's in your hair also|`|BO28Mn8haa	I think you look the best in the wet hair. And because wet hair always looks darker, I think your best bet is to get a color slightly darker. A mocha brown. And use some hair serum. Super cute. You're adorable.
zMYYow55aa	try forever 21. they arent really scater, but the have variety of sizes and stuff. they are cheep 2!
Hs3HjbMbaa	any unscented lotion is just as good, like Jergens or something, has to be unscented though, or it will get irritated...|`|4qPsEQFlaa	Aw man girl, that sucks! But I would use the butt paste. Its basically the same thing as A+D ointment. A+D is also for diaper rash so i dont see why that would hurt it. Call the person that did the tat in the AM!    You cant use lotion on a new tattoo btw.    And the person that said "only insecure people get tattoos", is stupid and mean.|`|W8E1dcfgaa	get a car.|`|r2QIbmPIaa	vasaline|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Any kind of unscented goo would work at this point, as long as its not neosporin or vaseline. Unscented lotion would also work well, some people have used this with good results. I have always used A&D on my tattoos.|`|CqVm9Y5faa	ya im pretty sure a+d is the best stuff for it and only stuff. and if that **** scabs not only is it gonna hurt like a ***** but he will have to get it redone
8uaiAQSsaa	Pencil always smudged for me too. I only use their cream liner now and it works great. I use it on my water line; the navy seems to stay on best for me but I love the teal. If you still smudge try putting on concealer where you want your eyeliner first, let it dry, then put on your eye liner. It stops most of the smudging.    Hope I helped!|`|qOKFuXfLaa	no, I would advise you not to put liquid liner, or gel liner on your waterline. Unfortunately, you need to stick to pencils when it comes to your waterline.  you can however, use a pencil on your lower lash line, that doesn't smear and won't give you the racoon eye effect. I hate usng liner on my waterline for the racoon eye reason and the fact that i get black eye buggers.      gel liners and liquid liners can be very dangerous to the eye.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	I've used it and loved it on my waterline. Never had anything that lasted so long, but if you have any concerns, I really like Urban Decay's 24/7 Glide on Pencil and you can even set it with an eyeshadow to make it stay longer. That works well too. Good luck!|`|0cSyDWxzaa	No don't use a creame eyeliner in your waterline.  That eyeliner works really good for the upper and lower lid though. Just not inside the eye.   Try using a waterproof pencil eyeliner since all your others smear.  I like Urban Decay 24/7 glide on eyeliner or something like that.  You can get it at ulta or sephora, it's about $16 but stays on forever. And they have it in a bunch of different colors.|`|mFhMX9qRaa	never tried it.   and i use the regular maybelline liquid eyeliner :)  stays on great!

Q9hlyggRaa	ive always thought men looked beautiful with long hair if you have hair then you should let it grow my son still has long hair and he's in his late 30's he would never cut it off for nothing or no one. and no the hippie thing will never be over i still see young people still looking and dressing the same way they did in the 60's.|`|YB63U3Pgaa	looking for game......... such a nice way of putting it!!!,  but i wont go further into that.<br>  <br>  Personally for me i hate long hair on a guy just puts me off straight away, and the pot things i'd not touch you with a bargepole.  But then i suppose it's what age group you want to attract ( hopefully at least legal) For me i'm well past the age of going out getting as pissed as possible, and having a few drags of a spliff. <br>  <br>  Have you ever thought that your dry spell is because girls are maybe feb up of just being used for a 1 night stand maybe there getting smarted and catching on, and the reason your not getting much "action" is because you've been around the block that many times the one that are happy for a 1 night stand have all ready been there and done you!!!!|`|ddXQeEvNaa	personally, i like long. but it has to be really long. like, if it's not past your shoulders it's just annoying. but i'm a little punk.|`|TwUAgoxeaa	SHORT.  I can't stand long hair on a dude.|`|JyGFPMPqaa	short looks nice and clean and long looks like a hippie and like u dont care about life.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	Short! Short! Short!

t8utvEZIaa	I tried that on in topshop the other day! haha<br>  <br>  its really nice, and has a nice fit... except if you have a long body, i should warn you it is quite short.

o1BL1zA9aa	...Only the "Scene Queens" you tend to see on the internet are really tiny. They tend to be anorexic too... Like the girl who answered ahead of me, they are often seen on thinspo sights.     Scene chicks are not "always so petite." I know a lot of chubby ones. I myself am at an average weight for my height, despite being considered "scene" by many people.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	They probably don't eat or if they do eat, they eat lots of vegan foods.|`|354a5c904225797c94e05876cf0c8196aa	same way a prep does|`|CuhJRewLaa	good old fashoned vomiting|`|sZUNC9Ghaa	they eat healthy foods i guess! or they go on a fast. im not saying scene girls do that! so dont get offended! im just taking a guess! or they vomit....the option i would never ever do!|`|lxYWZc9caa	Anorexia  Bulimia  Laxatives|`|iEdubUyzaa	i see a lot of heavy scene girls. it has nothing to do with being scene lolz. im skinny...i eat healthy and stay fit.  short and sweet lolz|`|5bdef4b7a169cd4330af920dfcb3c52caa	alot of them have eating disorders. not to generalize but if u look up thinspiration photos, alot of them are scene girls.   thinspo are the pictures girls with eating disorders use as inspiration.|`|BE6v12pmaa	They hate eating-binges!!!!

It might seem like a while, but it would look natural since it's over a long period of time-    I know that my blonde-haired friend used a shampoo for brunettes because it smelled good, and after a few months her hair was very, very dark.|`|t4cJy368aa	Salt water. Just let it soak. You don't necessarily need to be in the sun, just apply it on your hair at night before you go to sleep.
vGWD8Zncaa	My favorite hair colors, from most favorite to least favorite:    Natural dark brown / black  Medium to dark red (natural of course)  Medium-dark brown (natural)  Medium red (natural)  Dyed dark red  Dyed dark brown or black  Bright red (natual)  Strawberry blonde (natural)  Strawberry blonde (with red added)  Carmel (highlighted from a darker color)  Blonde bleached from a light brown or darker blonde  Natural blonde  Bleached blonde (from a darker color) - eww!    Frankly, the "punk" colors like pink, dark green, blue and purple are MUCH more interesting than bleached blonde hair or bleached blonde highlights.  At least those colors are interesting and not overdone.|`|MBPR4PX5aa	http://s122.photobucket.com/albums/o256/...    purple..|`|dDsoZ98Oaa	my hair is dark brown, i personally love light/medium brown hair with blonde highlights, LOOKS HOTT! =]|`|VSylTdNqaa	I have light brown hair. my fav hair colour is brown hair with chestnut highlights!

Bangs could work with that style and you could keep some but not all of the length.
Dk7MgYAkaa	It works really well. My face didn't peel at all. If you have REALLY bad acne I suggest askling for Tazorac. Now that is the stuff to get rid of acne! Make sure you wear sunscreen!!
dDsoZ98Oaa	if you need help with like certain things go on youtube they have demonstrations of EVERYTHING, it's crazy! Like putting in a zipper, etc.. but yeah i personally LOVE making clothes, the best way is to look in a magazine ( i like teen vogue the best ) and make your own version of it, thats right for YOU. without spending the crazy prices.  Also i would reccommend not spending loads on the fabric because you could mess up and it does add up! Wal Mart has the cheapest fabrics when they are on sale, much cheaper than all the fabric stores for some reason... best of luck!
IwaaSQZcaa	Mine do that too, especially because it's winter. I wear 'brikenstocks' and when walking outside the wet snow and dirt get into my shoes/socks/feet. So the dirt stays on. Typical :)|`|rd6eRnzTaa	either a.) you're dirty.  or b.) you're dirty.|`|UYb4ZcSyaa	Wash your feet.|`|6KsIsFbaaa	its dirt from your feet  you cant prevent the stains  just buy new ones every season    thats what i do
DzLX1ophaa	Most shampoos strip the hair's natural oils, I have tried biosilk, hempz, Paul mitchell, you do feel a difference with them, they're more expensive though...    I suggest trying them if your hair is really damaged, but if it is just a little dry just make sure you use conditioner, specially in the ends of the hair, and you can also try hair treatments every week and your hair is going to be fine...|`|L7ToWJdNaa	no it helps and soothes my hair + it makes it shiny. believe what u wanna believe all i no is that its wonderful  =P|`|zgsXo2KWaa	I love lovee it! it really does make your hair smooth! and it really gives it volume!|`|dQHAbgONaa	Herbal Essence is the greatest.

DPMNSzQsaa	straightened hair does tend to be easier to handle as opposed to natural hair. Also, there are popular styles that only look good on straight hair. And lastly, its in fashion these days. The days that you were talking about when black women let their hair go natural were the same days when those with "white" or straight hair were getting curly perms and teasing and hairspraying their hair for more volume. So even though I'm not black, I think I can say that you shouldn't assume black women are ashamed or something. And although you may think straightening hair to follow fashion trends is shallow, or not attractive, there are plenty of guys out there who think it is attractive.|`|Tzf6YxOjaa	the same reason white women curl their hair, the same reason women all colored women color their hair, put on make up or diet..|`|7tIzAz6Xaa	I am black and wish i had straight hair I am kind of tired of my boring hair I mean i should be lucky but like straight because curly is hard to deal with.|`|c8XlLN6Naa	To attract men probably. the same way a white woman with very curly hair might wana straighten even though natural hair is much nicer.|`|AA10888211	It's just the trend...every nationality goes through it somehow with hair, skin, nails, boobs, asians putting crease in their eye lids.    Who knows...the afro may even come back!!!  :O)|`|nE5nyzDcaa	I am almost 16 and ive been straightening my hair since i was like 8.  My mom actually made the decision for me at the time, because having my INSANE curls was waay to much work! (Like 2 hours to brush and braid!)   I don't grow my curls back now because i like my hair Straight, i think having straight hair gives me the freedom to do different styles. I also think having straight hair looks better (On me personally) and i don't care what other people think about it.  Its just the persons choice, and i don't think other people are telling us black girls to get it straightened to look better!  We do it for ourselves!  And i really don't think its White hair  But that's only my opinion =)|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	you keep your fade tight and don't worry about us....|`|jgVfC1tqaa	They're not doing it to make themselves white, or that white hair is that standerd, if someone thinks they look prettier a certain way, than they do it.
oE5kcNVZaa	I love gauges.  I think it shows individuality.  Mine are a really big part of me and my friends hated them at first too.  But then they got over it.  With any kind of body mod it's about making the outside of your body reflect the inside of your body.  The person inside my body is a gauged ear kind of girl.  You gotta decide if yours is.|`|W840msNTaa	i think they'ree fine if they don't go bigger than 10.  But if they get bigger than that, then its gross on anyone.    I think that most people don't like them, but if you like them than who cares? Just don't make them so big that they can never close up again.    edit: its not necessarily a turn-off or turn-on for me though, i don't really care about them much.|`|vXR5L8Jfaa	Personally, I think they're gross and look hideous. But hey, that's just my opinion, I don't care what people do with their lives. Not my business.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	im a guy and i find them very unattractive.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	I don't yucky!    But it doesnt make the person... I met the guys from Hinder and the one with those eww in his ears had the heart of a angel and the most gorgeous smile.  I thought the plugs took away from his good looks.    All the Best!!    Cinn =)|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	When I see a gauge, I think that maybe this person shouldn't reproduce.|`|dXDroPtfaa	I am a girl. And I find plugs-smaller ones attractive.  \  Gauges are okay too. Just when they keep it at minimum.  Stuff like the kind that's the size of your thumbs...THAT is gross.|`|RSfFN1Koaa	imagine a 60 year old with them    *shivers*|`|aDElEo4Xaa	yes|`|GBEgFS19aa	im not a big fan.  i think it looks unattractive, it sorta disgusts me  sorry,  but if you like them, its your body do w.e u want :P|`|AA11618466	I have my ears guaged.  There at a 6.  I'm not going any bigger. I'll most likely take them out soon.     But i think they're hot on guys.   I'm really into the, longish hair, lip piercings, guages, skinny jeans, kinda guys. The whole punkish/skaterish looking boys. I think they're gorgeous(:    So, to me. I think they're very attractive. Not when they're too big though.  But to others, they think they're weird. So, i think it goes both ways.|`|4WjZTF1saa	i think gauged earrings look really good as long as they arent crazy big|`|gR2xBi7zaa	i think that they're flippin awesome as long as they don't go over zero.

4lqwMnhJaa	No, they just peel the skin off the sheep and the sheep is fine.  Okay done with the sarcasm, but yes, they do kill the sheep.
nVQGpvuoaa	Yeah. It can affect a friendship a lot.  I'm in the same place as you.  I know my parents have money, its pretty obviously.  Like even when I'm not trying to show off, and someone says omg that so expensive and I'll go no not really and after I feel bad.  But friends get jealous when you have something and they don't like I'm jealous if my best friend gets a new boyfriend, even if I have one.   And she competes with me martial wise too...but like I don't even try anymore because it's not worth it, cuz just remember this, you should let them "win" or make your self not look at good and stuff because listen that stuff could be gone...and you won't be as "rich" anymore and looks will fade with time...but friendships last forever.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	sometimes it really does    a lot my college friends always give him crap because my parents have money and they buy me stuff that they can't afford. However i never once flaunted around them, yet they still give me crap sometimes for it|`|HiuZs5G5aa	yes it can affect friendships. just like anything else can. just don't brag about it and don't flash it. and don't show off expenisve things either.  what do you mean compete with you?|`|dXDroPtfaa	Yes, and no.  It really depends on your friends. Some friends may use you as a tool. Other may just try to compete with you(As you said) just to prove that even if you have money/nice cars/etc. they can still do better.     But yes, you don't see higher class people in society associating much with the less wealthy.|`|vXR5L8Jfaa	If it's a real friendship, it shouldn't affect anything.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	If you start paying for everything, and your friends start using you as a girl beacon then yes, not only will it affect friendship but its not friendship.  You have to beware of "floaters" or "freeloaders".  Learning to manage time, money & friends is an art and its important you learn it soon.  When you enter college you will have people who want to float off you and others (wealthier) that will want you to keep up with them.    Its not horrible to help a real friend who is poorer then you - my roommate in college couldn't afford to pay 1/4 the telephone bill or her graduation dress however 12 years later we are still friends and were both in each others weddings.     Just make sure you keep a balanced budget and don't give out "friendship loans" especially to the same person more than once if they don't pay you back.  Its a little thing at the moment however without taking proper precaution or planning you can end up in a ton of trouble and worse with no real friends at all.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Not for me it doesn't.. you do sound conceited though whether you're trying to or not, sorry.|`|RNi6gytSaa	yep....    if you bribe them/ give them *gifts* it will definantly attract anyone.. in a not so good way, they will only want you for your gifts.|`|7260c9120059c7fb296cfba63b174bb1aa	it can, cuz i kno one of my friends will sumtimes judge me n say im girly n spoiled just cuz my parents r wealthier than hers...its like shes tryin 2 make me feel inferior 2 her bcuz she feels inferior 2 me, which she shouldnt =)|`|IwaaSQZcaa	As shameful and wrong as it is...yeah.   Everything in the world is at some degree based on superficial things like this. And it's something that can't be controlled or prevented. It's intuition!|`|XFC9mHo9aa	Yes. We may not like it but it's a fact of life. Money and looks among a lot of other things superficial affect friendships, I'm not saying all. There are people who cling to others for the money and the looks because whatever it is, they can see benefits for these to their advantage. I can only guess what these things are.  To be straightforward, find friends who are at the same "status" as you are to avoid these competitions. But even then, finding real friends is not that easy. Real friends are gifts and if you have one or a lot you're lucky.|`|MCN7gdI8aa	yes it does, i learned it the hard way, u know, in the end... it really is best for everyone if you look for friends with you know... the same sort of idk social status? honestly, most people cannot handle having as a best friend someone who is in a different economic position, richer or poorer... either they feel superior or inferior...
hJmVcWekaa	I think they were really popular in the 70's and 80's i don't think they were as popular.  I don't know exactly what shoes they wore but when i had to dress up for 80's no one recommended converse at all.  hope that helps.|`|4mwVxvLOaa	just like today|`|CZfUO2kcaa	No, not really. By that time Reebok's were really in (high tops).|`|c26Ae2y1aa	Actually, they became really popular in the 70s, so I'm sure they were in the 80s
1dVoVp1gaa	u can use this American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel (u can buy that at Target i seen it there before) or American Crew Forming Cream (also buy at Target) M PRO Styling Gel for Men (from target) but to be honest u can just use pretty much any type of hair gel for ur hair to get that hair style. Oh and in my other answer -the 1 u choose me for best answer- i meant to say is u can use hair gel for that hairstyle and mouse gets it curly only.      ~SORRY 4 MAKING IT SO LONG
SwOQjBZNaa	They stopped making it, but it was the "291 Peace Off-shoulder Sweatshirt".

gPEtpwNvaa	I have curly hair.. its really curly, lol.    I love Sunsilk's Captivating Curl's 24/7 creme. Its makes my hair soft & I think it even hydrates it some. If you want to play up your waves ,try the Waves of Envy line. I'm sure it'll work just as well as the Captivating Curls.    For mousse, I like Herbal Essences Totally Twisted. Other good ones would be Tresemme Curl Care & Suave Professional Healthy Curls.    To style my hair, I always style my hair when wet.  Otherwise, it'll be a frizzy, gross mess.  I usually just put the creme in if I'm throwing it up in a bun. But then sometimes I'm like, "Ah ponytail!" and I just leave it in a pony. I use the mousse whenever I'm gonna be out & about all day. Either one will work & last, I assure you. (: For me it does..  Oh, & maybe a shampoo + conditioner will help, I know it helped me. I use Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine. Love the stuff. (:    Anyway, I hope this helps & isn't all confusing. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, 'cause I've been struggling with my curly hair & I've finally gotten it.

My friend wwithnatural ringlets loves Sally Hershenberger products...     I have wavy hair and this is a technique for a quick look in the morning:    1. Brush your hair with a long tooth comb  2. Take water and dampen your hair (do not make it dripping wet)  3. Apply the Sunsilk Catch the Wave and scrunch    I know it sounds like it would look horrible, but believe me it looks really fresh and beachy.

0SoglbRUaa	when you go to bed at night gel them to one side. then they will get used to them being there. and constantly put them over there.  make sure you wash out the gell hhaha.  and you can put a little hairspray but not a lot. ok?|`|GbfA7Rr8aa	put a bobby pin or a headband they always work great!|`|pOx6vwMwaa	you need to "train" them. clip then to the side with a bobby pin or a barette until they stay to the side without any help|`|hyVafhR4aa	you have to train them , when your blowdrying it , pin them off to the side and they will get used to it , also pin them over to the side at nighttime|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	I agree with the first answer, but if that is inconvenient, try a clip. it all just takes patience (and about a week)|`|FY8sITZEaa	hmmmmm|`|dDsoZ98Oaa	blow dry them and then straighten, then pin them with a bobby pin until they stay by themselves.|`|EytUZvyiaa	You probably have the same problem that I had.

4wm5kAygaa	If you want to model than try looking up local agencies in your area. Also know that modeling isn't just about being skinny (though that seems to be a requirement) it's about having some sort of special element about you that makes people think wow when they look at you.  Because of your height I doubt you would be able to do any sort of runway modeling, however you can look into print ads (these don't necessarily require you to be tall). Good luck and don't be discouraged if everything doesn't work out.|`|rd6eRnzTaa	5.2'? no.

Being a model involves a lot of sacrifice. It has a lot to do with fashion and being photogenic...and even more to do with looking THIN.  Do some research. Make your dream known, and keep your eyes open for all sorts of opportunities. I promise you that if you do that, you will find a way.|`|gxnXbftHaa	haha i am short too i am like 4" 9 but not skinny. i think you could model for something but not like runways or anything.. to short (don't worry i am short too)|`|pHEIxQoBaa	post pics|`|OkCrlU7Aaa	You can, but probably not like high fashion modeling.

I have a friend that I went to high school with that is into modeling and pageants. She really isn't much taller than you are. I'd say its more about your appearance and how you carry yourself.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	In print modeling it doesnt matter how tall you are (if your a "child") so ya you can (print means like magazines and such) commercials are thought of as acting not modeling, modeling involves no talking.|`|FY8sITZEaa	:OOO|`|YI9Js4qraa	Most models aren't that short, you most likely couldn't make it as a runway model.

For the first time do 15 minutes it is better and dont forget to wear tanoil or cream to protect your body and hide your face with a towel .Do it for 13-15 time and you will get the tan and then the spring is coming soon continue doing your tan under the sun.|`|1eRtd8F4aa	it depends on your skin type. if you have pale skin you shouldn't go in for the full time. it also depends on what type of bed it is and how new the bulbs are. when you go tanning at the salon, you can ask the person working there what they think you should do. i used to work at a tanning salon and they will always help you.|`|Xco5gdrBaa	yeah thats well too long!<br>  where abouts do you live tho cos i know these girls in sweden and they had like really low voltage so 20 minutes was nothin lol . <br>  as its your first time id go on for like 4 or 6 minutes.<br>  but yeah ask ye man in the salon<br>  :)

Natural highlights range in color from blonde to gold, copper, reddish, mahogany and more. Most women pay top dollar to have natural looking highlights placed in their hair.

Here is my instruction.  First:you go to meet a hairdresser and order him/her to cut all haird (you head look bald) , you can buy a cap if you don't want any one to see you bald head.  Second: go to a superamarket or some where similar, buy a wig that look like the hair style you want, wear it and HOORAY, you have the hair style you want.
24Xy8qWtaa	They all kind of cross through each other in one way or another, punk is a type of music, as is emo.. I guess, and along with scene they're all different styles that look quite similar.  Don't stress over it too much, I find that insecure people are the ones that freak out when you mess up their stereotype or whatever it is they want to call it.|`|UaJHq2vsaa	you shouldnt label but ill help you out hah.    emo - type on music, style, and short for EMOTIONAL. hah  scence - uh. more like clothing, hair hairs, crazy hair colors. tight clothes.  punk - is almost skater. tight pants/baggy pants with chains. usually punks wear tight clothes and listen to punk music. most punks are called punk because of the genre of music they listen to (PUNK)    i listen to punk music, and i wear skinng pants and tight clothes. and i have black hair 9 used to be purple blue and red.    im labeled punk and emo. i dont cut or listen to emo music.  people just label  but usually punk is the music u listen to, and how you act (almost trouble marker rebel) hahah    if you have anymore questions just ask.|`|Kjib1r07aa	mmkayy=)  a label is more than just clothing, you have to act it to, or you're a poser    scene-you wear very bright clothes and have your hair cut all funky    punk-you wear like you wear your hair like down and maybe a bow on the side of your hair and you mostly wear like darker clothes, but my friend is punk and she wears like a black shirt with bright stars on it    emo-you wear extremely tight pants and dark skinny clothes and look sad all the time, and you wear very dark makeup (girl or boy) and yes most emo's do cut themselves, but not all    goth-dark baggy clothes, most of the time worship the devil, like metal rock, have there hair covering their face    preppy- very perky and usually wearing pink or a bright color, has a lot of friends, listens to very girly music    casual-usually wears sweatpants or just jeans and a t-shirt, dresses up ocasionally, has friends but not like really popuular, listens to the newest hits      I'm pretty casual(:
wXloRCegaa	It's ok, girl.  There is a solution for you so don't stress.  Please don't look to makeup to fix skin care probs.  It never works because the problem always shines through.  So, I hate Clean and Clear because it just leaves me dry and tight.  I hate that!  I found this awesome natural company called Boscia and they make Intensifying Moisture Pack +   It's a multi-action moisture infusion, containing a nutrient-rich marine complex and comforting aloe leaf, instantly energizes dry, stressed complexions. Organic jojoba leaf, a powerful antioxidant, and willowherb, a unique anti-irritant, help soothe sensitivities and protect your skin from environmental damage.      What does this all mean?  It's freak'n awesome for clearing up the dry ickiness so you makeup will go one smooth and give you the even skin tone you want no flakey cakey.  Ech!    So, here's a link so you can see what I'm talking about...  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...|`|bHMPolh1aa	well, I don't know about makeup, but try putting sun-block on your face underneath your foundation, or at least some face-lotion. that should help the dryness.|`|KG4ZXJFsaa	I have the same problem, and what i find the most affective, is a  homemade face mask, its very simple but it works wonders, First smash half a banana, then add 1 tablespoon of honey, another thing you can do is add one tablespoon of any kind of lotion, mix it all together, then apply to face, rub in for about 5 min, then wash off, im serious this thing works!! Lol i have like a several more mask if yu want to email me :)|`|brmStGOuaa	well i have that same problem. What i do is before i put on my face make up i put olay face lotion on and it dries and doesn't make your skin oily and then you put on the foundation. But before you put on your foundation you should wait till it dries. Hope this helps (:|`|Yue2YKTnaa	St ives apricot scrub   its for dry skin|`|uOtZUzNOaa	to fix dry skin you need a facial lotion.  the wave makes your skin super soft..but it will dry your skin out if you don't use a moisturizer after it.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Clinique make 2 great moisturizers. One in a lotion form and one I a gel. I use the gel(still looks like lotion). Get  a moisturiser.|`|enIZWv4caa	Ehmagawd! I have that same problem! I have the wave to and it does nothing. I really wish I could help, but idk what will help. I know how horrible it is having to put makeup on and go to school with wierd flakes all over your face... =/  Good luck! I hope someone has some good advice! :D|`|mOVWQyyyaa	Just keep on using lotion in the Morning and especially before bed. But I wouldn't put on make-up because that makes it even dryer, which could be the problem in the first place.    Wash your face with face soap at least once a day and put lotion on at night. And don't put make-up on the dry areas!    It should help.|`|bWluw6zlaa	i had the same problem. i use lubridem daily moisture lotion on my face right when i get out of the shower, then when i go to do my makeup i apply it once more, and i use bare minerals. its expensive, but it really works good! it really doesn't dry out my skin like my old covergirl makeup did. :)|`|Rc5wpzSiaa	i have eczema on my face which is dry skin. i use hydrocortisone everyday on my face. than i use my liquid foundation...i dont use powder cause it feels to thick n my skin cant breath. you should try to buy hydrocortisone it really works for dry skin!!!!!!!!|`|IO5NDDzJaa	You should first buy a skincare line that is for dry skin, try Aveeno's Ultra-Calming Foaming Cleanser and moisturizer. It should help with the dryness of your skin and the flakes. Remember to wash your face everyday, morning and night to keep it clean and healthy looking.    For a foundation I think you should just stick with a tinted moisturizer because it will add a hint of colour and it will keep your skin smooth throughout the day. You can add powder too if you want. Hoped that helped! :)|`|f764f8579dffdd38648f2f3a677b7356aa	first and foremost, when using make up, it is important to apply a moisturizer as a make up base. even if your foundation says it has moisturizer, it ain't enough. remember to let the moisturizer dry first before applying anything on top of it.     second. Always! remove the make up when going to sleep. your pores need to take a breather, too! Use a milk cleanser and wash it twice  with your facial wash to completely remove the make up. this is important because your skin needs to be clean when applying your night toners and creams or it will just go to waste because your pores are blocked by impurities.     Third. I know it's hard to find the right face creams. choose the ones that are suitable for you. take samples from the counter girls. they would give you advice on which to use and they are there to help you make up your mind. best of all, it's free. however, when trying on the samples, be sure you don't overlap products because you won't know which makes your skin look the best. you should do this in a long period when you aren't going out much because if you have very sensitive skin, it may turn red or get breakouts if you choose the wrong products.    fourth. you need to exfoliate at least twice to 6 times a month but not more that. its like you dusting your room's nooks and crannies (hehheh) every two weeks, but doing it every day is just unnecessary.    Lastly, get a facial once a month. that is your general cleaning like wiping all your furniture down with pledge after alining it to feng shui... (I ran out of analogies... :D) Plus, these aesthetitians are trained to help you with your minor skin problems. its cheap but worth your money if you find the one suited for you. but if you want medical advice (you don't really have to), go to a dermatologist, its more expensive but worth it if you have major problems your aesthetitian can't help you with.
O9VW6RjEaa	i have all that, kinda sorta long forehead and short hair,but 2-3 inches below my shoulders.   i read in a magazine how to fake side swept bangs, and it worked better for me than actually getting bangs. XDD  but just comb it down, make it look like bangs, and clip.  it'll cover up your forehead. ;)  try buns, ponytails, and half up half down. =)
mji7KtSEaa	A hair weave is synthetic/human hair the is combines with your real hair. There are many ways to do this, but most common is to glue,sow,or braid it in. It's basically a time of hair extension.|`|y8jIXgOdaa	something that you "sew" into your hair if you dont have a lot of hair. (or if you cant grow long hair)|`|88aab67b8f8f9204a8c653c60f437085aa	hair extensions|`|b5NlpGzAaa	if you have little hair, lieke barely any, they get this wig and attach it to the little hair you have.making it seem longer. :)|`|n9REPjaxaa	A method of getting hair extensions|`|DNZFw76taa	ummmm getting a hair weave has NOTHING to do with having little or no hair. Girls with healthy long hair get them too. Look at let;s say...beyonce. Her hair is naturally long if u ever saw it, but sh still likes the full look, and likes different styles. It is better to have weave rather than constantly depress and destroy and burn out your ownhair. My hair is long and beautiful, but i prefer hair weaves because i can do whatever i want with them, make myslef look like my hair is really short, really long, really full curly, thin, however i am feeling that day. i love it and think it is neat. It can be damaging to your hair depending on how you wear it. There are so many different weaves like the ones Tyra Banks wears are actually lace front wigs. I wear those to parties and clubs and what not. it looks super ultra real and natural and does not feel uncomfortable. It's not just for black girls, brittney spears went from bald headed to unbeweavable in a matter of seconds. it's for everyone who isn't afraid of a little change. Just doens't have to be permanent. For examle, Last week, my hair was a honey almod brown, and this week, it's jet black., i am a model. all without damaging my hair. Being bald has nothing to do with it. Be proud of your own hair is what's important. Don't think that you are only pretty if u have long hair. Girls with short hair and bald hair are cute too.
mGoun4g3aa	thats probably not a good idea, theyre made for men. if you really like the smell just buy a bottle and u can smell it whenever u want, just dont wear it :]|`|EJL5QoDraa	sometimes I use my boyfriends bodywash that is ax, I like the way it smells, I dont see anything wrong with it|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	eww. Axe has the most annoying, over powering smell. You should stick with the girl stuff if you smell|`|z8VRBWPDaa	omg! no don't do that.....wear something else, and get a guy that wears axe/tag.|`|xtEiQ9TBaa	yea im so sure i just even ask a boy right now!!|`|c5945tSvaa	gurl let me tell u a little story!!!     omg! me and my friends put on guy colonge and we wear axe deodarent all the time not even kiddin!   i wear it when i go out on dates!   some guyz do think its a little wierd but than they dont care cuz its not like we smell bad!   my bf actuallu thought it was cute. !!  lol      wear it if u like it dont listen to other ppl! :P|`|LCT1RrXvaa	nope i wear it all the time i have like three different guy scented sprays...... as long as you don't wear too much.. :]|`|96YWEYtlaa	I am a girl, and was actually attracted to another girl that I found out later wore Axe. :X She dressed like a guy too.    I LOVE the smell of Axe, so I make my boyfriend wear it as deodorant. :)|`|1mQlYWG7aa	Don't wear it! Trust me, hun. (;|`|51oZWvKPaa	i would not like that because it is meant for boys and wat if the boy was wearing the same thing.|`|w4MRIYGGaa	That's normal that you should like the smell.. that's why the opposite gender should wear it, so it attracts to you. Haha. :)     like on the Axe commercials, it talks about how Axe attracts women. So if you wore it, people might be like "What is she trying to do? Attract women?" That's just an honest opinion. I'm not trying to be mean..       but I would not though. Because Axe has a really masculine smell to it. I admit, I like the smell too, but it's a bit too.. strong, ya know? For a girl..     Hope I helped! Good luck. :D
YeQHg7Tvaa	no sweetie, that's called tacky.|`|s1Sj3u5faa	hmmmm could be cool ha.  what if the bangs were like white and hair was like a bright color..or opposite?    idk, cool idea though|`|ByxEE8eeaa	I used to have black hair with bleach-blonde bangs. It was pretty sweet. Let me see if I can rustle up a picture to send you. I think black and pink would be awesome. Almost like a flamingo...|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	If you want bright colors, I would choose green bangs and blue hair, but thats just me. But if you want natural hair colors I would do blonde bangs and light brown  hair, but yes that would look pretty damn awesome! :)|`|UoZghlvCaa	bleach blonde bangs and black hair.|`|aOQZ2ZAOaa	i do! i have brown hair and pink bangs.   i say do it!|`|AA10566303	platinum and ebony|`|M9DWMQijaa	my friend has the tip of her bangs purple and her tips too  it looks pretty but idk about two different colors
63s3G8YUaa	My definition is : a person with a style both individual and modern, who always looks chic no matter what, and has a signature style or piece. Audrey Hepburn and Twiggy are great examples, because Audrey made the now "iconic" black dress extremely classic and chic, and Twiggy brought mod into the mainstream, and still has pieces inspired by her today. A true icon will leave their mark on fashion and be an inspiration to others.
FuqdMHfMaa	look up online pictures of people with your face shape with a bob.  then explain that it would be very flattering and would give you the look you want.  explain how you could style your hair many different ways to give more variety to your life, and she will understand.  my mom is always upset when i cut my hair, because she is so jealous, but she understands that i have my own opinions of how i should look and she lets me do it.|`|ALidyPnXaa	Tell your mom it's your hair and you're  doing what you want with it.  Then show her the way you want it  cut & that's that =D|`|88aab67b8f8f9204a8c653c60f437085aa	I know how you feel. My mom hates it when I tell her that I'm going to get my hair trimmed let alone cut. She always tells me "don't let them cut too much" lol. Show your mom a picture of the type of bob you want and hope she likes it.|`|hZlwaaP2aa	well, just talk to your mom. Tell her its your hair and your choice and you're the one that has to walk around with it, not her! tell her that you are sick of your long hair and want to try something new. Do what makes you happy|`|FY8sITZEaa	yo mom its my hair and i want it short!!!!!  deal with your own long hair issues  jk ;P haha just say  oo mother dearest[ in the sweetest voice] i want....................................... HAIR
weXxqGjOaa	go for it!    But of course your going to have to bleach it first to get the purple to be noticable, and try to keep the color in so it doesn't fade!!    hope I helped!|`|LGnQNUIWaa	i quite like it, very different but still nice.|`|81N5nM7Aaa	i like it|`|ZMzZ8H0Waa	looks ok|`|e158WyFGaa	Go for darker purple   but you are very pretty  i like it.  :D|`|HF3iyIGVaa	You are a stupid fat wanna be slut aren't you, and since you want emo hair its pretty obvious you are one ugly person.|`|55G0BNCzaa	i think it'll look good!|`|OsiD4HIzaa	don't label yourself emo if u r truley not deep down. Label yourself scene.|`|7tIzAz6Xaa	That would be cool with layers!|`|bHMPolh1aa	it'd look awesome! I have dark brown hair, too, and I'm gonna dye my bangs bright blue. But you really shouldn't care if it looks good or not. just as long as you like it is all that matters. Peace out, chick!|`|y8jIXgOdaa	eugh, emo... not so flattering|`|WQUeP4FZaa	yea it looks koooool|`|yenUJGsoaa	the black,with purple looks sweet,but maybe after a change u might think about going to a red or pink instead of purple|`|qjutViNuaa	i think that it would look good as long as it ends up a good color purple.|`|GZCmyzBYaa	i don't really like it....sorry!!!|`|CuhJRewLaa	itll look pretty hot, as long as your skin isnt like really pale|`|OYcB4rvraa	I think it will look really nice.!|`|SCTMtrjhaa	That cute! Go for it...|`|h8QotXRXaa	yea, that would look really cute!!|`|qKIeshVWaa	yepp do it. her hair is cute as. but her purple looks a little washed out, so go for something that stands out more.  good luck!|`|bed8QNUaaa	do it!!|`|f6851264bc5d56ceb1264b29ddb15bddaa	yeahh it looks awesome =]  veryyyyyyy cool|`|58jwkbbSaa	Ohhh I love it!  But i would say go for a little darker purple, I don't really like the lavender.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	It's much more interesting than the hackneyed BLEACHED BLONDE look, that's for sure!|`|BAkfz657aa	you will probably have a lot of breakage|`|foTSL4vjaa	I like that. i've seen it before and it would look nice lol|`|y73Y4aEPaa	i didnt really like it much.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Yes! And I'm old enough to be your mom.|`|kJ7tmwE6aa	thats hideous..|`|Lsa2LPrMaa	i like this.  but the bottom layer where you dye it purple, cut it a little bit shorter than the girl in the video.  i think blonde would look cute too  perfect for spring coming up|`|1d42e6bc658c3475edaf4a3bc6b2dc80aa	Are you emo or punk? You can't be both - they're like polar opposites. But yeah, purple and black looks good together.|`|ZYlS5Nk6aa	i wouldennt say it looks "nice"  but its nice for  emo/punk what i do not like is when people have bangs so long you cant see there eyes so dot do that but have clean bangs so u know u can...see|`|lbMUNNCuaa	I had my hair purple for a while years ago, loved it! I think you'll look beautiful no matter what you do to your hair.   Just be careful of damage. Keep it well conditioned after wards. And make sure the purple isn't going to be runny if you get caught in the rain... been there not so fun!|`|St6Jvc3Daa	that would look cute.  (:|`|l96BXkMwaa	That's hot. Go for it!

Hopefully you can snag one of these guys...I wouldn't mind if you tell me what happens ha ha BUT if it were me I would wear dark eyeliner with bronze or some type of shimmery eyeshadow. Play your makeup natural. Never forget the lip gloss! Guys love lip gloss. For my hair I would straighten or curl the ends. For clothing, if it is warm I would wear a red tank or strapless shirt for the cardinals or the same thing but in yellow for the steelers with dark skinny jeans or mini skirt with flip flops, converse, or flats. Keep jewelery to a minimum like pearl ea rings or diamond studs would do fine or even just a yellow or blue necklace would do great.Don't forget to be fun, flirty, and ALWAYS be yourself around guys.|`|FQuuztpQaa	Go shop some dresses & do your hair, go buy some jewelry,    Forever 21, wherever you do your hair, & claires,    A decent 14yr girl would have get some buns, buy ground beef, cheese slices, & cook it up.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.      Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product.

jez0O0bXaa	If you can't get the good professional products, Sally's is the next best place ask them for assistance. DO NOT USE A STRIPPER YOU WILL REDOX YOUR HAIR.   You probably have warm undertones.  Kalidacolors purple or blue mixed with 40 volume (if they will sell it to you if not 20%). Also use a shampoo for blondes. Use a good reconstuctor like Joico it will repair any damage.|`|wgdHd2Eraa	I use a champagne to platinum (or something like that) glaze. It doesn't change your color, but it took out the yellow and now my hair is back to light blonde. But i didn't bleach mine, so it might not do the same. John Freida btw|`|yRdcEkZJaa	I wouldn't put anything else in my hair and i would make a hair appointment first think in the morning. When you are trying to go blonde you should really have a professional do it. I know it cost $$ but there is a reason, they know what their doing.|`|wu2NyhCVaa	Well if you wanted a platinum A.K.A. white blonde, then you need a toner like clairol professional born blonde toner 351 silent snow, it is purple and purple takes out yellow orangey colours, or any other type of toner, just check that the coulour is purple, or purpley blue before you buy it. Good luck :)

Good luck!|`|HxZyPXS0aa	umm.    you can try           *max factor  it will smudge just a little on the corner of the eye, but it lasts a really long time.    but if you could go somewhere were they sell              * MAC, their eyeliners are really good and last alll day.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Technically it's not because it can really dry your hair and make it break.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	To be honest, blowdrying your hair is not good for it.  Overdrying the hair causes strands to dry out and break.   Your best bet is to blowdry your hair 80 percent dry, and let the rest dry naturally OR do the exact opposite:   Let hair naturally dry half-way, then finish with the blowdry.   When you can, I recommend skipping the blowdryer altogether!  It is a quick way to dry you're hair,  but can leave in crinkly, dry, and damaged, with split ends!        good luck.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	I don't really think it's "good", necessarily.  It can damage your hair.  But it does usually make for a nice hair-do.|`|sO5KeGu8aa	No...it's bad for your hair.

The only upside to it would be to get out of the house faster. If you have to use it, use a heat protector.|`|sIEwJ1pjaa	Well, heat expands things.  Thats why your supposed to wash your face while showering in hot water, because your pores expand in the heat.    When you blow dry your hair, your hair pores open. Which I guess would induce faster hair growth.|`|2lb2Nmsgaa	no, it damages your hair

It might give a different look. OR part your hair differently...like more   hair on one side.   Maybe you could add volume to your hair by giving it a waves.|`|o510SIhGaa	If you have some time to do your hair, try adding some fishtails or french braids to the styles you already wear. I love to wear my hair in a half pony, but pulled back by french braids, I start with the hair right behind my ears, leaving a little in front, and work back and slightly up until I reach the back of my head. Use a bobby pin to hold it in place while you do the other side. This looks fantastic by the way if you part your hair on the side instead of the middle.     If you have hair that's not really good for braiding, here's another idea. Comb your hair from the forehead straight back to get rid of the part. Section your hair into 3 even sections, from one ear to the other (act like you're pulling your bangs straight back, thats one section, and the other two will be the hair from there to your ears). Tie these off with little rubber bands (or tiny claw clips), So you now have 3 mini ponies. Now take the mini pony on one side and half the middle pony, and tie those together. Take the pony on the other side and the remaining half from the middle and those together. So now you have 2 mini ponies. Now take those 2 mini ponies and tie them together so you have one.    I know this sounds really complicated in writing but it is so easy if I could just show you. Instead of a simple half pony, it's a 3-2-1 half pony. You can make the style as lose or as tight as you like, but it will look so pretty, especially with long hair!    Hope this helps!
DzLX1ophaa	The long bob, which is what you described is THE haircut right now... as long as you straighten your hair to make a good first impression you have nothing to worry about, it looks good on every face shape ;)     Just act confident, don't ask how you look, even if you are nervous, if people sense that you are comfortable with your new haircut they will automatically love it.|`|722561d7c12f06d39d643393351ba989aa	If u like ur hair then dont worry.

You helped someone out, and that's all that matters. Don't pay attention to what they think, because what I've learned, and you've probably heard it before too, is when you accept yourself, others will too. =)  So rock that haircut, just because it's different, doesn't mean it's not pretty.|`|hZlwaaP2aa	you did a great thing by donating your hair!  people may react to it because it's a big change, but I guarntee they'll say things like "it looks really good!" :D  be confident, you'll get used to it and i'm sure you'll even start to love it yourself!

67be362fa9bfa1a21547a78f99144ed6aa	Have you considered waxing?  Hair does grow back, but is finer and less noticeable because the root is being removed in addition to the shaft.  Shaving gives me problems similar to the ones you describe, so I wax.  You just have to be sure to use a special product, such as PFB or something containing salicylic acid, to prevent ingrowns.    If waxing is not an option, be sure to use a fresh razor each time and shave in the shower - the heat and moisture will soften the hair, making it easier to shave.  Exfoliate your legs regularly and use PFB or salicylic acid to prevent ingrowns.    Hair on the backside is fairly common and since you're young and no one should be looking at your butt, you don't need to worry about it.  If it's that huge a deal to you, though, you might want to give a buffing mitt a try.|`|mQhYZk2eaa	get rid of the bumps....your legs r probably irritated

For Locks of Love, you have to give at least 10 inches and you should get 1 inch trimmed before that to get rid of all split ends so your hair would still be about collarbone length.

You have really pretty hair though.|`|3Fwet0PVaa	how long did it take u to grow your hair??? just cut it a lil bit btw|`|P6KPjt1naa	wow your hair is so pretty! my advice is to cut it a little longer than shoulder length. that way you can still look pretty and you can help someone out.|`|9c47R7Qaaa	ohhh. dang gurl!!!   your hair is beautiful  but i thought my hair was hard to wash!!! doesnt it get all tangled in the shower???   hmm. i would give it to locks of love!!! someone would be very lucky to get such pretty hair!   and your hair would look very cute short.   you can still curl it and stuff and make it look pretty.  just donate like 11 or 12 inches.|`|ItJhWTCBaa	Yeah, you should donate!

So seriously think about your decision first.   I think your really pretty, so you can definitely work the short hair.|`|uxuAgrtJaa	I think your long hair is gorgeous and I'd love to have it.  but giving it to locks of love would be very generous and   caring of you, and besides your a cute girl so short hair  will look good on you too.|`|UpkNDRvnaa	yeaa cut your hair! you will be so much prettier if you cut your hair shorter, not to short but shorter.like some where in between your boobs and shoulders.|`|hZlwaaP2aa	wow, your hair IS too long!

EzjLtMoPaa	It depends a lot on how much you want to or can afford to spend and where you live (i.e. which stores are available in you area).    Did you want to shop online and then pick it up at a chain store location?!  Why don't you try the usual department stores like JCP, Dillards, etc.  I have been to a few military balls myself, and the cheapest I ever got away with was simple chiffon-ish black summer dress from H&M for under $40 which I vamped up with dressy accessories like jewelry, a little sparkly beaded clutch, strappy heels, appropriate make up and nicely coiffed hair...|`|XBvSpAYyaa	Go here.

JOSIYzQHaa	Industrial piercing, they're hella cool but like most bod mods they DO hurt.  It depends on your threshold of pain, really.  Contrary to some of the answers I already saw on here, you can NOT get it done at a mall, and if by some sick reason or joke you can, I would NOT suggest it.  Go to a local piercer as they are trained and sterile.  Check around for prices, all of the local shops here in MD range from $45-60.    The worst part with an industrial is that you can hear the pop when the needle goes through - imagine having to hear it TWICE.    Industrials are the easiest to get infected.  You could do everything right and they can still easily get infected.  They require a HUGE amount of attention.  Also, sleeping can be a chore when you have one.    In the USA, 18 is the age of consent and you cannot get a piercing anywhere if you are not 18 UNLESS you have a parent or guardian with you.  If you find a place that would pierce a minor, then it's clearly too risky and not worth it.  Your ear can collapse from trauma and damage if your piercing is not done properly or gets infected.    All in all, Industrials are actually a fun experience to get when you have the right piercer!  If you're afraid of the pain, just think of how SWEET it will look when it's all over with! :)  Good luck!|`|rd6eRnzTaa	it's an industrial. 18, same as any other.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	dont do your genitals. you will have problems there, the rest of your life.|`|FcovHfZcaa	i think like u jus need an id and it like 24 bucks and it hurts like 4 a week but then its all good|`|5nQjGlkVaa	its called an industrial bar.... i wouldnt noe about anything else tho..|`|yenUJGsoaa	theres no name for just ear pierce,and theres no certain age for that maybe 10 up and like most 15 to 20 dollars|`|3Kv3vlebaa	it's called an industrial body piercing. I ranges between 50-60 depending on where you go. I'm pretty sure for any body piercing or tattoos you have to be 18 in order not to have parental permission. Pain wise it depends how you handle pain. But, it does hurt pretty badly because you're going through cartilage.|`|WT0EHpiFaa	I had one! its an industrial ear peircing, cost is around thirty bucks (without the bar included) and it hurts like hell.  mine got infected and had to be taken out btw, but it was fun|`|v7tnfgeHaa	I think it is called like, the Industrial, or something like that...?|`|3Fma3URSaa	like 20 bucks    dont do it!! it hurts like hell|`|f6851264bc5d56ceb1264b29ddb15bddaa	uhm industrial piercingG?  well i have that, it didnt hurt at all  U can get at the mall, or tatoo places  costs about 25 or 30 depends.  doesnt hurt at all, dont worry, just take a deep breath and there it is =]|`|RAM3KZY2aa	It's called an Industrial piercing. I think you have to be 18 with no parent signature. And if you are younger then that you have to have a parent or guardians signature. I don't know if it hurts. I don't have one. But a friend has one and she said it doesn't hurt. It really depends on your pain tolerance. Hope I Helped!                               ~Emily~|`|jd1E4Szbaa	OH your talking bout the hole from your ear lobe??|`|mqcVaxMvaa	eighteen is the age without parental consent.  price varies on who does it, and what the peircing is made of/ size.  of course it hurts, it'll hurt so bad you'll cry.|`|l9Kcq3F1aa	The industrial.  I think it would hurt but its all up to how you can put up with pain.    Im not sure on prices. Maybe ring up a local piercing place or hairdresser and ask them|`|Vdl7fiPhaa	It's an industrial,   I got mine for $50,  including jewelry.    I can't besure on the price though because, they might charge more for a unique piercing:    This is what I consider normal:  http://www.alivenotdead.com/attachments/...  And I have no idea how much this would cost:  http://tattoo.about.com/library/graphics...    So yeah, it just depends what you get.  As for your age, in Ohio, you have to be atleast 14   (with parent consent, until your over 18),  all states are different (you have to go to a tattoo  shop, in case you didn't know.)  And it really depends how sensitive your skin is,  for me it was a bit of pressure, and it kinda made me  flinch, hahahha. And it sucks having to get it twice  on one ear.      Good Luck! Hope it works out!

p5IR7ezTaa	I say you should buy a size  3  unless your hips are bigger and your legs but im pretty sure you are skinny but if they arent then i size 3 should work

Good luck. :)|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	yes your should definitely get layers and side bangs!|`|BAkfz657aa	you dont need layers for a side bang. try an angle in the front an def do some vertical layers NOT horizontal|`|bMhLdnsbaa	well, why would u want 2? but ya|`|brHPYhWbaa	ya it wud look good|`|dDsoZ98Oaa	when you get layers your hair won't be dead straight anymore, trust me.  it will look nice though, i recommend you get them and the bangs too! best of luck :)|`|ychORlVPaa	use hairspray?     here's a video of how to have more volume:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcy5ZxPlg...|`|SBP8l2xLaa	yes most definitely ...I got fine hair and keep it straight layers is nice helps add volume and gives it a more fuller look ..also try adding is some   conditioners that leave your hair thicker ..you ca buy it in most salons|`|oTEYvL7oaa	Yes you can get layers with straight hair, thats how my hair is, when you get it layered you just have to train your hair with rollers so you can have curls....layers will also make your hair look fuller too........|`|DzLX1ophaa	You can, but the problem with really straight hair is that if the hairstylist messes up it will be very noticeable, so make sure you go to a good salon to have a quality haircut, ask the stylist to texturize the layers, good luck!|`|78e1QUkBaa	apply gel|`|dA2zqiZ0aa	u should probably get scene hair it's nice and pretty    http://i291.photobucket.com/albums/ll294...    http://i291.photobucket.com/albums/ll294...    http://i291.photobucket.com/albums/ll294...|`|BcAocj0Naa	ya layers look great even if you have thin hair|`|Dyn8oLVxaa	my girlfriend had the same kind of hair but then she got it bleached platinum and now it has so much volume and movement it looks great. you should  try it.she got short layers on top and long layers near the bottom and her hair looks really thick compared to what it used to look like,|`|HypqcnJaaa	Yes it *should* add volume. And I think bangs would look really nice (side bangs). :)|`|DGGNXoXraa	omg yes!!! straight hair wit layers is awesome!! and get side swept bangs.|`|XP36zr63aa	yeah layers are cute. ive gotten layers before and my hair is much like yours.  the only thing is getting layers with straight, fine hair makes your hair appear thinner and less voluminous. theres ways to help that tho by putting a little product in it or teasing it a little.
UByvC54Xaa	Yeah, you can have dyed dreadlocks.    Try not to bleach too much (if you are thinking of bleaching) as it can get trapped deep inside the dread and eventually damage the dreadlock.    Also, dreadlocks will really absorb the dye so you will go through lots more than undreaded hair. Try to stick with organic hairdyes as chemicals can damage your dreads and do not use the conditioner that comes with the dye.    If you are one of those people that like to change their hair colour as often as their underwear - perhaps consider getting some synthetic dread falls.|`|Nj58Vi62aa	obviously

Consider a tank dress or simple A line dress, then, perhaps with a shelf bra already in it.  Add a variety of belts for shaping, shawls or scarves or bandannas for color and cover.      Take a look at, e.g. http://sewing.patternreview.com/SewingPa... or  http://www.birchstreetclothing.com/prod.... or http://www.birchstreetclothing.com/prod....      Or consider a double layered dress like: http://www.birchstreetclothing.com/prod....      Or go retro... take a look at http://www.folkwear.com and look at the Monte Carlo Dress and Greek Island Dress (in the retro section).  The Town and Country dress is also much more comfortable than you might guess with the waist seam.    Or draw the dress you want  and then look for patterns with similar silhouette.

I got it done when I was 14 and now I am almost 20.    I will tell you it is not what you expect it to be.  But it really does not hurt like everyone makes it out to.  It is a pinch and it is over.    Still every ones pain tolerance is different.    Every ones healing time is different, most piercers recommend leaving it in for 9-12 months before you change the jewelry.

K5gZLSl7aa	You have some very good facial qualities, you eyes for instance. So go get your eyebrows waxed to help enhance and bring out your eyes more. Straighten your hair, and find a good facial cleanser to help the acne. You have beautiful lips so use a little lip gloss to give them that extra kissable look!

JmNs0Hgbaa	you're not really stereotypical, its quite hard to judge because you have so many qualities (which is good!).   but i'd say you're closest to 'good little church girl'.  you like helping people, you like singing/writing your own songs, you get good grades.. etc.  but some qualities that contradict that stereotype: your song taste, your fashion.    its kinda hard! you're no stereotype! you are what you are :)|`|s9zefBbvaa	You are a typical narcissist. Examples - you taught yourself and how wonderful you are (make own clothes, help others, good student) but your actions are to satisfy your need to be admired by others (that's why you asked the question).

AA11597935	nope , consedirng your height , i thnk u have long beautiful legs . so flaunt them , wax them and let them be bare , the pantyhose would hide ur best assests . as for the shoes i thng the LBD would go well with high heels- peep toes or pumps . u can also add a nice clutch if u like . happy clubbing!|`|5a5jZ1braa	that's an Ok look, but i prefer barelegs and closed toe heels...the starlets are going that route these days.|`|ulxe0jPZaa	Yes....good choice and the boots too.  I think you will look great!|`|ZttGhvMTaa	It depends where you live for one thing. Is the weather warm or very cold where oyu are right now? What kind of shape are your legs in too? You could wear black nylons with high heels as long as the shoes are closed toe. Knee high boots will draw attention to the thigh if you do not wear dark nylons so that is something to think about also. Why not wear black nylons with the boots and nice silver chain belt around the waist?
Tv27jWVDaa	Haha Im in the same boat you are I got mines pierced like 6-7 days ago and Now my Inner conch hurts like heck and Its really red and swollen in the back I guess the best thing to do is clean with H20 or Sea salts?

Get a foundation that goes with your skin tone, And if you wanted to get fancy go to a mac store and ask for help they will help you find things that will look good with your skin tone and all that. And if you don't want to go to a store like that and just apply it as followed. Put it on your middle finger or pointer finger, and apply it on your chin, forehead and all around your face. and Idk if you have really nice clear skin or not so much but if you do then you won't need to much foundation. next. Mascara.Just apply that its easy. blush when applying smile so you can see your cheek bone. <br>  Hope I helped Ps and when taking off makeup use a wash cloth and Vaseline. rub your eyes a couple times.<br>  And go to youtube. there are a bunch of videos that will help more!<br>  Xoxo<br>  <3 Mary <3|`|I0B7oAfOaa	If you do decide to wear make up- use it sparingly. At 13 your skin is probably too pretty to cover up! At most maybe a touch of mascara on top lashes. Maybe a hint of blush and gloss. If you get acne, try a concealer stick that matches your skin tone and has a bit of salicylic acid as a treatment. Make up looks best when it enhances natural beauty rather than hiding it!|`|xbbEbvxnaa	look at someone who you like how they put on makeup, then say, can I watch how you put on your make up because I think you do a good job.  OR else, look at magazine to see who you like and copy their style.  NOT too much make up cause you will look like a clown.|`|XqaTkKuaaa	heh go on youtube & look|`|ldElfsOCaa	The secret is to look like you are not wearing make-up and to enhance your features. Do not wear foundation unless you have very flawed skin...it is not necessary otherwise. Foundation can be dotted on small blemishes as needed. If you wear darker eye colors than you want light lips and vice versa. If you make both areas dark at the same time you will look like a clown. Blush is not necessary but if you use it, get a shade close to your skin range...not something too dark. Apply along cheekbone with sweeping strokes from the ear forward just under the cheekbone. Eyeliner does not need to encircle the entire eye and this give a raccoon effect. Lip liner is not necessary either unless you have a week lip line naturally. When choosing make-up, remember to look for mineral make-up...much healthier for the skin. Also remember that less is better|`|wVELDOb1aa	You want to wash your face very we'll first. Than you want to get the right foundation color that matches your skin tone. Put on your foundation first, than powder. Than put on a eye color, mascara, and blush. Than lipstick.

Start out experimenting, to see what looks the best.. like eyeshadows and liners.. eventually you'll figure it out. but your look will change over time. and i'd advise you not to use coverup or foundation unless you need it because it'll most likely make you break out.|`|NjcV19f3aa	is this Ceci first of all....just ask me....if it isn't then its really easy. everyone has a different way of putting on makeup.first you take either a cover up product or if you just want to put on eyeshadow...well you pic a color that would.......g2g sorry|`|eQ1phaDXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  beauty-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  with videos in how to apply makeup step by step<br>  it really worked for me|`|ufjzzm7Saa	If you go to YouTube and type in  ' How to do makeup ' there will be hundreds of videos that help you. <br>  That's how I got started. <br>  Good luck !|`|dlc9FGvRaa	are you 13 and put make up on? oh sweet lord... whats next?|`|jzSx5kAxaa	Sorry, i'm a guy and so obviously i have no idea but wanted to check in with your question to see how a girl does solve such a dilema..<br>  <br>  I am guessing its a thing you need to ask a family member (mom, sister, close family friend) since you can't read that kind of thing.  <br>  <br>  From my experience of watching the best looking girls its seems to be not applying too much...its gotta look natural and bring out your features without looking like someone slapped a coat of paint.<br>  <br>  But you are 13 and its not really important yet but learning how to is still a good idea|`|rWO4jwyEaa	Your still to young to wear makeup. And makeup can ruin your skin. Also don't wear makeup just because your friends are doing it. Be your own independent person don't feel pressured into wearing makeup just because all your friends wear makeup. If you chose not to wear makeup some people might even respect you for being your own person.|`|eMSP740Taa	At 13, I would suggest for you to just have fun with some different colored sparkly lip glosses. At your age, you really shouldn't wear anything else. You would probably look a little silly with a face full of makeup.

AA10354985	 METALLIC EXTRACTOR    A metallic instrument that has a small and round opening at the end, the extractor can be used to remove each blackhead individually.   This was shown on The Dr's show, it worked very well and it is the safest way to get rid of those nasty little blackheads. Clean off the skin first with alcohol wipe and again after you pop the blackhead.    You can type in the name above or call your drug store or   This is by far the most effective method but must be done properly to prevent scarring. The skin is not squeezed by any means and all the contents of the clogged pore are extracted as the tool exerts pressure around the pore to make the contents pop out.     Keep the tool parallel (not perpendicular) to the skin and press around the blackhead with the smaller circular head. Do not drag the tool across the skin as it can cause skin ripping and permanent damage    Good luck and I've given you a link below on the subjects|`|yqKi9l9laa	proactiv solution really does work. but you have to use it every day or you'll start breaking out again. that's the only downside.    also neutrogena oil free acne wash daily scrub works amazingly. once you're done using it your face actually feels clean and cool.     i promise these work! you won't regret it.    try neutrogena first though.    make sure you wash off your make up before going to bed too because the oils in it will clog your pores. i made the mistake of doing that and it didn't turn out pretty.    good luck!|`|qYVJHc7Yaa	My skin type is oil and have a lot of black heads.

Use a light shade (probably white) of blush, or shadow works even (but it'll run out quickly)<br>  use a small brush to place the powder under your eyes, on the tops of your cheeks (brush it up to your temple) on your nose, under your nose (above your lips), on your chin, and also on your forhead.<br>  <br>  This is where light hits your face.<br>  <br>  Take a darker shade (bronzer) and apply it to your jaw line.<br>  Blush (not much, you don't want anyone to be able to see it ) on your cheek bones.<br>  <br>  Use your fingers (clean fingers!!!) to rub the shades together, if it's too bright then use some fountation powder.<br>  <br>  <br>  Usually, noone notices this at all- and it makes a huge difference. I would sugest trying this when you don't have to go out first, incase you mess up. ^-^<br>  <br>  use liner on your waterline, lift up your top lashes, and use a black/brown pencil liner. Just go over the waterline.<br>  <br>  makes your lashes thicker, but noone can see the liner.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  this is something noone will see, but i'm amazed at how well it works.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for hair, the best thing to do is ask your stylist *the girl cutting your hair* what she thinks would look best on you.<br>  She'll have a better idea then anyone on the internet. <br>  <br>  But, layers often look very good with oval face shapes.<br>  Maybe some side-swept bangs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make sure to keep your brows in check, keeping them well taken care of makes a large differance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bananas help give boosts to your matabolism, and will help you loose weight through out the day. So, try and start eating them for breackfast and before you go to sleep.<br>  <br>  Makes sure to get lots of sleep, as this is when you burn a lot of weight.<br>  <br>  Do some crunches, situps, and push ups. <br>  These are things you can do easily at home, and they're really great workouts.<br>  <br>  start out with 100 crunches (they're not hard, 100 isn't goign to hurt much don't worry)<br>  be in a pushup position, and just lift your shoulders off the ground. Make sure the be looking up at the ceiling, and going up in that direction.<br>  don't pull up with your arms or neck, that will not help you, but hurt your spine a lot.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sit ups, start out with like 20 or so- then as you go on pick it up a lot. Try to get to 50 or 70 of these.<br>  Make sure to go all the way up, and touch your elbows to your knees.<br>  <br>  <br>  push ups- try 10 at a time, doing pushups between these is a good idea.  Try to get to 3 sets of 10.<br>  <br>  make sure to keep your hands on the ground, directly under your shoulders! <br>  Farther appart will hurt, and it's really hard if they're close together.<br>  Keep your head looking down at the floor.<br>  <br>  keep your back straight, and stay on your toes.<br>  <br>  I've got to leave now, I wuold help more if i could but i'm late!

leRNOgnWaa	I'm in school as well and I dress to cover mine. You don't have to wear swearers or long sleeve shirts to cover the tattoo (unless it goes below your shirt line). Most of the time you can cover the tattoo with a short sleeve shirt. If you don't like the tattoo then get it removed but, if you like it then keep it. It sounds like it cost a lot of money.. Hope this helps! =)|`|5jsMY4RIaa	If you do get it removed it'll be REALLY expensive. And you'll have a huge scar all across your back and arms.

I'd keep the tat.|`|2dya7YeKaa	If you like it don't get it removed.  If you don't feel it is appropriate to show in certain situations, dress to cover it.

But, on the other hand, it is going to be there for the rest of your life, so if you are not happy with it, then look into getting it removed.|`|fR2Geezcaa	It usually leaves some trace or scare for a lack of a better term. It is painful and costly as well to have it removed. <br>  <br>  If it was a smaller one or in less noticeable area then it may be worth it but to have a scar across your back, well you wanted it at one point of time in your life. Your probably better off accepting and dealing with the fact that you choose unwisely.<br>  <br>  I think their cool don't get me wrong but so far I haven't thought of anything.I would still want on my body when I'm 80 years old!

c0193f44d7d8c3dc36cdfd2185bcdb05aa	Baking soda is an EXCELLENT choice for cleansing the skin. It cleanses the skin and in the process removes excess oil and dead skin cells to allow for new, fresh skin to emerge. It also acts as a neutralizer as it balances out the skin's pH.<br>  <br>  Check out this page for more info on how to use baking soda to remove acne: <a href="http://www.skin-care-recipes-and-remedies.com/clear-acne.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skin-care-recipes-and-remedie...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|KW0zyeqiaa	yes both of them works and it don't take very long.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I use baking soda in facial cream.

74d22a359a13b539bf60f128a3450a53aa	You must look like a Sheep if 4 or 5 Women hold you down to trim your eyebrows. <br>  Look, We like a man that is groomed. And Im sure you do the three S's quite well. <br>  Add eyebrow grooming to your list. <br>  Your female friends are telling you you need it.|`|KOzYvMPsaa	Because the 3 most important things are: brows, breasts and lips. The eyes are the window to the soul. If they are blocked by huge unkept eyebrows, that's no good. The eyebrows accent the face and stand out a lot, thus, they need to be nice.|`|yyIVrngcaa	because a little facial tweeking makes all the difference believe it or not lol...<br>  You could be goregouse and Nobody will see it because some excess hair/unibrow, etc.<br>  I have also made a guy friend let me pluck his eye brows before, that unibrow was getting on my nerves!|`|XqaTkKuaaa	because its good hygiene.  Trust me if a female didn't take care of her eye brows you would notice it right away. plus it makes your eyes look nice .|`|bdiSM1UXaa	Oh, wow...You're very lucky to have a female ready to groom you. Eyebrows are very important, because they are capable of changing the expression of your face if shaped properly to allow your eyes to come out. This is more true for women than men, but men need some attention to that area as well. I'm sure most if not all male celebrities have professionals to pluck their eyebrows. Trust the ladies and if you don't, go to a professional. Someone reputable in this area can create miracles on your face.|`|Bc3htRBYaa	Because girls don't like to have a heavy hairy eyebrow in which covers their face more. it looks more feminine and cute to have a thin eyebrow.<br>  Also, we hate that unibrow look. lol believe me, a friend of mine wont stop trimming her husbands eyebrow because we just don't like the look of it. . . face it.|`|IxOP4qbYaa	Personally, I don't think guys should get their eyebrows done.<br>  Women take notice of every little thing, so it's only natural for them to be obsessed with shaping their eyebrows.<br>  <br>  Answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AutbD1ZWXWDFgvtz6wibF1Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225092439AArd12v">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5EwMfGoWaa	most women are obsessed with their appearance. so everything on face counts! apparently if their big and bushy their "ugly" but of course it doesn't matter at all.<br>  if their huge i think their abit odd, or mega thing.<br>  but most of the time i look for personality, not eyebrows!<br>  xxx|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	because it is you shouldnt be asking. if you seen someone with nostril/ ear  hair what would you think? someone that doesnt take care of themselves and doesnt take time to look in the mirror. also toe hair lol|`|823Z8NH3aa	Because women don't like bushmen eyebrows.

I also find that my hair stays straighter for longer.    Good Luck x|`|0S7XXwhjaa	Heat protection tends to give longer lasting results and ensures your hair remains smooth and sleek ^^, using any hair straighteners without heat protection really damages it, it's like going out in the sun enhances vit D production but without suffice sunblock it can really damage the skin, good luck :)
pbVPS24zaa	(I'm athiest) Your parents created you. As the people said above it is where you are located. Not all black people have nappy hair, I find many others who have better hair than mine.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	uhhh because black people originated from africa, which is very hot which explains the dark hair skin/ curly hair. People that originated from colder areas have straight hair and light skin...|`|KjF0p72naa	We are each made in His image. If you insult yourself you insult His glory throghout creation. You are His handiwork and you are beautiful.    Some of the genetics in different people have to do with the origin of their ancestors and the surrounding environment that people first found themselves I believe.     But most important is that you learn to love the you that was created.  It's only one chance to live life here. Be proud of who you are and ask for help from friends or family or online here if you need ideas on how to style your hair in a new way if you don't like your current style.   Be happy.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	i believe african americans have the hair type they do because in the part of the world they originate from the sun is alot closer and hotter, and this hair type helps to reflect the sun and keep the body cooler.|`|HHnQyjFBaa	I'm sorry, but people come from evolution. "God" didn't just decide to get down from his big chair and create people. If Adam and Eve really were the first people on Earth, our generation would not be here. People have evolved from tiny bacteria. And Earth was created from science. it got caught by the sun's gravity force and is now orbiting it. Seriously, people.    The reason why black people have nappy hair is because they come from a very hot, dry place. Why do some people have greasy hair? It's the same thing. I think black people's hair is beautiful.

ikXqf20saa	You can still have a personal style, but what you're wearing now probably doesn't express your personality.    Start shopping at feminine stores, read magazines, have fun with your clothes! Charlotte Russe is a really great store for women, but aim AWAY from the T-shirts.    You could try A-line skirts, pencil skirts, cardigans, dress pants, bubble tops, trnch coats, ETC!  I don't want to tell you to look just like the girls in the magazines, but you need some class.    You can keep your jeans too, just as long as their dark-wash.  light wash jeans make your legs look wider..    And last but not least, get into the habit of watching what not to wear. They give different proportioned women ideas for clothing :]

jUuYMVqiaa	the salon dye is best for your hair, least damaging and lasts much longer...but if you Must do it yourself, then get garniar fructise|`|KW0zyeqiaa	well if u ask me the best dye for your hair is the natural color of your hair.
I6zQeNGzaa	Yes it's possible you could go bald later.   Both of my grandfathers had a full head of hair, my dad is bald . I have two brothers , one has premature balding (he's 29 but started losing his hair at 26 just like my dad did) and one still has a full head of hair (he's 26). Neither of them have hair like my dad. I suppose it something to do with an inherited gene. One inherited the gene and the other didnt.   The same with you, You could have inherited the gene or maybe you didn't. It's too early to tell right now. Most people start premature balding around 25 so it's possible you could start then .  The best thing you can do right now is take vitamins for your hair.  A multivitamin with a MSM, Biotin, & Silica supplement will go a long way in helping prevent baldness.
9lldaKNVaa	im almost 15 too and the best bathingsuits are definitley at pacsun http://shop.pacsun.com/suits/index.cat (they are somewhat expensive though). american eagle  http://www.ae.com/web/browse/category_fu... would also fit (they have a cute summer line) hope this helped.|`|DySUxIn4aa	Ask your mom what is appropriate.

Goodluck! :D|`|OvsgyxxDaa	kinda like a heart/oval.   yes it would look good! :)|`|ItJhWTCBaa	A combination of heart and square.=D|`|nD00reA5aa	its kinda oval/heart, and you would look really good with side bangs.|`|xAdOhtaoaa	its heart shaped. and dont get side bangs. you are pretty just the way you are.|`|LKKSSLl5aa	it's and oval and yes you would look good with side bangs|`|njrsXjIkaa	dont!! i have side bangs and now im dying for my hair to grow out like yours!|`|Ah5KDMALaa	lovely bubbly
4DgEnlKZaa	I have been using the Neutrogena Skin ID System for 2 weeks. My acne has reduced, but my skin is extremely dry from the treatment. If you have sensitive skin, I suggest you do not buy this. I have the Cream Cleanser (14), the anti-acne treatment (32), and the hydrator (72). The Cream Cleanser and the hydrator are both contain salicylic acid, which drys out your skin. A free spot treatment also comes with it, which contains salicylic acid. 3 out of the 4 products I was sent contain salicylic acid, so it's like I am just using the same thing 3 times. I am going to cancel my account, because I don't think it is worth the money. I suggest you go to your dermatologist and get acne cream, like Differin, or see what your dermatologist thinks you should do. Skin ID works, but it makes my skin so dry I only use it once a day, and some days I don't use it because my skin is so dry. You should not waste money on Skin ID.

I suggest you go to your dermatologist and get acne cream, like Differin, or see what your dermatologist thinks you should do. Skin ID works, but it makes my skin so dry I only use it once a day, and some days I don't use it because my skin is so dry. You should not waste money on Skin ID.|`|5vEKV1Dwaa	yes it did for me! I love it, I have clear skin    I recommend it :)

OvsgyxxDaa	get an ice cube to reduce swelling.  and then apply like on the spot ointments or something and apply it right to the pimple. or you can use toothpaste if you have any (the paste not gel) try not to touch it from now on and be sure to keep the paste on it!!! :)you can also try opening the pore by standing over a pot of boiling water and get the steam to open the pore then apply the cremes to it so it works better inside. and you can also just wash your face with hot water but rinse with cold to close the poor.  be sure to drink water from now on! no coffee or soda, try to stay away from dairy, try to be happy and not stressed (stress can lead to pimples :P) and sleep at least 8 hours!  try putting concealer on it too.|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	Makeup.|`|0S7XXwhjaa	the best solution is to steam the spot gently to open the pore which would ease out the sebum and toxins within the pore, wash your face with cold water then tone and moisturise and try not to pick at it.    use a gentle antibacterial cream such as sudocreme or savlon which aids in clearing out the bacteria, Toothpaste can really aggravate the spot due to its high alkali content, overnight it may appear to help the skin but it dries it out excessively and because the skin has been treated abrasively it may trigger further breakouts on that section of skin.  Hope this helps :)   Kelly
OsHjXzxUaa	if its regular polish like 5 days|`|9lldaKNVaa	color usually stays on without chipping for a week and a half (if your careful) and the color will be there for a few months wthout taking it off. but if you want it to not chip, use a clear coat every two days. hope this helped : ]|`|QnSKaBcjaa	if they are fake nails they will make it a week and a half to two weeks but they will start to dull toward the end. real only last a few days but look way better i think|`|oKZ3GstXaa	well if its on acrylics they last like 2, 3 weeks but if they are just on your real nails probably like a week at most. i always put a extra clear coat on them the polish seems to last longer|`|snOPKSecaa	well what was the original color?|`|3e3dfe2723cd01184ea5fa6bd0781a53aa	the regular nailpolish stays on for like 5-8 days but the ones that they put under the shiney stuff stays on for as long as you have them on.|`|bTZ4Ba99aa	Its depending on the shop you went to. But it should stay for a while! I always get my nails done and painted and the polish stays on for quite a while.    hope i could be of assistance    :P|`|kcf16Wvwaa	manicure polish-6 days  reg. polish-4 days  (and still have their full color)  it takes about 2 months to take off polish that you don't touch and just let it be there!!!

t09RDgGfaa	Okay u sound pretty awesome to me! Im just like that... Dont worry and try to change yourself aero and ab\bercrombie are really popular here Its cold here too! I suggest really light or really dark skinny jeans, ugg or any other kind of furry winter boots. Layers are every thing try any dark color long sleeve shirt like blue or purple and a cute aero tee in a bright color and cute zio up hoodie that is my go to outfit and dont worry girls can be mean b/c their jealous!|`|AA10025824	Be yourself, people will love you for it even if they don't show it at first.|`|ePT3hRO0aa	okay so wait, exactly what is your question?  ..  you should try being your self you dont need to 'reinvent' your self|`|CEENX0sDaa	i think u should be urself and not listen to anyone    besides arent you too young to be on yahoo answers?|`|yPkZX6x7aa	Just wear some regular clothes your first couple days until you see what everyone else is wearing O.o|`|AW1OWmOtaa	Wear what you're comfortable in and things that make you feel good! There is no point trying to make yourself fit into someone elses image. Don't change who you are to suit other people it won't make you any happier!    If you just want a new wardrobe don't go looking for certain styles just pick things that you like and are comfortable in no matter whether they are "preppy" or any other stupid category! If you want your own style get out there and find it :)|`|eDAX46b9aa	You should ask around. Ask what style is best in middle school. Use all the comments to come up with one flirty look. I am going to deal with the same problem, except i don't really have a style. I just throw stuff together if i think it will look good. Don't think about what you have. Just take stuff and put it on to experiment. Wake up a little early on the first day, or the night before and put together an outfit that is unique and not like anybody else's. People will be rushing towards you when you come to school wearing a bangin' outfit! Don't tell them and be mysterious. Pretty soon the entire school will be on your side and you'll be part of the "it" crew! Good luck dealing with your fashion crisis!!|`|F6Ye0El8aa	Lilly from Hannah Montannah  I think your a nice enough girl =]  [i would so hang with you! ;?]|`|oKZ3GstXaa	just be your self if you shop at abercrombie you should have great taste already|`|lb8FBhWnaa	umm your normal|`|BkucBPwjaa	Dont be scared middle school is awsome im a seventh grade here middle school is 7 and 8th grade  but justy b yourself you sound pretty cool its ok to change a little bit but dont loose who you really r the people who think your weird arent woth being friends with good luck in middle school!!!!|`|U3iOlXpVaa	I would go to stores and try different outfits and styles until you find one you really like|`|QQdOpG2xaa	....i think you should try... being yourself,   don't be what others want you to be, I have crazzy style, but my friends lurve me because of it,  dress you want to dress,  don't be a fake! fakers suck!  i have emo friends, and i dress emo at times, don't ever say theyre gross,  what a loser thing to say|`|atAwNvDfaa	First of all, calm down! Why are you, like, yelling? If you have to ask us what your new style should be, you must be really self conscious. Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the people that make fun of you are just jealous? And don't think "No way! They're not jealous" because if anything else, other people are jealous that you can just be yourself and your not trying to be someone else or look like someone else. That is a beautiful trait so don't lose it. I am finishing middle school, so i know. Just be yourself! My style is pretty simple. Sweatshirts with jeans and vans shoes or uggs, or in warmer weather maybe bermuta shorts with a graphic tee or tank. Try to stay away from brand names. People will think your cool or you will think people with think that, but basically all you're doing is just advertising the store and it's not really your own style if everyone else is wearing it. A few things from brand name stores is nice to make you feel good, thouh :)|`|pQi3xtZgaa	Yer a total prep. Even though your tomboyish, everything you said was screaming 'PREPPIE!!' So, go with the flow of how you are, and you'll be fine.    BTW Im an emo kid so if you dont care about my opinion because Im different, okay. But your only in 5th grade, so you probably dont really care. ^_^|`|drzLhGG1aa	I don't wanna sound like ur mother, but before u buy something, make sure u like it. Anyway. Skinny jeans are awesome. Layered Tanks in bright colors. Babydoll (like when it's sinched under the chest and then flares out) T-s and Tanks. Graphic T-s... just shirts w/ cute little icons on them. Flats with cute patterns. UGGs. Simple colored flip-flops. Plaid bermudas. Plaid shorty shorts. Plain neutral (tan, brown, navy) shorty shorts. Zip-up hoodies. Pendant necklaces. Fashion scarves.    Hope I helped! Have fun!|`|TbQEskNyaa	Omg you are just like me !  i just left middle school and now i go to a upper school i was really nervous i didn't fit in for the first few weeks because i wasn't acting myself so after a while i decided to act how i felt i should i wouldn't change for anyone. So after a while people started accepting me for who i really am now i get on with everyone and i hang around with the people who have always stuck by me so if i where you act how you i would stay the same if people have a problem with you why should you care its not exactly your loss its there's for loosing some one who could be a great friend and tbhits good to be different maybe your just unique x|`|cRoOlMZUaa	Hey, im in high school so i thought i might be able to help you!  being a neat freak is GOOD!! trust me it will come in handy in the future  a small group of really good friends is the best, you always know you can trust them  try to stay away from stores like Aeropostale and abercrombie, when you shop there you buy things because of the name. buy clothes for the way they look, not by who they are made by....no one is going to be lookin at the tags!! lol  i love purple too!|`|lm4oiiv6aa	okay, so here is a list of good stores-  Hollister, Old Navy, Abercrombie/ Abercrombie and Fitch,Aeropostalle,  Victorias Secret(PINK), Rue 21, Forever 21, and other places that your friends shop. if you dont know what looks cute, then it is OK to copy the manniquins. to me you seen like a prep, if you want to reinvent your personality but still be yourself, then the main thing you have to do is pay attention to other people. If they are giving each other weird looks when you say or do something then its simple, just dont do those things anymore. you should still be yourself. BE NICE TO EVERYONE, or you really will be labeled as a brat. people in MS can be really mean, but the more you show that you are hurt the more you will be teased. But it honestly isnt that terrible, so dont be too nervous, and on the first day try and meet as many people as possible. you seem like a nice person so you will probably have a lot of friends. DO NOT get off-track on your school work!! beleive me, i did in the beginning of 6th and there were a LOT of consequences. and try this wiki article, it helped me!!(im in 7th grade)  http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-Middle-Sc...  Have fun!!!
