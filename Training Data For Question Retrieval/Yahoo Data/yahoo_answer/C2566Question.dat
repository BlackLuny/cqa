20090223141206AAlNnBC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	99 chevy lumina idling extremely erratic?	Hey all-       I have a 1999 Chevy Lumina, 3800 model, with 200k+ miles on it. about 3 weeks ago it started idling very erratic, but only when at a stop in drive, or in park. When i would come to a stop, the RPM's would drop from standard 900-1000k sharply down to 4-500, then right back up to 1000. but then sometimes, when i would go to engage the gas, the engine would shudder, back and forth from 500 to 1000 and shake the whole car. Also, sometimes, when i would put the car in park, it would rev up to 1500, then fall down and stall out. I took it to my mechanic, and he replaced the fuel pump and fuel filter ($600). It is still doing the exact same thing, but not stalling out as often as before. Any recommendations as to what it could be?       Thanks in advance for any and all help- i greatly need it

I have a 2.5 four cylinder, m5 speed, 1991 chevy s-10 that constantly clogs the air filter with oil. It has 70,000 miles and gets serviced regularly.

I bought a car from one of my exs and he has yet to hand me the title to the car. He won't call the lender so I've been calling to see if or when the title has been released to him and they won't give me any information. The lender says I have to talk to him or have him call because he is still the owner of the vehicle.  Now that they've told me this, I've called and called and sent text messages to him and is not getting any response back from him. So, I am thinking that if I give him the car back, how would I go about getting my money back since he's already cashed the check that I wrote out to him for the car? or if he won't give me the money back, what can I do, LEGALLY... to get my money back? Is there anything I can do to get it back? or am I just SOL? Please help???
