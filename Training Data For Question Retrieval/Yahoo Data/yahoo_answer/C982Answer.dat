T7DRcINtaa	Sort of, but depending on the dependability of these players.  If Detriot could work with what they had left then they would have the most benefits.  But this is getting rid of a huge chunk of the Pistons team, so this would be complex, and the Suns wouldn't be dropping much, but I think it could be a fair overall trade.|`|FDl2HUEsaa	detriot-a+ all they lose is rip and sheed and get lebron<br>  suns-a+ they get sheed and lamar for shaq who is retirering in 2 years and a rookie thats a great deal<br>  cavs-d yeah they get shaq and rip but for the best player and really sasha would have to start at small<br>  lakers-a they lose a old power forward and gain a young power froward and a knokdown shooter|`|URFzyGdLaa	No not at all. Look at it this way the Cavs loose their best player; the lakers loose lamar odem a decent player and get nothing back except Szcarbiak who they don't need cause they have Gasol and Bynum; Suns loose Shaq one of the best centers to ever play the game; And the only real people who gain are the pistons with lebron but they are doing fine with Alen Iverson so there is no use;<br>  THIS IS A BAD TRADE OVERALL!!!!!!!|`|83Y2YbXvaa	Im going to say it is a good trade. I think the fans are going to benefit from it the most. it should make for some good games and some fresh names in the finals.|`|hG58emVDaa	Def phoenix wow... easy question..|`|eF60R7DPaa	that sucks for the cavs and lakers...shaqs good but getting old

cf097e014c6acfacb1c669aa3ee29effaa	I personally think PP's best facet of his game is his ability to keep his head in pressure situations. His athleticism is below-par, as is his dribbling, speed, assisting and sportsmanship. He CAN shoot and create his own shot but the guy needs to lose some weight and the chip on his shoulder that comes from being with the C's for 10yrs. Let's not forget they were one of the worst teams EVER before the Garnett/Allen trade.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Pierce has to be considered Tier 1. When he took the amount of shots Kobe did, his scoring average, was the same, with more boards. You can't downgrade him just because he takes 13 shots to Kobe's 20. He showed in Game 7 against Cleveland his ability to take over a game, and get his team a big win when they need it most.<br>  <br>  That sounds like a Tier 1 player to me.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Right ouside the first level. He's a level above T-Mac, Carmelo and Iverson (Bosh is ahead of all three of these guys..) But not on the same level as Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Duncan, Paul, Howard, etc.|`|jjzK1pOaaa	he would be in the 4th level...why?simply cause he has 2 other superstars to take care of him when he doesnt do good...and he couldnt win anything on his own and wanted to be traded...hes a cry baby and he thinks hes better than he really is...|`|rZmiyAqJaa	anybody who doesn't KNOW that Pierce is one of the truley ELITE PLAYERS in the leauge is either delusional or a sore in the a*s lakers fan who can't see beyond their own kobe.|`|HIfs0vgzaa	I really hate Paul Pierce even though I like the Celtics but I'm gonna have to put him at 2 there with Melo and Iverson.|`|FDl2HUEsaa	rose is not a 3 player billups is in 2 but peirce would be a three so would kg and you forgot chris paul in the ones|`|qRGbxJ5Caa	The only place DWhistle belongs at number one is at suckin c**k and giving his wife STDs.

15wwA3jjaa	I can't believe he wasted another 3 years of his career in a dump like Oakland.  God he could have received top dollar from an actual contender, he is either very dumb, or just doesn't care about winning a championship.|`|F934e4HQaa	Al Davis has lost it.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	While I don't normally support any of Al Davis' eccentricities, I think Nnamdi deserved it. He's absolutely incredible. Lechler though, makes me wonder if someone's putting something in Davis' food.|`|AA12185087	To that Daniel guy,<br>  <br>  Nnamdi is what people call a class act. He is not like Randy Moss who just quits on the team (just because things aren't going how he wants them to go) and then goes to a very good team like the cheatriots. This goes to show that Nnamdi is not selfish and he actually cares about winning the big one with a team like the Raiders.|`|Lcnc8952aa	Al Davis is a crazy character. Let's hope Nnamdi can keep it up.|`|yLAH35rhaa	i wonder how much cap space is left for the raiders|`|dCbIHBpGaa	The Raiders have two pro bowl players and they made sure they kept 'em both, seems like good business to me! Corner is a tricky position and its too easy to pay good money for a bust (Hall anyone?) so I reckon if you have one of the very best then its money well spent. I think giving Cable a chance was a good move and these two signings were good also... a few good decisions in a row from Big Al, maybe he is having a comeback!
piZ4xDBqaa	Bowen has lost a step, too.  He'll be rested for the playoffs, but don't expect the same lock-down defense we've seen in previous years.  He'll be good in stretches, but Pop will have to make sure he's not overexposed.|`|qPGd4qbXaa	If they rest him now he'll be more efficient for the Playoffs so it's a good move!|`|GswnLKtQaa	I don't think so, he's old (no disrespect to bowen and the spurs fans) he can't guard kobe or guys like lebron, cp3, wade anymore. <br>  <br>  in last years playoffs bowen couldn't stop kobe, udoka will be the one for the job or even manu.
4L8h8Rp9aa	They are measured with and without shoes, but they only list their heights with shoes. Michael Beasley surprised NBA scouts at least year's combine because he was only 6'7" without shoes. But after putting on shoes and getting a little "help", he was listed at 6'9".|`|E5XFKorjaa	what does it matter???<br>  Nate is 5-9 by the way.<br>  it is measured without shoes i beleive.|`|4tEyyM6Daa	they all lie about their height|`|jRRTdT4uaa	there height is listed without shoes on because that is there real height
tzrLDbHWaa	I'd say Tavaris Jackson.  I know a lot of people seem to hate on him, myself included, but he actually showed some promise at the end of last season, until he had his worst game in the playoffs vs the Eagles.  He doesn't seem to be that bad, and if Childress would have stuck with him the whole season, he may have worked through it.  They're going to need a long term solution, and I think giving Jackson the chance to be that solution is better than keeping him on the bench and going with someone who may or may not be good for 1 more year.<br>  <br>  And, what are your other options?<br>  <br>  Gus Frerotte?  For anyone who thinks Frerotte is the answer, look at his stats from last year.  He threw more picks than TDs, had a completion percentage just as bad as Jackson, but an AWFUL 73.7 rating.  The Vikings are going to be primarily a rushing team with Peterson, and they don't need a QB to win games for them, they need a QB who won't lose them.  No QB threw a higher percentage of INT's than Frerotte, and that's how a QB can lose a game for you.  He is NOT the answer.  He's also 37.<br>  <br>  Matt Cassel?  No, just no.  He's really not all that good.  Bernard Berrian and Bobby Wade are not Randy Moss and Wes Welker.  I don't care how good his stats were in NE, he had a great offense with top recievers and a team that primarily passed the ball.  Granted, he could be the type that wouldn't lose the game, but do you want to pay NE's high asking price in a trade for Cassel in addition to 14.6 million next year for a QB to not lose the game for you.  Jackson can do that for you much cheaper.<br>  <br>  Jeff Garcia?  Well, first of all, he's 38, so not the QB of the future by any means.  He did as well as one could hope with that team.  He could be a one year solution at most, but his asking price may be a tad high, since I'd expect some other interest from the Jets, since they need a QB and even if they draft Sanchez, he wont be ready.  He may be a little better than Jackson, but I think Jackson is the longterm solution and he needs experience.<br>  <br>  Michael Vick?  Yes, he's still out there.  He won't be too expensive and he would actually fit in perfectly with the Vikings rushing attack.  The downside?  Well, no clue if Goodell will let him back without suspension, and you're trying to get public funding for a new stadium, maybe not the best PR when you're trying to get the locals to support you.|`|4kdlE54Paa	For at least a one year fix, Jeff Garcia would be a great choice.  He works well in that type of offense, consistant, and does control the offense well.  The Vikings can give him the protection he needs.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|15wwA3jjaa	I honestly think they should bring Gus Frerotte back as their starter... I mean the guy finished 8-3 as a starter before getting injured and being benched for that bum Tarvaris Jackson.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Gus Frerotte. He helps continue the Viking tradition - sucking.|`|nAtBuBRhaa	Matt Cassel is really the best fit in my opinion. I think he'd do great with the Vikings. Jerry Garcia is not a franchise quarterback anymore at 37, and Matt Cassel is hot right now. And with Adrian Peterson and that defense, they can do some big things. And they got a very weak division, with the Bears, Packers and Lions. Rex Grossman is the alternative choice. Maybe under a more guided offense, with more weapons, such as Adrian Peterson. He also has experience with Bernard Berrian, when he played in Chicago. So, I think Matt Cassel is the best choice. And then Rex Grossman. If not that, they can pick up a quarterback in a draft.|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	in a perfect world, tarvaris jackson but they may need to bring in jeff garcia for the year so tarvaris can get more time learning the offense... tarvaris is not bad by any means but a temporary upgrade like garcia or warner would help tarvaris and the team in the future i guess...<br>  <br>  also matt cassel popped in my mind and i think he would be a great fit but im not sure he would really be a big improvement i mean he led a 16-0 team to 11-5 limping into the playoffs... not to diss i have respect for him but if were looking for an upgrade from tarvaris i would say they are about the same haha since they both showed great promise at the end of the season|`|4L8h8Rp9aa	If Kerry Collins doesn't resign with the Titans, the Vikings should go after him. He has taken a team to a Super Bowl before, and he would come at a cheap price (unlike Matt Cassel who is signed to a $14 million salary next year). He still has a strong arm and can get the ball downfield to Bernard Berrian, Minnesota's best big play threat.|`|tWUQU4Juaa	Well the Coach and GM seem to want Tavaris Jackson . If they dump him for somebody else it will make them look like idiots . If fact that is the biggest problem with the Vikings . They made a stupid choice with that guy and don't want to admit it . In reality he wouldn't even be a decent 3rd stringer .|`|4XdevoVwaa	Jeff Garcia, he is a good QB that has won before and doesn't make too many mistakes.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Jeff Garcia is the best fit. Hes a great qb and if he gose to the Vikings he light that team up.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I think they should try to get a veteran, not of the 37 year old washed up variety, but of the Matt Cassel variety.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	I would pick Jeff Garcia out of what is left right now, and maybe aim for Maclin in the draft.   That would give Garcia two guys who can put up huge yards after the catch and could fit in a west coast style.   Wade and Rice would be perfect possession complements.<br>  <br>  Daniel-  Gus Frerotte posted horrible numbers.  He didnt lead the Vikings to an 8-3 record, the Vikings got that record dispite him.  I would give Booty a shot over him.

Now if you are old enough to remember them both in their prime, the question is who did you prefer? Magic's triple doubles or Jordan's 40 point nights?<br>  I prefer Magic, so I prefer LeBron!|`|fWMzd7y5aa	Kobe is the best player overall. Then LeBron is very close though.

UxSF3Doaaa	It is SOOOOO nice for a change to read a story and the media puts teenagers in a POSITIVE light.<br>  <br>  I ask of everyone's forgiveness, but it's like adults all the time talk so much about how horrible the youth is, and so focused on that that they fail to take enough time to think about the positives of the youths.<br>  I mean wisdom, flaws, and goodness comes from ALL ages, and it would be wrong to stereotype each age group. I also know lots of people don't like admitting when someone younger, ESPECIALLY much younger, can posses more wisdom than them. I will admit, I have a few teenage contacts on here I can learn from. There are some teens and young kids who can put some adults to shame with wisdom. I once read a story about a single mom who got laid off or something, and she could not provide Christmas presents for her young daughters. They told their mom "It's ok!" Yet, heck forbid some adults have to go without some piece of expensive material.<br>  <br>  Thanks for sharing this story, and let us adults remember to ALWAYS take more time focusing on the good things in youth. I don't want to sound mean or anything, but there are adults who can actually learn some wisdom from some of the youths.|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	I read that too. So sweet.

Om7cjg5qaa	I would agree with Greg Pop....Mikki Moore is not a player that would be a good fit for the Spurs system. The best players that the Spurs could have picked up would have probably been Rasheed Wallace, Marcus Camby, or maybe even David Lee. These guys can post up and play solid defense. Mikki Moore would be like having Fabricio Oberto but less. Of course Fab is more of a fundamental and he has more experience. It wouldn't be a good pick for the Spurs.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	No...

obPSaYf3aa	Since public opinion is not a serious forum because at least 99% of the US population do not know him personally, I don't care what people that never met him think.  They can believe everything the media says, if they want, because it's mostly hearsay and evidence is circumstantial.  The media has something against Barry just because he does not grant an "easy" interview or photo op.  Then when the steroids/PED allegations came up, they started making stories up about how he is a "junkie" or "abuser", which is false because he's not dead or crippled.<br>  <br>  I met him in our neighborhood (San Mateo/Foster City, CA) where he also grew up and went to HS, at my place of employment (EA Sports), as an invited guest of his All Star Game afterparty and SF Giants community events, as well as an occasional visitor to the SF Giants locker room as a corporate perk.  He will shake your hand, take time to chat, will sign autographs, joke around and does not walk around like he's above God.  The media does not want the public to know that!  <br>  <br>  Anyways, he does not have a "nice" clause in any of his contracts so he's free to act any way he wants to.....  He does not have to grant every or any interview or photo op request from the media.<br>  <br>  With only speculation, hearsay and circumstantial evidence, he may get a guilty verdict on maybe one count, but for the others, either innocent or just plain acquitted.|`|tWUQU4Juaa	Being found not guilty does not make someone innocent . Remember OJ was found not guilty but the whole world knew he was a piece of sh*t murderer . People with money hire lawyers who do whatever they can to get low-down guilty @ssholes out of trouble .

N7fNwIQSaa	.....was that a backhanded compliment for Arsenal....      Q2: There have been so many different fees publish but most likely from 12-15 million....but most likely 15|`|LReOvHEdaa	Arsenal is closest to Barca than any other club when we talk about quality of football.  Thats the worst BS I have heard so far.. Please dont compare team which rely on team effort to a team which rely on individual brilliance.  Arshavin should perform well hopefully.    OQ2:i think its 12 million with 3-4 million add ons.    Edit:Barca relies on buying big stars (indiviudal brilliance) while Arshavin's transfer is supposed to have broken club records..(16 million)|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	They reckon 13million plus 2million in add on's.  He will be a big hit for us, i've seen his style of play and he'ss fit in perfectly|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Yes he should fit in well.    Q2: Not confirmed yet i've heard many different prices.|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	I belive it was within the region of 12.5 mill, but i only looked this morning.    I think Arsenal is the best english club he can hope for. He is flexible, and plays good through ball football which arsenal feed off of. Take their win in the champions league against Fenebahce. they scored 5 or 6 goals mostly from crosses and through balls.    I still think he might have benefitted from going to spain where through ball football is at an all time high, but Barca havent a space, and teams like Sevilla and Villareal are not doing well with recent results this year.    It was a wise move. I dont see him as a saviour, but it will benefit Arsenal, and ultimately his playing career.|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	yes i think it is a GOD place for him.|`|P5G3afbZaa	i think so|`|QVEHBMp3aa	I cant imagine him having a better man manager.  Wenger has a habit of getting the best out of young players, and making them superstars.    Q2 - 15 Million apparently|`|WK8887Tsaa	Yes. Will be untouchable while he settles in, because he's the big name everyone has wanted, and then will be a fantastic player.    For his profile, he could become one of the best rated players in the world, especially if Arsenal have a late season run like last season (remember they only finished 4 points off the top). It's quite possible for them to do something similar and he would get the credit.    As for the price, I believe it is around 16.5m. But I think Arsenal only pay around 12m, with the rest made up by Arshavin buying out his own contract, and not demanding the bonuses owed to him.|`|eda1e3044f3b72caa810590b84628887aa	Church is|`|3zbGNp4maa	Better than Diaby or Eboue playing the flanks.|`|tLiR81hdaa	yes

Idk, it just seems that a talent as big as Modric and one as big as Arshavin should do well in the Premiership.|`|LReOvHEdaa	hahahahhahaa Its spurs dammit..

He will be a success. The majority of players who have joined spurs have been bad.|`|Hiasgb75aa	If Modric isn't performing its his fault. But he has done well recently. Arshavin didn't actually play very well towards the end of the russian league anyway|`|WK8887Tsaa	No. Arshavin will only get better under Wenger. As does everyone. Modric was stuck with Ramos, and the (unfulfilled) promise of Champions League football.    However, Modric has started to rediscover his form since Redknapp went there, so don't write him off too quickly|`|AA12370193	Arsenal - Spurs  two different clubs|`|KOsGtal8aa	arsenal should have got Modric, no doubt. but trust in wenger, he is the only manager in the world that can turn water into wine.|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	Not really. I think Modric was overestimated. Dont get me wrong, Modric is a good player and he tries his best some days i think he works the hardest on pitch in the spurs squad. But he isnt comfortable in the premier league. He either needs to go to a more fmailar leage or join a team that suits his style of football.    I doubt Arshavin will end up the same way. I think playing in the premiership will actually make him more experienced, and as he has been a captain for Russia and been player of Euro 2008, i think he can be noticed as one of the best players in the world. He was the most valued player in the Russian leagues, and that says a lot considering that Danni was an expensive signing for Zenit earlier this season.     Then again, he could turn out like Ronaldinho at Milan. He is a top player but it isnt as exciting as before. He is still a good player but to stay alive you need to keep up with the changes in football. I believe Arshavin can do that. We will have to see.     Apologies for the Essay but whenever somebody talks about Arshavin it interests me very much :)|`|m2zXOREJaa	It's a pity as when he flew in,he was looking for the delegation of Arsenal to meet him and where were they?Mind you what did he see?   SNOW-he must've thought he was at home and decided to pis off,the last i heard theres been a plane circling Manchester for the last 18hours.lol|`|KR3IvxNwaa	Arsenal is always the right club for patient player. Modric ruined his career because he joins Spurs not Arsenal. i believe Wenger and Arshavin made the right decision.    impatient player like Diarra, Flamini, Cole will regret leaving Arsenal.|`|N7fNwIQSaa	No no no no no you know Arshavin is already quite old so hes moulded already...i just hope moulded the Arsenal way|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	knob head,how can you compare the two players for a start,plus the two managers you can't compare and lastly how dare you put the spuds in the same category as the arsenal,you truly are a man who has no idea  what his talking about, you should be in the jokes section|`|SoKd4jGAaa	Wenger is the best coach in football history, he will allow him to expand his creativity. It reminds me of the Carlos Tevez affair too.    Modric would have been better at somewhere like CSK, Arsenal or Almeria.

mJFgCvYlaa	The quick answer to your question is: Keep riding, the more you ride eventually you'll be able to climb that hill the entire way without problems. Like the others, there's no shame in having to walk uphill, I've seen plenty people do that and the least I would do is cheer for them silently. Just keep riding the same route over and over, familiarity with the route helps you to anticipate the stops, traffic, etc so you can focus your efforts on climbing.  Here are some tips to help you climb hills.     1. First, you need to relax your upper body as much as you can, so you can focus your strength climbing, not wobbling and gripping the handlebars. Like in yoga, first relax your face, relax your shoulders, your arms, your hands grip. Then sit more upright to keep your chest open to breathe, then focus your efforts on steady, smooth pedaling at a easy gear.    2. Don't keep thinking how hard climbing is, and distracting thought of this is impossible, etc. I chant in my head "There is no hill" and just focus on that steady pedaling.     3. Make sure you are in an easy gear, and shift before you approach the hill.     4. If its a long steady climb, don't go all out in the beginning. Prepare yourself for a long steady climb at a maintainable pace. If its a short hill, what you can do before the climb is pedal faster, and use your momentum and keep pedaling, that cuts the climb greatly and makes it easier for you.    5. Learn how to pedal standing up. They work great for short bursts for short hills, but for long climbs as well since you can relieve some pressure off your bottom and work different muscles.    Keep Riding!|`|Z5xgSATSaa	The good news is that at 17 it takes less time to get in shape than when you are my age. Going up hills may seem difficult, but it is just a question of choosing the right gear and taking your time going up. Many people make the mistake of of going too hard at the start of a hill and getting in trouble before they reach the top. Pacing is the key, you have to pedal at a speed you can maintain all the way to the top. Practice on flat ground will help, but to be able to climb hills on a bike, you have to practice climbing hills on a bike.|`|37evQRaDaa	I used to bike less than 2 miles to get to work, and it was all flat.  Then we moved to the other side of town, to the top of a hill.  That put me 6 miles away with a hill between me and work (besides the one I lived on).      When I first started, those hills were tough.  I could do them, but I had to use a low gear and it really had me sweating by the time I reached the top.  After a couple weeks the hill got a bit easier.  These days I rarely even think about the hill unless I'm really tired before I even get started.      Practicing could help you get used to the hill faster, but you don't necessarily need to practice. If you just start riding to school you'll get used to it.  Give yourself a bit more time when you first start so you can take the hill slow.  There is no shame in walking up the hill, but it won't develop the muscles you need to bike up the hill.  My suggestion is to bike as long as you possibly can when you're going up that hill.  That'll build up the muscles you need to conquer that hill.     As far as practice, any biking will help, but if you want to get used to that hill, practice going up hills.  Better yet, practice going up that particular hill.  The more times you climb it, the easier it will become.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	flat ground isn;t going to help    practice for climbing is - climbing    be sure you are in a low enough gear    wle.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	Ride to school and back starting now.    Try to make it up the hill every day that you ride. If you end up having to walk your bike up the hill, then do it. There's no shame in that. Eventually you will get strong enough to conquer it. You don't need any more practice than that ~ unless you really love riding and want to do more of it.|`|8zglJMdhaa	Well hills are always a problem.  When you say big hill, how big is it?  Its ok to stop in the middle of the hill or to go walking by the hill, I used to do that when the hill was way too long.  20 days ago I couldn't climb a hill to go back home, but what it helps  is to try to start climbing is as fast as possible.  What I do too is warm up, if the big hill is in the beginning o your track well then warm up by riding not so fast outside your house or nearby, when your muscles warm up is easier.  half an hour for 1 week wont be enough :S I practiced for 2 hours per day.  Try to look for another way to go back home or wait for a car to pass and ask him to let you use him as power.  Good luck  Oh and btw the guy who said you had to practice climbing, well in my personal experience that's wrong.
YHYT8qMKaa	Yeah, I was surprised about that. I thought Jimmie would be the favorite for sure. But I don't really think it matters so much. Predictions aren't always right. Carl said he was the favorite for the '06 title, but he didn't even make the chase. I believe Jeff Gordon was the favorite for the '08 title, but he didn't even win a race. And take a look at last year's Super Bowl. It seemed like everyone was so sure that the Patriots would win. The Boston Globe was already offering a 19-0 book for pre-sale. Yet the Giants won instead.<br>  <br>  Jimmie could very well win the championship this year. Not being the favorite might make Jimmie drive harder to impress his critics, which could be a good thing for him.|`|xkGfxn70aa	I think that you have got to give respect where respect has been earned, they are a awesome group and they have there stuff together so to speak.  Why do you think almost everyone wants to run a Hendrick motor. I mean look at old 50 year old Martin trying to make a come back. There's lots of scenario's so to speak that happens in the great sport of Nascar, that's what makes it so exciting! You can't judge a book by it's cover, you've got to open the book and see what's happening.|`|E4bbO2Cdaa	I think he should be the favorite, but maybe they were going with the odds on winning 4 in a row when they figured it.  I'm sort of surprised that they stopped kissing Jr's butt long enough to get on Carl's.  The media has some sort of freak love affair with the pretty boys instead of the favorites as I see it.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Carl would've been my favorite too.  He won more races than JJ last year.  He ran better than JJ in the chase but had a couples stumbles, one of which WAS his fault.  But making predictions isn't fun for me.  I'm content to sit back and watch it all unfold. If it was predictable, it wouldn't be exciting.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	No, that's the way he likes it. Less pressure.<br>  <br>  But, he does have a point.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I think maybe its just because it would be so hard to win four straight, no one's done that before.  If I were Johnson, I would be relieved, that's a lot of pressure to put on someone.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	No, I don't think he should be upset.  I think that would be a little arrogant.<br>  <br>  Johnson has had a lot of good luck, too.  Also, he started off a little slow last year, while Edwards was consistent all year.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I don't know about Jimmie, but I'm irked..<br>  I'm a Jr fan, and I know he'll have to beat Jimmie this year..<br>  I don't much care what the odds are favoring a four in a row...<br>  They change after three in a row, but NOT FOR ANY SINGLE YEAR..|`|7RUMbREoaa	Jimmie has good reasoning with the "you have to beat the best to be the best" comment.I actually think that will give that team a lot of reason to prove them wrong.They strive on that stuff.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Hmmmm...tough call. I would have picked him to be the favorite.  I would have picked anyone over Carl.  LOL  I still think Jimmie can do it though I hope he doesn't.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Not really.  I think they like "being under the radar", so to speak.  It's hard to imagine why he continually seems to be the 2nd or 3rd favorite to win by the media and fans.  I think all the other owners and teams know who they have to beat to win the championship.  The 48 team even keeps tweaking their pit crew, that should send a message that they are not just riding the wave of their previous success.  Carl, Kyle, Jeff and many others are surely capable of winning it if everything falls just right but you start to get the feeling that unless something horrible happens to the 48 team they will be right in the thick of things when they drop the green flag at Homestead once again.  The biggest thing that sticks out to me is that they have never finished worse than 5th in the final standings.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!
111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	My favorite is rock bass and bluegill. Perch is alright and I really don't care for walleye(don't tell my hubby that). Roc kbass isn't overly  "fishy". I think the small fish taste better anyways, don't you??|`|uzNm9KtYaa	Without a doubt, two fish that rate high on my menu board are the freshwater catfish/bullhead.  But when it comes to picking the best eating, I have to agree with the guys from the IN/Fisherman Magazine and Television crowd.  You would think, being a Minnesota based company, they would nominate the walleye to that position of honor.  However, if we use Al Lindner as their spokesman, the best of the freshwater table fare goes to a relative of the walleye, the yellow perch.  I agree!  Now THAT'S good eatin'.|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	Out of the freshwater fish-Salmon, smoked, i only keep about 1 salmon per season, while releasing the rest, but when i do keep one i smoke it and well it tastes amazing!<br>  <br>  I have to admit that out of fresh and saltwater fish i much prefer the taste of saltwater fish. I realize that salmon isn't a freshwater fish but its the only fish i catch in freshwater which i will take one home to smoke.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Those are both fine table fare up here in Wisconsin as well but my very favorite fish to eat is a native brook trout about 9" to 12" long.  All you do to clean them is slit the underside and pull the gills and guts out.  Wash them up and throw 'em in some butter in a pan.  Leave the head on, a little eye juice adds to the whole experience.  The delicate pink meat pulls off of the ribs with a fork and the crispy skin is the best part.  Thanks, now I'm hungry again LOL|`|cb7d8d8e1066301d27e5cac9944cfbfcaa	Walleye<br>  Perch<br>  Crappie<br>  <br>  Walleye, made like lobster: steamed, the under the broiler, served w/ drawn butter and lemon.<br>  <br>  Perch and Crappie: deep fried in seasoned Panko served w/ fries and slaw, Ice tea or Bass Ale to wash it down.|`|p9RS2Wh6aa	1) Trout<br>  2) Walleye<br>  3) Crappie<br>  4)Bluegill|`|k56mmj2eaa	Well here in arizona coming out of the colorado river.

wqP48i43aa	run two miles every day to get in good shape, then hit the Weight room for about an hour every day, lay off the soft drinks, only drink water and gatorade, challenge your self, do a lot of core training, any time your coach is calling for a player at a certain position on scout team always be the first  to say you will play it,  this will show your coach that you really wanna play and if i were you i would start rite now|`|ULw1777caa	Steroids.|`|7V79OMMHaa	He went to Destrahan which is right across the river from the high school I went to.

6YeexwvAaa	You facilitate, my friend. I think you have to decide what type of point you want to be. Just looking at the NBA, there are a number of different types of point guards.<br>  <br>  Andre Miller runs the floor, but can't shoot the outside shot consistently.<br>  Nash shoots when he's open, and rarely creates for himself.<br>  Rondo does the right stuff with defense and just gets the ball where it's needed to be.<br>  Rose creates for himself and others and will eventually be a 20 and 8 guy.<br>  A guy like T.J. Ford scores when needed but looks to get everyone involved.<br>  <br>  It just depends on how you (or your coach) want to develop. Or, just become a jack of all trades - good jumper, good penetration skills, good floor general...be a triple threat!|`|4YsD8eJ9aa	Im a starting PG for my high school team.  As a point guard to i rely on passing because my team is all outside.  I've been averaging 5 assists per night and about 4 poins.  Scoring to be hasnt been the problem, its passing at the wrong time thats gotten me in trouble.  I would consider shooting more so it will free up you teammates.  Even tho they might be having an off day, they probably can still hit shots and by getting more assists, you have to drive and shoot more.|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	When the game is a close game you should shoot it. PG are awesome!<br>  <br>  EDIT: If the game is a blowout and you are winning, then shoot some.|`|fZ38PPgSaa	well if your teammates are having bad games you should step up|`|Hvhynlftaa	Of course, if your teammates are having an off night or something like that you take control.|`|ODAgIHQkaa	if you need to score as a point guard or any position youre gonna score sooner or later it just comes with basketball|`|YeNp4m8haa	No most point guards have 10-15 ppg|`|dtGInk4Faa	Of course you need scoring, no matter what position you are. You just can't pass.|`|q0rDcTSRaa	I think stick with the pass first to get other players involved, then if they are not scoring take over the game. Just do the best job you can to help your team win.<br>  <br>  But I think the really thing here is are you guys winning games? <br>  <br>  Its not really about scoring points its about wins. If you guys are losing then definitely take over the game until they find a groove.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck

ihaCEikwaa	Because, they have a great team, great coach, great fans, great city, AND THEY HAVE 6 SUPERBOWL RINGS!!! I don't care what anyone says--im so PROUD and HAPPY for the Steelers! They deserved to win Sunday night! IM PROUD TO BE FROM PITTSBURGH!    GO STEELERS!    EDIT: PLAYED DIRTY??? DUDE -IT'S FOOTBALL!|`|6Ojpl6viaa	They think the refs are on our side.  In fact they are not.  We had two HUGE calls over turned.  Our guys were being held and face masked all game nothing called.  Our place holder got ran over and laid out, but I guess cause the guy was over 280 and just couldnt get out of his own way..  WHAT EVER.  That never happens during the season.  But the Steelers are dirty??  They get upset because they always seem to pull it out in the end.  It was our defense that won the game.  They stopped Kirk at the very end when he had the chance to do something.  The Offense gave us the chance.  Most of the year it is the other way around.    We are always going to the playoffs, but look at this.  Before the Ravens started, who did we have in our division that gave us a challenge??  Not the Browns, and so not the Beagles....LOL  Steelers are a great team, and they have real fans.  None of this band wagon crap that the other teams have.|`|ABoo1doVaa	For the same reason Steeler fans were jealous of the Giants last season.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Well, people like their home teams, and they do spend their money to see them and buy merchandise like we do, and they love their players and the happiness and fame that the Superbowl brings, as we do. So people are emotional. However, jealousy shows immaturity and ignorance, and is a personal problem. So those that can't handle it well, need some counseling.|`|ySjHowZqaa	It's because they suck without the refs help.  You know who the mvp of the game should've been?  Mvp should've been the refs cuz they helped out steelers so much|`|Tdzk4o5Iaa	No Body Cares.|`|a8745d93f495ed1006e4532daff1bc40aa	Because they are the best football franchise in the NFL; most likely also the model franchise for all professional sports!      The Steelers have been around since 1933; thru good/bad times but the Rooney family ownership has kept them consistent since about the 70's drafting excellent players, retaining coaches, etc.  Notice that they are almost always in the playoff picture each and every year.    That's why others are so envious/jealous of them.  They will ALWAYS be the best franchise in the NFL hands down.  Until the other franchises get a clue how to treat people (it's not always about the mighty $$$ - paying people enormous salaries); but they treat folks with respect and dignity.  The other franchises don't do that; so they won't be able to compare to the Steeler organization and their winning record!    GO STEELERS!  ONLY TEAM WITH 6 SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIPS!!!!!  BORN/RAISED PITTSBURGH, PA AND PROUD OF THE STEEL CITY!!!|`|kuifoznbaa	Most people think the Cardinals were cheated.  The Steelers were handed a second Super Bowl where they received the benefit of many questionable calls.|`|ar4JGfzjaa	Because of questions like this.|`|eKsgL2wkaa	No one is jealous. Actually no one seems to care.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	I wouldn't call it jealousy ~ it's more like disdain.    They're a classless organization and their fans are obnoxious. They only team I can think of that's worse is the Raiders.|`|HAVLq7IMaa	I don't want to get involved in the low blows going on here, but I just have one thing to say.    You may think we steelers fans are obnoxious or that the team didn't deserve it, or whatever you want to wrap your jealous heads around, but if you actually paid attention to our team, instead of b*tching about how the refs favored us (which is utter crap because the cardinals were pulling facemasks and sh*t all over that field,) then you'd actually see that we are the MOST LOYAL, the MOST SUPPORTIVE, and the MOST DESERVING in the NFL.    keep this in mind: there are steelers bars in numerous countries in the world, and definitely more than one in every state of the US. any other team like that? i don't think so.|`|WGvhXXFPaa	They aren't jealous, they just hate them. The Cards deserved that game. If the Steelers hadn't have played dirty, the Cards might have had a chance.|`|PITxvkdBaa	because the steelers have done something that no other team in the NFL has done. That is winning 6 super bowl championships, so there is no need to be jealous the Steelers are a great team, Nuff said!!|`|wX5xoAN8aa	To Ty above:    The Steelers didn't play dirty the Cards were just rookies. The Cards lost because the Steelers players were more confident, and because the Cards kept getting slammed with penalties.|`|603wBW5zaa	We aren't jealous; the Cards actually deserved to win that game. When Fitzgerald took over, it should have been over, and the reffing sucked, so the Steelers got another chance... great catch by Holmes, though, and congrats to the Steelers on the win.     If anybody mentions the Steel Curtain, though, they are retards.. offense won that game.     And the main reason we don't like them is because they are currently being compared to the franchise, with Bradshaw and Swann. This team is not anywhere NEAR their caliber.    again, congrats on the win and im looking forward to a great season next year|`|0WPdeB4Paa	I don't think it is jealously.  For the second time in four years people are talking more about the apparent one-sided officiating that favored the Steelers than the outstanding plays that earned the win.  Can you name any questionable calls, or non-calls, that favored the Cards?  I can't.  I can name five (5) that favored the Steelers in addition to the two (2) that that were reversed.  Additionally, Harrison should have been ejected for hitting a man on the ground.  Even biased John Madden called that one.|`|gGiTQS53aa	Because up to date the almighty Pittsburgh Seelers have proven they are the best franchise in all of Pro Sports.  I love the fact that people are complaining about maybe one or two calls against the cards, meanwhile the refs had no indisputable evidence to overturn Ben's touchdown in the first quarter (opening drive) but they did. Larry Fitzgerald's first td was actually not a catch, their was about ten more holding infractions not called against the cards, and the holding on Hartwig for the safety was a very lame call which even Deion Sanders and Warren Sapp said it wasn't a holding call, but since the Steelers fans and team have more class they don't bring that stuff up they just let the haters complain and we can sit back and enjoy the six pack.|`|AA11301375	Those who are jealous of us (Steelers) are just angry that their team cant win the big one like we did 6 times.

Six, count them, S-I-X.    Oh....they also hate our Terrible Towel.    They are jealous of both.  The NFL can't help them with the rings but they've started selling team towels mimicking ours.  See?  Everyone wants to be like us.      Don't hate us because we're beautiful.    WAY TO GO STEELERS!    (By the way...they cannot successfully mimick our great Myrone Cope Terrible Towel because 100% of the proceeds of our towel  goes to charity--and that is something the Steeler Fans are proud of, too.  Any other team towel is a pathetic attempt to be like the Steelers)

1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Sounds like a reference to ground fighting/grappling.      When you are grappling with an opponent, there are two approaches.  One person will most likely work to find the most advantageous position to apply a lock, choke, or other submission.  However, the more experienced grappler knows that such action takes energy to fight this way.  So, he will find a position that requires little energy to maintain where he can breathe, rest and let his opponent tire himself out.  Because the tired opponent will make a mistake and becomes easier to defeat.    A good example of this is Royce Gracie of BJJ in the early Ultimate Fighting competitions.  Much of the fight he would be on his back under his opponent, but like a python had him wrapped in such a way that he could rest while his opponent fought to get free.  The opponent would tire and offer the opening to a submission hold Gracie could apply and win the fight.      Hope that helps.|`|gBO908P6aa	Not to keep the opponent in your guard and tire him out?    Edit: I didn't elaborate before.  Guard position is when you are on your back with your opponent on top between your legs.  Similar to a scissor in wrestling but not quite because your aim isn't to constrict his torso, it's to control his body and hips.  There's a lot of things you can do when you have someone in your guard.  For one, you can fight back with your legs, using them in a variety of ways (X-guard, spider, closed, open, butterfly) as well as set up chokes, sweeps, locks, etc.    The reason why you the top person can tire out is he has to support his own weight over you while working to get out of the guard and create a dominant position.  In addition to that he has to worry about your legs creating problems for him and his stability.  This strategy may be good for straight grappling competition but it borders on stalling if you're simply waiting for him to tire out and also in MMA you can eat your opponent's fists if you remain stationary in the closed guard for too long.  Watching two fighters hug and cuddle each other the entire match also makes for a boring fight and the ref is surely going to say something about it.      So that phrase meant the person wanted to keep moving and working for a better position or submission, not just lay on the bottom like a log.|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	The guard basically is being on your back and your opponent inside your hips.  There are a few variants on this theme:  Classic, or closed guard - your legs are around your opponent with your ankles crossed    Butterfly - your feet are inside your opponents thighs, your knees are still to the outside of the opponent    feet on hips - your feet are on your opponent's hips    Then there are combinations, further, more complicated variations etc.    The guard is quite an effective position, it can look as if you are in an inferior position, but as long as you have control of your opponent's hips, you should be ok.
cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	I'm liking Larry English from NIU for the first round pick. After that a WR, DT, and maybe a tackle or safety.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	WR would be the obvious need, but they might address that in free agency (Houshmandzadeh?)    I think they should draft a linebacker. They need depth and youth at that position.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I think they need a WR.  I wish they picked earlier, though.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	This may sound crazy,but what about a WR that seem to be the biggest need.|`|UxooffHZaa	I think they'll go with a Wide Receiver. Percy Harvin or Hakeem Nicks. Whoever they have rated higher and who falls to them.

PMluTf72aa	i gave up on these early predictions last year.  about half the teams in the league will surprise everyone.  if you want evidence to that: the Cardinals reached the Super Bowl and the Dolphins, after going 1-15, won the AFC East.  you have to wait until after the draft at least to make any predictions.  changes are still taking place.  for example, my Packers just changed their entire defensive scheme to the 3-4 and they revamped the entire coaching staff on the defense.  how will that fare in Green Bay?  you, i, and everyone else will not have a clue until after the offseason.  Arizona just lost the Super Bowl, looking at the trend in recent years, it appears the Cardinals will fail to reach the playoffs next year.  you just don't know.|`|pYq0LTbcaa	You're an idiot|`|XyME55xJaa	Wow, this is early....    you are kidding about the rams going undefeated, right?

thcr8Y5vaa	Kobe...|`|oGBEl25jaa	that overrated guy always says people are brainwashed by the media. and now all of you sound like you are.    if you watched the lakers games this season, you will come to find that kobe does indeed pass the ball.    when andrew was on a complete tear, did you see how his assists jumped up because he knew he would score. many times he finds players open looks they just miss them.    as for the stupid girl that said anyone can drop 61 with 45 shots he did take that many. he took only 31 shooting over 50 percent and making all of his free throws.    but here is one thing that kobe has over lebron.    almost every player says they play to get a ring on their finger.    kobe has 3, what does lebron have.    until the day he surpasses kobe in that, he was not more successful.    as for skill wise.     when you are 6 8 280 or whatever james is, you are supposed to get boards. those numbers are better then MJ's as well. but is he better.    no.    lebron hits an occasioanl jump shot and thats as far as that goes.    when he plays great centers he cant do anything in the paint.    take the lakers and magic game.    kobe can do it however he wants, whenever he wants.    kobe is better|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Kobe Is Better    Better Shooting/CLUTCH/Passing/Leading/More Experience    And Cares A little More About Defense    LeBron Has More Speed /Strength And Better Athleticism|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	kobe is better right now at 30 that lebron is at 24. lebron is not as good as being an on the ball defender yet, but with time he prob will be the best player in the nba if CP3 should fold. I mean 20pts with 10ast and almost 3 steals agame is better than most of anything else.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Kobi with an I is better than LeBron.    Had you used an E instead of an I, then LeBron would be better than Kobe.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	LeBron.|`|dqgAH3sEaa	Kobe just scored 60 pts last night.  Great for him.  Bad for his team.    Lebron averages more more blocks, assist, rebounds, points   and steals.  Lebron makes his teammates around him better.    He is truely a team player.  Kobe never has been...  Never will be.      There is no debate here.  Lebron is a better all around player.  Kobe  is a much better scorer.  But then again if you take 45 shots a night  you would have high averaged as well.  And yes Kobe does take more shots a night than Lebron...  (While averaging less points)|`|fqrE36YSaa	LeBron. Period.  He shares the ball with his team.  Kobe didn't. If he had then he would not have scored 60 points.  LeBron is a team player. Kobe is a man show that will have fits come Sunday when he tries to control the Cavaliers. The Cavs will remain perfect at home(if they beat Toronto tonight) because they will have played team basketball. Not one man ball.|`|vGRs2kApaa	actually greatness is best measured in scoring... because at the end of the day the team that scores the most is the one that wins... not the one that gets the most rebounds, steals, assists etc...     so  kobe bryant is better than lebron...|`|wXxJUnLJaa	LeBron>|`|xgGTyqHRaa	Kobe is better but Lebron is right on Kobes tail, because Kobe is getting old, and Lebron is still young. So yah, my answer is Kobe all the way, but lebron is really good to, Well anyway nice question, I look foward to answering another one of your questions! GOOD LUCK!|`|iTApg2h2aa	WELL IN MY OPINION I THINK LEBRON BECAUSE HE IS MORE OF A TEAM PLAYER THAN KOBE....KOBE SCORED 81 POINTS AND JUS LASTNITE HE SCORED 60 I DONT THINK A GOOD PLAYER SHOULD DO THIS HE SHOULD USE HIS TEAM.

KOBE JUS HAS POINTS...|`|AukGqk17aa	KOBE has better career all time    LEbron better this season    1000 i answered this Question    KOBE is better    "GO KOBE"|`|8c78Qlpxaa	compare a guard to a forward? i know the difference of SF to SG is not much but still a forward to a guard... just looking how Lebron's body is built makes him a better player just look at that guy a PF w/ a speed of an SG crazy...its not fair to compare them because they played diff position has totally different body makeup...|`|UTcTvHqIaa	What the hell is wrong with you guys.

zOw0Ta5Oaa	Cena ain't got nothing on The Rock I mean NOTHING, Rock better wrestler, actor, more popular with the fans as a heel or face, more recognized, his signatures moves are more popular, I mean these are new WWE fans that are saying these things about The Rock, these fans have to see The Attitude Era with The Rock, The Rock revolutionized the WWE next to Austin, without there rivalry WWE wouldn't be alive by now, Cena has to thank them not himself, The Rock has great moves, The Scorpion King, DOOM and more, The Rock was funnier than Cena. So who ever is saying this about The Rock is just another stupid Cena Fan.|`|k8YSuKGpaa	I don't know why they say that. I do agree with you that the Rock is a much better performer than cena. Like you said the only thing cena has going for himself is his dedication to the company, but the Rock was better overall.|`|AA11435718	well The Rock may be a better wrestler but both movies suck & what finisher are we talking about the rock bottom is better than the Dumb S.T.F.U  but the F.U  is a little better than the people elbow|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	Cause cena is the next big money maker for McMahon after the Rock. get the picture now?|`|yWhFoBBfaa	Why I agree with you there is no comparison as far as charisma goes(that is why the rock is making millions in movies instead of wrestling now), Cena is the best entertainer in the WWE today. Whether you like him or hate him he garners a lot of attention and his popularity is on a high enough level to be promoting a gillette product with the likes of Tiger Wood, Derek Jeter, Jimme Johnson. He is the most marketable person in the WWE today.|`|pLCOS0sUaa	I agree, comparing the two is unfair. Cena works harder than Rock ever did and is more dedicated to the business. All the Rock had was a few catchphrases, a lame finisher, and a stupid eyebrow. Cena is no technical genius in the ring, but he puts on a better match than Rock. As for the huge pops, have you listened when Cena hits the ring. Like him or not, Cena gets a reaction from the fans. I'm happy that Rock's movie career is going well. Maybe he'll do us the favor that Hogan couldn't do, and stay away from the ring.|`|bc5EELGhaa	it should be orton that should be compared to the rock.<br>  randy orton is the best wrestler wwe has ever signed|`|yvtGL6RTaa	people do that! jesus christ...cena is so gay...i hate him!...|`|GJsIZeUIaa	People compare them because they both have a gigantic fan base.
Av74719Qaa	Yes this is a double standard. Only because of the fact that these arguments are even being brought up.<br>  <br>  This is sports. We want the best players on the field/court playing the game. Who cares what color they are. Anyone that makes one of these statements, that more blacks or whitee are need in a sport is probably the one who is a racist. They don't see the players as great athletes, but rather as colors. These people have an agenda that has nothing to do with sports.|`|5MtNumoSaa	Whether or not this is a double standard really depends on the context in which these statements are made, not on just the statements themselves.<br>  Taken strictly on the basis of the 2 sentences you give, yes, it would appear to be a double standard. But if the idea behind statement #1 was that we need more white NBA players is that a larger percentage of the NBA should be white simply because there are more white people, then that could be construed as racist - you are then simply implying that the NBA "owes" it to white people to make sure they are represented. And if statement #2 is given the proper context, it is not racist at all. Usually when people question why there aren't more black baseball players, they are really questioning why the young black kids do not have the opportunities to play baseball. And the bottom line is that, because the black population in this country tends to be more highly concentrated in the more urban areas, where there are not as many baseball fields as there are in suburban or rural areas. (simply because there isn't room for them, not without losing prime real estate at least) if you look at it more as a statemnent like ," Baseball is such a great game for everyone, why aren't we doing all we can to expose ALL kids to it rather then just the ones who are fortunate enough to have room for a ballfield in their town ?", then it is not a racist comment at all. If anything, it is a comment intended to afford every child, regardless of the color of their skin, their economic condition, or their place of residence, a chance to enjoy the great game of baseball. And that could never truly be concerned as a racist comment in any way. And likewise, is someone were to say that baseball should in some way guarantee that the percentage of black ballplayers will reflect the overall black population, it would be a racist statement.<br>  <br>  On the surface, yes it is a double standard. But the 2 statements really have 2 totally different meanings, and 2 different intentions.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	I'll call it a double standard and raise you one. What about when someone says we need more black quarterbacks in the NFL, but nobody cares that almost every wide receiver is black?<br>  <br>  Or what about the NFL rule that says a team is required to interview at least one minority candidate before they hire a head coach? <br>  <br>  It is a double standard.|`|RJghPceKaa	first guys tole the answer from me<br>  <br>  im no racist, but it annoys me when im watching espn first take and they introduce a 10 minute conversation as a "real problem" that there are not enough blacks in the mlb. what about whites in the nba? i dont care about that but nobody else does either. so whyc are about blacks in the mlb? the answer is that the best mlb players and the best nba players get to the mlb and the nba. its not because blacks grow up in the inner city, like suggested in a tv show by nelly on espn. it is beacause they are either<br>  <br>  a. not good enough<br>  or<br>  b. dont want to|`|h074DM42aa	Look at demographics.  Racism is a card we throw out there when it is comfortable, that's all.<br>  <br>  Look at hockey--lots of equipment, requires ice.  Read that as: MONEY.<br>  <br>  Similar to baseball--lots of equipment, big grass field.  MONEY.<br>  <br>  Basketball--one ball and city provided hoops.  We can play one-on-one or five-on-five . . . or horse, or what have you.<br>  <br>  I am not saying its about race at all, but about demographics.  <br>  <br>  (At some point I would love for that term to be put to rest.)|`|dhs9QBMoaa	The point is that we don't "need" more players of any ethnic background in any sport.  We should only be interested in the best players available - regardless of their backgrounds.  As soon as you "need" a certain ethnic look, you're falling into racial discrimination.|`|AA11620976	I'll raise you one standard <br>  How about that argument(?) presented by Black guys that claim that Ruth's numbers are invalid b/c he never played against genetically superior Black & Hispanic athletes|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	We need fewer gangsters in the NBA.

MMI8S60Vaa	For a shirt, wear a sweater or long underwear top to keep you warm and also the coat, but hoodies are way too bulky for skiing. Light fleeces are also good. If the coat's really warm, you probably would just be able to wear a long sleeved shirt underneath wjithout gettin cold.<br>  Under ur snowpants, leggings are fine if the snowpants are insulated and really warm. If theyre too short it should be fine as longas they reach your skiboots. Sweatpants are good if you dont wear the leggings underneath. <br>  For socks, you should wear anything wool or good synthetic fabric. NO cotton socks, they just make your feet colder even if your wearing several layers of them. And if your socks are too thick and cut off circulation your feet get cold. You can also get little temporary heat packs for your feet and theyre really cheap, so you should be able to get them. Then u don need to wear as many socks. <br>  Also, try to cover as much skin as possible by wearing a helmet, goggles, mittens with temporary heat packs in them, and a scarf over your face because your face can get really warm when skiing. Hope it helps and have a fun time ^w^|`|nCgRxGNeaa	i think instead of wearing 4 pairs of socks, you should wear kenn high socks (my friends wore ankel socks and got massive scars and scabs)<br>  <br>  To ski: go on the bunny hills and remember pizza and french fries. (pizza-tilt your skis into a V to look like a piece of pizza to STOP)<br>  (French fried- skis are straight  which lets you go down the hill)<br>  (TO TURN- put pressure on one leg and you should go the other was, opposite way that your leg has pressure on)<br>  <br>  also, watch videos on youtube for more advice<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|SL98InTfaa	I bought some $8 long underwear from Target. Great stuff. I know you can't buy any, but next time its good to invest in some.<br>  <br>  Check the Mountain weather. I just got back from a skiing trip and if I wore what you are I would have melted to death.<br>  <br>  I wear long underwear, fleece sweatpants, a hoodie, my coat and snowpants. And one pair of fuzzy socks will usually get the job done. No fuzzy socks? Two pairs of regular ones work too. The ski boots go up high, so you don't need knee highs. I wore ankle socks.<br>  <br>  Have some fun out there!|`|PmjeWyn2aa	You shouldn't need that many layers. You will probably be sweating in all that gear, which is not something you want to do in the cold. When I ski I wear, long johns (pants and shirt) two pairs of socks, sweatshirt, and jacket. also snow pants.<br>  Start out on the 'bunny hill", practice turning by leaning ur body and cutting ur skis in the snow to turn. U will not turn by simply turning ur skis. U need to bend ur knees and lean into ur turns by cutting the edge of ur skis into the snow.|`|BwEcixxeaa	The best way to enjoy your first time skiing is to take a lesson.  Many places have package deals for beginners.  Skiing is much more fun when you know what you are doing. Lessons are worth the expense... and as an added bonus you get to cut the lift line.|`|x2bTvscWaa	hey, i've gone skiiing for a couple of years and i know exactly what to wear. Ok, what u should wear is either sweatpants (if sweatpants if u want long underwear...sounds weird but it so helps!) or jeans under a good pair of snowpants. For a shirt, what i wear is a long sleeved shirt that is made to keep body heat in and then on top for a little bit of style i put an awesome short sleeved shirt on top. I have seen a few people put light fleeces or sweat shirts (REALLY thin) under their thick jackets, but for me it doesn't work cause i feel too bulky. Either way is good i guess. NOW!!!, u want to put skii socks on. they are made sepeccially to lock the heat in a nd wick away sweat....at least that is what my dad told me... and they are way better. If u can't go out and buy any, borow some from a friend or family member, OR u can put on long socks, knee socks i think u said u have, but then put on slightly bulkier but shorter socks on. Putting too many socks on isn't comfortable and then ur skii or snowboarding boots will be too loose (u need them tight). NEXT, u must have good gloves, mittens are better then mittens and if u want some people but hotties in them to keep ur hands warmer. Lastly, around the face, definatly wear a helmet, and some ppl don't put hats under them unless it is really really cold. DEFINATLY wear a neck warmer, it helps so so so much, and gogles are your best friend! they deflect the light from the snow and help u see where u r going. OK ALL SET!!! HAVE FUN!!!!|`|isA4wtnMaa	You have too many layers and too many socks.  I only wear one and maybe some toe warmers ($2-3) if it's cold.  However, mine are actual ski socks.  If yours aren't I would suggest just wearing two and avoiding cotton where possible.|`|fJbWRwsmaa	Pants are fine, lose the hoodie, and 3 of the pairs of socks. Just make sure you wear a thermal pair, and use some toe warmers if ur feet get cold.

When you watch TNA, all you get is the Main Event Mafia destroying the Fronline, week after week after week, and WWE has better wrestlers like HHH, Randy Orton, Taker, and Y2J, all TNA has is mid-card trash that the WWE didn't want like Scott Steiner, Sting, etc.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	Its hard to say, because i watch both every week. I say that TNA has better talent but wwe has somewhat a better storyline and Tna does about the same thing every week.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	TNA, why? I don't care about acting in fact I think what's hurting TNA most is probably the amount of promo's. They don't need promo's to be better than WWE they were already back in the day when they focused on the wrestling. That's what should matter to the WRESTLING fans, not how good the wrestler can act this ain't the Oscars.     And when it comes down to it whether you like it or not TNA gives much better wrestling especially at the PPV's Shelley vs Sabin @ Genesis is one fine example.     TNA  is better than WWE, because it has better wrestling macthes, but don't feel you have to  abandon it altogether you can wacth both if you want.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	WWE|`|JRGttmejaa	wwe becuse they dont compy     tna copys matches like wwe money in the bank    this is tna match fest or fierd    and a long time ago the had a 2 out of 3 falls match first fall pins    2ed fall submissos only and the 3erd fall lader match and it was kurt vs aj styes|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	TNA, reason being they have Christopher Daniels.

5VxgTspWaa	Start running 1-2 miles a day,try to do workouts in the gym that will help you increase your speed, also practice shooting,passing and dribbling with your friends to get your ball touches better, drink plenty of water and watch what you eat. hope this helps|`|GswzU4SWaa	(tried to do some research on the hockey question)    im a little bit short. 5'7 and im usually a forward because of my speed on the through ball. so this is what i do.    lets see... you are going to want to build your stamina the best you can. while doing this you will also make your legs stronger.  lots of kardio. trust me. when it comes to speed. speed is nothing unless you have gas in the tank. (even though im still the fastest on my team and i dont come across any fast D-men.)    before you run or do anything like that. drink water maybe an hour before you go out. so you are hydrated while you workout. you need something to sweat out in the beginning to keep you cool.    when you practice shooting. or accuracy try to shoot as hard as you can. like its a real in-game shot. so you know how to really shoot with accuracy. dont place a ball down and try to hit a spot with a soft shot. you wont do that in a game. and if you do. the goalie will get it easily.    last but not least. when i am not on the field training, i always have my soccer ball with me. dribbling it around while i walk around the house while not looking down. help build a presence of where the ball is and will help with ball control. i also like to try little tricks while im walking down a hall way with it.    but anyways. that is what I do. just giving you some advice.|`|f9dRts2zaa	I ran 4 miles every day in the summer before my fall season.

1uLfl0sXaa	I don't think the little master is scared of anything or anybody: if he's really scared about something he'd have kept quiet. The whole world knows conditions in NZ at this time is not good for cricket, but with the busy schedule they couldn't find a better time.<br>  Nobody will blame anybody if something goes wring, but the chances for that is less. if they prepare fast pitches Zaheer & Co will be licking their fingers, if slow, no problems, if flat pitches as Wright has recommended, no problem.

m332U6Wfaa	Bench order is the amount of time the bench players get to play and how you substitute them in and out of the games, this shouldnt be a big concern.

TEX1iYQgaa	Corners won't be your only challenge on riding a fixie.<br>  <br>  I don't ride one myself, but my friends who do say the initial challenge they had was to overcome their instinct to stop pedaling. They say it just about throws you over the handlebars.<br>  <br>  Even if you're not on a fixie, you should work on not allowing your pedals to hit the ground while cornering. It could jar your bike out of its lean and it could cause you to crash ~ not to mention the accumulative damage occurring to your pedals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aQcsrgLCaa	All the above is correct, but you can help yourself a bit by selecting a frame with a higher bottom bracket to allow a bit more clearance whilst cornering.<br>  <br>  A slower cornering speed (I've never found this a problem in any way) is a small thing to put up with when put against all the positive advantages of riding fixed.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	To help with this problem when cornering you can lean yourself more than the bike, as this will keep the bike more upright and lessen the pedal grinding. If you are really into carving corners you will find that you will have to go a little slower as you also won't be able to load the out side pedal.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Two things to think about. First cornering technique, you need to learn to lean your body more than the bike to keep the bike more upright. Second, equipment. Some pedals offer a bit more clearance than others. Sppedplay pedals are a good example of this, your shoe will touch the ground before the pedal does. A high bottom bracket will give you more clearance for cornering. Crank length is another factor, many fixed gear bikes are equipped with cranks under 170 mm in length, 165 mm being a common size for fixed gear bikes. Put all these things together and you will be able to corner with abandon.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Clipless pedals will give you extra room or you can learn to lean your body over the side more.  You wont be going as fast on a fixed gear bike.

Your going to have to go back to school later on and it will put you behind in a lot of things. If you really feel you can go pro, then yea go for it, but that'll be really hard.<br>  <br>  And are you ranked number 1 in your region and stuff? Because you need to be that high to basically go pro. And how will your parents deal with this? Are they just going to let you leave school and focus on tennis?<br>  <br>  I'd try to do both at this stage of your life, like just finish high school, and if you really have a career in tennis then do it after high school.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	You are almost done with high school, so I would do my best to finish it.  Loads of potential means nothing in the bank.  Playing since you were 8 also means nothing.  What is your junior ranking, and what tennis academy have you joined?  I know school can be tough, but hang in there.  Not very many people make oodles of money playing tennis, and the odds of you doing it, are slim to none.  Unless your coach is a world class tennis coach, that is.
AS5bLez1aa	35-40 degrees sounds pretty cold if you are fishing for bass.I suppose you are fishing for smallmouth?Or largemouth?Are you fishing out of a boat or off a dock or land there are a lot of variables when fishing right after winter melt off.If I were fishing out of a boat for bass I would use my electronics and start out vertical jigging a one ounce spoon over schooling shad, a jerk bait might work if you can get it down deep enough.Sometimes  weighting the jerk bait with suspend- a -dots works to get the bait down.If I were fishing from the land try SLOW cranking a crawdad color wiggle wart.If you fishing from a dock try to locate brush piles  and fish for crappie with jigs tipped with minnows you might have better luck.Have fun!|`|BK1GjPT6aa	If anything, you'll gain experience if not a meal.~good luck catchin.'|`|9qjuY5l6aa	Fish rarely bites in windy weather.|`|XKdUGiwFaa	If you were guaranteed to catch a fish every time out they would call it catching rather than fishing.  The wind will bother you more than it will bother the fish.  Give it a try and dress warm, the wind will bother you less if you have something to cover your ears and head.  Get out there and give it a try, if it's too miserable go home.  If you catch a fish then great.  If you don't then hopefully you had fun trying.  Good luck.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Well, miscellaneous soft-plastics are about the only chance of catching a fish you will get. Frogs, salamanders, worms or crayfish, try them all.

NG6eeCfuaa	Boxers distance run to build stamina. Boxers don't sprint. A boxer needs to log many miles to build stamina. A boxer doesn't wake up at 4am and run a mile, they run six. Builds wind.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	But you're probably going tp be moving a lot and running will help you build endurance.   It will also strengthen your legs.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to find a fighter who didn't do a lot on running, usually several miles a day.|`|ZU5fduvpaa	when you are training for boxing the whole purpose of running is to build speed and stamina for example if you watch boxers they have very fast footwork they earn this through running and skipping whilst there ability to punch fast comes from a speedball but the main idea for running in bxing training is incase the 2 boxers get to the final round (round 15) which is a ver long time and to get there you must have allot of stamina and running builds stamina|`|sOi98doYaa	In a nutshell, boxers run to build up stamina. As the rounds progress, the body begins to tire - the same symptoms as running yourself into the ground.<br>  <br>   A clever boxer will endure his jogging program, increasing the distance and speed as his fight date becomes nearer.<br>  <br>   Its bad enough trying to outwit your opponent, besides having to contemplate running out of gas as well.<br>  <br>   You watch the heavyweights in the later rounds, they are holding onto one another for dear life.|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	If a boxer does not jog he will not last the distance.<br>  <br>  Heavyweight boxers look like they do not run much which is why they tend to hold and tire quickly unlike the smaller fighters can usually fight till the end no problem.<br>  <br>  It called stamina baby!|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	*laughs*  You must have never once boxed.

Choosing the right bike is like buying a car. Theres the people who just want a fast hotshit car and there's people who just want practicality. Then there's the "hotrodders" like me who like to build up our own custom rigs right off the bat. <br>  <br>  your first BMX should be all about fit. Just getting the right size frame and choosing the size handlebars you like best, etc. I know most people are going to say "get the lightest most expensive bike" but just getting the right size, right strength, right priced bike is key for a first bike. As you progress and make some money, you wioll most likely start modding your bike with cooler, lighter, stronger parts... then you can take these parts and switch them over to a new frame if you desire one. <br>  <br>  So my advice is to just pick out a few complete bikes that are in your price and size range (danscomp.com is great for this) and then come back to Yahoo Answers and put up a new post listing the options you narrowed it down to. :D I hope this helped buddy!  (BTW, the danscomp chart is just a recommendation for beginners... for example, it might recommend you ride with 8x28" handlebars... a LOT of guys like to ride with short bars... and a lot of them cut them down even smaller! So my advice would be to go with the chart and mod your bike out as you go along)|`|qOqUHYakaa	YOU SHOULD GET LIKE A 21'' OR SOMTHING HIGHER THAN 20.75''<br>  LOOK FOR WEIGHT, LOOK FOR WHAT PPL RECOMEND THE MOST AND THAT HAVE GREAT REVIEWS ON IT.
2SSD6BP9aa	I think jockstraps are more comfortable than compression shorts.  I don't usually wear it over any kind of underwear, but you can do that if you have a problem with changing in front of other guys.<br>  <br>  But whichever way you go, make sure to get the jockstrap with the cup or the compression shorts that have the special pocket for the cup.  You don't want to wear the cup against your skin.  It's not designed to be worn that way.<br>  <br>  First of all you would have sweat collect between your junk and the plastic cup.  That's a sure way to get jock itch (think athlete's foot on your sack).  Second is that you don't want your junk sitting up against the cup if you catch a hit there, or the shock will carry right through.  Ever see those things where they have the metal balls in a line hanging from strings, and when you pull one back and it swings down to hit the rest of the balls it knocks the one on the far end out?  It's like that only YOUR balls are on the other end.<br>  <br>  That's why cup jocks and the special compression shorts have that pocket for the cup to go into.  It keeps cloth between your skin and the cup to wick sweat away, and it works to hold your package back from the cup so there's a cushion of space between them.<br>  <br>  And it's not good enough to just slide the cup between two layers of underwear.  That won't secure it and it will slide around on you.  Then if you get hit, it may pinch one of your nuts.  You don't want that.  The cup jock or the special compression shorts will hold that cup in place for you.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	I do that too. I wear a jock strap on top of my briefs. It's comfortable, but you can wear it with a long "banana" cup and it provides good protection and coverage. Also don't have to mess with taking the cup in and out. It stays in the jock strap, and you just slip it on easily.|`|yAvh8wjFaa	Get the shorts that have the place to slide the cup in or "cup pocket" I have found they are much better than jock straps.  That way you can go to school all day and then before you train just slide in the cup and the jewels are protected.|`|mOwznDfaaa	If you don't like a jock w/ a cup then go with the compression shorts although I can't stand them because they bunch and feel confining.  Whatever you choose you have to find something that will keep the cup from moving around.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Any of those ideas sound good. Why can't you bring a change of clothes with you and change into them at the gym?|`|e86f624ac7abafd2725c361b122b48f9aa	I wear a jockstrap on top of my boxer-briefs, it works.|`|REoU6f2taa	compression shorts are the way to go because they tend to be a little more comfy.

aX8nee8gaa	Not only can you pivot, the answer is you absolutely must! Watch the Tour players even on chip shots and short pitches and you will still see some body rotation. To answer which goes first, try the following..<br>  <br>  Hit pitch shots just with your hands, no body at all. What happens? You chunk and skull these shots, your distance control is awful, and you cannot control the spin at all<br>  <br>  Now do the same but merely hold onto the club with your hands and arms and use only body rotation to swing the club. And I mean rotate both ways-back and forth. Most amateurs stop their bodies on the way down and flip the hands. You must pivot back and through.  Now what happens? Distance control becomes much easier, contact becomes cleaner and spin and roll become easy to predict based on the club and amount of swing. Also notice that your hands have stayed ahead of the ball by using your body instead of your hands.<br>  <br>  Actually go try this, I think you will be amazed at how much easier it becomes|`|W2R8TRDmaa	A pitch shot is just a mini golf swing.  So yes, the feet, legs, hips, shoulders, etc work just like the full swing just to a smaller degree.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	yes, just like a normal swing, just a little easier. <br>  <br>    when people chip and dont rotate around "feet stay put"  thats about 20 yards and in for me.|`|sBrummATaa	if you do, which i don't, but i would say let your hands go through first, then pivot. make sure your hands are in front of the ball as well when you make contact with the ball.|`|wYGeg0QRaa	50-40-30- yard pitch shots are feel shots and you must be tuned into what your body wants to do to hit the ball each of those distances. If you feel like you have to turn through with the shot do so. Do not in any way restrict your swing motion as it will only lead to confusion and inconsistent results. Feel the swing as you perform your motion and you'll become consistent with your results. Let your hands lead your body through the motion and your body will smoothly follow the lead.
LIKkt8djaa	Well since they're lamar bindings I'm not surprised they came without plates, As for them being universal and can fit any pair of bindings... no, Go to sportsmart or something to get actual lamar replacement plates cause no true snowboard shop carries those bindings.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	If your bought them from a store bring them back and get ones with the base plate. As far as I can tell from what I have seen on them. A lot of base plates are the same but I don't know about the Lamar type bindings. You could also try going to your local shop or a pro shop and see if they have either spares (maybe someone broke a binding).
MUERDKyzaa	I prefer to watch Serie A because in the Premier League the second half of the table teams just put 10 men behind the ball, defend and play anti-football. It's so boring in England and alot of mindless shots from 40 yards and rubbish long balls. <br>  <br>  There's hardly any technique or thinking involved and half the defenders are retarded in our premier league. <br>  <br>  Serie A is much more technical and you see wonderful football who ever is playing even though most people on here probably haven't watched much Serie a, they dismiss it saying that its 'boring and slow' La liga is pretty cool to watch aswell. The games in Spain are a lot more open than in England and their attacking style is great.<br>  <br>  Yh Inter's a great side and can beat Man u easily on their day.<br>  But i'm Milan faaaan when I watch Serie A,,, Forza Maldiniiiiii!!!!!!!|`|GsV67vUNaa	It's a brilliant league.

91be33a93393b2cfe2ea14aae38ab03daa	First of all, nobody is too old to skate. There are adult skaters, you know. Second of all, you don't need to compete ito enjoy the sport. In my opinion, competing can often take away from yor love of the sport.<br>  <br>  You might think that all great figure skaters begin when they are very young (and it's true), but are you aware that the great Johnny Weir started when he was about 12 years old? You can do very well in competitive figure skating if you have some of the following: raw talent, ability to take directions and learn quickly, an experienced and qualified coach, and prior training in areas such as gymnastics and/or ballet.<br>  Also, from your description, being able to skate backwards only, I'd say  better bet for you is to look into competing at ISI (Ice Skating Institute) competitions rather than USFS (US Figure Skating) competitions. ISI is a bit more low-key, but it is more well-rounded. There are many more events and it focuses a little less on competing and more on performing. It's fun to aprticipate in so many events, and since the groups aren't 20+ kids like USFS, you are more likely to medal. A lot of skaters tend to stereotype ISI as the association you only do when you're younger, but I am witnessing that stereotype fall right now.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you have any other questions about skating. I'm always here to help.|`|FtVfuByHaa	No youre absolutely not too old for starting figure skating at the age of 14. im almost 16 and just started figure skating and i think i have been progressing quite well in a couple of months. just practice hard and you will see that it is not too late. especially if you have earlier for example had aerobic sports, gymnastics or dance (eg ballet etc.) as hobbies before, you will realize they have a huge impact on your skating. When your motivation is high, you will also see the results faster :)|`|8ZZV6Mmaaa	yes if you're trying to get to the olympics. my friend is only 16 and she is going through a really rough time because she was injured and had to sit out for a year (when she was 14-15) and that caused a lot of problems. now she cant really go anywhere or do anything except for training and getting healed up. i guess for any sport you have to be really dedicated, and since your already grown you probably have to be homeschooled and spend a lot of money to get ready for competitions.<br>  <br>  imo not worth it as a career. you must be passionate for the sport, not the money or fame or else you end up just giving up.|`|Z0c1zw4Kaa	Competing, yes. <br>  I'm 14 now, and I started skaiting when I was 7 years old.<br>  Maybe just for fun, but if you thought you would catch up, you could try..<br>  I would advice you to do it just for fun, your not ready for the hard work.|`|zwvDITr5aa	You might fall down and can't get up.

Loads of people take up skating as an adult and go on to compete for fun.<br>  <br>  Edit: You're 14? I started when I was 30. I compete several times a year, including a couple of competitions which are "all age" so I'm generally against 7 and 8 year olds. (They generally beat me :) )|`|Tt61Vp92aa	how old are you?
WrDGhduxaa	civilization has removed many natural predators so some animals have prospered beyond the ability of the environment to support them.<br>  There are more deer in North America today than when Columbus landed, without hunting to control their population they would diminish in size and destroy crops and vegetation.<br>  Ducks were at one time almost extinct, Ducks Unlimited has developed areas where the ducks can stop and feed in their annual migrations. <br>  It is true that this group wants ducks to hunt, but if not for them there would be fewer and maybe no wild ducks. <br>  Hunters fund all wildlife management programs, not people who claim to care for animals and want to stop all hunting.|`|AA11658197	A high population of vegetarian animals (deer, elk) can overgraze on the land causing water control problems.<br>  A high population of wolves can cause population drop of deer, beaver and soon become danger to humans.<br>  Whichever species seems to be gaining an unfair advantage is prime to become game.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	has two sides//kaibab penuslia  one,,took out cats over populated deer died off,,//texas now big horn//pen raise //  turn out eat by cats,,, 1990 thru 2009 richland chambers,,type two swamp,,90 lots small deer  goes public 500 shooters,,cull  for 8 years//  goes draw only 98//10 shooters//  eight  groups//size an weight up ///200+ taken an confiscated last year// manage to mess up as much as get right|`|AA11306089	Population Control.

UucDW5cpaa	Well i am only 13 and i love rugby and i try my best to keep fit for rugby too like yourself. I mainly go out running for about 3 mile when i get time. This help you get faster and if you do some of the 3 mile up hill that is really good because this improves your stamina and that is vital in rugby. If you do this running for about a month you will notice that your recovery time will improve. Good luck.|`|VM300US7aa	as long as you get proper nutrition benching is fine.  run some pyramids on the track to build stamina.|`|zlnC1wECaa	well the doc said that i am hyper mobile which means im bendy, he also said this makes me more susceptible to injury. but i think this helps me because i tackle quite alot and am at the bottom of pile ups and my body is pushed into awkward positions. a way to make yourself more flexible is when your heart rate is high then just stretch off all of your ligiments. this isnt a strength aspect just a way to prevent injury.|`|fKco44yxaa	Press ups and **** like that

jjdEG6cFaa	Shaving in swimming is mostly about the feel. Since a significant part of performance is mental, if a swimmer feels better in the water, they'll think that they can go faster, and will go faster. Shaving versus not shaving is a very big difference and feel for the water, because a lot of skin is removed when you shave.<br>  <br>  If the swimmer shaved for every practice, they would get used to the difference in feel that shaving provides, and it wouldn't provide any benefit (other than the hydrodynamic benefit, which is probably very small with the new full body suits) at all. The less often someone shaves, the bigger difference it will make, which is why most swimmers shave once or twice a year.|`|DVXypPKgaa	hair=drag <br>  no hair=faster times|`|zmhQdYbDaa	Hair creates drag and, if this is his first time shaving, then his skin is dry on the surface. The second he shaves it there is less drag and also he will have a better feel for the water. If he shaves it all the time, soon enough there won't be a difference between his meets. Shaving is something you do especially for meets, since at practice a little bit more drag won't affect him negatively but at a meet it will.|`|FSSU21cyaa	the hair creates resistance in the water and, believe it or not, can be the difference between a win and a loss. if you practice with hairy legs, it makes it that much harder to swim, and then if you shave it off right before a meet, you can swim that much faster. Plus it gives you an ego boost|`|BwJOeHDEaa	bc people are retarded, the people that I know that shaved, kept the hair until the race, so they had DRAG when they practiced..unless your in the olypics or a college level, shaving doesnt help that much, if he was that die hard about it, tell him to swim while wearing jeans..|`|3Xvs3t8Faa	most of the officials at swim meets are gay so if they wait til the very most last meet than they officials "feel them up" and they might be able to get exta points for their team. <br>  Also most boys that swim are gay so it doesnt bother them|`|SWNhIlPfaa	because the hair on your legs makes drag so when you shave it off before the last meet you can go faster with no hair|`|cj7NTUGVaa	Less hair = Faster Times.<br>  <br>  If he shaves it all the time he'll just be the same.

As Murphy said, the ABs don't get anyone to carry their bags for them and as a group they are far more important than cricketers.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	They are just cricketers, not royalty, hell, the All Blacks carry their own baggage for jimminys sakes.|`|oNSiaGooaa	there are better and important things than cricket, specially in this economy and world situation ....grow up|`|91y0pMzeaa	nz whats ur say|`|MgyCw2Hjaa	I have always been a fan of the Indian cricket team, but over the last few years the most immature comments from legions of fans are really turning me.<br>  <br>  In the past I understand why everyone liked Aus to lose, we were arrogant at times and we expected to win.<br>  <br>  The tables are turning, and so are fans around the world as India is becoming the team to hate, but not because of the players behaviors, but the fan's.<br>  <br>  <br>  What sort of premadonnas can't carry their own luggage?<br>  <br>  <br>  Now I want the Kiwis to fight and fight hard.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think a humbling is on the horizon!|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	Firstly if your cricketers are so rich y dont they have their own luggage carriers??<br>  Secondly why would NZ give a flying **** about your cricket team u are as far away from god as u can possibily get so y wud we treat u like 1??<br>  Thirdly, You need to learn how to use soap coz aint nobody want to touch ur curry stained stink Baggage now howz that for hospitality!!<br>  Your here to get ur asses kicked and then go home ur not special never have been never will be.|`|NKN7SeDtaa	its for security reasons.. in new zealand (the country) no one cares about those indian players ..

5W9KNNk4aa	kazmir and greinke, slam dunks.<br>  <br>  Greinke is the best choice - he has decent strikeout and win potential, and will not cost you nearly anything since he is drafted in the 20th round.  He will go in the low teens in a scratch draft, so you are getting a handful of rounds of value.<br>  <br>  Kazmir is the best pitcher of the bunch.  He has the potential to lead the league in K's.  He also pitches on a stong team, and keeps a low era and whip.<br>  <br>  Burnett is the worst choice out of this bunch.  He is injury prone, and he is not consistent for era and whip.  Even if you don't keep him, you would be able to pick him in the 11th round, or even later.  There are way better choices in your bunch.|`|x5AUFn07aa	Seriously by far Zack Greinke even though he's on a bad team he's got good stuff. A.J.

Still, contact the league near you, and tell them about your interest. You can probably find a speed skating team at 16 however. It will get you going in the right direction.|`|1b6061c7358fa5cff298a9a77f4f3306aa	Check with your local league and see if the have a juniors division. There are not many of them out there but they do exist. Another thing you can do to be involved is volunteer. You may not be old enough to participate yet but by volunteering you can learn a lot about the game and your local league.

The US isn't the only place with great events going on.|`|2fJLXXmqaa	Well Sergio has played on the european tour this year, but not in America yet probably because he is originally from Spain and wants to spend some time in Europe. He should be playing in the match play because he is second in the world. the match play is the top 36 or 34 I think|`|aX8nee8gaa	He has played (in Europe), just not worth a crap.

Y3KMLdjWaa	First, unless your parts are worn out this is just money wasted for very little gain if any at all. <br>  If your parts are worn out, damaged or if you just want to spend some money then it depends on what level of components you want to buy. (to do this with low end parts the cost will start at about $125) <br>  If you currently have a bike with a rear wheel that uses a SRAM or Shimano 8 speed cassette then you do not need a new rear wheel or hub.<br>  Going from 8 to 9 requires<br>   1) 9 speed cassette<br>   2) 9 speed chain<br>   3) 9 speed shifter that is compatible with the derailleur. <br>  <br>  To do it yourself, you will need a few special tools, here's some help:<br>  <a href="http://www.parktool.com/repair/readhowto.asp?id=48" rel="nofollow">http://www.parktool.com/repair/readhowto...</a>|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	well you will need new shifters for one, probably need new rear derailleur and front if getting shifters as a pair, you need a new cassette and you may need a new rear wheel to accomodate a 9 speed cassette but most likely your old 8 speed wheel will work...<br>  Total cost on all of this really depends on what brand you go with and what level. For Deore, $150 for XTR $1000 for Sram X5, $200 for X0 $1000+|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You will need a new shifter, cassette, chain.  It's really not worth the extra cost and there is no real benefit.|`|VT1BSwFcaa	Could be quite a lot!<br>  you will need to buy a 9 speed cassette and probably a new rear wheel that will take it. Then a new set of gear shifters and maybe a new rear derailleur to take the slightly wider cassette.|`|v9U6AwyBaa	You would probably be better looking for a new bike with 9 speed already fitted.
R5G9h2ygaa	The time to release one for this year has well and truely passed with the super 14 and six nations having already started. The good news though is that there has been alot of people asking about the game which probably means that rugby 2010 will be made next year and 2011 will be a certainty for the world cup year|`|PJsSpbcwaa	i feel the same way mate they need to make one for the next generation consoles at least|`|lPrfbb1Maa	I was thinking the same thing.... soon hopefully|`|ETarSy9Maa	I have been trying to find out, I'm not 100%, but it's starting to sound like there is not enough interest, like there is for Madden and Basketball, so they might have terminated it.  They'd be crazy not to make one in 2011.|`|M253zMU4aa	Im guessing that the new one will probably come out this year because EA released one in 2005,2006 and 2007.

Of course, if I watch a Cena match with no sound, I could still see the STF and refer to it as the STF-U myself, but that's not quite the same as listening to Jerry "The King" Lawler say "STF-U".    Commentary aside, I like both moves equally.|`|lr68XuMFaa	The STF, even though Cena is gay, Regal just sucks, he can't wrestle
xfD4z4pmaa	I think this year with all the injuries, they have been underrated. They have figured out ways to win without Boozer and Andre. However, even with those two healthy, they can't seem to find a way to win on the road. <br>  <br>  They will never win a championship if they can't figure out how to win on the road. They have a very strong team that hustles and plays hard defense. Their bench is good as well. A lot of people were hoping they would do a trade. No need to, once they get Boozer back, they will be full force. Something they have never been all season. Deron was out, he came back, then Boozer went out. Deron is at full strength and AK will be shortly. Give the Jazz a few weeks to get Boozer back and they will go on a huge run.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Yes, they've beaten the Lakers and Celtics but I still don't think they are legit contenders for the championship this year.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	No Ma'am<br>  <br>  I do not agree|`|2VVgxFDKaa	there not underrated, a lot of people thought they would be 2nd place behind the Lakers this year.  A lot of NBa analysts like Utahand still like Utah.  They have just battled injuries the whole year and there finally getting healthy but Boozer is still out|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	They've been underrated since they have lost Carlos Boozer to injury.|`|KYBuotxPaa	Utah is underrated for a reason.|`|GKH8n3xzaa	I agree<br>  The Utah Jazz are underrated...they beat the Lakers, Celtics, Dallas...need i go on!!|`|AA10863855	They are a good team and will be better when they get healthy.  Finals bound?  Sorry not this year.  Yes they beat LA and Boston, but both were close games and in Utah.  Their biggest problem is that they are a poor road team.  Inevitably, they must get through SA or LA.  They probably won't get through 4 games in either city.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	Hard to see them under rated when Boozer is out. They had to adjust and remained over 500 doing so, and others stepped up. You lose your main guy who posts double doubles, guys need to step it up as Utah has and has maintained their playoff positioning. The win over Boston shows they are serious. However, they cant afford more injuries to go deep.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I agree they are one of the most underrated teams in the NBA. They also make a sow for the Jazz fan's when Deron Williams has the ball. They also have like 39% chance to make the NBA Finals this year so they are a huge contender.|`|I3N22I2Oaa	100% agreed. everyone has forgotten boozer is out.<br>  <br>  they are second best team in west. beat celtics, lakers, and hornets.<br>  <br>  they will lose only in playoffs to lakers in seven. will win all playoff series before they lose to lakers.|`|aupDanleaa	disagreed nuggets more underated|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	Naahhh, but I was impressed last night!  They'l make it to perhaps the 2nd round though!|`|5Fq178afaa	they are underrated what i saw yesterday was a very physical team and derron williams is one of the best players in the league even though jerry doesn't like ak47 he is still a great player boozer will be back i like milsap okaor stretches out the defense brewer and miles get to the basket. the could contend with some teams but i dont know if they could beat the lakers cavs celtics or spurs in a 7 game series
HiuNSScLaa	PERFECT he would be perfect for the heat coming off the the bench yo play pg just like our other white chocolate (chris quinn) then chris wont be the only white boy jk that was all a joke except it being good the only thing that sucked about williams is he shot SUPER LONG 3S that he didnt need to and air balled them but i dont think he should start over chalmers chalmers is great very underrated should be in the running for roy and will be one of the best point gaurds in the nba backup for miami he would shine/it would be great for the heat cause you also get veteran leadership|`|hLSIRDtZaa	He's Doody! Kirk Hinrich is better than him among white point guards. If he gets to the level of the best white point guards of all time, then we can get excited. Pete Mavarich, Jerry West, and Bob Cousy. If he ain't close to those white point guards, then don't even waste your breath with him in conversation. LOL I'm just being honest. Oh, and I forgot John Stockton even though about 80% of his passes went to one person...Karl Malone. I don't see how that would make John Stockton a great point guard. Pffft! LOL I'd be a great point guard to if someone that could score easy 25 a night was my receiving player from my passes. So John Stockton, question marks on him.|`|oAsmgOCeaa	He's always been a decent player and is still young so I'm sure he'd make a very good back-up for somebody.  Nothing to get too excited about but he can help a team win.|`|dDhTMacAaa	He should never have retired.<br>  <br>  He is a wild guy, so while there are logical options for him, who knows where he will go.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I hope dosen't go back to the Heat so then Mario won't be a starter he has been amazing this year with points assists and steals. Jason Williams is also a good point guard, but not as good as Mario has been.I don't care if he return's to the NBA but I just don't want him to go to the Heat.|`|sbAXlECuaa	Jason Williams is a very good basketball player with a shi77y attitude.

nKSmgjylaa	In my opinion, yes. They currently have many former OVW wrestlers with them, and the majority of them are very talented. OVW is a great company that's turned out some great wrestlers. On the other hand though, FCW is becoming better kown by the day, and it's turned out a lot of good wrestlers as well. I think we should just wait and see what happens in the next few months as far as new talents go.  x|`|Q1MI6L96aa	It was a puzzling move, since there are so many former WWE employees with OVW. The business model of FCW is solid, though, and is like the successful (NWA) territories from years ago. But I would think the emerging talent with OVW would still have an inside track to the company.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	I would say yes why start a new place if they are understaff from the start!|`|4tvI9WYjaa	yes better talent comes from ovw|`|zb40cLwOaa	Nah they took all the people they cared about to FCW with them so it worked out.|`|dGYR81enaa	Definitely thats were large careers began e.g. Batista, pheonix and santino

LKVTY2EPaa	yeah i agree with you. those were some big wins and beating Venus would be major (but I doubt that she will). But i think she'll lose the giant killer title to Carla Suarez Navarro. I am expecting her to have a great clay court season.|`|EzSMKnG9aa	well, i just love her style of game and she doesn't hesitate in her shots, so that makes her game better. She's got the best down-the-line shots (forehand or backhand) i've seen in a while.<br>  I think that she should improve her serve a bit more and she'll be an even better player than she is right now. and yes, i believe that she can beat top players and just like you said she's proved it in this tournament, beating Safina, Hantuchova and Zvonareva so far.<br>  she has beaten Venus in their last meeting in Tokyo, also.|`|1w5blbobaa	Well First & foremost I don't think She will able 2 beat Venus anyhow.<br>  <br>  There is no doubt that She played really well this time & obviously that's why She is in the final.Bt u hv 2 accept the fact that the side draw she got was far more easier than the other side.<br>  The player She defeated are good no doubt bt none of them are playing their best tennis.I think currently players who are in Best form are Venus,Dementieva, not in best bt still in good form Serena.<br>  <br>  So now She will face the real challenge,now if She can really beat Venus then it will not be a fluke & She will really prove that She earn it.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	She is certainly having her best tournament yet and is a heavy hitter.

If she wins against Venus Williams, it would be in three sets and that would give her a big boost. A win against the William sisters is always a big thing for the women players and it would mean a lot to Virginie Razanno if she can win tomorrow. I agree with you that she has a lot of potential.
h5lOMoqBaa	1. Taker hated the gimmick because he likes kayfabe and the ABA gimmick was too close to his real persona to be a true gimmick for him, so he actually wanted to be the dead man again<br>  2. The ABA name did not suit the name THE UNDERTAKER<br>  <br>  3. PERSONALLY, MY FAVORITE UNDERTAKER PERSONA WAS THE EVIL MINISTRY TAKER|`|vCidaEbCaa	he was just going through a phase he even "introduced" john Cena as his student in those days hell check you-tube for triple h's intro he was a VERY different character then|`|H7p09fL2aa	he turned in the american badass undertaker<br>  i actually like that gimmick more than the deadman<br>  the entrance lasted less and he could talk normally|`|D5Kl3BEqaa	Times were changing so Vinnie Mac wanted his wrestlers to be, how can I put this, more realistic.|`|0uH1utd5aa	Because it was different and he looks good in leather|`|3icTrKLLaa	Learn your wrestling history. Watch ppvs from 1990-2004 so you won't have to ask questions like this anymore.<br>  <br>  Taker had a biker gimmick from  2001-04....watch those years if you want to see it.
zu0W6hCTaa	he wouldn't have been swimming in the first place then................|`|baQpo0kdaa	he may still lose all his endorsments, it's still in the works|`|YYLzML9gaa	of course, he wont get into any major trouble, hes famous.. yet all his sponsers forgave him and hes back to making millions... society today....|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Please, just stop.  Your are being completely ignorant.|`|AA10425091	you are correct. if he waas black he would be on 60 minutes with kids// "You let us down"--He is White so he is white washed.|`|8FnZtEbEaa	he would be a black swimmer....|`|eSYLmcVpaa	Aggressive KFC endorsements.|`|7mjc1kjdaa	You're joking, right? Usually when you make a statement like that, you want to have some sort of precedent on your side. In your case, you don't. A number of black athletes have been stripped of their medals for using PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING drugs IN-SEASON by the IOC. Never has an athlete been sanctioned for smoking weed in the off-season.|`|aTwEUANXaa	he would be black and therefore sink in the water.    its science dude    black = sink    white = float
tfotPdeZaa	No, actually we are trying not to get relegated. But the Carling Cup would be a nice little bonus :) As for last night, that was not our usual line-up and they def. could have tried harder.|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Nope.. He rested<br>  <br>  Pelacios Modric Lennon Taraabt Woodgate Ekotto o hara all for hull on Monday.. I cant believe it... I can understand fielding a weak team next thursday as only 3 days later is the final... But there was 4 days in between Last night and hull on Monday So to leave ALL those players at home is a joke..... HE could have taken them and left them on the bench or only left half of them.... 4 days is loads of time to rest.... And no we did not try our hardest to win last night.... Did you see the line up.... To be fair we looked set for a draw but in the last ten mins 2 goals... I fully blame Harry...  he could have gone all out with a strong team last night and hopefully WON by 2 goals then he could have rested players next week... But we have already thrown it away.... We HAVE to beat UTD, as players like Modric Corluka Lennon will all want to be in Europe next season....|`|uXrQxxWMaa	No.  There is the return UEFA Cup match which we will win 5-1 with a far stronger team.  The Carling Cup which we will win 3-2 and the league matches which we need to get 45 points from by the end of the season.|`|755866731a4c1745b79ba767287f47e3aa	why are spurs so interested in winning the carling cup ?.All it does is get you a place in the uefa cup  and they tried there best to get knocked out of that last night .So what is the point......|`|KDChZAzlaa	I think the Carling cup is a bit above their station.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Any cup is a bonus , and why should United care about it , after all it is the mickey mouse cup . I reckon United should let Sours win it , because you have plenty of trophy's . Be a good smartain club .
RLoilwCNaa	Tough question, wow. I've been siting here thinking about it and I just don't know. I guess I will have to go with the Dream, but I can't really give any reason Malone shouldn't be picked either.|`|awMnTrEHaa	Hakeem Olajuwon....easy. He's the career blocks leader(at least ever since blocks became a statistic), moved like a two guard, shot great free throws, had an inside outside game, the "Dream Shake" his signature move is possibly second only to Kareem's "sky hook" as the most undefendable move by a center, need i say more???? I would take "the Dream" over all centers. That combination of skills he possessed is unmatched for a center. Don't believe me????, research it and compare his game!|`|4DcvpQXfaa	The Dream<br>  <br>  He has unstoppable post moves and all time leader in blocking
GswnLKtQaa	One of the best centers all-time, he's a old day dwight howard a monster on the boards.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	Uhmm.....we didnt forget Moses Malone.<br>  <br>  Just because we dont talk about him doesnt mean we "forgot" about him.<br>  <br>  This question doesnt deserve a star.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Moses??? Is he that guy in the bible? Naw I'm just playing. He was alright. Anyone before MJ, Larry, and Magic (besides Wilt and Bill Russell) are hard to remember.|`|qoYLjfxvaa	I don't think people have. People recognize him as one of the greatest centers of all time. Not top 5, but top 10 for sure.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	i have no idea,but Moses was a great player. i guess he just faded away due to time.<br>  Star if i like?????<br>  like what...you????<br>  &^^& no if ur a boyy!!<br>  i aint none of dat gay ****.
sPiwb8Hraa	No bad brief comments from me. If the interest is there I would be all for it.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	HOW CAN HE EXPLAIN THE QUESTION ANY BETTER LoL ITS I VERY SIMPLE QUESTION AND A GREAT ON AT THAT DONT ANSWER IT IF YOU DONT GET IT OR CANT READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    if they do have a team i think they should have to play all their first 8 games here and the last 8 at home so they dont go back and forth i believe there will be 2 London team one outta england and one outta ireland which is apart of the UK so there will be the London _________  and the Belfast____________ well i hope they have an Irish team cuz im irsih lol but there will be 2 expansion teams they cant only add one team but the MLB said the same thing about having a expansion team in puerto rico and canada since the Expos turn to the wash. nationals  but that never happend i also heard the Braves were moving to puerto rico and this was on the Offical web site on the atlanta braves so it wasnt just a rumor this came straight outta ted turners mouth so i diont know if this will even happen at ALL .It would be awesome though Good question hope this was a good answer!!!!|`|p8ahZa8iaa	I think the only way this would work is if you actually brought in 3 other European teams so they could form their own division and not have to travel so much.    How about Paris, Berlin, and Amsterdam?|`|mTSOJKlyaa	lmao i love how at the bottom of the article it has a video of the guide to American football basics    such a large fanbase ans interest yet they dont know the basics|`|1Byis7Flaa	No, it will be in 2010 when the Chargers lease is up on Jack Murphy, Qual Com Stadium in San Diego,  Because San Diego, will not want anything to do with Spanos,  LA doesn't want anything to do with Spanos, so the only other option is  Mexico or London. Mexico won't have the money, so it is London|`|AA11097612	I understand that in order for the game to survive and thrive it is better for it to become an INTERNATIONAL game.  As a fan of the game, however, it all makes me very irritated.  I say this because as there are more and more teams being added the quality of play will go down because players who couldn't get into the NFL because they just weren't good enough now will be playing.  I know, I know... players like Harrison of the Steelers was cut 4 times and is now the Defensive Player of the Year but he is the exception rather than the rule, don't you think?    Also, imagine the burden of increased travel costs to each team if they have to travel to Europe.  And the European team's travel expenses would be incredibly high as they will have to travel even more times to America.  This additional cost will make free agency more difficult as there will not be as much money to pay the players.      I hope it doesn't happen.  It would be the beginning of the end for the NFL.|`|dRiBGoJkaa	i don't, after obamas 'buy american' comments i think the world should boycott anything american, anyway american football isn't a real mans sport like rugby, they wear body armour what a bunch of pus....|`|cCLv7G6saa	que? n?o entendi sua pergunta please! explain better
fHxpycJSaa	Good one, hadn't thought about that. How about all the teams that passed on Santonio Holmes and didn't draft him? After all, if he's not a Steeler, he can't make that catch.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	They should blame Troy Polamalu.|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	They should blame themselves for not beating the Steelers|`|njLVIp55aa	No...Ravens blame the refs for the stupid penalty they called against the ravens right before half time for roughing the kicker when nobody touched the fruitcake!!         Quit posting these stupid questions!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	They are blaming Wacco Flacco, but they can't be too harsh because he is still green and needs work. I think he will do well in the coming years.|`|UxooffHZaa	I don't think the Cardinals would have beat the Ravens. It's been some time since the NFC has had a team as good as the top tier of the AFC. This year they closed the gap some, but they're not there yet. Ravens and Steelers were both better than any of the NFC teams.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No... the Ravens would've not only beat the Cardinals... they would've actually covered the spread... the Cardinals should thank the Ravens and Joe Flacco for allowing them to actually compete against the Steelers.|`|Iq4qLnobaa	Whatever dude. It's a game. Someone has to lose and someone has to win.|`|6J5mQWj0aa	nope because you win as a team you loss as a team|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Yeah, lets just blame all those other teams for losing to the Steelers this year too. Its all their fault, stupid Chargers, Ravens etc...|`|d607a21fdcb4f89c933a232a552075c8aa	My thinking is this, when you lose or win you do it as a team the blame should not rest on persons shoulder, I saw alot of mistakes but not  by just one person.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Can't blame the ravens! They would have beaten the cards! And so would any team that made the playoffs for the AFC!|`|jLOCqhckaa	.Altought there both to blame.You can't blame Troy Polamalu because it's his job. In Flacco's case...everyone makes mistakes and he's a rookie with no playoff experience. Plus Cards offense shreds the Ravens defense
j2xGuTaaaa	I think that this will be the best WM ever!<br>  Triple H vs Randy Orton would be an incredible match and I hope it happens.<br>  Edge vs John Cena- I guess would be a pretty good match,seeing as they had great matches in the past.<br>  HBK vs The Undertaker- This is my dream WWE match. This is one that all of the fans want to see and would become an instant classic.<br>  Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy-This would be a good match no matter what, but I think it should be a TLC match if it happens.<br>  <br>  So,yes I am definitley looking forward to WresleMania 25.<br>  I'm hoping to see the winner of the MITB match cash in that night,because nobody's ever done that.|`|HfYXXUhBaa	I think that as it's the 25th anniversary something big will go off. I don't think we'll have any underdogs winning world titles like Rey Mysterio did, there underdogs in wwe are not ready at the moment (Kofi Kingtson, John Morrison). I think Stone Cold will be involved, we have see in the past, Hall of Fame entrants making big impacts to the same WrestleMania, (Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair), and i like your idea of the MITB winner cashing in that night, I think we'll see Jack Swagger Vs Christian for the ECW title, and maybe a Batista return. Rumours are also pointing to Evan Bourne returning for the MITB match, looking forward to it i must say!|`|fBGq6BL6aa	You can also expect to see Moolah vs Sensational Sherri in a "Diva From The Dead" Match<br>  <br>  I also heard that Bastian Booger is coming back and he's going to take on whoever is the champion at the end of the show.|`|36B9Cl29aa	Yeah this could be a big mania. or it could be a sucky one if they mess it up.|`|cgTjTxsMaa	Yes your right|`|NRs72Afxaa	That is something that will remain to be seen. I think WM25 card is looking strong in over the past 2 years. <br>  <br>  Will their be surprises at WM? Thats something will have to wait and see.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	I gotta say YES! <br>  <br>  <br>  First off, we got Stone Cold Steve Austin finally gettin' his spot in the WWE Hall of Fame! Then, we got the WWE Championship on the line: <br>  <br>  The Game, TRIPLE H (c) vs The Legend Killer, RANDY ORTON<br>  <br>  <br>  Orton is the Royal Rumble winner and this year we could see the resurrection of the AGE...OF...ORTON! <br>  <br>  I ain't too excited 'bout the World Title match, we might just see another John Cena vs Edge. <br>  <br>  And, the Hardy Boyz in: BROTHER vs BROTHER! This'll be awesome no matter what match they're in! <br>  <br>  I won't be surprised to see Evan "Air" Bourne return and win the M.I.T.B Ladder match, but that'll suck major sh*t! :( <br>  <br>  We could see Y2J, Chris Jericho vs Hulk Hogan at WM*25*<br>  <br>  And, then there's the Main Event: 16-0 at Wrestlemania!!!!|`|H7p09fL2aa	yeah this wrestlemania will be way better than 21,22,23 and 24 <br>  i mean Triple h vs Randy orton in a great storyline<br>  edge vs cena is not that great but the rest of wrestlemania would be great<br>  HBK vs undertaker will be the best match of the night if it happens mr wrestlemania vs the undefeated at wM and it's on texas<br>  Matt vs Jeff would be great if its a ladder or extreme rules match<br>  and jericho might be fighting a legend like hogan,flair or austin so that would be great too<br>  and not to forget the money in the bank<br>  we have superstars like r-truth,morrison,benjamin and some more superstars that can make that match great<br>  it will be a great wrestlemania<br>  but not as big as 17|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	Surely Stephanie is going to turn heel and reveal she's been in league with Randy all along. I look forward to seeing how full of rage Triple H will look when he finds out :)|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I dunno, let me check the script...|`|TBu2iaPaaa	yes always
7Xridrxaaa	wtf? NOOOOOOOOOO i am sure Kun already decided that he will grow up in Independiente's fuerzas basicas. When Benji scores against Boca in the Bombonera, it will prove as a kodak moment for all of us Independiente fans haha<br>  <br>  AGUANTE EL ROJO!!!! Rey de copas?? hahaha bosteros pu*os (i am a get my *** kicked for that arent i? haha)|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I doubt Diego would allow him to be anything but a Boca fan. It's a given.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	haha im sure he is:P Aguante Boca!
xKXu0Qb2aa	FEAR NOT - The FUTURE has Risen from the Ashes , More Pissed Off than Ever.  The WS just made a Huge Mistake in F*cking with the Savior.    WS Haters -   *WARNING* - A Fresh can of the @ss Whip is always handy.      Great Match Ideas Clown.  I was thinking that too , KANE Might actually Win.        Let the Masses Know - I have Returned............|`|oAjbBLDpaa	I was thinking Kane wins the title and gets Cena and Orton at Wrestlemania. I don't think the WWE wants to transfer it's top heel in Orton to Smackdown right now especially since Edge and Big Show are doing pretty well currently and Matt Hardy seems promising.     Kane really is the only one that makes sense to come out of the chamber as champion besides Cena retaining. Kofi is just not ready to main event Wrestlemania, Rey Mysterio was basically lowered to mid-card with the Intercontinental Champ tournament, Mike Knox...not much to say there, and Jericho seems to have other storylines with Rourke Flair and his apology to Stephanie...Also, we've seen Orton and Cena go at it last year to hype the main event so I think they should give us something new for the anniversary and Kane would be a great way of doing that (but that might be because I'm Kane biased =))    I really think that, given the circumstances, Kane is a possible candidate for the next WHC.|`|8Im1iGFTaa	ya but sadly kane wont win the title
oNR7il8baa	The name's Leonel Benjamin Aguero Maradona Dammit!!! <br>  <br>  He's gonna be sexy [If he's not I blame the mother] <br>  He has an amazingly good looking father <br>  He's gonna School Mexico when he plays them :P Ouch. <br>  He's gonna play for Boca like his Grandaddy =] <br>  He is a Colchonero & Bostero I can tell I already ordered the shirt with his name<br>  If the Gatitos ever make it to the finals with Boca or any game... He'll score... TWICE :P <br>  <br>  Oh my Jesus watch him become a priest and let me down :(|`|Yb0182Vxaa	conceited|`|pwtmMGMWaa	That giannina girl is dam.n lucky! She doesnt know how to peel a tomato (just to give an example), she barely finished high school and she's not even pretty!!. But why would she need to go to uni when she's maradona's daughter? if he someday gets mad at her she will still have aguero but if he also gets mad at her she still has the baby! so nothing to worry about!! she can live in a big house with a pool full of $$$ for the rest of her life, yep life is sooo unfair :((((<br>  <br>  attributes? HA! what do u expect me to say? kick penalties better than anyone else ever when he's not even 96hs old??|`|FgF39gBZaa	lol.. he is up there.. of course, behind a lot of people from this ONE club..
zb40cLwOaa	WQ: No its a good storyline for Randy as his character is somewhat boring otherwise, you can thumb me down for that but it's the truth there's not much depth to the Randy Orton character.    WQ2: Kanes always worked well in teams and Knox and him are a great powerhouse team they're both pretty damn good in the ring, tag team titles maybe? Who knows.    As for Raw I agree it will be crazy with Taker and Flair both appearing, i'm looking forward to watching it.|`|MTQ2dmWJaa	1.no  2.no way|`|jMO9kDfWaa	Randy Orton thingy is kool, i wish i had IED lol. but i can see him turningin face by kicking people in the head and he realizes that its wrong to do that after awile, cuz his face after he does that stuff is like, "Wat did i just do?". Then he starts fighting clean like Eddie did before he passed.    Kane and Knox would destroy as a tag team, Knox's beard is bigger than Rey's head. I dont like knox that much though.|`|XkBzfEBUaa	a)   yes, much too much, but they've been lacking problems with the management ever since Stone Cold & The Rock, so expect it to get waaaaay played out    b)  they will do so-so (look at the team from TNA Abyss and Matt Morgan) (they were dominant, but big men's personalities collide)  I can totally see this happening with Kane & Knox....one hits the other with a chair accidentally, all hell breaks loose causing one good rivalry|`|dGYR81enaa	No and yes|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I think there is going to be a bit too much talking on raw, like there was last night.     I really like the idea of kane and knox as a team. Hopefully they will keep this up for a while.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	it going to suck and that a fact! The fact it suck it this week should tell you some thing wow 3 dumb people out there! and you relly think a old ric flair will do anything  and the undertaker will steal the show wow people are dumb!|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	the IED has become boring..    but regarding RAW next week, as much as i want to see orton get destroyed by Taker, i dont think it will happen.    and yes, Kane and Knox will make a killer tag team|`|KIOR56r6aa	WQ : Yes    WQ2 : Why not?|`|gVlTlpb2aa	orton will rest in peace|`|sqfjfR3iaa	It's going to be the final Raw before the next Pay Per View 6 days later. It's supposed to lay some of the groundwork for some of the matches at Wrestlemania XXV, so it should be a great show. The Undertaker does not come on Raw that often, WWE needs to make this show a good one.    Not a bad idea, if the WWE wants to put together another dominant tag team.|`|VmoNpWddaa	WQ: No    WQ2: They would make great rivals.|`|3u1FaRe0aa	I think
3m9DQuDRaa	The WWE is turning everything back to PG, trying to be more "family friendly" (which makes a whole lick of sense when the whole show is based on violence...  go fig, violence is ok on TV, but sex and language isn't...  but violence isn't ok in reality, and sex and language are?  What the hell is wrong with that picture...  ANYWAY...)    In attempt to be kid friendly, they removed the "f*ck you" references from the FU and the STFU.  The FU (the elevated fireman's carry to powerslam) is now called the Throwback (though that was originally that overhead neckbreaker he used to do, now just called a facebuster...)...  and the STFU is now just the STF.    STF means Stepover Toehold Facelock, which is what the move is (hence why Cena started using it, because he could easily just call it the STFU and get away with it).      ----------------  On a personal note:     It's sad that the WWE thinks more about the kids that watch, and choose to alienate where the money comes from in the first place.    Think of it like this.  Right now, kids are watching it because their parents enjoyed it.  But once the parents stop enjoying it, their money base will start to lower again...    Top that with my question from above as to why it's ok to view violence but not sex and language, but in reality we don't punish sex and language, but violence gets you jail time?  Where the hell is our priorities?|`|F3VjJAdiaa	i think it's part of the new pg rating. cause from stfu you get "FU"|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Yes the FU is now the Throwback and the STFU is the STF. (the real question is what dose STF stand for?) But the point is to make Cena more kid friendly.|`|AA11482019	That's the real name of the hold.  It stans for Stepover Toehold Facelock.|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	Agree with first answer, it's laziness! lol    btw i predicted long before the match that Jericho would have tapped out to the STF, (sorry the STFU) cuz Cena said he was gonna shut Jericho up.    So predictable WWE!|`|dGYR81enaa	Yep|`|khU8m4gxaa	Yeah, they've stopped calling it that & are now calling it by it's real name the STF (Stepover Toehold Facelock). They were adding the U just for Cena. Trying to be funny or edgy. They've also changed the FU. They called it the "throwback", then last week Michael Cole, just yelled "there it is!", with no name. Last night, Lawler said it was called the "attitude adjustment". I guess they're undecided.|`|h9SQn62Oaa	Yeah i think so, or they're just lazy.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	It's already been a while ... because STFU is associated with     SHUT THE FCK UP    because WWE IS  RATED PG... so they change the name of the move.... KID FRIENDLY... thing SUCKS...|`|3ExtDP45aa	Maybe they were getting complaints because of what it stood for....    I don't think it sounds right though, but i'm think its because i'm used to hearing STFU|`|SBzfbIU3aa	Yes they changed it in the last few weeks because of wwe's pg rating!  they also changed the fu to 'the throwback' for the same reason!    in JR's blog he says hes happy bou the change as it makes it much easier to  explain to his young niece wat it means!!|`|lr68XuMFaa	They are too lazy to say it fully so they call it the STF
aUGM3ju6aa	About time you said something that made sense. Anyways, you're right. A lot of Laker fans been acting really cocky. Last night I was in a bar and Laker fans were saying, "Who are we going to meet in the Finals because we'll be there for sure. It's a wrap!" Dude the Laker fans in that bar made you guys (All Laker Fans) look silly. They were acting really cocky!|`|dDhTMacAaa	I think these are statements that do the opposite of get you in the NBA Finals.<br>  <br>  The Lakers are clearly, hands-down, the best team in the West and probably the best team in the NBA, but anything can happen come playoff time.<br>  <br>  They could draw a poor matchup or just suck for a bad stretch of time. It's all possible and the Lakers know that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  They should be in the Finals, and you and I and mostly everyone knows it, but they are 0% guranteed a lock.|`|reIMLCKkaa	I think we are the favorite but It worries me how everyone thinks we are a lock. It seems like they are just setting us up for dissapointment. I hope the team doesnt take tha attitude into the post season, They need to play hard because anything can happen. There are a lot of talented teams|`|KTp27Fokaa	The Pacers a lock for sure. They are gonna go undefeated from now on and climb to the 3 spot in the East. Then they go undefeated in the playoffs.<br>  <br>  Well, I can hope, can't I?|`|0eMQDINbaa	Anything can happen within the course of the next 2 months. Kobe could get injured, Ariza could get injured, Gasol could get injured. You never know what could happen so its pointless to say a team is a lock in the finals. Not to mention the Lakers have to get past the Spurs so its not like they have no competition.<br>  <br>  I know what you said. I was referring to what you said about the Radio show.|`|vJyF8siJaa	I believe so, the Lakers doesn't have any real challenge yet in the West.|`|xfD4z4pmaa	Yes anything can happen but they are deep. They have exactly what a team needs to get there.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	have to beat Denver / Spurs|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I would never say they are a guaranteed pick in the finals, but they should have no problem getting there with the teams they have to play and the home court advantage they will get.  Those people who say that are just overzealous fans and need to chill.

1Byis7Flaa	I saw the fight live, and I could not understand how GSP was slipping out of that triangle.  I was, "How the heck did he do that?"    Then I saw the videos online..    And I watched the fight again on TV.      I think GSP should either be stripped of the belt,   Fined huge $  And an immediate rematch with BJ Penn (If Penn wants it, at any weight for Penn)    That was Vaseline, and BJ's legs, and arms just slipped right off and over GSP. That is cheap!    We will never know if GSP would've survived that second round and the triangle's BJ was trying to put GSP in.|`|sjyp5zTlaa	I think his corner man needs to be bounced to the unemployment line.|`|u93eagkqaa	George is no champ when it comes to BJJ so do you really think he is that much better than anyone else in the world? Occam's Razar folks do you think someone with no background in BJJ can just pass BJs guard?    GSP cheated this wasn't the first time they rubbed that stuff on him he knew. He probably didn't have to cheat, but he did so ban him and his corner for a while.|`|QM2A6rBlaa	Bj lost(thankfully) and all of your whining and crying and saying he cheated is not going to change that. For an answer look at the one above.    BJ talked trash, and then gassed out. I used to like him but now I think he is just a punk. talking trash is one thing, but you at least better be able to back it up, which he didn't.|`|OiAl6w48aa	First off, it was NOT "all over his upper body".  Commissioner Kizer himself stated that the amount he personally saw applied was "not excessive" and that it was immediately wiped off once he brought it to the attention of GSP's corner.  Here's the most recent article on it: http://mmajunkie.com/news/13895/kizer-pe...    Second, the poster who is saying that GSP has "no background in BJJ" has no idea what he's talking about.  GSP is not only a world class wrestler, but he also earned a brown belt in BJJ from Renzo Gracie, and then a black belt from Fabio Holanda.  The man knows how to fight on the ground.  The vaseline, if any, was on his back - not his neck, shoulders, etc.  It did not have an impact on his ability to pull out of BJ's guard or attempted chokes.    Third, the ONLY round where the vaseline was actually on his body was the 1st round.  After that, Commissioner Kizer made sure it was wiped off going into rounds 2, 3 and 4.      Fourth, obviously, the introduction of any foreign substance onto a fighter's body is just wrong.  The commission has not taken any action against GSP for a reason: because the amount involved here was miniscule, and it did not have any impact on the outcome of the fight.  The bottom line is that BJ gassed out and got the stuffing knocked out of him.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	It was stupid.  I would bet a thousand dollars that GSP didn't want it and wasn't aware of it. (yes, it is VERY possible he wasn't aware of it.  You can't feel the vaseline and while you're in the corner, you're used to people touching and rubbing your shoulders and neck.  It's not what you're thinking about.)      The corner man's story is that he put vaseline on his fighters face (standard stuff) and then rubbed his shoulders, not thinking about the vaseline left on his hands.  At any rate, an observer cried foul, and they toweled off the vaseline.  Although apparently not in the second round.  But then, no one actually saw his get greased up inbetween the first and second round.    It's an unfortunate tarnish on an excellent performance by St.Pierre.      Here's what should happen, because this is an issue:    1) The fight should be taken off both fighter's records and declared void.  Basically, it never happened.    2) GSP retains his title, Penn gets a shot at it when he's ready.    3) Cornerman suspended for one year and then put on a probationary period for a couple of years after that.  (I'm willing to believe he made a mistake, but it was a dumb mistake that has caused a lot of drama.)      4) Cornerman writes for publication a hearfelt apology to Penn and GSP, to Zuffa and the UFC fans for basically being an idiot.    5) GSP forfeits his pay for the fight.  Even if the issue wasn't his fault, he has to take responsibility for his corner.  Losing the belt is too much, but being fined the night's pay seems fair to me.  He can make it up in GSP v Penn 3.

CgzgTNPAaa	actually i think its called a flip turn, but anyway you swim as your would normally, and get really close to the wall and do a front flip. while pushing your legs from the wall, turn back onto your stomach and come up and continue swimming. MAKE SURE you breathe out of your nose continuously or your will get water up your nose. its hard when you first learn it but just give it time. you might also want to look on youtube for some demonstrations. these really help your time because it's faster than stopping, and then pushing off and starting again. good luck!|`|onySROuhaa	Not much information.  But since its in swimming, if you are trying to do a flip during backstroke you simply rollover when you are about an arms length from the wall and do a normal flip turn.  Just when stay on your back though coming out of the turn rather than rolling to your stomach.|`|r5bNX3juaa	Here's what my coach keeps telling our swim team: Swim into the wall to get your stroke count.

YDpT2ClBaa	the minimum score is the lowest they will let me give.<br>  i usually start in the middle with a 5. depending on there focus, timing, balance, stances, power, etc i go up or down with the score. if they make a mistake i take off points. i've given a couple of the lowest scores, for forgetting the kata, or dropping a weapon.<br>  <br>  edit:> when i first stared judging my teach told me that the most important part is to stay consistent during the judging. if you start out low never readjust your score to complaisant just keep it all the same. and that is something i have always gone by.|`|AA11264943	I am usually judging children, and I would never give a young child a zero.  But I have pulled them off and talked to them.  <br>  <br>  I don't start at zero or 10.  I have never given a 10, and I have seen forms where errors were not made, it just wasn't worthy of a 10.  I don't think I've ever gone below 6.5.  <br>  <br>  James|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	At tournaments that I attend there is a range set and an average within that range set prior to the division starting.  The first three competitors do their form and then you call them each back up for score.  The best of those three should be given the highest score, the second best the next highest score and third best the lowest score of the three.  Given the rank of the division and the quality of the technique and their kata determines also if it was just average for that rank or better than average for that rank.  Obviously if it was only average while the other two were better then it would get something around that average score while the other two would be scored higher.  This gives you a baseline from which you can then judge and score the rest of the competitors and you score each after they do their form from then on.  That is why it is best to go towards the end as judges will tend to score a fraction lower in the beginning so as not to top out in the range that is set for that division.  An experienced judge can tell what an average kata is verses one that is poorly done or one that shows exceptional skill and execution though but even with five or seven judges in national competition it comes down to just a few hundredths of a point.  High and low scores are thrown out anytime five or seven judges are used and when only three judges are used then they take all the scores but in the event of a tie they either do another kata or sometimes they also throw out the lowest score since two of the three judges favored one of the competitors over the other so far as scoring goes.|`|v1mbL56caa	I have been requested to judge at several local tournaments. I have mixed feelings always. I have given a 0 once to one competitor for not only doing poorly but showing disrespect for fellow competitions as well. Occasionally I have been be called to judge an art I am not as familiar with as Taekwando for kata. In these cases as well as weapons I have confer with other judges and base my grade of 0 to 10 based on attitude, energy, balance, and intent. I usually mentally start with a 5 in mind and go up or down based on these qualities. When I judge Taekwando I am comfortable enough to start at 10 and go up and down as I see these qualities and errors. <br>  Other than the one occasion I gave a 0 I have never given less than a 5 on a 0 to 10 scale, not because I believe no one deserves a lower score, I just haven't seen anyone that bad in the several tournaments I have been asked to judge.|`|8BwvOuIXaa	I usually start with the middle number, i.e. 5, as a starting point thinking this is a score for a kata that is done proficiently and give or take points based on attitude, technique, execution, stances, positioning, etc.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Like you I start hi and deduct but I start at 9 not 10 .10 assumes a perfect kata I have never or will ever give a 10 but there are a few exceptional kata practioners I have given a 9.9 twice in my life ..They did trad bo kata.One whose grip was so powerful when doing the bo version of uchi uke ripped the bo in two and had to start again.

Yes my Lebron. The guy is a much better shooter than Lebron and he's freaking 6"9 with a little explosiveness. If he continues to hit the weights then the sky is the limit. Playoffs next year? I think its possible. <br>  <br>  Heres how it could go down. They can trade their top pick this summer for a veteran big. I'd put Green as a sixth man if they got someone who is a better starting pf. You cant have Durant playing the 2. You find a servicable starting 2(which Thabo might be), you trade for a veteran pf or center, you move Green to the 6th man role. <br>  <br>  Possible bigs that may be available are Chris Bosh, Carlos Boozer, Amare Stoudemire, and Lamar Odom. I think if they gave up Jeff Green, and a high first rounder(oh say, Blake Griffin), they could pry away Bosh. So you build with Durant, Bosh, and Westbrook. <br>  <br>  If Oklahoma makes some gutsy trades, they may be my sleeper team next year. They'd have to make alot moves though. They have the assets. And they can be players in 2010 possibly for Wade or Bosh. Its safe to say the Thunder is the team of the future.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	I agree with what you said. They have a lot of young, raw talent. Saying they might make the playoffs next year may be a long shot, buy hey, maybe they will be the next Tampa Bay Rays.|`|siUTSyO7aa	Good comparison between the Thunder and Blazers. They do have a lot of young talent but i give it 2-3 years before they make the playoffs.<br>  Durrant is a beast!|`|4ujEpNLsaa	Probably 3 years my guess.  The other teams will be too old and they will be in there prime.|`|eF60R7DPaa	they do..in the future they will be one of the best in the NBA|`|qtwYHyH5aa	they will be the next heat|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	It will take time and as we wait, we wouldn't even notice that Durant will be traded to a contender team. There is no one in OKC that complements Durant's offense. He's the go-to-guy but he needs a sidekick or sidekicks. Thabo is a help in Seattle's defense but the thing is that Sefolosha is just new and it will take time to fit in with the new team. And what they still lacks is the man in the middle, not really a superstar caliber but a role player.
Cl6KbcAGaa	if it is a hard tail with front end suspension with lock-out then it makes all the sense in the world. If it is full suspension then it does not make much sense as you loose too much pedaling efficiency absorbed by the rear suspension. If you use a thinner tire then you stand to gain less rolling resistance and have the potential of going faster....Nothing wrong with a MTB in flat cities I have four of them and they are all f/s and I make it work  but I use my road bike for the long hauls!|`|Z5xgSATSaa	You might ask the question what is the point of a mountain bike on the road at all. If you ride exclusively on the road, there are better choices. Even on flat roads, the wind is sometimes in your face and lower gears are very useful|`|mAZi1eH7aa	So you can do those speed bumps better than anyone else in town.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	I think most everyone already answered your question. Mountain bikes can be used on roads since the position is more comfortable, can take potholes and road hazards better, and if you use smooth skinnier tires then it becomes more efficient.<br>  <br>  One thing I can add is, if you commute in a unfriendly area, you can use it to hop curbs to get on sidewalks should you find the traffic intimidating. You can also use it for shortcuts that are either dirt, or unpaved paths. Although now I use a cyclocross bike which can do all the above as well.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	The frame geometry of a mountain bike, combined with their bigger tires and suspension forks, makes them more comfortable to ride than what  road bikes are.<br>  <br>  Your body is in a more upright position ~ which works well for those who are unable to or who have no desire in being bent over a set of drop handlebars, riding in pace lines on hard skinny tires, feeling every bump in the road, and fixing flats while traffic is whizzing by.<br>  <br>  If you don't enjoy riding a bike, you won't ride it. Mountain bikes are fun to ride both in the mountains and on flat city streets.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	I guess it depends on the bike. Mountain bikes come in lots of forms. You can customize them for ever day flat city use or otherwise. An example would be if your just driving on paved roads, you really dont need any suspension. But, if you are downhill riding on dirt and rocks, you would want full suspension, front and back shocks. If you do occasional trail riding then front shocks do the trick, makes it easy on your wrists. Also there are tires specific for street riding and trail riding. Whatever you are using it for is what you need to make adjustments for.|`|3rn64F9gaa	so you can go up curbs... thats why i like it|`|aQcsrgLCaa	None.

Hxttt7G0aa	Choose a cane pole or light-weight rod & reel, 2-6 pound test line, and a small, barbed hook (sizes #6, 8, or 10) with a bobber (for fishing for shallow or suspended fish) attached 12-18 inches from the hook, with a small split-shot sinker attached 8-10 inches from the hook. <br>  Use live bait (Panfish worms, night crawlers, baby crawfish 1-2in, small minnows 1in). Or try fresh bread. These fish love bread! Just mash it around the hook into a hard ball. You'll lose a few, but it's easy and fairly cheap. A good way to keep stale bread on the hook is to make a peanut-butter sandwich on 1 piece of bread, fold it in half, and tear off little pieces, mashing it onto and concealing the hook. <br>  Watch your line or bobber for any movement. These fish can be very gentle biters at times, especially in cool weather, and with a nibble or two, your bait will be gone if you are not paying attention. <br>  Set your hook gently. The fish you expect on the other end of the line has a small, tender mouth, and jerking the line too hard will snatch the hook from the fish's mouth. <br>  If you prefer, use a small lure or even a fly. Small, black or dark-colored ones work well. Bottom fishing (using several heavy sinkers close to the hook), drift fishing (for running water), or fly fishing are some options. <br>  Small spinnerbaits like Beetlespins or Mimic Minnows will also catch bluegill, and by trolling these or drifting while you cast, you will cover a larger area in a shorter time, hopefully discovering a "honey hole", or a location where these fish congregate in numbers. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>  The aquatic insects bluegill eat prefer clearer water with abundant underwater plants. <br>  In cooler seasons, larger bluegill stay near or in the shallows, and spawn there as well. <br>  In late summer and early fall, they move out to deeper, cooler water. They often swim in schools. <br>  Fishing is best in the daylight, when they're most prone to feed. <br>  If you are looking for small bluegills you want to fish by the shore near some kind of structure or cover where the small fish can hide from predators. <br>  One of the best baits for a bluegill is red worms. In some locations, meal worms, golden meal worms, catalpa worms, crickets, and even maggots are effective. <br>  If you are looking for a bass or a catfish you want to use the baby bluegill for bait, where they are legal. <br>  If you are looking for a big fish you might want to use the guts for bait too. <br>  In some areas, it is legal to bait (chum) bluegills and other panfish or non-sport fish. This can be done either from shore or a boat, by throwing out rabbit feed pellets, cottonseed meal cakes, or chicken laying mash. Doing this at a regular fishing hole frequently over a period of days or weeks will almost guarantee you successful fishing.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	first, get some good polarized lens glasses.<br>  then get out your light spinning outfit and small crappie size grubs. inch or inch and a half.<br>  look for their pie pan size and shape beds in areas of pea size gravel. if all you have is a muddy bottom look for the cleanest areas. try to find a bit of gravel on a long shallow slope.<br>  lots of times, you will find a bed next to a big rock or a log.<br>  they will be shallow. as little as a foot, usually a bit more. as much as 4 - 5 feet.<br>  cast your grub or beetlespin past the nest and work it slowly through. if you have on a grub, stop it in the nest and jiggle it a bit.<br>  if memory serves me, they will begin spawning shortly after the bass. <br>  we have redear in my local lake. pretty much the same as bluegill but bigger.<br>  <br>  l pulled one big redear off it's nest 3 times. released each time. <br>  sure, fish are more vulnerable at spawning time but if you use artificials which work better anyway, catch and release is always a good option.<br>  and the sunfish population is not going to be damaged.<br>  <br>  one more note:<br>  what about salmon fishing in rivers? they are there to spawn. unethical to go after them? a lot of salmon fishers might not agree.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Almost anything will work when they are up on the spawn beds but I usually just use a piece of crawler on a #10 Tru Turn hook under a bobber.  I don't know the temperature but they go up pretty shallow where you can easily spot them, in most cases.  I have caught them on all sorts of lures as well with small jigs and poppers being my favorites.  Good luck!|`|AA12103790	while its legal i question the ethics of fishing for anything over a spawing bed. IMHO its not fair chase.

xRPjgGs1aa	Do not do this trade you are giving away 3 All-stars for only 2 of them. Prince has been very consistent this year and Jake Peavy can be a runner-up for the CY Young award in 2009. Soto is the #1 catcher in the National Leauge. Joe has been the one of the best catcher's in the game from 2006, but in 2008 Justin had been struggling. So I suggest to not do the trade. If you want to do the trade you ahould ask for one more player Johan Santana or John Lackey or any other pitcher who has stats similar as that.|`|J048Slgbaa	Maur and Morneau for Soto and Fielder is a fair trade but don't add Peavy...that is completely lopsided for the other guy.  Try to deal an equal pitcher from him.|`|kiAJGdlbaa	no...soto and mauer are about even, same with fielder and morneau. also you would be giving up one of the best pitchers in peavy   don't do it|`|6AfM6SWaaa	no|`|Ch40nAvCaa	You are forgetting two of the unwritten rules of Fantasy Baseball- Never trade the last rookie of the year (especially after what happened to Pedroia) and never trade a young gun like Fielder.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	It's not even close.<br>  Mauer hits for an excellent average, but has little power.  Morneau is a solid 25-35 home run hitter with an excellent average and high RBIs.<br>  Fielder had an "off" year last year and still hit more homers than Morneau.  His RBI total wasn't that far off either.  Soto has only had one year in the bigs, but if he repeats his rookie stats he will be a top five catcher in the game.  Jake Peavy is one of the top five in his position as well, and - if traded to a contender - could easily put up 20+ wins this year.  <br>  If you take this trade, you're getting hosed.  It sounds like you're only considering this deal because you're a Twins fan and you want guys from your team.

A whip under 1.250 or so is still quite good.

Although Nocioni is a better defender then Peja.|`|iquUINqlaa	I don't think he's going to be as productive as you think. He'll be coming off the bench behind Garcia. But he'll bring what has been lacking with the Kings, and that's playing 110% and going full speed. He plays hard, diving for lose balls and generally playing with a lot of energy. That energy was obviously not present with the previous roster and the younger players were learning that going half speed is ok, since they were going to lose anyways. If the "new" roster is able to pick up that same energy that Nocioni has, then the Kings will be a very different team from now on (aside from looking different because they just got a whole new team from all the trades).
qeu6vWCHaa	The Cardinals were absolutely screwed. Many of the penalties called against them were blown out of proportion.    Also, the fact that the booth didn't review the fumble at the end of the game is nothing shy of a cherry on top for the bad officiating.

So now that Vince is out of the picture, Shane is next. What is gonna happened is that over the next few week leading up No Way Out they are going to be hyping this storyline. Then at No Way Out Steph is gonna make some match like a no DQ match or something like that during the match both Randy and Shane are gonna be going back and forth then Shane is just weak and can't go on that is when Randy will punt Shane. Then being that Steph is ringside she run in to check on Shane then she get up with a VERY angry face then turn around and starts to smile and shake hands with Randy.

Steelers fan or not...they should be able to admit that was very uncalled for...    if that would have been a cardinal hitting a steeler like that then they ALL would be bitching like babies....|`|DRPhJnXzaa	whatever gets you through the night|`|DyORD0Zkaa	yea im with you all the way but u know that superbowl was rigged and the refs. were on the pittsburg side all along that is why they didnt do anything even in the game they called questionable calls like personal foul when the guy was already out and then got his face mask that is not a personal foul.|`|G99UDprmaa	Hell NO!,  Harrison did right, that little punk tried to take out his legs illegally..  I would have choked that  dude..too!    WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WE'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING TO THE END!!!|`|AA11097612	I agree with you to an extent.  What Harrison did was incredible.  I don't know why he wasn't thrown out of the ball game.  Fined?  Yes, he should and probably will be fined.  And like you I hope he is fined equal to his Super Bowl take.      Suspended?  Maybe for a few games but not half the season.  You're crazy if you think that is going to happen.      BTW, I'm a Steelers fan and was appalled by what happened.  You passion about this makes me think you are not a Steelers fan.  Too bad....  WE HAVE 6 NOW.  YOUR TEAM PROBABLY HAS NONE.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	Have they asked him what was said to him to make him go off??  I am sure what ever it was, it would have to be pretty bad.  Miss games, no.  Fined yes.  He should know better than to lose his cool like that.  But I am sure it wasnt uncalled for...|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Definitely needs to be fined... I also think at least a 2 game suspension would be a good punishment for the crime. A full season would be a bit over board... but I definitely feel Harrison needs to be fined and suspended... yes.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	NOWAY should be be fined. He didnt do anything wrong. over the top? maybe. he shouldnt of even been penalized. he was playing football and blocking. if you can push someone down to the ground without grabbing him then i would do it every play. when you play Pittsburgh, prepare to get your *** beat. Harrison will not be fined or suspended. your all idiots and wish you had harrison on your team. smashmouth footabll.|`|DymLS3Nyaa	NFL need to  fined.....I know if it was Nascar that's the first thing they do|`|AA10425091	sore loser|`|9Fq3jyykaa	I agree with you 100%. I still can not understand why he did that. Totally unsportsman like.|`|RSBBPYDWaa	The Steelers are the media darling, they had that game won before it started.....if you know what I mean. Everyone knows they're dirty......|`|4bc8ba55698a5aeaed5cdab5ca2f87b2aa	He is a steeler. His team just won the Super Bowl, Roger Goodell is not going to do anything. Yeah it was a stupid thing to do but he just got caught up in the emotion of the game. Thats what everyone at the NFL office is going to say. I am not saying what he did was acceptable.|`|iz6Don9qaa	yes! if you look at how the pitts didn't get flagged on the play..thats Bull Crap! and there where 2 other plays thay should have got the flag for and didnt..that would have put them back on the 40 or 45 yard line.with about 25 secs. left in the 4th. but yes suspend him! and take away his pay for that game! but hell its the pitts. we are talking about! ummmm what a dirty team! well i hope i don't make alot of people mad when i say this, but there is going to be alot of Brother & Sister marriage going on in Pa. cuz the steelers won the game! =)
13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	well, they did it this year with the leagues toughest schedule, and from what i've seen, next years schedule is a LOT easier, so who knows?  there's a chance, but it is really tough to do.  you never know what'll happen with injuries and whatnot.  but mike tomlin ain't no joke, and if anyone can do it, i know he can.|`|OFnVbxcAaa	No. The Giants will get Plaxico back and they will be unstoppable.|`|96b8aafea17899cd549fb0c224691b9faa	Yes they can and they will. They will defeat the Giants next year.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Been there, done that twice in the 70's.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	no  not good|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	they will win atleast 5 more in the next 8 years.  NOBODY will ever bet against them in the Super Bowl again, NOBODY.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes it is possible but some changes will have to be made on the team's offensive strategy because the Steelers can't keep playing scramble ball. Ben is going to get a serious injury and luck will only hold so long. Every team does it when needed but unfortunately the Steelers have gotten into a bad habit of doing it too often, imo. I support the team 100% but this is my constructive criticism.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	ya they can do it again. its not for sure but they still will have all the pieces and most of the same players through next year.|`|ihaCEikwaa	I think its possible--i hope so anyways! But like Mike Tomlin said "we are not defending nor repeating anything--we are just like any other team and have the same chances of any other team"     Go Steelers!|`|xRsiYmxPaa	it will be hard|`|DymLS3Nyaa	nope won't happen|`|8wmjYlfaaa	WHY DO YOU TYPE IN CAPS?!?!  and yes, probably.they have been good FOREVER.  they need to take a break.|`|jwQPWl5Haa	The Steelers can win back to back championships. They still have a young team that has the experience it takes to win big games, tight games and I seriously doubt Coach Tomlin will ease up on them next year the way Cowher did. I think they will be hungry to win it again next year.  Keep in mind, they went 12-4 with the toughest schedule and next year will be no different.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	Just like Barrack said, YES WE CAN.  Unlike what he said, no its not time for a change...LOL  Steelers can do it again, it is in there hands.|`|Tdzk4o5Iaa	All Depends on how well they Pay the reffs Next year.|`|yNrfKKjRaa	No because the damned Patriots will be back  :(|`|uRILt5txaa	YES! They can. They kick butt.|`|489d315755dd3d36b1b400515759a73caa	I doubt it -- because like every SuperBowl team that wins there will be some players who leave for another team just cause they are offered more money.  So to do back to back is going to be difficult for any team that wins it.|`|JKIWCgbUaa	hellllllllllllll no. the detroit lions will win super bowl 44! lions the next new dynasty|`|WgcT04JGaa	I believe they can, the only thing that the Steelers were really lacking in was the run game. I have been a Steeler fan for over 30 years and I can tell you that will not happen 2 years in a row. Mendenhall will be back next year and between he and Willie and whomever else they may pick up in the draft this will be corrected. The defense is staying together, the offense is staying together, all signs lead to them having another wonderful year so my guess is Yes, they will get a 7th ring. Heads high Steeler nation and wave those terrible towels we have done it again!!!!|`|jLOCqhckaa	It's in the realm of possibility. But with Tom Brady reemerging next year...it's a long shot. Along with the fact that the Dolphins and the Panthers becoming suddenly dominant teams after lackluster previous seasons. Who knows maybe the Lions can get the gears moving next season and win it all.lol funny stuff right there. As for the Boys...hell no until T.O. get your popcorn Owens is gone they should just kiss there chance goodbye. The Niners have a decent chance at making it to the big show before the Steelers do again next year.Why? The Steelers O-Line SSSSUUCCCCKKKKSSSSS!Until they improve and star protecting BigBen then no. Especially not in a league where Osi and Ware run wild.|`|C290wQWGaa	KEYSTONE BOWL NEXT YEAR

LnJjS8BRaa	Hapkido doesn't really have different styles. Any branches are really just someone trying to reinvent the wheel and take a little credit for themselves.<br>  <br>  Your kicking and striking might carry over into Hapkido but I promise you that you'll be making adjustments. In addition to any adjustments to striking method you'll be learning a lot of grappling, throws,joint locks and submissions which may be completely new to you. <br>  <br>  The biggest advantage you'll have from TKD is the fitness level and flexibility that you've gained through TKD training. Take that and start Hapkido like it's something new to you because it really should be. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pLsQdLl3aa	You are going to see a lot of the same types of foot and hand strikes. While you may know some counters to grabs, from my experience you guys typically prefer to escape and strike. We prefer to go full out joint manipulation to a lock followed by a take down or throw. Speaking of take downs and throws we have a large focus on those as well. I consider Hapkido a very well balanced art. Any specific questions feel free to send me an email. Link in my profile. Good luck man|`|lpU2dnqsaa	There are several styles of hapkido, but as some have said: They don't differ too much minus certain schools. Though some schools do go into groundfighting, and that may or may not be incorporated from a different style.<br>  <br>  There are some advantages to transitioning:<br>  - The striking is a little different, but you will know some of the fundamentals.<br>  - TKD and HKD are know to complement each other well. If you ever decide to blend both, over time you can learn which technique work for you in each style. For example: You may not like the defensive style kicks in Hapkido, but maybe you will, or maybe you like both styles of kicks and you'll do both. It will add to your repretoire.<br>  HKD is a great art to add the missing grappling piece of most Tae Kwon Do schools.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages<br>  - As I said, you will know the fundamentals of striking. How you use your strikes may take some time to adjust since Hapkido strikes are defensive, and used mainly to setup for grappling techniques. They will be similar often, but you may or may not run into some confusion.<br>  - Grappling techniques might be tough to learn.<br>  <br>  I personally think you should test the water before you decide whether or not you want to learn. I personally had no trouble transitioning from my mix of Boxing/Kickboxing/Tae Kwon Do to Hapkido/Kyukido.At that time I was taking Tae Kwon Do, but I switched to the latter school, and I learned some great grappling techniques!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|r5AMG8g7aa	There aren't really so much different styles of Hapkido. The problem is that some schools teach the real Hapkido, while others teach a watered down mass they are calling Hapkido. Then still other confuse the situation by calling what they do Combat Hapkido. Good Hapkido is just that. Bad Hapkido no matter what they call it is still juts bad Hapkido.
bGWcSAGCaa	On the upside, your bike should be in good, safe riding condition again.<br>  <br>  On the downside, for less than what you spent you could have purchased a decent chain tool and a few bike specific wrenches to do the work yourself.<br>  <br>  Pay the bill and mark it as a learning experience.  Acquiring the basic knowledge and skills to do basic repairs will prevent these financial surprises.<br>  <br>  "Challenging" the shop wouldn't be in your best interest, unless you've got a selection of better shops nearby and are willing to forego patronizing this particular shop in the future.  The fact that the bill is a few dollars higher than you expected doesn't mean it's worth the hostile business relationship.|`|VT1BSwFcaa	To sort out the brakes and fit the chain probably took him over an hour to do, you cant get much done these days for that sort of price, 27.50 an hour is OK.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	No this does not seem unreasonable at all. It was about an hours worth of work and your first problem is that you took your problem to them and what would you charge for someone using YOUR time? If you dont pay you wont get the bike back and if you already have your bike then they are trusting you to pay what you owe, trust is a two way street and you dont want to be ridding against traffic if you know what I mean...
UoT86gbiaa	Your OF is quite good (nice job getting Milledge and Maybin to fill that out), and A-Rod and Pedroia are - obviously - the anchors of your infield.  I don't care for your shortstop situation and you have too many players from the same team (Yankees).  Your starting pitching is well above average; although Dice-K is among the most overrated players in fantasy, the rest of your stable is solid.  In fact, you probably went a little too heavy on the SPs in the draft, which would explain why some of your hitters are sub-par.  You only have 2 closers, which is OK at the start of the season but you'll need more as time goes on.<br>  <br>  I'd give this a 7.  You can win with this team, but you'll need to address several needs over the course of the season.|`|zbQfEua9aa	9 it would have been a 10 if you didn't have Lastings Milledge or Cameron Maybin I have never heard of them. By the way I am drafting today and I get first pick any suggestions. just go to my profile My questions and answer.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|BcJN6YQOaa	7|`|92mVvHIuaa	about an 8 or 9|`|SEcM9EDZaa	To the guy who's never heard of Lastings Milledge or Cameron Maybin: You have no business trying to rate fantasy baseball teams.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I give you a 6.75.
qivUrJ3Naa	I like Pujols he's consistant.|`|DLevM7WDaa	I'm repaying the favor. If you mean fantasy, then take Hanley Ramirez. He is better than A-Roid is even though ESPN ranks A-Ro(i)d as better. Now because you have the 1st pick, you should have the last pick too. With this tell everyone you have the ultimate sleeper and to stick around to find out who it is. With this pick take Barry Bonds and everyone will crack up. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Also- if you want a real sleeper pick, take Jair Jurrjens with the 2nd to last pick. He's a fantastic player!!!|`|fUUlywctaa	It depends on how you look at it. A-Roid will most likely be the consensus number one pick, but I feel Ryan Howard will be hitting it out of the parks this year with a new contract. Hanley Ramirez, as previously mentioned, would also be a good choice. He won't put up the massive home run and RBI numbers as Howard, but he's a great play and fills the stat sheet.|`|t0bx27bVaa	Pujols<br>  <br>  Pujols has hit 35 HRs and 100 RBIs every season.  And he's 29.  He has 2 MVPs and a bunch of other positives.  I picked him at 1 in my league.|`|5kJHf9Hwaa	Ricky Henderson|`|HQdfS56daa	Albert Pujos! He won MVP with an injury. He is back and stronger than ever.
RuJYupFWaa	You really do just unscrew it.  But there's typically some red or blue loctite on the threads to keep it on there so it's pretty hard to remove.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure as Edge is a credible World champion and the storyliners worked a very innovative twist in the Elimination Chamber matches to book him as the WHC title winner.He's a very talented and charismatic wrestler who works an excellent style of wrestling and can put on exciting matches and cut entertaining promos.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B03fzis5PRs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B03fzis5P...</a>|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Nope.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	It wasn't fair, but if you look ahead after Monday night's Raw, you can see what is coming.  Having Cena retain the WHC would have put him in at WM25 against Orton, something they did not want to have as it is not that big of a draw.  With them putting Edge over as WHC after HHH won the WWE title for the 13th time (Remember, they are gearing him up for eventually passing Ric Flair's 16 title reigns..), it was the best way to make the Orton/McMahon storyline most interesting as now with Randy RKO'ing Steph, you have Hunter defending not only his title, but his wife's honor & the family-in-law's name.  Remember, Orton is gauranteed a title match at WM25, but it is not set that it has to be a certain title.  It is similar to the MIB stipulation, only without the anytime-you-choose part.  Also, Cena is gauranteed a re-match, so expect Cena/Edge & Orton/HHH in a double main event.  Now for somethng most people have not thought about..<br>  <br>  Keep this in mind.  Though Edge lost the WWE title & won the WHC, he is still contractually gauranteed a title rematch for the WWE title on Smackdown once he loses the WHC.  I would not be surprised if WM25 tended two title changes.  Cena/Edge will be the first match, maybe early in the ppv, expect Cena to regain his title to put him over, as his new movie "12 Rounds" is set to release in coming weeks.  Expect Orton to lose to HHH, but for Edge to use Vicki to reenact his rematch clause right after the match.  Thus, a rested Edge would regain his title from a worn down HHH.  Sound any similar to any other time Edge has won a title..??|`|AA12022123	i thinks its stupid how edge keeps winning the title and and nobodys complaining about him but everyone was complaing about john cena so yes i do think its "unfair"|`|dtpY4BEraa	i do he is sooo annoying he was so impatient that he couldnt wait for rematch with HHH to get belt back mind you it seems that HHH will be moving back to raw soon|`|T13xM9iJaa	Yes|`|nwNkXEO3aa	I dislike Edge to the core. It may be just a storyline of him winning the world heavyweight title. But I feel that he don't deserve to be even in the match. This storyline of him being the ultimate opportunitist is going bad already. So, if WWE sees this post, please, stop the storyline of him keep taking the chance to get what he wants.|`|3ExtDP45aa	Even though I love John Cena, i'm getting sick of the same people getting the title over and over again without any reason. <br>  <br>  When Jeff Hardy became champion it was nice to have a change.<br>  <br>  Edge must be doing something to get himself this many shots at the title, he must be sucking up bad to Vince!|`|lXp33SwSaa	Well, it certainly was controversial, and in my point of view wrong, but it was indeed fair as Vickie pointed out... "As Kofi was unable to compete, and that she was in charge", she put Edge in the match.. A decision that the officer-in-charge has a right to do...|`|2PCMiMJraa	it was totally fair, imaean he was a world champion and has the rights to a rematch for a world title, and that's what he got, another world title match.|`|8noUyvOZaa	He deserves it.

Yg1QR4mmaa	First of all, i do think that the U.S. has a greater history in boxing then the U.K. But guys like Sergey and another day same sh*t don't know anything about boxing. It is true that Roy Jones never fought outside the USA, I would respect him a lot more if he had fought guys like Nigel Benn instead of guys like Eric Lucas. It is funny how Roy Jones's lackluster string of victories gets swept under the rug. It is stupid how we Americans try to tear someone down when one of our guys can't beat him.|`|R0J1W3BCaa	The UK doesn't have very many great fighters. Only until recently have they even been able to compete with American and Hispanic boxers. I mean lets be serious how do you think a guy like Nigel Benn would have matched up with Tommy Hearns or Sugar Ray Robinson.<br>  <br>  Call me bias if you want but UK boxers have been getting smashed by Americans for years. Joe Calzaghe is one of the only guys to be some what successful.|`|5sHcB4wuaa	because Joe Calzaghe is really reaaaaaaaalllly boring to watch, so what if he can throw a crap load of punches a round, dude i fall asleep watching him fight, i wanna see some knockouts or broken jaws, this aint ballet, i dont mean no disrespect to UK fighters, its just Joe is really boring i dont like the way he fights|`|u3xmObC4aa	Sergey K  i agree with you 100% Joe aint nothing special.  And first of Uk elite boxers aint ******* with the U.S elite boxers. Hands down the U.S has more better and unique boxers than the U.K. We own boxing we have a life time history of great boxers unlike the U.K. And **** Joe cause since his been winning not to long ago he made a statement that boxing aint the same and that the sport is dying. He talking **** cause he havent got his *** whoo[p yet cause its coming trust me.|`|qoYLjfxvaa	??♂??ΜΣ?'s answer is great. I agree with what he said.<br>  <br>  Also, Hopkins, Toney, nor Jones had to prove themselves against British boxers. The Brits did not do have the resume nor the status to deserve a fight against the best of the Americans. A prime Roy Jones Jr. would have absolutely killed Calzaghe, and so would Hopkins.<br>  <br>  Nigel Benn's once stated that he was quite content at being ranked No.2 behind Roy Jones Jr.. That's respect.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	man is not just uk is whole europe!<br>  look how they call chad dawson great now and CHAD is so scared of fighting Diaconu that he makes me laugh lol<br>  what about Roy Jones never fought outside usa???:)<br>  man they scared|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	UK greats can't hold a candle to the American greats.<br>  <br>  And, yes, what happened to Gerarld McClellan did scare off American boxers from fighting in Engand.  You don't remember at the time because it wasn't a big deal for you, but on this side of the pond, American boxing was upset about the permissive nature of English boxing refereeing.  English fighters are allowed to lunge with their foreheads, and that was the very thing that got poor Gerald hurt.  Your English boxing has McClellan's blood on it's hands.  Benn did it to McClellan, and your Ricky Hatton made a career out of headbutting his opponents into submission.<br>  <br>  What you call legendary wars, we call  sloppy boxing foul-fests.  2 guys lunging head first into each other and swinging wildly is not boxing.  I remember Ricky Hatton fans crying about referee Joe Cortez enforcing the rules of boxing.  Hatton had nothing to offer Floyd Mayweather other than fouls.  And what Cortez couldn't stop, Floyd Mayweather nulified by letting Hatton heabutt into Floyd's forearm.<br>  <br>  So before you try to revel in your UK boxing culture, perhaps you should take a few moments to think about the blood of McClellan on your hands, and the sloppy, poorly officiated boxing that made it happen.  I'm sure you like it, but take a moment to think about the men who's lives are being destroyed so you can enjoy some slop in the ring.  English boxing is shambolic, really...and I'm not telling porkies.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	Neither Hopkins nor Calzaghe ever ventured from their weightclasses until the twilight of their careers, thats just a fact.  So in essence they both ducked anyone who didn't weigh 160 or 168 pounds - it doesn't matter what country they were from.  <br>  <br>  James Toney fought anyone, the only thing he refused to battle was weight issues.  He's going to retire with almost 90 fights...and he's been calling out the Klitschos for years.  <br>  <br>  Roy Jones didn't duck anyone, if you want to beat the WORLD champion you have to bend to their terms, period.  That is what Calzaghe has been preaching his whole career (even though no one acknowledged his "world" title).  <br>  <br>  The very simple fact of the matter is that taking on the fighters you are referring to would be nothing more than taking on European fighters for the sake of taking on European fighters - its stupid.

1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	LOL!  I'll let you know if I ever get there.<br>  <br>  True mastery of any art or method offers more than some impressive knowledge and a collection of fancy techniques.  Once you get to that point, the study of the art isn't about mastering the method.  It's about mastering yourself.  <br>  <br>  "Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead." <br>  --  Morihei Ueshiba, founder of Aikido|`|Vrd8gB61aa	u turn into a dragon...no<br>  <br>  it pretty much means that u have just turned another page in a book.<br>  <br>  Just keep moving on start to realize what is working for u and figure new things out|`|3DnX9NmAaa	...Old age.<br>  <br>  No martial art can be "mastered". If you mean when you receive your shodan, then the real training begins. You can never perfect it or learn every technique. It's a lifelong martial art and there is always more to learn. It's purpose, peace and self defense. What you get out of it, peace and self defense. Though many get more than that out of it. It just depends on the individual person and their individual experiences.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	Actually, you can get a sense of peace and calmness.  When you have the confidence of eing able to defend yourself in most situations, you can be at ease.  Please note, that, you can achieve this sensation with lots of training in most martial arts. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your journey.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	Shaman told you right.  I hope you may master your art, but I have yet to do so, as I have only been at it for 40 odd years.  Certainly not enough to master it!<br>    J|`|UHTcpdkVaa	You die, because you never master it while you are alive.  There is always something new to learn :-)|`|LnJjS8BRaa	There isn't anything mystical about martial arts.<br>  <br>  You do it because you love it, if you don't you don't stick with it your whole life and you don't come even close to mastering it.<br>  <br>  Mastery is technically impossible so we say it takes a life time. There is always something for you to learn or consider in a new way and this can be very rewarding for a practitioner who has dedicated themselves to their training.<br>  <br>  Short term returns include physical fitness, flexibility, socializing with like-minded students and self defense skills. As I've said, the long term is really for those that love the art and they aren't so much looking to get anything out of it; instead they just continue enjoying it.<br>  <br>  This applies to every martial art by the way, not just aikido.|`|LFLflsWFaa	You can never master the art, you can only master yourself.

You also slightly sink your weight down on your toe side turn, and slightly sit down on your heel side turn, either of these turns, when exaggerated will turn into a stop, which is where it becomes side slipping. But learn side slipping and falling leaf as well, so you can safely stop!|`|qqt0GTW8aa	Look in the direction you want to go.  Keep more weight on your front foot and lead with your knee in the direction of the turn.  Before you start your turn, start to twist your upper body in the direction you are turning with (Just a gentle twist).  Just before you start turning stand up a little bit straighter (unweighting) and when you are just past your turn bend your knees back to your original stance.<br>  It would be easier to show you than it is to type.<br>  I hope this make sense to you.|`|MFI0V2GBaa	Theres no way anyone can tell you online how to do things, it's impossible.<br>  <br>  Practice, Practice, Practice.<br>  Try lots of differnt techniques if one thing isnt working, don't try the same thing over and over if it isn't working cause its going to get you no where.|`|jTaW3goeaa	practice.

What do you think??<br>  NASCAR doesn't retire numbers because a driver is killed, if they did they would run out of numbers in a while..|`|7RUMbREoaa	No because Richard Childress buys the rights to use that number every year and if he felt like someone(it would probably be his grandson,Austin Dillon) was deserving of that number then I would respect his decision as he and Earnhardt were great friends and he would never do anything to disrespect him.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	It is generally believed that current NASCAR owners have agreed never to use the #3 in Sprint Cup competition again, although this is not official NASCAR policy.<br>  <br>  Only the former International Race of Champions has actually retired the #3, which they did in a rule change effective in 2004.

LUnscegvaa	I like both as I'm a Fedor fan.<br>  <br>  But UFC is still more popular but I'll say Affliction.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Affliction has some great fighters. I don't think their talent is UFC deep though! Probably very far from it.<br>  <br>   They have the best Heavyweight in the world in Fedor, but after him and Arlovski the talent pool dries up very quickly...<br>  <br>  In the light heavyweight division they grabbed babalu who in my opinion is a top 15-20 guy in the world.. They may also grab Ortiz who probably should have a win against the current UFC champ. They have some other contenders but again the talent is not very deep.<br>  <br>   The most intriguing guy to me is the reemergence of Vitor Belfort! the guy is really looking good at 185 lbs. I would love to see him go against Anderson Silva because overall he matches up really good on paper.. But besides him and lindland again the talent pool is very shallow. <br>  <br>    I wish them the best. Hopefully they will continue putting up go shows. they will probably tank though because honestly the UFC just has too much power and they are very greedy.<br>  <br>     *edit.. and yeah I do agree that the UFC purposely tried to do a free show at the same time. They have done that not only with Affliction but other companies too! They even put Anderson Silva at light heavyweight to try to take away PPV's!  Even though most companies are not a big threat right now to the UFC. I think they are just being careful|`|nRBC4E5saa	In every way but the quality of their Heavyweight division, the UFC is better.  Better production, better commentators, better overall roster of fighters, better press, more frequent events, and so on.<br>  <br>  The ring vs. cage thing is a personal preference.  I don't mind seeing fights in the ring, in fact I think it's a far more traditional setting, but after seeing the first Affliction event and seeing Babalu almost drop his opponent on the concrete, twice, I have no doubt that the cage is safer for the fighters overall.<br>  <br>  I don't think the UFC started to offer free events because of Affliction.  Mostly because Affliction has had two shows and the UFC has had around two dozen free events, which started back in 2005/2006.<br>  <br>  I hope that Affliction is successful.  I bout their first PPV and would have bought their second if I had the money.  I like the fact that they co-promote, and their use of the ring hopefully throws off the steriotype that MMA is "cage fighting".  But at this point they basically have six fighters or so that are worth watching.  Their roster is far too thin at this point to sustain growth.  In fact if Fedor was in the UFC, or anywhere else for that matter, we probably wouldn't even be talking about Affliction.|`|1oNi2v38aa	UFC has a bigger talent pool and can put on more shows per year. Affliction is basically trying to revolve around Fedor. Even if they put on great shows, it will be infrequent. But the UFC puts on shows every month year round which keeps me interested. Fight Nights also allows the audience to see new fighters.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	Dana White is not making it free because of Affliction<br>  he just likes to give back to the people<br>  because they pay for all the other UFC fights, most of them on pay per view.<br>  Don't forget UFC,WEC, PRIDE are all owned together so its  big. <br>  <br>  People from the UFC compete in Affliction too|`|9NDL5YQJaa	I enjoyed the 2 Affliction events.  Problem is they are spending way too much money.  Elite XC and the IFL went under b/c they spent too much.  <br>  <br>  Overall, Affliction has talent in the HW division, but won't be a threat to the UFC.|`|LaBxzWa7aa	I like Affliction better because of the ring, but if you're speaking of caliber of fighters, the UFC easily outranks Affliction by far.<br>  <br>  The only division Affliction has bragging rights over the UFC is the Heavy Weight Division, and it's mainly because of Fedor.<br>  <br>  Other than heavy weights, Affliction's small roster of elite fighters include: Little Nogueira, Matt Lindland, Vitor Belfort and Babalu.<br>  <br>  Basically Affliction is made up of fighters that have contract disputes with the UFC and fighters that were kicked out of the UFC because they were on losing streaks.<br>  <br>  But yes, the heavy weight division of Affliction is pretty amazing, even though we don't see any good match-ups besides the fighters that fight Fedor.<br>  <br>  Boasting Fedor, Barnett, Arlovski and Sylvia gives an organization huge props.<br>  <br>  Plus Affliction will most likely show a Filipovic match-up if he gets back into his game.|`|5TIX6PH3aa	Dana White didn't introduce free events to counter Affliction.  He introduced free events dating back to April of 2005 when The Ultimate Fighter Finale was free.  Then he created the Ultimate Fight Night idea to introduce the world to up-and-coming fighters in the UFC (primarily the TUF fighters).  In October of 2006, the UFC held The Final Chapter which was the 3rd fight between Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock for free on Spike because fans thought the fight at UFC61 was stopped early.  At the time it was the most watched MMA event in US history.  Then when the UFC started to try to hold events overseas, they offered those events free here in the US.  Affliction didn't even hold an event until July of 2008.<br>  <br>  Affliction isn't in the same league as the UFC.  Who is their LW champ, WW champ, MW champ, LHW champ, or even HW champ?  They don't have one (WAMMA recognizes Fedor as the HW champ not Affliction).  Who are their young and upcoming stars?  They don't have any.  How many of the fighters that Affliction has are actually ranked in their weight class?  Maybe 4.  On the Affliction's last card, besides the Fedor/Arlovski fight, do you really think any of those fights would be on a UFC main card?  Most of the fighters in Affliction are fighters that were with the UFC and were released including Barnett, Lindland, Belfort, Heiron, Buentello, Sokoudjou, Matyushenko, and Lauzon.<br>  <br>  I like watching all MMA including Affliction but it will never be real competition to the UFC.  They have an unsustainabile business practice (overpaid fighters to the point they can't make money) and there are already rumors that they will never hold another show.  I hope it isn't true but I wouldn't be surprised.  Enjoy the fights but watch them knowing what they are.|`|01cIxqiAaa	The last PPV was very good in my opinion, but it was good because it was sub-par talent vs. sup-par talent until the main event which kept fights close.  Don't get me wrong, I was entertained and I will probably buy the next one, unless it within weeks of a loaded UFC card.  I only got this one because I thought the UFC didn't take them seriously and didn't put together a good card to compete the week before.<br>  <br>  If Dana was going to set up a free PPV to counter Affliction, he would do it the night of an Affliction PPV.  It makes no sense to say he did, when Affliction isn't even fighting this month, or even next month.  UFC does this because believe it or not, every once and awhile they give something back to the fans. Sometimes it's not much, but other times you get decent cards. They've been doing this awhile, well before Affliction came to town.<br>  <br>  Affliction is not trying to compete with the UFC, they've said it outright. They are just trying to get in the fight game and put on good fights, and they do. But they have a long way to go before you can say compete, they aren't even the #2 fight company in the world right now.<br>  They're a good company but a realistic company as well.<br>  <br>  Oh and whose the guy that said UFC fighters fight in Affliction too. Um, that's wrong UFC fighters have contracts and can't fight anywhere else.  The guys you're thinking about are released UFC fighter (i.e. ex-UFC fighters).|`|fWWHMDWQaa	I got to say I just bought Affliction to check out Fedor but I was really surprised by how great a card they had. I that it was on and bought it and watched it like half an hour later not expecting much. It was great though. Fedor's overhand right or right hook or what ever that was knock out was just the perfect end to a great card. Honestly though if the Ufc got Fedor it would be no contest<br>  <br>  According to Dana white he use to watch free Tuesday night boxing or something and that's why he likes to give free shows|`|s4qOgi19aa	UFC, better figher pool, better presentation and more fights.<br>  Affliction ain't bad for a cool 2nd place though!<br>  Without Fedor Affliction is just the ex- UFC!|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	I like Affliction also. The Fedor fight was really good.<br>  <br>  I even like the Affliction Clothing , but it's very expensive.<br>  <br>  But I just think that UFC is more popular|`|5KjvNg2oaa	yea because ufc never had a free event until affliction came around|`|c73AAq22aa	depend which your in too
wurimjbnaa	I think you could blame the whole team for your performance, you couldn't score or keep a clean sheet.|`|TKDi70uTaa	the whole thing was a shambles. i agree the defenders should have came but what annoyed me about gomes was his ptetending to be hurt again. i dont think he wants to play at all and his overacting is a way of looking to hide. also agree that bent should have played from the start. the only bright spot was parret who for a 17 year old showed all the other midlielders what they should be doing. its just another embarassing, sickening game for the fans. we have had so many.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	i told you ! Spurs will get battered ! poor Tottenscum.|`|tfotPdeZaa	Yeah.. Defense was bad last night, and the Ukrainians definitely took advantage of it. But i think Gomes does have to partially take the blame, not fully, but some of it IS his fault. I think Cudicini would have been able to stop it. As for blaming Redknapp, he really didn't care about the game. He wants everyone to be fresh for the Hull game.. We better score at least 2 at the lane :) Idk.. sigh. Also disappointed. :(|`|7Xridrxaaa	Haha Spurs defense fell asleep. Either that or they were doing a semi offside trap there haha but Gomes is to blame as well. More than the defense in my opinion|`|rfCGWFNcaa	gomes is shite simple as......redknapp is getting on my t!ts...the bloke aint got a bloody clue|`|YItnjR6Zaa	Rednap never intended to win the game so blame him, he said he wanted to rest his players for the crucial hull game. I am sick of people blaming gomez, he is a good goalkeeper with a terrible defence, of course teams are going to score against him if there is a crap defence.|`|hfQnUqnVaa	Despite the poor defending for the 2 goals, Gomes wasnt playing at his best and hasnt been for a long time.<br>  Most of the time the defenders had it covered, so the blame has to go to Gomes.<br>  He's the guy who's being payed to save goals, which he hasn't been doing.<br>  sorry Gomes's fault!|`|fwcuyh37aa	gomes' fault
VRdxwKaQaa	No matter what parents, kids, and coaches say, most 8 year olds are clumsy, forgetful and short on attention spans. So those boys with more experience are not all that much further along than your son. Your son might need to have other forms of coaching that you can provide such as visual supports or verbal cues to remind him of what to do. Otherwise, let him have fun for as long as he can. If you were to hold him out, he would fall further behind the learning curve and it would be that much more competative later on.|`|sfqwon7haa	There is baseball for these types of children.  It is called Challengers baseball.  See if there is something similar in his area.  At 8 the disabilites may not be as noticeable, but he will soon have a hard time keeping up athletically with the boys his age.|`|v0MlomPoaa	Without knowing the severity of your son's issues, it's difficult to know what the right thing for him would be. <br>  <br>  As mentioned here already there are leagues designed for physically and mentally chanllenged kids.<br>  There is the Miracle Leage;<br>  <a href="http://www.miracleleague.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miracleleague.com/</a> <br>  and the Little League Challenger division<br>  <a href="http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/divisions/challenger.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/A...</a> <br>  <br>  You may want to look into those before deciding, or if the current situation doesn't seem to work.<br>  <br>  If you think your son is both physically capable of playing, and mentally able to understand what is being taught and to learn, you might give the regular league a chance.<br>  <br>  There will likely be a wide range of ability amongst the other kids on the team and in the league.  Some will be very good and it may be competive in the league.<br>  <br>  I do think it is a good idea to discuss the matter with the coach.  If he is a good coach, he will be honest with you about the kids in the league and what challenges you would face.  You can probably get an idea about his own comfort level having your son on his team.<br>  <br>  I had one child that had some sort of mental challenge on my team one season, but no physical issues.  He ws 8 at the time.  He struggled to hit the ball and despite the team and coaches encouraging him, he became more frustrated as the season went on and simply didn't want to be there by then end of the season.  I had the feeling it was his father forcing him to play to assimilate with other kids his age.  The only real problem I had with him, is that he almost never came to practices, only games, so he didn't have much chance to improve.<br>  <br>  If he enjoys playing, I think it comes down to your son's ability and then the coach and team's acceptance.  If he's having fun and putting forth effort, and the coach and team have the character to support him, it could be a great thing for your son and the team/league as well.|`|h074DM42aa	Hey, go for it.  Patience is the key at the level.  The coaches should be teaching the kids some basic skills (throwing, catching, swinging), along with how to chew bubble gum and blow bubbles (that stick to your face), pick grass off the infield, and just talkin' to the batter (Hey batta, batta, batta).<br>  <br>  As for Little League, maybe look at a recreational league, that isn't so competitive for him, or the other kids.<br>  <br>  I think the focus of baseball has been lost, so I am biased in that I think it still should be fun, even if you aren't very good!   There is nothing like hitting the ball the first time all season and just grounding out.  If the parents of the team understand, really understand, what just happened with the kid that does it, it will mean more than any home run in any World Series.  And I personally know a Major League superstar that will tell you the same.  (Can you say, King Albert!  His own son is special needs.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, just get him out there and be with him while he does it.  Don't sit idly by while the coach tries to corral all of the kids--be a helper, retrieve balls, throw catch with the odd-kit-out, lug the batbag, or scribe the baselines.  Your child will think more of the game if you are involved.<br>  <br>  And despite the current actions of some major league players to juice, I think the game is salvagable for our kids.<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts!<br>  <br>  PLAY BALL!!!!

And they can do it without Bynum but he will be back for the playoffs.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Bynum is expected to return to the Lakers during March, but I still don't think they are going to win the championship because I have a strong feeling that Kobe is going to get injured in March. Also, even that dosen't happen there still not going to win because there are alot of contending teams in the West the Lakers will probably get eliminated in the Western SemiFinals or the Western Championships.|`|5Fq178afaa	no they might not even make the finals san antonio might beat them. But as for one of the comments yes they beat the celtics without bynum but bynum doesn't matter and i dont care what gasol and oden do during the regular season they are still soft. The celtics could still acquire starberry and joe smith with those guys the will win out the bigger question is how long kg is out for. nobody should care about bynum two big injuries in two years hes injury prone. If you go by player to player the celtics will have the better team if they dont get marbury or smith kg is alot better than gasol oden cant do anything pierce cant be guarded unless kobe goes on him allen who's going to cover him luke walton or fisher. everyone is saying the celtics havent improved but i think that they did with Pruitt and rondo improving alot and big baby has a jumper watch out lakers and kg fouled out of that game to so that helps to.

34XCm07vaa	thees ees a stupet question, gringo.<br>  <br>  makes no sense, chamaco.
JKIWCgbUaa	You have the size to play multiple postions, on both offense and defense. It all comes down to what you really have the drive to play and the desire to play. Looking at your info, if you are 6 ft 198 lbs run fast and hit hard then i think you should be playing defense. A linebacker/safety position something like that. If you want to play offense or have a better chance of playing offense at Northen Illinois (Great School, and Great Program) then you should try out at Wide reciever. If you have good hands then wide out is a good postion for you to play. Im sure you are lifting hard and working out now. I think you need to gain some weight to play running back, but that is certainly possible. Good luck trying to make the team. I hope this helped.|`|AOA8TJraaa	WR|`|qvuQSQvpaa	DB|`|op4fEbEVaa	CB RB or WR,|`|CK8TQkX9aa	definitely a skill position player. Its hard to say though without knowing your combine numbers out of high school. my guess is you lifted weights to lose that weight so your pretty strong. Your about the size of a Bob Sanders when he was at Iowa, if that's the case I would try strong safety. your just a bit short and underweight to be a LB but coaches will know if you can be like a Zach Thomas and still play the position because of your strength and natural ability. Plus, Brian Urlacher played Safety at New Mexico and ended up as one of the best LBs ever. I would just play it safe NIU being a D1 school and all.<br>  <br>  go out for Strong Safety.|`|bJn83u7Oaa	Probably safety or Corner back, depending on your speed.  Safeties don't need to be as fast as a corner.  You could also be a wide receiver if you have solid hands.|`|p3tVyimaaa	Kicker or punter.|`|03e2eef23ca4f2b1d0c6c2d1b2f77e9daa	perfect size for a safety|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	You have ideal WR/CB/S size, although you might be a bit light for running back, you have the general size for that as well.<br>  <br>  However, if your speed is not measurably elite, since "fast" is relative, you are going to be limited by your size.  Unless you have sub 4.55 speed, you might as well start bulking up for linebacker.|`|lNytOKH5aa	6ft 198 lbs thats about a wr but if you gain about 20 lbs your about a rb

They still need to do alot of work though.<br>  <br>  Go Pistons!|`|oAsmgOCeaa	No team should EVER tank a season.  Losing on purpose is for losing franchises.

I think come playoff time they will also be a different team.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	well they are defenitely not going to beat Boston, Cleveland, Orlando, or Atlanta in the playoffs if they meet them so honestly I think that Iverson or Prince should just pull a Dwayne Wade and say your injured and sit out the rest of the year.

NvaK57Phaa	well, i'd hate to say it, but there's really not much you can do to work on your throwing arm before Wednesday. there's just not enough time. the best interest in mind is that you should probably just take the initiative and tell him that you are not a very good QB. if he is a good coach, he will be understanding and either tell you to focus on another position or he will work with you throughout the season. but don't be nervous to approach him and tell him that you are not that good at QB. if you think about it, the results of him finding out that you aren't that good at QB from you telling him will be smoother than you going out there and messing up big time. also, the coach may admire you for your honesty. <br>  <br>  also, it may help if you imagine if you were the coach and you said that to a kid, unknowing that he couldn't throw. would you rather the kid tell you himself, or would you rather find out on the field? good luck!|`|7sVg9NPxaa	ask Dr. Phil|`|8c5dfb8ff876deaaa25ab74d326f84a7aa	They almost NEVER throw the football in freshman Football. Your good. Chances are, if you are chosen to be QB then they are planning on coaching you up to the position. Alums decide who starts at QB in High School not talent scouts.  Make sure you tell your dad thanks for writing out a nice check to the school.|`|sU60NqWWaa	Why does the coach want you to be starting QB if you can't throw the ball?

Now why would he do that if he never saw you play?
Jbsawmr9aa	West - Jazz<br>  East - Heat<br>  <br>  The Jazz are gonna get healthy.  It's interesting to think that when it comes to trade deadline, and post deadline.  The Jazz are the team that is going to improve the most, and they didn't even make a trade.  The fact that they are going to come back healthy is huge.  Kirilenko improves their defense by a lot and having Boozer back will provide that go to guy in the offense.<br>  <br>  The Heat made some interesting trades and now have a legitimate post presence on both defense and offense.  This will take some of the pressure off DWade and should help open up the perimeter players like Cook and Chalmers.  The Heat should improve their 3 point performance and I think they will go on a streak.  Also their schedule favors them.|`|GoYT6SIHaa	West-Utah Jazz<br>  East-Hawks|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	West-Nuggets<br>  <br>  East-Pistons|`|2370f62875bd70c8746709dffc08ef47aa	west: da jazz<br>  east: da bulls|`|IBn7kGSMaa	West: Nuggets<br>  East: The only real answer to this is the Pistons|`|L0ft1eo7aa	west nuggets <br>  <br>  East  Detroit|`|eF60R7DPaa	KNICKS|`|21J0IIZbaa	West: Nuggets<br>  East: Heat|`|GswnLKtQaa	West - Suns<br>  East - Pistons|`|dDhTMacAaa	Western Conference - Well, I had a high hope come by for Phoenix, but losing Amare for 8 weeks could be disastorous. And I like your Denver pick, but my prediction for a sleeper is a team that was supposed to be right next to the Lakers right now, the New Orleans Hornets. Led by an MVP candidate (unlikely, but still one) in Chris Paul, they have underachieved but still have a lot of pieces, and good ones, that could be key assets in the post-season.<br>  <br>  Eastern Conference - Funny to be calling them a sleeper, but assuming this team comes together, the Detroit Pistons are my selection here. They are currently the #7 seed and a dismal 27-26, but do you think a high seed wants to draw Detroit in the playoffs? They still have Iverson, 'Sheed, and Rip, plus a solid supportind cast.

19e105ab5db2630045e3c2bbc4136e25aa	Look at the quality of the races and tracks that the horses have been racing in.  Graded stakes are better than ungraded stakes, named stakes are better than allowance races, allowance races are better than claimers, 50k claimers are better than 20k claimers, etc.  Likewise, races at Belmont tend to be tougher than at Finger Lakes (unless the later is a stakes...and maybe even then), Santa Anita is tougher than Turf Paradise or Fairplex, and so on.

rv6zl5t3aa	It's a possibility, but not likely. Right now he has 131 career wins and would have to avg. 17wins for 10 years which would bring him to 42 years old. So barring any injuries and declining because of age, it's possible, but not likely.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Unless there is some change in the way starters are currently used, no one will be able to do it under 35. As it is, anyone doing it at all will be most difficult. Things MIGHT change, though. You never know.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	I'll say C.C. Sabathia.  He's 28 years old and has 117 wins so if he can average 14 per season until he's 40 he'll have 300.  So far in his career he's average 14.625 wins per year.  <br>  <br>  He signed with the Yankees for 7 years so if he can average 17 wins a year for New York that will give him 236 wins at the age of 35.  If he does that then he should make 300 with no problem.<br>  <br>  edit: He's not asking who will win 300 games by the age of 35.  He's asking which pitcher, who is currently under 35, will win 300 games in their career.  Without the "under 35" stipulation then the answer would obviously be Randy Johnson.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Before I even clicked your question to read the details, the only name that came to mind was Roy Halladay.  Weird.<br>  <br>  Anyway, like everyone else has said even he is an extreme long-shot at getting to 300 wins.  Statistically, Roy Oswalt is the next closest to Halladay in Ws and he's about the same age (both are ~31).  He might be the only other guy in the conversation at this point.<br>  <br>  If Randy Johnson doesn't get 5 more wins to get to 300, I think it's going to be a very very long time until anyone else gets 300 wins in MLB.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Halladay has 131 wins at age 31, but Sabathia has 117 wins at 28.  He's on a better pace to do so, but there are weight issues there<br>  <br>  Zambrano has 96 wins and is 27, <br>  Jake Peavy has 86 wins and is 27<br>  Both Kazmir and Verlander are also very young, 24 and 25.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	Roy Oswalt 30 years old and 129 wins<br>  <br>  C.C. Sabatha- 28 years old and 117 wins.<br>  <br>  Josh Beckett- 28 years old and 89 wins<br>  <br>  Brandon Webb 29 years old and 87 wins<br>  <br>  Scott Kazmir 24 years old and 47 wins.<br>  <br>  I would say that C.C. has the best chance.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Halladay will only have a shot if he leaves the Blue Jays and spends some serious time with a contender.<br>  I'm not sure that there is a guy who will get to 300 under the age of 35.  It's hard to get that far that fast in today's game.  How old is Brandon Webb?  Maybe he'll have a shot at it.|`|J048Slgbaa	I don't think it will happen for a very long time.  Pitchers aren't used the way they used to be.  With so much time before starts you may never see it again.  Not only that but so many young arms go through years in the minors before they are called up so the avg rookie pitcher is probably in the mid 20's so that doesn't give them a lot of time to hit that number.  <br>  Halladay has as good a shot as any..maybe Webb and I'd like to throw Peavy's name out there too if he wasn't playing for such a terrible team.  <br>  <br>  CC Sabathia has a great shot.  He has around 120 wins and is only 28.  Usually big legged power pitchers stay in the game the longest so he is probably the one guy who can do it.<br>  <br>  Santana is only 30 but is already having arm problems so he won't make it that far.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	Possibilities  C C Sabathia, Johan Santana, Brandon Webb.  I think all three have a better chance than Roy Halladay (who plays for the Blue Jays)<br>  I don't know why so many people are saying Halladay.  Since when is he going to win every single game, and then some, of the next four seasons?  <br>  In any case.  I think it's impossible for this generation|`|CshFQShGaa	No one will ever win 300 by the age of 35, at least not in our lifetime. Pitchers only get about 30-32 starts a year, if they are healthy all year, and since the age of the complete game is long past, they get too many no-decisions to consistently win the 22-25 games a year that it would take to get there.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I agree with you Roy Halladay can but this will be a very rare feat in sports history. I say there is a 1% chance this will happen. He already has 131 wins and 66 losses and he is already 31. He only has 4 years to accomplish this milestone.

1yuUIN9Aaa	They probably do talk to each other, but when a game is going on I don't think that's the right time to talk and anyways Oki's in the bullpen when Dice-K is waiting to pitch. The cameramen just don't barge into the locker rooms either.

DrGU9o96aa	bowling power play= when a captain of a side feels like their team is on top of the game then he will make a decision to take a quick 5 over power play which is 5 overs bowled by 2 bowlers in the spell, only 2 players of the 11 are allowed to field outside the center ring, the rest must be fielding inside the center ring, the umpire will signal to the third umpire that the captain has decided to take their bowling power play, in that time there might be a few wickets lost in momentum of the bowling team or their could be heaps of runs scored from the momentum of the batting side    batting power play= exactly the same as a bowling power play but they will only take the power play if they feel like they need it, this could make a difference to the score which the batters are trying to chase down or set , the power play is like a handicap to a side needing either quick wickets or quick runs.|`|AA11088802	when batting side take power play is called batting power play and when bowling side take power play is called bowlting power play|`|bettx8AYaa	it is wen you use your bat to powerplay your balls.

Last time I checked, the Super Bowl had about 54 per cent of the vote.    I'd say that seems about right.  The Super Bowl is more likely to attract non-football fans who go out to parties just to watch the ads.  Then again, CTV blocked all US ads this year, even for people with digital cable who had access to more than one NBC station.  The only way to see the American ads was with a satellite dish...|`|Lw9yYvS9aa	i dont even KNOW what the grey cup is lmao|`|MSiYrhC4aa	of course not i never even heard of the grey cup

Oh and when I am criticized for answering with actual football data haha|`|uXXbegw5aa	Ahhh God I hate when people say "your not intrested in football, you only like it for the players"..

Not most of the women on here. 90% of the women here are biased and blind. All they do is hate on every club but the one major one that they root for. They just rant on and on about how teams like: Barcelona, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Argentina MNT, Spain MNT, Mexico and Brazil MNT are the best and how nothing can compare to them. And then they rant on and on about how teams like: Manchester United, Real Madrid, Fulham, Westham United, Inter Milan, Tottenham, Villareal, Roma, all the MLS teams, USA MNT, England MNT, Germany MNT, and the Italian MNT suck and how their players are gay and they dive. <br>  <br>  But don't make me out to be some sexist... you know it's true.|`|vHggsiJvaa	we dont know activally how inocent you girls are.

gUMucKOkaa	The CEO always makes more than the employees. And he should.|`|c6q3EERdaa	It is a little ridiculous. I think the MLB needs a new commish. He has outstayed his welcome. Bud should've done something about the steroid issue far sooner than he did, and there is no way that the 2002 All Star Game should've ended in a tie. Also, home field in the World Series should not depend on the winner of the ASG.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	I think a lot of the money the players make are ridicolous.  I mean, Manny, today, rejected 25 million dollars, for ONE YEAR. That's a buttload of money.  I mean, there's people surviving off 25,000 a year and he's going to deny 25 million a year?  Wowwwwwwww talk about spoiled!      So overpaid?  Yes, he is.|`|80OPj9gGaa	Yeah he's overpaid. Especially because he suuuucks.    Thanks for letting steroids in and not doing SH!T about it!!!!!|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Sure, Selig makes much more than he would have as an owner, but it's only because he's prostituted the sport to get there--by letting the steroids problem get way out of control in order to make a buck--only to blame the players in the aftermath.  Selig is a feckless punk and one of the worst commissioners in MLB history. The sad thing is that because he is a former owner the position, as well as the wealth and fame it entails, will be his for life or until he no longer wants it. Unless, of course, owners take a hit to their bank accounts which could very well happen given the current state of the economy and the fact that a certain team is driving salaries up across the board.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	On one hand he's paid a lot, but on the other the MLB has enjoyed recorded profits and popularity under him.  How much are those increased profits worth?  $17 million?|`|2pOMWZtKaa	Yes.  Bud Selig is not just a terrible commissioner, he was a horrible owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and generally a baffoon who belongs selling used cars as he did before buying the Brewers.      I was in the front row 3rd base side when the Brewers retired Paul Molitor's number.  Bud was sitting on the make-shift stage and didn't listen to a word of Paul's speech.  Instead, he was waving to friends in the first few rows and talking to those sitting near him.  He has absolutely no class.  Oh yeah, and thanks for ruining an all-star game you idiot.

I want to blame Michael Vick.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	No, it is comcasts fault.  They showed 10 seconds of p0rn during there game and that messed up there fans.  That is why they lost.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Cardinals need to look in the mirror to see who to blame.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	No the Cardinals can't blame Brett Favre|`|BD7yd8D4aa	The Cards have no one except themselves to blame. Warner threw the bad pick at the end of the first half.    If they are going to blame others the refs seemed to do everything possible to give the game to Pittsburgh. Both Arizona challenges were overturned.    If you can't count on your defense to make a stop late in the game then you don't deserve to win.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	LOL ok, I've gotta give you props. I didn't really think you could make that connection.    Here's one for you, though: If your Patriots hadn't lost to (guess who?) Brett Favre and the Jets, it would have been the Patriots and Dolphins in the playoffs, and the Ravens out. Same situation.    So, shouldn't the Cardinals fans blame the Patriots defense for their Super Bowl loss? ;-)|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No. They should blame Kurt Warner for not seeing Harrison on the pick that he took 100 yards to the house... 14 point swing right there...     -or-     They should blame the entire Cardinals secondary for letting Holmes torch them for 70+ yards and the game winning touchdown on Pittsburghs game clinching drive.    -or-     They should blame their defensive coordinator for not blitzing on that same game winning drive.     -or-     They should blame the RT, who was responsible for blocking Harrison, for having so many holding penalties... did he set a Superbowl record for holds or what? Maybe we should look it up...|`|7sVg9NPxaa	I actually think it was George Bush's fault. If he hadn't ... .|`|bWirSb8Paa	no!!!|`|0WPdeB4Paa	IF a frog could fly, he wouldn't bust his butt jumping.  The "what ifs" are meaningless.  The officiating looked suspect, but in the end, the Cards had the opportunity to win the game and didn't.|`|S8qzG9HMaa	or they could just take responsibility for thier loss|`|batKa7kYaa	i wanna play this game too it seems like fun. I think they should blame Michael Vick too. If he wouldve never did the whole dogfighting thing, the Falcons wouldve never drafted Matt Ryan who wouldve then fell to the Ravens who wouldve then taken the best quarterback in the draft. Then the ravens wouldve beaten the steelers all three times they played and the steelers wouldve never made the playoffs and the cardinals wouldve played the ravens and gotten beaten up by their defense and then we would be playin this game and blamin the steelers for the cardinals loss to the ravens instead. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!|`|a6EndAPiaa	Why shouldn't the Cardinal's fans blame Farve.  They are blaming everyone else:    The NFL for rigging the game  Vegas for the point spread  The refs because they had money on the game  the steelers for paying off the refs    So like I said why not blame Favre as well?|`|qfVE2KFtaa	I blame the Cowboys I don't know why I just do.|`|Qz3sii2caa	It's George W.Bush's fault!|`|M5ykrN4Laa	Ok your really retarded...you went too far with the ravens deal, that couldnt have been a better game for anyone else...jeeze people just don't know what they are talking about
Tdzk4o5Iaa	There was talk about it, but it was the Eagles Fans like myself were talking about on Yahoo Answers and stuff, and the Cards Fans were saying ahhh stop using it as an excuse, and saying you lost, blah blah blah!!  Well what comes around goes around, they got the bad call in the Super Bowl,( One on the fumble at the end of the game, and now they are just like us, SO SHUT UP CARDS FANS YOU DIDNT DESERVE TO BE THERE.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	You are exactly right, but good luck getting any Cards fans to admit it....|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Your right about that! Why aren't the cards fans boo-hooing about that! The Eagles got cheated big time!|`|zFNOaDAYaa	THESE ARE EXCUSES (AND WHINING) THAT FANS MAKE TO JUSTIFY THEIR TEAM LOSING . WE WILL HEAR IT IN EVERY GAME . ESPECIALLY THE IMPORTANT ONES. SOME OF US JUST DEAL WITH IT BETTER THAN OTHERS.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Where were you? There was plenty of talk about the non-call on Roderick Hood.     The refs did a fine job in the Superbowl... the only thing I'm a little surprised by is that there was no review on the Warner fumble.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I didn't cry when the Chargers molested Freeney all day|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Agreed.|`|p4H61jQDaa	the eagles have always been on the the short end of officiating, it was clearly holding + passing interference when he tripped curtis. Also most of the media love to hate on mcnabb and will take away anything from him, if that was kurt warner who lost on that play there would be a national up roar.|`|jwQPWl5Haa	There is a lot of Steeler haters out there that are crying because they won. They have to blame the refs because then they don't have to admit they the Steelers were the better team. Ditto for SB40.    No matter though, the Steelers are the Champions!    PS. To all the crybabies, you are really taking away from a great game by all of your belly aching!|`|2CuuIT70aa	Nobody cares when its Philly fans who get screwed.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	I AGREE 100%!!!!!!!!!!

Players will be lining up at Al's door because he will pay the big bucks to win a super bowl. And there will be many Al Davis fans. That's why Al is spending buck now, because after 2009 season it won't matter how much they have spent over the last coupe of years.  Why do you think Nnamdi and Shane signed, because they want to be apart of it. AL said he wanted 2 more rings before he  go's out and he will pay the price to get them.

6KZgeq3Maa	B/c Woodley was still talented enough to make the play anyway.  Maybe they would have called it if Warner did not fumble.    Tony- Buy or sell- I think you may mean Harrison when you mention a lineman getting pounded into the ground.  I don't recall Woodley doing anything like that.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	The fact that holding happens on just about every play and is highly subjective.|`|a6EndAPiaa	The guys on the NFL Network post game show mentioned. it.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	How come an excessive celebration penalty wasn't called on Santonio Holmes on the game winning TD?     We could go all day.  Pittsburgh won.  Now stop being a sore winner.|`|UxooffHZaa	They could have called a hold on every single play of that game. The Cardinals offensive line couldn't handle woodley or harrison. period.|`|AA10939368	It was mentioned on several sports shows the past two days.  They also mentioned how few holding calls Gandy actually received compared to what he should have, he held James Harrison on almost every play and twice pulled his facemask and it was not called.  They also stated that clearly Gandy was outmatched.  But I am a realist and there were calls missed against both teams, overall I thought the referees did a pretty good job.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Because it was overshadowed by the complaints about the Warner fumble. Good question, good point. Star 4 u.|`|C290wQWGaa	The Cardinal fans are cry babies cause they gave a TD up when it counted|`|l3y23yVcaa	Maybe he was held, but after seeing him punching a Cardinals linemen to the ground I wouldn't have thrown a flag if I seen the Starting 11 Cardinals jump stomping on his crotch...    There is NO place in football for professional athletes to act like common street thugs...    As far as the game goes:    -The Safety call for holding in the end zone was legit   -There was NO roughing the passer... that was frivolous  -Holmes feet (both) were down in the end zone... TD  -Warner fumbled... the arm was NOT coming forward    What MY headline would read:    Arizona Cardinals CHEATED out of Super Bowl victory... by their own Defense!!!|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Holding is only going to be called if it affects the play directly.  No decent football official will call holding on a play where the player being held still makes the play.  In other words, sure he held, but he did a lousy job of it.  No harm = No foul.    I know it's not the rules "as written" but ask any football coach, athletic director, conference commissioner, etc. and they will all tell you that is the way they want the rule enforced.
YmV3TNTpaa	Talking about central defenders (not left or right backs), I think it depends.    If you're a strong defender basing your game on anticipation and headers you can keep going (you gave the best example, I'll add Lothar Matthaus, Fernando Couto and Marcel Desailly). And I see defenders like Sami Hyypia, Fabio Cannavaro or Sol Campbell still playing at a high level for the next 3 to 5 seasons (if they want so).    However, if you're a fast paced defender you cant handle top class games after a certain age. This kind of defenders are usually 'converted' defenders, players who started at a different position (Midfielders mostly). Look at what happened to players like Ivan Helguera or Samuel Kuffour. They were extremely skilled and were defenders of guarantees but the nature of their defense needs speed and following the opponent. And with these modern little devils playing at 100 per hour (Messi, Ronaldo, Robben, Aguero & co) you just can't follow if you're 32|`|4v278ckwaa	37-39 is the optimal retirement age for defenders because defending requires more physical strenght which a guy starts to lose around that age.|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Defending requires a different kind of strategy and game plan than for other players.  In my opinion defenders have a harder job than their teammates because they have to be able to read the game well and anticipate their opponents moves.  Therefore I think with age the players acquire these two skills, so the older the defender, the smarter and better.  And at what age a player, defender or not, retires is up to them, we can't really put an age cap on it.    Maldini is 40 and still playing, Figo is 37 and still playing and he's not a defender, Romario played till he was 41 and he's not a defender.  Zanetti is 35 and he still has the stamina of a 25 year old.  So again that depends on the player.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	40 years|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I agree with Freshy.    A perfect example was also Dino Zoff, legendary Juventus and Italian gk who captained the Italy winning WC side of 1982 at the age of FORTY (40)    I do think defenders GENERALLY last more but it is not necessarily the case. Inzaghi is a perfect other example of that
cOPCNP7Laa	umm yay? About time. Im tired of hearing about it.|`|LReOvHEdaa	Confusion reigns at the moment with Sport.RU claiming the deal is in doubt after talking to the FA.    Yes, its true, the transfer is in doubt. There is a chance it will take us 2-3 days. The odds are 50/50. If the transfer is declared invalid, Arshavin will be returned to Zenit. We cant rule this out. I dont think that would be a severe ruling: both clubs had a lot of time to complete it during the window.|`|p4H61jQDaa	does not matter for arsenal as he will not help them reach the top 4|`|4v278ckwaa	Yes it is Arshavin is officialy an arsenal player, He'll wear the no 13 or the 23.|`|ZZFa4FHMaa	the story finally ends..............
UzhfaJH2aa	Any game I've seen of theirs, Crosby is usually quite efficient in his own end. Ovechkin on the other hand doesn't seem to be as interested in his own end. Hard to say if this is due to coaching instructions on either's part, (particularly Ovie playing high, Crosby playing back more) or if it's natural instinct. Based on what I see, I'd have to give Crosby the nod.|`|Icze35Nqaa	I have to go with Crosby on that one.    Nice ''Ovechkin vs Crosby'' question BTW.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I watched the Washington-Ottawa game...at times, Ovechkin took his sweet time getting back on defence.

mMFJrPbvaa	Even Les Stroud/Grylls had some equipment with them.  Both carried knives, sometimes even a multitool.  They also always started off with freshwater, from a water bottle etc, as well as some trail food.  You would be foolish, asking to get hurt if you dont enter the woods prepared.  Bring stuff for a backpacking trip, a tent, enough food, water, sleeping bag, lighter/matches and fire starter, map/compass.  Do not be without your essentials.  Even the "pros" have a backup plan...Les Stroud has his Satellite phone and Grylls has his support crew there with him.  Bring the gear.  Doesnt mean you need to use it, but it`ll be good to have.  Can you start a fire in wet conditions with that flint and steel?  Can you build a proper shelter?  Do you know where to find food and water?  I`d pack the essentials and then some emergency equipment, this way you can bail yourselves out of a bad situation.

bvnzv923aa	Wow. way to just copy and paste my question. I just deleted mine though, I wish I had seen this before I deleted it. Thank you. I get to know the answer anyways....|`|4T5iaRKcaa	hey i tested my juvenile moves last year and i failed as well.  the judges said there were toe pushes which made my score go down.  i know that they are sick of hearing that sound of your toes on the ice.  as well was your eight step mohawk sequence close to the circle or going to all the dots.  my coach talked to the judges and they said there looking for more power and to get the same rotation by hitting the red dots in the middle of the rink.  to me the most difficult are the back cross strokes they are so easy to cheat and sometimes you don't notice that you cheat!...after working on it since then( i take the summers off from skating so i didn't test it again) im testing it on friday.  i know that the toe pushes and not enough extension was my problem. i hope that i helped you at all.  Keep your head up you can always retake the test remember that.  and just keep trying and you'll pass!!    kayleigh*|`|68744c9f9429250431dd651986db8a40aa	I think i passed juvenile on the 1st time..pre juvenile was the tricky one for me (it took 3 times!!!) Anyways, just work on getting more power and speed on all the moves, that is one of he main objectives. Bend your knees A LOT and avoid stiffness on the forward and backwards cross rolls. hmm what else is there..ohh yes the back three mohawks in a figure 8..right? That one just make sure that your circles are the same size and increase speed as you go (bend knees and use the edges!) And then on the 8 step, same thing just work on speed and also stay on the circle..going outside is bad and so is going inside. Overall work on having good posture, no toe pushing, and being confident (and nice to the judges) :)|`|dNn1nFhEaa	im getting ready for my juvenile free skate.  I have my moves in the field about 2 weeks after that.  Like the first answerer, my coach gets on my nerves about toe pushing.  He also said that i need to move my arms more gracefully.  He even started me on school figurines just to build my core stregnth.  He says that he likes how I do moves in the field with a rythmn.
v0MlomPoaa	They will both get a fair amount of playing time, at least until one out-performs the other.  I expect Salty to be the first stringer playing 3-4 games a week behind the plate, and Teagarden to play 2-3 a week.  Don't be surprised to see Max Ramirez get some games in there as well.    Unless they carry all three on the active 25-man roster, I don't expect to see any of them playing too much at DH.  If Blalock is healthy, he will get most of the DH at-bats.  If not, they might carry all three catchers with Ramirez likely playing more DH.    Since Salty prefers not to play first-base, and Chris Davis being handed the starting job, with Cat and Blalock able to play there as well, I don't think he will see much time there either.  I don't think Teagarden has ever played at first and would not expect him to see any action there.     It's difficult to predict their stats with them both having little experience and being so young.   I'd expect Saltamacchia to have the better offensive stats with more ABs than Teagarden  .|`|XkBzfEBUaa	Salty is awesome, i still miss him from the Braves    but he's versitile, so I'd say he moves to 1B|`|nqdDe3cJaa	what about Max Ramirez ? isnt he still on the Rangers ? if so, hes my bet to start.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Watch out for the Rangers.     Baseball America rated them as the  1 Minor league system last year.|`|39fxsuGaaa	Teagarden will get every opportunity to be the starter.  Saltalamacchia's starting to get the slight odour of bust around him...|`|e4WhipTHaa	Both will be on the Rangers until at least the July 31st deadline.  I see the Sox getting VERY agressive for Salty though.    I say they give Taylor Teagarden the catcher position and Salty the DH.  Taylor seems better defensively and Salty has a good bat so it is the best of both worlds the way I have it above.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Baseball America is very high on the Rangers, they should be contenders, and just hope management has the ability to pull the right strings to bring in some role players to put them over the hump. They need to stay away from the big contracts, they don't work for teams like the Rangers.    Their pitching should be made a little stronger. If you look at the teams that won consistently over the last 30 years, you can see its all about pitching. Look at the 1990s Braves as an example.
4991t6mjaa	That's quite a difficult question to answer but i think there are around 30,000 people in America with USFA memberships. USFA stands for the United States Fencing Association and you have to join if you want to fence at competitions. Obviously, there are also fencers in the USA without a USFA membership but i think it would be quite hard to work out how many. I'm not really sure about the rest of the world but i can definitely say that fencing is a lot more popular in Italy and France than in the UK and USA and i also think that there are large numbers in Hungary and Russia. Hope that helps!
6n8LdKEUaa	Robinho is too accused of rape, at England... it's very serious...|`|ZCzAhuafaa	he never got accused, did you know Ray Lewis got charged of murder. no one cares anymore. she probably dropped the case because she already got the attention she wanted and she didnt care anymore because she was probably lying|`|rEafx4QTaa	the accuser did not testify because the defense would have tore her to pieces on the stand. The underwear she submitted that Kobe's semen on it had at least 3 other semen DNA on it (aka she had like at least 3 others guys semen on her underwear). No one really know what happened but because of the circumstances i'm gonna give kobe the benefit of the doubt.|`|3QuZeCB4aa	Did you also know that all of what you said is OLD NEWS?  Live for today not the past.|`|xe0MsmWGaa	yes .. ive only heard of this because of south park and ppl .. but how is he in the NBA Cares program then? I mean .. really .. if he really raped someone do u think the NBA would allow him near kids?|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	There was no civil suit. Kobe settled out of court. The police/DA would not file a criminal case. It was consensual. She went to his room TWICE. She had prior history of mental problems. She got her thing with Kobe and big bucks to boot. Kobe was guilty of stupidity but nothing else. Big names get "approached" all the time but most have the smarts to avoid this type of result.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	you know this is really old news?  everyone knows this already.    i also hear his bodyguard or whatever is in jail for trying to kill her.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Did, you know you fall into the same category as all the other sheeple.|`|AA10188905	LOL I havent seen any proof of him paying off the accuser and wikipedia is not the most reliable source so I would not use that as the base of my argument. I am a fan of Kobe and I think he is innocent of rape, but he still cheated on his wife and I lost a lot of respect for him for that. My two theories of why the accuser dropped the suit is because either she was lying or because she was getting blasted all over the web and in the media and she just didnt want all the craziness to continue. My bet is a combination of the two.|`|AA10425091	Did you know she begged him for it only to extort money.. He had to use this strategy help his cause. Did you know that the county in Colorado in 98% white.
BIwZ7klfaa	Steve Austin, A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	I think that they said on raw monday night that he would be inducted by dusty rhodes.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	I know austin wants Ric Flair to do it, but i dont know if he said yes, i think it should be JR as they are good friends. They said on Raw that Dusty Rhodes would be inducting someone into the HOF, but that someone wasnt Stone Cold, i cant remember who it was, think it might have been a tag team.|`|UbUSth5haa	Since Austin inducted Bret, then Bret should induct Austin.|`|U3KAgO0baa	Austin wants JR 2 be the one, But in  JR's Blog a few weeks ago he said (and i think WWE has Confirmed) that Ric Flair will be the one...|`|Lv89kHKpaa	Shark Boy|`|U5q7k3Geaa	Mr McMahon
tY3rZSsiaa	id take amare out, hes just not producing for his salary.  you can go with rookies like derrick rose, oj mayo and stock up with big salary guys like lebron or cp3.  i couldnt tell you since i dont play salary cap but rose and mayo for their price seems good.  durant and lee are good picks.  duncans good, but im not sure if you cant get more value for the price.  perhaps brandon roy?
tY3rZSsiaa	its not like he can make a difference, hes good but he just doesnt make anyone around him better. he may even actually make his team worse.  i dont think he plans on coming back this year, hes just not showing any signs of coming back.  he seems to enjoy sitting on the sideline colllecting his huge paychecks.|`|NzS7yD32aa	He wouldn't be on my team if i was the GM     He getting paid to do nothing    He is a faker|`|GwawzO5Faa	Next year. There's really no need playing him in this wasted season.|`|HLzS2z9laa	neva eva|`|UY72nsdiaa	He's healthy enough to play right now but claims, "he isn't 100 percent." I'm not sure what 100 percent means in his book but this could mean possibly sitting out another month or even the rest of the season. I don't see any reasons as why he wouldn't want to play even if his team is bad, he can contribute to his stats very easily in that situation. He would get alot of playing time, but you just really can't tell when a guy like Gilbert will be back. Right now it isn't on the coach, the docter; just on Agent Zero himself, and it has to be him that makes the decision.|`|AA10425091	He has no reason to comeback at this point . He may injury himself even more. That is what happened last year when the Wizs rushed him back on the court.. Team management does not care about players,|`|rEafx4QTaa	im sure he'll return this season when he's healthy. It will be good for him to get back in the swing of things, get his wind, his timing right, obviously he wont play 40plus minutes like usual but they'll want him to be game ready for next yr|`|AA11488609	Sometime after all star break is my guess.  He is getting a lot of pressure from Wizards fans, management, his sponsors, and the like to at least show up and play for the sake of playing.|`|25ymUKdraa	arenas should not comeback yet, they wouldnt make the playoffs anyway. save it for next yr.
RS3fjNboaa	They should tag Al Davis with a tranquilizer dart.|`|e4ekb1amaa	No one - they need to save their money, and cut dead weight on their roster. Also, I believe that yesterday was the last day to tag anyone.<br>  <br>  Knowing Al Davis though, they'll probably come out of left field and tag Rich Gannon.|`|AOA8TJraaa	The deadline for tagging is done. The deadline was yesterday, which was Thursday, but if they still had their tag, they should tag Al Davis's    @$$!|`|ETfgBxUbaa	thay taged there punter i heard and the raiders dont have that much money to tag anyone else espiacelly that there gonna need to sign draft picks......... my prediction raider will 6 wins or 7 this year|`|DjF6Uytuaa	Tim Tebow|`|fKco44yxaa	Ryan Leaf|`|NzbJ0Jvkaa	they should tag al davis with a "UR FIRED"
4blCVEvOaa	A player who is on the field can step out of bounds and then come back into the field of play to make a tackle.    A player can't go out of bounds, come back in and be the first one to touch the ball.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It Harrison had fumbled and Fitzgerald had picked it up, that would have been a penalty for illegal participation, since he can't be the first to touch the ball directly after going out of bounds.    Also, had this occured on a kick or punt return, the tackle would have been enough to get a penalty for illegal participation.    However, a receiver can make a tackle on the ball carrier after going out of bounds.    I have no idea why, but apparently that's how it works.|`|l3y23yVcaa	I think that the out of bounds rule only applies to ball carriers.    For instance if a WR is pushed out of bounds he may NOT be the first person to touch the ball or the pass is ruled incomplete... or if Harrison had lateraled the ball to someone who was coming in from being pushed out  it would be a dead ball where ever they touched it. The same rule however, does not apply to non-ball carriers, as far as I know.    Horn!!!|`|yoytdRGTaa	You can come from out of bounds to tackle someone.  You just can't come from out of bounds to make a catch.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	A defensive player (which Fitzgerald was since his team no longer had the ball) may go out of bounds and return in bounds during a play.  An offensive player may not unless he was forced out by an opponent and returns at the first opporunity.|`|IWPcs8kaaa	you can make a tackle form out of bounds but if you step out you cant catch the ball|`|rW4bt6ZAaa	That rule only applies for receiving. For example, if he was running a route and went out of bounds and came back in bounds and caught the ball, than it would be a penalty. However, since Fitzgerald was on the field when they play started, he can still make a tackle if he went out of bounds on the play. He just has to be on the field when the play starts.|`|oFYpCSdCaa	FITZGERALD RAN OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 45, HE WAS NOT PUSHED OUT RAN DOWN TO MAKE THE TACKLE OUT OF BOUNDS THE WHOLE WAY, MADE CONTACT TO MAKE THE TACKLE WHILE STILL OUT OF BOUNDS. HE KNEW HE COULDN'T GET BLOCKED IF HE WAS RUNNING DOWN THE SIDELINE OUT OF BOUNDS!
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	You could check out the Fan Forum at WWE Fan Nation for a few more ideas on that.<br>  <a href="http://fans.wwe.com/go/thread/view/691/13098449/William_Regal_Appreciation_Thread" rel="nofollow">http://fans.wwe.com/go/thread/view/691/1...</a>|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Yes and no he dose get a large british fanbade but he is also very talented and good with the younger stars helping them get a feel for the business.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	The reason is simple he is a great wrestling with good mic skills and can get a good match out of just about anyone. He is held highly here in the UK because british wrestling in general is very technical and we nearly all love a good technical wrestler, even if he wasn't british Regal would be huge with any fan of the style because he is just a proper wrestlers wrestler and very good at it. Talent keeps him around not nationality.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	He has not been used properly , it's pointless in British wrestlers going to the WWE because either they are not simply good enough for the US or vince has a huge anti  British sentiment . I never believed that the british Bulldog has going to be WWE champion despite the rumours . Regal can actually wrestle - but it isn't enough .|`|oAjbBLDpaa	No, he's very skilled in technical wrestling. If the company used him well, he could make a great world champion. His feud with CM Punk is a great display of his technical abilities.|`|xN050AUXaa	don't no|`|24d92bd0241aeea71cccfaf017c6c707aa	He is a steroetype of an englishman. I think most english people hate that and scottish and welsh people don't feel they are part of the british angle either, so I don't know why you think he is a hero in britian.|`|bT0kyzRPaa	ouch i think someone hit the nail right on the head... quite possibly

And the commission stepped in.    Also, NSAC rules state that excessive amounts of vaseline can not be used on the face or the body.

It is the best. Like it or not.    India can win 5-0, but MS Dhoni said he will give the other players a chance next time.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Probably India are the best. Because in the recent two years Indian team won over all of the top countries. But if you look out for SA. They have only won against Aus.       South Africa have beaten Australia in the five-match one-day series in Australia, and that means they now displace Australia at the top of the ICC one-day rankings. The Proteas have managed to scrape ahead of Australia by 0.21 points.    South Africa coach Mickey Arthur recently said he didnt think his team were ready to take the number one ranking. What did he exactly mean to say? Did he mean to say the South Africans are not yet a world-beating unit like the Australians have been over the last decade? Or did he mean to say the South Africans hadnt done enough to claim the number one ranking?    South Africa have no doubt been one of the most successful teams in one-day cricket over the last three years; in 2007, they won 19 of their 30 ODI appearances, while in 2008, they won 12 of their 17 ODIs, and this year, they have a 4-1 win-loss record from five matches. That converts to an overall success rate of 67%  impressive, one should say.    But a closer look at the road theyve taken reveals that theyve hardly been tested  although for no fault of theirs.    Now, a close look at the table above will reveal that Graeme Smith and Co. have played a large number of their matches against teams that have generally remained in the bottom half of the ICC rankings table  more than 19 off their 47 matches (and 18 off their 35 victories) have come against the likes of Bangladesh, Kenya, West Indies, Zimbabwe and the associate nations.    Teams            in 2007 (W-L )    in 2008 (W-L)  Australia           2(0-2)                  0  Bangladesh   1(0-1)                  5 (5-0)  England           1(1-0)                  5 (0-4)  India           3(1-2)                  0  Ireland           2(2-0)                  0  Netherlands   1(1-0)                  0  Kenya           0                             2 (2-0)  New Zealand   4 (2-2)                  0  Pakistan          10 (6-3)                  0  Scotland           1(1-0)                  0  Sri Lanka   1(1-0)                  0  West Indies   1(1-0)                  5(5-0)  Zimbabwe   3 (3-0)                  0           Total          30 (19-10)        17 (12-4)    Lets see how theyve fared against teams who occupy the top half of the table. Against Pakistan, who were ranked third and fourth when the two teams met in February and October 2007, South Africa beat them 3-1 in a five-match series, and then managed a narrow 3-2 win in the five-match series in Pakistan.    When pitted against the top ranked Australians, the South Africans floundered - losing both the matches they played by convincing margins. Sixth-ranked India beat them 2-1 in a three-match series in Netherlands, while they have an even two wins-two losses record against New Zealand who were ranked third when the two teams met. Add to this, the Proteas even lost a five-match series 0-4 to seventh ranked England.    So, in essence, the just concluded series against Australia is the only time the Proteas have beaten a better ranked team hands down. They have looked the better of the two teams in the series, play an exciting brand of cricket and were deserving winners. But is their performance in just that one series enough to elevate them to the number one position in the world?    Arent rankings system supposed to deliver results where teams are judged over a period of time, have beaten teams of all strengths and in all conditions? South Africa havent played a match in India, Sri Lanka or New Zealand in the last three years  so that leaves question marks over the ranking system.|`|LGwHPlPCaa	YES,INDIA is the BEST ODI team this time. 8 consistent victories are the proof of my statement.Each & every player is doing so well.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	may be maybe not,...

India look good because they are playing against teams that are lower than them in the rankings, South Africa thrashed Australia (who were the number 1 team) 4-1 in the latest series including one win by 40 runs while they were resting their top 2 bowlers  They have the best depth since their stand in batsmen in Duminy and their stand in bowlers have shown they are still a force to be reconed with.  India however would be lost if 2 or 3 of their top 3 players were rested, they rely too much on their big names to be counted as the worlds number 1 side, they also have  a dubious record away from home on seaming wickets such as in New Zealand and England.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes
PQmCk7Fiaa	It really doesn't matter; but coming from my perspective. I tend to play basketball first not only for cardio but for warmups. I don't seem to find any significant health issues if you hit the weights and play basketball right after. In the end, your doing it for your body.<br>  <br>  However, I tend to play basketball first so that way I won't use the excuse "OH I just did weights, I can't shoot... Thus limiting/embarassing yourself when you play." It's really up to you. I had a friend that bench presses 185 and shoots fade-away 3s like its nothing. So its different among different people.
AA11506593	I don't believe that anyone has ever been shot by a CLOCK!|`|OvSoKoLRaa	LOL...I've heard of people beating the clock!  But is this the clock's revenge?  :D  I've heard of time and bullets flying...but I never realized the two were ever connected.  ;D<br>  <br>  Actually, you see this in movies, people holding their fire arms sideways...this is retarded if you wish to actually hit your target and to handle the pistol's recoil in as healthy a manner as possible.  In other words, it is best to hold your pistol as naturally as possible.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	Cause they're idiots.<br>  The practice of holding it that way derived form the Mossad's training of rotating 90 charging the weapon and bringing it up while rotating back 90 to get sights on target. "Gangstas" just though it looked "More G" and tougher to hold it that way. Funny thing is that they can't hit anything more than 5 feet away...unless it's a barn! Which is why so many innocents get shot. They can't aim for **** so the belief is to spray as much as possible and hope out of the 50 rounds you fired, one hit the target. If they ever discover how to rotate their wrists back to the correct way we're in trouble!|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	It's actually a terrible position for your wrist and reduces accuracy.  You'll notice that professional firearms handlers all adopt a barrel up grip down, and street thugs hold them to the side.  I'd go with the pros on this one.

Maybe next week, but give it time.  And another thing, don't stress out and over practice.  Having a bad week happens to the best of us.   Good luck!|`|u3FqxhY8aa	Don't worry people go into slumps all of the time, the reality is you are rarely ever going to play the same way every time that you play.  Just do what you feel comfortable doing for now and it should come back to you pretty quickly, just don't put yourself to really high standards or anything because that could potentially destroy your mental game.  And yeah and fellow Novak fan =P !

AA10404097	I think that would be a good game if they can get McNabb some people to throw to. I think he is a great quarterback with poor support. The Steelers are the total package.

However, I think you'll find that with the economy the way it is, and the inflation that is sure to follow when this administration continues to go to the printing press and the tax office, you won't be able to afford the officiating you had this year.

Cage may be the HBK of TNA, but he's nothing on the real HBK.  WINNER: Shawn Michaels    Aj styles vs Edge  9/10 - Edge takes this match via some sort of cheat, solely because AJ is a better in-ring wrestler...  but Edge is smarter.  Edge will take advantage of any and every injury, and take the match.  Easy peasy.  WINNER: Edge    Chris jericho vs Kurt angle  10/10 - This match has happened many times before, and I sorely miss the feuds they had.  But the match would end in a draw, both are huge draws for their respective federation, and both are amazing mic and ring talents.  There's no advantage.  WINNER: DRAW VIA DOUBLE COUNTOUT    sting vs undertaker  10/10 - This is a legendary match.  No match would have a higher placement in anyone's mind, either.  Right now, it's the most wanted match in the history of Sports Entertainment, right up there with Hogan vs. Rock, or Goldberg vs. Austin...  In the end, I see Undertaker winning...  but only after a huge amount of interferences from other legendary people from each of their pasts.  WINNER: Undertaker    Rey mysterio vs homicide  6/10 - The match will be a botched spotfest.  Both are great for spots, but both are ridiculously notorious for screwing them up.  This match seems like a great idea, but in the end, it won't be the best...  Rey will win via 619, despite interference from Hernandez.  WINNER: Rey Mysterio    Team 3D vs Priceless  4/10 - Team 3D will win this easy...  but the problem is that neither have enough ring psychology to put on a good match.  This match will be sloppy, ugly, and in the end unsatisfying.  WINNER: Team 3D    Beer money vs Miz and Morrison  5/10 - Another sloppy match in the making.  Miz and Morrison will win via a missed beer bottle shot, and the match will seem like a disaster.  Too bad, too...  because both teams are great ideas, and could be future legends if kept serious.  WINNER: Miz and Morrison    Kaz vs Shelton benjamin  8/10 - Both of these guys can put on a match that will fry the audience's brains...  the only problem is that no one cares about either's characters.  This match will end with Benjamin on top, just because he's got a better following.  WINNER: Shelton Benjamin    Christopher daniels vs Jeff hardy  9/10 - I'm going to pull a "screw you" here and make Daniels win.  Why?  Because Daniels is my all time favorite...  and he's facing one of the worst wrestlers in the business.  Jeff's entire moveset consists of him being Steve-O and launching himself off of things with the hopes of not hurting himself...  Daniels entire moveset consists of reversing said ideas into ridiculous moves that no one would ever think of doing.  In the end, Hardy would be outsmarted, and Daniels would be standing tall.  WINNER: Christopher Daniels    Umaga vs somoa Joe  4/10 - Umaga has NOTHING on Joe's talent.  Joe will wipe the floor with Umaga, even if there's interference.  Joe has this in the bag...  the worst of it?  It's going to be a very boring match since Umaga cannot keep up with Joe at all.  WINNER: Samoa Joe    Matt morgan vs big show  1/10 - This match will be slow, and corny.  And most likely short as hell.  Big Show will take the cake, and probably eat it, too.  WINNER: Big Show    HHH vs Abyss  4/10 - This doesn't seem like a good match up at all.  Abyss is too much of a hardcore monster type to be in the ring fairly against Triple H who is a brawler.  Triple H has way more ability and following...  and probably won't be able to pull the match.  So then end will look dirty and Triple H will win...  because he doesn't let anyone over him.   WINNER: Triple H    Alex shelly vs Evan bourne  7/10 - I've seen this match happen in ROH when Evan was known as Matt Sydal.  This is a good spotfest match, and neither are known for botching their spots.  I see this being a good match, with Chris Sabin coming in for the save, and a doubleteam on Bourne, so Shelley can pick up the win.  WINNER: Alex Shelley    Kofi kingston vs chris sabin  6/10 - Sabin will actually be taken around the ring in a speedfest, but Sabin will get the win after Shelley comes back to save him.  The match will only get a few big cheers, though, as neither Kofi nor Sabin have the charisma to really get over.  WINNER: Chris Sabin    Homicide vs vladimer kozlov  2/10 - With Homicide coming back out for a second match, despite losing to Rey earlier in the night, Kozlov will DESTROY him.  Plain and simple.  It'll just be another squash...  but then Hernandez will come out and make a challenge to Kozlov, only to be destroyed as well in an even worse match than the first.  WINNER:  Vladimir Kozlov...  twice.    Awsome kong vs Beth pheoneix  7/10 - This match will go full tilt, showing the true capabilities of the women's division in each fed...  but in the end, Kong has more experience and ability, and this would go to the true she-beast of the ring.  WINNER: Awesome Kong|`|9CLRMnhSaa	hbk  10/10  y2j  10/10  edge  10/10  taker  3/10  rey  10/10  priceless  6/10  beer money  4/10  shelton  7/10  jeff hardy  10/10  umaga  100/100  big show  1/10  hhh  8/10  evan  10/10  kozlov  10/10  pheoneix  9.5/10  mickie   4/10|`|6a4JU9gIaa	the miz

Also, it helps if you post your state in questions like this.|`|MzmDqZ26aa	What the guy above me said.    Also, if your state allows it, get a CCW permit. Do your part to keep yourself and your loved ones protected.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Handguns have restrictions for those under 21.  In most areas of the US, you can go buy a rifle, shotgun, or carbine today.  Good luck!|`|vea6mqPZaa	Yes    Federal law states you must be 18 to purchase a long gun or a handgun.  Federal law also states that a FFL dealer can NOT sell a handgun to anyone less than 21.    Now here is where this gets interesting.    Your coming 20. As per the BATFE you can go buy a handgun or a long gun.    If you want to buy a handgun you will have to do it as a private party sale as there is no Federal restriction on the sale other than you must be 18 and not a criminal.    Now you state may say otherwise.  Some of the Commie states like the Peoples Republik of Commifornia, and Illinois have all kinds of infringements on the Second Amendment so they can "curb gun violence" or as I see it "Control their subjects".    You need to check your State laws.

He may have one or two 1,000 yard seasons left in the tank (but probably will get there on less then 4 yards a carry), but he will be a platoon guy within 4 seasons.|`|WrDGhduxaa	It depends, he has been injured, so is that a sign of getting old or just something that happened and he is going to be fine next season.<br>  He still has the talent it depends whether the wear and tear on his body has diminished his skills.<br>  He is a great running back but we don't know if he can still perform over the long season without breaking down.<br>  Regardless he has had a great career.

nDzenpkwaa	I have to give him credit for his K's and No Hitters, but he walked a lot of guys too and he didn't win games like the "greats" did.

He is in the HOF so he is considered a great, but he doesn't reach my top 10 pitchers of all time list...|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Because he's simply not one of the greats.. <br>  He's done some great things, but he doesn't belong in the upper echelon of pitching.<br>  <br>  People bring up 2 or 3 things.<br>  5714 K's <br>  7 no hitters.<br>  longevity<br>  <br>  Well, first of all, he got 5714 K's because of longevity.<br>  Had he retired at 40, he would have had 4547 K's, still a great total.<br>  His 7 no-hitters, amazing, but hardly the instance that defines greatness.  There are a lot of below average pitchers who've thrown no hitters<br>  <br>  Hit .526 winning % is very average..<br>  His K's are great, but he also is the walk leader by a large margin.<br>  His 2795 walks beats Carlton's 2nd place (1833) by 52%.<br>  His K lead is only 19% over Randy Johnson<br>  <br>  He led in K's 11x..  but he led the league 8x in walks, 2x over 200 in a season.  <br>  <br>  He was never, EVER, the best pitcher in the league in any single year.<br>  He has fewer top 10 Cy Young seasons than Mike Mussina..<br>  His ERA+ is rather pedestrian at 111.<br>  The guys around that ERA+ are AJ Burnett, Freddy Garcia, Orlando Hernandez..<br>  <br>  The additional years didn't even negatively affect his ERA+.<br>  <br>  He was a great athlete, but there are PLENTY of better pitchers out there.<br>  If I knew what their careers would be like and wanted to win, I'd much rather take Greg Maddux over Nolan Ryan.  If I wanted to get ticket sales, I may take Ryan.|`|h074DM42aa	He threw hard and had a lot of strikeout, and those no-hitters are something.<br>  <br>  But . . .<br>  <br>  When looking at the teams he was on, the higher than average ERA, a whole ton of walks.  Well, he does leave a bit to be desired.  <br>  <br>  Certainly among the greats--and I was fortunate to watch him along with several others growing up (Mike Schmidt, Ozzie Smith, Kirby Puckett--to name a few)--but not like the legends of old.|`|AA11620976	Actually for some weird -azz reason which only his legions of supporters get, his name is brought many more times than the -vastly -better- in- all- respects Tom Seaver's name is.>Strange but true|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	You must be listening to different discussions than I do.  He's usually referred to as a legend.<br>  <br>  A few possible reasons, Ryan never sought the limelight, his W-L percentage isn't the greatest because he played on some bad teams, his record in the post-season is limited because he played on bad teams and lastly, some people saw him as just a fireballing strike out pitcher.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	As great as he was he never won a Cy Young and he's not that far over .500 for his career.   He needed 25 years to get to 300 wins, and came close to losing 300 as well.    And he pitched mostly in the post-expansion, pre-steroid era when lineups were much less potent.  But I think his strikeout totals and no-hitters are unbelievable achievements which will never be matched.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	I feel like he is always brought up...<br>  Maybe that's because I've been watching Randy Johnson pitch for the past decade and he's been chasing Ryan's K record so they talk about it often during the games Johnson pitches|`|sSOqEzqxaa	BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT LISTENING! HE IS ONE OF GREATS EVER! AND NOBODY WILL BREAK HIS STRIKEOUT RECORD|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Since when is Nolan Ryan a great pitcher?<br>  <br>  Great pitchers have a winning percentage at least 60% during their career.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Because Ryan never had any dominant seasons.  He threw really hard for a really long time which enabled him to amass more strikeouts than any pitcher ever but there's more to pitching than strikeouts.<br>  <br>  Sure Ryan had some great games as evidence by his 7 no hitters but he also had the most walks in history, and never won a Cy Young award which most "great" pitcher have.<br>  <br>  edit: The Ryan supporters always bring up him playing for "bad teams".  Here are Ryan's records in seasons with 25+ starts and the record of his team. <br>  <br>  1971 NYM 10-14 (83-79)<br>  1972 CAL 19-16 (75-80)<br>  1973 CAL 21-16 (79-83)<br>  1974 CAL 22-16 (68-94)<br>  1975 CAL 14-12 (72-89)<br>  1976 CAL 17-18 (76-86)<br>  1977 CAL 19-16 (74-88)<br>  1978 CAL 10-13 (87-75)<br>  1979 CAL 16-14 (88-74)<br>  1980 HOU 11-10 (93-70)<br>  1982 HOU 16-12 (77-85)<br>  1983 HOU 14-9 (85-77)<br>  1984 HOU 12-11 (80-82)<br>  1985 HOU 10-12 (83-79)<br>  1986 HOU 12-8 (96-66)<br>  1987 HOU 8-16 (76-86)<br>  1988 HOU 12-11 (82-80)<br>  1989 TEX 16-10 (83-79)<br>  1990 TEX 13-9 (83-79)<br>  1991 TEX 12-6 (85-77)<br>  1992 TEX 5-9 (77-85)<br>  <br>  So for the people that say he constanly pitched for a bad team the only argument you really have is 1974.  In 1978, 1979, and 1980 he was a .500 pitcher while his teams were winning an average of more than 89 games a year. The rest of the time most of his teams were right around .500, just like him.  In 27 seasons Ryan had the best winning percentage on his team only 4 times. By comparison, Frank Tanana, also did it 4 times in just the 7 years they were teammates.

uzNm9KtYaa	Pigeons are not afraid of the human face.  Few animals are.  Even the ugliest face makes no impression on a pigeon.  It is the entire form and size of a human that intimidates animals because they can identify the human for what he is....one of their predators.  To hide from a pigeon or anything else you decide to hunt, you must conceal yourself as completely as you can.  Camouflage is printed for a good reason to look like the habitat in which you are hunting.  It does some good but not enough to camo your torso and then leave your face glaring out of the concealment like a spotlight.  Complete the process of camouflage by covering every part of your anatomy including your hands and face.  EVEN when you are hunting the very common and easy to bag pigeon.|`|AA12034449	If you look like Steven Segal with the headgear on your pigeon will die of a heart attack|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I always wear a camo balaclava when duck hunting, and when deer hunting, even from a tree stand.  <br>  A black one will definitely help, but a camo one would help even more, by breaking up the outline of your silhouette.

sqfjfR3iaa	I don't think he's going to wait for the 2009 WWE Draft, he's going to come to Raw and fight Randy Orton as much as he wants. He's going to be on Raw next week, Triple H is not going to wait until April. I don't think the Undertaker is interested in moving to Raw, unless Michell McCool is move to Raw as well. Mark Calaway is dating Michelle McCool and if they are on separate shows, they will no longer be able to see each other as much.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I don't think they will wait so long to draft him.I think with him now involved in this McMahon Orton feud and him being champion and part of the family and  taken Raw has no title currently.Stephanie and Shane will trade him to Raw.Maybe moving John Cena to Smackdown main event for main event kind of deal.I don't think we will have to wait for the draft.So Steph will probably make the trade so Triple H will be on Raw with the title which solves that problem.And the McMahon Orton rivalry needed a family member to be champion so Orton could face them at Wrestlemania because he won the Royal Rumble.And John Cena and Edge started that little feud on Raw.Over the world heavy weight champion.Fair trade then right?So main event for main event trade,and it works out because John Cena can't stay out of the main event so really what was he going to do on Raw because they are focusing on a new McMahon-Helmsly era and a mix of the old Stone Cold crossing the boss in there too with Randy.So there isn't any room for Cena to main event.So Smackdown seems like the place he will go.So maybe then Smackdown can stay PG and Raw's rating will go up?<br>  <br>  As for the Undertaker,I don't think so.They will most likely just have Shawn Micheals and the Undertaker threaten each other in between the shows because there is already so much hype between the two with out a feud for Wrestlemania 25.Both from Texas have a huge history together,great in ring chemestry working with each other for over 16 years,long time in the making,had classic matches together in the past,both competed in the first Hell in A Cell match.All that hype doesn't need a major feud.So they will more then likely stay on Smackdown and Raw.And have an interpromotional match at Wrestlemania 25.|`|plhLIIeAaa	Raw is supposed to leagues ahead of SmackDown. It is the flagship company. HHH and Undertaker will stay in Smackdown. They have taken this side of the company to slow down their travels to be with family more.

At WM25, HHH will face Orton for the WWE title & Cena will face Edge for the WHC.  While Cena will get his title back, HHH will retain his to keep each title on it's respective show.  The Raw situation of Steph getting RKO'd & Hunter now becoming involved is due to Edge losing the Chamber match at No Way Out, then winning the WHC.  Technically, Smackdown now has both World titles, something that cannot stay as is, as Raw is the flagship show & MUST have a champion..

I1w0HfQbaa	Here is how the match begins: Mike Tyson enters the ring but Kimbo sneaks behind him and hits Mike with a steel chair! That is right! A steel chair! He hits Mike with a pair of brass knuckles and then takes his belt and hits Mike on the backside repeatedly. Two minutes into the match Mike's friend Stone Cold Steve Austin enters the fray from ringside. But Steve is dressed in woman's drag so the fans do NOT realize that he is Stone Cold. Stone Cold hits Kimbo Slice with a STONE COLD STUNNER and Kimbo is out like a light. Mike Tyson runs off the ropes and hits Kimbo with THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW on Kimbo and pins Kimbo as special guest referee Joe Frazier counts one, two, three. The match is over and Mike Tyson's hand is raised in victory. The result: MIKE TYSON wins over kimbo after he hits kimbo with a people's elbowdrop and Stone Cold Steve Austin's interference.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Tyson is looking pretty fat these days and is not in training, there is no truth in a Tyson-Slice fight. And if they did fight Tyson would wreck him within a few seconds even out of shape and 40.<br>  <br>  The Tyson movie coming out is not a movie movie, its a documentary, Tyson is only in it doing a monologue and interviews so there would be no need for him to get into shape for it, the last time I seen Tyson was at a fight, I think DeLaHoya-Pacquiao and he was looking pretty tubby.<br>  <br>  He already turned down a big offer to fight Holyfield so I would think the chance of him taking a fight with Kimbo is unlikely, he seems to be truly retired and trying to make money off his name.|`|ebfb6f74ff2342b199ea5099662b442eaa	A damaged Tyson should be able able to beat a stiff like Slice.

nqdDe3cJaa	i agree.  its like Dwight Clarks TD pass reception from Montana in the NFC Championship Game against the Cowboys.  big deal .... he jumped up and caught the ball ..... whoopie !!!!! Santonio Holmes toe tap Super Bowl winning TD was FAR more impressive in my mind, in a much more important game.  while Willies catch was nice ...... Jim Edmunds has about 20 catches that put it to shame.  i mean ..... come on .... Edmunds laid out with his back to home plate and caught the freaking ball.  there has never been a better center fielder in the history of the game than Edmunds.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	A. He threw to second to hold the runner, not to home  B. World Series game on the line.  C. Willie always played some what shallow, in order to get to blooper type center field possible hits.  D. This was his home field and he knew it very well.  E. He made a difficult over the shoulder catch and made a super throw in to second trying to catch the runner who was almost to third when the catch was made.The throw was made without planting his feet, sort of whirling and throwing at the same time. Incredible.|`|PwED69Isaa	I understand what you mean. Players nowadays make plays somewhat similar fairly routinely. Look at Jim Edmonds and Torii Hunter. Even Ankiel has had some. Mays' catch can almost be considered "before his time". Spectacular plays did not happen as often then as they do with the extremely athletic guys playing now. If it happened today, it probably would be  1 Top Play on Sportscenter and get a decent amount of talk. But that is probably it.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	mainly because he didn't "showboat" the catch like many players do today|`|4TgxrCX4aa	The thing that makes the Catch more challenging then any play today is that Mays ran 50 more feet than any play that could be made today, many players today barely catch up to balls hit against the wall, but Mays had to run 50 feet past that.    Another component of it is his throw which had to be quick, accurate, and very far, catching the ball 50 feet farther away than most outfield walls meant he had to through the ball 50 feet farther with his momentum going the wrong way.  It could be said that the throw rather than the catch saved the game, if the runner on base could have tagged and gone home rather than stopping at third, the game would be lost.    The third part that makes it well remembered is the stage where it happened.  This was a televised World Series game in New York at a time when many games weren't televised so seeing such a spectacular play on TV made it special for many people.  Combine that with the importance and pressure of each game of World Series especially one tied in the late innings and you have an event that's stays in people's memories for decades.    While it's an amazing catch in itself, it's the stage it happened on that gave it legend status.  Mays himself didn't think it was the best catch he ever made, but combine it with the quick throw in and the close, televised World Series game in New York City and the Catch is remarkable.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	It was over 50 years ago and you are still asking questions about it.   That should tell you how great the catch was.|`|huyscDuWaa	The difference with the ones today and the one Mays made is the distance that had to be covered.   Modern day parks aren't nearly as deep as the Polo Grounds was.    The catch alone was exceptional, but it was the throw that was made to nearly double off the runner that made it truely great.

91bc8531749c0c8370584cc0847c73cfaa	I have a Felt Dispatch, Felt Curbside and a Bianchi San Jose.  I've also ridden the Langster a few times.  Here are my 2 cents on each...    FELT DISPATCH - Amazing bike and probably best if you live in a hilly area, as the gearing is low to easily get you up the hills.  But you will bottom out as you won't be able to achieve a good top speed (16/39t).  The frame is very solid, stiff and light.  This is an aluminum frame, unlike the Langster and Bianchi.  Extremely comfortable and good quality.    FELT CURBSIDE - Again, good bike.  However, with the flatbars and geometry, it does ride a little differently.  This feels like more of a casual trick cruising bike, whereas the Dispatch has more of a road bike quality, but the gearing and frame material is the same.    SPECIALIZED LANGSTER - Another good option.  But with it's track bars and lower stance, it's a more aggressive riding stance.  It doesn't feel as stiff and stable as the Felt's mentioned above, but it is a better responding bike.  The gearing is also higher (16/42t), which takes a little more work getting up the hills, but you can have a higher top end speed w/out looking like the road runner.    BIANCHI SAN JOSE - This is a cyclocross bike, so it comes with knobby tires and v-brakes.  Personally, this is my favorite b/c it is an all-steel frame, has a riding position similar to the langster with the highest gearing at (17/42t) of all the bikes.    But ultimately, whatever you choose will be a good quality bike as you've given yourself a good selection.  Good luck and enjoy the short 5 mile commute.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	You totally forgot the Cannondale Capo....     http://www.cannondale.com/bikes/09/cusa/...|`|aQcsrgLCaa	Try looking up Alf Webb at 'Webbline' or the 'Bike inn'.    They produce a fantastic fixed gear/single speed bike at a fantastic price. I bought one last year and I am still delighted by my purchase.    Trouble is, for you, they don't have any mudguard/rack braze ons.

JD5NQxeNaa	Ron D the biggest upset in NBA playoffs history would be more of the Seattle Super-Sonics losing to the Denver Nuggets because that paved the way for the Knicks and Warriors to do the unthinkable later down the road. That Nuggets team w/ the exception of Deke Mutombo was complete and utter trash and the Sonics had Hall of Famer in Payton, a HOF coach in Karl, All-stars in Kemp, Schrempf, etc.    Anyways, I like the Mavs and Dirk is a great player and Kidd adds on experience to a talented team, but their d is inconsistent and that could hurt them, like it did when they lost to 2 inexperienced young teams in the playoffs, like the Warriors and Hornets. However, Dirk looks possessed this year and poised for going postal in the playoffs this year and that could propel the Mavs deep into the playoffs he is a MVP player and has it in his arsenal to do it.    However, even before the last 2 years the Mavs have had trouble closing in out in the playoffs. Although, the Miami NBA Finals was questionable it did go down in the record books as a Dallas lost series and even before that when they had the combo of Nash and Dirk, a HOF coach in Don Nelson, and All-stars in Michael Finley, Antwan Jamison (6th Man), and Antoine Walker they could not find the d to propel them to the NBA Finals furthest they went was WCF. They also had Nick Van Exel, Josh Howard, Marquis Daniels, etc.    In those years also they almost became the only team in NBA history to lose a series after going up 3-0 as the Portland Trail-Blazers almost made a remarkable rally 3 down tying it only to lose in 7. All these things are indicative for why the Mavs have yet to win the gold, but like I said it is very possible to change that this year.|`|HLzS2z9laa	because they lost as a 67win regular season 1st seed to a 8th seed, arguably the biggest upset in playoff history, so people now days just sleep on them, i agree they are a pretty dangerous team, nobody wants to face them you will never know when they can explode and take over, just like they did in 06 playoffs|`|dB25AQRFaa	since they are incapable and there players dont play like they used to thats why|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	because they fired Avery Johnson!...now look at em'!....they bearly got the 8th spot ?  are we to take Dallas serious after the past 2 years?  i feel more confident  that the Rockets will get past the first round than Dallas........they have alot to prove, and it they can't get past the first round this year, if i was Dirk i'd start trying to find a way to get to a contender before i end up like Barkly, and Malone....lol!|`|2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	their consistent ability to melt down in the face of adversity would be my main point. the fact that inexperienced teams can trounce them (see: Hornets) and that they're barely in the playoffs.     then consider, as an 8th seed. what can they do against the Lakers? really? LA has a superior team at every position, barring the PG.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	The Mavs have a history of underachieving in the playoffs.

J-kidd was a great man to man defender, but he is getting too old to keep pace with the Deron Williams and the Chris Pauls. Josh Howard occasionaly plays defense, but not at a consistent level. that team needs to have some defensive force to make noise in the playoffs.|`|bFCNIwa1aa	BOTH OF U GIRLS ARE UGLY.AND IF YOUR GOING TO SHOW YOUR *** WHERE  A THONG|`|swDLLBZwaa	They suck.|`|kyrfpaIJaa	Simple.
