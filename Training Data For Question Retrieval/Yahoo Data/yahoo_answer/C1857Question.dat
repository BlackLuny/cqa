What brand would you recommend? Acer, ASUS?       Is it easy to watch movies on them? (with an external drive)      If you don't have an external drive, how would you install virus protection and other software?      Would it work ok for basic online browser based games?      I already have a couple of laptops and a desktop so I would not use this for anything more then surfing the web, watching youtube videos, and some very basic online games. I would not like to spend more than $350 (the price of the new Acer aspire one)

Otherwise send it back to them (which they will arrange). What are my options here? Am I entitled to refuse their options and keep the extra cartridge (as it was their mistake). Or is that not legal (in which case I choose one of their options). I would prefer a legal route. Thanks in advanced for all your answers!!

Recently my friend told me to switch to 'Google Chrome', claiming that websites run a lot faster on it than on other browsers. I currently run Safari on my mac and Firefox on my PC. I was wondering if it is true that certain browsers run websites faster than others and if so if there is a reason for this.      Surely how fast you browse the internet should be solely dependent on how fast your internet speed is?      Thanks.

20090203161809AAgAjFv	Computers & Internet;Software	Help with imageres.dll and browseui.dll in windows vista?	Well I'm in a bit of a pickle.  I recently downloaded a theme for deviant art like I normally do.  I decided to install the custom imageres.dll and and browseui.dll files that came with it.  So I went into my system32 and renamed the real browseui.dll to browseui.dll.original and renamed imageres.dll to imageres.dll.original.        The reason I did this is because I'm and idiot and thought this is what your were supposed to do.  I then proceeded  to try and add the custom files to my system32.  The problem is, It says it's moving the file but then it does nothing.  For that matter, I can't move, rename, delete, or change any file in my OS (C:) drive.  It wont let me remove the .original off the files.        It's not doing anything else to my computer as far as I know except messing up my logon screen, but I really would like to fix this.  What should I do?

My question:      What is the worst that could happen if my cord accidentally gets unplugged?     I don't care about losing unsaved things (i.e. Spreadsheets, document, edited vids), I save often,.   I am more worried about my notebook's hardware, are they like desktops? Does abruptly stopping the power not do anything much, or can doing this cause something to mis function?

Ok in this program i need to make so that when components are clicked from a dropdown they change the background color just like the buttons do.   i have started but am not sure how to implement the itemListener... it must be in the style used here, no newer or older versions of java, i kno this is old java.   plz help   ty       Here is the source code that i have so far  http://ermamillerpencilportraits.com/But...     (a) Create a choice component named colors and put it in center(did that)   (b) use add() to populate it with certain colors(did that too)   (c) At the end of Buttons class header, insert a comma, and then type ItemListener to implement the ItemListener. (**i could not get this to work plz help.)   (d) Add an itemListener to the Choice component(i cant get this to work?? :(  ahh  )   (e) Write an itemStateChanged() method to test for each item in the Choice component using header, public void itemStateChanged(ItemEvent ie), and an opening brace. use the same code as you did in the actionPerformed() method to test for the click of each choice.   im guessing they want the color to change also if the choice components are clicked.      if anyone could possibly help me out that would be GREATLY appreciated :)      it must be in the style used here ty
20090304184417AA3StM4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop problems, help?	ok, so I have a tablet pc from hp, its been freezing randomly, so i had to do a hard shut down, then start it up again, and it went into startup repair, that worked a few time, but last friday, I had to reset it to factory settings, this morning it froze again, and now startup repair isn't working, i'll probably reset it to factory conditions again, but can anyone tell me what's wrong/ how to fix it?    i've gone online to all kinds of sites on it, so i think it could be malware, but none of my safety programs (norton & mccaffee) detected anything... I've only had it since christmas, so could I get it repaired under warrenty maybe??? I don't really want to do that though, but as a  last resort....
20090304181301AAAProZ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Diagnosis for my laptop - help anyone?	Hi, and thanks to anyone who can give me some advice here...      My laptop is about 1.5yrs old, hasn't been used much in the last 6/7months because of this problem:      About 6 months ago it developed an issue with games and video. It starts juddering, slowing down and then freezes (the screen doesn't go black or blue or to desktop, or give an error, it just freezes as is) after about 15 minutes of either playing a video or a game. If I close the lid for 15 mins to let it cool down (or sort itself out?) it works again for another 10 mins then does the same thing again.      The spec' is more than fine for doing/playing either, so hardware is not the problem. Plus this issue never happened for the first 9/10 months. Seems to me it's either developed a problem of overheating quickly when using graphics or something's gone awry with the memory allocation?      It does get very hot, but then it always did and I honestly cannot recall whether it got as hot before as it does now.      I'd just like some people's opinions in case there's anything I can do to fix it myself, or try to at least before giving in to taking it to a shop and finding cash that I don't have.      Thanks to all who can give advice or suggestions x

20090304184442AA6mgRq	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Computer takes 10-18 minutes to open programs when first turned on... but after that works fine!?	I am having an extremely frustrating problem with my PC. Every time I start it up (from being completely shut down), it takes FOREVER to allow me to click on and use programs. All of the icons on my desktop pop up reasonably quickly, but the first one I click on always takes at least 10 minutes to open (just now, I waited 18 minutes to open firefox, which is even longer than usual).      After I've managed to get that one initial program to open, everything else on my computer runs and opens at a normal (fairly fast) speed. It's just getting the first program to start up that's the problem!      Now before you answer, I've already done a few things to no avail:    - I defrag regularly    - I've deleted all but the essential programs and documents on my computer (I've got about 40% free space on my hard drive)    - I've done the msconfig thing where you can de-select non-essential things (like itunes, etc) from running on start up      None of these things have made my start up any faster. Right now, my best solution is to never shut my computer down (which works ok, but I dont want to keep doing it since I would rather wait 20 minutes to use my computer than waste all of that electricity). My PC is only about 4 years old (which I know is 'old' in computer terms, but seriously I think it should be working better than this at its age)      Any suggestions?

20090225070826AAQ4URK	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Can I export firefox 3 history (places.sqlite) to either old firefox 2 or another browser?	Hi      I am finding my firefox (3.0.6) is getting slower and slower, often hanging on pages for some time, or not finding pages due to timeout (which do work in IE).  I've tried everything to address this (ran several virus checks, uninstalled everything including settings and then reinstalled, de-fragged hd, checked internet speed is still c8mb, uninstalled add-ons and only reinstalled necessary ones, deleted all cookies etc..).  Through various google searches, others seem to have had the same problem and have found going back to Firefox 2 has helped the problem, so this is my next step to try.      However, the one thing I do need is a record of my browsing history.  (My places.sqlite file is the only thing possibly causing slow down, although I do try and clear it out as much as possible.)          Is it possible to convert my places.sqlite file into a history.date file for doing this?  If this is not possible, do any other browsers accept places.sqlite or some other way to accept an import from ff3?  Can anyone recommend another browser otherwise similar to ff?      Thanks for any thoughts.

Is there something that I can do to make it work      And should I flip the switch in the back of my powersupply from 115 to 225 for it to work or is that a bad idea      Thanks and (10pts best answerer!)

20090304195216AA2Vs6m	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Compaq laptop screen is distorted, please please help?	Ok some guy I know gave me a Sims 2 Apartment Life game for my pc, a desktop. I put the cd in for the game and about 30 minutes into the game the screen goes crazy and these little lines just appear through it, And when I shut down the computer and the game and just like browsed the internet or even typed on my computer after a few minutes the screen does that. I mean I literally can't see anything. I know that the picture or whatever happens to be on the screen at the time is still there because the colors remain but its just so distorted it's not very visible. Ok so I thought it was just a virus from music or something so I put the Sims 2 cd in my new laptop. Well about 30 minnutes into the game, the same thing happened. But on my laptop if I move the screen back and forth the distortion stops for about 10 minutes then it goes back to being distorted. It not only does this when I'm playing the game but when I'm just using my computer, after a few minutes the screen gets all distorted.   Please help me, what could've been wrong with that Sims 2 Apartment Life game.

Okay so I'm just being a tad stupid about this, but I have an older PC I use for basic website building and email. I use my Mac for more advanced projects. However, I have noticed a lag in speed lately and I was wondering if it would be worth my while investing in a new dual core for this basic stuff or just increase the RAM. I'm currently running on 1 GB RAM. I don't want to go out and waste money on something I do not require since my Mac (new 2009) covers pretty much any major memory draining project. Any advice would be great.

I know this is a kinda strange question, but I'm interested in youtube's TOS. I recently reported around 50 videos of people fully mooning cars, other people & cameras, and about half of the ones I reported for nudity were removed. I'm wondering why they choose to ignore some of these videos? Some of the videos they did not remove actually contained full on mooning, which really confuses me as to why they won't remove them. Are the videos considered artistic expression? The great majority of these videos have been up for many years & are listed as comedy. Is youtube ignoring this breaking of their TOS, or did I just get a more conservative staff member who removed some of the vids after I reported?
