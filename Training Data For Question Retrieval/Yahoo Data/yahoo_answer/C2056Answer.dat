SdHqyWKHaa	It's just another form of the requirement that you post your question in the correct category and that it be understandable. If questions aren't comprehensible to users of a site, there's no point to them being there.   Each country's site has a language associated with it, and you must use that language to post on that site. If you want to post a question in French, you must do it on a French-speaking site - France or Quebec. |`|AA11900069	I don't agree.  This is YA, for the UK.  The other YA boards are linked at the bottom of the screen.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	The feeling is that if I can't read the question, why is it posted on a Yahoo! US or UK site?|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Flobadob    There is no such rule.    The U.K. has more than one official language, so it would be inappropriate.  I haven't seen any questions in Welsh, Scots, Gaelic or even oddle poddle.     As long as the questions have relevance to a U.K. & Ireland audience, it shouldn't matter what the language is.  Except for Esperanto which is the language of self-rightous jerks, with too much time on their hands.    http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_...|`|wlTtWFE4aa	yahoo is a rasist natzi corporaton its that simple|`|u6PhC7vhaa	Not technically.

Go on to the French section to speak French! Don't befoul us with it.|`|sDKCX43caa	It is so we who speak English only see English questions. If there was no rule you would never find a question in English.    Click on a flag below if you want to use a foreign language other than English

qP7wUyw7aa	A pyromaniac is an actual condition that causes people to start fires to find some sort of stress relief or release. I don't believe this is the case with an arsonist. Arson is a criminal act where pyromania is a condition.     I have heard that pyromania is caused by an inability to control impulses. So, I guess the answer to the question is pyromaniac; a person who gets satisfaction and feels accomplished after starting a fire. |`|nKymBiZXaa	Pyromaniacs|`|AmMydVTcaa	People who start fires are arsonist.

N?o se sabe ao certo quando ela come?ou a ser usada. Desenhos e gravuras do Antigo Egito j mostravam homens com um envoltrio no pnis. Sua industrializa??o s come?ou em 1939.    O preservativo  mtodo contraceptivo muito antigo, existindo provas da sua utiliza??o em civiliza??es histricas da Antiguidade, como a chinesa, na qual os preservativos eram feitos de papel de seda untado com leo, a egpcia, que utilizava intestinos de animais cozidos, ou ainda a cretense (1600 a.C.), da qual existem relatos acerca do rei Minos de Knossos recorrer a bexigas natatrias de peixes como preservativo.    No sculo XVI o anatomista italiano Gabriel Fallopius recomendava um inc?modo saquinho feito de linho e amarrado com um la?o, que  considerado o primeiro preservativo, provavelmente utilizado para evitar doen?as venreas.     Um sculo depois, um mdico ingls - conhecido como dr. Condom - resolveu criar um protetor feito com tripa de animais para o rei Carlos II de Inglaterra, a fim de evitar o nascimento de tantos filhos ilegtimos (No entanto n?o h qualquer evidncia de que tal mdico tenha realmente existido).     Em 1939, com a descoberta do processo de vulcaniza??o da borracha, os preservativos passaram a ser fabricados com esse material e ficaram elsticos.

GSKbaFybaa	If you want to get more answers to your questions, just post your question in the right category/section and ask an interesting or funny question, you could get a lot of answers from different people.   To get your question to be seen on the opening page of Yahoo! Answers, your question has to be starred by most people.   And I don't think that your questions can disappear, just go back to your profile and look at your open questions, if they are still there, means that your question hasn't been deleted, and is still open. Unless your question might be reported, because it might be inappropriate.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Post your questions at night, and in better known categories. For example, if you're question is about cars, don't put the question in the Car Make >>> Acura section; instead, put it in the General - Cars & Transportation (or Other) section. That way, you'll get more answers. Whatever you do, try not to post it in Polls & Surveys, because you could get reported for placing the question in the wrong category. I hope I've helped. Good luck! =)

All I do is base this on my own common sense.

There is a 5-point deduction for each question you ask.  You'll do better gaining points if you ask less on the earlier levels. Give quality answers to real questions to get Best Answer points (10). Vote undecided questions and answer your daily limit when you can (1 pt ea.). And ask few questions (-5), but when you do ask, be sure to choose a Best Answer, as you get 3 points back for that. Click on the link below (or your points or level number next to your avatar). How to move up levels and the whole scoring process is all explained there.    So unless you really have a problem you need help with, hold off on asking so many questions, be sure to stay within the rules, and answer more.      Again, be sure to choose Best Answers to the questions you have open for that 3 points:    Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.

ycwpFNWFaa	I'm feel bad that you had to go through that, but, no you are not the only one.     There have been many other users on Yahoo! that have had the misfortune of getting the RRoD on their xbox 360 and then after they sent it to Microsoft and got it fixed, They got the RRoD again, and had to re-send it back. Extended 3yr warranty and free shipping doesn't cover the mental anguish of not having your xbox 360 to play with for several weeks, plus the fact that you somehow feel that you have just invested in an lesser product. :((  Microsoft really screw up their Public relations with the overheating issue/RROD. http://www.answers.yahoo.com/search/sear...    My advice is to send back the system and have them fix the DVD drive or sell the system off/trade into the game store.

uWRrbyQMaa	I have IE and F11 is the key that works for me.  There is another way you can fix it.  Maybe it will work for you.  You are in full screen mode.  Hover your cursor over the top of your screen to see your toolbars.

o3sYIdOzaa	Here is what I found on the Secret Service site:    "If you ever receive an e-mail or fax from someone you do not know requesting your assistance in a financial transaction, such as the transfer of a large sum of money into an account, or claiming you are the next of kin to an wealthy person who has died, or the winner of some obscure lottery, DO NOT respond. These requests are typically sent through public servers via a generic "spammed" e-mail message. Usually, the sender does not yet know your personal e-mail address and is depending on you to respond. Once you reply, whether you intend to string them along or tell them you are not interested, they will often continue to e-mail you in an attempt to harass or intimidate you. If you receive an unsolicited e-mail of this nature, the best course is to simply delete the message.    Due to a number of aggravating circumstances, such as the use of false names, addresses, stolen/cloned/prepaid cell phones and remote email addresses, verifying the location of and subsequent prosecution of these persons or groups is difficult. The act of sending an email soliciting strangers' assistance in a financial transaction is not, in itself, a crime. The installation of a credible spam filter and contacting your Internet Service Provider may help deter these unsolicited emails. However, there is currently no available program to completely block these types of messages.    The perpetrators of advance fee fraud, known internationally as "4-1-9 fraud" (after the section of the Nigerian penal code which addresses these schemes), are often very creative and innovative. A large number of victims are enticed into believing they have been singled out from the masses to share in multi-million dollar windfall profits for no apparent reason.    If you have suffered a significant financial loss related to advance fee fraud, please contact your local Secret Service field office. Telephone numbers are available in the Field Office Directory on this website or may also be found on the inside cover of your local telephone directory. Any investigation regarding this type of fraud will be conducted on a case by case basis at the discretion of the local Secret Service and U.S. Attorney's Office."|`|AA11252878	Here are some places you can report scam messages:  In the event scam messages that came from Y!

The problem is that 360 is no longer being developed/supported so it has lots of glitches, and your picture may take several days to appear here if you're not lucky.     Having said that, here's the step-by-step guide:    1) In order to do this, you need to have a Yahoo! 360 page, because that is where you will upload your picture.  If you don't have a 360 page, go to the Yahoo! 360 Home page and start one. You don't need to actually fill all the sections or provide any information if you don't plan to use the blog and other features.    2) In your 360 "My page" tab, the top box in the left column shows your personal image or avatar. Click on the "Edit personal photos" link.    3) In the next screen, Personal Photos, you can upload up to four images. Upload the pic you want to use in Yahoo!Answers, and make sure you check the "Set as primary" option next to it.     4) Click on "Save".    5) Now you should see your selected picture as your default 360 personal image.    6) Back in your Yahoo!Answers profile,  select "Use my Yahoo! 360 picture".

QEEweJUaaa	(Portrayal of Women in Antigone)                Although ancient Greece was a male-dominate society, Sophocles' work Antigone, portrays women as being strong and capable of making wise decisions. In this famous tragedy, Sophocles uses the characters Ismene and Antigone to show the different characteristics and roles that woman are typical of interpreting. Traditionally women are characterized as weak and subordinate and Ismene is portrayed in this way. Through the character of Antigone, women finally get to present realistic viewpoints about their character.     The sexist stereotypes presented in this tragedy address many perspectives of men at this time. Creon the arrogant and tyrant leader is, the very character that exemplifies this viewpoint. Antigone's spirit is filled with bravery, passion and fury; which allow her to symbolize the very essence of women. She is strong enough to do what her conscious tells her despite the laws of the land. Many examples in the play prove that Antigone's character is very capable of making her own decisions in the name of justice. First, Antigone opposes Creon's law and buries her slain brother; because in her mind it was immoral not to. She does this because she is compassionate and loves her brother very much. Creon, however, believes that his laws must be upheld and would do anything to prevent any type rebelling. He is even more infuriated when he learns that a woman has broken his laws. He tries to show Antigone who's in charge by sentencing her to a life of imprisonment. Secondly, Antigone shows how determined she is by accepting her consequences with pride. She does not try to hide that she is responsible for breaking Creon's laws, moreover, she takes all the credit. All the while she maintains her strength because she truly believes in her actions. These sorts of actions ultimately prove that Antigone is courageous and willing to stand up to men, which was completely against the norm at this time. Her spirit refuses to submit to the role of a helpless woman like her sister Ismene's character does.     Ismene is a coward and refuses to help her sister because she feared men. This fear propels her to turn her head to the disrespect that is been shown to her brother, Polyneices. Her character is a close representation of the viewpoints of the male gender regarding women. She is subordinate and weak-willed. She refuses to stand up to Creon even though in her heart she knows that his laws are morally wrong. This type of demeanor in famous works of art is very common for women to behave like, according to the position of men. Ismene proclaims, "We are only women, we cannot fight with men, Antigone!" (Sophocles, pg.187) Proving that she is unwilling to do the right thing if it means standing up to a man. Another example of how spineless Ismene is portrayed is when she tries to take credit for burying her brother with Antigone. She is so scared that she will be left all alone with out Antigone that she is willing to die with her. Creon demonstrates his lack of respect for women again when he tries to accuse Ismene of aiding Antigone. Then when he realizes she had no part in the crime does he describes her as, "....she never had a mind at all." (Sophocles, pg.208) The play is also filled with instances of a sexist male viewpoint. Creon is the leader of the Theben throne a position he highly regards. He believes that he has a divine rule and therefor his laws are just and fair. He rules the kingdom with an iron fist and demonstrates his prejudices towards women throughout the play. First, Creon is so upset that his laws are broken by Antigone that tries to hurt her as much as possible. He tries to act as prideful as possible, he states, "No woman shall seduce us. If we must lose, Let's lose to a man, at least. Is a woman stronger than we?" (Sophocles,pg.212) This is proof that Creon does not see women as equal to the authority of men. He feels that women have no common sense and, therefor, must be punished for their irrationality. He eventually realizes that he has offended the Gods with his actions as ruler of Thebes. It is not until his own wife kills herself because of his tyranny against humanity does he realize his mistakes. This of course is way too late to redeem his lost loved ones or take back his contempt toward women.      The Greek tragedy Antigone by Sophocles is one of the first dramatic plays that demonstrates the different roles women play in society. The two sisters Ismene and Antigone portray major female characteristics. While Antigone plays the role of a strong and sensible woman, Ismene portrays the typical meek and mild role. The character of Creon demonstrates through his tyrant rule, the sexist male viewpoint of the ancient Greek world. This play proves that gender difference has always been present in society.|`|hfE8eCktaa	Look for info in these:  When comparing power levels and womens rights, Sparta was a leader in its time.  Athens and Sparta, though both Greek city-states were different in the way they operated.  More specifically, Sparta was different in the way that they treated their women.  Athenian woman were treated quite appallingly compare to the standards of todays women.  The stem of this difference seems to lie in how these two city-states were governed.  Sparta, known for its militaristic ways, was an oligarchy and Athens, known for its philosophers and thinkers, was a democracy.  Spartas oligarchy was ruled by a counsel of 5 men, on being a lawmaker or giver.  The lawgivers name was Lycurgus.  Lycurgus was known for his warden-like ways in the training of men for war, but also for his equivalence in the rights of Spartan women.  It has been speculated that womens equality to men sprung from stories of the Amazons [, warrior women of the Bronze Age, position and bravery] in the Trojan War (Who were the Amazons?).  Athens, on the other hand, was a democracy that acted with the voice of the people through the Senate and the Roman Council.  It was not surprising then that women were so highly kept and protected.  It has been said the belief of the Athenian man was that women werehighly sexual beings who could not control their sexual urges and therefore had to be restricted for their own benefit. (Graham)  It should come as no surprise how they were treated, then.  One of the great literary men of Athens, Euripides, has proclaimed in his book, Meda, If only children could be gotten some other way with the female sex!  If women didnt exist, human life would b e free of all its miseries. (Graham)  Unfortunately, Euripides shared the mindset of the Athenian man.  Where politics, in the way, of having a vote seemed off limits to any Greek woman and childbearing was their number one purpose, the women of these two city-states had some very blatant differences.  The paragraphs below will illuminate some of these.         When getting down to the specific differences, one must consider all aspects of a womans daily life.  It must be considered how they were taught, what their responsibilities were in the Greek home and what rights if any were held.         By far, the worst case scenario was that of the Athenian woman.  By the 5th century BC, Athenian women were barely considered to be better than slaves.  They were generally not taught to read or write and were not expected to be educated.  Women prior to the 7th century BC were thought to have been subject to similar rites of passage as boys (The Women of Athens).   An Athenian woman was not allowed out of the home.  After the 7th century BC and Pericles Law on the legitimacy of marriage, womens rights took a large decline from their already horrible state.  They were expected to command the running of the house by the slaves and bear lots of children. The number of slaves a family had determined what work a woman was allowed to do. There were three classes of woman:  slave women (carried out domestic chores and were nannies to the woman of the houses children), Athenian citizen women, and Hetaerae (considered prostitutes though were allowed education and to visit the Agora or marketplace).  The only women that had any rights in Athens were the Concubines or hetaerae whom were considered the prostitutes.  They could move freely through society; however it was noted that they were highly exploited.  They could develop relationships with their male companions and have children, but their children were illegitimate and, therefore, not citizens of Athens. It was stated, though, that citizen wives and daughters were protected, but the prostitutes or pornoi were open to all forms of sexual exploitation [and] were maintained by men, or worked in brothels and on the streets. (Graham) The most important purpose of Athenian women was to be used as bargaining chips in arranged marriages which the father of the bride was in charge of.  This was because of the large dowry that was given to the groom but kept by the fathers brother.  Fathers would marry off their young teenage daughter to men in their 30s. They were not allowed to meet their new groom until a contract had been agreed upon.  Even then, the bride would not become a full member of her new family until the first healthy child was born.  If the child survived mortality, the husband would decide if the baby would be kept.  If he accepted it, it would live, but if he refused it, it would die (Graham) by placing the child in a clay pot outside the home or by the roadside.  The wifes child would be denied if it were unhealthy or deformed or even of the wrong sex (Graham).  Female children were often considered inferior to male children.  The fathers brother was responsible for finding the bride a new husband if she was widowed.  If he was dead, then the woman became a virtual slave (The Wom

tqAEoOAdaa	To STOP receiving unwanted (Spam/Bulk/Junk) email, do the following:    Log into your Email, go to Options (upper right hand side). Go through all your settings and don't forget to save them too. (http://spam-blocking.cn/top-7-ways-to-st...  )    Under Spam Protection, make sure your Spam Guard is turned ON. Option to immediately delete all Spam messages. This will force all new email to redirect to your Inbox. Option to Block messages that you mark as Spam. If you plan on keeping your   Bulk folder, also option messages you mark as Not-Spam to be moved to your Inbox. Always Option to Block all Images until you can look them over first. This prevents spammers from knowing you opened their email. Save Changes.     http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/comput...    Under Blocked Addresses, type in spammer.com, this will stop all Spam that has been reported to Yahoo from ever entering your email. I recommend you remove everything on your list first. This will give you a fresh start after you type in the "spammer.com".   http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/de...    Under General Preferences, Folders/Search Results, Special Folders, option to redirect incoming unsolicited email to the Bulk Folder. Save.     http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...    If you get email from someone you don't know, NEVER open it (it may contain viruses) and report it as SPAM. This will automatically block it from your email account. When you do open an email that is Spam, you have alerted the sender that your account is Active. (http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...  )    This will immediately stop all the Junk Mail considerably. I only get maybe one or two Spam emails a Month. Remember, anytime you give out your email address over the Internet, you can expect to receive some kind of Spam, unless you have made sure that site is secured. (http://help.yahoo.com/tutorials/cg/mail/...  )    To Block an E-mail Address:-    If you are using Yahoo Classic:    Go to "Options" (It is above your E-mail) >Click on "Mail Options">Click on "Blocked Addresses". Enter the address you want to block>Click on Add Block>Click on Save    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/cl...

ycwpFNWFaa	You are not the only one many other xbox users are having the same problem.     For starters  it's a 1.40 GB download. That's a LOT of data.    Secondly, this is H A L O !!! A lot of people are probably downloading it right now just like you. A crowded server means slower download times. Too many people downloading may even have crashed the server.    Lastly, if your internet connection is not great or super highspeed. You're downloading time will take even longer.  .   Right now, it is being downloaded on my brother's xbox (nighttime is usually a better time to download demos and stuff). I'll let you know if he has trouble and it hangs at 37% or not.    Just be patient and let the xbox 360 do it thing. Even if the download looks like it has stop or stalled, it's not the xbox 360 problem or a corrupt file. The problem is at the Xbox LIVE server that is giving out the demo being full and overloaded with requests.

If all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out. Hope this helps.
9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo's answer to thi is as follows. Here are a few areas to consider:  Have you noticed anything unusual that might suggest to you that someone else is using your account? If so, change your password on the Account Info page. Youll be asked to sign in before proceeding.   In the first section of the page, click Change Password and follow the instructions.   Did you send or receive many attachments in a short period of time? If so, try deleting some of the emails you sent or received in a short period of time in your Inbox or Sent folder.   Clear your browsers cache and cookies.   During the suspension, you have access to all email in your Inbox, personal folders and Sent folder, and to your Mail Options. You will not be able to send or receive mail or save any drafts. Email sent to your account will bounce back to the sender.

Or do a PC search to see whether or not you still have the old AIM. If not, then do a Windows explorer search to see if you still have the poem in your computer. If your computer hasn't crashed since you put the poem in the hard drive, it would be there. If not, then try the USB thumb drives you have and search there. If you have backed up your documents on the USB drive, then it would be there. Hope this helps.
