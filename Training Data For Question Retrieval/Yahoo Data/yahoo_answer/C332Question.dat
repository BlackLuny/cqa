I'm the kind of person that hates remakes, I hate the Omen remake followed by the Halloween remake. Now, when I seen the previews for this movie I was like oh god here comes another failure. When I came out of the theater, I thought it was actually pretty good for a remake. It had horror, things popping out at you, humor, etc. What do you think? If you hated it please don't be afraid to state your opinion   :D

"Well" says the teacher very annoyed now, "If your mom was stupid and your dad was a moron, what would that make you?"   Janie smiled and says.......................................

I have quite a few songs that i have made on my own but i have been getting like an artist's block. I suck at mixing, i use Pro Tools but there is just so much work that i get over whelmed and i just want to move on to my next song. is there anyone who i can send my Pro Tools files of my songs too or just some of my mp3's to and they can help me in mixing, or give me ideas? Im not trying to get all big and famous, i just love music so much and want to make some clear tunes, not scratchy you know?

20090227125628AArc3iL	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Bosses spying on private affairs, should there be legislation?	If any one randomly stalked you via your social networking sites and you found out then you could take legal measures against them. Unless that is, your stalker is your boss or a senior work colleague.      Why are bosses allowed to snoop on private affairs via the internet?   If your boss followed you to the pub with the intention of eaves dropping on private gossip and after work venting, you could probably sue if this led to job loss.      If your boss discovers one of your social networking sights even though he/she has not been invited, then snoops on private chit chat and idle thinking and this leads to job loss, shouldn't you also be able to take legal measures? Isn't this stalking?         What are your opinions?

First, while a drunk woman riding a lawn mower is pretty cool, it really does slow down traffic.  Second, did she really need to beat that guy up in the guitar store when all he was trying to do was help her.  Third, and maybe worst of all, she wastes perfectly good beer on the newlyweds car.  I do not drink beer but I bet someone could have made much better use ot it.  I mean, she could at least set the car on fire afterward.  I also think those black bars that show after she drops her coat are pretty damn annoying.  I think that is pretty much it.  Comments?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bNDr1A6d...

20090227150526AAFaLkV	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Pro-lifers: Can you answer these questions?	Do you eat meat? Meat is murder because you killed an actual living, breathing animal so you could disgusting and eat it. If you're so pissy about abortion being murder then why don't you get just as b!!tchy about meat? Doesn't make sense at all..      Also, can you point out where in the bible it says abortion is bad? If you can then why should your beliefs be forced on me? Wouldn't this make you like the Taliban?      If the fetus is alive then is an egg alive? If I crack open an egg does that look like a living chicken to you? No because it's not.      If a fetus it 100% dependent on it's mother for i believe the first 24 weeks then how is this alive? It's just a thing apart of a woman's uterus.      What would the world population be if abortion was illegal in every country? Over 7 or 8 billion? how would we feed all these people? We can't even feed the people we have now.      Don't pull the whole "what if you're mom had an abortion" thing.. My answer will be I wouldn't care if she did because I would have never existed just like I would have never existed if my mom didn't do it the second she did or if another sperm made it to her egg.      I don't expect to get good answers because you people are too closed minded to think. I just wanted to see if you actually form a valid argument?

20090227135554AAvhmmi	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Driven nothing but old cars...did your parents get you a brand new car?	I got my license in '02, and since then, I've driven nothing but old cars (with the exception of the driver's ed car, lol).  First, I drove an '88 Honda Accord, then a '92 Dodge Caravan (still driving it today), and my Dad is about to give me his "pimpmobile" ('93 Buick Le Sabre).  I'm starting to think I'll never get to drive a brand new model car!!!  (Well, maybe once I land a full-time career...who knows).  Now, I've heard of 'spoiled' teenagers whose parents get them a new car as a graduation or birthday gift or something.  I'm NOT going to ask my parents to just buy me a new car because I have done nothing to "deserve" it and they didn't get my brothers brand new cars and they are in the real world working.  So, who here is/was lucky enough to have their parents get them a brand-new car?  Or, I could ask the other question....who didn't have their own car when they got their license?

20090227154954AAiMY01	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What are your opinions about actress Angelina Jolie?	I ask this because this afternoon, I saw a biography about her.   I must admit I y used to blindly hate her, probably it was the result of envy...but seeing this program today, both cons and pros presented by people whose interest she's become I saw something different than what I had harshly judged her to be..and only!   I saw a talented actress, with an interest in world affairs, an ambassador, a good mother, a very good and protective mother, an obviously beautiful woman of quiet grace, a very intelligent person - who does not really care what other people, including me had deemed of her so prematurely.   I admire her determination and strength, her extreme complexity, her introspection, her determination to be her own person no matter what!   I believe she does enjoy a certain mischievousness through which she shocks!!! But is that not also Ms. Jolie?   To me it is no wonder men fall in love with her...even Pitt who'd been married  to Ms. Anniston..But I can help admire her strong sense of  autonomy and independence, not as just a woman, but as a person!   Realizing that these qualities I admire set her up for a Puritanical stone throwing, she most definitely knows in her heart, gut, and heart, she must defend them, if she is true to herself.      I'd be very interested in what you think, since I thought so critically of her, then began to study a tremendous complexity and complicatedness in the person; Angelina Jolie.      I thank you for any responses...no thumbs down...but please no profanity.   Thank you.

20090227161256AA8bInN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Rude sales person in iMac store...as soon as I walked in and he saw the headphones in my hand, he was rude!?	before I even said a word? Ackkkkkkk!  The guy is so lucky I didn't cut loose my temper with him.  I rarely get mad, am easy going and polite.  I was polite and talked to another person in the store.  But this one guy saw me coming into the Mac store to return my headphones because they were defective and loud noises were coming from them when I wore them and they rubbed against my clothes...almost like a stethoscope would sound.  They were really bad.  As soon as I walked in the Mac Store he comes over to me and rudely said, "You can't bring headphones back!"  Now mind you I bought this iPod and extra accesories just last week.  So anyway, with the help of a polite young man that worked at the store, he let me exchange them.  By the time I got home, I was kind of ticked off and called the Mac store and filed a complaint with the manager of the store.  I think that people who work in stores should be polite and not jump to conclusions about why I was bringing the headphones back before I said a word...he saw the headphones in my hand.  We do not have to deal with rude people when we spend so much money in their store.  It would have been different if I had gone in their angry an complaining.  I wasn't.  I just wanted a set of headphones that worked.  I hate being rude to people and I do not like being treated rudely.

A dream about becoming something one day and after you thought you had done everything possible to achieve that dream, it never happens.

I know that it is not a likely career to succeed in but I honestly know what it takes and I have what it takes with a very good start.  Has anyone ever had a dream of becoming something then ended up doing something completely different with their lives?  How does it make you feel about that dream you always had?  Does it make you want it more?  Do you think you did everything possible to make that dream become reality?        Thanks

20090227154652AAnIySH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Happy Friday R&P! Question (+ rant) for influential rock (especially Nirvana) fans?	Today at the doctors office i was waiting and picked up a magazine called "Fashion Rocks". I flip a few pages and their is Chris Cornell....in a phone advertisement (I didn't stick my gum on his face BTW, that magazine is not my property so that would be wrong.) But If I where to do that it would be because I love soundgarden, yes because i love them. I think it sucks that Chris went from being who he was in soundgarden/temple of the dog to being a justin timberlake wanna be. I kept flipping though and i saw two models in a Nirvana shirt and flannels. I kept flipping though and their was an article about Kurt Cobain, remember this is a fashion magazine.      Obviously Kurt would have hated being in a fashion magazine. Just like he would have hated people making converses inspired by him or a movie. So that pissed me off.      So my question to you is do your favorite bands ever get exploited by the advertising industry or in general? I see tons of kids wearing Led Zeppelin,Nirvana, The Ramones, or Pink Floyd shirts who don't even listen to them. When you see your favorite bands being exploited, especially because they are no longer around so they cant defend themselves how do you react?

OK, before I say who it is...please don't answer if it's going to be rude.   It won't hurt my feelings, it will just waste your time.      I'm going to see Britney in the ATL next week with 8 other girls.  We have been fans for 10 years and we are so excited to go and party it up.  We wanted to make a poster showing how long we've been fans and have a couple pics of us in her hometown and various other Britney stuff. We have been trying to come up with something catchy to say on the poster that is Britney related.  Any ideas?    I know they will try to take the poster, but we've got that covered already. So if you can think of something LEGITIMATE (no head shaving, K-Fed...etc comments please) and catchy I'd love to hear it.

20090227161252AAe2Vs6	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	To Pounder On........?	A young boy went up to his father and asked him,    "Dad, what is the difference between potentially and realistically?"    The father thought for a moment, then answered,    "Go ask your mother if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars.    Then ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars,    and then, ask your brother if he'd sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars.    Come back and tell me what you learn from that."       So the boy went to his mother and asked,    "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"    The mother replied,    "Of course I would! We could really use that money to fix up the    house and send you kids to a great University!"       The boy then went to his sister and asked,    "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"    The girl replied,    "Oh my God! I LOVE Brad Pitt I would sleep with him in a heartbeat,    are you nuts?!?!?!"       The boy then went to his brother! and asked,    "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"    "Of course," the brother replied. "Do you know how much a million bucks    would buy?"       The boy pondered the answers for a few days then went back to his dad.    His father asked him,    "Did you find out the difference between potentially and realistically?"    The boy replied,    "Yes..potentially, you and I are sitting on three million dollars..............    but realistically,......    we're living with two sluts and a queer

20090227160237AAbnR8t	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Are 13-year-old girls really this ignorant?	As of last year, 200,000 jobs are lost in America every month.  The average American family brings home less than $36,000 every year.  Last year, there were 80 million unpaid credit cards in the US alone.      And yet, box office analysts predict that the Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Movie will make at least $30 million on opening weekend alone.  This fact makes me want to cry.      To tell you the truth, I would normally have nothing against the Jonas Brothers; they're just another boy band that will go out of style by this time next year.  Unlike other famous boy bands (i.e. the Beatles), the Jonas Brothers will contribute nothing to music history, and will be another flash in the pan.  So why am I making this anti-fanboy rant?      Because the Jonas Brothers are absolutely SELLING OUT, both figuratively and literally!!  Not only will every single movie theater be infested with prissy and downright annoying teenage girls this weekend, but fantastic films like Coraline and Slumdog Millionaire will be thrown off to the side to make room for this epic waste of time and money.      Also, did you know tickets for this monstrosity are $15?  I can understand that 3-D films cost more than regular movies, but why do you need to have THE JONAS BROTHERS IN 3D??!!  This is possibly the stupidest idea ever, especially considering that Disney could be making more money by releasing it in conventional theaters, not that anyone should blow their money on this anyway.      Plus, when My Bloody Valentine came out, tickets for a 3D showing were only an extra $2.50!!  And in that case, you could see an 100-minute movie in eye-popping 3D for little extra cost, whereas this Jonas abomination is an hour-long concert that costs twice as much as an average movie ticket!  Artist Bruce Springsteen recently boycotted Ticketmaster when they started selling tickets to his concert for much more money than the regular price.  If the Jonas Brothers had any class, they would lower ticket prices to prove to fans that they weren't money-grubbing posers.      In conclusion, this concert film is nothing but a cheap gimmick to get port-o-dummy teenage girls to waste their parent's hard-earned money on something they could find on YouTube for no cost!  If you disagree with me, that's fine.  Just realize that in a couple years, you will be laughing to yourself, wondering why you obsessed over THESE guys/girls/unknown!!

20090227180527AAZBtaH	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The psychology of Batman: Dark Knight?	I thought it was really interesting when the Joker rigged two cruise ships with bombs, one full of convicts and the other full of citizens, and gave each ship the detonator to the other vessel and said that if one ship didn't blow up the other by midnight then he would blow them both up. That one black felon with tattoos on his neck and head was cold staring at the guards, and everyone was tempted to blow the other boat up but everyone was nervous on whether or not to do it. So the felon gets up and walks over to the guard and he's like a foot taller than him, the guard just looks up at him, and the felon says, "give me the detonator so I can do what you should have done 10 minutes ago." Then he throws it out the window instead of blowing up the other ship, and the viewer is left with the realization that all of the bad things that they imagined are a product of their own mind and didn't reflect the characters actual motives or actions. I wonder if there is a name for this as a literary or cinematographer device?      This isn't really even a question, I just wanted to put this out there and see what other people thought about it, any opinions or feedback would be appreciated.

20090429183432AAx9IDC	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Is it just me, or are the Jonas Brothers getting WORSE?!?	Ok. When I first saw the Jonas Brothers on TV singing SOS at the AMAs in 2007, I was really impressed, but they kinda got worse from when I saw them on Oprah to some scenes on Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream. I thought, "Every time you blunder, it can only go up from here right?" Well in their case...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axMIYkhbA...  ...not really (If any of you have a YouTube account, please rate this video with 1 star or less). NOW, with JONAS coming out, they have a song called Pizza Girl. I think that that was their worst song EVER! They have fallen WAAAAAAAAY below my expectations now. HOWEVER, the only time I recommend a concert would probably be in December (Trust me, they're always good during December). Any other time, the only time they do good is if they get lucky. My grade for them is about a D- ever since hearing Pizza Girl. They're nice guys, but they are getting MUCH worse. What do you think? Are the Jonas Brothers getting worse?

20090227162614AAqGCe7	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Can you guess our signs?	Can you guess my boyfriend's and my sign?      Little things that wouldn't annoy me make him really, really angry. Like losing a video game or that there's no food in the house. When he gets into a rage over stuff like this, I sit quietly and wait for opportune moments to offer helpful suggestions - like what food to make. I'll help him make it, but I won't make it for him. He needs to learn and I'm not one to help those who won't help themselves. He'll randomly bring up my ex-"crush" and say little things like "Why don't you get [crush] to help you?" Him doing this doesn't really bother me, but I'd rather him just be upfront about it and tell me that he's jealous if he is, why play games? When he gets mad about something, he becomes enraged and he is the king of the cold shoulder. Sometimes I don't understand his need to remain silent if he's angry about something. I think if there's an issue, we should discuss it and resolve it, I don't like waiting around for him to "cool off". Other than that, I love that he can express his love for me without hesitating (only when we're alone though) in a way that I would never think I could repeat to someone else before I met him.       Can you guess?

20061212131532AAoZ7Vu	Entertainment & Music;Music	Bass amp question...?	This question is for those electricians/musicians. I just got a new Behringer Ultrabass amp head that is rated at 450 watts. Currently, I have only two Crate cabinets rated at 200 watts each and a PA cabinet rated at 350. The Behringer manual states that my cabinets should have a sufficient power rating and a 4 ohm impedance (the Crates are capable of 8), and that too high a load impedance will decrease the output power rating of the power stage...      I didn't get a chance to study electronics in high school. So anyone who can put this into English and offer a solution to my problem gets 10 points. I'm thinking of just plugging in the amp to the two Crates at 8 ohms and not turning up the volume very much. Any other solutions?

20070217015647AAJzDdW	Entertainment & Music;Music	What classical song has the same tune as the background beat of The Verve Bittersweet Sympony. anyone know it?	I have heard the song before but never knew what orchestra plays the song. I recently came across Bittersweet Symphony and it's really similar to the background beat for that song. I did some research and found out all the legal matters with The Stones and the  Andrew Oldham Orchestra. Wikipedia has samples of both songs and neither are what im looking for. I also came across a forum where somebody stated the song is a ripoff from a classical song, so that supports my thought that there is a song out there that sounds similar. theres also a techno remix with the same beat, a friend gave it to me and it was titled Water Rave but i doubt  it's the actual song name. anyways, please help me if you know what im talking about.

And I liked the first series and some of the series after that. But now I'm getting to the point where I'm thinking 'how many more?' I mean it's just getting reptitive. That and there are so many pokemon now it's hard to keep track. I liked when there were only 150-250 to remember, now there's tons!       Also, I didn't care much for Ash's voice change and never getting to see Misty again. It would have been fun to see how she's doing      So, what do you think?
20090225102622AAokDpr	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	DJ Premier question.......?	As we all know, Premo has blessed many well known artists such as Nas, Biggie and Jay Z (to name a few) with a few classic beats, but he's produced full length albums for lesser known artists such as Group Home and Jeru the Damaja.  Why didn't Premo ever produce a full length album for some of the well known artists?  Do you think it was by choice of the artist or by Premo?  Do you think the artist wanted more of a variety in their production, or was it a budget issue?  If it was a budget issue, I'm not sure how Lil Dap and Jeru would be able to afford it, unless Premo hooked them up.  To me, Premo's tracks were the best ones on Biggie, Jay Z and Nas' albums aside from Illmatic.  I feel like I Am, Life After Death, or even Bluprint 2 could have been much better with Premo doing all of the beats.  Or I would have love to have seen KRS One, OC or Mos Def hook up with Premo for a full album.  I think they would be guaranteed classics.  What are your thoughts?

And I got to say I usually agree       There are movies that put me into hysterics time and time again but I can't bring myself to put them on the same list.      A 'B' list if you will      A recent example is Get Smart    Myself and everyone I know thought it was hilarious but found something forgettable about it, and doubt it will stand the test of time      some more form my list are   The Hot Chick   Stealing Harvard   Where's Papa      I realize average is a subjective term   And suggesting comedies that are in your opinion too unique to be average but still 'B list' caliber is more than fine    Just trying to get recognition to under appreciated films

20070710012552AApdkM1	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	<<<R<i<f<f<a<!<<<<<<<<BAAAAAAA…	Una volta, una tribù di cannibali aveva imprigionato alcuni uomini. Il capo di questa tribù, colto da un attacco di bontà, concede la libertà ai prigionieri a patto che loro gli portassero 4 frutti uguali che avrebbero colto nel territorio circostante.    Il primo dei prigionieri, dopo una lunga ricerca, torna alla tribù con quattro banane e chiede al capo la libertà promessa. Ma il capo dei cannibali non era soddisfatto, quindi impose al prigioniero di infilarsi le 4 banane su per il sedere senza ridere. Ma il prigioniero scoppia a ridere, di conseguenza viene ucciso.   Poco dopo sopraggiunge il secondo prigioniero con 4 arance, ma anche lui si mette a ridere e viene ucciso.   Il giorno dopo arriva il terzo con 4 bacche. Anche lui tenta di conquistarsi la libertà, ma una volta infilata la terza bacca scoppia  a ridere e viene ucciso.   I tre prigionieri uccisi si incontrano in paradiso, e quello delle banane chiede all'ultimo arrivato: _Posso capire che io non sia riuscito ad infilarmi le mie 4 banane senza ridere, ma tu come hai potuto fallire con 4 misere bacche?!?   E la risposta fu:_Ce l'avrei fatta,...se non avessi visto un altro prigioniero che arrivava con 4 meloni...!
20070711040116AAxTadC	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	< 	Una famiglia di coniglietti (lui, lei e una serie notevole di coniglietti tutti bianchi, tranne uno che aveva la punta di un orecchio nera) viveva felice nel bosco. Disse papà coniglio:    - Anche se non è tutto bianco è pur sempre nostro figlio e gli vorremo bene lo stesso!!!    Ma quella punta di orecchia nera lo faceva diverso agli occhi dei fratelli che lo prendevano in giro. Il fatto comportò qualche problema di autostima nel povero coniglio. Girovagando solo soletto nella campagna un giorno incrociò la ferrovia e un treno che passava. Allora ebbe un'idea geniale e semplice. Mentre passava il treno lui avrebbe messo la sua orecchietta su un binario e il treno gli avrebbe portato via quell'odiosa macchia nera. Appena vide il treno poggiò l'orecchietta sul binario. Non aveva paura: sarebbe diventato anche lui tutto bianco. Ma purtroppo sbagliò i calcoli e -ZAC- il treno gli tranciò di netto la testa!    MORALE: E' facile perdere la testa per un triangolino di pelo nero.

Incuriosito il carabiniere gli chiede: "Ma cosa fai? Getti via le mele?".   L'uomo del camion sicuro di se' : "Certo! Ma lei non lo sa che i semi delle mele sviluppano l'intelligenza!?".   Il carabiniere sempre piu' incuriosito gli chiede: "E che cosa ne fa dei semi? Li vende?".   E l'uomo: "Certamente!".   "E quanto costano?".   "5000 lire l'uno!".   " Ok! Voglio provarli: me ne dia tre".   L'uomo prende le 15.000 lire dal carabiniere e consegna i tre semi.   Il carabiniere se li mangia e poi pensa ad alta voce: "Cavolo! Ma con 15.000 lire mi compravo 15 kg di mele, le sbucciavo ed avevo molti piu' semi".   E l'uomo "Vede gia' e' diventato piu' intelligente di prima !".   E il carabiniere: "Cavolo, ha ragione me ne dia altri tre".

Im not trying to get all big and famous, i just love music so much and want to make some clear tunes, not scratchy you know? I just dont want anyone to take any of my songs, so i would probably like a signed agreement, but it could be something like how Postal Service worked. one guy made the beats and mailed them to the other artist who then put the lyrics in etc.., lol, myabe something like that. thanks

But being a skeptical and analytical person by nature, I was wondering if he really was writing down the answers even before I gave them. As soon as I gave an answer, he would show me his notepad with the exact same answer!    This man does not advertise about himself, does not charge too much, and does not try to convince you to come back to him. So he seems genuine. But could anyone please confirm if he really doesnt jot down the answers as you tell him? Im feeling very bad, coz Im going through a rough time and have come across many fake psychics.

Ieri si è spento uno dei piu grandi caratteristi del cinema Italiano, Guido Nicheli, meglio conosciuto come IL ZAMPETTI, o piu semplicemente IL CUMENDA. Sebbene interpretasse sempre lo stesso ruolo, e rappresentasse più che altro una macchietta gli ero molto affezionato e la notizia della sua scomparsa mi ha sconvolto. Credo che grazie ai suoi personaggi abbia contribuito a rendere i milanesi un po piu simpatici (o sbaglio?).
