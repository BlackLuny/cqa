He wants a memorable tattoo for his deceased grandmonth (RIP) that says "Josephine" on the top of his hand with a heart so he will always remember her, he truely misses her. As a back up plan he wants a computer tattooed on his bicep because hes really into that stuff. I have a friend who said will do it if I sign for it. Should I let him do it?

I have never really had a boyfriend unless you count one time in seventh grade but anyway. Now we are sixteen and they broke up back in October because he cheated on her. She feels punished because she had to brake up with him because she felt like it was not right that he cheated on her. That was almost six months ago and she is still not over him. I understand that she was with him a lot but it has gotten a lot worse in the past month or so. She can't carry a normal conversation with out his name coming up. Today I stopped by her locker and she was just standing there crying. I just want to help but I'm not sure how. Can you please help me? Please????? Thank you:)      I know this is not in the right category but a lot of people with great advice are always in fashion and accessories.

20090309132609AAPtLoh	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I'm really confused with the whole tanning thing?	Going to a tanning bed is said to be very dangerous. How?   Tanning outdoors is said to be bad as well? How?      Which is better? And if neither one is better than the other, then someone must of gotten something wrong because there's no way to not be in the sun during summer?       I really want to get a tan, a dark one this summer, and I'm going on vacation, but I always burn, no matter what I do, and I don't mind it but I want to at least burn here before I go on vacation to prevent the pain. Should I just go to the tanning bed? Everyone says that even going once opens the door for skin cancer? But tanning in the tanning bed and outside, whats the difference? I get burnt anyway. Also, How does  tanning cause skin cancer? Please include links/sources and a detailed answer. Thank in advance!

20090309173133AAvcICt	Beauty & Style;Hair	Anyone have a son with longhair/ponytail?	I have a 14 year son with the long hair.  He has always had long hair since he was really young.  When he was 10 he cut off his hair and did not like it, so he decided to grow it out again.  When he was younger i used always take care of it for him and now he has to take care of his hair on his own.  When he is at school i make him wear his hair in a ponytail.  He is really into playing sports so it must be tied up out of his face during his game.  When he is playing sports it must be in a ponytail or in ill let him braid it like that boy in the basketball movie "Like Mike"  All his friends think that is cool and are growing their hair out.  When he is at home he can wear his hair anyway he wants usually he will wear it in a bun or down.  My 17 year old daughter told me i should let him wear his hair different ways.  My question is should i let him wear his hair at school in different ways beside a ponytail?  Here is a pic  http://s652.photobucket.com/albums/uu243...

The application took an overall 20-30 minutes, and I left the dye on my hair for about 25 minutes after that. When I rinsed out the dye, the color was perfect. Now, I'm noticing that it's getting lighter. I know hair color is supposed to fade, but I thought using professional quality would help prevent it. So basically, I would like to know if there's anything I can do to retain my hair color? Any shampoos&conditioners you advise? Thank you(:

20090309164821AAVPM0R	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why do good looking guys only like beautiful girls?	I've always had this question on my mind. Whenever I see a very attractive boy with his girlfriend or flirting with somebody, it's always an amazingly gorgeous girl. Pretty much all of the attractive guys always hang around beautiful girls. I just wonder why.      Personally, I believe everybody has something ugly and beautiful about them. I always look for the beautiful things, but guys only look for the ugly things to judge them. If they find something wrong with them, BOOM! They're out of the picture. I just don't get why they care about looks so much. You have a beautiful girlfriend, so what? What's that going to do for you? What's so special about dating a good looking girl? Now, I get that anybody would be lucky to be dating a wonderful, pretty girl, but why do people care so much?      A lot of my friends have a majority of three guys asking them out a week. If my friends like an attractive guy, the boy likes them back because of their looks. A few girls I know that have great personalities and like a couple of good looking boys, but the boys never talk to them and have even made fun of them. It just seems cruel to judge people on their looks.      This is a very strange, dumb, and weird question, I know, but why is it whenever there is an attractive guy, they only like an attractive girl?

It has a lot of little brown flecks (bark? lol) in it which actually gives it a rough texture which isn't too comfortable on my skin. I don't want to waste the soap, so I was thinking of melting it down, straining out the little rough bits, and remolding it back into a bar shape. Advice for doing this? I'm not too knowledgeable on soap making. What's the most effective and least messy way to strain out the bark?      Thanks!

20081020083205AAvM62B	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I'm almost 18, yet still scared to ask my mom to get my nose pierced, how to ask?	I'll be 18 in a month, and I really want my nose pierced. As soon as possible, would be awesome, but I'm willing to do it without consent.   The only problem is, I have NO CLUE of my mother, or father's, stance on this. Likely my mom will care less than my father, but gaining her approval will allow her to convince my mom, so that's all I care about right now.   It's not that easy for me to just randomly say, "hey, mom! I want my nose pierced...." That would just be really hard for me to do since I am so unsure of the reaction that may follow, negative or positive, I do not know.   Also my job prevents me from "showing" it, yet I don't work at all in December, so I wouldn't have to worry about it then, and wait until I can replace it with a retainer, or just cover it with a snip of a band-aid?   I think my mom's only reason she would say no is because of my current job, or other jobs (since I'm looking for a new one, that would hopefully be more chill.) Yet I have teacher's that have nose piercings, so I don't see the problem. Sigh.    What's the best way to ask her that I want this done, how can I segue into this topic? Give me your best! Thank you, and I'll expand details if needed.

20090309154829AA8plRp	Beauty & Style;Hair	Does semi-permanent hair dye completely fade out?	If I do dye my hair darker will the color completely come out, so that eventually my hair will look the exact same as it does now?       I used to dye my hair permanently all time.  I got tired of it and haven't dyed it for over a year.  My natural hair color is light brown (I used to be a blonde and it darkened, hence the dying!) but it has a darker shade towards the bottom (from the last time I dyed it brown) and about an inch of a faded blonde at the ends. I swore that I would never dye my hair again, but now I'm thinking about dying it a semi-permanent medium brown/red. I just don't want my natural hair color to look differently after it has "faded" out.       Thanks!

I'm taking prenatal vitamins and I'm using Pantene's beautiful lengths shampoo/conditioner. I can't stop straitening my hair because I used to have really curly hair but now it's just neither strait or curly. I'm thinking that if I get a perm I'd stop straitening my hair and my hair will have a chance to grow. What kind of perm should I get?    I want to avoid getting the old lady grandma look. I have thin hair that goes down to my right above my shoulders without touching them.    I'm worried about getting a perm that would cause more damage. But my hair is fine up until about a 4th of an inch at the bottom.       So there is Body-wave, multi-textured, pin curls, root, stack, spot, spiral, weave, gentle wavy, and partial spiral. Which would be good for me if I should get one at all?

20090309134959AAtJUDa	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should I get a perm....?	I HATE my hair. It's horrible. It's so straight and very thin and just yuck...but when I curl it is nice, for once I am content with my hair! I wish it could always be like that...it is too much to curl it everyday. So should I get a perm?       I don't really mind that it damages your hair...I'd rather my hair look good...! I've never dyed my hair and I think it's pretty healthy.       Do you think the hairdresser could do it the way I want? It wouldn't turn out really bad, would it? Experiences? I also feel a little strange...kinda like an old woman but I'm only 17. Maybe people would laugh at me...what do you say to people if one day you go curly! Euhhh "I've been straightening my hair for the past 17 years??" lol...      Thanks!

I've been using the same dye (Herbal Essences, "Black Stilettos") to achieve the same color, but my hair doesn't seem to take to the dye like it used to.

I just thought it would be easy enough to get it taken in by the seams at the side? I realized it might cost as much as the dress did again to get it altered but thought it could be done. Am I wrong?   Any help most gratefully appreciated!           http://www.ribbonsandpearls.co.uk/catalo...

20090309125526AAu2jzb	Beauty & Style;Hair	Will I ruin my hair by dying it 3 times?	I wanted to lighten my hair to a dark blonde/light brown from dark brown and so I used Loreal Pre-Lightener and then Loreal 10 min dye in dark blonde.  My hair has now gone a very strong gold colour.  I want to knock out the gold tones by dying it again (i can't live with orange hair) but am worried that if I dye it again it will kill my hair.  How long do i need to wait before dying it again?  Will it break the hair?  I normally only dye it every 4/5 months but i really don't want to end up bald!  Any advise would be appreciated.
