20090220170057AALUC7H	Pets;Cats	ARE THESE FISH OIL CAPSULES OK?	These are the fish oil capsules I got from my vet for my cat, but are they OK? And a good kind? Some people have now said that cod liver oil is only best for us humans, but these pills have that in them, so I am confused now. Others are also saying that Salmon oil is the best for cats, but I don't think salmon oil is in these.       I don't know anything about fish oil and pills and what not, so I am trying my best. I want to trust my vet, but I thought it was best to ask people on here, especially if they've used this kind.       The kind is: Skin Formula 3V caps. Anyone used these pills for their cat? Is it safe? Thanks, I know I've asked previous questions, but I am not a pro at fish oil so I need to ask. I care a lot about my pets and don't want to give them something that will harm them or is not good for them.       I needed it for my cats, skin and hair troubles. He has dry skin and his fur is rough. He also needed it for his kidneys and heart. Thanks.

But unfortunately lately; since my new neighbor moved in with another dog; they have got in several brutal fights! And Rambo has hurt that other dog pretty bad. I ended up paying some vet bills, and this guy is very arrogant and has his dog out all the time, restricting me and Rambo somewhat. So my hands are tied here. And I need some help. Any advice?

I bought 3 frozen rats from petco 2 days ago for my 3 ball pythons. well, i defrosted them in the fridge, and i went to go feed them today. One decided to start shedding, so he is not interested. the other is hiding up in a spot that I cant get him out of- hes gotta come down on his own. and the other seems to be in hibernation mode- i don't know if he will end up eating- his rat is warming up now.      so how long can these rats last in the fridge before they go bad? can i refreeze them?

I know they shed, but he has never shed this badly this before.  By extreme, I mean you can just pet him or gently pull his hair and clumps come out.  He does not have any bald spots, excess dander, itching, etc. or any other signs of skin problems.  He also has bright eyes, soft & shiny coat, very energetic, etc.  So I really don't think it's a health issue.  I haven't changed his diet.  I know husky's go through a "blowing their coat" phase 2 times a year.  Could this be what he is going through?  What do you do to help get rid of the excess hair?  I have been brushing him.  How long does this last?   Would it be normal not having this in the puppy stages, but when they are adults?  He just turned two and I did not notice this at all when he was a pup.

When I got my 11 week old shih tzu puppy, I went straight to the vet to get him checked up and to ask important matters such as getting him fixed.        I inquired about neutering, and the vet said that his testes were already "dropped" and that I don't have to wait too long to have him neutered. He was 8 weeks at  the time.  She didn't say NOW.  She didn't really say when to neuter him...         Is this normal for his testes to drop that early?

I bought a lovebird two weeks ago and he is nice and tame, kind of. He will come out of the cage willingly, but will not go back that easy. He also gets upset when I leave him alone. He squawks until I come back and he can fly back on my shoulder. If I or mostly anyone else puts their hand on my shoulder he will run to the other side. If the person keeps on trying he will bite. I think he is scared of hands. When I tried to clip his wings (because sure does fly good.) he lost his mind. He bit me, it didn’t hurt so bad that I had to stop, but it was more then a love bite. Really I do not think he was trying to hurt me I think he was trying to get back on my shoulder or to his cage. I can not pet him, because he runs away and sometime bites if he is in my room. (where he lives.) I guess he is more conformable there.  I love him, and I am scared he is unhappy and I do not know what to do. I think I have been treating him more like a dog then a bird. Please help me Louie!!

He is eating plastic, glass, his own fur, and basically anything else that fits in his mouth. He is in my room now with the door closed so he can't eat anything else but he is still looking for something to eat. He is never like this and I am really worried about him. This has been going on for about 3 hours. Oh and I switched his dog food about a week ago because there is no way for me to get his old dog food. That might have something to do with it but it probably doesn't. Please help!

Right now, we haven't had her fixed yet and shes about 6 months old. When we first got her when she was 6 months old she was so sweet! She would run up to us and give is head rubs. We always held her and gave her so much love. Gradually, as she became older she became more and more less affectionate and would run away from us when we tried to pick her up...if we did end up snagging her she would make this werid mmeauhhh and would sometimes hiss. She is kind of crazy too, if you stare her in her eyes she pounces at you and tries to bite you and claw you. Whenever strangers come over too, she always hisses at them! I have had my friends and relitives try to hold her but she hisses in thier face and its looks so ugly! She's not as nice as she used to be and I really don't like it! So do you have any ideas of why she has turned so evil and if you have any suggestions!??!

20090220173236AAj4aEY	Pets;Cats	Information on tortoiseshell cats?	We took in a little stray a few weeks ago, and upon taking her to the vet, we found she was pregnant. It was too late in the pregnancy to go ahead with a spay, so here we are with 4 newborn kittens. I breed and show dogs, so I'm pretty confident that I will be able to handle the kittens just fine. My question is actually about color. It appeared that we had 3 little black kittens (2 males, 1 female), and one little blue kitten (female) On closer inspection today it seems as though the little black female has orange markings in her fur, but only about 2 or 3. Would she be considered a tortoiseshell? From what I have read, only females will have this coloring so maybe she is? Thanks to anyone that fills me in with a little info. I know dogs inside and out, not so much about cats.

20070224050418AAOl1wx	Pets;Other - Pets	Has anyone ever heard of or encountered "equine heart murmur leading to stroke and death?	I had a two year old registered full lepard appaloosa that was born on my farm as healthy as they come. She ran and played with all the other horses, was extremely mischeivious, had absolutely no signs of any kind of ailment, and appeared absolutely healthy as could be.   Several days ago she was in the barn being a pain as usual when all of a sudden she collapsed never able to get back to her feet. We had two vets respond immediately and spent several fruitless hours doing everything possible but ended with euthanasia. She was able to move her head but that was it. I have had horses all my life and thought I'd seen everything however, I was absolutely stunned by this occurance!   I was just searching to find some information if anyone had ever encountered such a situation. I found heart murmurs are common among horses but could find nothing referring to equine strokes.   The vets suspect she suffered from a heart murmur as they clearly detected it while at the farm, leading to a stroke.

20061202063758AAzzeRW	Pets;Dogs	Why Does My Dog Do This?	Okay my mini dachshund is a pain once again, he doesnt bark at adults but he thinks he can bark at kids. I mean no just woof to say hello he gets so angry in his bark that the kids get scared to look at him. I dont know why he is this way he has been around kids ever since he was a pup! and they didnt hurt him or anything because I got my little guy from my mother in law and was there the whole time to watch him grow up. We did recently bring him to kids day at the fair, he did seem nerves but still let the kids pat him and cuddle him without barking or getting too scared. did I damage my dog loving kids by doing this, or is it just a thing he is going through? I cant have him be upset towards kids because he goes to our buisness so he is not left at home alone and kids come in so plz HELP!!!!

20070128084800AA1Fga6	Pets;Birds	Lice on chickens?	I butchered a chicken yesterday, and while plucking, I found it infested with lice.  The chicken looked very healthy, was missing no feathers...and all around looked good.  So it came as quite a shock.  After more research, I see that they have probably had them awhile.  The chickens have lost weight and stopped laying, but I thought that was due to the severe cold that we have had around here.  So my question is, what is the best way to get rid of the lice?  I need something that doesn't have a weaning off time for egg consumption but that is very effective.  I also need to know if there are any diseases associated with fowl lice.  I was going to apply for NPIP certification in 3-4 months, even though these birds will be gone and I will have 100 new birds (babies from other stocks) have these lice brought diseases on my property that will keep me from participating in the poultry improvement program?  Also, is it quite common to have bird lice?  Or is it all my fault!?

20061209031901AAZI7qn	Pets;Dogs	Hi, I have a shar pei that willnot eat unless we hand feed her.. Its been weeks n we've tried everything..Help	And yes we have have changed bowls, several times now, changed foods, put the bowl up higher..etc She is given a great diet and none of it consists of canned dog food as she has never liked it and we really don't like to feed her anything we wouldn't eat.  She isn't eating her biscuits either. However will tell when she's hungry and is interested when you're eating but even if you give her the same thing in a bowl or on a plate she will not even consider it.  Sometimes she's even a little relucant to eat when hand feeding her.  She's lost weight and its bothering me quiet a lot! Especially because she usually will eat all day if you let her, but usually has 2 meals a day. I can understand her cutting back to 1 because of summer but this behaviour is odd. Its costing us a fortune too. Vet has been no help either.

20070513211218AAoNckv	Pets;Dogs	Puppy Nipping/biting 24/7 and excitement urination! Solutions?	We currently have a dog, he's an outside dog and a beagle/terrier mix. He has had excitement and sometimes submissive urination problems since day one.The vet has ruled out any health problems and pretty much just said he would grow out of it. Anything I can do to help him? It's not a big deal, but its embarrassing to take him to the park and have him pee on people that pet him!   Also, he is a nipper. The easiest way to describe it, is to imagine him opening his mouth and putting it over your hand. It doesnt hurt most of the time, but still...I've never had a dog do this,so I really dont know how to fix this! I wouldnt call it biting though... Is this a behavioral thing? Can obidence classes fix this? Sometimes he is actually getting some skin. I want to keep him, but in order to, I HAVE to get this under control. is there hope?While I'm on the subject of him, when you try and play fetch he acts INSANE,growling at the air, snarling,then he's fine when were done!WHY?He's not aggressive!

20070618174549AAzE7Di	Pets;Other - Pets	Couple of funny stories..wut'dya think?	earlier this year,my mom's former landlord told us a story about 1of her dogs'(she has2).1day she was gunna let him out on the porch,but b4 she did,she noticed a cat out on the railing.so she snuck the dog out there,& wen he started barking,he scared the poor cat so bad that wen it tried 2jump down& run away,it ended up jumping headfirst in2 a snowbank.the only thing visible was its butt & tail up in the air.LOL.(how nice, a catbutt-shaped snowbank.)      on a tv show called 'totally outrageous behavior' last yr., me&mom saw this farm guy who was in the cowpen w/ 1of the cows. i think the guy was on his way out(he was by fence), wen the cow suddenly jumped on his back &started trying 2hump him.luckily, the guy managed 2escape after a few sec.s   it looked like a really rough ride, i guess cuz the cow waz full grown.      btw, if u want 2c the show, or the other show called 'world's most amazing videos', then u'll find it on the spike channel.dont know the #, just the name of the station.

20070615191211AAiMevv	Pets;Dogs	Dog terrified of gnats?	My short haired terrier seems to have a problem with gnats. At least that is what I am guessing. At a certain point in the warm weather, it started a few weeks ago, she acts like she has something crawling on her when we go for a walk. Hotter weather seems to make it worse. I can't see any bugs on her, no fleas, etc. That's why I am guessing gnats. She gets quite agitated and can't wait to get back inside. Later in the summer she will return to her usual wanting to go for long walks and hunt chipmunks. Any one else with a similar problem? She does go out to relieve herself, no problems there. Just doesn't want to stay out any longer than she has to now. We live in the midwest. Thanks for any input!

20070901170640AA738lX	Pets;Other - Pets	Calling all horse people!!  I need some help.?	About a week ago, my best friend and her husband gave us (my family) a 6 month old haflinger colt.  He has a problem with his hind leg, so they couldn't sell him (they breed them to sell) and gave him to us.  His back knee joint stays swollen all the time, sometimes not very much, other times alot.  They had him checked by a vet right before we took him, and the vet said there was nothing wrong that he could find, and it would probably always be like that.  My question is, is there anything we can do to help the swelling?  It's never hot to the touch, or anything like that, and he has no obvious injuries to his leg or hoof, and I look every day to make sure theres nothing I've missed.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  Thanks

He says it's fine because the dog is getting used to it, and 'she's fine with it', according to him. When I suggested that he gets another dog to keep her company during the day while he's at work, he said that's would be too many dogs!

20090203082536AAt8a0t	Pets;Horses	Hunter braids :(  [20characters]?	OK I can't do hunter braids to save my life. But I really want to improve. Last show I braided for, I felt my horse's mane was too short. This isi due to the fact that in practicing braiding for the show, I felt it was a little long, so pulled a ton of it untill it was way too short. SO I let it grow out over the winter and now  it is way too long and way too thick. How long should it be for ideal hunter braids? Also, my horse has a very very thick mane, so if I pull it enough to get the right thickness, it's too short. And if I pull it to the right length its too thick. Please help :(

20090203082612AApozfe	Pets;Dogs	WWYD rottie in pain and cant walk...PLEASE ACTUALLY READ!?	Ok I know nothing abt back/hip problems in rotties and I am starting here.    My dad started a fund to help ppl that cannot afford surgeries etc for their pets he will pay/help pay.  Well I found a lady on craigslist that has a 5-6 year old rottie that is having a hard time walking...she is having to move him and she said he is in pain.  He has been outside for 5 years...inside 2 weeks....and never been on HW meds...     I called the vet and they are going to see her tomorrow...i asked to have him evaluated and tested for HWs and given a rabies vaccine...he has never been to her vet...    I am torn though...if the dog is hw pos (very likely in NC) do we treat that and then try to do surgery (if operable) for the dog or do I just tell her I am sorry I cannot help you.    I feel bad for the dog and want to do what I can but then again if he was outside in a pen honestly how much of a family member is the dog and is it wise to spend (pretty much all of what my dad saved so far) on this one dog.  I feel real bad for her...she is stuck...she was looking on craigslist for a wheel chair...    ****I know dad and he will probably do it but I wonder how risky is the surgery for hips and how much financially will it cost this lady for ongoing care...which is another thing if she could not afford HW prevention and rabies vaccine.  What is the recovery from HW and hip surgery like? ******    Thanks

20090203084023AA1hemX	Pets;Horses	Winter blanket for an Arabian?	Hello everyone, I have a six-year-old Arabian gelding that I adopted from the horse rescue. We have quite the success story, but long story short: he came to me skinny and untrained and now he's pleasantly plump and very well trained. I originally thought that he would be fine without a winter blanket because his coat was like an otter's: dense but not necessarily real "poofy". But I discovered that his coat is not very repellent of water, so snow melts on his back and freezes, making him shiver. I blanket both of my boys when it gets below fifteen degrees because the Arab is fine with cold; it's just the snow that gets him. I have been putting the only blanket I have that isn't being worn: a size 78" waterproof 300 gram polyfill blanket. It fits him alright... he's a size 72" so it is too long for him and it is too loose around the shoulders, but it doesn't cause him any problems. However, being that he is staying with us for life now (we just legally adopted him), I would like to get him his own blanket. I am looking for a waterproof heavy weight (200-300 gram polyfill) blanket under $100 made for narrow horses with a considerable drop length (to cover his plumpness).   So, my question is... Does anyone know of a reasonably priced blanket that would be suitable for a Arab?      Sorry for the length... I like to be thorough...   Thanks in advance! :]
