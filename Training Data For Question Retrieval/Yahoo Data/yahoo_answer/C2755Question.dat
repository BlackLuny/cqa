20070504172026AAcZNrc	Pets;Other - Pets	Für Tiere bremsen?	Es hei?t ja, wer für Tiere bremst, und dadurch einen Verkehrsunfall verursacht, ist schuld!   Ist hier nicht eine Gesetzes?nderung unbedingt notwendig???   Ich mag Tiere sehr gern und würde sowieso für Tiere bremsen, aber davon mal abgesehen, bremst doch jeder halbwegs normale Autofahrer schon aus reflex wenn pl?tzlich irgendwas auf die Fahrbahn rennt oder rollt oder wie auch immer, oder?   Ich habe vor kurzem eine Katze überfahren. Es war Nacht, also dunkel, und pl?tzlich lief da was auf die Fahrbahn! Ich habe nicht drüber nachgedacht ob ich jetzt bremsen soll oder nicht, sondern aus reflex Vollbremsung, hat der Katze aber leider nichts mehr genützt!   Zum Glück war niemand hinter mir, sonst h?tte es sicher gerumst, und ich w?re schuld gewesen.   Ist dieses Gesetz nicht bescheuert, weil wie gesagt bremst man doch normalerweise aus reflex, und es wird ja auch von einem Autofahrer erwartet das er schnelle reflexe hat, sonst müsste man ja Alkohol am Steuer nicht verbieten und jeder überf?hrt alles

20070503053523AAUUnTL	Pets;Birds	Why did my baby bird die?	Found baby starling bird in the parking lot. Thought he was about to die b/c he wasn't moving much and was breathing heavily.  put him in a box and was planning on taking him to a rehab center.  He then seemed to perk up and hop around normal so I figured he was okay just exhausted.I put him back outside but by the window so I could keep an eye on him.I wanted him to get back with his parents he was at the fledging stage.  A cat ran by and I just couldn't leave him out there anymore to get eaten by a cat.I took him home and contacted a rehaber for info.  I purchased baby bird formula and meal worms.  We fed him the formula and drops of water to hydrate him for the first night and in the morning he was doing PERFECTLY.  So yesterday we went on to meal worms, crushing their heads first so they didn't bite.  He took them down with no problem and was starting to show signs that he would soon learn to fly.This morning went in to feed him and he was dead.  I'm so upset how could this happen?

20070330134534AAtl0yG	Pets;Dogs	My dogs play to rough?	I have 2 dogs (male - 1.5 years old pointer mix, female 1 year old we think a mastiff/beagle mix) and they play VERY rough with each other.  I kow its play but its disturbing to our neighbors and, honestly, the rough housing inside is driving my husband and I crazy!  We are consistant in telling them to quit, but as soon as we turn around, they're back at it.  It usually stems from the female "stalking" the male and then pouncing.  Then it just gets loud with growls and they wrestle, get dirty and just cause a commotion.     I adopted the male at 8 weeks and he is much more compliant to us.  The female we adopted at 3 months old.  I have no idea how she was treated before we got her.  She's very energetic.  Coudl it be her breed?  The way she was treated as a small pup?  Is this normal?   How do we get it to stop?  I love them both dearly and we pay alot of attention to them, so its not like they're bored and need attention.      Thanks!

20090131104946AAmz0zT	Pets;Horses	Unsound horse but clean bill of health from vet?	Ok theres a horse at our stable I got permission to work with and I was talking with the triner yesterday and this is all thats going on.   OK the horse is an andalusian she is 6 years old. She had lots of problems when she was born i dont know what all, though. Her front left foot is a club foot and the problem is with her right hind foot. She seems really stiff in it and at times her whole hindend will just drop under her and drop behind a few steps. The vet has done X-rays as far up her leg as he can, from her hoof to her hock. To get her hips done she would have to be sent off island so the owner dosent wanna do that.The x-rays came back clean and he gave the ok to work her as hard as we want. So the trainer suspects she may just be lacking muscle in her hindend since along her spine by her tail its all dipped in.I will be working her 3 times a week mostly at a trot with side reins to help her gain muscle. So any other ideas what could be wrong with her?

They haven't come in the male yet.. but I how likely is the chance of them eating one another? Would I have to buy 2 separate tanks?
20090131083807AAZEjgN	Pets;Reptiles	Will my new terrapin still be alive by tomorrow?!?!?	I upgraded my tank yesterday from a 50gallon to 190gallon so I could get a new friend for my Yellow Bellied Slider. The new terrapin (Larry) was just put in the tank about 4hrs ago. My old terrapin (Oscar) had been in for the night. They keep doing that hand vibrating thing to each other, then Oscar tries to have sex with Larry, but when Larry does the vibrating thing he just does it for no reason.       Oscar has been alone all his life, about 5-6yrs. Larry is 1yr old, same size as Oscar and same species. They are both male. Neither are acting particulary aggressive but Oscar will NOT stop following the new one around. Will they both be okay or will I wake up with some injured terrapins tomorrow?

20090131131147AAMaSeL	Pets;Dogs	Puppy wont eat good food?	I've got an Australian Shepherd puppy, he's almost 4 months old and I want him to eat the very best food so he will grow properly. He will not eat the good for him food. I've tried mixing wet food of the same brand with it, cooking him homemade gravy, adding warm milk, dressing it up anyway I can think of and he still would rather go outside and eat what my son's dog is eating. We feed our son's dog ol'roy because that's what he'll eat. Yes I know you all have an opinion of ol' roy, but It's what he will eat and that's that so keep it to yourself unless you're actually going to try to help here.      I want to know, what can I do to get him to eat the better quality food?

20090131122634AAPA5nB	Pets;Rodents	Freddy, my very bored hamster.?	I have a hamster named Freddy. He has a HUGE cage but almost nothing in it. He has some chew toys but prefers the bars. I took out his wheel because he didn't use it.      I put him in his ball every once and a while. One time he slammed into the wall and got out. We found him under a shelf, eating dusty dark chocolate.   Another time, he got out of his cage (How? That's still a mystery). We set up a trap with books and a box (BTW: That doesn't work but if you are looking for a lost hamster... hamsters have bad eyesight so they stay near walls).  Again, we found him but i came to the conclusion that he was bored cuz we didn't let him out enough.      With about 20 dollars, how could i make my hamster happier if he's not allowed out of some sort of "container"?   Help me!

20090131115851AAapVU6	Pets;Cats	What kind of Cat do I have?	Okay, so I don't have a picture for you to look at to help you determine what kind of Cat I may have, but I will explain what the Cat looks like, and also tell you a little about his personality.      The Cat is either orange or brown and white.   The reason I am having a hard time determining whether his color is brown or orange is that it is hard to tell.        Anyway, I prefer to say his color is orange and white.      He is not fat, but a little tall and muscular, and relatively weighty. His eyes are also orange, or should I say light brown? I have no darn idea.       About his personality:       He likes to come by to rub himself against me but hates when I touch him.   When I try to touch him, he would bite me and get really upset.       He is very rambunctious and playful.       What kind of Cat is this?        I apologize for not posting a picture for you to see, but if you have a picture of a Cat that you might think its one like him, please post it.       Thanks.   Dad

20090131131125AATLIHe	Pets;Cats	My cat covers hairballs with random things?	My longhair cat has hairballs occasionally, which is to be expected.  But when he does, he goes and finds stuff to hide it.  The first time he moved a dish rag half way over top of it.  I just figured somehow the dish rag was kicked over there, no big deal.  This time he moved  a dog toy, a shoe, a sock, a piece of paper and a rag and placed them all on top of the hairball.      I don't think any people I live with would go out of their way to move socks, rags, shoes, etc to cover a hairball.      I've never heard of a cat doing this but it doesn't make sense for it to be someone else.  Why would he do this?  Do your cats do strange things like this?

When I went to Cancun , Mexico I heard meow-ing in the bushes the first day I was there , (i was staying for 2 weeks ) i looked there and I saw kittens , i decided to leave them alone , there mom had to be somewhere around.      But I heard the same meow-ing in the bushes for 4 straight days , so i finally said "let me just check them out to see if there ok " so i picked them up and they were so skinny ! I could see there ribs !       So i was so sad because well , i'm a sucker for animals , and they were so small and hungry , one was a boy and the other was a girl , then i remembered that I had a blanket in my bag (i was heading for the beach ) so i put the blanket in the bushes and put the kittens on it , where they couldn't be seen. And I went out and bought some fish, chicken , corn beef , and water . They looked to be at least 2 months old . And when I gave it to them , uh , they ate and drank so fast ! They ate everything ! when they were done there stomachs looked like tennis balls .       After that they trusted me , they let me touch them , and they purred when I did it too . Then they took a nap . 2 hours later i went to check on them , they were up and hungry again , so i bought them what they ate last time , except while i was at the store I bought them some toys too . After they ate I played with them . I did this every 2 hours , except for at nights .       I have been doing this for the past 2 weeks and I have to leave Cancun in 2 days ! I don't want to leave them , i've become so attached to them ! And when I'm gone , who will feed them ? Play with them ? And pet them ?  (there not so skinny anymore by the way) I don't know what to do !      And then they will notice that i'm gone , and they will never trust humans again because of what i've done ! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME !!!!

When I am out on a walk with her she will be aggressive to some people and dogs, by growling and pulling on the lead. Afterwards she will run away and whimper. She doesn't do it with everyone though some people and dogs she will just walk past. Also when she isn't on the lead she will be playful with other dogs and people. What is wrong and how can I help her?

When he looks up at me while I'm stand in front of him...his ears flap open-straight up. I call them the "radar ears" - lol.  It doesn't look right for some reason. I thought that even if they are looking up the ear flaps still stay down. This is my first dog and there are still things that I am unsure of.

20090131123544AAxM3l9	Pets;Dogs	How can I stop my dog from farting so much?	I feed him healthy dry dog food, I've tried so far (by brand)   The Goodlife Recipe   Blue   and about two or three others I can't recall the names of. I've tried using puppy dog food (he's about 8 months old), normal dog food, and senior dog food (probably a bad idea because of the fiber). Would a way to reduce his relentless farting be to find the food with the least amount of fiber in it? Basically, does anyone know or have any tips about how to reduce his farting?

Around noon I noticed him acting very unusual, wandering around in circles and returning to his shelter after.  He seems very confused, though he's eaten when presented food.  He's going behind my stove, and trying to get in various places he had previously no interest in.      I have no access to a veterinarian over the weekend.  Does this sound like hypoglycemia?

20090131114220AAQoGjs	Pets;Dogs	What do you think of this poem?	SOME DOGS      I popped out so small and wet,   My mummy licked me all over ill never forget.      I loved her so and all my littler mates,   We grew together and started eating off plates.      We wagged our tails when we saw our human leader,   then off in a crate I left my Breeder.      Flying high in the sky in a jumbo jet, the sound hurt my ears,   And when the cage opened there was some one who cares.      I learnt lots like how to sit and stay,   it and was fun to be hugged and play.      My new mummy was really cool.   and once I was so proud when she took me to school.      All of the kids loved patting me,   I was so happy fulled with Glee.      One morning I awoke to a quick piddle out side and a pat,   then off in a crate on my favorite Matt.      In the truck we drove for a long time,   I knew that everything had changed it was no longer fine.      Being dropped off in a new home,   I sat in the wash house all alone.      Then I went outside held by the scruff of my neck,   and thrown in a cage I thought what the heck.      Another dog that shared my run,   Bullied me and hurt me it wasn't much fun.      I couldn't get away he was there in my cage,   I waited everyday for my food at that stage.      I hadn't had affection I hated each day.   I wondered what I did wrong to be sent away.      Then my new owner put me in a cardboard box,   I sat in there with dirty old socks.      The lid was shut tight I couldn't get out,   and when I tried he would shout.      I felt sad and scared what was wrong with me,   When I got out of the box all I could see.      Were hundreds of other dogs barking Runs,   I was put in one under the hot baking sun.      Some other dogs were taken to new places,   others were dragged off with shock on their faces.      I tried to sleep feeling totally alone,   When an old lady walked passed holding her cell phone.      She stopped and put her hand through my cage then rubbed my Fur.   My body trembled as I wanted to be hugged by her .      In a feeling of love and warmth that was the start.   she demanded the door open and held me close to her heart.      She carried me gently off to her car,   I looked deep into her brown eyes and knew we would go far.      For such along time I didnt know what was wrong with me.   I finally worked out it wasnt my fault it was my other owners you see.   :0)

I've searched the web for informations and what i've found is:      1. rabbits can't get a cold. Colds are caused by virus. She definitly has a bacterial infection.      2. It can be Abscesses or rabbit syphillies. I don't know what it is.         3. I don't think she has snuffels cause she doesn't have runny nose. Her nose is crusty and black. It seems like her nose is gonna fall      I'm very much tensed. I've read all the articles on the internet. Whatever it is , it says that eventually she's gonna die if there is no treatment.Some say to inject antibiotic (penicilin g procain). I'm not an expert but a caring mother of them. I love her very much. please help me.         What is her disease? What can I do for her? (no vet!!)      Here is 1 of her recent pic.

20090131141616AAz9njV	Pets;Dogs	I've been taking care of this dog, but now I have a problem.?	First off, my neighbors have this female dog. They don't feed her properly and she has pups that she's feeding them, of course. They make all of them stay out in the cold, in some kind of barrel that is supposed to be like a dog house, but anyways, it's really just a piece of garbage that doesn't do much of anything as far as protection from the cold. So, this female comes to my house all the time and she looks so sick and malnourished I can't help but feed her. She's a sweet dog and I would love if she had a good home only problem she's a pitt bull and where I live the shelter automatically puts pitts down because they can't risk one being aggressive( I would have called them ages ago to come get her if it wasn't for that). So, basically I've been taking care of her under her real owners' nose. Problem is she brought her pups to my house today and I don't know what to do. They look about 3-4 weeks old, but I don't want to touch them, because she's very protective over them. I figured the only thing I could do was talk to my neighbors, BUT...I don't want to seem like I've been offering her a safehaven at my house...What should I do?

20090131133158AAcmHAs	Pets;Dogs	Regarding Basset Hounds and their eye drainage/water...?	My brother and sister-in-law recently got a Basset Hound whom was used as a Stud Dog; and they have to clean his eyes a *ton*.   Now, Basset Hounds are one of the few breeds I don't know that much about; so I can't give her any advice.   She's searched online for weeks, and hasn't found anything about it.   The only thing I know about Bassets, is that they have droopy eyes and it's common for them to drain some [I don't know how much].      They're going to take him to the vet if it persists, but they want to know what might cause this, and if it's common in the breed.      Any information you can give me would be excessively awesome and we'd be so thankful!!!   Cheers.

20090131132707AAL5zf9	Pets;Dogs	What classifies a dog as a Terrier? ?	If you determine type by the job the breed was bred to do, then, the Miniature Schnauzer is a terrier, along with the Mini Pinschers, the Boston Terrier and Dachshunds. I going by the AKC Standards.       Are Terriers all from the British Islands? Then then the Mini Schnauzer is not a Terrier.       Why is the Boston Terrier in the Non Sporting Group? They have Terrier in there names. But they too are not from the British Islands.       Hey (ROTTEN ROTTS)For the record My Schnauzer goes to ground, and is a great ratter. I have never trained him to so. I just let him be a dog.

20090131134526AAIUO5V	Pets;Cats	Cat appears to be happy and agile but throws up lately.?	My female cat is 7 to 9 months old (was a stray 3 months ago), she has had her vaccines and has been recently to the vet. Now, since 3 days she has been vomiting a lot of times.   Her behavior is normal, also her temperature, no hair loss and no mood change. Her eating has been more frequent (although its the amount my vet told me to give her per day) but now i am not sure (cause i suspect she eats too much-dry food that is). Her vomit is a lot, when she vomits its half digested food and she vomits it three times..that is why i think she eats too much at once or too greedily. Its Weekend now and i can only take her to the vet on monday...what can i do other Than limit her food? She does not hack hairballs but she does nibble at anything on the floor (carpets, whatever might be there---i really try,so that nothing is there). Thank you in advance.

20090131142350AA9dVGk	Pets;Dogs	Qualifications and credentials for dog training?	While I realize that some people here have trained dogs for so many years that they likely wouldn't need outside training, let's just assume for the sake of this question that you do...      Of course, training dogs does not require any type of formal education at all.  Any individual can start a business and advertise and market themselves as a dog trainer.  The question is... Are they really capable?      What kind of evidence do you need in order to know that trainer is qualified and has the proper background and abiltiy to actually train in the first place?  Do you actually need evidence, or are you willing to go for it and hope for the best without knowing for sure?      Do they need to have a titled dog in the area of training?  Students that trained with them that have titled dogs?  Does their breed make a difference?        I will give my opinions in a bit after I have had some input here first :c)

20090131141101AASM2iA	Pets;Cats	How to respond to people who make comments about my husband and I getting a cat when my husband is allergic?	My husband and I had a cat for 12 years. He had minor allergy issues that we didn't realize were the cat. After that cat died, he noticed his allergies got better. He went to a doctor who tested him and said he was allergic to cats, as well as dust and mould and certain plants. We decided that we wanted to have another cat though, so we got one, and it is my job to keep the house very clean to reduce any allergies he might have. He is mostly okay but sometimes has very bad allergy attacks which our doctor says are caused by the accumulation of allergens in the environment and not necessarily ONLY just the cat. He also washes his hands after touching our cat and tries not to let him sleep on his lap.       The problem is that my husbands family, my family and all our friends always make comments in the form of "joking" about how selfish I am to have agreed to get another cat when my poor husband is allergic. They never make the comments to him, so he can never respond. They only make it to me. Some of them border on mean. I had one "friend" say "How can you say you care about your husband when you went and got another cat?" I tell them, it was a joint decision and that we are dealing with his allergies, but people will sometimes just roll their eyes. It's worse when they see him having a bad allergy attack, but he had these even when we were between cats. He's allergic to LOTS of things, not just cats.       We're going to a dinner party tonight, and he's having allergy issues because we ripped out the carpet in our bedroom this morning. But everyone will just "blame the cat" and blame me.

I was looking into getting  http://www.mariculturetechnology.com/Liv...  the 1st one thats on the page, I would get two of them. I won't be getting one anytime soon I'm just doing my research. I found one website that said they needed a 30 gallon tank, and then on another website it said a minimum of 50 gallons. I dont know which website to go by. If there is anything else you can tell me that would be great.

20090131134607AA34e9q	Pets;Horses	ARGH help me please ?	ok heres the thing.      Three years ago my mum and i owned this really lovely horse. He was our absolute dream, perfect for us and we loved him so much. Unfortunately we had to sell him because of family issues, and we were heartbroken.     I got an email today from his owners. They need to sell him because they want to buy a different horse. They have told us first in case we want to take him back.      Obviously, we REALLY want to. It would be a dream come true to have him back, we thought we'd never see him again.      The problem is, we have five horses now. This is pretty costly, and not only would it be a struggle to afford another horse, they all need care and attention and we have a 3 year old filly in training and a 6 month old foal, so these need lots of our time. The only way i can think of to get him back is to sell one of the others. The woman actually asked if she could do a swap with one of our horses that she really likes. But I love her too! And all the others!      I can't imagine having to let one go, the heartbreak I went through with Beau was far too much to deal with again.      I don't know what to do =[

20090131133424AAhBu5X	Pets;Dogs	What would you do in this situation?	SO I was just at the park about 30 mins ago, and I decided to tie my dogs to a tree for some shade, and then sit back a little ways and take some quick pictures of them...  My little sister was playing on the playground (she's 8) so while she was playing I had my camera and took some pics of them.  I sat on the ground about 2 feet away and snapped some pics and then watched my lil sis play on the playground.        Well, when we decided to get up and leave my sis came over to me and said, "You see that girl over there? She asked her boyfriend 'Why is that F'ing girl sitting on the ground taking pictures of her F'ing dogs? What a loser!' "  Well this hurt my feelings, and now I feel like I don't want to do anything with my dogs in public again.  I mean I was just taking a few pics of my dogs and I have to be criticized about it?        Does it make me a loser because I like to have pictures of my dogs?   :(

20090225091055AAeN4US	Pets;Horses	Tips for mud-proofing a lower-leg injury?	My little boy (lol my Arabian) somehow lacerated his coronet band. It's not really serious, just some skin torn from the hoof. I am totally clueless as to how he did this; all I know is that it is a pain in the butt to keep clean in the mud. When i first saw it, the temperature was so cold that it would only cause the wound to freeze if I soaked it, causing more harm than good. Two days after he cut it the temperature got warmer so i soaked it in warm water to loosen the scabs and mud, soaked it in povidone-iodide solution to kill bacteria, and wrapped it all up in vetwrap. It stayed on... for all of maybe three hours. The mud saturated the wrap, causing it to stretch, tear, and ride up onto his fetlock. Because of the location, I no longer can wrap just the coronet and I also cannot do a poultice of sorts because he just walks right through it because of the mud. I cannot keep soaking his foot every time he gets dirty but I really don't have a choice as of now to help it heal well. So does anyone have any tips to help me keep him clean and help the injury heal? I am currently retrying the wrapping but nothing I have tried has worked. Thank you!

She had liver failue, probably due to ragwort poisoning (not from college, our fields are well maintained). We have been doing our best for her for the past few weeks but it had got to a point where she was obviously not going to improve.   I was wondering if anyone has had experience with this, where a horse has actually survived? This is the second horse I know who has had to be put down because of liver failure, so im just curious is anyone knows of a horse who has pulled through?

20090225091104AA2DbcU	Pets;Cats	What treatment did you go with on your hyper thyroid cat?	I've read about all the treatment options- so I don't want any "factual" data- just your PERSONAL experiences. What treatment did you go with? Were you happy with it? Would you do the same thing if you had to do it again?   Some more info- my cat is 9 (almost 10). So if you have a cat that had it the same age, even better (I'm just thinking in terms of years giving pills vs. other options and of course $$ is always a factor- not the most important-but still). Also- besides weight loss, my cat is fine. Most have caught it early. All other organs appear strong in bloodwork results.      Thanks!

20090131135531AAISD7o	Pets;Fish	Where did my snails go?	Hi, in September I bought a small Betta (young, very small male from an Aquarium store)-- and in Mid-December we finally got his 5 gallon tank set up. Previously, he was in a 1.5 gallon tank that just wasn't working out (too small, etc.)      However, before moving him into his new home, we spent several weeks establishing it. It's well-planted with Banana plants, a Java Fern, some anacharis, and some moneywort. In addition to this, we had a healty population of small snails. There was a pair of trumpet snails, and a bunch of unknown apple snails (who, we observed, were algae eaters and never did damage to the plants in the month or so the tank was without-a-fish.)      Anyway, anyway. We added the betta and he was curious about the snails, nipping at them occasionally, but I didn't think anything would come of it. However, here we are in January-- and I don't know where my snails have gone! There was around 30 of them, three or four of our original "mystery" snails were getting to be about the size of my pinky nail--- but uhh. Now? Not so much. Maybe ten mystery snails tops, all very very small. I realize that my trumpet snails are nocturnal, and maybe there are some of those hiding within the gravel, but-- yeah?      Water conditions are pretty perfect, lots of algae growth (um... another clue the snails have disappeared? they have plenty of *food*)-- I was just wondering what people think may've happened to them!      My original guess was that the fish had ate them... but.. everything I had read mostly suggested that Bettas might be curious about the snails, tops.

20090131132536AArlXM8	Pets;Fish	Is my fish paralyzed?	I have a fish in my 20 gallon freshwater aquarium, and I think it's a tetra. When I turned the light on this morning to feed my fish, I saw that it was sucked up against the filter. Our filter looks like this:       http://www.f3images.com/IMD/250/HG10600/...       Usually a fish is sucked up against the filter when it's dead, so I thought that it was dead. However, I looked closer and saw its mouth and eyes moving. So, I thought its fin was caught in the filter or something like that. But when I used a net to pull it away from the filter, it just got sucked against it again. It can't eat and I'm afraid that it'll starve to death. What happened to it and what should I do?

For vet appointments, I usually take all of them at once.(WHOA!) But it works. What upsets me is I would like to take them one or two at a time to the pet store - or walk one or two at a time but the one that doesn't get to go raises hell, barks, scratches at the door if she is left behind.  So I have been taking her (she's my only girl) along with one of the others. One time, I took her to the pet store 3 times, so I could take each one of the others.  I can only handle two at a time on outings.  Any advice on what to do with the one that freaks?  Can't put her in a cage, she'll hurt herself.

She also appears to have something wrong with her eye. She is squinting and it looks like it is bothering her.

I am not a vet and will get her to see one as soon as possible but the only problem is is that its Saturday and the local vet is closed. My question is do you think that its an emergency, should I take her to the hospital that's an hour away or should I just wait until the local vet opens on monday and take her in?

We are raising our own flock for eggs, but interested in the broilers too, but even with clean environment and washing hands after handling and thorough cooking I was concerned about food born illnesses.
20090225093851AA5a0RL	Pets;Dogs	Someone left this 2-3 mo old toy poodle in our driveway.. what should we do? (pic)?	this morning my mom saw someone drop off some animal in our driveway.  my 3 dogs ran off to find out what it was, it was a very very small toy poodle pup crying hiding under our picnic table. we had her for a few hours, she is beautfiul, red poodle, she was wearing a reddish white collar with bells on it, she is a little shy but gets along really well with my littlest dog dee dee. this may sound crazy but we are thinking about keeping her.. we are amazed that someone would just leave her, she is gorgeous and looks like a purebred good 900$ dollar poodle.       what should we do?
