DWwv3v9Raa	When I did smoke, it didn't really bother me after they made it a law, it probably was one of the main reasons why I gave it up. It turned out better for my health. It doesn't really bother me to smell the smoke of another person but, I understand how the non-smokers feel now because it actually does stink. It smells completely different to a non-smoker.<br>  <br>  I still get the occassional urge to smoke, especially when I go to Las Vegas and sit in the casino for hours ;-)...most casinos are not smoke free there.|`|AA10723657	i think that there should be some where to accommodate both smokers and non smokers|`|z0kSza6Eaa	I think it should be up to the owner.  If they want to cater to smokers and risk alienating non-smokers, it should be their choice.  It should be just like any other reason you pick a place to go to - atmosphere, cuisine, music, smoking vs non.  Non-smokers should not feel entitled to tell a business owner how to run their business.  They can vote with their feet and their money.  <br>  <br>  Smokers can also be more laid-back.  They don't spend as much time trying to regulate the behavior of others as non-smokers do.|`|7qOQL85saa	I smoke and I think its good (the ban, lol). The ban has already taken place in my country btw, I just think that even if there's a ban there could be like a corner for smokers or a nice booth with good air-conditioning.<br>  <br>  Usually smokers have to go outside or smoke in CRAPPY booths with no AC :S|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	It's nice.

IDcIww7Baa	People created evil. Perhaps someday we will evolve enough to take responsibility for it and obliterate it. One can hope.|`|23YPEAqBaa	I take my present-day-PC potential Evil as not a "price to pay," but rather a benefit of the gift of Freeing Willy.  My mother-in-law already looks like Yoda (!?Yoda?!) and I don't wish harm to others, not even my ex-husband.  But I'll still tell him off before he hangs up on me. lol|`|oL6FUbshaa	Yes, the potential to do Evil is a severe price to pay. But God was willing to pay it, because His bride is worth it.<br>  <br>  "For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross."|`|AA12084096	Would you prefer to be preprogrammed for obedience.  I think, by definition, would make humans robots.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Jehovah is the biggest monster I ever read about.  Endowed, ha ha ha.  I do not scapegoat or sugarcoat.

The idea is also completely unnecessary for anything accept trying to support certain forms of easily falsifiable religious dogma.<br>  <br>  The so called problem of evil fails for other reasons, but these start with the fact that no deity has ever been demonstrated to exist.|`|YUAegpPoaa	How could it be considered free will if it did not have the capability of acting in ways that were not the will of God? <br>  <br>  Once you begin to limit the possibilities I do not think it fits the definition and a '1984esque language limiting technique' is what it sounds to me would be the alternative.<br>  <br>  You have the options you list along with every possible alternative. The admonition to choose wisely is hardly an unbearable one.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I think the whole idea is problematic. If we were created by an omnipotent and benevolent super being in its image it would seem logical it would impart its own nature which supposedly despises evil. In this scenario our free will would most logically mean that we would freely choose to act consistent with our nature which is similar to the god that created us. Instead it seems god gave us natures very different and not in a good way from its own. So is god not omnipotent or is god not so benevolent or is the whole thing mythology?|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Evil may be the most God awful entity in the universe, and it's a pure contrast to God, and a perfect lesson of what happens when you reject God's nature.|`|AA10246871	It's definitely a very costly price to pay, but I'll stick with free will.<br>  <br>  Part of growing as a person is learning to check your desires to do evil. Some people never do learn. Others learn over time. Still others are never even tempted to true evil. It's the learning which counts.<br>  <br>  How can we be free to grow to be good people if we don't have complete free will, including the ability to do evil?<br>  <br>  I read a book a while ago about the genocide in Rwanda. The man who wrote to the book was taken to a village where he interviewed a man who personally killed many of his neighbors and acquaintances with a machete. The man cried as he was interviewed. There will be no punishment for him--the authorities know who he is, but like so many others, they don't have the resources to bring him to trial or punish him, so he wasn't crying from fear. The interviewer asked why he was crying. The man told him this (which was translated, naturally--also, this is not a direct quote, because I remember the substance, but not the exact words): I allowed myself to give in to the evil in myself, and in doing so, I did great evil to people I have known my whole life who never harmed me. I killed people I had eaten with. I killed people with whom I had worked in the fields. I killed people with whom I had shared celebrations and griefs. But I found, afterward, that my sadness for what I had done was matched by another great sadness. In killing them, and acting in an evil manner, I also killed what goodness I had in myself. I can spend the rest of my life trying to help people, and trying to get it back, but I fear it is gone forever. He was not a religious man. He stated that he does not believe that he will be punished by any God, because all Gods act swiftly when they seek retribution, and in the more than ten years that had gone by, nothing bad had happened to him. He doesn't believe he will answer for anything after he dies. He simply mourns the fact that he did evil, because he feels that it killed all the goodness in him.<br>  <br>  I believe in balance. Since I believe in a Divine Creator, that means I must also believe in counterpart which destroys and creates evil. Did God create it on purpose? To me, His simple existence must be balanced by something "other". I don't know if He created it, or if it just IS. But I do know we have been given a choice. And every day, I try to choose that which builds, creates, and nourishes, rather than that which destroys and harms. Some days I do better than others. I do know that the potential for terrible evil exists in me, but so far, I've tried to keep it in check, because I'd rather be free, and have the right to choose, than deal with the alternative.

pOTigVYPaa	Although Jesus knew that he was to suffer and die, to actually experience that was completely different.  He had been up all night without sleep, being slapped, spit upon, beaten, flogged and whipped.  No food, no water; a lot of deprivation all around.  And he was labeled a blasphemer, which was the farthest thing from his mind.  He came to glorify his father, not defame him and yet that is what his enemies labeled him.  During his time of dying, though intellectually he knew his father loved and approved of him, physically he felt completely alone.  His resurrection on the 3rd day was proof that his father had not forsaken him.  Regarding Jesus' statement that His father was always at work till then, but Genesis saying that God took rest from his work on the 7th day, the explanation is that God took leave from creating.  All prior 6 days were working days of creating, but on the 7th day he rested from creating anything more.  All other works continue such as working in our behalf; example:  answering our prayers.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Faulty question.<br>  <br>  - "My God, My God, Why have you forsaken me?" does not equate to "the Father was about to leave Him."<br>  <br>  - On the Sabbath thing, you should be more specific. In the story I'm thinking of he faces Rabbinical challenge for "working" and correctly (in a Rabbinical sense) points out the exigent circumstances demanded he do what he did, that life is not inferior to the Sabbath; rather without life the Sabbath is meaningless.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're thinking of something else. I don't have all the stories in memory but I've heard of Christianity.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	God created the earth and all that is in it in 6 days and rested the 7th. Nowhere in the bible does it say that God takes a rest EVERY sabbath. If He did there would be no point in people praying to Him on the sabbath. The sabbath was made for man because God knew that after 6 days of work man needs a rest. God does not 'need' the rest but at the beginning of the earth as we know it God set a precedent for man to follow, for his own good..|`|pfNnuD5saa	If you read psalm 22<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2022&version=9;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  you will see why Jesus said that.

In the days before Europeans thought of dividing holy scriptures up into chapters and verses (and sometimes butchering the job), people had to cite the phrase they wished to expound upon in order to bring it to the minds of their listeners.  "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me" happens to be the beginning of Psalm 22.  Jesus was giving his final testimony of his father and his own divine mission as savior, pointing out that his death had been prophesied centuries before (and not just in that Psalm, by the way).<br>  <br>  3.

And this is when Jesus stated My God, My God Why have you forsaken me?" the pain that our God felt was greater then anyone could imagine in his heart. For remember that God is a God of love and love us all.

RR|`|AA11452643	When Christ called out to God in this manner, clearly He was consciously quoting this Psalm as an illustration to all that would come after, that He was fulfilling this Old Testament prophecy. This is the key to understanding why the Lord would say this. Jesus Christ, as the living "Word of God" in the flesh, is the application of God's revealed will concerning the atonement for sin by the wrath of God poured out upon man. And His question in Psalms 22:1 of, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me," is answered in Psalms 22:3. <br>  <br>  With regard to work, the Sabbath is the only Commandment of the ten not applicable in the period of Grace.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	first of all, it concerns me that you are trying to prove Jesus was a liar. If you think Jesus was bad, why does it even concern you? <br>  <br>  Jesus is not portrayed in the Bible as being a wicked liar.

I am all alone. come on over.<br>  <br>  Later on, your parents come home and you are not alone. so Jesus was alone, for a reason by the way.

The Father never leaves Him alone.  He was completely forsaken in order to overcome all sin but He is God too so how could He of been left alone.  It's good that you are asking questions about God but know that we can always ask questions to try to disprove the bible.  It sounds like you want to know if the bible is true.  It is.

He had to leave Jesus then, or the punishment for sin would not have been real. The punishment for sin is separation from God, so at the moment he died he had to be separated. Our sin was on his shoulders at that moment, and God cannot be in the presence of sin. <br>  <br>  As for the sabbath, there are two reasons. One, we are commanded not to work on the Sabbath, so that we will have a day to fully spend time with God. When Jesus "broke" the sabbath, he was healing people and preaching. That is serving God, and we are not called to stop serving God on the sabbath. Also, God created the sabbath and he has authority over the Sabbath.

When on the stake, Jesus cried: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” <br>  <br>  Did he lack faith, believing that God had deserted him?<br>  Upon reading these words at Matthew 27:46 or Mark 15:34, some have concluded that when Jesus faced a painful death, his confidence in God wavered. Others have said that this was merely Jesus’ human response, an understandable cry of desperation by a flesh-and-blood man in agony. There is good reason, though, to look beyond such human evaluations based on surface appearances. While none of us today can know with certainty all that was involved in Jesus’ crying out as he did, we can note two likely motives.<br>  Jesus was well aware that he would have to “go to Jerusalem and suffer many things .?.?.?, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.” (Matthew 16:21) In heaven the Son of God had observed even imperfect humans experience torturous deaths while maintaining their integrity. (Hebrews 11:36-38) So there just is no reason to believe that Jesus—a perfect human—would be seized with fear over what he faced; nor would death on a stake suggest to him that his Father had rejected him. Jesus knew in advance “what sort of death he was about to die,” that is, death by impalement. (John 12:32,?33) He was sure, too, that on the third day he would be raised up. How, then, could Jesus say that God had forsaken him?<br>  First, he could have meant it in the qualified sense that Jehovah had taken away protection from his Son so that Jesus’ integrity would be tested to the limit, a painful and shameful death. But God’s releasing of Jesus to the wrath of enemies directed by Satan did not indicate total abandonment. Jehovah continued to show affection for Jesus, as proved on the third day when He raised his Son, which Jesus had known would occur.—Acts 2:31-36; 10:40; 17:31.<br>  Connected to the foregoing is a likely second reason for Jesus’ utterance while on the stake, that by using these words he could fulfill a prophetic indication about the Messiah. Hours earlier Jesus told the apostles that things would happen “just as it is written concerning him.” (Matthew 26:24; Mark 14:21) Yes, he wanted to carry out the things that were written, including things in Psalm?22. You may find it revealing to compare Psalm 22:7, 8—Matthew 27:39,?43; Psalm 22:15—John 19:28,?29; Psalm 22:16—Mark 15:25 and John 20:27; Psalm 22:18—Matthew?27:35. Psalm?22, which gave so many prophetic indications of the Messiah’s experiences, begins: “My God, my God, why have you left me?” Hence, when Jesus cried out as he did, he was adding to the record of prophecies that he fulfilled.—Luke 24:44.<br>  The psalmist did not believe that his God had simply rejected or abandoned him, for David went on to say that he would ‘declare God’s name to his brothers,’ and he urged others to praise Jehovah. (Psalm 22:22,?23) Similarly, Jesus, who knew Psalm?22 well, also had reason for confidence that his Father still approved of him and loved him, despite what God allowed him to experience on the stake.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	IN the seminary we used to mock the hell out of people who gave a sermon and said 'What Jesus MEANT to say..."<br>  <br>  He said what He meant to say !<br>  <br>  <br>  He was quoting Psalm 22. Psalm 22 is the prayer of a just one who suffers innocently, of one who is surrounded by enemies and mocked precisely because of his fidelity to God. When God hears this cry and delivers, the just one offers praise and thanksgiving to God.<br>  <br>  The rest on the 7th day is the same thing. It is in the context of giving the Sabbath Rest a divine exemplar. ALL language about God is imperfect in that way. God ceased working (the same root as Sabbath) and that comes into English as 'rest' (= cease from working) but He doesn't work like we do either, He speaks galaxies into existence with a word. <br>  <br>  You need to read Genesis<br>  <br>  The Pentateuch as Narrative <br>  by John Sailhamer<br>  <br>  <br>  ================<br>  How in this day and age can one ask a question about a book they have not read !!!<br>  <br>  PS Please get rid of the gun...I get the point.|`|tManvxfQaa	Jesus IS God<br>  <br>  YOU need to Learn what Truth is before YOU try to claim it anything else|`|jcK6EXpiaa	These are the types of questions I had before I converted to Islam. I used to identify as Christian, however, I never believed Jesus was the "son" of God (just made no logical sense to me, even when I was small) so, I will anser this question from an Islamic viewpoint. <br>  <br>  I believe the Bible was altered dramatically in the fourth century by Roman Polititions. This FACT is recognised by many Christian Scholars. I will provide their links and resources below. HOWEVER, that is not to say that the Bible is all myth. It is based on holy revelations sent through the Prophet Jeses to humankind from Allah, Jehovah, yehweah (however you call the divine being). Much of the Bible is based on truth, just as the Torah before it. Both were holy books sent from God. Both, however, have been corrupted by humans to suit the needs of greedy monarchs and polititions. Have you ever wondered why there is so much insistance in the Bible that God is the ONLY divine being, yet at the same time, it is claimed that Jesus (pbuh) was the only "son" of God? Have you ever wondered why Jesus is the only one who supposedly makes this claim, when Adam was created in just as miraculous a way? It doesn't add up does it? It is the same with the crucifixion. It never happened. Jesus never died on the cross. God never forsook him. Jesus' image may have been at a crucifixion, but the person itself was not. He was already with God. He did not "rise from the dead" to speak to the people. He merely stayed a while longer to warn the people of his return. Jesus is still alive, right at this moment, waiting to come back and finish his work. He will eventually die, as all of Gods' creatures must, but that death did not happen 2,000 years ago. I know the media makes it out to be insane and scary, and some of the supposed followers do this as well, but Islam is exactly what Christianity is supposed to be. The Quran corrects the mistakes made by humans in the Bible. <br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/584/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/58...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/scholars_refute.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-christianity.com/sc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bible.ca/b-many-versions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.ca/b-many-versions.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allabouttruth.org/versions-of-the-holy-bible-faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allabouttruth.org/versions-of...</a>|`|dbw210qqaa	At that moment, Jesus became sin on the cross for you and for me~God could not look upon sin and if He turns His face away from you, you are doomed; so Jesus suffered this at this point for you and for me so we can have God's abiding presence<br>  <br>  as for the Sabbath, Jesus was showing the "legalists" that a need was more important than their rest|`|0vmQNf0oaa	The Spirit did not leave the body of Jesus.

It is not racist towards Gay people it is a moral issue. Doesn't mean you hate gay people. Just don't want it forced on us. You people calling this person names need to grow up.

QZvvHp3iaa	I don't think it has anything to do with gender, i think it has more to do with personality. You're not saying one day I feel like I want to be a woman and the next I want to be a man. There is nothing wrong with you, it's an identity crisis; you don't know which 'role' to lead and that's fine. I'm assuming you are lesbian, if so, then I do believe it is an identity crisis: Glbt are but into categories, for example gay men are either effeminate or masculine. It's hard when you know you're gay and then you're like ok, now what. Lesbians are either butch or feminine and you know what, you don't have to be either one, you could be both or you could fluxuate with your mood. Don't harp on yourself that you have to identify with one or the other.

My father was a preacher and missionary. We lived in southern Brazil starting churches and building communities. I saw firsthand the incredible power of faith many, many times, and was very devout. <br>  <br>  As adolescence approached, my parents' marriage fell apart, and I soon learned way too much about my father's emotional problems. I was abused for several years, and upon reaching adulthood I forsook my family and religion, believing that they both caused me more harm than good. I could not reconcile the claims of the Bible with my father's actions. <br>  <br>  Through early adulthood, I studied the Bible for all of its inaccuracies and found plenty. I studied the history of religion and encountered horror after horror. I studied other religions in hopes that there was one I could find to be perfect, but was disappointed every time. I began to use only scientific data as an authority, which I felt resisted the corruption of religion. Luckily, I never stopped studying.<br>  <br>  Eventually, I realized that science was corruptable too, that the answers were only as credible as the person giving them. Science has knowledge, but no wisdom. It has understanding, but no perspective. I went back to religious and philosophical writings and slowly came to understand the "mystery," the force that some call God and some call nature.<br>  <br>  I now accept all knowledge and beliefs that attempt to articulate the "mystery," placing most importance on those most valid or functional. I do not care if God doesn't exist because a placebo effect is still a real effect, and I do not care if a particular God does exists because I can only believe in what I think is right, and anyone else who claims authority is suspect. They can only point me in a direction that I will accept or reject; the rest is up to me and whatever God is.|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	people who lose their christian faith, never really had a faith to begin with they try to convince themselves they do. i never really lost mine, i just thought the religion my father forced us to be made no sense and was too judgmental and extreme and was promoting hate.(baptist),so when i grew up i changed to a different religion.(Catholic) but if people don't want to believe in god it is their right to do so not everyone has to believe in a higher power for their existence to make sense to them.|`|AA11937917	I was raised Christian, but it never really seemed real to me. Too many questions could not be answered, too many inconsistencies were being glossed over. More and more, it seemed like Christianity as a whole was a very close-minded, intolerant place (to varying degrees, I must admit - but even more liberal Christians still drew the line at rather arbitrary places, more reflecting their own comfort zones than anything else). I truly tried to believe at various points, but I could never convince myself.<br>  <br>  I spent many years as an atheist, gradually having a series of ideas/epiphanies that I did not equate with spirituality at all - Christianity and monotheism in general had still left their own misdefinitions of what spirituality could be.<br>  <br>  At one point, I came to realize the philosophy I had been developing on my own just happened to coincide with basic neopagan philosophies - and I saw that religion and spirituality was less about "Belief" than Approach. Spirituality is the journey (the asking of questions), not the roadhouse ("answers," especially someone else's that did not fit me).<br>  <br>  In short, I came to understand that placebos, dogmas, doctrines that someone else's interpretations of spirituality... these were all barriers that keep true spirituality hidden from view. Any path that relies on fear, conformity and mind control is not acceptable; these are more about controlling the spirit than liberating it.|`|wM7pprr1aa	I was raised without religious indoctrination (so I wasn't technically a christian) but many of my friends were, so I was essentially a freeform agnostic theist as I grew up (meaning I did not hold that I have absolute knowledge that there was such thing as God(s), but I believed that the idea was likely to be true), but when I was around ten, I was thrust into sunday school by a babysitter. My first real exposure to the systematic religious indoctrination made me curious, so I picked up a bible, read the whole thing, then read it again chapter by chapter in my public library researching each and every historical or scientific statement, and seeing how accurate the Bible really was.<br>  <br>  Then I moved to the Torah, read it through once open minded, then again to compare and contrast it with known fact and it's derivative, the Old Testament. Then treated the Quran the same way, then the Rig Vedas, then the Wiccan Book of Shadows, then the teachings of Buddha, and even the collected works of HP Lovecraft. I looked at what made sense and what had empirical evidence.<br>  <br>  It took 11 years, until I was 21, but I became an agnostic atheist, meaning I do not hold that I have absolute knowledge that there is no such thing as God(s), but until there is empirical evidence for the existence of God(s), I cannot hold the proposition of God(s) to be likely or true.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	when life went down the shithole for no reason, and you see everyone around you sinning as they please and being super happy and suceeding in life. not trying to be "good" is a huge pressure taken off.<br>  <br>  also, seeing people using christianity to protest gays marriage rights.  it pisses me off.<br>  <br>  One Love.<br>  <br>  also, maybe there is A god, but life is easier not thinking the after life.|`|B44nuNU2aa	because it wuz always real iffy    the whole god thing theres no evidence of him just a bunce of guys who wrote a book about a guy who thought he was our saviour he sounds sorta like a charlie manson<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its real creepy if u examine it closely ur just going on faith|`|6bZjBqq4aa	I never actually felt a physical presence or spiritual.

Like talking animals, fairies and such. I just held onto the god beliefs because adults around me were telling me they were true. The skepticism was there though and as I got older and learned more and studied my religion there was just more and more intellectual and psychological conflict. I studied the Bible, my religion and others, as well as philosophy at first looking to shore up faith but I just found no good basis in evidence or fact and finally admitted I really just do not believe it.|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I became a born again Christian as an adult and praised, preached, worshipped and prayed continually though I never saw, felt or heard the Lord.  Throughout the whole experience I had many unanswered bible questions and unanswered prayers that I just put aside.  The deciding factor to walk away was the actions and words of Christians themselves.  Maybe it's because I was part of a fundamental church but I was disappointed in how judgemental many Christians are and how many feel they are superior to others because they alone hold the truth.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: For those who say there are no ex Christians I wonder how they can know the heart of another.  Sadly this is the typical judgmental attitude that turns many away from the religion.|`|4sUek7ugaa	When I was a teenager I was a born-again, spirit filled evangelical, preaching to anyone who would listen to me prattle on about how wonderful my life was and the deep happiness I knew with Jesus in my life.<br>  <br>  Eventually I learned about the mythologies of other cultures in the area at the time and saw how similar they were.  I read the Bible carefully and with an open mind.  Later, I studied the history of the church - the real history, not the whitewashed propaganda taught in churches.<br>  <br>  I had no choice but to conclude that the religion was man-made and my teenage emotions had been manipulated.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	I was raised catholic and forced to go to church and religion classes and I always hated it.

ira6FytEaa	it REALLY helped me realize that God has a plan for us and a reason forall that he does. I had so many things happen to me and i was thinking, why would God let this happen to me? My dad was in jail for a while, he was also a gambler and he lost his job, my great-grandma and my aunt passed away, my grades started slipping from A's to low B's, then in my favorite sport there was a LOT of favoritism played this season. So i felt like i was in a hell hole becasue all of the things i loved had been taken from me; my dad, great-grandma, aunt, grades, and basketball. But after all of that it also helped me realize how blessed i am! it helped me know that God had given me so much and he was just taking back what was his. This really comforted me. I know God is a loving God and he actually took all this suffering i have and help someone else! i felt so happy knowing that god chose me to be the one to help someone else out of their troubles.<br>    So even though all this has happened i'm actually really happy right now becasue it also has showed me how much other people care for me. My principle took away our tuition for the rest of the year and i think for the rest of my high school career and all the teachers are supproting me right now and their praying for me and it has really helped keep me sane in all this. :D<br>   i remember i was so distraught and god led me to the bible and showed me these verses....<br>     Psalms 55:22 "cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you, he never lets the righteous fall."<br>     Jeremiah 17:7 "blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, who puts their faith in him."|`|VyR7efSHaa	I live with daily physical pain.<br>  I live without financial security and security.<br>  <br>  I can do nothing.<br>  Humans can do nothing. <br>  God can do everything - including the impossible.<br>  <br>  He carries me - and makes the bitter - sweet.

Why, because when there is ice on the roads, people tend to be more cautious. <br>  <br>  It's the same way with difficulties. We are closer to God and try to figure out what is necessary to improve when things are difficult. In contrast when things are going well, we tend to forget God and focus on our own happiness. <br>  <br>  For that reason, I think God has to give us those learning periods.|`|E67epIsVaa	suffering has helped me experience God's miraclous power in my life, not only that but in many others ways as well, i now know him as a healer, comforter, savior, etc!|`|t88527U1aa	I was diagnosed with cancer 11 years ago(still kicking) funny how infirmities clear up what is important and what is not!

ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the “salvation” package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have “eternal life” <br>  <br>  John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you (DUCK!), Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<br>  <br>  It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the Host* (*wafer) and Wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL Meat and Holy Blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews! I AM NOT KIDDING!<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died… hey… any little bit of Mafia talk helps to shape the faith as Christians go!).<br>  <br>  The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldn’t stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus’ meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit as the dignified “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world” while grotesquely hanging totally naked nailed to a Holy Cross! There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record, either. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy man’s death hanging from his 2 nailed hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses about the philosophy of life like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the fact that only a bunch of perverts could have possibly dreamed up a religion like Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus’ spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die! <br>  <br>  There is more brutal violence in the Bible than in any TV show. The Bible writers have this God character rewarding people committing the most heinous crimes as long as they do it to further his cause! Islam copied the same idea from the Bible! All the Bible writers picked heroes based on their past bloody criminal performance like Moses, Samson, King David, Saint Paul, just to mention a few. Even the King James Version of the Bible promotes the killing of infants in its fullest CONTEXT! Most Fundie Preachers on the low end of the IQ scale will tell you that the Bible is full of parables and that it can’t be taken literally... short of seriously! It takes many years of schooling and practice to become a professional preacher! They ALL learn how to cover up, give thumbs down and explain away anything objectionable in the Bible! The Bible is obviously of human origin.  Making a statement that it was dictated by a “God” who claims to be full of wrath all the time is an insult to people with a respectable IQ!<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?)! The old Bible strategy of birth control is not abortion, but the killing of infants AFTER THEY ARE BORN and before they grow up and become a menace to God’s chosen people developing WMD or what have you that not even God can defeat!  (Judges 1:19)<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus Christ says in his apocalyptic REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies! (Amen?!) This time it is Sweet Jesus killing the innocent children to announce his 2nd coming and at the same time to teach everybody in the Churches a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Jesus would be in jail for promoting the KILLING OF CHILDREN to favor a particular religion. That’s why the Preachers are so selective in what they teach from the Bible! They came up with the PRO-LIFE bit on their own to dissociate themselves from this REVELATION, and from the routine slaying of children in the Bible, and what’s even grosser yet about cooking and eating them for dinner! All this forced on God’s chosen people for his pleasure! Christianity is a slaughter house religion. No question about it! The Bible writers were very creative about how to call religious people’s attention!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia bosses measure up to this Jesus Christ in the Bible! Christians may expose the Mafia, but they surely LOVE JESUS! And they cover up for him!) <br>  <br>  The story of Jesus was written long after he died (if he ever existed!). He is said to be the greatest religious teacher ever known in the world. Jesus suggested the slaughter by drowning in the middle of the sea of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6). He also suggested the voluntary shedding of offending body parts like an eye, arm, leg or what have you to follow him (Mat 18:8), including male castration (Mat 19:12). Anything to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! Today no teacher cares to be as great as Jesus was or he/she may end up in jail! Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus Christ’s gory suggestions, but throughout the Christian dominated Dark Ages some prominent clergy persons castrated themselves for the “Kingdom’s sake!” Many “witches” and slaves were abused and killed here in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD, too! (Google “Salem witches” and “castrati” in Wikipedia!) So good luck to all of you Christians in your quest for the truth and intellectual satisfaction… or are you after the peace of mind that only religion can offer? Even Jesus says in perfect King James English, “Thou shalt know the truth and the truth shalt set thee free!”|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Helps me to realize that i'm not in control of anything, also is invaluable to me in knowing that my Savior is beside me through it all.

HMteUyRdaa	Jenny, did you know the original OT Ark of the Covenant was carried in an over embellished gold box, very ornate with images on it. The Jewish Temples of the OT were also ornately decorated with images, the Catholic Church given to us by Christ is simply a continuation of the Jewish religion? Jenny, are you sure you know what you are talking about?<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|AA11403222	1 - Catholics are Christians.  In fact, they are the First Christians.  Read Christian history (and I don't mean the New Testament), and you will see that Christianity is the child of Judaism and Paganism.   Because the Catholic church was the ONLY Christian church for centuries, many of their rituals and ideas were taken from the pagan tribes they converted.  This was done to make it easier for those people to accept the new religion.<br>  #2 - Most Catholics who are educated at all realize that much of the symbolism in their religion comes from pagan practices.  I really don't see that as good or bad.  Cannot something be taken from one culture and used for a 'higher purpose' which then makes it 'good'?<br>  #3 - No, statues in a worship building does not make it a temple.  Try telling that to Latter Day Saint and you will get your head bitten off :).<br>  Temple, Church, Mosque, Synagogue - they are all just words for the same thing, a building where people come together to worship their form of Deity.  There is not better about a church, or a temple or a mosque or a synagogue, they are all equal in deity's site.<br>  #4 - To remind you of a saying of Jesus I love to quote to people like who who appear so narrow-minded and petty, and also unlearned - "Judge not, lest ye be judged".<br>  #5 - Did You know that Every Symbol for Easter is Pagan?  And the Christmas Tree?  And even the Story of the Nativity in the Bible? (Luke took that story directly from the story of the god Mithras of the Persian, lock, stock and barrel)  Set your own house in order before you look to set another's in order.|`|AA11796124	Images and Statues<br>  Deut. 4:15 - from this verse, Protestants say that since we saw "no form" of the Lord, we should not make graven images of Him.<br>  <br>  Deut. 4:16 - of course, in early history Israel was forbidden to make images of God because God didn't yet reveal himself visibly "in the form of any figure." <br>  <br>  Deut. 4:17-19 - hence, had the Israelites depicted God not yet revealed, they might be tempted to worship Him in the form of a beast, bird, reptile or fish, which was a common error of the times. <br>  <br>  Exodus 3:2-3; Dan 7:9; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 2:3- later on, however, we see that God did reveal himself in visible form (as a dove, fire, etc). <br>  <br>  Deut. 5:8 - God's commandment "thou shall not make a graven image" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped. <br>  <br>  Exodus 25:18-22; 26:1,31 - for example, God commands the making of the image of a golden cherubim. This heavenly image, of course, is not worshiped by the Israelites. Instead, the image disposes their minds to the supernatural and draws them to God. <br>  <br>  Num. 21:8-9 - God also commands the making of the bronze serpent. The image of the bronze serpent is not an idol to be worshiped, but an article that lifts the mind to the supernatural. <br>  <br>  I Kings 6:23-36; 7:27-39; 8:6-67 - Solomon's temple contains statues of cherubim and images of cherubim, oxen and lions. God did not condemn these images that were used in worship. <br>  <br>  2 Kings 18:4 - it was only when the people began to worship the statue did they incur God's wrath, and the king destroyed it. The command prohibiting the use of graven images deals exclusively with the false worship of those images. <br>  <br>  1 Chron. 28:18-19 - David gives Solomon the plan for the altar made of refined gold with a golden cherubim images. These images were used in the Jews' most solemn place of worship. <br>  <br>  2 Chron. 3:7-14 - the house was lined with gold with elaborate cherubim carved in wood and overlaid with gold. <br>  <br>  Ezek. 41:15 - Ezekiel describes graven images in the temple consisting of carved likenesses of cherubim. These are similar to the images of the angels and saints in many Catholic churches. <br>  <br>  Col. 1:15 - the only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the "image" (Greek "eikon") of the invisible God.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Catholic Christian don't have temples, we have churches.

a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	I'm an agnostic, not an atheist.  But sometimes I feel like an atheist, so here are possible answers:<br>  <br>  1.  Historically, some people who have followed religious teachings have relied rely on those teachings to (a) wage holy wars against unbelievers (b) persecute and even kill people who are accused of practicing witchcraft, (c) persecute and even injure or kill people accused of deviant sexual practices -- e.g. gay men.   <br>  <br>  Some religious people also have historically relied on "holy scriptures" or "God" to "justify" the grossly unequal treatment of women by men and/ or the severe punishment of children by parents. And historically, there have been some times of religious persecution (eg the Spanish Inquisition) in which religion was used to justify torturing people, or even burning them to death for heresy.<br>  <br>  I don't think that's the total story about religion, myself -- I think religious ideas have inspired people to do many, many good things, too.  But it's easy to imagine why some atheists may look at these religiously-justified deeds and consider them -- well, "unholy."<br>  <br>  Kind of the way the ancient Jews decided that human sacrifice, as practiced by the Phoenicians, was an abomination and not a religious duty.<br>  <br>  3.  As an agnostic with a Christian background and ecological concerns, I greatly favor the Jewish prophet Micah's idea that one should "do justice, and love mercy, and walk humbly with your God."<br>  Except that I would add a codicil:  "and try to care for God's creation instead of trashing it."<br>  <br>  I also like Jesus and St. Paul's teaching about "love" and forgiveness being the hallmarks of religion, along with peace-making.  <br>  <br>  I also greatly admire the sentiment in the Proverbs about "whatever you seek, seek first wisdom" and the passage in the Gospel of John about "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."<br>  <br>  The atheist writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr., an admirer of Jesus's ethics, offers some good advice, too:  "Goddam it, you've got to be kind."<br>  <br>  So as an agnostic, I think it makes sense to devote my life at least partly to mercy, justice, love, wisdom and truth.  I'm not saying I always achieve that, but those are goals.<br>  <br>  3.  Since I believe in evolution and I also believe in ecology, I think it's actually important for us all to end up as worm food:  worms are important to soil formation, everywhere on earth, and they need to eat. <br>  <br>  What I think is that since there is no proof of an afterlife, and since there is no reason to believe that either my individual body or my individual spirit will survive my death, the most meaningful thing I can do with my brief life is serve something that might live after me.<br>  <br>  To live "for the whole world," and not just for my individual selfish gratification, is an ideal put forward by the existential philosopher JP Sartre, and I think that makes sense.<br>  <br>  The global ecosystem, the continuation of life on this planet for the next several billion years, is one cause it makes sense for me to serve.  <br>  <br>  The Judaeo-Christian ideals of social justice and mercy and unselfish love are other, less tangible things that I hope will outlive me, and that I should serve -- precisely because my individual personality is no more eternal than "the lilies of the field," to quote Jesus out of context.<br>  <br>  The future of American democracy -- and the continuation of English literature, and world literature -- and the DNA embodied in my family tree are still other things that, if not "eternal," at least have a chance of being long-lasting.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure I do favor the "removal" of religion, though I'd like to see its reformation.  But precisely because I am only a brief wave on a bigger ocean - a momentary idea in the mind of "Brahma," or a momentary collection of chemicals and DNA patterns existing in the global ecosystem -- it behooves me to work for something that's good, that also will outlive me. Including the advancement of society.<br>  <br>  4.  I hope I don't insult religious people, or atheists, either.  I don't especially favor the writings of Christopher Hitchens and other militant atheists on this subject.  I think there are many things -- social justice, mercy, the preservation of the Earth and its peoples and its plants and animals, the rescuing of the US economy from severe recession, the relieving of grotesque poverty in the Third World -- on which atheists and religious people of good faith should be able to agree.  And cooperate.<br>  <br>  But to the extent that there is genuine reason to fear the holy wars, or the sexual intolerance, or the political authoritarianism of religious people, it's easy to see why some misguided atheists feel a compulsion to insult them. <br>  <br>  The rude atheists -- and some sincere Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Buddhists too, I believe -- really do fear the revival of the "holy wars" of the past, and the witch burnings and persecutions of heretics that sometimes accompanied those religious wars.  Fear of tha|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	1.

What a tragedy then it is for people to go through it devoting time and energy to meaningless pursuits and superstitions that prevent them from seeing clearly and understanding the world they inhabit.

Can one ever know true morality or integrity while they are blinded by myth and fantasy? <br>  <br>  2. Live as the change you want to see in the world. Tread gently, respect the rights of others, laugh as often as possible, never miss an opportunity to tell someone you love them and when at all possible, share any skill, knowledge or material wealth. <br>  <br>  3. *boggle*  If you have to ask me why I care to stop the suffering of others, you won't understand the answer. <br>  <br>  4. If they do not want dissenting opinions they should not ask questions in public places. This is not a private Christian forum or chat room. There are plenty of those online. By the way, disagreeing with you is not attacking or insulting you. If you are wounded by the fact you cannot defend your beliefs/delusions logically in a public place, it is your belief system you should be disappointed in, not my honesty.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Believe anything you want. I respect your right to a free and responsible search for the truth. <br>  <br>  But if you had a friend who believed an invisible rabbit who lived in his ear told him what to do and how to vote, would you be concerned for that friend's mental well being? <br>  That is how I feel about theists. <br>  <br>  Again you wonder why I care about other people.

It is to me a worthy and meaningful thing to leave a positive rather then negative legacy with my time here.<br>  <br>  4. I don't do this. I answer mainly questions to atheists. In the last one asking how one can go from Christian to atheist there were several Christians who felt compelled to butt in saying that people who did this were never real Christians.

Cppi6kRFaa	In Norse mythology, Asgard (Old Norse: ásgarer; meaning "Enclosure of the ?sir") is the country or capital city of the ?sir surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a Hrimthurs riding the stallion Svadilfari, according to Gylfaginning. Valhalla is located within Asgard.<br>  <br>  The ?sir go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations<br>  <br>  Now according to this it seems that the tree is actually located in Asgard.

It is located in Asgard which is at the top of Yggdrasil and connected to our world (Midgard) by the Bifrost Bridge.  There are said to be heavens above Asgard, but Asgard is one of the upper worlds along with Vanaheim and Alfheim.  <br>  <br>  The Aesir are the gods led by Odin who supplanted the previous gods, the Vanir.|`|xDfPtDboaa	valhalla is a building, Odin's Hall, within the confines of Asgard, Gard in old norse means an enclosed place,or someplace defended with a wall.

Asgard is one of nine worlds that are all interconnected by the world tree Yggrdrasil, the exact geography of the relationship between the worlds gets kind of fuzzy.|`|rAEBHtjDaa	Valhalla is the hall of the slain, that can be found in Asgard. It's where fallen warriors train until Ragnarok, the end of the world. Asgard is the equivalency of heaven, at the very top of the world tree Yggdrasil. The Aesir are the gods and goddesses that hang out in Asgard, some being Odin, the chief god, Freya, Thor...You may have heard of the Vanir, who are the gods and goddesses that reside in Vanaheim, another of the nine worlds. Aesir and Vanir just denote where these people live.
c3j64eOqaa	Girls, in general, tend to be more social/dependant beings. <br>  <br>  Especially if this is a double date situation, the girls will go into the restroom to discuss the progress of the date, and possibly the next move/tactic, with opinions and final resolutions in tail. <br>  <br>  The tampon and pad reason is really vaild, too.<br>  <br>  It might also be an old Girl Scout instinct...

iZrNlSIJaa	It's called assault and you will go to jail for it, unless they assault you first, in which case it's called self-defense. That person is really is not worth the jail time you will have to do if you assault them. Just try to ignore it as best you can. Acknowledging that person is giving them satisfaction., and that's why they keep doing it. By ignoring them, you are not giving them the privilege of being acknowledged by you. It won't make you look like doormat, and other people will begin to see this person's true colors. It's called "being smarter than what you're working with."|`|4uike3ARaa	Assault and battery, usually a class D felony. It gets worse if you use a weapon (rock, stick, knife, etc). And if you're actually thinking about doing something, quit talking about it.

Simple.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Assault and battery, and yes you will be charged.  It goes back to the old "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me."  There is no defense to resorting to violence because someone called you Mr. Poopypants.|`|WuhIoS1laa	If the person verbally messing with you keeps it up I'd keep reporting to the cops of his continued harassment. <br>  <br>  If you physically initiate a fight, that is assault, and you can be charged and have to appear in court. At which point, you should not be asking for legal advice on Y!A and should hire yourself a lawyer. <br>  <br>  This happened to one of my neighbors who also didn't understand that he was not allowed to push and spit on another resident because he didn't like what she said. <br>  <br>  He was forced by the court to get a lawyer (he showed up in court without one) and then finally go to mediation, and attend anger management classes.|`|ne8mBivvaa	It is called assault.  Could also include battery.  Just because someone uses words against you doesn't mean you have the right to physically attack them.  <br>  <br>  If you are 18 years old or older, you can be charged with assault and spend some time in jail or on probation.  Is it really worth that?<br>  <br>  You can,however, sue them for defamation of character, slander, or libel, if the situation warrants.  <br>  <br>  Just need to remember.....NOTHING gives you the right to put your hands on someone else!|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	You will be charged if you attack someone just because they are insulting you.  It is called assault.<br>  <br>  If you are being harrassed, report them.  If it is at school or at work, file a report.  See that they get written up to the fullest extent possible.<br>  <br>  If they are breaking the law then call the police.<br>  <br>  If they are not breaking the law and you can't get them written up some how, just walk away.<br>  <br>  You will be more of a man for walking a way than by getting into a physical confrontation with them.<br>  <br>  If you win - what if you go to jail or get sued for medical bills?

Even if you win a lawsuit - no amount of money is worth compromising your health.<br>  <br>  What if this person just got laid off and lost his spouse and now he is acting out on you.  How would you feel if you beat the heck out of him and later learned why they were acting out like that?<br>  <br>  Think about the short and long term actions of what you do before you act.  <br>  <br>  Force should only be used for self defense, never in offense.

czXaUPIlaa	Both Taoism and Buddhism share one important quality in common: Both are practice traditions, rather than faith tradition. Both emphasize *doing* rather than believing.<br>  <br>  Many Buddhists, particularly those in the Mahayana tradition, also practice some form of Taoist energy work - certain breathing or energy exercises.<br>  <br>  In Buddhism, especially in Mahayana Buddhism, we practice in order to attain enlightenment and help all beings become free from suffering. <br>  <br>  While Taoism is a more amorphous tradition than Buddhism, the general aim of Taoist practice is more self-centered on longevity, health, personal harmony with circumstances, and simplicity.<br>  <br>  Although Taoism and Buddhism are distinct spiritual traditions, they meet at one point: Zen Buddhism (Ch'an).<br>  <br>  When Buddhism was first introduced to China in the 1st century CE, the Chinese referred to it as "Indian Taoism" because of the apparent strong affinity between the two traditions.<br>  <br>  Taoists took the Buddhist concept of emptiness to mean the same thing as the Taoist notion emptiness. <br>  <br>  This turned out to be an error, since the Taoist notion of emptiness refers to qualities such as restraint, patience, frugality, simplicity, and lack of worldly desire; in Buddhism, emptiness refers to the never ceasing flux of each thing in the universe.<br>  <br>  Probably the two most important Taoist concepts to influence the development of Zen Buddhism are:<br>  <br>  - "Wu wei," or 'not doing.' In Taoism, this doesn't literally mean passivity. It means acting in accord with a situation. Zen internalized this concept as "correct function" -- perceiving how to function correctly, from moment to moment. However, in Zen correct function means acting for the benefit of all beings (bodhisattva action) -- a concept that exists in Taoism but is not central.<br>  <br>  - "Pu," or 'natural state.' Taoist training cultivated "pu," a mental state not confused by thinking, ideas of right/wrong, good/bad, beautiful/or ugly -- just pure awareness. This concept first appears in the Zen tradition through the writings of the 3rd Zen patriarch, Seng-Ts'an, who wrote, "The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. If you wish to see the truth then hold no opinions for or against anything."<br>  <br>  May this answer benefit you!|`|bGUWUgUqaa	For an article about "Dào: The Way, The Great Ultimate, or The Secret of the Universe": <a href="http://chinascope.org/main/content/view/227/148/" rel="nofollow">http://chinascope.org/main/content/view/...</a><br>  <br>  Daoist teaching can be found in Dao Te Ching and Daoist Canon. In order to comprehend the ancient scriptures, you'll need to be an excellent Chinese scholar in Chinese literature. Or you'll need to find a high level Daoist master, who is difficult to come by.<br>  <br>  There is an alternative, you learn about the Taoist belief from the online lecture:<br>  <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/pdf/zfl_new.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/pdf/zf...</a><br>  An excerpt from the Zhuan Falun Lecture about the difference:<br>  "Daoists cultivate True, Good, Endure with an emphasis on being True. That’s why Daoists strive to, “cultivate truth and nourish inborn nature, say true words, do true things, be a truthful person, return to your original, true self, and ultimately cultivate into a True Person.” But they also have Endure, and they also have Good, it’s just that the emphasis is on cultivating the True part. Buddhists emphasize the Good of True, Good, Endure, in their cultivation. Cultivation of Good can develop a heart of great compassion, and once this heart of great compassion comes out you can see that all sentient beings are suffering, so you’ll be filled with one wish: to save all sentient beings. But they also have True, and they also have Endure, it’s just that the emphasis is on cultivating Good. Our Falun Dafa discipline, the Law Wheel Great Way, goes by the highest standard of the universe, to be True, Good, and Endure, and we cultivate these all together. So what we cultivate is huge."

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Short Answer: Hebrew Bible. aka the Torah and the Tanakh, <br>  <br>  LOoong Answer:  The official canon of the Jewish bible was formed and sealed off from change around 100BC. This much later then the texts themselves were actually written.  The Jews did this so ensure changes were not made and to settle disputes over which books were divinely inspired and which were not. <br>  <br>  The Koran wasn't compiled until roughly 750 years later.  or around 653AD. <br>  <br>  And I'm only basing this on when each was canonized. <br>  The texts which eventually became the Hebrew Tanakh are even older.. probably dated between 4,000 and 1,000BC.<br>  <br>  The Christians took the idea of canonization to settle disputes from the Jews and in a series of councils, the Catholic church layed out what was to become the Christian Bible between 250AD and 397AD.  With the final canonization taking place at the council of Carthage in 397AD. <br>  <br>  So even the Christian bible, predates the Islamic Koran by a few centuries.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	The Torah (or "Hebrew Bible" as you put it) was a scroll developed more than 3000 years ago.

Therefore, the Torah is much, much older than the Qu'ran.<br>  <br>  Plus, as one answerer above put it, there is no such thing as the "Old Testament" in the Torah.  That is a term used to describe elements of the Christian Bible taken from the Torah...events of Jewish history before the birth of Jesus.<br>  <br>  The "New Testament' of the Christian Bible was compiled by Emperor Constantine of the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D..

P9S5wlLyaa	Cross-dressers enjoy wearing clothing of the opposite sex. It's not necessarily a fetish, just something they enjoy. Drag queens are cross-dressers who preform, on stage or otherwise. Technically,  transvestism is transvestic fetishism, in which transvestic behaviour is coupled with, and often necessary for, sexual arousal.<br>  <br>  In reality, the two terms can be used as one and the same, although most straight cross-dressers prefer that term to transvestite.<br>  <br>  The majority of transvestites/cross-dressers are probably straight, actually. To enjoy or be aroused by wearing women's clothing does not at all require that you are attracted to men.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in the subject, I suggest you aquire a copy of 'The Man in the Red Velvet Dress: Inside the World of Cross-Dressing'.

He pre-existed. Similarly he was despatched through human agency but he survived it exacly as foretold throughout the ancient scriptures of Isaiah 53 etc. Throughout Biblical writings we have clear reference to The Messiah being the express image of God..Without beginning and without end.Alpha and Omega.<br>  If you do not believe in His divine origin then the birth of Jesus may still have some significance as a teacher. His premature death would not be so important.<br>  <br>  If you believe His claims however then everything He did through His lifes work and sacrifice is inseparable. One without the other would not make sense. Indeed it would be contradictory.|`|6ead7e745899491ccfd40dbc9c7d5ef6aa	His death. Why? Because not only did he die for all of sinful humankind (and the majority don't even appreciate it) but he fufilled his heavenly Father's purpose. That is the most important thing.<br>  <br>  Besides providing the means for Jesus to set an example for us on Earth, his birth isn't very significant. As a baby, Jesus didn't perform miracles or speak about his father's kingdom.That doesn't mean we don't appreciate it, it just means his death is of greater importance. That is why Jesus instructed his true followers to observe it every year. - John 3:16, Luke 22:19|`|YtqN2Xdpaa	both and also his resurrection.  Christ's birth is important because it signifies his humble/servant character as an example for us(Phil 2:5-11).  Christ left his throne to be born as a human in order to be a loving sacrifice for sinners to the calvary where he was crucified.  Christ's resurrection tells us Christ is God and lives because He promissed us eternal life, his guidance, his love, the answering of our prayers and so He is keeping all He's said.  His life on earth and beyond is an example of what a christian life should be... a sinner becomes a child of Christ, is being crucified to the cross everyday(Gal 2:20) and will die of the flesh, but will live as Christ our Lord(1 Thess 4:13-18 ).<br>  <br>  Phillippians2:5-11 <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:5-11&version=31" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  Galatians 2:20 <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:20&version=31" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  1 Thess 4:13-18 <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%204:13-18%20&version=31" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a>|`|2B6F5Zhtaa	someone said his resurrection, and they are wrong!<br>  <br>  Ofcourse it was has death, if you believe it, then jesus dies on the cross, one of the worst ways to be killed, to forgive all of mankind of its sin, and to give mankind a new way to communicate and to have a relationship with god, which before jesus died was not possible!<br>  <br>  What will be more significant will be when he coems again, as all christians such as myself believe will happen|`|zp7aW6o7aa	Neither.<br>  <br>  His resurrection was his whole purpose of life.

He was taught and loved by God, as Jesus loved God over the world.  Jesus knew his calling and his faith has never been matched as for his faith in God.<br>  <br>  Jesus taught truths, through his words which, still not many truly understand.  For they are taught by worldly taught men, and not God.   Yet his light still shines on Gods chosen and the world knows not.

Jesus was teaching his last long lesson on different subjects. He was getting so unstable that he lost track of the questions that his disciples were asking him…<br>  <br>  John 13:36 (NIV) Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"<br>  <br>  John 14:5 (NIV) Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" <br>  <br>  Jesus didn’t answer them, but towards the end of this last training class Jesus is complaining that nobody is asking him where he is going!!!<br>  <br>  John 16:5 (NIV) Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, “Where are you going?”* (*At this point Saint Peter and Saint Thomas started to bang their heads against the wall).<br>  <br>  Obviously Jesus was so depressed about dying that he just couldn’t remember anything anymore. Then he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane sweating tear drops of blood in desperate fear of dying for anybody! He was in need of a comforter, but God the Holy Ghost, aka “Another Comforter” was nowhere to be found! Instead an angel creature of God showed up (with a box of napkins?)… The Preachers are covering up the fact that Jesus was yellow-bellying at the idea of going to the Holy Cross!<br>   <br>  Luke 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<br>  <br>  BTW, Jesus started to shed blood even before going to the Holy Cross, but the savvy theologians are saying that this blood was worthless to save anybody from their sins. The Blood of Jesus had to flow freely from his limbs while nailed to the Holy Cross! The Roman soldier that poke a spear into Jesus’ right side rib cage drew WATER that had nothing to do with any plan of salvation!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 5:7-8 (NIV) During the days of Jesus' life on earth, HE OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND PETITIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO THE ONE WHO COULD SAVE HIM FROM DEATH* (*This Son of a God is not an atheist in a foxhole! I never heard an atheist doing this number in a foxhole!), and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON, HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE* (Yeah… naughty Jesus! God the Father up in the sky taught him a lesson just for the heck of it “because it pleased God!”) FROM WHAT HE SUFFERED* (*the Bible writers were not too careful writing about Jesus credentials, but the Christians today are willing to kill to defend what the preachers tell them! I know that Islam is much worse, but that is not an excuse to pick the Christian religion or “Jesus” or any religion at all! A lot of high profile people are declared Christians and they won’t be the first ones to change even if they figure out that Christianity is the biggest scam in the world today!)<br>  <br>  I can almost still hear Jesus crying out loud! That is probably why Jesus didn’t spend the promised full 3 days and 3 nights in Hell, but only 2 nights, one day and hardly any time of the first and last day. Jesus Christ was really horrified to die for anybody! The FUNNIEST JOKE ON JESUS that any Christian could possible dream up is the fancy artistic rendition of the Holy Cross that killed him!  It now identifies Christianity!  Showing a dead body hanging on any cross is too gross for a lot of Christians so the Protestants do not recognize the Crucifix, but only the empty Cross.  The absurd worship of so many crosses of Jesus proves the sadomasochistic orientation of the Christian religion… it is barbaric! Jesus flesh is beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit in preparation for hanging totally naked on a Holy Cross as the “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! The next time that a sweet Catholic lady or nun prays before a crucifix she ought to know that the diaper is NOT there! She can go ahead and ask the Pope if the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victims with a white clean diaper before they crucify them!   <br>  <br>  No wonder the Bible writers have Jesus sweating TEARS OF BLOOD begging his Father in Heaven “to pass the cup”. It would have been much easier if God the Father would have assigned a “Guardian Angel” to protect Eve from eating a fruit from the wrong tree! That would have saved the WHOLE world that God loves so much without killing any member of the Holy Trinity! You have to have a specially conditioned stomach and a pervert mind to be a Christian! No wonder they call it the “Slaughter House Religion”! In spite of all the virtual suffering of Jesus Christ Saint Paul comes along later on and finishes WHATEVER PAIN JESUS STILL HAD TO SUFFER IN HIS OWN FLESH for the sins of the “elect” and for their salvation so they can go to Fairy Heaven when they die!<br>  <br>  Colossians 1:24 (NIV) Now I* (*Saint Paul) rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I FILL UP IN MY FLESH WHAT IS STILL LACKING IN REGARD TO CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS, for the sake of “his body, which is the church”.* (*crappy talk, but what the heck!)<br>  <br>  For his work the Bible writers have God rewarding Saint Paul with the "STIGMATA"* (*the marks of Jesus crucified). He was the first Christian to get it!<br>  <br>  Galatians 6:17 (NIV) FINALLY, let no one cause me trouble, for I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS. (“I lie not!” –Saint Paul)<br>  <br>  You ought to know that atheists do know how to read the Bible the way it is… not the way it has to be read according to the dogmas of a particular Church brand. The Bible is full of Holy Religious Crap on/in every page! Christians need to have preachers telling them what Christianity ought to be all about because MOST CHRISTIANS don’t read the Bible and those who do follow a poached list of verses to be read on specific days of the week! There is no need to read anybody’s book to know what the Bible is all about. It suffices to read the Bible carefully and objectively! It is all in the Bible! I know that thousands if not millions of free loaders are making a living on any religion, especially the “Jesus” religion… They managed to convince a lot of people and even national leaders in this world that the Clergy and the Preachers speak for a higher authority!|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	His mum|`|o8gMUq9Uaa	death.nuff sed|`|QLDMmp6Taa	C.

6nWGMP5Laa	i dont walk inside home with shoes its not common in our home to walk around with shoes at home:)|`|qky7gWosaa	It is required in my family to remove the shoes when entering the house. We take off our shoes the minute we step in the house, since it is a sign of respect. Also, shoes can lead to dirtying the carpet, and personal hygiene is taken prominently in my house - we have to be clean and refreshed in front of other family members. I also take off my shoes in other homes, since it is a indication of deference.|`|QIgrBrFdaa	Nope, my mom takes alot of care into keeping the house clean, it's just rude for me to be walking around in my shoes !<br>  <br>  Yeah me too...

Z9jtdw17aa	When you say "head of household," you mean who is "boss."<br>  <br>  It's probably difficult for someone with a very hierarchical view of the world to accept, (God to priest to husband to wife to child to dog) but there is no one boss in our household based on an arbitrary authority.<br>  <br>  The problem being solved determines who the authority is or where the authority lies.  <br>  <br>  In issues regarding economic choices, my husband asks me to review his accounts, but he keeps the accounts.  We discuss things like budgets and household expenses, but he is better at analysis, so he has more say than I do.  If I am strongly in favor of or strongly against a course of action contrary to his,  he considers it strongly, and usually either has a reason sufficient to convince me of his view or modifies his own.<br>  <br>  In issues of design, decorating, art or marketing, I have more say than he does, although I try to take his tastes into account.  He isn't an artist, so doesn't claim expertise in design of the garden or decorating the living room.  He doesn't "get" what gives a house curb appeal, so he defers to my choices there.  <br>  <br>  Our philosophy of investing is very similar because each of us talks to the other about what we are thinking.  Our taste is similar, and we know what our budget limits are, so we rarely have disagreements on such issues.<br>  <br>  If we are doing the laundry, we do it my way.  If we are maintaining the cars, we do it his way.  If we are picking an activity for our afternoon's entertainment, our son gets a chance to choose, just as each of us do.<br>  <br>  Arguments are rare, and usually only happen if we are both tired.  If I am tired and snappish, but he is feeling well, he says, "What is really bothering you?"  If he's tired and snappish when I'm feeling well, I say, "Why don't you sit down and listen to the TV a while.  I'll get you something to eat."    We learned long ago that when he is angry, he wants to be left alone.  When I am angry, I want to be comforted and reassured that I'm loved.  If we are both angry at the same time, we agreed about 20 years ago to a procedure:  He gives me a hug and confirms that he loves me even if he is angry.  Then he leaves the room or rolls over onto his side with his back to me.  I've gotten my affirmation, so I can let go.  He's left alone so he can calm himself and let go.<br>  <br>  It isn't a perfect system, but it works pretty well for us.<br>  As to who gets the last word...It depends on who says, "Yes, Dear" soonest.|`|cO8b7Pniaa	Well like Joshua said, ...choose you this day whom you will serve, but as for me and my household we shall serve the Lord...joshua 24v15<br>  <br>  Since in my household we decided to serve the Lord we take what He says to heart and every word of the Lord is pure and right. If the Lord says that a wife is to submit to her husband, just as Sarah called Abraham "Lord", then obviously he (my husband) is the head of the house. <br>  <br>  Also, just like the bible says, just like Christ is over the church so is the man over his wife or house, so be it. I follow the bible 100%. Not saying that i walk around calling my husband "lord" or anything, it's just that i know who he is after and i will follow him as he follows Christ which ultimately leads to the father. <br>  <br>  Like i always tell him, you maybe the head but i am the neck.|`|WmZqykz1aa	My brother-in-law (a Methodist) was fond of saying, "If Momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy."<br>  <br>  He did what he had to do to keep my sister happy, and it must have worked.  They'd been married happily more than 35 years at the time of his passing.<br>  <br>  A Christian former co-worker who lives in Kentucky told me once about her "husband as head of household" theory with firm conviction.  I've never met a more hen-pecked man in my life than that woman's husband.<br>  <br>  I think it would vary for each household, but most atheists are going to be much less concerned about formal hierarchy than a Christian household in theory, but practice...well....if Momma ain't happy, ain't no one going to be happy.|`|zq8s9gtwaa	It varies from home to home because we are all very different. Mine is actually fairly democratic plenty of referendums here. But as the main breadwinner and owner of money the old man had the final say. Of course this is just an illusion really the woman usually has the power this case is no different.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	It depends on the individual atheist, but in my household, the parents have the last say (i.e., my wife and myself).<br>  <br>  Some families don't need to have a "final say" in arguments.  Couples who resepect each other resolve issues together and find compromises.|`|JAZqgHpGaa	Seriously, what planet are you on?<br>  <br>  Head of household?<br>  What?  You need hierarchy?<br>  <br>  Why in the world would any woman be religious?

The wife does not inherit from her husband, nor daughters from their father, except when there is no male heir.

The name derives from the Latin tunica commonly worn by both men and women in Ancient Rome, which in turn is based on earlier Greek garments.<br>  <br>  The Roman tunica was worn by citizens and non-citizens alike; citizens, though, would wear it under the toga, especially at formal occasions. The length of the garment, the presence or lack of stripes, as well as their width and ornamentation, would indicate the wearer's status in Roman society. Soldiers, slaves and manual workers generally had tunics to a little above the knee; those in more sedentary occupations to about the ankle (unless they were expecting to ride a horse, when a shorter one would be worn).<br>  <br>  romans tunic The tunic was also worn by the ancient and Byzantine Greeks and is very similar to the chiton, which looked like a jacket. In Ancient Greece, a person's tunic was decorated at the hem-line to represent the city-state in which he lived.

Your glasses tell me you either have a vision problem or you like to look sophisticated.  Your facial expression tells me that you are not very happy, or like to look very serious in front of the camera.Fat? I don't see that. I think you're beautiful the way G-d made you.

iZrNlSIJaa	Leave that part out. Resignation letters need to be professional, and bringing up personal issues is not professional. What you write in that letter may come back on you later, especially if your next prospective employer contacts your current one. This often helps in making the decision to hire.|`|xnsU60hhaa	Leave it out. This is your resignation letter, so keep it simple. Just dates and thank you for the opportunity, it has been a pleasure, etc.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	That's not needed in this letter.  Just your  resignation, as of such and such date.<br>  Never add info that isn't called for.|`|SkOALXv9aa	When writing a resignation letter it is always wise to not burn bridges.<br>  <br>  State your reason for leaving as being in the best interest of your career advancement.  You can also say something nice about those you have had an opportunity to work with and to learn from.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with what you wish to include.  That would always leave the door open should you think about returning one day in the future.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Resignation is always a matter of "least said soonest mended" just write a letter tendering your resignation and asking for formal confirmation of your end date.<br>  <br>  You never know when what you write might come back to haunt you.<br>  <br>  Then move on babe.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I would just say that you appreciated ____ and _____'s help.

A resignation letter is a notice to your employer that you intend to terminate your employment, specifying the date and a "brief" explanation as to why you are resigning. This is not the time to include any personal feelings as to third parties. <br>  <br>  If you have a problem expressing your appreciation in person, write or purchase the parties a thank you note/card expressing your appreciation for their help. I'm sure they would appreciate this more than getting it second hand from your boss.  Make sure your messages are personal to the person, in other words do not write the same comment to each party.  Hope this helps.  Take Care.|`|ftIUXfK7aa	I'd go to the people concerned directly if I was you as whatever the issue is, it's clearly playing on your mind. It's not really necessary to put something like that in a letter of resignation. Best to keep is short, sharp and to the point with the obligatory "I've enjoyed my time with_______ and will be sad to leave" etc to make sure you get a good reference!<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you're going on to.|`|8OREBeRdaa	A resignation letter is a courtesy to the employer letting them know you are quitting your job.  You only need to put in the fact that your leaving and on what date.  I wouldn't get into the whole thing about thanking others.  <br>  <br>  Send those individuals a Thank You card for appreciation.|`|VzmUoyzJaa	Perhaps you could leave it out and write both of them a personal private letter to express your thanks|`|fBti22TAaa	'I hereby give notice that I shall leave my post as ......... on such and such a date.<br>  <br>  Yours faithfully etc'<br>  <br>  That's all that's needed.|`|wwiBbCR7aa	Being positive is always good, and puts you in a good light too.|`|kew2l7Acaa	Seems fine, it's not like you're being nasty or anything.

The government ought not use it coercive power to restrict activities unless those activities are substantially likely to cause significant harm to others.|`|JnXmSLDfaa	My first reaction about the sale of gametes was against, very negative.  Then, thinking it over, I've changed my mind.  Many people know without any doubt that they have situations that should not be genetically passed on in the human race - tazaks, low intellect, learning disabilities, and any and all of the horrible health conditions that are passed on to each new generation, like hemophilia.  <br>  <br>  Still, many people want children, healthy children, and our entire civilization profits from each generation of healthy, intelligent additions to the gene pool and the elimination of low mentality and certain diseases.  It just makes sense for these people to have access to healthy gametes, and to fulfill their lives also with children as a result of this sharing from other humans.  <br>  <br>  There's no such thing as ''moral'' .  That's just childish and primitive thinking.  There is 'smart' and there is 'stupid'.  Our race the human race had better start getting 'smart' in our breeding or we'll overwhelm ourselves with a subculture of sickness and disease and mental illness that could have been prevented and kept out of the gene pool, or we will go extinct just like so many other species before us.|`|0lxfBkQAaa	NOBODY WILL DONATE A LIVING BODY PART EVENTHOUGH<br>  IT MAY BE SAFE.<br>  MY EXPERIENCE IS PEOPLE REQUISING SURGERY HAVE FEAR TO GET IT DONE, SO HOW CAN THEY ALLOW A PRICK TO REMOVE THE OVA AND TAKE MEDICINE.<br>  COME ON ITS NOT ONLY MARKET, BUT SOME DO DONATE WITH EMOTIONAL FEELING.|`|oTmylEGUaa	Probably against it I guess.

FOzN3xwzaa	"Faith without works is dead" is only for getting rewards in heaven, NOT for getting into heaven.  So you're misunderstanding the verse. <br>  <br>  The ONLY WAY to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing in Jesus alone for salvation. And when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, then you will NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|pLZlWmeZaa	my friend u don't half to be afraid of going to hell there is no physical hell.

a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	There is the tradition that Moses wrote the first five books, but I have my doubts since there are two obvious authors of Genesis, and multiple sources for the others.  I have the feeling the rest are like most of the literature that came out of that time period--word of mouth stories that were finally written down.|`|UDEMDcGuaa	The most important issue would seem to be the length of the period between the actual events and the setting of them down in writing. Internal evidence in the books themselves suggests that events of the Hebrew monarchies period were set down by royal scribes soon after they happened, and the writer(s) of the Book of Kings had direct access to these writings and quoted extensively from them—whereas earlier events, such as the Exodus and the Conquest, might have spent centuries as oral traditions before a written account of them was set down, which might make the written account considerably different from any actual events that gave the original basis to the tradition.|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	You can be fairly sure it was all written by the priests since they were the only ones with an education. Most of the early stuff was probably handed down through oral tradition until they developed written language.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Moses summarized history and theology up to his time in a rather condensed and sometimes allegorical manner.

Moses wrote (the first??) five books of the OT, I think Joshua wrote some of his own book, David did most of the psalms, Solomon did most of Proverbs, Song of Solomon, and Lamentations, (maybe all of it?)

Other stories are newer. Unlike the NT, the Jews never stopped keeping records and even have new books that have are written about modern times.

It was relevant to the character he played,  and the movie for which he starred and was awarded for.    I say good for him.<br>  <br>  Plenty of people in the media use the podium to express their belief in god and jesus and it is downright annoying and totally irrelevant to the situation.|`|w98UhLWvaa	He said that because there were people outside the Kodak theatre with signs saying that Heath Ledger was in hell for his portrayal of a gay person.   So if anyone was promoting sin and immorality...it would be those on the picket line.  Promoting hate can be considered a sin.|`|AA11502346	Yes, I do.  Heck, Hollywood itself is a cesspool of sinful activity.  But then again, so is the entire human race so I can't be judgemental on Hollywood alone.  <br>  <br>  Some non-believers don't have the grasp of what is right and what is wrong.|`|NXCMRb8waa	I think he was the only sane person at the Academy Awards.<br>  <br>  Also unlike most Christians, he understands the US Constitution.|`|x3ZpztsVaa	"....It was voted NO on gay Marriage in California cause the Bible states that marriage supposes to be man and woman..."<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't even acknowledge the existence of the American continent, let alone California....<br>  <br>  Your Q is way too moronic...|`|bVHnNqzBaa	No, sweetie. Homosexuality is no more of a sin than is eating shrimp.|`|O5KOwhovaa	No, he used the Academy Awards to promote rational thought and equal treatment of human beings.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	He used his speech to fight ignorance, hatred and bigotry.

The trend is towards more acceptance of gays, and I think there will be backlashes but the trend is irreversible.  Milk is about the first openly gay man elected to public office in the US.  At the time that seemed outrageous to some people, but now its no big deal.  <br>  <br>  This was at a time when homophobes were saying that all gays were pedophiles, but they don't say that anymore.  In Florida they passed a law to not allow gays to be teachers, and there were similar ballot initiatives around the country.  That issue has been solved, though.  I think it shows we're making progress.<br>  <br>  Gay marriage is the big issue now for gays, and Penn was just expressing his own feelings about it.  I don't think gays are sinful or immoral.  Any more than the rest of us.  And I think it's just a matter of time before their rights are recognized by all.|`|AA11058044	How is that promoting sin and immorality in any way?<br>  <br>  Do you truly think that legalizing gay marriage would somehow increase the amount of homosexual sex that is occurring?<br>  <br>  If heterosexual marriages are any indication, then the best way to eliminate homosexual sex acts is to make them get married.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	No, I think he used the Academy Awards as a medium to disseminate a message of peace, love and tolerance.  Are these things sins in your religion?|`|hiCSVwchaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I think he used it to advance human rights.|`|WalnRzfGaa	No he used it to try and stop the pread of hatred and ignorance.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	"Sin and immorality according to the bible."<br>  <br>  We don't live in a theocracy.

Many of the Gay people who wish to be married also serve the community.  They are cops, soldiers, fire fighters, nurses, doctors, teachers, political leader, etc.  Who are you to judge them?  And please, don't deny you are doing so by pointing to the Bible and saying "God said it".  Bull ****.  You're the one on here posting the question.  YOU are the one being judgmental.  You're also being selective in your moral outrage.   You're cherry picking portions of the bible to object to while ignoring others, such as that say it's a sin to work on the sabbath, a sin punishable by death(Exodus 35:2).  Where is your outrage over the fact that people were working on the sabbath to put on the academy awards ?  Where is your outrage over the sin committed by the camera man, the director, the producer, the sound man, the back stage people, the reporters covering the event, etc, etc, etc?  A lot more people commit the "sin" of working on the sabbath than commit the "sin" of being gay.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Not at all. He used the opportunity to promote equality and to condemn bigotry.

The Kraken is a medieval legend, not an ancient Greek one. The monster ravaging Ethipia had no name. Perseus made the Graea help him find the Gorgons. They had just one eye and one tooth that they passed around, and Perseus took these things. He didn't return them until the sisters told him what he wanted to know. There were three Gorgons who turned anyone to stone who looked at them. Medusa was the mortal one. Perseus had a polished shield he used as a mirror to kill Medusa without looking at her. He wore Hades' helmet that made him invisible, so the other Gorgons couldn't find him. There's no Calibos in the story or in any other greek tale. He may've been inspired by Caliban in Shakespear's plays. There weren't any giant scorpions in the story of Medusa. Her blood falling to earth brought forth some scorpions and such pests but not giant ones. Chrysaor her son by Poseidon also fell to earth when she was killed. You can't take movies seriously. They all change the original stories to suit themselves.

As living beings, we have gotten to where we are by LIVING and purposefully stopping living is not a good survival trait.<br>  <br>  BTW: Their bible does not say that it is a sin to commit suicide.|`|EVby6dGCaa	What it is in God's eyes, no one can tell but God alone.<br>  <br>  The reason people are not comfortable with suicide is that life is a gift from God, and even in a situation where life sucks and isn't going to get better (like an advanced case of cancer, say), it is still not right to throw that gift away.<br>  <br>  There are some, however, who would say that by the time it gets to that point, the "gift" aspect of life has become such an obscene caricature of what it once was that the ban on taking one's life is not nearly so stringent.<br>  <br>  The hard-line conservatives will say, the rule is never commit suicide, and that's it. The rule never changes; more reasonable people think that God is far more understanding than that, and if one's life has become a living hell -- with no hope of an exit -- then it's quite acceptable to end one's life. That's why several up-to-date countries, as well as some states in the USA have legalized medically assisted suicide.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Murder is the taking of a life, Taking ones own life is self murder|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	Thou shalt not kill.<br>  <br>  And it's not only that, but you don't have a chance to ask forgiveness.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	its just like murder.....|`|uOwgkwTLaa	Because he created you for a purpose and you should not end your life just because you are blue or depressed.

There are often other situations to take into consideration; such as is the person in such pain they find life unbearable, or is the person of mental fitness to make such a decision?<br>  <br>  What it all boils down to is your own faith in the God you create in your mind.  If your own belief structure tells you it is wrong, then it is wrong and there is no other way around it.  But if your belief structure is more compassionate and understanding, then you will have wiggle room.<br>  <br>  As far as the bible is concerned, it does indeed say killing of any sort is wrong.

I have the answer but thought you may want the following question answered first. This is a chapter from a book. I can get it for you if you want one...there is no charge. email me at spreadingoodnews@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chapter Eleven<br>  Why Does God Allow Suffering?<br>  Has God caused the suffering in the world?<br>  What issue was raised in the garden of Eden?<br>  How will God undo the effects of human suffering?<br>  AFTER a terrible battle in one war-torn land, the thousands of civilian women and children who had been killed were buried in a mass grave surrounded by markers. Each marker bore this inscription: “Why?” Sometimes that is the most painful question of all. People ask it sadly when war, disaster, disease, or crime takes their innocent loved ones, destroys their home, or brings them untold suffering in other ways. They want to know why such tragedies befall them.<br>  2 Why does God allow suffering? If Jehovah God is all-powerful, loving, wise, and just, why is the world so full of hatred and injustice? Have you ever wondered about these things yourself?<br>  3 Is it wrong to ask why God allows suffering? Some worry that asking such a question means that they do not have enough faith or that they are showing disrespect for God. When reading the Bible, however, you will find that faithful, God-fearing people had similar questions. For example, the prophet Habakkuk asked Jehovah: “Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful, and you keep looking upon mere trouble? And why are despoiling and violence in front of me, and why does quarreling occur, and why is strife carried?”—Habakkuk 1:3.<br>  4 Did Jehovah scold the faithful prophet Habakkuk for asking such questions? No. Instead, God included Habakkuk’s sincere words in the inspired Bible record. God also helped him to get a clearer understanding of matters and to gain greater faith. Jehovah wants to do the same for you. Remember, the Bible teaches that “he cares for you.” (1?Peter 5:7) God hates wickedness and the suffering it causes far more than any human does. (Isaiah 55:8,?9) Why, then, is there so much suffering in the world?<br>  WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?<br>  5 People of various religions have gone to their religious leaders and teachers to ask why there is so much suffering. Often, the response is that suffering is God’s will and that he long ago determined everything that would ever happen, including tragic events. Many are told that God’s ways are mysterious or that he brings death upon people—even children—so that he can have them in heaven with him. As you have learned, though, Jehovah God never causes what is bad. The Bible says: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!”—Job 34:10.<br>  6 Do you know why people make the mistake of blaming God for all the suffering in the world? In many cases, they blame Almighty God because they think that he is the real ruler of this world. They do not know a simple but important truth that the Bible teaches. You learned that truth in Chapter?3 of this book. The real ruler of this world is Satan the Devil.<br>  7 The Bible clearly states: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1?John 5:19) When you think about it, does that not make sense? This world reflects the personality of the invisible spirit creature who is “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation 12:9) Satan is hateful, deceptive, and cruel. So the world, under his influence, is full of hatred, deceit, and cruelty. That is one reason why there is so much suffering.<br>  8 A second reason why there is so much suffering is that, as discussed in Chapter?3, mankind has been imperfect and sinful ever since the rebellion in the garden of Eden. Sinful humans tend to struggle for dominance, and this results in wars, oppression, and suffering. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) A third reason for suffering is “time and unforeseen occurrence.” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) In a world without Jehovah as a protective Ruler, people may suffer because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>  9 It is comforting for us to know that God does not cause suffering. He is not responsible for the wars, the crimes, the oppression, or even the natural disasters that cause people to suffer. Still, we need to know, Why does Jehovah allow all this suffering? If he is the Almighty, he has the power to stop it. Why, then, does he hold back? The loving God that we have come to know must have a good reason.—1?John 4:8.<br>  A VITAL ISSUE IS RAISED<br>  10 To find out why God allows suffering, we need to think back to the time when suffering began. When Satan led Adam and Eve into disobeying Jehovah, an important question was raised. Satan did not call into question Jehovah’s power. Even Satan knows that there is no limit to Jehovah’s power. Rather, Satan questioned Jehovah’s right to rule. By calling God a liar who withholds good from his subjects, Satan charged that Jehovah is a bad ruler. (Genesis 3:2-5) Satan imp

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	1) Mat 23:9-10)  in the same sentence Jesus says "Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Messiah." Using this passage to claim that we cannot call a priest "father" would mean that we could not call professors at college, or Pastor's or teachers,  "instructors." as well. Which most would see as quite silly. <br>  <br>  Catholics don't believe Jesus was forbidding the use of "father" in that passage. There are plenty of examples in the Bible where that the word "Father" applies to humans, and the Bible links the priesthood to fatherhood. Fr. Mateo writes:<br>  <br>  "In Judges 17:10, the Ephraimite Micah asks a transient Levite, "Stay with me; be father and priest to me." Later (Judges 18:19), a Danite war party persuades the same Levite to leave Micah, saying: "Come with us and be our father and priest." Indeed, the Bible finds priesthood and fatherhood inseparably united. <br>  <br>  St. Paul says he is the father of his Christian converts (1st Thess. 2:10-11). Acts calls Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David fathers (4:25, 7:2, 8, 14). Paul says Timothy is his son, and he (Paul) is Timothy's father (Philip. 2:22). Reading Hebrews 12:9 reminds us of those spankings we used to get from our fathers! 1st John 2:13, 14 twice calls certain members of the congregation fathers. <br>  <br>  Every Catholic priest is ordained in Christ to say, "In Christ Jesus I became your father through the Gospel" (1st Cor. 4:15). A priest is sent "to deal with us as a father deals with his children, encouraging, comforting, and urging us to live lives worthy of God" (1st Thess. 2:11-12).<br>  <br>  Catholics believe the fulcrum of Mat 23:9-10 is "The greatest among you will be your servant." (Mat 23:11)  Catholics don't think Jesus was against priests, he was against hypocritical priests. Jesus was condemning the hypocrisy of unholy men who were in office at the time, he was not condemning their office. I believe that's how God felt 2000 years ago and that is how he feels today. And yes there have always been some bad priests. Judas was the first bad priest in the Christian tradition, but the other disciples were good men. Jesus makes it very clear that he is not condemning the office of scribes and Pharisees'. He was not saying that we should throw out the idea of an organized clergy. He had a great respect for their office.<br>  <br>  "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses seat; therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it, " (Mat 23:2)"<br>  <br>  You see as Catholics,  we believe in the ENTIRE bible, we don't single out individual verses..we interpret the verses in FULL context,  consistent with ALL verses.  So if any verse talks about calling someone father, then we have to re-look at the verse which says not to, and interpret BOTH verses consistently.<br>  _____________________<br>  2) Is the point of Matt. 6:7 that Repition in itself is bad.. OR is the point of the verse "vain repetition" ?  Is there a difference between repition and vain repition?  Is saying to someone,  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Please forgive me, OH my GOSH I am soo sorry,  I'm sorry, Please forgive me"  Vain repition or a FORM of SINCERITY??<br>  <br>  Protestants use this verse to criticize various Catholic forms of prayer which repeat phrases, such as litanies and the Rosary. <br>  But Jesus' focus in this instruction is on the "vain," and not on the "repetition."<br>  <br>  Matt. 26:44 - for example, Jesus prayed a third time in the garden of Gethsemane, saying the exact same words again. It is not the repetition that is the issue. It's the vanity. God looks into our heart, not solely at our words.<br>  <br>  Luke 18:13 - the tax collector kept beating his breast and praying "God be merciful to me, a sinner." This repetitive prayer was pleasing to God because it was offered with a sincere and repentant heart.<br>  <br>  Acts 10:2,4 - Cornelius prayed constantly to the Lord and his prayers ascended as a memorial before God.<br>  <br>  Rom. 1:9 - Paul says that he always mentions the Romans in his prayers without ceasing.<br>  <br>  Rom. 12:12 - Paul commands us to be constant in prayer. God looks at what is in our heart, not necessarily how we choose our words.<br>  <br>  1 Thess. 5:17 - Paul commands us to pray constantly. Good repetition is different than vain repetition.<br>  <br>  Rev. 4:8 - the angels pray day and night without cessation the same words "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty." This is repetitious prayer that is pleasing to God.<br>  <br>  Psalm 136 - in this Psalm, the phrase "For His steadfast love endures forever" is more repetitious than any Catholic prayer, and it is God's divine Word.<br>  <br>  Dan. 3:35-66 - the phrase "Bless the Lord" is similarly offered repeatedly, and mirrors Catholic litanies.<br>  <br>  Again,  Catholics look at the ENTIRE bible and interpret things consistent with ALL verses..not just picking  out or singling out 1 or 2 verses.<br>  _______________________<br>  3) Catholics think of Baptism as a Sacrament.  Sacraments actually DO things.. they primarily impart Grace.  So Catholics fundamentally look at things different..and this was the prevailing view for nearly 1600 years 'til the Protestant reformation.   This site HERE, <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Infant_Baptism.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Infant_B...</a>  explains it better then I can. -- Please read it,  at least the first 3 ro 4 paragraphs if noting else.<br>  __________________<br>  4) Ironically there was more evidence for Purgatory in the book of Maccabee If I'm not mistaken,  Unfortunately,  the Protestants who broke away from the church in the 1600s, actually changed the basis of the OT from the Septuagint to the Tanakh and in the process,  felt they had the right to actually Throw OUT  7  books of the OT, which they called the "aprocrypha" -- So ironically, when Protestants say that Purgatory is "unbiblical" it is Partially because they made it so by throwing out the evidence.   <br>  <br>  However, here is a good link to discuss it. <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Purgatory.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Purgator...</a><br>  <br>  5) Pope is a servant.. Priests are servants.. They tend to Christ's church, to his flock, to the body of believers. He and the Cardinals have taken vows of pverty, everything they own is the property of the church. What they wear today is largely accumulated over the centuries.  His clothing is a reflection of a more ancient culture. Much like the statues and art work in the Catholic churches/cathedrals.  It is a form of devotional/religious art.  A cultural attitude towards putting your BEST efforts towards God,  showing God your best,  adorning your surroundings with art and images which glorify God.  <br>  Modern culture has lost sight of this and don't understand this. <br>  <br>  I agree with you though,  maybe it is a bit over done and maybe he should tone down his attire to be sensitive to the modern view of how he dresses.<br>  ______________________<br>  6) I am not an expert on Revelations, nor do I play one on TV.<br>  I'll defer to www.catholic.com on this one as they go over their response to a book published on just this topic in 1994. <br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Hunting_the_Whore_of_Babylon.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Hunting_...</a><br>  here's a snippet: "Hunt ignores the obvious symbolic meaning of the colors—purple for royalty and red for the blood of Christian martyrs. Instead, he is suddenly literal in his interpretation. "<br>  ...."Purple and red are not the dominant colors of Catholic clerical vestments. White is. All priests wear white (including bishops and cardinals when they are saying Mass)—even the pope does so..... "<br>  <br>  There is much more to that article.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	1.  Jesus wasn't talking about using a specific word.  You call the man who gave you 1/2 of his chromosomes "father," right?  Rabbi just means "teacher."  It isn't a sin to call educators teachers, right?<br>  <br>  2.  The prohibition is against "vain" repetitions.  Check on the definition of "vain."  When Catholics pray the rosary, for example, they are supposed to be meaning every word they say.  That would mean it's not "vain."  It's a kind of communication.<br>  <br>  2.a  Looked at it your way, that prohibition could also be used against anybody who ever says "amen, amen," or "praise the Lord, praise the Lord."  What's the definition of repetition, in that case?  Saying the same word more than twice in a minute?  More than twice in a half hour?  More than twice in a day?  More than 3 times in a minute?  See how that goes nowhere logically?<br>  <br>  3.  Nowhere in the Bible does it command total immersion for baptism.  It doesn't limit baptism to adults.  It doesn't command us to limite baptism to believers only.  For a Catholic, baptism is not about believing or not believing.  It is about being initiated into the Church and dedicating a new life to God.<br>  <br>  4.  There is  no direct reference to purgatory in scripture.  Catholics look to 2 sources of revelation to do God's will:  Holy Scripture and tradition.  They are both considered equal in revelatory power.  Purgatory falls under the tradition part of revelation.<br>  <br>  5.  A pope is a servant.  You seem to be assuming that a servant must be dressed poorly to serve.  The Pope sits in St. Peter's chair as a representative of St. Peter himself, whom Jesus made the first head of the Church.  The pope does not accept praise from men.  He accepts blessings, and gives them also, the way we are all called to do for each other.  The "fine clothing", chair, etc. are outward symbols of our respect for his office -- head of God's Church.  Again, "is that scriptural" doesn't apply.  Lots of things aren't scriptural:  the term "altar call," the word "rapture," reading the Bible in English, for example.<br>  <br>  6.  In revelation, the Whore of Babylon was the Roman Empire.  Romans were supposed to believe that their emperors were gods.  Purple and red were some of the emperial colors they used.  Not that a pope usually wears white and gold.|`|AA11440601	You ask too many questions for us to answer each one adequately. But I will write as far as I can.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Call no man your father.<br>  <br>  Matthew 23:6-9 reads, "They (the scribes and the Pharisees) love places of honor at banquets, seats of honor in synagogues, greetings in marketplaces, and the salutation 'Rabbi.' As for you, do not be called 'Rabbi.' You have but one teacher, and you are all brothers. Call no one on earth your father; you have but one Father in heaven."<br>  <br>  Are we also not to call anyone "teacher" or "doctor" which is how "rabbi' would translate?<br>  <br>  This is call for humility for those in leadership roles. Not to be taken literally.<br>  <br>  Some leaders in any church may fall into the same folly of a lack of humility as the pharisees of Jesus' day.<br>  <br>  The Apostle Paul calls himself a spiritual father in 1 Corinthians 4:15, 1 Thessalonians 2:11-12, and Philemon 10-11. And Peter calls himself the "father" of Mark in 1 Peter 5:13.<br>  <br>  <br>  2, Vain repetitions<br>  <br>  Catholicism includes a rich tradition of both informal (in our own words) and formal prayer just like our Jewish forefathers.<br>  <br>  The Church teaches, "The memorization of basic prayers offers an essential support to the life of prayer, but it is important to help learners savor their meaning." In other words, the Church emphasizes that formal prayer should not be mindless lip moving but instead a formal expression of clearly understood and heartfelt sentiments. <br>  <br>  The verse in question reads, in the King James Version, "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." <br>  <br>  Jesus is not talking of the repetitious prayer of the Jews in which Jesus would have participated in and whom He would not call heathen.<br>  <br>  The important Greek word here for "vain repetitions" is battalogeo, or babbling. The heathens had a magical perception of prayer and thought the more they babbled to their gods, the more that that god would respond. See 1 Kings 18:26.<br>  <br>  Then, two verses after the warning in Matthew against "vain repetitions," Jesus gave us the "Lord's" prayer, which most Protestant Christians pray with no qualms about praying "in vain." <br>  <br>  The same command in Luke 11:2 reads: "And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father..." -- "when you pray, say..."<br>  <br>  In addition, Christ prayed in repetitions:<br>  + Matthew 26:44: "And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words." <br>  + Mark 14:39 reads: "And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words." <br>  <br>  The angels pray repetitiously:<br>  + Revelation 4:8: "...and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." <br>  <br>  God commanded Moses to tell the Israelites: <br>  <br>  "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." (Deuteronomy 6:4-7)<br>  <br>  The Psalms are a collection of prayers and litanies, which were prayed formally in the Jewish synagogues and early Christian churches, are still prayed in synagogues and Catholic churches today -- and were even prayed by Christ from the Cross. <br>  <br>  The liturgy of the synagogue was (and is) filled with repetition and formalized prayer. Christ said "use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do.” Were the Jews heathens? Jesus also prayed in the synagogue in this way.<br>  <br>  Hymns are prayers. Is it "vain" to sing "Amazing Grace" more than once? <br>  <br>  Catholics do not babble but pray from the heart in formal and informal prayer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt4sect1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt4s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	In regards to Dan in Miami: there's nothing offensive about this post.

St. John addresses several passages in the First Letter of John to "fathers," and it is clear from the content that he is referring to spiritual fathers. St. Paul says that you can have ten thousand instructors, but "Have not many fathers," again, referring to spiritual fathers. He also calls himself a "spiritual father."<br>  <br>  2) The key word is not "repetitions," but rather, "vain." The Rosary is a series of meditations on events in the lives of Christ and Mary and the accompanying prayers. We don't just rattle off a bunch of prayers without considering how we can apply the lessons of the Bible stories to our own lives. As a result, the prayers are anything *but* vain.<br>  <br>  3) The Bible mentions entire households being baptized, and nowhere is it written that children and babies were excluded. Baptism is one's entrance into the Faith of Jesus Christ, and where better to begin than in the earliest weeks of a child's life? The parents and sponsors are committed to seeing that the child receives spiritual guidance in order to grow in Christ, and the child benefits spiritually from the cleansing of baptism.<br>  <br>  4) The Scriptural basis for Purgatory occurs in a book of the Bible that Protestants don't have. It's in Maccabees, and it refers to sending offerings to the Temple for the dead Israelites. It also mentions that it is a wholesome thing to pray for the dead. <br>  <br>  The reason Protestant Bibles don't contain the two books of Maccabbees and five more books is because Martin Luther realized that they were in conflict with some of his man-made doctrines. Rather than admit he was wrong, he chopped out the books that he didn't like.<br>  <br>  5) I sincerely hope that you aren't implying that the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon simply because our clergy are wearing certain colors. Purple and red are both liturgial colors, meaning that they are symbolic of sorrow and martyrdom and are used during certain times of the calendar.<br>  <br>  In John's day, the two colors had very different meanings. Purple was for royalty because of the expense of the dye (remember Lydia the seller of purple?) and red was popular among the corrupt and licentious. He was pointing toward the Roman government and state-approved religions of his time that were "drunk on the blood of the martyrs." That can only refer to the emperors and their persecutions of the Christians.<br>  <br>  If you're having a problem with your conscience, let me point out that "Sola Scriptura" is a false doctrine also created by the same person who gave you seven fewer books of the Bible -- good old Martin Luther, himself. This is the man who hated Jews, was demonically inspired to curse every time he even thought of the Catholic Church, and thought that his opinion was more important than God's. The result of his heresies was to split the Faith into two groups, which was NOT what Christ wanted for His Church.<br>  <br>  I hope that this answers your questions and any scruples you may have about joining the Church. I suggest that you sign up for RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) classes and learn more about Catholicism. You're under no obligation to join the Church if you do, and I think you will enjoy learning about the Faith.|`|AA10920670	In truth, your first question is a purposeful - and hateful - mistranslation. Done by Puritans. Specifically to hurt Catholics. The actual term is Babble. Do not Babble. Which many of our non-Catholic friends do. "And I just ask, And I just ask, and Lord if you please..." over and over again.<br>  <br>  Go to Biblegateway.com and look up the passage itself. Matthew 6:7. Then look at the same passage in various translations. You'll see that only the King James Version says this. The King James Version is an edited "version" of the original English Standard Bible commissioned by King James. Some 2 or 3 hundred years later, the Puritans edited it in an attempt to squelch Catholicism. <br>  <br>  It also originally contained all the same books as Catholic Bibles, including Maccabees. Maccabees is where Catholics get the idea of Purgatory from.<br>  <br>  The problem with taking ONE line and making it your "truth" is that it is taken out of context. Jesus himself uses the term "father" regularly throughout the Gospels. So is he contradicting himself when he says call no man Father?  Nope. He just uses the term to make a point. It also says call no man teacher and call no man leader. But non-Catholics are ok with the use of BOTH those terms. So why nit-pick the Catholics?<br>  <br>  As far as the baptism of infants, you have to understand Catholicism actually IS the faith launched by Jesus. Which means our origins are entirely Jewish. The Jewish people dedicate their infants to God. As Jesus himself was. That is in the Gospels. And all over the OT. Then at the "age of reason" a young adult may decide for him or herself. So Catholics have Baptism for infants then Confirmation for kids at the "age of reason."<br>  <br>  The pope may have a regal outward appearance. Due to his state as head of over 1 billion people. Catholics world wide. But in truth the man owns nothing. He sleeps in a small bed in the "papal apartments" - which is actually a meeting room with a huge library. He owns nothing himself. The pope does not accept the praise of men in the context you seem to think. The current pope is actually a very shy man who would rather retire and write. The former pope actually hated having his ring kissed and regularly tried to avoid it. <br>  <br>  You might pick up a copy of Catholicism for Dummies at the library. It will answer all your questions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.2catholicpriests.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.2catholicpriests.com/</a>|`|AcLjARwyaa	If you want to be open minded, you starting point must be as follows,  the catholic church is not biblical, the bible is catholic.  So, bearing that in mind your questions are nonsensical.  If you can grasp that then you are almost home.  It is an important concept and goes against everything you think you know.  go to you local pasrish and sign up for RCIA, for as our lord said, when asked where he lived and as we wrote down since we did write the new testament, "come and see."<br>  <br>  Jesus did not come to write, He came to found his church -- the catholic church.<br>  <br>  BTW as a hint that we know much more than you, Jesus said not to call anyone on earth divine, ie you heavenly father, he did not say dont call your daddy father.

You have a principle of interpretation, so why not the Catholics. Jesus is saying that only God has the ultimate say-so on anything. <br>  <br>  2) Saying the Our Father can be vain repetition too. To deny that is to be magical and superstitious. The differentiator is the person not the prayer. <br>  <br>  3) A convert should answer the question on Infant Baptism, one who knew the Bible better than any of the last 150 years, John Henry Newman :<br>  Sermon 16. Infant Baptism<br>  <a href="http://www.newmanreader.org/works/parochial/volume7/sermon16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmanreader.org/works/paroch...</a><br>  "Now, for fifteen hundred years there was no dispute or difficulty in answering this question all over the Christian world; none who acknowledged the duty of baptizing at all, but administered the rite to infants, as we do at present. But about three hundred years ago strange opinions were set afloat, and sects arose, doing every thing which had not been done before, and undoing every thing which had been done before, and all this (as they professed) on the principle that it was every one's duty to judge and act for himself; and among these new sects there was one which maintained that Infant Baptism was a mistake, and that, mainly upon this short argument,—that it was nowhere commanded in Scripture....[ Read on online ]"<br>  <br>  4) The basis, or better 'one basis' is in the Catholic Bible which preserves the book of Maccabbees, which your Pope, Pope Luther took out : <br>  (2 Maccabees 39-46):<br>  <br>  "39 On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his men went to gather up the bodies of the slain and bury them with their kinsmen in their ancestral tombs. <br>  <br>  40 But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had been slain. <br>  <br>  41 They all therefore praised the ways of the Lord, the just judge who brings to light the things that are hidden. <br>  <br>  42 Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be fully blotted out. The noble Judas warned the soldiers to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen. <br>  <br>  43 He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, inasmuch as he had the resurrection of the dead in view; <br>  <br>  44 for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been useless and foolish to pray for them in death. <br>  <br>  45 But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. <br>  <br>  46 Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be freed from this sin. "<br>  <br>  <br>  5) Pope Paul VI used to say that every night he went to bed with a Crown of Thorns, hate mail spread around him from the day's mail. Take what you think of him and multiply it by millions. Then there are the assassins who are always present. (Pope Paul VI was knifed in the Phillipines ). IT is clean clothing, and know more fine than the High Priest of the OT for sure...He accepts only fitting praise and refers all good to God...and that is a teaching throne. <br>  <br>  6) John Henry Newman, after he became a Catholic, said that he always regretted bitterly entertaining the thought that you express here . Read him to get the sense.|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	1. The Elders of the Church are Called "Fathers" and the Faithful "Children"<br>  Matt. 23:9 - Jesus says, "call no man father." But Protestants use this verse in an attempt to prove that it is wrong for Catholics to call priests "father." This is an example of "eisegesis" (imposing one's views upon a passage) as opposed to "exegesis" (drawing out the meaning of the passage from its context). In this verse, Jesus was discouraging His followers from elevating the scribes and Pharisees to the titles of “fathers” and “rabbis” because they were hypocrites. Jesus warns us not to elevate anyone to the level of our heavenly Father.<br>  Jesus also says not to call anyone teacher or rabbi as well. But don’t Protestants call their teachers “teacher?” What about this commandment of Jesus? When Protestants say “call no man father,” they must also argue that we cannot call any man teacher either. <br>  Priesthood and fatherhood have always been identified together. Fatherhood literally means "communicating one's nature," and just as biological fathers communicate their nature to their children, so do spiritual fathers communicate the nature of God to us, their children, through teaching and example. <br>  <br>  2. Jesus' focus in this instruction is on the "vain," and not on the "repetition."<br>  Jesus prayed a third time in the garden of Gethsemane, saying the exact same words again. It is not the repetition that is the issue. It's the vanity. God looks into our heart, not solely at our words. <br>  <br>  3. Jesus clearly says the kingdom of heaven also belongs to children. There is no age limit on entering the kingdom, and no age limit for being eligible for baptism.<br>  It was only the adults who were candidates for baptism that had to profess a belief in Jesus. This is consistent with the Church's practice of instructing catechumens before baptism. But this verse does not support a "believer's baptism" requirement for everyone. See Acts 16:15,33. The earlier one comes to baptism, the better. For those who come to baptism as adults, the Church has always required them to profess their belief in Christ. For babies who come to baptism, the Church has always required the parents to profess the belief in Christ on behalf of the baby. But there is nothing in the Scriptures about a requirement for ALL baptism candidates to profess their own belief in Christ (because the Church has baptized babies for 2,000 years). <br>  <br>  4.  The one I clearly see is Revelation 21:27 tells us that "...nothing unclean will enter Heaven." <br>  Daniel 12:2, Matthew 12:32, 1 Corinthians 3:13-15, 2 Timothy 1:16-18, Hebrews 12:14, Hebrews 12:22-23, 1 Peter 4:6 and Revelation 21:10, 27 all speak of Purgatory in their telling of the need for purification, prayers for the dead, Christ's preaching to the dead, or how nothing unclean will see God. <br>  <br>  5.Matthew 16:18-19 <br>  The Pope, as Bishop of Rome, is simply the successor of Peter, who was the first Bishop of Rome and head of the earthly Church. <br>  <br>  For more questions on the Catholic faith and it's teachings, I would recommend going to the Church and enrolling in  the RCIA class, google Catholic Encyclopedia or go to fisheaters.com.<br>  This is why the Church is a visible church. Nothing is hidden , nor are there secrets. Posting a question here on Answers you will get anti-Catholic answers, just as some faiths are taught in their churches by their preachers or there are those Jack Chick tracts that are not just ignorant, but just a bunch of Catholic bashing. And may I add that Christ founded a church, not a Bible. Not everything taught is written.

I always talk to God like a friend....I tell Him everything I'm confused about and everything I'm upset about and everything I'm thankful for...etc. And I started telling Him how much I hated being that way, how much I was hurting people's feelings and that I wanted to stop. I never asked the He fix me, I asked for the ability to become aware of that anger before I lash out, and for the strength to let it go before it could grip me. I still stumble now and then, but whenever I feel that anger coming on, I close my eyes, I take a deep breath and I pray simply "Please give me the strength" and after a few short months, I almost have the patience of Mother Teressa. .|`|uOwgkwTLaa	If you want true belief and the feeling of Peace and Love, feel free to try what I did.

The Bible writers made it into a clear pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence outside of the Bible that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitler’s holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) When Jesus comes back he will personally slaughter ALL the CHILDREN of the wrong Church brand! He will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed believing that Jesus doesn’t do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam matches Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new religious “sins” like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the new President Obama honors most Christian and Catholic clergy dogmas damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) “I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD”* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they can’t beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children on his own to announce his expected return and at the same time to teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political “PRO-LIFE” stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus’ REVELATION…!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk!) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>  <br>  I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise when they find out that their children have been mysteriously slaughtered! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies! <br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to “dash the infants against the rocks” after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all! <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story… most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.<br>  <br>  I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT that is strongly believed in Christianity today!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. “Turning the other cheek” is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6)… The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in God’s Law “Be fruitful and multiply,” but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus’ gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the “Kingdom Sake.” See Wikipedia “castration”. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS! Please give me a break!
EDB3Q0Yyaa	Read "Hinduism does not permit the caste system" by Arora.  Many people have wrongly come to the conclusion that caste system is an essential part of Hinduism when in fact caste system is a complete and utter abuse and corruption of Hinduism and has no sanction in the Hindu scriptures.  Moreover, the problem of the caste system isn't so much Religion but the illiteracy and poverty in india which gives birth to plagues like the caste system.  Another thing is to actually EDUCATE Indians about true Hinduism because often many of the Hindus who follow the caste system have never even read the Gita, Vedas, Upanishads or any of the other books in Hinduism.|`|dFBccLExaa	People that don't like it tend to become Buddhist, since they are very similar in nature.

As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah. Thus the four divisions of society--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--are to be ascertained according to qualities and activities. If one was born in a brahmana family and has acquired the brahminical qualifications, he is to be accepted as a brahmana; otherwise, he should be considered a brahma-bandhu. Similarly, if a sudra acquires the qualities of a brahmana, although he was born in a sudra family, he is not a sudra; because he has developed the qualities of a brahmana, he should be accepted as a brahmana. The Krsna consciousness movement is meant to develop these brahminical qualities. Regardless of the community in which one was born, if one develops the qualities of a brahmana he should be accepted as a brahmana, and he then may be offered the order of sannyasa. Unless one is qualified in terms of the brahminical symptoms, one cannot take sannyasa. In designating a person a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, birth is not the essential symptom. This understanding is very important. Herein Narada Muni distinctly says that one may be accepted according to the caste of his birth if he has the corresponding qualifications, but otherwise he should not. One who has attained the qualifications of a brahmana, regardless of where he was born, should be accepted as a brahmana. Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a sudra or a candala, regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those symptoms.<br>  <br>  Bhagavad Gita As It Is   Chapter 18     TEXT 41<br>                      <br>                      brahmana-ksatriya-visam<br>                        sudranam ca parantapa<br>                        karmani pravibhaktani<br>                      svabhava-prabhavair gunaih<br>  <br>                              SYNONYMS<br>     brahmana--the brahmanas; ksatriya--the ksatriyas; visam--the vaisyas; sudranam--the sudras; ca--and; parantapa--O subduer of the enemies; karmani--activities; pravibhaktani--are divided; svabhava--own nature; prabhavaih--born of; gunaih--by the modes of material nature.<br>                             TRANSLATION<br>     Brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras are distinguished by their qualities of work, O chastiser of the enemy, in accordance with the modes of nature.<br>  <br>                               TEXT 42<br>                       samo damas tapah saucam<br>                        ksantir arjavam eva ca<br>                       jnanam vijnanam astikyam<br>                      brahma-karma svabhava-jam<br>  <br>                               SYNONYMS<br>     samah--peacefulness; damah--self-control; tapah--austerity; saucam--purity; ksantih--tolerance; arjavam--honesty; eva--certainly; ca--and; jnanam--knowledge; vijnanam--wisdom; astikyam--religiousness; brahma--of a brahmana; karma--duty; svabhava-jam--born of his own nature.<br>  <br>                             TRANSLATION<br>     Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness--these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work.<br>  <br>                               TEXT 43<br>                     sauryam tejo dhrtir daksyam<br>                        yuddhe capy apalayanam<br>                        danam isvara-bhavas ca<br>                      ksatram karma svabhava-jam<br>  <br>                               SYNONYMS<br>     sauryam--heroism; tejah--power; dhrtih--determination; daksyam--resourcefulness; yuddhe--in battle; ca--and; api--also; apalayanam--not fleeing; danam--generosity; isvara--leadership; bhavah--nature; ca--and; ksatram--ksatriya; karma--duty; svabhava-jam--born of his own nature.<br>  <br>                             TRANSLATION<br>     Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity, and leadership are the qualities of work for the ksatriyas.<br>  <br>                               TEXT 44<br>                       krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam<br>                      vaisya-karma svabhava-jam<br>                        paricaryatmakam karma<br>                       sudrasyapi svabhava-jam<br>  <br>                               SYNONYMS<br>     krsi--plowing; go--cows; raksya--protection; vanijyam--trade; vaisya--vaisya; karma--duty; svabhava-jam--born of his own nature; paricarya--service; atmakam--nature; karma--duty; sudrasya--of the sudra; api--also; svabhava-jam--born of his own nature.<br>  <br>                             TRANSLATION<br>     Farming, cow protection and business are the qualities of work for the vaisyas, and for the sudras there is labor and service to others.|`|zcwSIBHwaa	The only way is becoming Buddhist or Jain.

v4YCheYoaa	I think that I might have interesting answer to your question. There is a program called TypeIt ReadIt that can talk in different languages. I was using it the other day for Spanish. <br>  <br>  Here is how it works: Type or cut/paste what you want the computer to say and click its speech button. The computer will start talking. This is great for learning pronunciation and words. It also comes with a spell checker that supports French. (The spell checker is not the greatest in the world but it seems to get the job done.) The program is freeware and can be downloaded from Schoolfreeware's website. <a href="http://www.schoolfreeware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.schoolfreeware.com</a> <br>  <br>  Unfortunately it doesn't come with French voices but you can get a French voice for about $30.00 from Cepstral (there is a link in the program's website someplace). The program doesn't translate any words, but it will speak to you, in that language, and you can use it to type in French. (You may need a character pallet or change the keyboard setting to type in French.) This program can save to a file so you can listen to your French files on your iPod. <br>  <br>  If you are looking for a program to translate English to French try Yahoo! Babble Fish <a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com">http://babelfish.yahoo.com</a>|`|LcOPL8gCaa	I would go to a book store or even look more online and ask about it.

qTRzRi8gaa	It's like the classic bell curve.  Most people are somewhere in the middle, and the further you get from the middle the less chances you have.  I'd say the exceptionally brilliant and the exceptionally stupid would both have the hardest time at it, since most people are just 'average'.<br>  <br>  I don't claim to be utterly brilliant or anything, but the hardest part for me is elitism.  There are lots of people I wouldn't mind to f*ck, but I've never met anyone I'd care to date.  I'm just too damn complicated to be able to have an interest in most people (and not just complicated in the good way, either...)  <br>  <br>  Love implies a sort of selflessness.  It's hard to be selflessly 'in love' when one's thoughts and hobbies are just so much more fulfilling than anything else on the perceptible horizon...<br>  <br>  edit:  The only reasonable advice I can give, is scout places related to your interests.  Bookstores, museums, or someplace in your field of work, whatever, places where brainy types are likely to go in their free time.  Other than that, I have no clue...

I also thought everything to death, so I had a difficult time acting naturally in social situations. I know this sounds awful, but many ppl are smart but are not analytical, and I found it boring to just look at the surface and easily get bored with ppl. I'm sure I drive plenty of ppl nuts too. I joined groups to meet ppl who had my interests and when I couldn't find a group, I started it. I wanted to rock climb and started an outdoor group for women in my area and met lots of great women that way..but it's been a challenge to find someone who is sharp and likes some of the things I do..I don't think I'm brilliant, but am easily bored..it takes patience to find the right one..Good luck!

There are no spiritual reasons not to have children.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with having more than one or two kids.

4GiIXWUXaa	The Resurrection of Christ, which took place on the first day of the week. <br>  (Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-20; Luke 24:1-53; John 20:1-31).<br>  <br>  Obviously the Sabbath didn't change "overnight" but in the later years.<br>  <br>  The Reason being, is that at first nearly all of the converts to "Christianity" were Jews. (All of the Disciples were Jewish; Even Paul the Apostle was a Jew). It was a Jewish Sect. In the years that followed the ascension and the preaching of the gospel by the Disciples, many Jews were converted but many Gentiles also. It was decided that the Gentile Converts did not have to adhere to the Ceremonial and Dietary Laws of Judaism; so they were not under obligation to follow the Religious Practices of the Observance of Jewish Feast Days, be circumcised, restrict diet insofar as clean and unclean animals and so forth; even though they were converting to Judaism.<br>  <br>  After a few decades, the Gentile converts increased in number, but the Jewish converts did not. Eventually, the Jewish Sect, now labeled as "Christianity" (from christos, the Gk. word for Messiah; meaning "Anointed One") was for the most part Hellenized as it spread across the Roman Empire. Eventually, the amount of Gentile converts increased far greater than the Jewish converts, and somewhere in the time frame of the 100 years after the Resurrection until the adoption of Christianity as the state religion of Rome in the 3rd Century AD, the date of the Sabbath was officially changed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out. xoxo ?<br>  <br>  *edit* Most people forget that; All early Gentile converts to "Christianity" were converts to Judaism, technically.  Jesus Was a Jew and observed Feast Days and Ceremonial Laws. Anyways, this is History; well documented.<br>  <br>  *edit* Main: no no, Sunday is the first day of the week. Saturday is the 7th, and technically the Sabbath. But Christians observe Sunday, the 1st day as the Sabbath in remembrance of the Resurrection, weekly.  <br>  Though the Annual celebration of the Resurrection (Easter) coincides with Passover. Early converts celebrated Passover AND the Resurrection because they were Jewish.  There were Pagan festivals that coincided with the Jewish observance of Passover; and when the Church was seeking to continue making converts out of the local pagans, they scheduled the "Easter" celebration to coincide with the Pagan Festivals as to ease the new converts into the religion; as most of the new Church were now Gentiles and did not observe Passover. The Church simply changed the main theme of the celebration to a more "Christian" one. <br>  Anyways, Saturday is the technical Sabbath. But Christians celebrate the Sabbath on Sunday.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Jesus was resurrected on the first day of the week. We mark this as the Lords day.....It is not the sabbath.|`|AA11403032	Because he rested on the 7th day, and everyone knows the week starts on Monday, so Sunday is the 7th day.<br>  <br>  Unless of course you reckon that the week starts on Sunday, in which case the Jews have it right and the 7th day is Saturday.<br>  <br>  Of course you could also be a Seventh day adventist who still follow the original Judeo-Christian week and therefore also treat Saturday as the sabbath.<br>  <br>  <br>  I've decided that the week starts on a thursday, so I'm having a rest today.|`|hj76FSKdaa	That’s a loaded question.  As you know, the New Testament shows us that the early church met on ANY day, although Sunday was a frequent choice.  So the answer to your question is that Sunday is not the official Sabbath of the Lord – because there is no longer a requirement that we limit our corporate worship to any particular day of the week.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Seventh Day Adventist claim that most Old Testament Sabbath regulations are “ceremonial,” so we modern Christians do not need (for example) to refrain from making a fire on the Sabbath.   Incidentally, the Jewish Sabbath was commanded by God to be a time of rest, where people stayed at home (not for corporate worship).  The Bible does not make a distinction between “ceremonial” Sabbath rules and non-ceremonial regulations; that distinction comes from Ellen White only.  All commands to keep the Sabbath are Old Testament ones to the sons of Israel.   According to Colossians no one calling himself a Christian should judge another respecting the Sabbath, and yet the SDA church believes that Christians receive the "mark of the beast" for not keeping the Saturday Sabbath. They make salvation dependent on which day of the week one keeps.  Wouldn’t you think that the New Testament authors would have made the point about the Sabbath clear, if Sunday keeping would doom us to Hell?|`|JP1o1ggZaa	The "Lord's Day" is one of the traditional Christian names for Sunday, the first day of the Judaeo-Christian seven-day week, observed by most Christians as the memorial of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is said in the four canonical gospels of the New Testament to have taken place early on the first day of the week. Very early in the history of Christianity, the tradition of Christ's Sunday morning resurrection gave rise to the Christian custom, later to become an obligation, of gathering every Sunday morning to worship the Christian Lord, Jesus — hence the name "Lord's Day".|`|FP3vBHUjaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/sunday-fraud.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/...</a>|`|JQLpNJzuaa	Uh...<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church???<br>  <br>  The Juden celebrate Saturn-day.

Gnosticism. A religious tradition that flourished from about 200BC to 500AD in Egypt, spreading out into Rome and Jerusalem, consisting of aspects of Egyptian Paganism, Judaism and Christianity. <br>  2. Gnosticism. A philisophical strain found within many modern religions, where today you'll have Gnostic Christians, Gnostic Pagans and even Gnostic Buddhists. <br>  <br>  The general theory of Gnosticism is, to put it simply and to miss many aspects of it's essence, that we can Know (Gnosis) God (or Gods) by meditating. In this way it's similar to Zen in Buddhism. (to me)|`|mSFjbetxaa	Gnosticism is a philosophical and religious movement which started in pre-Christian times. Gnosticism involves the relational or experiential knowledge of God and of the divine or spiritual nature within us.<br>  <br>  It became one of the three main belief systems within 1st century Christianity, and was noted for four factors by which differed from the two other branches of Christianity:  Novel beliefs about Gods, the Bible and the world which differed from those of other Christian groups. <br>  <br>   Tolerance of different religious beliefs within and outside of Gnosticism. <br>  <br>   Lack of discrimination against women. Although Jesus treated women as equals, and Paul mostly did the same, the other Christian belief systems started to oppress women in later generations.  <br>  <br>   A belief that salvation is achieved through relational and experiential knowledge. In the words of The contemporary Gnostic Apostolic Church, humanity needs to be awakened and brought "to a realisation of his true nature. Mankind is moving towards the Omega Point, the Great day when all must graduate or fall. This day is also the Day of Judgment in that only those who have entered the Path of Transfiguration and are being reborn can return to the Treasury of Light."<br>  <br>  The movement and its literature were essentially wiped out before the end of the 5th century CE by  Catholic heresy hunters and the Roman Army. Its beliefs are currently experiencing a rebirth throughout the world, triggered in part by the discovery of an ancient Gnostic library at Nag Hammadi, Egypt in the 1940s, and the finding of the Gospel of Judas at El Minya, Egypt, in the 1970s.<br>  <br>  The Gospel of Mary Magdalen is my favorite of the Gnostic Gospels.  It speaks of a Jesus who taught about enlightenment and not asinine religious nonsense.

The Book of Mormon gives a better understanding of the Bible (a book that many believe they already have a perfect understanding of so there is no need for any other scripture). <br>  <br>  Even after Jesus was crucified, his diciples still wrote their words in scripture and it wasn't compiled together into what we would recognize as a bible until centuries later.  There is some truth taught in all religions.  <br>  <br>  The seekers of truth will gain more enlightenment when they sincerely ask God in prayer.  He will guide them.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Congratulations on posing a missionary style question.<br>  For the sake of discussion, if we actually knew that the Book of Mormon was from God, wouldn't that be the most important thing for us to read and learn from since the development of the Bible?

A man who prayed on his knees for such a long time to know if God existed. Frankly the stuff was exciting. But don't feel bad, even Mark Twain couldn't handle it he fell asleep two times he tried to read it. <br>  <br>  To those who say their is no evidence. There is plenty. Many have posted the evidence in the past on questions that have asked for proof, but this isn't a question on evidence found in the Book of Mormon but on whether or not if you'd be willing to try to read it. But you're such a close minded bunch you reject the evidences we have posted in the past. Surprise, surprise. True faith doesn't come from evidence or miracles. First comes faith then come miracles. <br>  <br>   And what's this John Smith bit going around. That's the man that Pocahontas saved. We're talking about Joseph Smith, a prophet of the Lord.

How do you know that's not scripture also? Or even the Satanic bible? Have you read them and prayed about them?<br>  <br>  You believe, because you asked God and have a feeling from a prayer. So, you have a feeling, which gives you faith that the Book of Mormon is fact. This is backward. We need to look at the facts, get faith from the facts and the feelings will follow. (Acts 17:11, Hebrews 11:1)<br>  <br>  You need to test the spirit that gave you the answer to your prayer like 1 John 4:1 says. Otherwise, you can very well be deceived like the people in 2 Corinthians 11. See? People can be deceived. They have been deceived before. Make very certain that you are not deceived. Please look at the facts. <br>  <br>  By the way, Ezekiel 36 and 37 is talking about Israel and Judah. They were two, but they will become one. That happened as prophesied. That is the two sticks. I encourage you to read both chapters and see for yourself. <br>  <br>  I have read enough to see discrepancies between the Book of Mormon and the Bible. Just a few examples of many:<br>  <br>  Alma 7:10 says Jesus is born in Jerusalem. That's incorrect. Jesus was born in Bethlehem. I know - they are close. 2+2 = 5 is close too.<br>  <br>  Alma 11:43 says the resurrected body will be restored exactly like it is now. 1 Cor 15:44 says the resurrected body will be a spirit. Jesus says spirits don't have flesh and bones (Luke 24:39).<br>  <br>  2 Nephi 25:23 says that we are saved by grace AFTER ALL WE CAN DO. Honestly - I have not done all I can do. I'm doomed by the gospel of LDS. Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5, John 3:16, John 6:28-29, Romans 3:20, Romans 5:15-18, Romans 10:9, all of Galatians and many, many more verses state that salvation is by faith through grace. Not one bit by the law, good deeds, works. Please don't ignore those. Works come because the faith that saves us is alive and compels us to do works (James 2:17).<br>  This verse drives home how wrong 2 Nephi 25:23 is:<br>  James 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit does NOT contradict himself. One of these books is not from the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  There is absolutely no concrete evidence outside of the Book of Mormon that the people existed or the events took place. People groups the size of Rome will leave evidence. The Book of Mormon talks about weapons of steel. We don't find those. We find weapons of stone, flint arrows and stuff like that. The Book of Mormon talks about crops like wheat and barley. We don't find those. We find crops like corn and squash. The book of Mormon talks about animals like monkeys, horses, elephants. We don't find animal remains like that in Central America during that time period. The Book of Mormon talks about chariots. We don't see chariot parts anywhere in America. <br>  <br>  So, I've read parts of the Book of Mormon. My testimony from the Holy Spirit states that it is false. The facts back it up. <br>  <br>  My testimony from the Holy Spirit states the Bible is true. I have a very strong faith that the Bible is true. The facts back that up also.<br>  <br>  So, why don't I read the whole thing over and over and meditate on it? The same reason I don't read the Satanic bible. It's not from God. I want to meditate on the truth. I want to transform my mind by filling it with scripture.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  WellTravelledProg - interesting link. This quote is interesting to me:<br>  <br>  The original text of II Nephi 16:2 reads:<br>  <br>      "Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly."<br>  <br>  This is a quotation from the King James Version of the Bible, specifically Isaiah 6:2. In a rare grammatical mistake, the KJV has an incorrect plural for 'seraph'. The correct plural should be "seraphim", as the later text of II Nephi 16:2 reads. How does one explain that Joseph would make the exact spelling error in the Book of Mormon "translation" that the writers of the KJV of the Bible made centuries before?|`|eshummTJaa	The book of mormon is NOT scripture...<br>  <br>  there IS NO EVIDENCE in the Americas of any of the claims...there is no historical/oral history from the many native American Indian tribes that were living here at that time who would have noticed all of that occurring...<br>  <br>  and taking so called gold plates from their lands would have gotten that crazy white man in a whole lot of trouble..<br>  <br>  We have the Inspired word of God in the Holy Bible..from Genesis to Revelations....there is no need for a counterfeit upgrade from satan....<br>  <br>  on the last day...the day of judgment...begone from me ye workers of iniquity for I know you not...<br>  <br>  is following a lie worth losing salvation?|`|cGULgr1caa	all i have to say on the subject is this<br>  <br>   Revelation 22:18-19  Do not add to or take away from that which God has written.<br>     <br>     Galatians 1:6-8  There is only ONE true gospel.

Rather than generally thank her for 'all she's done', perhaps mention a particular incident. Did she have encouraging words when you felt you'd done badly? Did she believe in you when no one else did? Did she have a good sense of humour when things were difficult? Did she put in extra time when training you? I mean outside work hours? etc. It's the specifics which can help get your message of thanks across. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll find the right words.|`|QAdv9xF2aa	Say something like, I know I may not have always shown my appreciation, but I do really appreciate you training me.  It will help me in my future...|`|xMScLoxtaa	Be like "I love what you have done for me, you are so under appreciated, I appreciate it!"|`|5107c3cf09f31a605b6d95cbf016f1dbaa	Tough titty|`|U6VYqhezaa	The fact that you are even thinking of writing a note to your boss shows that you are conscientious and kind employee. Because you are shy a card is the perfect way to express your feelings without feeling nervous or worried. Perhaps you can include how grateful you are for all of her training and the experience you gained from your job. You could also add something about the positive work environment she created and how much you enjoyed coming to work each day. In the ending you can reiterate your gratitude and extend wishes of a pleasant future. Don't stress too much as I'm sure anything you write will be wonderful!
TeU3cWsHaa	Yeah it is scary the way the world is going.  I'm from New Zealand, which used to be such a safe place, forget that now.  Things have gotten worse generally.  And the media totally encourages people more and more to look after number 1, and that the measure of success comes down to how beautiful you are and how much money you have - otherwise you are 'unfortunate'.  This makes us compare ourselves 'upwards' on what we don't have instead of 'downwards' on what we do have.<br>  I feel sorry for kids being born nowadays in terms of how they have missed out on the pure lovely simplicity of the world in its more purest form days.<br>  sorry for taking up so much space, but this is a true poem that i've heard several times.  (= (i'm not a geek but bored at work)<br>  <br>  The Paradox of our Time by George Carlin<br>  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less; we buy more but enjoy less We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time; we have more knowledge, but less judgment; more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.<br>  <br>  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life, we've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.<br>  <br>  We conquered outer space but not inner space.<br>  We've done larger things, but not better things.<br>  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.<br>  We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.<br>  We write more, but learn less.<br>  We plan more, but accomplish less.<br>  We've learned to rush, but not to wait.<br>  We build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.<br>  <br>  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; big men and small character; steep profits and shallow relationships.<br>  <br>  These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throw-away morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the stock room.<br>  <br>  Only thing one can do is strive to be the best they can to others around them, friends as well as strangers, and share those values with their kids etc.  Many hands make light work and all that.  <br>  ok i'm going now (=|`|8gveZWbHaa	How short people's memories are!<br>  <br>  Look in the history books, love, the 2 Great Wars were worse than this, and that's just a start.<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't believe everything you read in the papers.

At least in my case.|`|k03dYskYaa	We are living in the "last days" according to the Bible. <br>  (Read Matthew 24 and 2 Timothy 3:1-5) It covers what you are talking about.<br>  <br>  I also wanted to share with you excerpts from this article:<br>  Big Business Helps to Identify “the Last Days”<br>  <br>    By molding personalities, big business is helping to provide the evidence of “the last days” as found at 2?Timothy 3:1-4: But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with [including the difficulty of coping with economic anxieties] will be here. For men will be?.?.?.<br>    Lovers of themselves: Materialists are self-centered, an attitude encouraged by commercial advertising, which argues: ‘You deserve the best. Be good to yourself. Look out for number one’<br>    Lovers of money: American humorist Mark Twain once said: “Some men worship rank, some worship heroes, some worship power, some worship God, .?.?. but they all worship money”<br>    Self-assuming, haughty: A German politician said of foot-dragging chemical firms asked to stop polluting: “I find the predominating attitude quite bad. It is the arrogance?of power”<br>    Unthankful, disloyal: English writer Thomas Fuller said, “Riches rather enlarge than satisfy appetites” and, “The usual trade and commerce is cheating all round by consent”<br>    Having no natural affection: Firms that for reasons of profit sell developing nations products outlawed elsewhere or that locate hazardous factories in lands with less stringent safety regulations show little concern for the lives of others<br>    Not open to any agreement, slanderers: Economist Adam Smith said that “commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity”<br>    Without self-control, fierce: Excessive installment buying, credit-card spending sprees, and the “buy now, pay later” mentality, fostered by commerce for personal gain, betray a lack of self-control; some commercial pursuits pander to human weaknesses and make fortunes from drugs, vice, and gambling<br>    Without love of goodness, betrayers: The newspaper The German Tribune says: “Where the colossal cost of coping with environmental pollution is concerned, moral standards can leave much to be desired.” People with no moral standards find it easy to betray others for the sake of personal gain<br>    Headstrong: Powerful groups, such as gun and tobacco lobbies, stubbornly spend fortunes trying to dictate political policies to ensure high sales, even though their wares endanger health and public safety<br>    Puffed up with pride: Possessions are no reason for pride, despite the claims of materialists. Greek fabulist Aesop said: “Outside show is a poor substitute for inner worth”<br>    Lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God: Commercial entertainment stresses pleasures to the exclusion of spirituality and has created a generation of hedonistic pleasure addicts<br>  <br>  <br>  Surely, all the evidence in fulfillment of Bible prophecy shows that this world is moving relentlessly toward its end. And when that comes, it will mean a period of unparalleled trouble for mankind. Jesus called it “great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.” (Matt. 24:21) During that period all this world’s political, economic and false religious systems will be demolished. Thus, all the time, effort and expense that went into sustaining those systems will have come to nothing. Surely Christians will not want to direct their main efforts toward those things that will not last. Their main loyalty and sacrifices should be directed to that which is eternal. “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—1?John 2:17.|`|AA10674998	Great want is coming.<br>  Between June 6 and June 8 is a great flood of tears and death.

Think of all the kids with leukemia, or people born with crippling diseases or without the mental capability to even feed themselves. All these things should convince thinking minds that something is radically wrong. Did God blow it when He created humanity? What sort of tyrant must our Creator be if this was His master plan?<br>  Sadly, many use the issue of suffering as an excuse to reject any thought of God, when its existence is the very reason we should accept Him. Suffering stands as terrible testimony to the truth of the explanation given by the Word of God.<br>  But how can we know that the Bible is true? Simply by studying the prophecies of Matthew 24, Luke 21, and 2 Timothy 3. A few minutes of openhearted inspection will convince any honest skeptic that this is no ordinary book. It is the supernatural testament of our Creator as to why there is suffering . . . and what we can do about it.<br>  The Bible tells us that God cursed the earth because of Adam's transgression. Weeds are a curse. So is disease. Sin and suffering cannot be separated. The Scriptures inform us that we live in a fallen creation. In the beginning, God created man perfect and he lived in a perfect world, without suffering. It was Heaven on earth. When sin came into the world, death and misery came with it.<br>  Those who understand the message of Holy Scripture eagerly await a new Heaven and a new earth "wherein dwells righteousness." In that coming Kingdom there will be no more pain, suffering, disease or death. We are told that no eye has ever seen, nor has any ear heard, neither has any man's mind ever imagined the wonderful things that God has in store for those that love Him. Think for a moment of what it would be like if food grew with the fervor of weeds. Think how wonderful it would be if the deserts became incredibly fertile, if creation stopped devouring humanity. Imagine if the weather worked for us instead of against us, if disease completely disappeared, if pain was a thing of the past . . . if death was no more.<br>  There is a wise saying: "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is." That is solid advice for when you are dealing with sinful mankind. But the promise of a new Heaven and a new earth come from a faithful Creator, and there is no greater insult to God than not to believe His promises. When a nation repents and finds peace with God through trusting in the Savior, God promises to forgive their sins and heal their land.<br>  The dilemma is that we are like a small child whose insatiable appetite for chocolate has caused his face to break out. He looks in the mirror and sees a sight that makes him depressed. His face is nothing but ugly sores. But instead of stopping eating his beloved chocolate, he takes solace by stuffing more into his mouth. Yet, his very joy is actually the cause of his suffering.<br>  The whole face of the earth is nothing but ugly sores of suffering. Everywhere we look, we see unspeakable pain. But instead of believing God's explanation and asking Him to forgive us and change our appetite, we run deeper into sin's sweet embrace. There we find solace in its temporal pleasures; thus intensifying our pain, both in this life, and in the life to come.<br>  <br>  P.S. I didn't "just get over it"  He carried me through it.|`|RZetcwalaa	You hit the nail on the head every time, simply put anyone who looks at the suffering in the world and holds the belief that an infinitely loving and merciful god is in charge is an imbecile, or was raised by an imbecile.<br>  <br>  A child would ask these questions<br>  <br>  A) Why does a god who knows everything need to test your faith with horrific situations?<br>  <br>  B) Why does god test our faith if he made us?<br>  <br>  C) What is the point in heaven and hell if god loves everyone equally?<br>  <br>  Simple questions require simple answers, anyone going out of their way and invoking answers from middle eastern goat herders obsessed with the idea that they had the best god has another agenda.|`|mggFgqFPaa	He won't have to, that's why it's called "heaven."<br>  <br>  But I found this little story of yours quite interesting in the midst of your bashing God;<br>  <br>  "Or will they go straight to Hell because they still 'made a choice to be gay' even after being permanently scarred as children." <br>  <br>  So you're saying that "gays" are not born as "gays" but are brutally scarrred? I don't think they're going to like you saying that.<br>  <br>  Finally, no one goes to hell for what they've done, but for who they are. May I suggest that you actually read the Bible before bashing what you think it says.<br>  <br>  "Additional Details;" Absolutey!

No of course you don't, nothing new there then :)|`|YQOT68xFaa	It is pointless to blame God for all the suffering in the world, considering that the perpetrators of the suffering are other humans. The world sucks because of our sinfulness. God has given us the means to stop, to gain victory over our sinful natures. But people love their sin too much to want to give it up. They roll in it like a dog rolling in filth. Not to mention, God gave us the mandate to take care of each other. It people are being hurt or harmed, it is up to *us* to help them. <br>  <br>  The only way to get to heaven is by faith in Jesus Christ. Nobody gets there by being a good person. Nobody earns it by suffering. The only thing God accepts is repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. That faith has to be genuine though. If a death bed conversion isn't sincere...it won't do diddly. Also, you don't go to hell for being a bad person, or being gay, or killing someone. The sins we commit set us on the path to hell, true, but the one thing that sends us there is not repenting and believing in Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  God will save anybody who asks. Nobody is beyond redemption, really. Jesus said that anyone who comes to Him will not be turned away. God loves the victim of the crime, but He also loves the perpetrator even though He hates their sin. His arms are open, waiting for both people to come to Him for salvation. The thing is, God is not a respecter of persons, but we humans think that He should be. We think He should favour those of us who are "better" and destroy those who are evil. He doesn't exactly do that though. He wants to save all of us. If the thief and murderer gets to the point in his life where he sincerely begs God for salvation, and the victim never does.....is that really God's fault? Salvation is free for the victim too.<br>  <br>  If it's any consolation, when someone "evil" gets saved they don't get off the hook. They still have to pay the price for their sins while they're here on earth.

AA10057370	Romans were before the Goths<br>  <br>  <br>  Visigoths for Kids - The Visigoths and the fall of Rome - early Middle AgesVisigoths<br>  The Visigoths established a kingdom for themselves within the collapsing Roman Empire in 418 AD. They took over most of south-western France (Aquitaine), a very fertile area which had been thickly settled by the Romans. The Visigoths at first acted more or less as representatives of the Roman government, keeping order for Rome in Aquitaine, but as time went on and Rome got weaker, the Visigoths began to act more on their own account. When the Vandals left Spain for Africa in 429 AD, the Visigoths began to take over Spain as well. They were better administrators than the Vandals had been. <br>  In 509 AD catastrophe struck the Visigothic kingdom in southern France (which is known as the Kingdom of Toulouse). The Franks, who had taken over northern France, made an effort to break through to the Mediterranean under their young king Clovis. One reason that the Visigoths and the Franks did not get along was that the Visigoths were Arian Christians while the Franks were Catholics. <br>  <br>  After a big battle at Vouillé, the Franks won, and the Visigoths lost, and their king was killed. The Franks took over most of southern France, and most of the Visigoths moved to Spain, where they founded a new capital city at Toledo (so this kingdom is known as the Kingdom of Toledo). <br>  <br>  In Spain the Visigoths fell under the control of the Ostrogoths, because the Visigoths' new king, Amalaric, was only a baby, and his powerful grandfather, Theodoric the Ostrogoth, offered to act as regent for him (to rule for Amalaric until he grew up). <br>  Then soon after Amalaric grew up he was killed, and there was soon a civil war between two men who wanted to be king, Athanagild and Agila. Athanagild, who was losing, asked the Roman Emperor Justinian to help him, and Justinian sent troops right away, who put Athanagild on the throne and killed Agila. But when Athanagild thanked the Romans and said they could go home now, the Romans said no, they were going to stay. For the next seventy years and more, the Visigoths were almost always fighting to try to get the Romans out of Spain. <br>  <br>  By 600 AD the Visigoths were the only Arians left in the Mediterranean area (or anywhere else) and finally they too converted to Catholicism, under their king Reccared. <br>  <br>   <br>  Crown of Recceswinth From 600 to 700 AD, the Visigothic kings got weaker and weaker. Even though they did finally manage to get rid of the Romans, they didn't have much power themselves. They gave away a lot of their land to reward their supporters, and they weren't strong enough to collect much in taxes.<br>  Finally in 711 AD the Arabs and Moors invaded from Africa, across the Straits of Gibraltar. They took over Spain and made it a province of the Islamic empire.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Gothic was an evolution from Romanesque with pointed arches and butresses that made large glass spaces possible|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Goths is a modern day fad.<br>  Gothic is an architectural style that was popular in the middle ages. <br>  Visigoths were tribal barbarians from Norway who plundered pillaged and raped wherever they went. <br>  None of these "goths" have anything to do with each other.|`|RoVfm2JZaa	no it doesn't, the style of some cathedrals were Gothic, it's just the architecture.|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	It is a question of Style and not Faith.|`|5shqstYraa	No, that don't prove any such thing.|`|CJs1QuXsaa	No.  Are you confusing gothic architecture with the modern "goth" subculture?

All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even one of a person's sins. <br>  <br>  Either Jesus pays for a person's sins, or that person pays for their sins in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before everyone. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|G6imVFxQaa	yous a going to hell boy! lol i would give you bible verses but i don't feel like wasting my time on someone who doesn't care what they say anyways. good luck with that whole burning thing though. you'll get a good brown even tan.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	You are going to Hell because you are one of the "Ye of little faith" heathens. <br>  <br>  Fortunately for you the evidence for the existence of Hell has not arrived (and never will).

Ms9mIgXUaa	Atheism isn't a group. We're not united by any creed or set of ideas or beliefs. All we share is a lack of belief in a deity. There are atheist conservatives, liberals, libertarians, socialists, communists and fascists. There are atheists of different races living on different continents. Each has a unique perspective on life. I wouldn't want to be compared to other atheists any more than you would want to be compared to other religious people who think it's OK to fly planes into buildings.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Not all atheists have the brain power to be Mensa Society members, you know. I've met some that are dumb as a box of rocks. Others are extremely intelligent. Some of the smart ones also lack debate skills. They have one thing in common, though - they don't believe in a higher power/deity of any sort. (Well, maybe the Flying Spaghetti Monster, but that's just a fun little joke.)<br>  <br>  To cast such a wide net (you're not really an atheist because you're not smart enough to be one) is dangerous. That's like assuming that because someone is a christian they will automatically be pleasant people. Most of the christians I've encountered in the US are downright nasty when they realize I have my own faith and have no intention of even considering converting to theirs. Christianity also doesn't automatically make you a nasty person. <br>  <br>  In my faith we place a great value on knowledge and learning. Doesn't mean we're all smart, though. There's a couple people in my Kindred I feel very sorry for as they are obviously mentally slower than the  rest of us. It doesn't mean they're not "real" Forn Sed heathens, it just means they're of only average, or slightly below IMO, intelligence.<br>  <br>  Basically, if someone self-identifies as an atheist or a christian or a pagan or a heathen, you have to take them at their word. It's what they *believe*, even if it isn't always the way they act. To automatically assume someone isn't a "real" atheist because they're not as quick of wit and tongue as some other atheist is the same as someone saying another person isn't a "real" christian because they don't behave or believe exactly the way another christian would behave or believe. Besides, you can't choose another person's faith, or lack thereof, for them based on their intelligence and/or behavior. THEY choose their belief system and how they behave. Intelligence is something we're either born with - or not.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	why would you fake something like that? also why should you have to give intelligent debate to prove you don't believe in religion?

My ex-boyfriend was a physicist and a hardcore atheist. Because he did not believe in God, God had no bearing on his life and to him was not worth discussing. His life just revolved around other things. He would never put down other people's beliefs, he didn't make a fuss if his family asked him to go to church with them once a year, and if you didn't ask him what his religious philosophy was, you would never know. Even though I'm Christian I got along with him because he wasn't belligerent about religion. But many people I run into these days seem to be atheists just because they want to be "rebels."

A friend told me it's an abbreviation of "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge,'' which was supposedly stamped on the foreheads of couples who were locked up in the stocks for fornicating without benefit of matrimony. Also, whither the expression "**** you"? I've always agreed with George Carlin, who says "unfuck you" would be a more appropriate curse, indicating you hope the person you are cursing would never enjoy the pleasure of sex again, rather than wishing them the opposite.<br>  <br>  — Lois S., Mesa, Arizona<br>  <br>  Cecil replies:<br>  <br>  This is going to be a little crude, folks, but let's try to keep a stiff upper lip. I've heard a number of variations of the "****-as-acronym" story, none of which, in my opinion (and that of most linguists), is even remotely likely: (1) It stands for "fornication under consent of the king," which was supposedly tacked up over the doors of government-approved brothels in early England. (2) It stands for "for the use of carnal knowledge," which allegedly was stamped on condoms, or, alternatively, used the same way as "for unlawful carnal knowledge."<br>  <br>  This passion for preposterous acronyms seems to be peculiar to Anglo-Americans, and some believe it started around World War I, about the same time many acronyms began popping up in government. Others I've come across include P.O.S.H. ("port outward, starboard home"), said to have been stamped on the tickets of first class passengers on India-bound British ships who wanted their cabins on the shady side of the boat during the passage through the tropics; C.O.P. ("constable on patrol"); and T.I.P. ("to insure promptness"). All are rubbish. The best guess is that "****" comes from the Middle English ******, to strike, move quickly, penetrate, from the German ficken, meaning approximately the same thing. A related word may be the Middle Dutch fokken, to strike, copulate with. We get a clue here as to the level of delicacy and tenderness that has characterized the sex act down through the ages, and which is recalled by the charming epithet "**** you."<br>  <br>  Many other possible etymologies have been offered. Some claim the F-word (sorry to have to resort to this lame expression, but you have no idea how tiresome it can be to type "****" a million times) is a truncation of "fecund." Richard Spears, author of the splendid Slang and Euphemism, says the word may be a disguise of the French foutre, same meaning, which comes from the Latin futuere. Another possible origin, Professor Spears says, is the Latin pungo, to prick. Give me a break, doc.<br>  <br>  Having totally ODed on gutter epithets, let us move briefly to the cheerful world of euphemism. Professor Spears has amassed an awesome collection of synonyms for the generative act (under "occupy," p. 278, in case you're the type who likes to look up dirty words in reference books), including the following, which gives you an idea of the never-ending richness of the English language: bang, batter, beef, bumble, blow off the loose corns, bounce the brillo, dance the buttock jig, do a dive in the dark, flimp, flurgle, foin, foraminate, futz, get one's leather stretched, get one's nuts cracked, get one's oil changed, go bird's nesting, go bush-ranging, go like a rat up a rhododendron, go star-gazing on one's back, have a bun in the oven, have a game in the cock-loft, have a leap up the ladder, have hot pudding for supper, hide the ferret, hide the salami, hide the sausage, hive it, jazz it, knock it off, lay some pipe, light the lamp, lose the lamp and pocket the stake, make her grunt, mix one's peanut butter, palliardize, pestle, pheeze, pizzle, play cars and garages, plow, plug, plook, ram, rasp, ride below the crupper, shoot between wind and water, strop one's beak, varnish one's cane, wet one's wick, wind the clock, and work the hairy oracle--some 675 synonyms in all. The ingenuity displayed in this, ahh, well-plowed ground is nothing short of awesome.<br>  <br>  THE BARD GETS INTO THE ACT<br>  <br>      Dear Cecil:<br>  <br>      I hate to point this out, but you failed to mention something in your recent discussion of the origin of a certain four-letter word. I did some research and found one of the origins in a book called Shakespeare's Bawdy, which says that the word comes from "foculation," meaning to engage in intercourse. The book I mentioned is a look at sex in Shakespeare. --Melissa Z., Chicago|`|f6qmRicQaa	I found this when looking online for the origin of the word, this best sums up what I found.<br>  "The idea that **** is an acronym, let alone a Victorian acronym, is an urban myth. **** has been around a lot longer.<br>  <br>  The first recorded usage of the word was in 1503, in a poem by Scottish poet William Dunbar. The origins of the word, however, are somewhat murky.<br>  <br>  Amongst the Germanic languages (which include English) there are many similar words which mean the same thing. There is the Middle Dutch fokken, meaning "to thrust, copulate with"; Norwegian dialect Furja: "to copulate"; and Swedish dialect focka, meaning "to strike, push, copulate", not to mention the German "ficken". Some scholars derive the word from the latin futuo, others from the Indo-European root peuk, meaning "to prick".<br>  <br>  Whatever its origin, it is clear that it's been enlivening the English language for quite some time.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** IS NOT AN ACRONYM. This is an urban-myth.<br>  <br>  It doesn't stand for "for unlawful carnal knowledge". It doesn't stand for "forniction under king's consent" (whatever "forniction" is, that would make the acronym "FUKC" for ****'s sake!) and it doesn't stand for "Fornicating Under Consent of the King"<br>  <br>  I'm accurate with my information, the word **** has been around since before the 16th century. And in case you didn't get the message:<br>  <br>  **** IS NOT -REPEAT- IS NOT AN ACRONYM."|`|qq5nceCXaa	Word History: The obscenity **** is a very old word and has been considered shocking from the first, though it is seen in print much more often now than in the past. Its first known occurrence, in code because of its unacceptability, is in a poem composed in a mixture of Latin and English sometime before 1500. The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge, England, takes its title, "Flen flyys," from the first words of its opening line, "Flen, flyys, and freris," that is, "fleas, flies, and friars." The line that contains **** reads "Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk." The Latin words "Non sunt in coeli, quia," mean "they [the friars] are not in heaven, since." The code "gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk" is easily broken by simply substituting the preceding letter in the alphabet, keeping in mind differences in the alphabet and in spelling between then and now: i was then used for both i and j; v was used for both u and v; and vv was used for w. This yields "fvccant [a fake Latin form] vvivys of heli." The whole thus reads in translation: "They are not in heaven because they **** wives of Ely [a town near Cambridge]."|`|CmxJdPh2aa	best answer=JEN!!!  <br>  the german "fokken" is what i first thought of...<br>  jen explains it best and most accurately, from my understanding of the root of said expletive. <br>  i must say though, i didn't bother reading the answer after hers as it was WAY too long and seemed copy and pasted anyways...cheater.

The best one can hope for is decide on the Mathematical concept of probability to give us a sense of the issue and assign a value for God's existence (And by definition all other concepts like heaven and hell associated with It.) or non-existence in percentage terms. One final twist even further complicates the issue; even in Mathematics, there are three different schools of thought in respect to the concept of probability. Therefore, no matter how you look at it, at some point in time you will need a leap of faith. The only reasonable thing to do under the circumstance is to set one self some validation procedure or threshold and then look for the answer to ones satisfaction.

p5cglKf0aa	The Seventh Letter<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  In His Name, be he Glorified!<br>  <br>  And there, is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise..<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  May peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings for ever and ever.<br>  <br>  My Dear Brothers!<br>  <br>  I gather you told Tamly Hafyz to ask me two things:<br>  <br>  <br>  THE FIRST<br>  <br>  “Like the dissemblers in early times, the people of misguidance of modern times also make the Prophet’s (Upon whom be blessings and peace) marriage with Zaynab a pretext for criticism, considering it to have been to satisfy the lusts of the soul.”<br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r : God forbid, a hundred thousand times! The hand of such vile doubts cannot reach up to that elevated one! Yes, he was such that from the age of f fifteen to forty when the blood is fiery and exuberant and the passions of the soul enf1amed, sufficed and was content with a single older woman like Khadija the Great (May God be pleased with her) with complete chastity and purity - as is agreed by friend and foe alike. His then having numerous wives after the age of forty, that is, when bodily heat subsides and the passions are quitened, is evidence proving decisively and self-evidently to those who are even a little fair-minded that such marriages were not to satisfy the carnal appetites, but were based on other important instances of wisdom. <br>  <br>  One of those instances of wisdom is this: Like the Prophet’s words, his actions, states, conduct, and deeds are the sources of religion and the Shari’a, and the authority for its injunctions. Just as the Companions transmitted the outward, public things, the transmitters and narrators Of the private matters of religion and injunctions of the Shari’a which were manifested from his private conduct in the personal sphere, were his wives, and they carried out that duty in fact. Perhaps half of the private matters and injunctions of religion come from them. That is to say, numerous wives of differing temperament were required to perform this necessary duty.<br>  <br>  Now let us consider his marriage with Zaynab. In connection with the verse,<br>  <br>  Muhammed is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] the Prophet of God and the Seal of the Prophets,<br>  <br>  which is one of the examples given in the Third Ray of the First Light in the Twenty-Fifth Word, it is written that with its many aspects, a single verse states meanings appropriate to the understandings of all classes of men.<br>  <br>  <br>  One class’s share of understanding of the above verse is this: according to a sound narration based on his own admission, Zayd, the Most Noble Prophet’s (Upon whom be blessings and peace) servant whom he addressed as “my son,” divorced his proud wife because he did not find himself equal to her. That is to say, with his perceptiveness, Zayd realized that Zaynab had been created with an elevated character different to his and that it was in her nature to be a prophet’s wife. And since he found himself to be by nature unequal to her as a spouse and this caused incompatibility, he divorced her. At God's command, the Most Noble Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace) took her. That is, as indicated by the verse,<br>  <br>  We joined her in marriage to you<br>  <br>  showing that it was a heavenly contract, this marriage was out of the ordinary, above external relations, and purely on the orders of Divine Determining. Thus, the Most Noble Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace) submitted to the decree of Divine Determining and was compelled to do so; it was not at the behest of carnal desire.<br>  <br>  The verse,<br>  <br>  In order that [in future] there may be no difficulty to the believers<br>  <br>  in [the matter of] marriage with the wives of their adopted sons,<br>  <br>  comprises an important injunction of the Shari’a, a general instance of wisdom, and a comprehensive, general benefit pertaining to this decree of Divine Determining, and indicates that adults calling the young “my son” is not forbidden, as is the matter of zihar, that is, a man saying to his wife “you are like my mother,” so that ordinances should change due to it? Also, rulers looking to their subjects and prophets looking to their communities and addressing them in fatherly fashion, is due to the function of prophethood; it is not in respect of their human personalities so that it should be inappropriate for them to take wives from them?<br>  <br>  Another class’s share of the understanding of this verse is this: a great ruler looks on his subjects with paternal compassion. If he is a spiritual king holding both outward and inward rule, since his compassion is a hundred times greater than that of a father, his subjects look on him as his father, as though they were his real sons. A father’s view is not easily transformed into that of a husband, and a girl’s view into that of a wife. So, since according to this it is inappropriate in the public view for a prophet to take in marriage the believers’ daughters, with the purpose of repelling such a doubt, the Qur'an says: “On account of Divine mercy the Prophet has compassion for you, he deals with you in fatherly fashion, and in the name of prophethood you are like his children. But in regard to his human personality he is not your father so that it should be inappropriate for him to take a wife from among you!? And if he calls you “Son,” in respect of the rulings of the Shari’a, you cannot be his children!..."<br>  <br>  <br>  The Enduring One, He is the Enduring One!<br>  <br>  Said Nursi<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2938&t=The+Seventh+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2938&...</a>|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Lol.

Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, "Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck." Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.<br>  <br>  there are lots of saying about wether she was 25 or 9 or 18 this is what i think and that most of the islamic knowledge shows but sister ... only Allah knows !! <br>  <br>   Allah knows the best|`|4wH3Hvcxaa	People are allowed to post whatever they want on youtube, so as long as it does not violate the guidelines.

That's the first sign of brainwashing.<br>  <br>  I ask you this: Is morality completely dependent and subject to cultural and societal norms?  Is there really no such thing as Good and Evil?<br>  <br>  For example, the cultural and societal norm of the Aztecs was to perform human sacrifices on a regular basis.  The Aztecs believed that if they did not present the gods with the beating hearts of their victims, the sun would stop moving across the sky.<br>  <br>  So, it was completely "moral" in that society.<br>  <br>  But does that make it truly moral?
AA11796124	ANOINTING OF THE SICK - Sacrament of the New Law, instituted by Christ to give the sick spiritual aid and strength and to perfect spiritual health, including, if need be, the remission of sins. Conditionally it also restores bodily health to Christians who are seriously ill. It consists essentially in the anointing by a priest of the forehead and the hands, while pronouncing the words "Through this holy anointing and His most loving mercy, may the Lord assist you by the grace of the Holy Spirit, so that, freed from your sins, He may save you and in His goodness raise you up." In case of necessity, a singly anointing of the forehead or of an other suitable part of the body suffices. Olive oil, blessed by a bishop, is normally used for the anointing, but any vegetable oil may be substituted in case of emergency. <br>  <br>  The institution of anointing by Christ is an article of the Catholic faith, defined by the Council of Trent (Denzinger 1716). The Church further teaches that this sacrament is implied in Gospel reference to Christ sending out the disciples, who "anointed many sick people with oil and cured them" (Mark 6:13); moreover that the sacrament was promulgated by the Apostle James when he wrote, "Is anyone among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick man and the Lord will raise him up and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him" (James 5:14-15). <br>  <br>  Your best source for anything Catholic is the Catechism of the Catholic Church.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	if memory serves me right only the priest or deacon can do that. but if there is danger of death and a person is not baptized lay people can baptize in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.|`|vouUQQzBaa	You mean Viaticum?

For local fund raising, depending on the type, casual is appropriate but for campaigning I'd wear business formal, just like the Republicans do  except in your style.   Being dressed to the nines is for balls and celebrations, not campaigning, regardless of what party you belong to.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	id go for a classy casual look.<br>  <br>  something that is between informal and formal.<br>  <br>  like a pair of black pants.<br>  and a nice blue, or red, or white or brown blouse.<br>  <br>  and some jewelry (if you wear jewelry).|`|e8lAALzgaa	I would wear business attire. A nice skirt and blouse, some heels and a little jewelry. I don't think you have to be too formal for a gathering like this. Unless it is a black tie event.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Clothes|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Dress in something that is red, white, and blue.

Vl5IJ7ggaa	looks like you found a very nice guy mmm. I really like the tattooo and it wouldn't even bother me. His body is really nice and those lips wow!!!<br>  <br>  My advice to you: hold on tight to what you have. Just remember there's always someone willing to take your place. You're lucky if you are only worrying about a dang tattooo.|`|ilV7PClvaa	I think it looks fine.<br>  <br>  Er, what kind of girlfriend posts pics of her boyfriend on the internet in the hopes that hudnreds of strangers will laugh at him?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Forgive me, I didn't read your username.<br>  <br>  And it makes no difference. You're still trying to make him feel like crap by having him ridiculed by people he's never met.|`|8a792fdc296b3b2fdf9a85ee2d7b2cf1aa	Not to be mean but that isn't a tattoo I care for.

And another guy tattooed that on his arm. His wife was pissed (especially since it's like twentieth tattoo he has).|`|SMHnpVraaa	I like it and if he likes it you should accept that.  I'm sure if you really wanted something and liked it you would want him to accept that too...I know I would.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	It looks creepy. Sorry! >.<       It's cause of the face. If it was a bit of a tribal symbol, then it would've worked. But to me, it's a bit off. :/|`|IJMyRWp4aa	i think it looks great honestly and i dont want to start anything but you said to be honest and honestly just because you're dating doesnt give you the right to tell him what to do with his own body.|`|bXF1gDTcaa	looks stupid, almost girly. sorry. its okay, my boyfriend a big stupid dragon on his arm with pink and purple and blue and yellow. i make a face everytime i look at it.|`|PJCoQiqcaa	I think you should let him express himself however he wants to.  If you don't like something as tiny as a tattoo then there probably isn't a lot else that you can accept about him.|`|K2SOMH6iaa	that tatoo isn't THAT bad, to be honest, i think it's kind of cool. it's not your choice what he does with his body, anyway. if i was you, i'd worry about that moustache.|`|97sKOWQ0aa	With his body he doesn't need a tattoo to be noticed.|`|naqawnpJaa	Its ******* ugly dude, i do not like tattoos!|`|Owa7rt9Naa	If that's him it doesn't look badly done.

mGfCY4Ytaa	it is believed that it is thousands of years old. Evidence of using the finger has been found in ancient Roman writings and ancient Greek plays. However some people claim that it began during the Hundred Years war, when the French would cut off the middle finger of English archers so that they could not easily use a bow and arrow. Then after a battle in which the tides turned in the English favor, the English soldiers began to give the French the finger to show that they still had them.<br>  <br>  I think the ancient Roman and Greek findings are pretty irrefutable. Nobody knows for sure exactly when it started, but I would say that a safe answer would be in ancient Greek and Roman civilization.

k03dYskYaa	The founder of the Church of Satan explains why, as reported in ’Teen magazine of June 1993: “Instead of commanding members to repress their natural urges, we teach that they should follow them. This includes physical lust, the desire for revenge, the drive for material possessions.”<br>  <br>  1993, in New Jersey, U.S.A., two 15-year-old boys brutally killed a family’s pet Labrador dog named Princess. “It was a sacrifice for Satan,” they claimed. They held the dog up by her chain, kicked her to death, ripped her tongue out and used it in a satanic ritual. They impaled the mutilated body of the dog on a large metal hook and hung it in a neighbor’s yard. Satanic markings were found on the dog’s head, and a pentagram (a five-pointed star in a circle—a Satanic symbol) was etched on the ground beneath the dog’s body. On the night of the killing, they were listening to Deicide (which means murder of God), a death-metal band, whose lead singer boasts of torturing and killing animals.<br>  <br>  Satanism is on the rise. It is a growing menace, but its demise is imminent. Its god is under sentence of death. So is Satan’s world and its supporters, for “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1?John 5:19; Romans 6:16) To Satan’s worshipers and to all others who are knowingly or unknowingly serving Satan’s purposes, Jehovah’s message is: “The God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.”—Romans 16:20.|`|SGSl5yeAaa	The "symbol" of Satanism is a upside-down pentagram with a goat head in it.<br>  <br>  They follow Satan as a sort of "freedom-fighter" believing his rebellion against God noble somehow.  They are into the occult, magic, etc., and try to please Satan for earthly power.<br>  <br>  That's all I know... and I could be wrong.|`|kE29abUUaa	Satanism is actually an atheist philosophy and doesn't actually have anything to do with Satan. It's called Satanism simply because of its symbolic challenging of religious faiths.<br>  <br>  Humanism is the basic philosophy for all people and its what Atheists follow, and most of them follow it unknowingly, since it's something that's simply programmed into us when we grew up. Religious or non-religious alike. Humanism is about compassion and understanding for your fellow humans.<br>  <br>  Satanism however is about self-indulgence. Looking out for yourself rather than others, which is the opposite of Humanism. Satanists don't worship a Satan, because they don't believe in a Satan. They don't believe in angels, demons, anything supernatural, just like every other atheists. Satanism is just a philosophy to live your life by. The name is simply symbolic because of its opposition to religion.<br>  <br>  Satanism has absolutely nothing to do with religion at all.<br>  (Except for Luciferianism, which is the theocratic form of Satanism. Luciferianism is the actual belief in a Satan and the worship of said Satan)|`|i6QfwNTJaa	symbol is the pentagram. but it beats me what they believe, and surely dont care.<br>  there is no god, and the devil does not exist either.<br>  so what do u think of ppl who worship icons? whether if it's a cross or a pentagram.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	the symbol is a five pointed star turned upside down... the two top star tips are the horns, the bottom is the beard, next two bottom are ear lobes|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	They don't worship God in heaven. <br>  <br>  Period.|`|AA11234408	There are many symbols in Satanism that relate to Spiritual Alchemy which is mediation upon your soul to empower it. Some of these symbols include the point down pentagram, the baphomet, the Star of Astaroth, and the caduceus but there are many more symbols that relate to Spiritual Alchemy in Satanism. For instance the point down pentagram represents the male and female energies of your soul merged which brings enlightenment. <br>  <br>  "There is no place in the Universe that is void of my presence" - Satan <br>  <br>  So you could say that Satanism is everywhere. It is not mainstream if that is what you want to know.<br>  <br>  If you want to know the basic beliefs of Satanism and a whole lot more about Satanism I would suggest you read this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.joyofsatan.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.joyofsatan.org</a> It has tons of info on Spiritual Satanism which in my opinion is the only "real" Satanism. Hope this helped you out.<br>  <br>  I live in the USA.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Satanism has many appropriated symbols of Druidism/Wiccan belief systems.  The pentagram (five-pointed open star) is wrongly attributed to satanists.  Look for the 666 mark...<br>  Satanists believe in this world and in power; in using evil means to attain worldly goods.  They believe that by 'trading' their soul for power they will share Satan's power in Hell. They are in for a surprise.|`|2iwOIskRaa	There are many Satanistic sects but the most would say Satanism is about Self Indulgience and pretty much taking what you want, living without boundries and looking out for yourself and those who deserve it rather than giving help to those who don't deserve it. To put it simple.<br>  <br>  The Goat head thats you often see ont he 5 pointed star is the representation of mans carnal nature. <br>  <br>  I could go on but i don't want to rant xD<br>  <br>  actually " Atheist Ad Infinitum " has summed it up rather well.|`|FxVRPIm3aa	Here's a picture of the symbol.<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Baphosimb.gif/150px-Baphosimb.gif" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  LaVeyan Satanists are atheists. They do not believe in Satan or any other form of deities. Satan is used as a metaphor of mankinds true nature. They generally believe anything goes as long as it doesn't harm others, sort of a live and let live kind of attitude.

ODf41iN4aa	We'll assume you're female since you're looking for something cute.  Seems like you could just wear anything along with a shamrock sticker on your cheek or hand.  Even the T-shirts look like a waste of money to me.  Still, here are a few suggestions:<br>  <br>  You could wear a slinky green sheath knit dress or a sweater & slacks.  That's assuming you don't live in a very warm climate, such as S. California, though even there, the evenings can be chilly.  If it's too warm, you could wear a long-sleeved Henley over a T-shirt or tank.  There's also the option of long dress & knit shawl.  Whether you choose green sweater or dress or just a few green shamrock accents depends on your coloring & what is flattering.<br>  <br>  Or you could dress up a little more.  You could wear most anything with a dark green head-hugging felt hat like the cloche hats of the 20's & 30's.  Would be stunning with most any kind of feminine dress, whether slinky knit or old-fashioned print or high-fashion.  Try the dept. stores & the retro-clothing & even big box & thrift shop stores for such a hat.  With any luck, there might be something left in winter close-outs.  If you don't see a dressy felt one, look at the knit ones...not as cool as the felt ones, but could still be attractive.  I just looked online at felt cloche hats, & they're way too expensive unless you're wealthy.  Besides, you must try on hats to find one that fits & is flattering.  I would look at the $5-$20 range & not the $200 range.  <br>  <br>  Even look at low-priced stores like Sears for dresses.  I saw a black cocktail dress in their Dec. ad with flounced skirt that reminded me of bygone era, though I don't know exactly which era...maybe the 30's.  Would still look fine with a shawl & a green felt cloche hat. <br>  <br>  So, whether casual & modern or dressy classics, I would stick to cute & not make it cutesy, thus avoiding white blouse with green bow-tie or any leprechaun costume.  Ditto for knee socks & pleated skirts.  If you wear something too much like a costume, people might think you work there & try to give you their orders for drinks.  It's better to go for classy.<br>  <br>  Mostly you would probably be happiest in something flattering & that you'd wear at other times.  In this economy, don't throw away your money on a one-time-only costume beyond  an accessory.<br>  <br>  As for me, I'll probably wear one of several prs of brown cord & green sweaters that I already have, maybe with a hat, now that I started thinking about hats, & a shamrock sticker on my cheek.  I'll skip the bars altogether & get off the streets as soon as possible after getting off work at 7.  Might be too many drunks driving around.  Nevertheless, have fun.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Tinkerbell costume!<br>  Or if you prefer "the green fairy" since it is a day of drinking after all!<br>  My friends and I went as that last year and somehow managed to get in free at the door!|`|xJBJn6dOaa	I saw a girl last year wearing shorts (with black tights and boots), and green suspenders!

iH7ZB5Soaa	It's a possible goal.Here are some principles for this goal:<br>  F i r s t P r i n c i p l e : When you know your way and opinions to be true, you have the right to say, “My way is right and the best.” But you do not have the right to say, “Only my way is right.” According to the sense of “The eye of contentment is too dim to perceive faults; it is the eye of anger that exhibits all vice;” your unjust view and distorted opinion cannot be the all-decisive judge and cannot condemn the belief of another as invalid.<br>  S e c o n d P r i n c i p l e : It is your right that all that you say should be true, but not that you should say all that is true. For one of insincere intention may sometimes take unkindly to advice, and react against it unfavourably.<br>  T h i r d P r i n c i p l e : If you wish to nourish enmity, then direct it against the enmity in your heart, and attempt to rid yourself of it. Be an enemy to your evil-commanding soul and its caprice and attempt to reform it, for it inflicts more harm on you than all else. Do not engage in enmity against other believers on account of that injurious soul. Again, if you wish to cherish enmity, there are unbelievers and atheists in great abundance; be hostile to them. In the same way that the attribute of love is fit to receive love as its response, so too enmity will receive enmity as its own fitting response. If you wish to defeat your enemy, then respond to his evil with good. For if you respond with evil, enmity will increase, and even though he will be outwardly defeated, he will nurture hatred in his heart, and hostility will persist. But if you respond to him with good, he will repent and become your friend. The meaning of the lines: If you treat the noble nobly, he will be yours, and if you treat the vile nobly, he will revolt, is that it is the mark of the believer to be noble, and he will become submitted to you by noble treatment. And even if someone is apparently ignoble, he is noble with respect to his belief. It often happens that if you tell an evil man, “You are good, you are good,” he will become good; and if you tell a good man, “You are bad, you are bad,” he will become bad. Hearken, therefore, to these sacred principles of the Qur’an, for happiness and safety are to be found in them:<br>  If they pass by futility, they pass by it in honourable disdain. * If you forgive, pardon, and relent, verily God is All-Relenting, Merciful.<br>  F o u r t h P r i n c i p l e : Those who cherish rancour and enmity transgress against their own souls, their brother believer, and Divine mercy. For such a person condemns his soul to painful torment with his rancour and enmity. He imposes torment on his soul whenever his enemy receives some bounty, and pain from fear of him. If his enmity arises from envy, then it is the most severe form of torment. For envy in the first place consumes and destroys the envier, and its harm for the one envied is either slight or nonexistent.|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	Unity starts upon worshiping Allaah alone, not setting any partners along with Him in worship. And we must follow the actual teachings of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and the understanding of the Qur'aan and Prophetic life example that he actually taught to his family, companions, and followers.<br>  <br>  Unity based on other than that, or based upon falsehood (like uniting with groups that alter the perfect religion of Allaah, thereby innovating a way of life that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell) is futile and not pleasing to our Creator.|`|E70jju0baa	"Muslims must be united with each other.

They must not consider borders to be a cause of the separation of hearts. The borders are separated but the hearts must be unified. Muslims have incredible strength and rich resources. If they are together, if Muslims are unified, they would not need any other country - almost all other countries would need them."<br>  <br>  Ayatollah Khomeini<br>   Sahifah Noor, v.10, p.223, 1979|`|6jCe21Plaa	Some peoples wanted to see the truth in someones else,but they are blind by not correcting them self, this is where Unity is so difficult.<br>  To be unity,is to realized that all Muslims are Brothers & Sisters...<br>  & also got to learn to be patient.<br>  Patient is half of the Iman. Prophet Muhammad(Saw) ever said...<br>  The only Biggest WAR among you...is to fight against your own self desire.|`|AA11097451	it is predicted by Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) that there will be sects in Islam.<br>  <br>  So i guess the best thing to do is to keep self away from it ......... and discourage it when it is committed by others.|`|bs9Zbouaaa	by removing our differences.|`|zBqt99avaa	Amirah:<br>  <br>  Look at how unity has been accomplished already.  Religions are almost never unified, and neither are countries.  But one country I know of has many different faces but generally speaking, supports its various members through thick and thin.  Canada.<br>  <br>  There are problems, yes, but by and large, we've combined people from hundreds of backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, etc., into one country that mostly gets along.<br>  <br>  Historically, the driving force for unity was the common dangers new immigrants faced.  The terrible winters, for example, provided an "outside enemy" that needed to be conquered, and could not defeated without a group effort.  This forced people to work together for the benefit of all.  Although we now have the infrastructure to make our terrible winters more bearable, we still maintain that philosophy today, with many social programs aimed at helping the weak, etc., live a better life.<br>  <br>  If Muslims want to do the same, an outside enemy is certainly one way.  But an enemy in the form of a person, race or religion is dangerous, since unification against them will probably result in action, and any action taken against them will have a reaction which could bring about further disunity.  Moreover, the outside threat has to be maintained, so that unity is maintained.  Therefore, no true peace is ever accomplished.<br>  <br>  So it would be better to look at how Canadians cope with these issues today.<br>  <br>  First, you have to see everyone as your fellow man, struggling for the same things on earth:  food, shelter, happiness, peace, comfort.<br>  <br>  Islam teaches equality.  The first rule of dealing with your fellow humans is not to force them to accept your beliefs.  Therefore, if a Sunni or Shia person thinks the other is wrong, they have the right to say so.  Then they have the obligation to be quiet.<br>  <br>  I may not like the niqab.  Islamically, I think it is bida'.  Socially, I think it is an unnecessary and aggressive form of segregation.  It is a rejectionist act.  <br>  <br>  However, it doesn't matter how I feel about it.  It doesn't matter that I'm not Muslim.  I  would defend anyone's right to wear it.  Because I see the person first, as an equal, deserving of the right to choose their own life, in any way that does not damage me or others.<br>  <br>  If Muslims did this with each other, made a conscious decision to support one another as humans first, and disagree about Islam second, you would have unity.  Unity doesn't mean you agree on every subject.  It simply means you work together for the common good.  That you allow differences to fall to the background where they belong, and focus on what you accomplish.<br>  <br>  It is a possibility only when people are willing to put their egos aside and approach their fellow man with humility and kindness.  Possible?  Yes.  Likely?  I hope so.|`|3E2EQH12aa	wa salaam. futile. how long have we been split? and why would it change now? no ones going to accept the others belief.. so whatev|`|N8QLKpCMaa	W.A.S !<br>  <br>  unity consist of mutual love,tolerance & respect , it is inevitable that we may not have differences , but the skill & unity lies in living together with our differences.<br>  whether we agree with s/o 's thoughts or believes or not but respecting is required for unity.<br>  rather then wording ummah must be practically united as they are different parts of one body !|`|K5nwQfnjaa	Unity to be real must stand the severest strain without breaking because with Unity we stand, divided we fall.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why is it that an extended olive branch often turns to a clinched fist of hatred?|`|kkO87h0Xaa	I think the strife to achieve unity itself, is an example of unity.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	By accepting the differences.

Allah raised them to represent Allah and made them special model men for the guidance of people. . <br>  Prophets never committed sins. They made judgmental errors like all other humans. Allah has corrected few judgmental eorrs of Prophet Mohammad and made those corrections of Allah  part of Quran, so people do not worship Prophet instead of Allah.  Prophet Mohammad made it <br>  <br>  How do you like the story.  I heard this story from our Imam on one Friday sermon. haram to make his image so Muslims do not make his pictures and statues fearing that they might start worshipping him like Hindus made idols of their Prophets and started worshipping their idols  hundreds of years later after their death. <br>  <br>  I remember one error of Prophet Abraham AS for to you know he also made judgmental errors. Abraham never liked to eat by himself. He always had some one eat with him. One day no one was with thim to eat. So he stood out of his house to find some one to eat with him. He stopped an old man and said come and eat with me.  So he came and sat with Abraham.  Abraham asked the man, do you believe in Allah.  He said.  Neither I believe in Allah nor I worship Him. Abraham got mad and said get out of here in anger. Right away Allah sent His Angel who  conveyed Allah's message to Abraham saying, " I fed that man all his life  and you could not feed him one mean"?  Abraham rushed back after the man. He apologized to man and brought him back. The man came in  and said I don't understand you first kicked me out and now bring me back to eat with you.   Abraham said, Allah sent His Angel to me for you  and said  I fed this man all his life, and you refused to feed him one meal?  So I had to bring you back and ask you to apologize me for my error.<br>  <br>  The man said Allah sent Angel to you to feed me? Abraham said Yes, that is why I rushed out to bring you back. I love my Allah and can never make him unhappy to me.  Then man  said, "I bear witness that there is one God Almighty who feeds all His creationns".  and he became Muslim.<br>  <br>  How do you like the story?

AA10478980	I think that person would be considered part of Generation Y.  Generation X is a term used to describe a group of people born from 1964 to the mid or late 1970s in the United States and Canada.  Generation Y, sometimes referred to as "Millennials" or "Net Generation", whose birth years range anywhere from the second half of the 1970's to around the year 2000, depending on the source, grew up in the 1990s and 2000s.|`|eskZfVBkaa	Y.|`|X05GAaLeaa	No , it would be gereration y<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I got this from a website<br>  wikidpedia is not accurate , anyone can change it<br>  <br>  <br>  By studying birth patterns from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Demographics found that Gen Y, too, can be looked at in terms of three distinct age groups. Gen Y is usually defined as those born between the years 1977 and 1994; the youngest in this generation is 7 years old this year, the oldest 24. We found that 36 percent of this generation has reached adulthood; this year they will be between the ages of 18 and 24. Another 34 percent are teens, currently 12- to 17-years-old; 30 percent are pre-pubescent "'tweens," ranging in age from 7 to 11 this year|`|sxmQSpagaa	Y.|`|JWNzoksmaa	Gen Y|`|kqMDzJw0aa	X|`|v4MguQ3iaa	I just took a diversity training for work (HR) and I am pretty sure that 1980 is the year that is in between Gen X and Gen Y.

Asian cultures seem to take a long time to change, and it sometimes holds people back from bigger better things. <br>  <br>  I know some Asian cultures are VERY ethnocentric. Most of those Asians on the Continent for example, don't really like the Japanese. And I don't think the Japanese, are very open to other cultures either.<br>  <br>  This presents its own set of problems.<br>  <br>  I also consider India part of Asia, and they still have a caste system, which is based some on religious beliefs and tradition.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't think Asia is any more "on track" than any of the rest of the people of the world who believe in the God of Abraham.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	It is also largely gaining Christian followers.

VWvI5RyBaa	Nature is primarily what connects me to spirituality.  I live in the country and have the blessing to have the forest on one side and the ocean behind my house.  I live in Canada, in the Atlantic where you can have the four seasons in one day.  It can be freezing(-30°C), a few hours later it can go up to around +10°C which feels like Fall or Spring, and it can keep going up until it's in the 20's which is like Summer.  Some days, you can have snow, freezing rain, rain and then sun.  It's quite amazing but one needs to keep a positive attitude though, as well as dressing in layers if you don't want to freeze or be extremely warm.  You also have typical seasons like we've been having this winter.  It's already the 6th of March, 06:00 AM and it's -20°C, will be -3°C in the afternoon and +4°C tomorrow.  Nature is truly incredible.  I love the forest and there are nice trails to jog or hike.  My favourite though is the ocean, so much water, can be calm one moment and ferocious the next.  The air feels so fresh, you want to take as many breaths as you can take, how wonderful if you could put some in a bottle to bring home with you, although I can certainly smell and feel the breeze from the ocean from our house.  The water can be such a clear blue or become gray.  The tide goes up and down at regular interval and you can walk on the beach, look at the water and see all kind of creatures.  On the edge you can see little fish, crabs, etc. and every creature has a different place created exactly for their survival.  How can't you feel the power of God in such incredible perfection?|`|e50c8aae94677952ee9beadc76ab4c1baa	Well nature is God, Teacher, an ideal good model to emulate, Why?<br>  It is giving so much to the society without any expectations of a reward from us.

Any attempt to reduce Bible interpretation to an academic exercise is destined to fail.<br>  Without him we can see nothing 1 Corinthians 3:18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a “fool” so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness” Correct Bible interpretation is found through a living relationship – heart to heart communion – with the Author. Biblical truth is discovered by getting to know a person, because Truth is a person – the Lord Jesus Christ. I’m all for study but it is important that we don’t let an intellectual approach to the Bible reduce to sterile study what should be the pinnacle of holy intimacy. That would be like trying to reduce romance to chemical equations. Correctly interpreting Scripture is as intimate as feeling a loved one’s breath on your cheek as he shares his deepest secrets.This is why Scripture does not give us lessons in hermeneutics but instead emphasizes spiritual and heart issues. In fact, one of the frustrations of modern Bible scholars is that often not even the inspired writers of Scripture followed the principles of Bible interpretation promoted by today’s theologians!....Correctly interpreting the Word of God is as supernatural and as dependent upon the Holy Spirit as the original writing of the Bible. <br>  <br>  2 Peter 1:20-21 First of all, you must understand that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. (RSV)<br>  <br>  The Bible is a book with supernatural origins divinely intended to be understood only by people who can tap into the supernatural. <br>  <br>  Without good hermeneutics we would be off with the fairies but without personal divine enlightenment we would be equally lost. The Bible is our map; the Holy Spirit is our guide. The scale of the map is so large that we need the guide. The guide is so softly spoken that we need the map to confirm that we have correctly heard. Without close attention to both we’ll get lost. This is not because of any deficiency in either of them. It was always intended that they would work together. <br>  <br>  “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God,” chided Jesus (Matthew 22:29). We swell with pride. Jesus’ rebuke does not apply to us! He then went on to say that God telling Moses, “I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” proves that the dead are raised. Who of us would have gleaned that from this Scripture?<br>  <br>  About those Jews whose intense Bible study actually stopped them from becoming Christians, Paul wrote:<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 3: 14-16 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant [the Old Testament] is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. <br>  <br>  Those who were so tragically mistaken in their understanding of Scripture lacked neither intelligence nor knowledge. In fact, they were superior in both departments to most Christians. As Paul wrote: <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1:19-29 For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.” Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. . . . Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential . . . God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise . . . so that no one may boast before him. <br>  <br>  It wasn’t intelligence or knowledge, but a spiritual blockage that kept these Jews blinded to the truth.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	JESUS is God  :)  Jesus is Wisdom<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Yesterday.<br>  Today we look for Wed Enlightenment.|`|80fWQyDnaa	So near but so far away !

According to sound narrations, when at the terror of the Resurrection everyone, and even the prophets, will cry out for themselves, the Most Noble Prophet will demonstrate his pity and compassion by calling out: "My Community! My Community!" Like, as affirmed by those who uncover the mysteries of creation, when he was born, his mother heard among his supplications the words: "My Community! My Community!" Also, the whole history of his life, as well as the kind and compassionate conduct which he propagated demonstrate his perfect compassion and clemency. So too through displaying an infinite need for the innumerable prayers of his Community, he showed a boundless compassion; for he showed that out of his perfect compassion he was concerned with the happiness of all of them. Thus, you can understand how lacking in gratitude and conscience it is not to observe the Practices of so kind and compassionate a leader. <br>  <br>  SECOND POINT <br>  Among the universal and general duties of his prophethood, the Most Noble Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him) displayed great compassion in certain particular, minor matters. Superficially, his expending great compassion on such matters seems inappropriate to the supreme importance of the function of prophethood. But in reality minor matters such as those were the tips or samples of a chain which could be the means to the fulfilment of a universal and general function of prophethood. Therefore the greatest importance was given to the sample for the sake of the mighty chain.<br>  <br>  For example, the extraordinary compassion the Most Noble Prophet (PBUH) showed towards Hasan and Husain in their childhood and the great importance he gave them was not only due to love arising from natural kindness and family feeling, it was rather because they were each the tip of a luminous thread of the function of prophethood, and the source, sample, and index of a community of great consequence which would receive the legacy of prophethood.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2904&t=The+Fourth+Flash" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2904&...</a>|`|cLdpKqxeaa	he is the illegitimate offspring of aisha thats why|`|lljK4HfHaa	Who's Rafidah and who's Khosrau??<br>  <br>  @asker - oh.. k ty|`|jOmw6wHxaa	Brother Down.<br>  <br>  The Same user give you answer from three different accounts.

Before he accepted Islam, in every battle, he used to enter the battlefield challenging the Prophet Muhammad(pbuh).But each time the Prophet(pbuh)'s majesty and nobility seemed to spread an aura which entered the heart of Khalid bin Waleed.On one occasion when the Prophet(pbuh) was leading the afternoon prayers(Zohr) in the battlefield, with his army behind him, Khalid bin Waleed was tempted to take advantage of this opportunity and attack the muslims who would thereby suffer irreocable losses.But some invisible force seemed to hold him back and he could not muster up enough courage to do it. The same episode happened during the early evening prayer(Asr) and Khalid bin Waleed realised that some unseen power was protecting the Prophet(pbuh) and surely on day he would conquer not only the whole of Arabia but the entire world.<br>  <br>  When the Prophet(pbuh) signed the peace treaty of Hudaybiyah (read Muhammad(pbuh)'s biography) , Khalid bin Waleed wondered what would follow next and thought about his own future.He could not seem to decide whether he wanted to give up his warrior's life or not.At this moment, he got a letter from his brother who had converted to Islam.He wrote in very affectionate terms that the Prophet(pbuh) had asked him where Khalid bin Waleed was.He had answered respectfullly that Allah Almighty would surely one day bring Khalid bin Waleed to the Prophet(pbuh) to embrace Islam.It was not possible, he told him that his intelligent, perspective and able brother should be deprived of the blessings of Allah Almighty and Islam. This inclined the mind of Khalid bin Waleed more towards Islam and he felt very elated and proud that the Prophet(pbuh) had asked about him.During this time, he dreamt that he was moving out of a tiny, dark and dingy place into a vast green fertile field.When he woke up he felt extremely pleasant and made up his mind to go to Madinah. When Khalid bin Waleed met the Prophet(pbuh), he respectfully greeted him and was greeted back with a smile.Khalid bin Waleed then took the pledge of allegiance, swearing on the palm of the Prophet(pbuh).The Prophet(pbuh) affectionately told Khalid bin Waleed "I was sure, taking into consideration your brilliance, your wisdom and foresight that surely one day you would accept Islam as your religion".<br>  <br>  Khalid bin Waleed then requested him to pray to Allah Almighty to forgive him for all the sins he had committed with the might of his sword against Islamand for the problems he had created for the muslims. The Prophet(pbuh) assured him that all that he had done in his days of ignorance would be automatically erased. <br>  <br>  Khalid bin Waleed had converted to Islam not out of fear or greed but because he was influenced by the attractive and magnetic personality of the Prophet(pbuh). Khalid bin Waleed fought great many battles for Islam and his military abilities and strategic thinking held even the enemies in awe.He was a great commader who gave his mind, body and soul for Islam. He greatly inspired the men whom he commanded and during the Battle of Yarmook against the Romans he addressed them thus: "O Mujahideen! This is a memorable day. It is the day on which our faith will be tested and tried. Today we should avoid every kind of arrogance, pride and not contend for individual glory or egoistic bragging. O Mujahid of Islam! Fight only to gain the Goodwill of Allah Almighty.In the muslim army today there are many great generals; each of them is worthy and can be entrusted with the permanent command of this army.Today you have assigned to me this honour of commanding the muslim army.So I hope that for the honour and victory of Islam, today we will enter the battlefield as one. Allah will be our Supporter and Defender." <br>  <br>  Khalid bin Waleed had been one of the worst enemies of Islam and Allah Almighty had inclined his heart towards Islam.The Prophet(pbuh) had said: "Khalid, you are the sword of Allah Almighty which has been made to annihilate the kuffar" Thus, he came to be known as Saifullah (the Sword of Allah). <br>  <br>  When he lay on his deathbed Khalid bin Waleed wept copiously and said that he always wanted a martyr's death.There was no joint in his body which did not carry a scar of an arrow or of a stab given by the enemy's sword.He defended the Ummah the way a lion protects its cubs.On his death, his mother prayed that the Mercy of Allah should always shelter him.He had given her happiness and she prayed that he should get happiness in the Hereafter. <br>  <br>  When the body of Khalid bin Waleed was lowered into the grave, all the Companions had become silent with grief.The weeping of his horse, Ashqar, whose tears were rolling down his cheeks, broke this silence.The Companions were amazed at this expression of grief. Khalid bin Waleed(ra), the great General of Islam died in Hammas and was buried there.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=79" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules....</a>|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Lies about Khaalid ibn al-Waleed ( peace be upon him) refuted : <a href="http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/93204" rel="nofollow">http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/93204</a><br>  ___________________________|`|6Zi7cA5Paa	He is the son of "Al-Mugueerah bin Al-Waleed" the richest man in Mecca and the most famous and well renown poet during that time. Khalid was a tall man with a well built body. He was a knight and a warrior. Many people had mistaken him for "Omar bin Al-Khattab" for such close physical resemblance.<br>  <br>  Khalid embraced Islam just 3 years before the death of prophet Mohammad (pbuh). One day, the prophet (pbuh) had asked Khalid's brother "Al-Mugueerah" who was a Muslim: " Where is Khalid? he shouldn't be ignorant about Islam since he knows better !" Al-Mugueerah sent a letter to Khalid informing him what the prophet (pbuh) had said. Khalid decided to embrace Islam after all. Khalid set out to Medinna with the company of "Amro bin Al-Auss" and both embraced Islam in the presence of the prophet (pbuh). <br>  <br>  The prophet (pbuh) gave khalid the title "the Sword of Islam" or "Sayef Al-Islam". Even though Khlaid didn't participate in the early battles, but of course, the prophet (pbuh) did foresee that Khalid will fight to raise the word of Islam. The prophet's prediction concerning Khalid was right on target and after all, Khalid is the one who conquered both empires, Rome & Persia. Khalid is the one who conquered the defectors "Apostates" headed by "Musailama the liar". Kahlid is the one who opened "Bilad Ashaam" and Iraq. All this happened during the rule of "Abu-Bakr" and "Omar bin Al-Khattab".<br>  <br>  Khalid fought next to the prophet (pbuh) in several battles such as: Tabook, Hunain, & the battle of Ta'if which was a continuation for Hunain. In Hunain, the infidels have ambushed the Muslims and many of them fled away. It's said that only 12 "Sahabah" left fighting and protecting the prophet (pbuh). Meanwhile, Khalid was inside enemy lines fighting them like a lion. When Khalid heard "Al-Abbas" calling for the Muslims, Khalid pulled back and headed toward the Prophet (pbuh). Khalid, along with Omar, Ali and Abu-Bakr, fought vigorously around the prophet (pbuh). Khalid was wounded all over his body. But Khalid's ultimate Battle was, of course, the Battle of Mu'tah. The prophet (pbuh) had sent messengers to several Arabian tribes including " the tribe of Al-Talh" inviting them to Islam, all messengers got killed but one who went back to inform the prophet (pbuh). Also, the prophet (pbuh) had sent messengers to Hercules, the Roman Leader in Bilad Ashaam, but in the middle of the road the Tribe of Gassan had captured the messengers and ordered them killed. The Prophet (pbuh) vowed to punish both tribes for such heinous crimes. <br>  <br>  The prophet (pbuh) decided to send 3 Thousand men under the leadership of "Zaid bin Harithah", and if he gets killed then "Jafar bin Abi Talib", and if he gets killed then "Abdullah bin Rawaha", and if he gets killed then Muslims ought to elect their new leader. Khalid bin Al-Waleed was among the Muslims in this platoon. <br>  <br>  The Muslim army advanced until it reached the city of Ma'aan and stayed there for 2 nights. The Muslims have learned that the Arab tribes have gathered an army of 100,000 men and that Rome has sent an army of 100,000 men to aid the local Arab tribes. Two hundred Thousand men against 3 Thousand Muslims! Of course this is not a fair fight especially when the ratio is 67 to 1. But since when numbers scared Muslims! <br>  <br>  Both armies advanced and met face to face in an area called Mu'tah, currently a small city in Jordan. Both sides launched fierce attacks at each other, while in Medianna which is 500 Miles away, the prophet (pbuh) was giving an instance and live battle update to his followers. The 3 Muslim leaders got killed and the Muslims elected Khlaid to lead the army against the Roman/Arab gigantic armies. Khalid maintained the fight until night where he, using his superior war tactics, withdrew his small army and swapped the wings. Plus, he ordered few men to go behind the hills to cause rumble and dust to create illusion that Muslim backups are on the way. The following day, both armies engaged in a fiercer battle, but the Romans thought that the Muslims had received more backup, both Romans and Arabs panicked and began cowardly withdrawing from the battle field while the small and brave Muslim army on their tails. The Muslims won this amazing Battle under the great leadership of the Muslim leader "Khalid bin Al-Waleed". <br>  <br>  Battle outcome:<br>  1) Khalid broke 9 swords in his hand.<br>  2) Only "12" Muslim casualties including the 3 leaders.<br>  3) The Romans & Arabs got defeated with thousands in casualties. <br>  <br>  Khalid bin Al-Waleed died at age 55 during Omar bin Al-Khattab's command. Khalid was living in the city of Homs, in Syria. When Khalid died he left two things behind, his Horse and his Sword. Khalid was a great warrior, with or against Muslims. In fact, it's because of Khalid Muslims got defeated in the Battle of Ohud. Now we know why the prophet (pbuh) gave him the title " Sayef Al-Islam".....May Allah (swt) have great mercy on Khalid's sole and grant him Al-Firdoos.....Amee|`|p5cglKf0aa	THE SECOND<br>  <br>  And He granted besides this, a victory soon to come, states the following: for sure the Peace of Hudaybiya was apparently opposed to the interests of Islam and the Quraish were victorious to an extent, but it is giving news that in reality it would be a great victory and the key to further conquests. For although with the Peace of Hudaybiya the physical sword was temporarily hung up, the flashing diamond sword of the Qur'an was unsheathed, and it conquered minds and hearts. Through the truce, the two sides mixed with one another. The virtues of Islam and lights of the Qur'an rent the veils of obduracy and tribalism, and enacted their decrees. For example, people like Khalid b. Walid, a brilliant warrior, and Amr b. al-As, a brilliant politician, who could not accept defeat, were defeated by the Qur'anic sword manifested through the Truce of Hudaybiya. After submitting in perfect obedience to Islam in Medina, Khalid became a "Sword of Allah"; a sword in the conquests of Islam.<br>  <br>  A n I m p o r t a n t Q u e s t i o n : What was the wisdom in the defeats of the Companions of the Noble Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace), the Glory of the World and Beloved of the Sustainer of All the Worlds, against the idolators at the end of Uhud and beginning of Hunayn?<br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r : Among the idolators were many persons like Khalid who in the future would be equal to the leading Companions of that time. Therefore, so as not to degrade them entirely in the view of the future, which for them would be glorious and honourable, Divine wisdom gave them in the past immediate recompense for their future good works and did not completely destroy their pride. That is to say, the Companions of the past were defeated by the Companions of the future, so that the future Companions would enter Islam, not through fear of the flashing sword, but through zeal for the flash of truth, and so that they and their natural valour should not be brought low.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2907&t=The+Seventh+Flash" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2907&...</a>|`|FIJeBU0Vaa	Khalid bin waleed was a great sahabi .<br>  <br>  shias r as usual enemy of all muslim heroes|`|xj5DnyBzaa	Hes a Muslim hero one of the greatest Muslim mujahideens and also the greatest muslim general|`|zKQKl9mZaa	Ex-Sunni = a Christian/Jew in disguise.<br>  <br>  His other name = Osama|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Khalid ibn Walid attacked Muslims and murdered prisoners and then he took the Muslim wife of one of the Muslims on the opposing side and he raped her the same night he murdered her Muslim husband.<br>  <br>  @anotherside- once again you proved us that you are a Nasibi.<br>  <br>  You said shias are enemies of ALL MUSLIM HEROS.<br>  <br>  Shia of Ali(AS)= Friend of Ali(AS).We consider him a Muslim Hero, so a Shia cannot be an enemy of Ali(AS).<br>  <br>  so why don't you consider Ali(AS) as a Muslim Hero?, Why not Hasan(AS) as a Muslim Hero?

Truth speaks for itself.<br>  <br>  We are proud of our Early scholars; Imams of Hadith & Fiqh, who devoted their lives in search and collection of "Truth" enabling us choose the right path of Islam. This is the reason that no Sunni abuse the descendants of Ali(RA) while shia and their leaders don't have respect for the great Sahabis and friends of RasulAllah. <br>  <br>  Shi'ism has taken many twist and turn during the past 14 Centuries.<br>  <br>   Whenever they are unable to produce evidance from reliable sources; Quran, Hadith and established facts they start preaching "unity & brotherhood" and come again from a different angle! <br>  <br>  May Allah guide them,<br>  <br>  Addition: <br>  @Pedram: Brother pleased to see you here.  It is what I have been telling you in my previous posts. <br>  The above quotes from Early scholars are an eye opening fact duly acknowledged by some shia scholars! Check yr books..<br>  Brother it is no use to submit your Qummi Hadiths and additions fabricated, during Safvi Rulers, in 16th Century AD.<br>  <br>  Break your shell! <br>  Peace!|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	I wanted to add, the "Baulus" ibn Taymiyyah is referring to of Christianity is "Paul" in English. It has been said that Paul did to Christianity (by severely changing the teachings of Prophet Jesus, peace be upon him) what Ibn Saba tried to do with Islam (by inventing Shee'ism).<br>  <br>  ---<br>  The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|mVSC9aKoaa	Shia would refuse their own authentic books because it shows them mirror.

03Xx7l8Baa	The two most common you'll find for ayat are;<br>  -- cool ;)<br>  Al Ahzab (33;59)<br>  ??? ???????? ?????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????? ??? ?????????????? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ???? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ?????????<br>  <br>  -- surah al-ahzab (33) verse 59;<br>  O Prophet! Enjoin on your wives, daughters, and the believing women that they should DRAW their outer garment over their persons. That is more proper, so that they may be recognized and not bothered. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br>  <br>  The arabic word used here is yodneen. ????? meaning to bring over or pull down. * We know that women at that time already wore the head scarf and covered their hair. Only the slaves didn't cover their hair, so women differentiated themselves from the slaves by covering their hair. So this verse is telling them to draw that scarf to be over them.<br>  <br>  --basically if your interested in the arabic wording;<br>  ?????? ya ayuha ('O)<br>  an nabbio (Prophet) ?????<br>  ?? qol (say)<br>  ? le (to)<br>  ?????? azwajeka (wives)<br>  wa (and) ?<br>  banateka (daughters) ????<br>  wa (and)?<br>  ???? nasaa'e (women)<br>  al mu'meneen (the believing) ????????<br>  yudneen (draw, pull, bring down) ?? ???<br>  alayhenna (alay = preposition on, henna pronoun for her) ?????<br>  min (from) ??<br>  ??? ????? jalabeybehenna (jalabey - loose dress, henna pronoun for her)<br>  <br>  Surah Nur (24;31)<br>  ????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ??? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????? ????? ???????????? ???? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????????? ???? ??????????? ???? ????? ?????????????? ???? ?????????????? ???? ???????? ?????????????? ???? ?????????????? ???? ????? ?????????????? ???? ????? ?????????????? ???? ???????????? ???? ??? ???????? ?????????????? ???? ????????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ???? ?????????? ???? ????????? ????????? ???? ?????????? ????? ????????? ????????? ???? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ??? ???????????? ????????? ????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????????? ???????????<br>  <br>  ...also in surah nur (24) verse 31;<br>  Enjoin the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty; not to display their beauty and ornaments except what normally appears thereof;let them DRAW their veils OVER their bosoms and not display their charms except to their husbands, their fathers, their fathers-in-law, their own sons, their stepsons, their own brothers, their nephews on either brother's or sister's sides, their own womenfolk, their own slaves, male attendants who lack sexual desires or small children who have no carnal knowledge of women. Also enjoin on them not to strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden trinkets. And O believers! Turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, so that you may attain salvation.<br>  ___________________________<br>  As for the hadiths there are plenty too... common ones r;<br>      * ?ā'isha reported that Muhammad's wives went out at night-time to open fields in the outskirts of Medina to relieve themselves. Umar said "Muhammad, ask your ladies to observe veil." Sahih al-Bukhari 1:4:148<br>      * Narrated Anas ibn Malik: "I know (about) the Hijab (the order of veiling of women) more than anybody else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to ask me about it. Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle remained sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." Sahih al-Bukhari 7:65:375, Sahih Muslim 8:3334<br>      * Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: "The Prophet said: Allah does not accept the prayer of a woman who has reached puberty unless she wears a veil." Sunnan Abu Dawud 2:641. Abū Dawud is considered the third most authentic collection (after Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). However, not all hadiths in Abu Dawud are authentic.<br>      * Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: "Asma bint Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah while she was wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma', when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands." Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4092. The collector, Abū Dawud, considered this hadith weak. Some later scholars have disagreed with Abū Dawud.<br>      * Narrated Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya, Ummul Mu'minin: "When the verse 'That they should cast their outer garments over their persons' was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows over their heads by wearing outer garments." Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4090. Abū Dawud classed this hadith as authentic.<br>      * Narrated Safiya bint Shaiba: "Aisha used to say: 'When (the Verse): "They should draw their veils over their necks and bosoms," was revealed, (the ladies) cut their waist sheets at the edges and covered their faces with the cut pieces.'" Sahih al-Bukhari 6:60:282, Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4091.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Just wear it if you are convinced,   don't question sheep never ask "why"|`|Spixxn8Gaa	Yes

UWlRLXvRaa	It means to wound Him and cause Him sadness. He loves us more than we love ourselves and He has given Himself totally to us and expects that we give ourselves totally to Him. This may sound spooky to some for they tend to view Him more as a force rather than a person or being. He is a real being and He is present. <br>  <br>  An object or force like the wind can't be grieved. Only those who love can be grieved. Only those who have made themselves vulnerable to others can be hurt. And according to this scripture we can grieve the Holy Spirit because He loves us and made Himself vulneralbe to us. (Meditate on that for a while!)<br>  <br>  When we walk in the ways of the world we are walking out of step with the Holy Spirit and it grieves Him. He was sent to guide us into the truth and way of the Christ which always leads to life. He's here to help us and we need Him. When we choose to walk on the "wide road" instead of dancing with Him (following His lead like a dancing partner follows the lead of their partner) on the narrow road, we grieve Him. Not only because we're rejecting Him but He's also greived at what we will reap when we sin. He hates to see us participating with things that lead to death. Jesus shed His blood that we might walkin love and life and righteousness now. The Holy Spirit came to help us do just that so when we sin we're rejecting both Him and we're diminishing the precious blood of Christ. It's no wonder the Holy Spirit is grieved!<br>  <br>  He's here to make the gospel real and make the promise of Jesus giving us abundant life a reality in our hearts. Sin, makes death abundant in our lives and hurts us. And that hurts Him as well for like I said, He loves us dearly!<br>   <br>  We are to give ourselves to the Holy Spirit and not to pleasure. Pleasure has it's place but the world has made a god of it. The Holy Spirit is our God along with the Father and the Son. They are our joy. That's why Paul said to "be filled with the Spirit" and not to get drunk on wine. We find our life (zoe) from God while the world looks to temporary pleasures of life (bios) for happiness. It's no wonder they are always unhappy and needing more! The Holy Spirit produces His fruit (Gal. 5:22) which remains even in the midst of trials and problems and things we wish would "unhappen".<br>  <br>  But we are to be sensative to the Holy Spirit.

So we ought to avoid being in the flesh  :)  Let the power of the Holy Spirit overpower the sinful flesh, so we are doing those things that are right  :)  Use His power to do that.  Because we can't stop our flesh without Him.

TfOfVRYnaa	French was an official language of England for 600 years. 40% of English words are derived from french words.|`|IU2Znlv3aa	No, I'm english and started learning french when i was about 5. Although the adjective/noun order is a bit different, it really isn't hard at all to get your head around. The word order for french is very very similar to that of english (eg the verbs) and, unlike spanish they use je/tu/il,elle,on etc before the verb, which makes a bit more sense to an english speaker; in spanish you don't need to pu yo/tu/el/ella etc before the verb (that's how we are taught in the UK, I'm aware that in the states they are taught to use yo etc before the verb).<br>  With chinese, as far as i am aware, there aren't tenses, which i find hard to get my head round, and (if it's anything like japanese) where the verb is in the sentence is very different.<br>  Also the vocabulary in french is similar to english - you can often guess what a french word is in english, because both languages are latin based, and there are quite a few french phrases used in english, where as chinese words are so completely different to english they can be hard to learn, as you have nothing to associate them with.<br>  for example:<br>  Cat - chat (in french) and mao (in chinese)|`|AA12018110	English and Mandarin aren't really similar at all.

Skin color was used to establish superiority. The “White” race was defined as “superior” and the “Black” race was “inferior” along with the Asians who were labelled “Yellow” <br>  <br>  Later they coined more scientific terms: Caucasoid (White), Negro?d (Black), Mongoloid (Yellow). <br>  <br>  Once they encountered Native Americans they used the color “Red“. Once again based on visual observation such as skin color, hair (or lack of) and eye shape, Native Americans were categorized a Mongoloid. <br>  <br>  Today DNA clearly shows that they are not. Scientists are still trying to get their heads around that one. One hypothesis is, Native American represent a pre-Asian population.<br>  <br>  All through the ages, “White” has been viewed as “superior” and the “Coloreds” “inferior”. <br>  <br>  The belief that all other races are “inferior” has been the basis of most of the atrocities committed worldwide.<br>  <br>  Scientific racism<br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/scientific-racism" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/scientific-...</a><br>  <br>  eugenics<br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/eugenics" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/eugenics</a><br>  ================<br>  <br>  Well you asked so I just reported what is (or should be) common knowledge.<br>  <br>  The last time I outlined the this same information, I was reported for being disrespectful to community members.

pfke6Jieaa	are you half asian as in indian or east asian? u know what. this seems to be a controversial issue at these days i have no idea why. i found some interesting articles last time about an interview with white and black men also and they mostly prefer eastern asian over other woman. the reason is, submissive, caring, less complaining, etc.<br>  <br>  i find my self attracted to an attractive person. and i can tell u there are many attractive girls from every race that i encounter, not just asian females. but i think white men started to like asian women during the colonization times. and the same happened with asian women they started preferring white men. its not a new thing its been going on for years.<br>  <br>  i spent 1 year in japan and a month in korea and most of the sailors that went out to bars and had japanese and korean gfs were white mostly and then blacks and hispanic. i had a long job so i had to work more than 8 hours everyday i never went out with any japanese girls, but it seemed to other sailors that im not really attracted to them. im attracted to them but i just treat everyone the same. i dont go crazy for any girl, only the one i love thats it. <br>  <br>  but trust me i talked to a lot of european men who despise asian women and say nasty things about them. so not all white men prefer them. but i never really heard any asian women say they are not attracted to white men or say something bad about them. i think if they like each other let them hook up. as long as its for the right reasons.<br>  <br>  EDIT: he girl above me, ur opinion is not good at all. u seem to be brainwashed with the media. our women also take care of their bodies and they shower everyday. i dont think they are competing for white men as they tend to find our men more attractive. u dont have to say those things about other races cuz most of them stick to their own.<br>  <br>  i dont like the way u put the last sentence the first thing that came to my mind was americanized. its only white men that prefer them, not other races trust me.<br>  <br>  @asker, most middle eastern and indian women despise white guys so thats why there is no relationship between them. im sorry but that is what they say, but not all. i know a lot of white guys want date them but they dont open up like east asian. it took me also a while to accept dating a filipina. our culture is just very homogenous. they dont like mixing.<br>  <br>  i forgot to mention asian women are smaller than middle eastern women so a non asian guy looks huge to them. most middle eastern women are tall so it would make the man kinda less masculine in his mind at least. asian women are usually around 5 ft or so.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	they are small and shapeless and a lot of white guys like that. have you ever heard of that weird saying 'me big strong american man'?- that's what they like to say to east asians. it wouldn't work so well with amazonian indian or malaysian women.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	Because the Chinese/Japanese look has been glamorized by the media.

I don't find a lot of caucasian men or black men dating western asian women/middle easterns! Maybe becuase of the cultures... I would say eastern/southeastern asians tend to be more opened..some are shy, but some are very outgoing...plus, i heard some people say the eastern asians (jap, korean, chinese, etc) tend to appear in p*rns and whatnot; that could be one of the reasons why! Well my bf who happens to be white dates me for the first time who happens to be an asian (chinese). He doesn't like blondes, even tho he's a blonde, and he's into the asian eyes (chinky), the skin, the hair, the dark-brown eye color, as well as the petite body! And i believe eastern asians women tend to take care of themselves better than the other ones...we are less hairy and shower everyday, so there you go.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	I am  married to a filipina who definitely is malay in appearance and I prefer her to every other woman.<br>  My ex was indian btw.<br>  No one of them are skinny and shapeless
gmaCvh00aa	Maybe you just wish the need for a separate Black culture didn't exist.<br>  <br>  Although the indigenous people of this continent are technically the first or "true" Americans, (which to me is kind of an awkward term since America wasn't a term for these continents until Europeans came around), I'd say that Black American culture is the only true United States-born culture in that it was formed out of this young country's history parallel to what the voluntarily immigrant groups experienced.  There is some remnant of African culture in the music and worship styles, but for the most part Black Americans created their forms of religion, cuisine, and music out of their survival abilities under some of the worst conditions imaginable.  Even after the 13th Amendment, they weren't allowed to play with us in the sandbox so they made their own sandbox and now that we've decided that they are acceptable to play with, do we expect them to close up their special sandbox and come running over to us?<br>  <br>  I don't think you are a racist in any way other than the way most of us white people are--we can't pretend to understand the African-American experience, we can only resolve to learn about it so that when our paths cross with individuals of another culture, we understand them a little better.  Knowledge is power for everyone.|`|8fyEZtyNaa	people still wear fubu??? people watch bet???? as for black history month, well we wouldnt need that if schools would change their curriculum and teach about other contributions in history. as for al sharpton, i dont really care for him.<br>  <br>  i dont think  you hate the people, you just hate the concept.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	This is a tempest in a teapot.

If you don't have that standard then there is no standard, because no other religion offers a way to God.  All other religions tell us to be a good person....but by who's standards?

You might be moral out of fear, or unthinkingly, through conditioning.<br>  <br>  Morality is for people who cannot be trusted to understand what is good or evil, on their own.  Morals are a social short cut.  Morality is ethics for dummies.  <br>  <br>  Everyone's goal should be to outgrow morals supplied by their parents when they were immature, by understanding, on a deeper level, why some actions are good and why some other actions are bad, and that the details of the situation shifts the boundaries all the time.

It's just a question of what the text is saying and in what context.  There are multiple interpretations of what many scriptures mean, even in the most literal context.<br>  <br>  For example, many Christians believe the earth is less than 7,000 years old because their literal reading of Genesis tells them so.  But my literal reading of Genesis tells me that the earth is millions of years old.  My reading is no less literal than the other, but the interpretation is very different.<br>  <br>  There are also Christians who believe the text says one thing, but they just choose to ignor it, of course.|`|EBXvl6Foaa	If you dont believe what the Bible teaches, than you are not a Christian. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if that was the answer you were looking for.

AA11648578	Mohammedan, the term is now largely superseded by Muslim, Moslem or Islamic, but was commonly used in Western literature until at least the mid-1960s. Same thing.|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  Mohammedans is a false term that the old christians use to call Muslims.<br>  <br>  1.   Islam means peace.<br>  <br>  Islam comes from the root word ‘salaam’, which means peace. It also means submitting one’s will to Allah (swt). Thus Islam is a religion of peace, which is acquired by submitting one’s will to the will of the Supreme Creator, Allah (swt).<br>  <br>  2.   Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace.<br>  <br>  Each and every human being in this world is not in favour of maintaining peace and harmony. There are many, who would disrupt it for their own vested interests. Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace. It is precisely for this reason that we have the police who use force against criminals and anti-social elements to maintain peace in the country. Islam promotes peace. At the same time, Islam exhorts it followers to fight where there is oppression. The fight against oppression may, at times, require the use of force. In Islam force can only be used to promote peace and justice.<br>  <br>  3.   Opinion of historian De Lacy O’Leary.<br>  <br>  The best reply to the misconception that Islam was spread by the sword is given by the noted historian De Lacy O’Leary in the book "Islam at the cross road" (Page 8):<br>  <br>  "History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myth that historians have ever repeated."<br>  <br>  4.   Muslims ruled Spain for 800 years.<br>  <br>  Muslims ruled Spain for about 800 years. The Muslims in Spain never used the sword to force the people to convert. Later the Christian Crusaders came to Spain and wiped out the Muslims. There was not a single Muslim in Spain who could openly give the adhan, that is the call for prayers.<br>  <br>  5.   14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians.<br>  <br>  Muslims were the lords of Arabia for 1400 years. For a few years the British ruled, and for a few years the French ruled. Overall, the Muslims ruled Arabia for 1400 years. Yet today, there are 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christians i.e. Christians since generations. If the Muslims had used the sword there would not have been a single Arab who would have remained a Christian.<br>  <br>  6.   More than 80% non-Muslims in India.<br>  <br>  The Muslims ruled India for about a thousand years. If they wanted, they had the power of converting each and every non-Muslim of India to Islam. Today more than 80% of the population of India are non-Muslims. All these non-Muslim Indians are bearing witness today that Islam was not spread by the sword.<br>  <br>  7.   Indonesia and Malaysia.<br>  <br>  Indonesia is a country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the world. The majority of people in Malaysia are Muslims. May one ask, "Which Muslim army went to Indonesia and Malaysia?"<br>  <br>  8.   East Coast of Africa.<br>  <br>  Similarly, Islam has spread rapidly on the East Coast of Africa. One may again ask, if Islam was spread by the sword, "Which Muslim army went to the East Coast of Africa?"<br>  <br>  9.   Thomas Carlyle.<br>  <br>  The famous historian, Thomas Carlyle, in his book "Heroes and Hero worship", refers to this misconception about the spread of Islam: "The sword indeed, but where will you get your sword? Every new opinion, at its starting is precisely in a minority of one. In one man’s head alone. There it dwells as yet. One man alone of the whole world believes it, there is one man against all men. That he takes a sword and try to propagate with that, will do little for him. You must get your sword! On the whole, a thing will propagate itself as it can."<br>  <br>  10.   No compulsion in religion.<br>  <br>  With which sword was Islam spread? Even if Muslims had it they could not use it to spread Islam because the Qur’an says in the following verse: <br>  <br>  "Let there be no compulsion in religion: <br>  Truth stands out clear from error"[Al-Qur’an 2:256]<br>  <br>  11.   Sword of the Intellect.<br>  <br>  It is the sword of intellect. The sword that conquers the hearts and minds of people. The Qur’an says in Surah Nahl, chapter 16 verse 125:<br>  <br>  "Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord<br>  with wisdom and beautiful preaching;<br>  and argue with them in ways that are<br>  best and most gracious."   [Al-Qur’an 16:125]<br>  <br>  12.   Increase in the world religions from 1934 to 1984.<br>  <br>  An article in Reader’s Digest ‘Almanac’, year book 1986, gave the statistics of the increase of percentage of the major religions of the world in half a century from 1934 to 1984. This article also appeared in ‘The Plain Truth’ magazine. At the top was Islam, which increased by 235%, and Christianity had increased only by 47%. May one ask, which war took place in this century which converted millions of people to Islam?<br>  <br>  13.   Islam is the fastest growing religion in America and Europe.<br>  <br>  Today the fastest growing religion in America is Islam. The fastest growing religion in Europe in Islam. Which sword is forcing people in the West to accept Islam in such large numbers?<br>  <br>  14.   Dr. Joseph Adam Pearson.<br>  <br>  Dr. Joseph Adam Pearson rightly says, "People who worry that nuclear weaponry will one day fall in the hands of the Arabs, fail to realize that the Islamic bomb has been dropped already, it fell the day MUHAMMED (pbuh) was born".<br>  <br>  Peace|`|a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	"Mohammedanism" is what Christians used to call Islam, but the term is wrong.<br>  <br>  In Islam, Mohammed is considered the last and greatest prophet, but he is not seen as divine, for there is no god but Allah.  "Islam" meaning "submission" is the proper name of the religion; the name "Mohammedanism" implies that Muslims worship Mohammed, which in Islamic terms would be blasphemy.<br>  <br>  At least that's my impression as a non-Muslim who has read a little about the religion.<br>  <br>  You write about Islam spreading "by the use of force and sword," and as a non-Muslim, I worry about that, too.  <br>  <br>  OTOH - Isn't it also true that Christianity has spread a great deal through the use of military force, despite the fact that Christianity is supposedly a religion of peace? <br>  <br>  I certainly don't want or intend to be converted to Islam by force.  But I wonder if Islam's history on this point is much worse than than of several other religions.  <br>  <br>  Between roughly 700 and 1550 AD, for example, Islam spread a great deal by means of conquest, and threatened or actually conquered several Christian societies.  <br>  <br>  But since roughly 1492, hasn't it been Christian societies, mostly European ones, who have been the most responsible for trying to conquer and convert the world by means of military might?  <br>  <br>  Think of imperial Spain, the Dutch and Portuguese Empires, and the French and British Empires in Asia and North America.   <br>  <br>  Think also of the United States and the "little wars" and CIA dirty tricks that our country has waged since the 1890s in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. <br>  <br>  Is there any MODERN Muslim society that can match this historical record of war-making and imperial conquest?  <br>  <br>  Has modern Iran, for instance, ever overthrown a democratically elected American government, the way the American CIA in 1953 succeeded in toppling the elected Iranian government of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh? <br>  <br>  Has modern Iraq ever invaded and occupied any part of the United States, the way that the United States has waged two major wars against the Iraqis since 1990?<br>  <br>  Has Lebanon ever dispatched its Marines to Washington, D.C., the way the United States government has sometimes dispatched the U.S. Marines to Beirut?<br>  <br>  Has Afghanistan ever dispatched thousands of troops to the United States, in order to topple one US government and install another, the way that the United States has done in Afghanistan?<br>  <br>  Not trying to apologize for Islamist terrorism here.  Not at all.  But it's interesting to put things in perspective.|`|JlNolovdaa	Islam was not spread by d sword, d sword was only used in defense.<br>  rather, Islam was spread by Aqhlaaq ( manners/behavior )<br>  If u wanna kno more abt Islam log on to www.islamcity.com|`|MVvxfEIzaa	no islam is islam <br>  <br>  there is a movie called (al risala) or (the messege) it tells the story about mohammad and islam !

She obviously didn't have any self control and she did harm to someone else because she didn't have any boundaries as it relates to her and drinking.  However, you can't generalize women based on this incident.  Yes many women have issues but not all of them. Those women like the one in the story lack self respect, and self control.  She didn't keep herself together and she allowed her drunkenness to get out of control.. So really it was her issue that caused this.|`|rsdKX1fyaa	Judging by the state of the ugly old boiler who bit it off, she probably thought he had a half-chewed kebab in his gob, and she was trying to scoff it.|`|1T8kOC1waa	She is only one woman and cannot be held as representative for the female demographic, however yes, mental.<br>  <br>  I need a Big Mac.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	women are unkind unfeeling people.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	It's a fella in drag - whatever it is it's bonkers!|`|B3cPFhssaa	Look at the picture of the so called "Woman."<br>  Are we,in all honesty,100% certain that this is not in fact Ronald McDonalds brother?<br>  I have my doubts.|`|gebIjqnWaa	Women control most of the money in the U.S. They marry into it.

ewWUFWyWaa	There is a much greater lesson in the stories of stoning in the Bible than the Christians are willing to admit!<br>  <br>  In fundamental Christian Theology NOBODY, BUT NOBODY BEATS THE ABORTION CLINICS IN SENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF SOULS OF THE UNBORN TO BE WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST FOR EVER AND EVER IN HEAVEN!!! So why are the Christians so noxious against the abortionists and hate them so much when they are doing a much better job sending souls to Heaven than ALL THE CHURCH MISSIONARIES AND PREACHERS PUT TOGUETHER…!!!??? …unless it is sheer Christian envy that is characteristic of low IQ religious fanatics!!!<br>  <br>  What is more important? To allow the soul of a fetus to go to Heaven through a NECESSARY ABORTION for whatever reason or to let it be born and grow past the age of accountability and never becoming a Christian of the right brand so he/she can go to Heaven to be with Jesus…?<br>  <br>  Take this real Bible scenario in God's HELL of a mother and her son or daughter being tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric fire when back on Earth the MOTHER WAS PLANNING TO ABORT HER CHILD.  If she would have done so the child fetus would be in HEAVEN now with JESUS for ever and ever, but instead mother and son or daughter are sizzling in HELL together because some Christian Fundies were picketing the abortion clinics and forced the mother to change her mind!!!     <br>  <br>  In fundamental Christian Theology THEY HAVE THE POWER TO SEND SOULS TO HEAVEN GUARANTEED THROUGH ABORTION…!!! <br>   <br>  …OR…<br>  <br>  THEY CAN LET THE SAME SOULS HAVE A CHANCE AT A LIVE BIRTH and give them an opportunity to believe in the claims of Jesus Christ as soon as they pass the age of accountability… that is, if they are lucky enough to be in the right place and at the right time to hear what the Bible writers say about Jesus Christ’s claims...  failure to do so will guarantee them to go to be tormented for ever and ever in Hell…!!!<br>  <br>  How can a Christian be happy in Heaven looking at the many fetuses of unborn children from mothers who are now in HELL?  The fetuses were lucky enough to have been aborted at the right time and they are in Heaven, but their mothers are now in HELL because they never accepted Jesus Christ as a personal Savior, either…!  BTW, most of the fetuses in Heaven will come from Red China where abortion is mandatory by law under certain conditions… Can you imagine American Christians in Heaven surrounded by the souls of billions of aborted Chinese fetuses? They are all enjoying watching the souls of NON-ABORTED fetuses of grown up Americans sizzling in HELL.  All because some evil minded Christian clergy refused their mothers a needed abortion for whatever reason.  So they were set up to go to Hell as soon as they grow up past the age of accountability without believing in the right Christian brand! <br>  <br>  If you have the patience of reading Numbers 5:11-31 with all the foot notes you will discover that God is in the BUSINESS of making life miserable for the ladies any lady and at the same time he is in the abortion business, too… strictly for MONEY for the priests! This portion of Holy Scripture is so sickening that it is totally ignored by most members of the Clergy and preachers… In essence, the wife of a jealous husband is forced “to appear before the LORD” and drink about half a gallon of a sickening concoction brewed by the priest and made of dirt taken from the soil around the altar of the LORD that will cause the “womb to swell and the thigh* (*fetus) to fall away”…<br>  <br>  Numbers 5:22 (NIV) May this water that brings a curse enter your BODY SO THAT YOUR ABDOMEN SWELLS AND YOUR THIGH WASTES AWAY.[fn5]  Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be it.”* (*Yeah… you better say it loud and clear so we can all hear ya!!!)<br>  [fn5] or… BODY AND CAUSE YOU TO BE BARREN AND HAVE A MISCARRYING WOMB* (*either one of the 2 translations is OK)<br>  <br>  If God makes the woman to survive the fetus toxic test without anything falling away from her womb then she is innocent of “suspicion of adultery,” but if the pregnant woman aborts the fetus then her husband is COMPLETELY CLEAN OF ANY WRONGDOING! And she is stoned to death for adultery!!!  This is the Holy Bible way of doing away with adulterous wives! BTW… notice that you need to bring MONEY to the PRIEST every time that you want to perform this test on your wife!!! The “never changing” Bible God wants you to perform this test on your wife ANYTIME YOU FEEL JEALOUS…!!! Biblically speaking, JEALOUSY is a VALID REASON for a FORCED ABORTION!!! No other Heathen God today is as primitive and uncivilized as the Bible God! And the Christian ladies go crazy for it!  The Bible is so full of crap that it is no joke! Christians are imposing their evil pro-life based ONLY ON THEIR SADISTIC CHURCH DOGMAS! Saint Joseph should have taken his young virgin fiancé the Blessed Virgin Mary to have this Bible test done on her!  The sucker didn’t do it and now the world is stuck with Christianity!|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I believe that you should DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU...

That was how Paul reapplied the command to "purge the evil from among you" in 1 Corinthians 5, so there's a very early Christian precedent for not using the same punishments.|`|G9VOOzS9aa	So, everything you have pointed to is from the 'old covenant', or in other words- the old contract with God. You ARE aware, aren't you, that the 'new covenant', or contract, completely wiped out the old one, right? That means that these 'old' rules do not apply. Basically, stoning was outlawed about 2,000 years ago, dude. If you can't find it in the New Testament, where Jesus described everything pertaining to the new contract, then it doesn't apply.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "newly born", I hate to tell you this, but your very strenuous attempt to use many words to form the appearance of intelligence has failed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Lol- So, you went through and thumbs-downed anyone who pointed to the truth of the matter. Why? Because you disagree? You cannot use the Bible as a reference for a question without accepting the Bible as evidence of a true answer to your question. Jesus himself said that he was evidence of a new covenant or contract and that the 'old things were washed away'. You got the answer you asked for, we can't help it if you refuse to accept it. Oh, and by the way- to quote Jesus is not slander against him.  Typical non-believer...|`|NsHV4O8oaa	Blood is correct - that is part of the Jewish law which was obsoleted by Jesus when he died<br>  people really get bogged down with things that aren't necessary - Jesus on several occasions forgave people, one who was an adulteress<br>  (that would be the 'let the one who is sinless cast the first stone' but i'm not sure if thats an authorative scripture...)<br>  you have to understand the christian system was to replace the Jewish system of the time - and a new way a life was introduced<br>  God had cleansed the unclean things, for example and circumcision was no longer necessary|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	Don't you know that when Jesus died that he did away with the laws of man(Hebrew + mosaic law). We are to follow the law of the ten commandments that Jesus followed as well. Don't you remember when the high priest brought the woman in who committed adultery? Jesus said,"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone at her." So that doctrine in itself should let you know that it is not for man to judge mans lawlessness according to the law of God but its God's authority that will judge lawlessness according to the 10 commandments. If any man should judge you no matter what you do, then cursed is that man or woman because it's God's possession of judgement that we all have to face on that great day. All we have to do today is just turn all our ways to God and repent and love our fellow man and follow His commandments and spread the word and we will definitely be favored by God. Ignore those who judge you because there is only one that can judge you and that is the CREATOR.|`|rIvp1BToaa	Jesus forgave  the adulterous  woman and that is  what we should  follow  but  we should  not commit adultery  any way.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone'...Jesus|`|j5YwuVEIaa	STONING<br>  Under the Law, a wrongdoer deserving capital punishment usually was pelted to death with stones. (Le 20:2) This was to ‘clear out what was bad from their midst.’ All Israel would hear of the punishment, and fear of such wrongdoing would be instilled in their hearts. (De 13:5, 10,?11; 22:22-24) In stoning an evildoer, they showed that they were zealous for true worship, anxious to see that no reproach came upon God’s name, and desirous of maintaining a clean congregation.<br>  Before a wrongdoer could be stoned, at least two witnesses had to give harmonious testimony against him, and thereafter they cast the first stones. (Le 24:14; De 17:6,?7) The prospect of being the executioner made a person think searchingly in giving evidence and doubtless was a deterrent to false testimony, which, if discovered, would cost the lying witness his own life.—De 19:18-20.<br>  Stoning no doubt usually took place outside the city. (Nu 15:35,?36; 1Ki 21:13; contrast De 22:21.) Thereafter, as a warning, the corpse might be impaled on a stake, but not beyond sunset. It was buried that same day.—De 21:21-23.<br>  Jesus spoke of Jerusalem as “the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her.” (Mt 23:37; compare Heb 11:37.) Christ himself was threatened with stoning. (Joh 8:59; 10:31-39; 11:8) Stephen was killed in this manner. (Ac 7:58-60) At Lystra fanatical Jews “stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining he was dead.”—Ac 14:19; compare 2Co 11:25.

For not being a Christian, it seem you have better insight than some who claim to be.<br>  <br>  Yes, we forgive - that means, like Jesus did for us, we are clean.  This guy should be having people coming to him to encourage him to be closer to Christ - thus, if he remains in Christ, he will not fall.<br>  <br>  Because they do not embrace him, they will also be held accountable.<br>  <br>  It is true, one needs to be careful with such people, but to make him an outcast when he is trying to repent and change his ways, they hinder it by refusing him.

La is an article therefore it follows the noun, and the function of ils, which may confuse you because it is masculine, is the subject of the sentence.

Affixing la to a verb (regardent) is an error.<br>  <br>  If you're studying French, it's good to learn the la/le with the noun to avoid confusion. There are a lot of rules regarding gender, but most of them have exceptions which may further confuse you. From my experience, words with -e are feminine (the suffix -e is often added to words to 'feminize' them, i.e. etudiant - etudiante).|`|gb9REJN4aa	There is no clue in the word to tell you. However, in this example, you know to use "la" and not "le" because "la" refers to "la tele." The second sentence means "They do not watch it." So the question is, what is "it?" If the thing you are referring to is feminine, then use "la." If it is masculine, use "le."

Bb6fQtl0aa	The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|RVWyPicKaa	I agree with you. I just wish this could all stop.|`|2TGSjrxPaa	Jazakallah Khair. Truly the words of Muhammad (saw) would effect the heart of a Muslim as to change his ways.

This division is so awful that sadly we see some amongst them killing each other, showing tremendous hatred and disrespect to each other and further continuing the unwelcome disunity in our Ummah. What really hurts me is that some Muslims feel they have absolute authority on declaring Shia's as kuffaar, this is wrong as I have always felt that as long as a person meets the primary criteria as laid out in our Glorious Quran for being a Muslim, that person is a Muslim. The primary criteria or beliefs being that they affirm that there is no God but Allah, that our beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the final messenger of Allah and that our Glorious Quran is the final revelation of Allah and that what it says is the truth than that person whether Shia, Sunni, Sufi is a Muslim, this person has met the primary criteria and as such is our Muslim brother, however this person will have secondary views and these views will often differ amongst the various "sects"in Islam and sometimes these secondary views might be very unpleasant and disconcerting which Allah ultimately has the right to judge the seriousness of this view, in a case like this we could say this person might be committing a sin, how major a sin this is, is for Allah to ultimately judge but certainly as long as this person still has his primary belief structure intact, he is still within the fold of Islam, yes he might be committing a major sin but I have never seen anybody thrown out of the fold of Islam for committing a major sin unless that sin is shirk or is against the primary criteria for being a Muslim, so as such, such a person is still a Muslim though he may be committing a major sin upon which Allah has the right to determine the level of punishment such a person deserves and don't forget that Allah's doors of mercy and forgiveness are always open to us Muslims whether we be Sunni, Shia, Sufi (all these are just titles by the way) etc which leads me to my next point that as Muslims we should all engage in a sincere effort to help one another in resolving these deviances so as to sincerely refrain from committing sin as a result of what could be a serious wrong view due to these deviances. I feel that in the interest of seeking truth and reconciliation, there should be a determined effort to promote many dialogues, discussion and research between both Sunni and Shia scholars and any other Muslim (primary criteria - so no Qadianis, Aga Khan Ismailis etc) groups scholars. These discussions should be such that the differing viewpoints should be honestly presented, there should be a critical, sincere and honest analysis of the sources and narrations that provide the basis for such differing views, the historical authenticity of these sources should also be verified and ultimately the aim of such symposia and gatherings should be to bring about reconciliation in the Ummah through honest and sincere analysis of what's causing the split. Obviously this might not bring about total reconciliation and many might still subscribe to their original secondary views but at least now a sincere and truthful effort has been made to iron out the differences and at least the hatred should be encouraged to stop. After all British and Germans still strongly disagree over World War 2 but do you see them at each others throats, instead you see them ideologically recognising and embracing one another despite their strong historical differences. The streets of Berlin and London are peaceful unlike the streets of Baghdad (though that is also due to the US invasion but the sectarian violence was uncalled for). Allah the Exalted, the Wise tells us all in our Glorious Quran to hold on fast to His rope and stay united and that ultimately He is the judge and He will show us where we have gone wrong on the Day of Qiyammah and as I would understand it Him showing us where we may have deviated is not Him discarding or rejecting us and our sincere, honest effort for true belief <br>  <br>  Salaam to all|`|6jCe21Plaa	Thank You For Your Advice.ill will stay away from the frame of hatred.

Reword your sentence to:<br>  <br>  I live in a place where I can see high mountains from my bedroom window/front yard/back yard/driveway, etc.<br>  <br>  Will I be Arrested if I End a<br>  Sentence with a Preposition?<br>  <br>  A Southerner stopped a stranger on the Harvard campus and asked, "Could you please tell me where the library is at?" The stranger responded, "Educated people never end their sentences with a preposition." The overly polite Southerner then apologetically repeated himself: "Could you please tell me where the library is at, you jerk?"<br>  <br>  While editing the proof of one of his books, Winston Churchill spotted a sentence that had been clumsily rewritten by the editor to eliminate a preposition at the end. The elder statesman mocked the intention with a comment in the margin: "This is the sort of English up with which I will not put."<br>  These two anecdotes reflect an intolerance on both sides of the Atlantic for the rule prohibiting sentence-final prepositions. So where did the rule come from, anyway?<br>  <br>  Before the science of language, linguistics, schools and universities taught what is known as 'prescriptive grammar'. Prescriptive grammar is not grammar (the rules of spoken language) at all but a list of "do's and don'ts" prescribing the way those in or striving for the upper class should talk. Because all upper-class private schools of the time emphasized, if not required Latin, 'good' grammar was presumed to be grammar that emulated Latin grammar.<br>  <br>  The problem is, English is not Latin, an insight lost on prescriptivists. Latin has cases and every Latin preposition is associated with a case. For example, the word for "wine" in Latin is vinum. However, the prepositional phrase corresponding to "in wine" is in vino (as in 'in vino veritas'; 'wine brings out the truth') ending on the Ablative case marker, -o, because in was associated with the Ablative case. So the suffix of vin-o identifies the noun vin-um as the object of the preposition in and not the object of any other preposition in the sentence; in short, they go together.<br>  <br>  Because sentences usually contain several prepositional phrases like this (e.g., "A relative of the fruitfly was doing something like the backstroke in the wine on the table in the library."), it is important to keep up with which noun goes with which preposition. The easiest way to do that is by a rule that prepositions are never separated from their object noun (or noun phrase if the noun is modified by adjectives). Latin has that rule.<br>  <br>  Believing that Latin grammar represents grammatical perfection and unintimidated by the onerous task of molding English in the image of Latin, prescriptive grammarians proscribed the use of prepositions anywhere other than immediately before their object noun. For example, one should not say "the prescriptivist John clashed with," but rather "the prescriptivist with whom John clashed", not "the rule John laughed at," but "the rule at which John laughed".<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is, however, English simply does not have case endings on nouns that are objects of prepositions, so the reason for keeping prepositions and their object nouns together is wholly irrelevant to English. You may keep them together or not. You'll never spend a night in jail either way. However, because of the upper-class bias in the rule's history, its use now makes you sound pretentious: "the chap in whom I invested my trust". (Is that you? It isn't me; nor was it Winston Churchill.)<br>  <br>  This example teaches us two important lessons about language. First, each and every language has its own set of grammatical rules and everyone who speaks that language knows what they are in his or her region. (They do vary slightly from region to region--big deal.) That is what speech is: the use of grammatical rules to express oneself. Second, prescriptive grammar is based on misconceptions about language and causes far more mischief than good.<br>  <br>  Better to stick with the linguists.|`|t9XVzeRMaa	"I live in a place from which you can see high mountains."<br>  <br>  "High mountains are visible where I live."<br>  <br>  Etc. etc. etc.|`|4W3v2fO5aa	be more specific...what are you trying to say and what is it for?!|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I'd take out "from" or change the sentence to "I live in a place from which you can see high mountains."

XN0cYCATaa	If a Christian commits suicide, is he still forgiven?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/questions/other-questions/if-christian-commits-suicide-he-still-forgiven" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/questions/other-ques...</a>|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	For one thing, "God" didn't give you some problems, it is a result of living in a fallen world. God could have made a "Stepford" creation in which everything worked automatically. But he didn’t. God created a world in which something far more valuable than long physical life could exist. He made a world in which love can exist and grow. In love, humans pull together and respond to suffering and calamity. In love, humans forgive one another, help one another, encourage one another and stand by one another.<br>  <br>  I've never liked that statement about God only giving people what they can handle. Suicide rates are strong evidence to me that plenty of people are given way more than they can handle.<br>  <br>  Please remember that we do not have to bear all our heartbreak on your own. If it's really wearing you down (and it sounds like it is), seek help. There's nothing shameful about saying you need help to get through a tough spot, whether that help is family, friends, spiritual, or medical/psychological.<br>  <br>  Too many times we judge why someone has suicidal thoughts or follows through with their plans. Suicide may not mean that someone wants to die, it may mean they no longer have the strength or endurance to live.They pray, they seek help, they talk to others, they do all “the right things”, but the thoughts remain. Fortunately, most don’t act on their thoughts. However, too many are struggling and suffering because we’re too embarrassed to tell, but also too embarrassed to even talk about it. Suicide happens and if you look around in a church service, I can guarantee that there is someone there who may be thinking that suicide is the only option. <br>  <br>  We don't go to Heaven or Hell because of our sins...Jesus paid for all of our sins on the cross. That's been dealt with.|`|P5FC4cOqaa	You will not go to heaven. I am not trying to scare you but it  is the truth. When you kill yourself, you murdering your own self. By the time you see God he will see that you have sinned by mudering yourself. GOD said in order to enter his kingdom you must be blameless, meaning all your sins must have been forgiven. If you kill yourself how will you repent, because there is no more forgiveness after death. Dont even blame GOD  for your physical problems. It was and never will be the will of GOD for people to suffer. People just need to understand that everybody has problems that they have to deal with. Dont you remember that there are so many people in the hospital today that suffer. So many people have illnesses, mental problems that they have to deal with. Try to find a way to deal with it or a solution.|`|hJX6Ur3taa	Yes you will still go to heaven.  All sin is forgiven.  Only certain religions believe that suicide will result in going to hell.  I would suggest pray for healing.  Sometimes it may take a while, but if you have faith it will happen.|`|lRqebHuDaa	According to the CJ all you have to do is believe in him and you'll go there no matter what.|`|xZet9Dunaa	yes you will go to hell it is a sin|`|791ZfaZlaa	Dont commit suicide!! Matthew 12:13 -->  "So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."<br>  <br>  If you commit suicide you would be "turning against the Spirit". God gave you the life and if you put your faith in him he would help you with your problems and not only with the physicals ones. God is always there for you, you can rest in him when you need it; and if you need new strength He would give it to you every single day... Wait on the Lord.. he would help you through the way...|`|204a16cd5a90c359fbcc04d8073507b0aa	i thought about this 1 long and hard - my son is deeply autistic an my niece has cerebral palsy - we only met a few years back cos she used to live in the far east.  Her granddad - my uncle is quite well read when it comes to matters of faith (now I'm talking from the Muslim point of view).<br>  <br>  he told me that on the final day when we are all being judged - my child and his grandchild will be sat together off to one side from the rest of humanity - they will refuse to answer any questions or take part in any judgment . God himself will ask them why they are upset & they will all say that they were disabled in their lives - blighted by diesease or disability - God will reply that he know & the mere fact they lived their lives guaranteed a place in heaven - immediately the veil will be removed and they will go through.  As i understand it  - just coping is enough to do that - <br>  <br>  Suicide is a sin in all of the 'revealed' religions - I could never say what is in a persons heart or that of God - so you do risk denying yourself heaven if you suicide<br>  <br>  there is a saying in my faith - rather like a truism - you have 2 lives - you're gonna go thru hell in one of em|`|xkSwcCW1aa	No you will go straight to hell.

Second - Joseph was led to seek TRUTH because all churches of the day claimed to have it and yet they all contradicted one another.  So while reading the bible, in the Epistle of James he read God's instruction that "if any of ye lack wisdom let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not....." so in earnest personal prayer he did just that and ask God to lead him to the true church.    SO his pursuit for TRUTH led him to God's personal visitation and the restoration of the Church of Christ through Joseph.<br>  <br>  Most of the previous answers are just pathetic, sad and disrespectful guys!

He went to God with a question seeking an answer of who to follow, it was God who told him to lead rather than follow.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  there are lots of comments talking about how he was a well known con arist in the are at the time - at 14?  seriously?  He was a kid that nobody really paid that much attention to until he had his vision and told it to the Methodist Minister who's church he favored (prior to the vision) over the others. <br>  <br>  All these poeple saying it was for money or women or ambition need to keep in mind - he was only 14 years old.<br>  <br>  What poor 14 year old boy would welcome persecution from virtually every direction?|`|TzY9vkinaa	The second great awakening got him to question religion. He read in the bible "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." So he did ask God.

In fact the movie American Graffiti was based on life here growing up as a teen (starring Ron Howard). Graffiti Night was cancelled more than 10 years ago because 1 person was shot (gang violence).<br>  We have closed many of our original resteraunts and many many stores/ resteraunts are vacant now<br>  Linen's n things<br>  Mervyns<br>  Acapulcos<br>  Mallards<br>  Good Guys<br>  Comp USA<br>  Circuit City<br>  Hazels fine dining<br>  Wilson's Leather<br>  John T's<br>  <br>  Not to mention that one of these crazy locals crashed through a window at clearchannel ( where most of our radio stations are located) with a machette giving no reason just stating that he "was tired of Modesto".<br>  My friend has ahouse in what is a nice area. She caught a little boy throwing rocks at her dogs, when she told him to drop it before the threw another rock, the little boy walked away only to be yelled at his mother to "throw the rock" "don't be a sissy". He was actually yelled at because he backed down and was degraded my his mom.<br>  How is HE gonna turn out eh?<br>  Lovely city.<br>  Gratefully I moved away I live in Ripon now, so much nicer, smaller.

1HfLkTrdaa	Yes, of course, homeless people have basic human and civil rights. Turning away homeless people from a church is the very thing that Jesus would've taught against...shame on those churches that discriminate like that!  Don't they realize that Christ didn't say go out and share the Good News only with the so-called "socially acceptable?"  No he said share it with the WORLD! The Gospel was for everyone regardless of their social standing.  Christ ate with sinners and tax collectors, spoke to prostitutes and people who committed adultery,  and told parables about rich men who treated poor men badly and what happened to them after they died (the rich man and Lazarus.)<br>  <br>  Also I agree regarding your 2d point in this question.  Everyone should have to show ID, no one should be exempt.  <br>  <br>  As for why they might not be asking Hispanics to show ID, well you might want to keep in mind that historically Mexican Americans were often singled out for discrimination because of questionable "illegal" status...when in fact they were US citizens. When La Migra did sweeps in  Los Angeles. sometimes Mexican Americans got rounded up as well and "deported" to Mexico...and some of those "Hispanic" folks couldn't even speak Spanish, nor had they even been to Mexico before.  Cheech Marin sings about this in the song "Born In East L.A."<br>  <br>  You do realize, of course, there are people from a lot of countries living in the US illegally and they don't just come in from from Mexico, either.  Back in the early 80s, when I was in the military I knew personally of a number of Irish, Britons, Canadians and Australians living here illegally after their visas expired...and they were panicking because the servicemember they were chasing didn't marry them and they were now facing deportation! They'd ask me what they should do and all I could do is tell them to call their consulate.<br>  <br>   I also knew of people who were of those specific groups who were technically "illegal" but working in the entertainment industry and in other professional level jobs. Some knew the workers were "illegals" but few ever questioned it and few ever got detected ...but there were some exceptions such as described by the 1972 Crosby Nash song "Immigration Man."  <br>  <br>  Also, you can see an example of "white illegals" in the 2002 film  "In America."  An Irish family crosses the border from Canada on a tourist visa....and the father instructs the girls to say to anyone who asks they're "on holiday" when in reality they were going there to live there.  They were de facto illegal aliens, but for the most part, no one would question them because they are white!|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	Yes they are people too.|`|BHyIl8pJaa	This is a good question.  Yes technically they are citizens and therefore are entitled to civil rights, but since they live outside social norms people tend to see them as less than human, thus taking away their natural and civil rights.  These people may attend church, no denomination I know would or should turn their backs on the downtrodden.  It is fundamentally against the teachings of JC to not help those in need, and therefore any church who turns these people away should be chastised.  As far as the identification, it is a don't ask don't tell policy as far as illegal immigration goes.  If you ask for id and they can not prove they are citizens then they are in violation of the law and are subject to extradition. This measure is in place to assist and not discriminate, but it can seem misleading.

One who really respect his believes and his religion never ever shows disrespect to others. <br>  <br>  Take it this way, If you respect your parents, would you ever stop your friend from respecting theirs. And if you have a friend who does makes you feel bad for you respecting your parents, would he possibly respect his own. <br>  So forget it i know you live with them and it means something. But you know what there are people who Truly are good Muslims who respect their religion and hence others. Keep looking you will find some. I did. I am not really that religious but most of my friends are but they are still my best friends, My best friend is a crazy Muslim(in a good way) she does everything accordingly and i don't. but still we are friends and do support each others believe. <br>  <br>  As long as you are not hurting anyone, Just because some one else does not respect you does not makes you bad. You don't have to feel sad, its them who needs to be feel sorry for.

F5GyrdQfaa	There was also a "Bigfoot" that was caught recently...and it turned out to be an advertising hoax by a couple of ingenius doofs. Now, just because we haven't caught one doesn't mean it isn't there, but you'd think there'd be some sort of verifiable evidence.<br>    Most of the time, the "evidence" is kept secret for some reason, or is destroyed by some 'accidental' means. That doesn't boost confidence for the skeptic. But I saw an interesting stat in Newsweek-->more people believe in the Loch Ness monster than believe in God.<br>    I guess it just goes to what "could be plausible" in people's minds.

And all black or hispanic people here are in gangs, hip hop artists, live in slums, steal, lie, or cheat to live. All middle eastern people own convenient stores or drive cabs. All Native Americans look much like they did in the 1800's. I am not stereo typing anyone.

ULTRJJ6waa	Hi. I know exactly what you mean. They are like that here also. I think most cops are on a power trip. They seem to think they are above everyone else.

OR YOUR ATTITUDE was bad to start with....<br>  <br>  he was just being business like don't take it personally. <br>  It is what they are trained to do... or he had a bad day. <br>  good luck|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Since I work in a related field I can answer this one for you perhaps.  The problem you are facing when dealing with an officer during a traffic stop is one of officer and public safety.  <br>  <br>  Current training emphasizes that being too courteous and polite when dealing with the general public during police matters can lead to hardened criminals perceiving weakness or vulnerability in the officer.  While most officers never have to deal with a hardened criminal on a traffic stop, there have been many cases documented in the yearly publication Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) report from the Department of Justice.  Government studies based on the report show that an officer asserting control and authority with a hardened criminal from the outset can save both the officer's and the subject's life.  <br>  <br>  The outcome of such a procedure is that traffic enforcement officers frequently come across as brusque and rude to the general populace during these interactions.  You should understand that this is not because they are hateful or rude individuals, but it is for the safety of everyone involved.  <br>  <br>  The best way to speed up the interaction is to keep your answers to their questions simple, and to comply with all lawfully given instructions from the officer.  Engaging the officer in light conversation, or treating the officer in a non-compliant or aggressive manner is only going to cause problems.  <br>  <br>  Edit: thumbs down will not remove the truth behind my statement.  Do some research yourself if you don't believe me about police training for safety.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: I was merely providing the rational explaination for her situation which is not centered on demonizing police officers as the bane to society.  I have personally known law enforcement members killed by hardened criminals, and I have read the government studies on the psychological profile of cop killers.  I doubt anyone else answering here can say the same.  <br>  <br>  The consistent message the professional law enforcement community is learning that being polite is frequently taken as an exploitable weakness by the criminal with the intent to engage in a cop killing.    In 2007 11 police officers were killed in the US as a result of felonious intent during traffic stops.  One of the things studies have shown is that even the experienced officers very consistently characterized as polite, community oriented, and nice guys are consistently the ones who end up killed or end up needing to shoot the suspect to protect themselves and others in these kinds of incidents.  <br>  <br>  I doubt that the person making the post above was assaulted by the police officer, but is very likely just upset that she wasn't handled in the manner she desired, which is to say never pulled over in the first place.  The fact that she characterized a desire to engage in physical conflict with the officer means she likely did not present the officer with the image of a model citizen ready to comply with lawfully given directives.  As frequently happens day in and day out for traffic officers in the US she likely started with making an excuse or denying the commission of the infraction.  When the officer proceeded to issue the citation, she likely became angry and abusive.  If you don't believe me about this being an all too common occurance for a traffic enforcement officer in the US, then you should spend some time working with and talking to one sometime. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|JiCfYfLraa	that pisses me off so much i understand they think just because they have a gun and a badge that they can do whatever they want.<br>  <br>  they are very rude they are suppose to be protecting citizens but most of the time they harm them. they are the real criminals.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I have never been in this situation.

You obviously didn't try very hard. There is more than just going to the police station that you can do. Lodge your complaint with the mayor's office, go see a county representative, speak to your other elected officials, write a letter to the chief of police or try talking with the internal affairs office of the police station rather than walking up to the front desk. While they may not result in the tongue lashing/demotion that you are hoping for, they will at least begin the process of review and develop some written record of this officer's poor conduct.|`|e0e3e97ecc5ec23822071f8a88c516b3aa	I don't know where you live?

jM7CyxQzaa	There are a lot of similarities between the two paths. <br>  <br>  The definition for Witch depends on which version you are talking about tho, either the Wiccan or the traditional witch (wicca being a religeon and God and Goddess orientated, Witch being the magical practice rather than the religeous side of it - I'm assuming you mean the Traditional Witch here so I'll go with that)<br>  <br>  Basically both Shamans and Witches 'walk between the worlds' that is they both have the ability to cross over into the other planes and return at will. Both use herbs and other natural products to work their magic and both use trance and similar inner meditation work to journey. They also both can work for the community rather than on their own, and both can act as healers if neccessary. The latter two however are not as necessary for a Witch as they are for a Shaman, those are integral in the shamanic path, and a choice for the individual witch.<br>  <br>  Ok the differences - Shamanism is more indigenous in places like north and south america and the northern lands (lapland etc) Witches are usually more European based (historically speaking - this does not hold true nowadays)<br>  <br>  Shamans tend to be a more accepted part of their community, they are called (rather than by choice as many Witches are) to take up their shamanic duties - this happens in the form of a very serious illness, usually life threatening, which they can only recover from if they accept their path and do not fight it. They receive training from both the previous Shaman and also the 'plant and animal allies' they will work with. Witches can either be taught as part of a coven, work by instinct, work according to their family tradition or even just not even consider themselves as witches at all - this is a far more hidden path than Shamanism.<br>  <br>  Shamans work for the community - so far as I know there is not so much work on the Self other than the initial training they receive unlike many modern witches who will quite often work for their own development spiritually or otherwise (this is not a Bad thing just a difference in outlook). A Shaman's role is as healer, and spiritual leader of their community, they are teachers and storytellers and history keepers too.<br>  <br>  Their healing is more likely to take the form of the Shaman actually journeying (through meditation) to the otherworlds and there actually petitioning for the healing of the person they are working for. Shamans therefore take a more active personal role in the healing of their patients as Witches are far more likely to do some kind of healing spell and back it up with good solid care in the mundane world and so are kinda more 'removed' from the patient magically. It is not uncommon for Shamans to experience difficulties and 'fights' to recover parts of the patient's soul or some other object that is needed by the patient to recover whilst they are in the Otherworld  - this is part of their service to the community, a Witch may do this if she pleases but she won't be expected to in the same way the culture would expect a Shaman to work - generally witches don't work like this, as I said their magic is usually more removed from their patient. <br>  <br>  Witches by contrast are often seen as 'dangerous' people, while I believe shamans can be asked to 'hex' people I think that that is a much less known about aspect of shamanism, Traditional witches should be able to hex even if they *choose* not to since hexing and healing are two sides of the same coin. Witches are not as accepted by the community as Shamans are, Shamans are called in by the family to act for their loved one, witches are more likely to be acting alone at the behest of one person in the family who believes they can help, it is less open and accepted than shamanism.<br>  <br>  As regards power I dont' really feel you can compare the two, the workings and the journeying are similar and each path has evolved in it's own specific area as it has for very good reasons - as a peope we in the west are far less accepting of the concept of 'witchcraft' 'spells' 'healing' and suchlike so these things were done clandestinely. (you only have to take a look at your replies here to see that's true) Shamans however are highly respected in their own cultures and are cared for within that community as an important part of it. If Witches had been as accepted who knows how their work would have evolved.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit, I'm sure you will get a lot more varying replies as well :0|`|4TX26viFaa	The basic differences between them is what determines the name.  A shaman is an individual who focuses completely on helping the community they live in, they're not doing magic for simply themselves or a few others, their work covers the entire community.<br>  <br>  They also make use of guides and helpers, using them to journey to the alternate world where they receive their gifts or powers, or expand what they have, and they ask the guides there to send energy to help the person the shaman is focusing on.<br>  <br>  It's like a priest. <br>  <br>  Witchs vary, but basically it's the individual that focuses on learning by and for themselves, keeping things internal.  They may or may not have guides and helpers.  They may not feel obligated to help others if not asked, since the basic tenant is to 'not interfer with other's lives' meaning if someone does not ask them to help them, then they won't initiate anything to help the other as it's not something that was requested.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	Both are similar and either can be just as 'powerful' (though that tends not to be the goal of either).<br>  <br>  However, I find that your AVERAGE Shaman tends to be more well studied and well practiced than your AVERAGE witch - owing mostly to the vast number of folks who dabble.|`|AA11403222	They are both very similar.  A shaman practices his craft differently than a witch.  Both should study for many years, but more shamans do that then witches.  Most people don't dabble in shamanism, but do in witchcraft.  A shaman deal a lot with spirit animals and the spirit world; they are more likely to be healers than a witch.  A witch will use spells, candles, herbs, stones, etc. to achieve her/his ends.  The Shaman normally just does a spirit journey and get the help or advise from the spirit realm.  Both have great potential, and both can be powerful.  I would say that the shaman has more possibility of having more power, since his power is more directly linked with the Other World than the normal witch, but there are always exceptions.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	I do not like putting the idea of power in with witches and shamans.  It is not a concept many would use, though it may be what attracts some, especially to learn and practise witchcraft.<br>  <br>  There are several good answers already, so I will just add that what I see as the main difference is that a shaman just gets 'called' without having much choice in the matter, whereas a 'witch' usually decides or happens to meet others or read a book, which leads to  a long journey of learning about oneself, people, animals, the world and many other topics. <br>  <br>  A witch may see witchcraft as a craft, and learning is not finding out about the new, but revealing what is already known about the old. Some   see witchcraft as a religion, while others see it a something one does.  It is very individual.   Most prefer to work with others, though this is not always possible.<br>  <br>  Shamans simply are.  They may follow the pagan religion and sometimes work with witches as this does provide company, but what they do, as a shaman, is done alone, without the support of a group.  It can be a lonely and hard path. <br>  <br>  As for power, potential, well it is not done to tell or boast about what one can do in our society.  In tribes shamans were public as they practiced for those they knew well, while witches were often feared or asked for help by the small community where they lived.  Now we live in anonymous large groups, not knowing neighbours, and in societies which disapprove of both shamans and witches so it is not a good idea to be too public.|`|dFBccLExaa	Neither. They're different branches of the same tree. A shaman is said to walk with "one foot in this world, and one foot in the next" showing that they have good links with other planes. A witch is someone who is knowledgable. Both can be powerful, both are strong. And neither's goal is to be super powerful either. I'd tell you to read up on what both are, and come to your own conclusion based off of what they really are, and not some convoluted version that you see in movies or games.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Neither can do anything you or I couldn't do.

As cheesy as all of that sounds, I think those are really fun. Everyone gets to know each other and everyone hangs out as a group so you can be with everyone at once. <br>  <br>  Also, try inviting people that like to have fun. Don't invite many boring people (sorry) cause they can bring down the mood of the party.<br>  <br>  Hope it goes well :)

l4DBJdJGaa	i live about 45 minutes from the Myrtles in Baton Rouge. one day me, my mom, and my grandmother went there to take a tour of the place. there's lots of chilly places there, but i didn't see a ghost at the house. when we went to leave, it was pouring down raining outside so i offered to get the car for my mom and my grandmother. while i was waiting for them, my mom and grandmother were walking across the street sharing an umbrella between the two of them and with a little black girl. when they reached the car, the girl had disappeared and my family got in the car. as we were driving off, i asked them who the little girl was and they responded that they never saw one. that it was just the two of them under the umbrella. i said, no, there was a little girl in a dress walking with them. but they said that they were alone and never saw such a girl.<br>  <br>  later on i reread the history of the myrtles and there is a ghost of a little black girl who was caught snooping on the owners. for her punishment her ears were cut off. her description is one in the same with the little girl i saw that night in the rain holding hands with my grandmother.

fc201279b728cf66cb3edc5fb588f42eaa	I recommend visiting: <a href="http://realityofjesus.webs.com" rel="nofollow">http://realityofjesus.webs.com</a>|`|pakIAYWoaa	after the resurrection Jesus showed the apostles from the scripture how the Christ had to be betrayed, crucified and rise from the grave after 3 days.  I study the whole bible and it is so.  The prophetic element cannot be dismissed.  God said he would scatter Israel to the four corners of the earth and then in the last days regather them and place them in Israel again.  Amazing...Jesus said the temple would be taken apart stone by stone so no two were resting on each other, this was fulfilled in 70 ad.  He said another would come whom the jews would accept as Messiah and the abomination of desolation that Daniel spoke about would take place in the temple.  The jews have all the implements for temple worship rebuilt and trained priest; they are expecting a man who will bring peace and allow the temple.  Russia and Iran are aligned as Ezekiel 38 call for this future war;  Babylon is being rebuilt and will be the new center for the UN down the road.  The church founded by Jews who found the real messiah demonstrated by the resurrection.  When you look at the teachings of Christ compared to the law we see the intent of God.  The tribulation is around the corner; read your bible prayerfully and see the message of hope, love, grace,mercy,  the wrath of the lamb of God is about to be poured out as many as call upon the name of the Lord will be saved|`|oBmLIDHtaa	I know that most 'christians' are nothing like him.|`|e17aCw0Caa	Once I believed In Jesus Christ then I read The Bible and I stopped believing in him!|`|LjsRfaskaa	Christ means light. When the early Christians tried to convert the Celts they plagiarized all their festivals, dates and all. All they did was substitute Jesus instead of the Sun as the messiah. Ie, as per the Celtic Cross which is the Sun in the cross constellation in the spring equinox, easter, signifying the resurrection of life after its death in the winter. <br>  <br>  I do not recognize Jesus as being the messiah because it is the Sun. There is more external evidence of the lost continent of Atlantis than there is for Jesus.|`|7sEFufRbaa	I  will not speak for other Christians buy my belief in God stems from pure logic. I know, shocking, isn't it? Even science admits that a 'thing' cannot be created, spontaneously from 'nothing.' All things in our existence are derivative of other 'things.' Trees are converted to lumber, iron ore infused with carbon in the form of ash is converted to steel. You get the gist.<br>  <br>  Yet how does this explain the existence of the universe? How did the universe come into being? Was there not a point in time and space where there was nothing? The big bang only explains the rapid expansion, evolution and distribution of matter that resulted in the universe, NOT it's origin. So if the greatest thing (ie the universe) was spontaneously created from absolutely nothing would not logic dictate that some sort of 'being' who exists without the confines and constraints of science be responsible for the creation of the matter that resulted in the rapid expansion of the big bang?

Dont worry about their ethnicity, get some professional pics of them and take them to different agencies. Also I thought most Asia parents want their kids to be doctors and lawyers and what not.|`|sxmQSpagaa	there are a fair amount of asian child models used in the united states. the key (and this goes to any parent of any child of any nationality) is patience. take good, clear headshots and go to every screening and audition you can. when you get rejected, don't think it's just because your boys are par-asian - one look at all the rejected white kids will prove that wrong. it's just about finding the casting director who wants the look your child has. a good place to start is with catalogs, they will often times cast children of many different nationalities to give a worldly feel to the catalog. good luck!|`|3ztjaDBaaa	Most child stars grow up ****** up. I think Asian parents love their kids too much to do this to their kids, all for the sake of having a child they can brag about.

He, literally, favors redistribution of income as being more important – and more a function of the president – than the creation of wealth.<br>  It amounts to, literally, a war on the business community.” <br>  <br>  He failed to live up to his commitment to change Washington by backing a $410 billion spending bill stuffed full of lawmakers' pet projects. <br>  The projects -- known as "earmarks" -- directly violated Obama's vow to get tough on spending. <br>  <br>  The truth is that far-left extremists are unleashed and are going for the gold. Their code words are social justice and shared sacrifice. Social justice means empowering the government to seize the assets of affluent Americans and distribute them to the less well-off. Shared sacrifice means punitive taxation on high wage earners and corporations. That, of course, is socialism.<br>  <br>   I was just reading about Obama's plan to cut charity tax limits. He says the govt. has set aside money to help shore up the charities.<br>  So once again, government is stepping in.<br>  <br>  I don't want this "more government" in my face.<br>  <br>  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor, putting us at risk and basically demolishing ( insert Superman music here) truth, justice and the American way as we knew it. He is allowing Pelosi, Reid et alia to do what they wish with our future and those of the generations to come.<br>  <br>   If we're stuck with him for the next four, the least we can do is weed out some of the idiots in congress in 2010.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	10.

The magazine asserts that Pelosi's anti-Republican stance is annoying Mr. Obama, who wants to cultivate some GOP support. Also, Ms. Pelosi is so far left that the White House fears a strong backlash if the economy continues to dive. Nancy Pelosi's favorability rating is about 35% and sinking, but the far left is undaunted - they continue to criticize President Obama over Iraq and for not spending even more taxpayer dollars.<br>   Leading the way is the radical left Service Employees International Union, a huge financial supporter of Obama. That union, allied with George Soros and Ms. Pelosi, is pushing for a dramatic change in America that would badly diminish our capitalistic system. So now we understand what's really happening in Washington - while President Obama may be trying to fix the economy, he is also allowing radical elements of the Democratic Party to damage the economic core of America. Obama is not only facing a nasty recession, he's being battered by the far left. If the president does not stand up to them, he and we will suffer dire consequences.<br>  President Obama's continuing popularity will hinge partly on Wall Street. Since Obama took office the market is down 1,200 points and that has to be shaking him up a little bit. <br>  If this continues for three or four more months, people will turn on him with a vengeance.<br>  <br>  Get rid of Pelosi for starters!|`|8rGZFBKOaa	I give him a 4 - work in progress.<br>  I'll bet he's had to have a daily dose of Advil.<br>  I'll also bet before his term is over, he'll have a whole new appreciation for what George W. had to put up with and go through.<br>  Humility is a hard lesson for those with so little to start with..........<br>  I give the guy a 4 and rising for good measure.|`|Znw52fxkaa	How about a link to the politics section?|`|t88527U1aa	1 you cannot throw money at bigger Government and expect a country in depression to recover!

Although men have developed their scientific knowledge to an unprecedented extent, they have not been able to conquer sickness or put an end to death, not even for one individual. Human rule has not eliminated war, violence, crime, corruption, or poverty. Oppressive governments still dominate the people in many lands. (Ecclesiastes 8:9) Technology, greed, and ignorance combine to pollute the land, water, and air. Economic mismanagement by officials makes it hard for many to obtain the necessities of life. Thousands of years of human rule have made this fact obvious: “To earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.<br>  2 What is the solution? God’s Kingdom, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 6:9,?10) God’s heavenly Kingdom is described at 2?Peter 3:13 as the “new heavens,” which is to rule over the “new earth,” that is, righteous human society. So important is God’s heavenly Kingdom that Jesus made it the focus of his preaching. (Matthew 4:17) He showed the place that it should have in our lives, urging: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.”—Matthew 6:33.|`|OSesKrXaaa	He's certainly more ambitious than the last couple presidents we've had, but I won't say whether I think he's doing good or bad as of yet- it's too early to tell.<br>  <br>  The country is still suffering from 8 years of poor management- I don't see how we can expect to see results after just 2 months of new administration.  <br>  <br>  If I had to venture a guess and give an opinion, yeah- I think he's doing alright... but I'm not gonna impose a number on it.|`|bB7j9Mpgaa	negative 10|`|SINgsfVNaa	He working really hard to help fix what Bush messed up, so I give him a ........10!|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	I actually gave him a 7 the first week or so....but now   a generous 3|`|JQLpNJzuaa	Meh...<br>  <br>  Better than I expected, and well on his way to getting himself "terminated" by the Government.<br>  <br>  I'd like him to END the Islamite war in Iraq, though.<br>  <br>  I'll give him an 8.|`|AAGW4kAhaa	Obama is not Super Man!

and there is plenty narrations by Ali(ra) and Fatima(ra). just as much as there is Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman(ra) narration<br>  <br>  and they are barely any Narrations of Muawiya. good honest question.<br>  <br>  ya but Ayesha(ra) was the prophets(pbuh) wife. she is a member his household(pbuh). the Disrespect of Companions Def. w/o any clear Evidence is Unislamic and disrespectful to Beliefers.|`|D4xmy588aa	to you your way and to me mine<br>  <br>  clearly you won't accept us and we wont accept you<br>  <br>  so why do you continue to ask<br>  <br>  we already have an athiest pretending to be an ex-sunni. just let him ask all the stupid questions and just go to sleep.<br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  okay then first define plenty and as dawn said show statistics the other point is how many hadith have you read are you a scholar of hadith. the next point is do you know that our hadith have a chain of narration, so although one might not be the final person who is mentioned there name will be mentioned along the chain of narrations, which means that infact they did narrate the hadith but was not the first or the last person to narrate it.<br>  <br>  But my question to you would be why do you fabricate hadith against the prophet and ahlul bayt?<br>  <br>  and my other question to you would be why do you have more hadith from Ali (Ra) than are narrated from the prophet (saw)<br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  <br>  So occording to YOU the saying of your TWELVE IMAAMS is greater and outweighs he statement of the prophet Muhammed (Saw) who is ONE in number.<br>  <br>  And then you say that you don't fabricate hadith lmao.<br>  <br>  how can you not fabricate when you take from people who you claim that they claim revelation.<br>  <br>  So my point is you even fabricate hadith against your 12 imaams. you people are nothing short of lying hypocrites<br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  Your new statement is just as worse since you take your hadith from people who are not the prophet therefore as a result you follow a religion other than that of the religion of the prophet (saw).|`|p5cglKf0aa	EIGHTH EXAMPLE: Tirmidhi reports from Ibn Abbas through an authentic narration: "The Messenger of Allah asked a Beduin, 'Will you testify that I am the Messenger of Allah, if a branch of that tree comes to me when I call to it?' 'Yes,' he replied, and Allah's Messenger called to the branch. It broke off and jumped over near to him. It again jumped back to the tree when he told it to do so." Like these eight examples, there are many others related through various chains of transmission. Seven or eight strands of rope form a strong cable when they come together. Similarly, those miracles that were reported on the authority of the best-known Companions in various chains certainly have the strength of tawatur in meaning, or even in reality. In fact, they take on the form of tawatur when passed on by the Companions to the following generation. In particular, the accurate books of narration such as Bukhari, Muslim, Ibn Hibban and Tirmidhi have made and kept the chain leading back to the age of the Prophet (ASW) so sound that reading a narration, say in Bukhari, is equivalent to hearing it directly from the Companions. If trees, as seen in these examples, recognize the Prophet (ASW), testify to his messengership, visit and salute him, and obey his orders; and those heartless and brainless beings who call themselves human beings do not know and believe in him, will they not be more trifling than a piece of wood and worthy of hellfire? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&t=The+Nineteenth+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&...</a>

AA10671142	that is so true. we are all equal in Jehovah's eyes and we are suppose to love our neighbor as our self. how can we love our neighbor and be a racist because someone has a different skin color or speaks a different language. or someone is handicapped. this is the 21 century and there still is so much hate in the world and people don't see it. people go to war and kill each other or they kill without going to war because they don't like what someone said to them|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Hello brother,<br>  <br>  Good question.<br>  <br>  If a person is racist, then he is elevating himself as higher than God because God's word the bible tells us that Jehovah is not partial.<br>  Acts 10:34<br>  <br>  For a person who's supposed to love God to be racist is hypocritical & arrogant|`|4hsl2toNaa	There are many Gods, who are they serving?  1John 5:19   tells us Satan is the God of this world.

In this regard Barnes’ Notes on the New Testament (1974) observes: “It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here .?.?. There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such.”<br>  The title occurs again at Revelation 21:6, and the following verse identifies the speaker by saying: “Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I shall be his God and he will be my son.” Inasmuch as Jesus referred to those who are joint heirs with him in his Kingdom as “brothers,” not “sons,” the speaker must be Jesus’ heavenly Father, Jehovah God.—Mt 25:40; compare Heb 2:10-12.|`|yhTPcF81aa	Jesus never said that.

(Isaiah 30:20) Our God declares: “I am the Alpha and the Omega, .?.?. the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.” (Revelation 1:8) This is the first of three times in Revelation that Jehovah himself speaks from heaven. (See also Revelation 21:5-8; 22:12-15.) First-century Christians would quickly have recognized alpha and omega as the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. Jehovah’s calling himself by those two letters stresses that before him, there was no almighty God, and there will be none after him. He will bring to a successful conclusion, for all eternity, the issue of Godship. He will be forever vindicated as the one and only almighty God, Supreme Sovereign over all of his creation.—Compare Isaiah 46:10; 55:10,?11.|`|OtKBv2GHaa	It means that he has always been here and always will be. in the beginning everything was made through him and by him and everything will be destroyed by his had. he was and is, he is and is to come.|`|3GO5k5nNaa	SJC, <br>  <br>  I dont think that these words can be attributed to Jesus (Upon who be peace).<br>  <br>  I believe that this verss will have been taken out of recent versions of the bible as it was a later addition.

j5YwuVEIaa	Terrorism—Soon to End!<br>  A BUS in Jerusalem, a federal building in Oklahoma City, or an apartment building in Moscow can all be targets of terrorism. Although terrorists apparently want to convey a powerful message to politicians, military leaders, or economic leaders, there often seems to be no link between their cause and their target. In many cases the actual targets are ordinary people—people who have nothing to do with the terrorists’ avowed cause. Why, then, do extremists resort to acts of terrorism?<br>  Why Terrorism?<br>  Terrorism is systematic, premeditated, and calculated. The resulting toll in deaths and injuries is not the primary objective. Such carnage is a means to an end, part of the atmosphere of shock and fear that the terrorist wishes to create in order to undermine authority and gain a hearing for his specific cause. Consider some of the factors behind the violent acts of terrorists.<br>  Hatred. “Terrorism .?.?. is fueled by hatred,” stated Louis J. Freeh, director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. “Those who harbor such hatred live in a world that is colored by bigotry, shaded by conspiracy, and framed by ignorance.”<br>  Oppression. “To be sure, there are leaders of groups and countries whose irrational goals are the annihilation of other cultures,” writes Stephen Bowman in his book When?the Eagle Screams. “But it is also clear that a great deal of terrorism is born of despair.”<br>  Frustration. “In many cases .?.?. the primary motivation for a terrorist is a genuine frustration with seemingly intractable political, social, and economic forces,” observes the editor of the book Urban Terrorism.<br>  Injustice. “Terrorism is a symptom of a problem, not the actual cause,” remarks Michael Shimoff in his paper “The Policy of Terrorism.” He continues: “Our long-term goal should be to eliminate the underlying social and political causes of terrorism. .?.?. Paralleling our actions against terrorism, we must have equally vigorous efforts to enhance freedom, dignity, justice, and humanitarian values. Only when those vigorous efforts are effective, will we be able to dismantle our counter-terrorism and anti-terrorism operations.”<br>  The causes and history of terrorism have proved the truth of the Biblical statement: “Man has dominated man to his injury.” (Ecclesiastes 8:9) The Bible even foretold the traits that have nurtured terrorism. It says: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, .?.?. having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride.”—2?Timothy 3:1-4.<br>  The reality is that human efforts to combat terrorism, no matter how sincerely motivated, cannot successfully deal with its causes. The Bible realistically observes: “To earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (Jeremiah 10:23) However, while the solution to the problem of terrorism is beyond human power, it certainly is not beyond God’s power.<br>  The Solution<br>  Those who have been wronged or oppressed and who feel frustrated can find comfort in the Bible’s sure promise: “The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.”—Proverbs 2:21, 22.<br>  This promise of God will soon be fulfilled. His Ruler, the reigning King Jesus Christ, will see to that. A Bible prophecy says regarding Christ: “He will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth.”—Isaiah 11:3, 4.<br>  Yes, God’s Son, Jesus Christ, will soon eliminate all injustice as well as those responsible for it. In God’s righteous new system, terrorism and violence of every kind will be things of the past. Then everyone on earth will live in security, free from fear of any harm.—Revelation 21:3,?4.|`|8wgcbGupaa	The major cause of terrorism is injustice. whenever a person or a group of persons feel that they are not given their due right and there is nobody to do the remedy, they tend to snatch their right through use of force. it is here the terrorism originates from. However at a higher level, countries or states also terrorise other countries of the world to fulfill their evil designs like hegemonic/financial/political control over them. The countries, the terrorists belong to/hired by, are directly responsible for the act of terrorism.<br>  Terrorism within a country can be eradicated by implementing an unbiased system of justice. Internationally, by giving equal status to all member countries in UNO. The power of "veto" in UNO is a major hurdle to eradicate terrorism by powerful countries against the weeker ones.|`|vOwfC1SJaa	Terrorism is as old as the human race, it will never go away.|`|AA10554783	Cain!|`|6dL7UGvfaa	Its origin is in ignorance.

hYQTOabRaa	People get so caught up with thinking that Jehovah is so concerned with how we pronounce his name.<br>  <br>  He is our Father and we are His precious children.  He loves us despite our imperfections.<br>  <br>  How do you feel when a small child that you love tries to speak, perhaps even tries to say your name, but doesn't get  the pronounciation quite right?  Doesn't the child's efforts become endearing to you?<br>  <br>  I have a friend who's name is Kahmala and my 21 month old daughter calls her Mia.  Kahmala loves it so much that my daughter even tries to say her name.  She'll probably always want her to call her Mia now.  When my brother Lorenzo was 2 my brother Nickolas was born. Lorenzo could not say Nickolas, he called him Nickas - which my mom decided to spell Nikkis.  When Nickolas started to talk he could not say Lorenzo, he called him Renzo.  10 years later those are still their nicknames.<br>  <br>  Just as we find it endearing when our children make these efforts, our God Jehovah does as well.  I highly doubt he will keep us from everlasting life for such a 'crime'.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	“Jehovah” is the best known English pronunciation of the divine name, although “Yahweh” is favored by most Hebrew scholars. The oldest Hebrew manuscripts present the name in the form of four consonants, commonly called the Tetragrammaton (from Greek te?tra-, meaning “four,” and gram′ma, “letter”). These four letters (written from right to left) are ???? and may be transliterated into English as YHWH (or, JHVH).<br>  The Hebrew consonants of the name are therefore known. The question is, Which vowels are to be combined with those consonants? Vowel points did not come into use in Hebrew until the second half of the first millennium?C.E. (See HEBREW, II [Hebrew Alphabet and Script].) Furthermore, because of a religious superstition that had begun centuries earlier, the vowel pointing found in Hebrew manuscripts does not provide the key for determining which vowels should appear in the divine name.|`|pOTigVYPaa	In researching God's personal name, Jehovah, you'll find that the early Hebrew contained no vowels, the reader supplying the correct vowels as they read along.  Thus there is no actual way for reader's today to know exactly which vowels, whether a, e, i, o, u, was used.  However, the most commonly accepted form in use today is Jehovah.  The same could be said for other Hebrew names such as Jeremiah, Joshua, even Jesus.   It's not knowing the exact way of pronouncing the name that is important, but rather that the name is used.  Romans 10:13 says, " For everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved."  Some Bible translations substitute God's name in this verse with the word LORD, but whenever the word LORD is used in all capital letters, the original word is Jehovah.  By reading the Preface at the front of most Bibles, it will explain this.  However, some Bible translations have completely removed the name from their Bibles although the name appears nearly 7,000 in the Hebrew scriptures alone.  Jesus, in the Lord's Prayer, asked that we pray that God's name be "hallowed" or made holy.  And Jesus stated at John 17:6 and 26 that he had made his father's name known to those in the world, the ones he preached to.|`|DapNp1Kxaa	The same way that we, here in this culture, rarely use the name Yeheshua, but prefer to use "Jesus", I'd say no. I have a hard enough time with English, let alone Hebrew. I love the sound of the name of Jehovah, but I also love the sound of Yahweh. No matter in what language it's said, I love it. I don't think anyone will be faulted for mispronouncing a name, as long as we magnify the glory of the personage who carries it.

However, consider a story: it, too, is nonphysical, but without a physical medium (such as a book), it no longer exists, either.  The physical medium is not the story, yet the story itself doesn't exist apart from a physical medium. Similarly, you can say that our thoughts are not the same thing as our brain, but that doesn't mean that we can think without a physical brain. It just doesn't stand to reason.<br>  <br>  2 - You might be clamining that something cannot inspect or consider its own mechanism. I fail to see how this is true. For example, in Excel, you can have the program trace a formula to see the answers at each step. There's no reason a person, which is much more complex, could not perform a more complicated, but analogous, function. <br>  <br>  Finally, you hit the classical problem of dualism, which goes back a few centuries now: if there is a nonphysical thing that is essentially who we are, then how on earth does it interact with a material body? It should be like Casper through a wall, moving right on through. Our bodies couldn't interact with it anymore than it could interact with us.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Hey Einstein, most atheists do not believe in the existence of a soul.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	I've gotten lost in my mind and figured out the answer to life ... only to sneeze and lose my train of thought.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	sigh<br>  <br>  2 points|`|6aa3462db415d437fbd6038465117c79aa	What the hell does that have to do with an old book full of fairy tales ?<br>  There's nothing more hilarious than a person who believes in invisible and inaudible creatures living in invisible places trying to sound rational.<br>  If you can accept those things as facts, then you most certainly are not ready to study anything about your own mind.

yMVdKHhmaa	some experiments were done by a doctor  beaurieux in 1908<br>  This is his account of the experiment, don't try this at home!<br>  <br>  "here, then, is what i was able to note immediately after the decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the guillotined man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds. this phenomenon has been remarked by all those finding themselves in the same conditions as myself for observing what happens after the severing of the neck...<br>  <br>  i waited for several seconds. the spasmodic movements ceased. [...] it was then that i called in a strong, sharp voice: 'languille!' i saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions – i insist advisedly on this peculiarity – but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts.<br>  <br>  next languille's eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves. i was not, then, dealing with the sort of vague dull look without any expression, that can be observed any day in dying people to whom one speaks: i was dealing with undeniably living eyes which were looking at me. after several seconds, the eyelids closed again[...].<br>  <br>  it was at that point that i called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. i attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement – and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead." <br>  <br>  although decapitation leads to sudden loss of blood pressure there will still be a certain amount of blood remaining in the brain.|`|1IVEYMA9aa	I dont know about people, but if you want to hear a story about a chicken who lived many months after being decapitated, its crazy.

Even if he is, he's not immune to sinning and doing wrong things - not that I'm condoning his actions.  I suspect you may have provoked him in some way? I'm not saying that this excuses such language, but I just doubt anyone would randomly come out with that.  I find it interesting how you have worded that question - when an atheist stood on the street, insulting religion and people of faith rather harshly (and using the most offensive language), I didn't come on here and ask atheists to come and account for the actions of "one of their own".  When I heard from friends that atheists in their country had been burning down churches and had been very aggressive in their country, I didn't come on here and ask the atheists to account for their actions.  And it's not like their aren't atheists on R&S who make rude comments, but I try not to tar all the atheists with the same brush.  Should I ask each time that the other atheists share their opinions about one of their own.  I don't mean to have a rant at you, but why is it that many people here refuse to acknowledge that Christians are individuals too, and can make mistakes too, and that when they do, it doesn't mean they are accurately representing the faith.  Same way I don't believe that actions of atheists (for example the one who said that people of faith should be killed!) represents the views of them all.  I do, however, wish to reiterate that I think his comment towards you was wrong, provoked or not, Christian or not.  It's a hurtful thing to say so I'm sorry you were told that.  Please try to ignore it and not feel too upset by it, and I'm sure you'll find that most Christians are not supportive of his actions.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	Rudeness and arrogance are not bound by faith or lack thereof.<br>  <br>  I decided long ago that I am through offering apologies for actions by others supposedly of my faith, as I really don't see what purpose it serves.<br>  <br>  Open-minded individuals will understand that there are poor representatives from * both * sides of the spectrum and simply leave it at that.|`|AA11718880	LOL.

Pray for Him and for all of us as I pray for all of you! May you have a Blessed day!|`|AA11164665	If you're going to be attacked by a rather naive Christian then quote the bible at them. Might I suggest:<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:1-5 (New King James Version)<br>  <br>   1 “Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. 3 And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank is in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.<br>  <br>  or perhaps, given the nature of the accusation:<br>  <br>  John 8:2-11 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   2And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 3And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 4They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 5Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?<br>  <br>   6This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 7So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 8And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<br>  <br>   9And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 10When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 11She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<br>  <br>  No Christian should condemn or judge any other person. Whilst they may believe that they have had their own sins forgiven they ought to be very aware of their own sinful nature and thus should be compassionate and understanding of the failings of others. Furthermore they are charged to forgive the sins of others:<br>  <br>  Mark 11:25 (New International Version)<br>  <br>  25And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.<br>  <br>  So really, not only should he not judge you, but even if he believes you to have sinned he should forgive you and get over it. Of course, if he thinks you are in trouble then it would be loving for him to try and point it out (like an intervention for an alcoholic or something) but it ought to be done in a respectful manner or else we're back to the judging thing. <br>  <br>  I would hope that you might understand from these passages that Christ's message was of forgiveness and understanding and absolutely NOT about judging or accusing. Christians that act otherwise are a little mislead and could do with some sound teaching - but after all they(we) are only human.|`|212F2EO0aa	Actually he stated "the biblical writers would consider you a loose heathen tramp"<br>  <br>  You are correct. <br>  <br>  Unless he is your husband he has no grounds to make that claim as factual.|`|XwuZYLg1aa	If I could apologize for him I would.

If you look at what Jesus taught, what He did in the bible, this guy's actions do not line up what Jesus did. Actually, Jesus spent time with the loose women in the bible, allowed them to touch Him, etc, which was appalling to the religious leaders of that day. That's one of the things they hated about Him. There's no way Jesus would have said what the guy said. I believe you when you say you're not what this guy called you. That guys was wrong for saying what he said, and does not have a heart like Jesus.<br>  <br>     I don't know your name, but say it's Kristen. It would be like if someone went around saying "I'm a Kristen follower" and then stole money from a store, something you would never do. You have no control over someone identifying their self with you, and I'm sure you would want people to judge you only on what you did, not what someone else claiming to follow you did. That's what Jesus wants too, to be judged by His words and actions, not others claiming to follow Him. <br>  <br>    You can judge all Christians this way. You can check their words and actions and ideals against Jesus and see if overall, they match up or not. Of course, you have to be familiar with the scripture stories about Jesus to do so. But please, judge us by Jesus, don't judge Jesus by us.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	what he judges others with will be judged back to him 10 fold.  That's between you and him and him and God.

gDVQNMR7aa	The West is a bit behind times in some things. Narrow minded people have played a huge role in this problem. Quite actually there are references to reincarnation in the bible, but most people choose to accept the interpretations of others, rather than really look and think about them themselves. Karma is most certainly brought up in the bible.<br>  <br>  I believe both exist without one doubt.|`|LjsRfaskaa	People will deny the obvious in favor of their own pet theory. There are literally hundreds of thousands of cases of reincarnation, not to mention medical reports of obe's. On the other hand there is zero evidence of an external God. <br>  <br>  It must be their stubborn reliance in blind faith. Which I find rather ironic in a so called spiritual organization when the objective is enlightenment. It so full of  oxymoron's that I wonder how anyone can take it seriously. And that is without taking into account their violent history full of atrocities against humanity.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	It is an ignoring of the fact that ancient Hebrews did believe in reincarnation.

I can't speak to why other religions would teach that.<br>  <br>  Also, the Church does not teach "hellfire and brimstone." The Catholic Church says that the worste part of hell is the absence of God--anything beyond that cannot be known (ie. "hellfire and brimstone")|`|9447d6d4627edef320b8495e7ad8a770aa	Take a look at The Church of Religious Science founded by Ernest Holmes. He wrote a book called Science of Mind. Hell is simply a discordant state of being. Give and be thankful and all other wants and needs will come without effort. God is love that is unconditional and eternal, therefore there can be no judgment and place to go where God is not. Fear is the opposite of love and when you live in fear, you are not in harmony with your Source. This illusion of time and space is meant for us to create and experience. What is real is that we are all one with God and when you are in harmony with love and joy the hell and suffering will subside.

I would rather not be in a fake relationship. In terms of religions there is a lot of baggage that comes with most of them in exchange for the comfort of the idea of immortality. I would rather not be discriminatory against certain groups based on false comfort or make life choices that decreased the quality of the one life I know I get as some would require.

They are a popular sport fish, though elusive. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. They reach a maximum size of 177 in. (455 cm) and 1,400 lb (650kg). The International Game Fish Association's all-tackle angling record for a swordfish was a 1,182 lb (536.15 kg) specimen taken off Chile in 1953.<br>  <br>  They are the sole member of their family Xiphiidae.<br>  <br>  The swordfish is named after its sharp beak resembling a sword (Latin gladius), which together with its streamlined physique allows it to cut through the water with great ease and agility. Contrary to belief the "sword" is not used to spear, but instead may be used to slash at its prey in order to injure the prey animal, to make for an easier catch. Mainly the swordfish relies on its great speed, capable of reaching speeds up to 50 mph (80 kilometers/ ph), and agility in the water to catch its prey. One possible defensive use for the sword-like bill is for protection from its few natural predators. The shortfin mako shark is one of the rare sea creatures big enough and fast enough to chase down and kill an adult swordfish, but they don't always win. Sometimes in the struggle with a shark a swordfish can kill it by ramming it in the gills or belly.<br>  <br>  Females grow larger than males, with males over 300 lb (135 kg) being rare. Females mature at 4-5 years of age in northwest Pacific while males mature first at about 3 to 4 years. In the North Pacific, batch spawning occurs in water warmer than 24 °C from March to July and year round in the equatorial Pacific. Adult swordfish forage includes pelagic fish including small tuna, dorado, barracuda, flying fish, mackerel, as well as benthic species of hake and rockfish. Squid are important when available. Swordfish are thought to have few predators as adults although juveniles are vulnerable to predation by large pelagic fish.|`|P5rczL0Saa	The pope has no authority, except that which he gives himself, or that the catholic church gave him.

Umar through an exalted and sound chain of narrators: "In the course of an expedition, a Beduin came to Allah's Messenger. The Messenger asked him, 'Where are you going?' He said, 'To my family.' Allah's Messenger asked, 'Don't you want something better than that?' The Beduin said, 'What is it?' Allah's Messenger replied, 'To bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, and that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.' The Beduin asked again, 'Who is your witness to your testimony?' The Messenger said, 'This tree beside the valley will bear witness.' " Ibn Umar says, "The tree cleft the earth shaking and came near to Allah's Messenger. He asked the tree three times to testify; each time it testified to his truthfulness. When Allah's Messenger ordered, it went back and settled down in its place." According to the authentic narration of Ibn Sahib al-Aslami, Burayda reports: "When we were together with Allah's Messenger on an expedition, a Beduin came and asked for a miracle. Allah's Messenger said, 'Tell that tree that Allah's Messenger summons her.' Then, when the Prophet pointed at a tree, it swayed and brought itself out with its roots, came to the presence of the Prophet saying, 'Peace be on you, O Messenger of Allah !'

Yes it is sad and horrendous that people have to suffer at the hands of others.  <br>  And while they are in the land of the living,  everything needs to be done to prevent them from doing such crimes.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Greg<br>  If we could earn our salvation and be justified by doing good works, then Jesus' sacrifice was for nothing.  Is that not the reason that Jesus suffered and died, so that we could be justified by faith?<br>  <br>  Romans 3:28 (NIV)<br>  28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. <br>  <br>  Galatians 3:24 (NIV)<br>  24 So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	Yawn!  I'm sorry.  How many times does this same question need to be asked before it sinks in?<br>  <br>  Salvation is by faith alone ... NO WORKS/DEEDS NEEDED!<br>  <br>  Eph. 2:8, 9  For by grace you have SAVED THROUGH FAITH, and that not of yourselves; it is the GIFT OF GOD,  9  NOT OF WORKS, lest anyone should boast.<br>  <br>  Rom. 11:6  And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.  But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer grace.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Heb 11:6 -- faith is indeed the minimum requirement without which we cannot please God. But this is just the beginning of the process leading toward justification. Faith alone does not justify a person. Justification is only achieved by faith and works, as we see below. Also, this gratuitous gift of faith from God also includes the grace of hope and love the moment the person is justified.<br>  <br>  Eph 2:8-9 -- Paul teaches us that faith is the root of justification, and that faith excludes "works of law." But Paul does not teach that faith excludes other kinds of works, as we will see below. The verse also does not say we are justified by "faith alone." It only indicates that faith comes first. This, of course, must be true, because those who do works outside of faith are in a system of debt, not of grace. But faith alone does not justify. A man is justified by works, and not by faith alone. James 2:24.<br>  <br>  James 2:24 -- the phrase "faith alone" (the Greek "pisteos monon") only occurs once in the Bible. "Man is justified by works and NOT by faith alone." Unlike what many churches teach, nowhere in Scripture does it say that man is justified or saved by "faith alone." To the contrary, man is not justified by faith alone according to Scripture. A person is justified by faith and works acting together, which comes solely from God's divine grace. Faith alone never obtains the grace of justification. Also, the word "justified" (dikaiow) is the same word Paul uses for justification in Rom 4:3 in regard to Abraham so one cannot argue James is not referring to "justification" in James 2:24 unless they argue Paul wasn't in Rom. 4:3 either.<br>  <br>  Eph 2:8-9 -- Paul teaches us that faith is the root of justification, and that faith excludes "works of law." But Paul does not teach that faith excludes other kinds of works, as we will see below. The verse also does not say we are justified by "faith alone." It only indicates that faith comes first. This, of course, must be true, because those who do works outside of faith are in a system of debt, not of grace (more on that later). But faith alone does not justify. A man is justified by works, and not by faith alone. James 2:24.<br>  <br>  Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38, 3:19, 17:30 -- the faith we have must be a repentant faith, not just an intellectual faith that believes in God. Repentance is not just a thought process (faith), but an act (work) by which we ask God for His mercy and forgiveness.<br>  <br>  Psalm 51:17 -- this means we need a "broken and contrite heart," not just an intellectual assent of faith. Faith in God is only the beginning.<br>  <br>  John 3:36; Rom 1:5, 6:17; 15:18; 16:26; 2 Cor 9:13; 1 Thess 1:3; 2 Thess 1:11; 1 Peter 2:7-8; Heb 5:9; cf. Rev 3:10; Exod 19:5 -- this faith must also be an "obedient faith" and a "work of faith." Obedience means persevering in good works to the end.<br>  <br>  2 Cor 10:15 -- this faith must also increase as a result of our obedience, as Paul hopes for in this verse. Obedience is achieved not by faith alone, but by doing good works.<br>  <br>  Gal 5:6 -- thus, the faith that justifies us is "faith working through love," not faith alone. Faith and love (manifested by works) are always connected. Faith (a process of thought) and love (an action) are never separated in the Scriptures. Cf. Eph 3:17; 1 Thess 3:6,12-13; 2 Thess 1:3; 1 John 3:23; Rev 2:4-5,19. Further, all faith (initial and perfected) are gratuitous gifts from God, and not earned or merited by any human action. God effects everything, both the willing and the achievement. But God also requires human action, which is necessary to perfect our faith.<br>  <br>  James 1:22-25 -- it's the "doers" who are justified, not the hearers. Justification is based on what we do, which means "works." Notice that there is nothing about "false faith." The hearers may have faith, but they need to accompany their faith by works, or they will not be justified.<br>  <br>  James 2:17,26 -- James clearly teaches that faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead. Works are a cause, not just an effect, of our justification because good works achieve and increase our justification before God. Scripture never says anything about "saving faith." No one can show us from the Scriptures that "works" qualify the "faith" into saving faith. Instead, here and elsewhere, the Scriptures teach that justification is achieved only when "faith and works" act together. Scripture puts no qualifier on faith. Scripture also never says that faith "leads to works." Faith is faith and works are works (James 2:18). They are distinct (mind and action), and yet must act together in order to receive God's unmerited gift of justification.<br>  <br>  James 2:19 -- even the demons believe that Jesus is Lord. But they tremble. Faith is not enough. Works are also required.<br>  <br>  James 2:20 -- do you want to be shown, you shallow man, that faith apart from works is barren. Good works in God's grace are required for justification. But there is nothing in the Scriptures about "saving faith."<br>  <br>  James 2:22 -- faith is active with works and is completed by works. It does not stand alone. Faith needs works to effect our justification.<br>  <br>  James 4:17 -- in fact, James writes that the failure to do works is a sin! So works are absolutely necessary for our justification.<br>  <br>  James 2:15-17 -- here are the examples of the "works" to which James is referring -- corporal works of mercy (giving food and shelter to those in need).<br>  <br>  James 1:27 -- another example of "works" is visiting orphans and widows in their affliction. Otherwise, if they do not perform these good works, their religion is in vain.<br>  <br>  James 2:25 -- another example of "works" is when Rahab assisted the spies in their escape. Good works increase our justification and perfect our faith.<br>  <br>  Joshua 2:9-11 -- Rahab's fellow citizens had faith in God, but in Joshua 6:22-25, Rahab alone acted and was saved. This is faith in action.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	In Romans 1:5 Paul talks about his call to preach the "gospel which leads to obedience." I believe that faith is like a 2-sided coin. True faith will always lead to obedience. A simple test for this is to ask yourself some questions. Am I trusting in God to provide for me? You say "yes, I have faith in God to provide."  Good, if this is true then you won't be disobeying  God's law by stealing. You cannot be stealing and truly be trusting God to provide. This is just one example. Hebrews 4 also shows this "2-sided coin" of faith/obedience. It speaks of how the Israelites never entered the promised rest .  Hebrews 3:19 says, "So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their UNBELIEF." And then in Hebrews 4:11 it says, "Let us make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of DISOBEDIENCE."  These are written in such a way that it is hardly detected, almost as though he used the same interchangeable word.  So I say, "No we are most definitely not saved by works or deeds or by the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. But the kind of faith that will save us is a faith that truly trusts in and relys on Him in such a way that it will lead to obedient works.|`|HZqi9XyJaa	We cannot be saved by good works alone.  We can only be saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. But it is by the works we "demonstrate" that we have faith. We don't do the works "to" be saved, We do them because we "are" saved, because we love Him. <br>  <br>  James 2 says:<br>  14 What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? <br>  15 Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. <br>  16 If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? <br>  17 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.<br>  18 But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." <br>  Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.<br>  19 You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.<br>  20 You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? <br>  21 Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? <br>  22 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," and he was called God's friend. <br>  24 You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.<br>  25 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? <br>  26 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	Good works give you JOY<br>  J = Jesus First<br>  O= Others second<br>  Y= yourself<br>  <br>  Works do not save you, what did Y'shua tell the rich young man, sell<br>  all you have, give to the poor & come follow me.<br>  The Works of YHWH God is that we should believe on His Son Messiah Y'shua & follow Him.

AA11668191	Ah, but any correction would have infringed upon the whole free will thing. Free will is about choice, and humans have the choice to do evil, so bad things happen. Biblically speaking, the world exists as a proving ground to see if there are any souls capable of following God without ever being forced to. Were the world perfect, there'd be no point to it, and all souls would be in heaven. There'd be nothing to prove. So the world "is good" because it allows for evil, not in spite of it.|`|YLW7cEjkaa	He knew, it just wasn't a good enough reason not to create us.

I am not an atheist, nor do I ever seek to bash Christianity as a whole; I merely take issue with poorly-behaved Christians because of the disproportionate influence they tend to wield.<br>  <br>  I think it is a good thing that Christians can asks these questions; too often we see many things taken as unquestionable within the club.<br>  <br>  I think that positing any omniscient, omnipotent, interventionist and benevolent single-god poses inherent logistical problems. I'd like to see the issue debated intelligently rather than people automatically reacting negatively.<br>  <br>  Of course, removing the interventionist aspect is the easiest, but it kinda makes participation in a religion for such a being problematic. The "why do bad things happen to good people/good things happen to bad people" dilemma remains an obstacle whenever an interventionist single-god is posited.<br>  <br>  peace.|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	This is the exact same question I have been asking for years.  You can even take it one step further and wonder why did god create Lucifer if he would have known that Lucifer would rebel against him.  Also your concept of free will is a little flawed.  Man was not originally created with free will.  God never intended us to have free will.  It was only after the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil was eaten that free will came into play.  How can you have free will with no concept of right and wrong??  You can't.  You cannot have the free will to choose between right and wrong if you have no concept or understanding of right and wrong.  God explicitly told Adam and Eve not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, so god never intended us to have free will.  However since Adam and Eve had no concept of right and wrong, and no concept of death, how could he have expected them to realize the consequence of their actions?  He set them up for failure on purpose.   Also you stated that it was irresponsible of god to continue with his creations once he realized there were flaws.  I will take this a step further and ask you how is it possible that a PERFECT creator make something with flaws in it?  Would not an all powerful omnipotent and omniscient god not only be incapable of making a mistake, but if he had indeed intended for his creations to be perfect would it not be impossible for them to be anything other than perfect?  The only explanation that can exist is that either god does not in fact exist, or that god is not all powerful, all knowing and perfect.  The only other option is that god did this on purpose and is a sadistic creator who enjoys watching the misery he has created and is in fact the evil one, and Satan is the good one for rising up against an egomaniacal and tyrannical creator.  Either way, I prefer to believe that god does not exist, because the concept of an inept creator, or an evil creator are just too much to handle, lol.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Yes He knew all the flaws of humanity beforehand - that is precisely why we needed our Savior Jesus CHrist - otherwise we would be eternally lost.

It's all part of the Plan|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO...Just as creation is a free act so is Atonement. He could have atoned by a quite different way.  <br>  <br>  Creation is inherently imperfect too !! The creature is limited and cannot even sustain its own being, as Paul says, quoting a Pagan :<br>  In Him we live and move and have our being. <br>  <br>  And the free will thing is the worst of your errors. God created out of love. He wanted it to stay good but He loved it nonetheless (Sounds like you would have shelved the whole damn thing -- Thank God, you aren't God ) so He perdures in the reason He created, Love. <br>  <br>  Your reading of Genesis is very bad. <br>  The Pentateuch as Narrative<br>  by John Sailhamer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Naturally speaking the fall of the angels would have happened BEFORE creation so perfection can't be the aim AND it probably happened because God revealed to the angels the plan of Incarnation and the response was "Damn, we have higher natures than they will, Why not incarnate as an Angel ?" -- So your data and reasoning are scary wrong.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Since you believe in Him, you already know He knew.<br>  <br>  So we have drama going on, and God is proud of His children who overcome.

They believe that education is the key (which is right) but it's a little obsessive. Although it is not as common now at one point the oldest son would take their parents in after they got married.

UWlRLXvRaa	Absolutely!! When we're slaves of Christ, we're free! What is bondage? Is it not looking to fulfill that inner longing for Christ in the stuff of earth? And most do this without realizing that at the heart of their addiction or desire is a longing for Jesus. That's why the church is always saying to the world like the Beloved in the Song of Solomon said, "Have you seen Him? Have you seen my Lover? Have you seen my Jesus?" He is everything! He's the only One that can satisfy the deepest longings of the soul! He's IT! It's not in pleasure or people or popularity or personality or posterity or power or politics or pranks or puns or possessions or property or prosperity or perception or principles, or philosophies or perspicacity or perspicuity or prestidigitation. NO! Life is in being a "Prisoner of the Prince of Peace"! Life is "in Christ"! That's where abundant life is!<br>  <br>  And to have Him abundantly we give up all to take hold of Him. Why? Because He gave up all to take hold of us! And He gives ALL of Himself to us and expects nothing less from us!

You already can establish that you two are prisoners because whatever land you choose there is nowhere else to go. Now the both of you look to your left and you see an island that has plenty of trees and fruit and shelter and no bad animals that can harm you. Then, you look to your right and you see an island that is desolate with a few good trees and has a few animals that can harm such as serpents. The left is the kingdom of God and the right is the kingdom of satan. Being a prisoner of God is liberty because of God's perfect being and the fact that He can give us many thing to the full of our hearts desire. Admitingly, most of us try to be perfectionist but come up short. God can take you from this sinful state and actually make you perfect. He has promised to do just this and God cannot lie. So being a prisoner of God with the sole belief that he will give you the judgement of everlasting life whether it will be in heaven or on a new earth it is still everlasting life(this is God's judgement to those who become His prisoner). Now to the right you have satan's kingdom(todays wicked world)which has convinced man that he can govern himself without the hand of God intervening. The island to the right is satans false promise that leads to destruction. Satan does not possess the authority to judge over you and I because he tried to make himself a god over God, that was an abomination and that eventually caused him to be cast out of heaven. Now, satan knows who God is and had a untouchable relationship with God. However, because of his own vanity and not wanting to follow God's plan he was cast out. Understand this, *** long as you live satan does not want you to have any kind of relationship with God because of his jealousy of God. From the day you were even formed God loved you and knew that satan would try to beguile you as he did our mother Eve so that's why He sent His holy spirit to reveal itself whether it be through dreams or talking to people on the street, this is what He has done. God only wants you to join His glorious kingdom and be His prisoner because when you get out your reward is plentious and great. Satan wants you to be his prisoner because he knows his time is short and as long as your a human being who he is jealous of because he sees you as less, he wants you to be his prisoner because his judgement awaits him and that's everlasting fire and he'll take anybody down with him, especially those who are forming a great relationship with the Father of our forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	In Ephesians 4:1, Paul calls himself a prisoner of the Lord.<br>  "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,"<br>  <br>  <br>  "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord"<br>  "Paul accepts his imprisonment as part of the plan of God for his life. He is not blaming anyone for his problems, least of all God. He considers this merely an event in his life. He knows that "all things work together for good for those who love God and are called..." During this imprisonment he wrote the mighty works of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon, indicating strongly that he was anything but defeated in very tough circumstances.      The word "therefore" refers to the previous chapters' teaching. In those chapters, the reader's attention is drawn to the importance of taking in the Word and becoming "rooted and grounded" in truth.     The impossible is accomplished through Grace. Through knowing God and His mind, the believer begins to see God and realize that God is able to do "exceedingly abundantly" above all that he can ask or think.    We are not really aware of the tremendous assets we have in Christ until we begin to see some of the principles of the Word applied to our lives. Then we develop the strong positive mental attitude that gives control and production the life."<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.realtime.net/~wdoud/ephesians/eph21.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realtime.net/~wdoud/ephesians...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|AA10674998	Circumstances do not change what someone is, they reveal what someone is. ... and so it is written that as Paul was imprisoned unjustly - there was not a Roman that Paul saw at the other end of his chain.<br>  <br>      Ephesians 3:1<br>      "... I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus..."<br>  <br>      Ephesians 4:1<br>      "As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you ."<br>  <br>      Philemon 1:9<br>      ". I then, as Paul–an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus"<br>  <br>  And so on.<br>  <br>  Where others saw a roman guard at the end of the chain, Paul saw someone different. Paul saw Jesus as the One imprisoning him, and he was happy to be wherever Jesus had him, whether on the open sea or in a dungeon - violating his Roman citizenship.<br>  <br>  So trouble comes your way, as it does for all. That trouble reveals something about the others that have neglected decency, but our reaction reveals us, and God is not interested in dealing with anyone else but ourselves with ourselves.<br>  <br>  Why try to change the circumstance by griping and shaming the offenders?<br>  Why not be changed by the circumstance and soften the heart by running to the Lord?<br>  <br>  Griping and grumbling is a false idol that I use to evoke a change or control those that make me uncomfortable. You can justify it all you want, but don't ask me to join you. There is no justification for me (or anyone else) to complain, for to do so is a complaint against Christ who holds the cosmos together with His might, and Who permits whatever circumstance that we might wish He would have prevented.|`|deqX4oQQaa	To me being a Prisoner to the Lord Jesus Christ( as in my lifetime was an actual prisoner in actual prisons in North Carolina) Showed me the pure power and Ultimate authority we as true believers have in Jesus Christ.

The religious blast away at us all the time on this site.<br>  <br>  Atheism is a religion like bald is a hair color.<br>  Atheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby.<br>  Atheism is a religion like OFF is a TV station.<br>  Atheism is a religion like vacuum is a gas.<br>  Atheism is a religion like creationism is a science.<br>  Atheism is a religion like not playing soccer is a sport.<br>  Atheism is a religion like nudity is an article of clothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  This isn't the "Religion site".  It's the Religion AND Spirituality site.  Religion isn't required to be spiritual.  And if you want to know why I'm here and why I care, it's because in the country that I live in, religion has infested the government.  When they legislate their religious beliefs, that's when I have a problem with it.

We took off for a few days and traveled from Santa Teresa di Gallura at the northern end  to Cagliari  at the southern end.  We made several stops on the way.  We were still several miles from Cagliari when we needed to stop for the night.  I saw a dirt road and drove down it a ways.  We found a hill overlooking a huge valley. We put up our tent for the night.  In the morning I heard a  3 wheeled pick up truck coming down the road. I flagged the driver down and asked if he knew who owned the land.  He did. I asked him how much I owed him for spending the night. He said to just clean up our tent site.  <br>  We continued on to Cagliari and when we got there, stopped for brunch.  I asked the cafe owner if there were any camp grounds. He said there weren't, but gave me directions to where people camped.  No showers, not toilets, no snack bars.  REALLY rough camping. We put up our tent, and on the pole for the awning I tied an American flag. Well we had all kinds of folks coming over to meet THE AMERICANS. We had a blast!  For 5 days we camped, played my guitar with other folks, sang songs, talked, swam, sunned.

What interests do you have?  <br>  <br>  Just get out there and talk to the ladies,who have the same interests as you do. That is a starting point.<br>  <br>  Gosh- I've had some good conversations get started at my local resale shops, while looking for sci-fi books.  Simple things like this can lead to "hey let's go get coffee" and so on....<br>  <br>  I think you should be looking for a possible wife now.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	It's such an individual and personal thing.  And really, if "burning" is the only thing motivating you to marriage, you should hold off.  Marriage is hard work and it works better if you're mature.  Maturity doesn't come at a specific age.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes when you are ready.|`|rb53GPZLaa	Stop looking for love-it tends to come along when you least expect it. Instead, concentrate on widening your circle of friends and meeting new people. The right age to marry is when you meet the right person and are committed to faithfulness to them until the end of your days. Look for friends first and love will follow.|`|MXYWSsM7aa	I remember a true to life love story about my pastor and his wife. He had the strong desire to look for a wife but the Lord spoke to him and told him to just focus on Him and that He would do the rest. So, he did. He stopped placing his desires in having a wife and just turned them to the Lord. Then one day he decided to take a walk. A couple of brothers saw him and joined in. They asked him where he was going and he said, "I don't know. I just feel a need to walk." They walked a couple of blocks north then a few blocks east and then Pastor decided to cross the street and head south. It was then that a couple of young women came running out of their duplex. They saw the three young men and yelled, "can you help us? Our kitchen sink pipes busted and there's water everywhere." Pastor, was working as a carpenter at the time and assisted them in fixing the problem. After wards the three brothers shared Christ with them and the two women accepted Christ as Savior. The next day Pastor walked the same route and knocked on the door at the duplex. One of the young women opened the door and he looked at her and said, "I'm going to marry you."  She looked at him and said, "I know." They got married 6 months later, had two children and are still happily married after 40 years. <br>  Keep your eyes on the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart. Just trust Him and wait on Him. <br>  God Bless. :)|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Twenty five is probably a good age but that won't be right for everyone. If you are a Christian ask God, through your prayers, to show you who is the right person for you. It could be someone you already know or someone you have not yet met but allow Him to lead the way.|`|r8qJecrMaa	Hold off until you are in your late eighties! You will then have gained most of the life-experience you need to raise your children to be good Christians!<br>  Hopefully by that time you will have run out of testosterone, your gonads would have shriveled and/or dropped off, and your wife would be well past the menopause!<br>  What a shame! No more little basta....sorry, Christians!|`|B1cvcAevaa	Nope, you said yourself you weren't ready in your twenties.<br>  <br>  Marry when you have found someone you feel is too good for you and she feels the same way about you.|`|Znw52fxkaa	Get married when you find someone to love.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	Little top do with age.   More to meeting the right person.|`|rIvp1BToaa	certainly  21  is a good age   I married at 19  and regret ed it  you need to be  mature  enough  as well|`|72bb74bb2c8a675ef9e2f4579eec2591aa	The Bible does not mention an age, however 1 Corinthians 7:36 does mention being 'past the bloom of youth'.  This suggests when you are mature and have learned not to be driven by your sexual feelings.<br>  <br>  My observation is that 25 is a good guideline for a minimum age.  I've seen successful marriages involving people younger than that, but they carry the appearance of boys struggling with their roles and girls coming to think they could have made a wiser choice.|`|ZeEx9eYeaa	Your such a sexist pig, i've seen your other posts.<br>  <br>  "burn" you mean you want to have sex. How sad you have to make it look like something disgraceful, you invent another word for it.<br>  <br>  You need to grow up, you can't marry a woman cos you fancy some sex. You should do it because you love her and want to spend your life with her and you respect her.<br>  <br>  I guess your going to be alone for a lot longer.
2OO9U8o9aa	It is quite common for a young guy for a young guy to have a crush on another guy and although they may not have seen each other for a long time the person will still be lodged in the memory bank <br>  How this guy then fits into the scenario you describe about the hospital is anybodys guess , but it could be you watched a  film or TV programme about hospitals and that too is set in your mind <br>  I had crushes on a number of friends when I was at school  and many years later I would still fantasise and dream about them , especially the ones where we did have some limited sexual encounter|`|UbvglIS6aa	Maybe you should contact him and see if this is one of those "real" dreams.|`|4Te5gVvDaa	It could be the upwelling of the archetypes. The brain possesses a conscious and an unconscious. That which may have been amongst your conscious could have receded into your collective unconscious. The collective unconscious is normally much larger then your conscious for it stores almost all data that you incur whether you remember or not. It's those memories that spark nostalgia. The unconscious has the ability to also formulate thought which is usually personified in dream. They are usually laden by our unconscious desires. You once insisted that he was a crush of yours. No one has a definitive on dreams but dreams often simulate our desires and especially those hidden in the unconscious. Haven't you  wondered why you would dream about random events in your childhood that you would not necessarily reminisce on or remember. It is the unconscious unsettling and settling. Some people however find a much more supernatural explanation for such.
jK5FXm6Naa	Lol I heard of a guy who stole a ladies handbag which had her mobile phone. The police phoned the mobile (which the criminal proceeded to answer) and informed him that he'd one the jackpot and to meet in the local village hall....now your wondering if he went, right? of course he did, and also brought the phone with him!|`|S2aHg67yaa	Because you never hear about the successful criminal, because the police don't catch him/her. The thing about the media is that it makes it sound like the police are winning a war against crime, when in fact that's a lie. When Police fail, they don't know about it.|`|v1JBAwSTaa	the clever criminals don't get caught..the dumbest criminals are the ones in wall street who the government is bailing out, using our money..|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Well if they were smart than they wouldnt be criminals. If they are smart than thats bad, thats when it gets scary when they're are criminal masterminds hanging around.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	only the stupid get caught!|`|AA11166769	It's probably because they're products of the modern educational system, which allows students to be mentally lazy.
AA10276327	It's been a while since I saw the movie, but the differences I remember are:<br>  <br>  A dam burst, instead of raining 40 days.<br>  Lumber was cut to measure and delivered<br>  The ark landed at the Capitol in Washington DC instead of Ararat<br>  Evan has to be convinced with birds unlike Noah<br>  The "voyage" lasted just a few minutes<br>  After the flood, Noah went out planted a vineyard and got drunk...Movie doesn't say.<br>  I don't remember if two birds were sent out by Evan at the end, but that would be another|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	I'm an atheist, and I suspect that most Christians and nearly all Jews recognize the Ark story as just an allegory rather than an actual occurrence.<br>  <br>  However- I loved Evan Almighty. The movie was funny, fun to watch and a veritable hoot.|`|AA12193600	none--they were both ficitional.  The biblical noah and the ark story was plagarized in large part from the much older sumerian epic of gilgamesh.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	One of them is just a story.<br>  The other has Steve Carell.|`|A9oWuOFBaa	The movie is more well-written.|`|XxWovDNCaa	No difference, they are both fairy tales. One modern, one ancient.|`|szsSPSmPaa	The movie is a Hollywood production.  The other is an ancient myth.
4wKmYKrKaa	i guess youre more fresh at the height of your career and these people have all reached and surpassed that point. But in cases of non-comedians i think some people get boring and complacent with their lives and lose that childish quality that i think we should all keep|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Let's also look at the other end of the spectrum:  Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson , Pauly Shore (remember him?),  Will Ferrell...I wouldn't give a nickle for ALL of these guys.  <br>  In fact, Hugh Grant is funnier than all of them put together.  So is George Clooney!|`|nnwbxPKfaa	I think we get less silly and willing to make a fool of ourselves as we get older. Nobody can stay on top of the game forever and those guys just aren't fresh any more. Each generation is a little more sophisticated than the last so even if we went back and looked at all of these guys in their prime we probably wouldn't think they were as funny.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	I don't think we get less funny.  Older comics may stick with their fan base and in doing so may not seem as funny as contemporary comics to younger people.  They stick with what is profitable to them, and what appeals to their base audience that is from an older generation.|`|Pdex43zgaa	I'm not part of the We you mention.<br>  I think some people get funnier as they grow older and some don't. Everyone is unique not part of a generic group.|`|sQqGpRXtaa	The body gets older the personality stays as daft and childlike as it has always been.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	Yeah...I guess sometimes we do....but I think I'm pretty hilarious sometimes :).

Hinduism is the oldest religion historians have tracked back so far, so you can't look at statistics on this one.|`|d265DZbHaa	Probably Hinduism|`|32a92bbbf2d5ea9f7044c21f8c89eb63aa	The worlds oldest religion that is still in practice today is Hinduism.|`|TpaCvakdaa	Morality and goodness
xnd99EX4aa	True dat to all you said. In addition, there are a lot of kids who fantasize being tough, rich, dangerous, mysterious, sexy, popular, and idolized. Gangsta rap speaks to all those desires and it's easy for a kid to glamorize this fantasy. I think thats why it's so popular. I used to be really concerned about the effect it has on our youth. As amatter of fact I was pissed off about the whole thing. After looking at the rap generation for such a long time, I've come to realize it's no more harmful than a kid fantazising about being Jesse James or a James Cagney gangster character. <br>  Thanks for your question. You made some good points.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I think that some whites really do like gangster rap.  I like rap.  I support any music that makes me want to shake my @ss :).

l7KNCARGaa	Neither!  A socialist country means the people depend on the government to take care of them, rather than taking care of themselves.  A theocracy government, means the government tells the people who/what to worship.<br>  <br>  I'd like America to remain strong and the way it's founding fathers formed it, thanks!<br>  <br>  God bless,<br>  <br>  Mrs. S.|`|hiCSVwchaa	You could easily have a socialist theocracy...<br>  <br>  ETA:  Actually, considering the way Iran doles out its oil profits, I'm pretty sure it is a socialist theocracy.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	What is the 2nd thing Jesus taught us to pray for in the Lord's Prayer?<br>  <br>  After asking for God's name to be known and honored, it was for God's Kingdom to come rule on earth as it is in heaven.<br>  <br>  The difference between a theocracy and all other forms of governments (socialist, democracy, Republics, etc.) is God as Ruler who actually has the knowledge and power to correct all the things wrong with the earth--both planet and people.  As Ecclesiastes 8:9 tells us, "man has dominated man to his injury."  Jeremiah 10:23 informs why.  "It does not belong to man to direct his steps."  Man was never supposed to rule ourselves.  History has demonstrated to all of us just how true this is.<br>  <br>  Humans do not possess the power or the knowledge to solve anything without making an even bigger mess each time we try.|`|28yMpUfSaa	As a Christian, I am a pacifist.<br>  <br>  As a pacifist, I do not vote, or participate in any other use of force. See Mark 10, Romans 12, etc. Theocracy has generally referred to some form of rulership. I oppose rulership. Mark 10 again. Socialism, however refers to economic arrangements, many of which can exist without rulership. (anarchism includes several of these.)|`|macZI2dzaa	Christians (the pilgrims) tried a political theocracy and it was economically socialist .  About 1/2 of them died the first winter. <br>  We generally prefer capitalism economically and a representative democracy politically.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	As a Christian, I don't accept those choices.<br>  <br>  In a democracy no one is repressed. Each one of us is free to believe what we want, and we are free to practice our religion.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	How are the People in Norway, Sweden, Germany, Britain, Canada, and other socialized democracies more repressed than Americans?|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	I take it that we have to choose one extreme or another, and no option for a modified version of either. <br>  <br>  I'm a Fundamentalist Christian and would not want a theocracy; primarily because it would not work in the way that the supporters would want. And, I don't know of any Christian who wants a true theocracy. I see two basic problems with this style of government. A) it requires a forced agreement to a certain belief. Forcing someone does not change their heart. and B) What moral standards and laws would we uphold. When you consider how diverse even Christianity is, it would be difficult to gain the support that it fits all Christians. So, even many of the Christians would find things that are objectionable. <br>  <br>  Now, as to a socialist country...it sounds great in many aspects. But, after working in unionized facilities and seeing people who are the weakest players getting the same perks as the ones who do all of the work, it has its limitations as well. (Talk to the high seniority people in a plant, and they know that they have a certain invincibility in terms of layoffs or bidding, simply because they put in more time). <br>  <br>  Do I want a system where those who need help can get it? Yes. I've seen far too many people who fall through the system in terms of assistance, so we need more options. <br>  <br>  So, no thanks. The system right now is the lesser of the evils.|`|NmJnQ0qZaa	I get the feeling the prefer the Theocracy.  It gives them the double edge sword of ruling/controlling through both government and religion...which has really been the aim of Christianity since Constantine perverted it to do just that.<br>  The idea of socialism (although mostly failed in all attempts) is that the needs of the people will be provided by the government.<br>  The idea of Theocracy is simply to destroy diversity.|`|2hX0tLzIaa	"Since the majority of people in North America are Christian and live in a democracy it is obvious that they have the government they want."<br>  <br>  Really<br>  <br>  explain then how George Bush got into power yet everyone seem to complain about him

I don't think, however, that it would be quite the same in an unregulated forum.<br>  <br>  To look at that differently, I went to a bar for a drink only to discover that my usual bartender had been fired.

In any case, since it's for a newspaper, then they don't necessarily need any permission anyway, since you're not a celebrity that can profit on your likeness, and it's for a news-related purpose.  <br>  <br>  They could decide to attack you in the article, and they would have an arguable defense to defamation claims since your founding of this "Church of Atheism" could be considered by a court to make you a public figure.  It might make them look like ignorant jerks, especially from your perspective, but you might be surprised how many people in this country are more than willing to look like ignorant jerks in order to promote their religious beliefs.|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	You can send a notice to her that you  did not give her permission. <br>  <br>  Remember that "balanced reporting" is in the eye of the writer and reader, and can mean two very different things.|`|FnCvyXVDaa	"Church of Atheism", now I've heard everything.

DWwv3v9Raa	If you are in a committed relationship, then you have no need to go elsewhere, if you need to spice up the sexual side of the relationship then the two partners should discuss ways bringing the excitement back in it that doesn't involve other people. getting involved with other people can only lead to bigger problems down the road.|`|863D1b94aa	Well..I have never had a relationship till now...but I bet..I won't be tired of having emotional relationship with a person..but if its sexual..then show me one gay/straight or a bi guy who won't be tired??|`|4KNESOnlaa	I love being a long term relationship with my b/f I just wish my b/f wasn't such a @hole all the time and that he had a sex drive....  :  (|`|usIma0vIaa	I am single have troule finding a partner<br>  no<br>  no.|`|aYqCb3olaa	no not if I truly love someone,<br>  Then I could never get tired<br>  of waking up beside them<br>  each morning :]|`|76834697406f46fddc8a871d4856248baa	No; as a faithful husband, I don't get tired of "relations with the same person" because I know there are ways to please my wife that I haven't even tried yet.  I'm always learning something new, and to say I'm tired -- I will admit sometimes I'm frustrated -- of relating to one person implies I'll never be satisfied with anybody.  And that's not true.|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	Sometimes I think I do, but if I am really serious about the person I'm with, I don't need anyone else. I am in no way the cheater kind.

n3SdFlDKaa	Yeah u probably are a lesbian.<br>  I like women features. and yes i touch my friends **** for fun lol<br>  & theres nothing wrong with that.

Not have sex with strap ons and stuff. I want to go down on her and touch her boobs, but I don't think I could ever fall in love with another girl. I don't find penises attractive. If I saw a naked girl and a naked guy I'd get more turned on by the girl...I like the way or parts down there look and I look at mine a lot in the mirror, and at other girls' on porn. I've never felt the need to look at a penis, but in real life I do get attracted to guys not girls.. I'm 17"<br>  <br>  Then I'd say you fit that definition perfectly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a side note many women find male genitalia unatractive, as well as their own. i understand the alater is not applicable in your case. I once heard an interesting saying that might be of some use to you but I'm not sure if it applies. "Sexuality isn't who you have sex with, it's who you fall in love with." I find it interesting. Personally i think it's the exact opposite if we were to use it as a general guiding principle. But I think it can also be the case that there is a mix of tese at different phases of our life and the important thing is just to reconcile it all with our own sence of dissonance and conscience and make a sincere effort to look out for the interest of ourselves and others - always.|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Maybe your bisexual. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm 23 and have been with my boyfriend for 2 years now and i have been with other girls but it was purely a sexual thing. I know the feeling of being turned on my women but you can't see yourself having a real relationship with them or getting married. You feel sexually aroused by women and thats totally fine. It's just a sexual thing and it might even be a stage that you're going through. Embrace it and dont ever be ashamed of who you are.|`|VqBQygR6aa	No,you're not.you just enjoy the physical part of a woman.your just a little kinky.=].but maybe you are.just take time to really think about what you want.

jU7FwOGgaa	i am an Asian , and in our culture it is a shame to see a man crying except when there is a funeral.i don't understand why , but it is always been that way from generation. i never saw my dad cry neither my brothers.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	This is a European maybe also Asian cultural value, In fact I believe the Mediterranean area is much less invested in this.  The are several other cultures that do not put this artificial rule on boys.  In our(American) male dominated society for some reason men are perceived as diminished in their person and male identity if they are too free with their emotions, not just crying but expressing love, vulnerability,fear. The female as dependent and subservient is just as ridiculous, however if a woman is too smart, to athletic,too self sufficient, or too independent she is seen as unfeminine, unattractive, and like the emotional male she is often perceived as alternative lifestyle oriented. culture is not always easily explainable and sometimes the reason our customs are the way they are reaches so far back in time there is no way to check for sure exactly why it is.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	There is nothing wrong for a man to cry.<br>  Sensitivity is not just a quality for women; there are some women who are not sensitive at all while there are some men that are sensitive by nature. <br>  The idea that women=emotions and men=ration is all BS and society influenced. <br>  Because most people regardless of sex are a mixture.<br>  I'm a female and I sure as hell don't cry all the time.|`|WseLyvSpaa	I don't think it IS taboo for men to cry.  As long as we're not blubbing over every little thing.  It is perfectly manly or womanly to cry at a funeral or an event of great emotional weight.  As long as you are under control and could still pay the bar tab or stop a small bedside table from dropping on your head while drying your tears.  Crying to the point of incapacity is not cool. At a movie?  Maybe... But NOT at work, or in the car during the morning commute.  Then it does mean that you are either a sissy or are having a nervous breakdown. That goes for men and women.<br>  <br>  Crying IS a sign of weakness!  It means that you are OVERCOME with emotion.  There is nothing wrong with that, but it does handicap you.<br>  <br>  Buck Up, you snivelling cowards!|`|67EaIAvbaa	taboo?...GOD gave us tears....and please be extremely cautious on training your child when to cry and when not to,males cry to you know...Were human..we hurt..and we have feelings just like the female..it doesn't make us weak...good luck.<br>  <br>  i have to put this in.....when he cries...maybe he just needs a hug.|`|d8zxbKduaa	Probably because people think it is a sign of weakness and men are supposed to be big and strong.|`|AA10604976	It isn't.<br>  <br>  Why perpetuate the taboo if you don't like it?|`|aaRMPDIDaa	A lot of men think that crying is a sign of weakness.  I know everytime I see a man cry, I feel so bad, like something must really be wrong if a man is crying...but on the other hand, I have seen all of my ex's cry (I was a bit of a heartbreaker when I was a youngin').<br>  <br>  I think its healthy for men to let out a good cry every now and then.  This world can be really f-ed up, and sometimes all you can do is cry.  A real man isn't afraid to cry.|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	Because most people view crying as weak and emotional.  We are taught that men do not have emotions when in fact, they do.  If something bothers a person, whether male or female, and crying feels good- then who cares.  <br>  <br>  That's why women try not to cry at work in front of their boss or co workers.  Because most people just view it as a weakness when someone cries over something (other than something that has happened that is tragic- death, illness, etc).|`|8auEgQf2aa	I actually literally couldn't cry for 2 or 3 years and boy that was hard times for me the men out there who can cry should do it im lucky I can cry again lol but I hardly do unless I know someone whos died<br>  i cry behind closed doors in private lol feels good afterwards|`|jeYyydb0aa	I actually find it physically impossible to cry.

There was no such thing in existence at the time.  The first paintings were not done until 1500 some odd years after he died.  None of the painters knew what Jesus looked like.<br>  <br>  Jesus was human.  God has never been human.  At least we know Jesus did have a physical body with face, hands, feet and the rest.  We can know what skin tones he was born in to.

XLXncQu9aa	The main advantage of not doing harm to someone that has done it to you is that you won't have to deal with guilt for the rest of your life. Even though what they did was wrong, if you walk away from that situation knowing that you did not succumb to their levels, then you can keep your dignity and respect. The person that did the wrong doings to you, will have to deal with the guilt for the rest of their lives.  Secondly, it says that you are willing to forgive and forget.  Forgiveness is something that is rare in today's society.  If you can forgive that person you have already won the battle.  It means that the person who wronged you does not have power and control over you.  So in essence you are free from their control.  They don't control you emotionally and they don't control you mentally.  Its better to be free from someone's control rather than be bound by it.|`|AA11166769	Well, for starters, you don't go to jail!:)|`|AA11603468	I'd actually wonder what is the benefit of hurting someone.

Many belief cults spread stories and myths probably handed down by oral tradition from generation to generation before people wrote them down. Many of the stories originally came from Egyptian and Sumerian cults. All of these early religions practiced polytheism, including the early Hebrews. Some of the oldest records of the stories that later entered the Old Testament came from thousands of small cylinder seals depicting creation stories, excavated from the Mesopotamia period. These early artifacts and artworks (dated as early as 2500 B.C.E.) established the basis for the Garden of Eden stories a least a thousand years before it impacted Hebrew mythology.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, there existed many competing Christian cults in the early years after Jesus' alleged death. Some sects saw the universe in dualisms of goodness and sin, of light and darkness, God and the Devil. Other Christian sects performed odd rituals, some of which involved the swallowing of semen, thought of as a sacred substance. Many other Christians also wrote mystical stories and by the second century there existed more than a dozen Gospels, along with a whole library of other texts. These include letters of Jesus to foreign kings, letters of Paul to Aristotle, and histories of the disciples. In one of these secret Gospels, it describes Jesus taking naked young men off to secret initiation rites in the Garden of Gethsemene. There lived Christian Gnostics (knowers) who believed that the church itself derived from the Devil to keep man from God and from realizing his true nature. In those first centuries of Christianity orthodoxy did not exist and when an organized orthodox church finally came, it got defined, almost inadvertently, in argument against many of the Gnostic sects.<br>  <br>  So the idea of the Bible as a single, sacred unalterable corpus of texts began in heresy and later extended and used by churchmen in their efforts to define orthodoxy. One of the Bible's most influential editors, Irenaeus of Lyon, decided that there should only exist four Gospels like the four zones of the world, the four winds, the four divisions of man's estate, and the four forms of the first living creatures - the lion of Mark, the calf of Luke, the man of Matthew, and the eagle of John. In a single stroke, Irenaeus had delineated the sacred book of the Christian church and left out the other Gospels. Irenaeus also wrote what Christianity did not include, and in this way Christianity became an orthodox faith. A work of Irenaeus, Against the Heresies, became the starting point for later inquisitions.<br>  <br>  There has existed over a hundred different versions of the Bible, written in most of the languages of the time including Greek, Hebrew and Latin. Some versions left out certain biblical stories and others contained added stories. The completed versions of the old and new testament probably got finished at around 200-300 C.E. although many disputed the authenticity of some books which later ended up as Apocrypha (uncanonical or of questionable authorship). For example, the book of Ecclesiasticus appears in the Catholic Bible but not in Protestant versions.<br>  <br>  At around 405 C.E. Jerome (Eusebius Hieronymous) finished translating all the Old and New testament books into Latin (Vulgate Bible) which provided the Roman Catholic church added power. The Vulgate Bible went through several revisions up until the early 1900s!<br>  <br>  The salvation doctrines of Christianity survived and flourished because they afforded the priesthood considerable power. The priests alone held the keys to salvation and could threaten the unbelievers with eternal punishment. Hence, in the evolution of Christianity in the last two thousand years with priests preying on human fears, the religion has demonstrated extraordinary powers of survival. Even without the priests, the various versions of the Bible have had more influence on the history of the world, in the minds of men than any other literature.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the beliefs in Scripture produced the most violent actions against man in the history of humanity up to that time. The burning of competing Christian cults (called heretics) by early Christian churches acted as the seeds of violent atrocities against man. There later followed the destruction of Rome by the Christian Goths, and the secret pagan sacrifices consented by the Pope, the Vandals that had the Bible with them as they destroyed imperial North Africa, the crusades in the eleventh century fighting in the lands around the eastern Mediterranean, Palestine and Syria, capturing Jerusalem and setting kingdoms from Anatolia to the Egyptian border. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade plundered Constantinople the most holy city at that time, with Christians fighting Christians. And the slaughters continued (and continues to this day). According to Romer, "More heretics and scholars were burned in the Middle Ages than were ever killed in Carolingian times. For at this time the Inquisition came into its own, and torture, largely unused as an instrument of government since Roman days, was reintroduced."<br>  <br>  In the 1380s, John Wycliffe translated the first English Bible which inspired an English religious revolution which caused persecutions against him by the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  In the early 1500's the German heretic, Martin Luther, almost single handedly caused the final split from the Roman Catholic church and created the beginnings of the Protestant revolution. This split still influences violence to this day. He translated the Bible into German which further spread Protestantism. Luther also helped spread anti-Semitism with his preaching and books such as his "The Jews and their lies," all supported through his interpretation of the Bible. One should not forget that Hitler (a Christian and great admirer of Luther) and his holocaust could not have occurred without his influence and the support of Bible believing German Christians.<br>  <br>  In the 1530s William Tyndale completed his version of the English Protestant Bible (probably with the aid of Luther) and the first to print the English Bible. He too felt the persecution of the Church and he spent his last days in imprisonment and exile. His enemies finally caught him and burned him at the stake, but because of his celebrity, they strangled him first (what nice guys!).<br>  <br>  After Luther's German Bible, others followed suit by translating the Bible into their native languages including Dutch and French. Not until 1611 C.E. did a committee of translators and interpreters complete the most popular Bible of all time, the King James Version.<br>  <br>  Today we still have dozens of Bible translation versions, with Bible scholars still arguing over the meaning and proper translations of words and phrases. The following shows just a few of the most popular versions:<br>  <br>  King James Version (KJV) <br>  The New King James Version (NKJV) <br>  Modern King James Version [Green's Translation] (MKJV) <br>  Literal Translation Version [Green] (LITV) <br>  International Standard Version (ISV) <br>  The New International Version (NIV) <br>  English Standard Version (ESV) <br>  New English Bible (NEB) <br>  American Standard Version (ASV) <br>  New American Standard Bible (NASB) <br>  Revised Standard Version (RSV) <br>  New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)  Contemporary English Version (CEV) <br>  Today's English Version (TEV) <br>  The Living Bible (LB) <br>  New Century Version (NC)<br>  New Life Version (NLV) <br>  New Living Translation (NLT) <br>  Young's Literal Translation (YLT) <br>  Revised Young's Literal Translation (RYLT) <br>  John Darby's New Translation <br>  Weymouth New Testament Translation <br>  Rotherham's  <br>  <br>  (One might wonder what will happen to the "new" revisions a few hundred years from now. Nevertheless, the King James Version still remains the most used Bible in the world today and it will probably continue its popularity long into the future.)<br>  <br>  No doubt that future versions of Bibles will surface in the future: revisions of previously revised Bibles and newer revisions of new versions. The history of the many versions of the Bible stories, from the ancient Mesopotamian myths to the varied interpretations, interpolations, and versions of the Bible speaks volumes about the reliability of their interpretations and the alleged "truth" they claim the Bible holds, because it shows that the Bible comes not from supernatural agents but rather from human imagination. We have not one shred of evidence for the supernatural influence on human written works (and mostly from unknown authors), but we do have an abundance of evidence for human recorded beliefs and myths. This shows a marked difference between those of scientific works and those deriving from religious minds. For example, Euclid's Elements written around 300 B.C.E. has changed little since its inception. Scientists don't argue and debate about its meaning because they know it doesn't represent an absolute or fixed work. It only provides a step in the understanding of geometry. Most Christian apologists, on the other hand, view the Bible as fixed and absolute, if only they could only just get the interpretation correct. But regardless of how much they want the Bible to reflect their particular beliefs, they can never dislodge the violence and atrocities described and condoned by their God in the stories in the Old Testament. Nor can they dismiss the even more horrific result of the horrors of Hell as amplified by the words of the alleged Jesus in the New Testament where almost everyone on earth dies in eternal fire. In short, Bible belief influences horror, not by the majority but by the few that actually believe in its macabre prophecy and have the power to force their |`|Lrp7673Caa	Christianity…the belief that some cosmic Jewish zombie will grant you immortality, if you ‘symbolically’ eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can rid an evil imbedded in mans soul because some rib woman was tricked into eating a magic apple by a talking snake…yeah makes perfect sense|`|ucuP0boCaa	There is no god.

In my 35(off and on) years of serving My Father, God has always dealt with me in a straightforward manner.  He says what He means in His word and make no apologies for it and that is how he has handled me.  I ask, he answers.   So, in my opinion, yes His messages are clear. -Once this is achieved---Now as to how we are to perceive, and wonder if we are getting God's take on things-the fruit that it bears shows whether we understood the message correctly or not.  Also, a certain amount of faith is required for all interaction with God. Faith that God is the one that is actually relaying information to you.  Its really all about learning the voice of God through our ups and downs and watching what becomes of listening to that voice.<br>  <br>  Love. Let Live.

If he does, then the messages don't need to be clear - just enough information for us to take further on our own.  If he doesn't, then he's written a pretty poor instruction manual (IMHO).<br>  <br>  Either way, our perception of something has little relevance to its truth - religious or otherwise.  Just look at the whole "world is flat" perception, or, for something a little more timely, how about "There are WMDs in Iraq".

Uncertain about which way will lead him to his destination, he asks passersby for directions but receives conflicting information. Confused, he is unable to go on. Having doubts about our beliefs can have a similar effect on us. Such uncertainty can interfere with our ability to make decisions, causing us to be unsure of the way in which to walk.<br>  <br>  2 A situation arose that could have had such an effect on some people in the Christian congregation in first-century Corinth, Greece. “Superfine apostles” were challenging the authority of the apostle Paul, saying: “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible.” (2?Corinthians 10:7-12; 11:5,?6) Such a viewpoint may have caused some in the Corinthian congregation to be unsure of how to walk.<br>  <br>  3 Paul founded the congregation in Corinth during his visit there in 50?C.E. He stayed in Corinth “a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.” Indeed, “many of the Corinthians that heard began to believe and be baptized.” (Acts 18:5-11) Paul was keenly interested in the spiritual welfare of his fellow believers in Corinth. Moreover, the Corinthians had written Paul for advice on certain matters. (1?Corinthians 7:1) So he gave them very fine admonition.<br>  <br>  4 “Keep testing whether you are in the faith,” Paul wrote, “keep proving what you yourselves are.” (2?Corinthians 13:5) Applying this counsel would have protected those brothers in Corinth from being uncertain about the way in which to walk.

mOWyzwubaa	The writing of traditions had commenced in the lifetime of the Messenger of AllahSWT. The times when his conferees were not privileged to have his company, they asked and listened to others, who were present in his respected company, It has it from Hazrat Omar, who said, ‘Me and my neighbor took turns every day, to have the august company of the Messenger of AllahSWT (they lived in an area called Banu Umayya bin Zaid, a little distance from Masjid e Nabvi). Then we narrated to each other, whatever we went through each day. (Sahih Bokhari) As there were also hypocrites among them, so the confereesR listened to those whom they considered trustworthy. These hypocrites spread rumors about Messenger, and indulged in prate and gossip and also mixed with Muslims. It was difficult to distinguish them in the early years. Apparently it seems, that even God was compelled to warn and address His Messenger:  <br>  <br>  “Some people in Medina are bent on splitting you, you knoweth not, we knoweth!” (9/101)<br>  <br>  However, the Messenger himself had emphatically said, as to not to write about his sayings and deeds. That is why, during the lifetime of Messenger we find very few traditions and those that we do have, are of little significance. As for his followers, since they had been deprived of their most beloved leader, so during leisure time when three or four of them got together, they recalled the Messenger’s activities and refreshed their memories. Later we find contradictory statements among his disciples, because of which, the first Caliph, Hazrat Abu BakrR imposed a complete ban on the writing of Ahadith. He called them together and said:<br>  <br>              “You squabble among yourselves over hadith, this habit will increase as time goes by. Do not, therefore, narrate any saying of Messenger. If anyone wants to know, you can tell him the Quran is there between you and him. Whatever is allowed ought to be done, and refrain from what has been prohibited in the Quran.” (T’zakr tul Hifaaz)<br>  <br>  Inspite of this prohibition, we find people continued with hadith, it was not considered… as a crime! The second Caliph also tried to put a ban on hadith writing—Qarza bin Ka’ab has it that once they commenced their journey for Iraq. Hazrat Omar accompanied them till a place called Sira’ar, upon reaching there he inquired from them, “Do you know why I have come with you this far?” We replied, “For our welfare and in our honor!” He said, “Yes! And also that you are going, where the voice of Quran echoes like honeybees. Do not involve those people in Ahadith, and stop them from the Quran or narrate any traditions to them.” Qarza says, after that day, they did not remember narrating any hadith again. (Jama ul Biyaan)<br>  <br>  Farooq e Azam (title of Hazrat Omar) was so strict when it came to hadith, when he saw Abi bin Qa’ab narrating Ahadith, he went after him with his big cane. (T’zakr tul Hifaaz) Once Abu Salma asked Abu HurairaR who was famous for telling hadith, “Did you narrate Ahadith in the same way, during the reign of Hazrat Omar.” He replied, “If I had done so, he would have physically scolded me.” (Quoted by Al Sheikh Zahir bin Saleh) Hazrat Omar had no reservations at all, in matters of hadith, even for Messenger’s conferees. He reprimanded Hazrat Abdullah bin Masood, Abul Durda and Abu Zahry, as to why they narrated the traditions of Muhammad? He then put all three under house arrest in Medina and did not let them out for as long as he lived. The third Caliph, Hazrat Othman did not pay any heed to hadith or traditions. Once Hazrat Ali's son came to Hazrat Othman with a script of command by Muhammad, about zakat. Hazrat Othman, asked to be excused! (quoted by Al Sheikh Azhir bin Saleh).<br>  <br>  The fourth Caliph, Hazrat Ali also forbade people from hadith. And if anyone, narrated a hadith in front of him, he took an oath from that person, as to what he was saying was true. He often advised as not to narrate any hadith of which they did not know. As this habit of hadith would lead to disregarding the Messenger, which surely they all did not want.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Why is not more than 10 Hadith, narrated by Imam Ali(AS) and the Ahlulbayt(AS) exist in the 6 sunni authentic hadith books, which contain tens of thousands of narrations from men who hated Ali (AS) and fought against him?<br>  <br>  ======<br>  Well, anything I say is a shia lie to you...<br>  <br>  yeah I know there was lots of Narrations from Ali. <br>  But how many can you show me that say exactly the whole name "Narrated by Ali Ibn Abu Talib", Not "Narrated by Ali"?|`|mVSC9aKoaa	Taqiya secret order.|`|e3PWZYsAaa	yep<br>  <br>  Islam has the best........<br>  <br>  the Holy Quran<br>  <br>  THE ONLY Sahih book<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  just because Shias don't lable their books as "sahih" it doesn't mean anything bad......<br>  ......infact it shows we d NOT compae the word of Allah SWT with the word of man<br>  <br>  <br>  tell me something.......<br>  ......was bukhari more knowledgable or Imam Ali (as)?<br>  <br>  even a 3 year old could answer this question.......<br>  <br>  but still, Shias don't lable Nahjul Balaghe as "Sahih"........<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  well not knowing the authenticity is not the only thing you don't know........<br>  Nahjul Balaghe doesn't need any chain to see where what came from and who said it.......<br>  it's the work of Imam Ali (as), all the things that he had writen himself........<br>  <br>  <br>  Nahjul Balaghe is what Imam Ali (as) had writen.......<br>  ......bukhari is what he had heard people saying<br>  <br>  so tell me, which one is more authentic......<br>  what Imam Ali (as) has writen himself.....<br>  ........or what bukhari had heard from random people?|`|AA10873763	Reliable sources of information and religion don't mix.<br>  If they had reliable information, they wouldn't be religions, they would be science.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	I wouldnt consider any Shiee book a reliable source since they make undue claims to their imams as infallible,,|`|E0WUtePYaa	i was wondering that you should not spend your little brain in figuring out sectarian differences anymore

This book is divided into three sections of Sermons, Letters and short Sayings. Some of the sayings have been selected from the Sermons and Letters. <br>  Late Syed Radi compiled Nahj-ul-Balagha over a thousand years ago and before he made the efforts these jewels were scattered all over the Islamic literature. Other scholars were in the process of doing the same thing, but God gave Syed Radi the opportunity and the will to finish this enormous task. According to him certain words and expressions of Nahj-ul-Balagha are matchless in human expression by eloquent writers, Islamic thinkers and even the adversaries of Islam. These people have always accepted that some statements of the Nahj-ul-Balagha are superior to human expression and beyond the ordinary level of the human being's knowledge at that time. We are indebted to the endeavors and initiatives of Syed Radi who left the Nahj-ul-Balagha for us.<br>  <br>  The Sermons included in Nahj-ul-Balagha were expressed and written by Amir-al-Momeneen(as) as a teacher, ruler and an Islamologist.

Do what you can to make sure you can take care of yourself, and if you have family, do your best be able to provide for them.  So yes, I am hopeful, but I worry for those around me.

S5H0NmEWaa	Sort of. There's no denying that the United States is the world's most powerful nation, so any relationship with it - special or otherwise - will have a power imbalance. But there are deep historical and cultural ties between the UK and the USA, which over the years have translated to a similar (though not identical) political worldview.<br>  <br>  The UK has now and then been unafraid to break with the United States. Harold Wilson steadfastly refused to get involved in Vietnam, despite the pleadings of Lyndon Johnson. When the US invaded Grenada in 1983, Margaret Thatcher famously telephoned Ronald Reagan to give him a prolonged ear-bashing about invading a Commonwealth country. And in 1994, when the Americans granted a visa to the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, John Major refused to take Bill Clinton's phone calls for two days. So there are instances when the relationship is properly tested - it's not always that of poodle and master, even if it has felt that way for a prolonged period under Blair and Bush.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It's not really that surprising. <br>  The US would not exist without Britain.

kbYjkh45aa	Regardless of wherever you learnt your Spanish from -the Americas or Europe- it will be considered Spanish language and therefore understood anywhere it is spoken.  There is no impacting difference, nor should one be considered better than the other- it is a regional difference, at best.<br>  <br>  I will admit, though, that there are words that can stumble you in daily conversation such as the example you just gave.  To begin with, I believe 'traernos' is a grammatically incorrect form of 'traer' (according to the Real Academia Espa?ola, or R.A.E.)- yet everyday I see the word used and understood in both sides of the Atlantic.  The only thing I see different is how it aids the sentence constructed to have a different emotion implied over what's originally being said.  Example:<br>  <br>  ?Nos puede traer agua, por favor?<br>  (Can you bring us some water, please? - sounds singular in request, and warm in approach)<br>  <br>  as opposed to:<br>  <br>  ?Puede traernos agua, por favor?<br>  (Can you bring us all some water, please? - sounds plural in request, somewhat more commanding and drier a remark than the first)<br>  <br>  Either way, both Spaniards and Latin-Americans should understand what you are asking for without major conflicts.<br>  <br>  Also consider, that just like your friend Mark (from "Coffee Break Spanish"), he even uses words and phrases that may seem 'unconventional' to us Americans yet he retains his meaning.  In one lesson I just heard from his site, he says: "...enseguida means straight away!" In the U.S., we usually say 'right away!'- not 'straight away'.  So those kind of differences is what you would expect to encounter if you go to Spain to practice your Spanish.<br>  <br>  Finally, not all influences to the 'regional' difference in Spanish should be attributed to just native and African languages.  Our own English language (the most proximate to each form of Spanish) injects itself into the words that are used in its vocabulary.  For example, the word 'abordar' in Latin-American Spanish means to board a plane or ship (All aboard!).  In Castillian Spanish, they use 'embarcar'- to embark on a trip via plane or ship.<br>  Even street slang undertakes this metamorphosis, as for in Latin-American Spanish they say 'Eres un As!' (meaning being an 'ace' in sports), in Spain they say 'Eres un crack!' (from the English expression, 'You're cracking good!'<br>  <br>  Quedo a vuestro servicio de sus preguntas...<br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|RPpXarDDaa	jonny spanish is a great podcast. spain spanish is considered to be more formal and correct. and latin american spanish is more adulterated, with influences from the native and african languages.<br>  <br>  for instance...vosotros is not used in latin america but it is used in spain.

zBqt99avaa	Um, no we don't necessarily pray and fast for 40 days.  Before trying to draw lopsided parallels, you might want to research.<br>  <br>  Only certain Christians even celebrate lent.  Generally we give up one thing we really like.  Many, many, many Christians (who celebrate lent) do give something up.  Even if we don't practise much else in our religion.  Like some Muslims who never pray or go to the masjid but fast for Ramadan every year.  No one's perfect.<br>  <br>  MAJEED:  for the love of God, on the day of Judgement, God will call you to task for the lies you write about Christianity.  If this is what you actually believe, I pity you your ignorance.<br>  <br>  Not just Christians think about sex...if you don't that's a personal problem and not a problem with Christianity.<br>  <br>  Atheists by definition are not Christians.  Whoa.<br>  <br>  R&S section is full of aetheists.  That has NOTHING to do with Christianity.<br>  <br>  Only Catholics have priests, so you can't say priests of every church.  Moreover we do NOT have to pay a monthly fee to attend.  There is weekly collection which is VOLUNTARY.  <br>  <br>  Ever hear of Zakat or can you even focus on Islam with all the time you spend making up lies about Christianity?<br>  <br>  Priests do not make changes to the bible themselves.<br>  <br>  All people interpret their holy books as to their understanding.  But unlike Islam, not just anyone can lead a group of people in religious services in Christianity; they have to attend schools and learn about the background, etc.<br>  <br>  Christians don't know what they're doing?  I don't think you ever know what you're doing.  Certainly not when you're writing about Christianity.<br>  <br>  I've been studying the Quran and the only lightening amazement I've experienced is that anyone can say it's easy to understand.  I'm not putting it down (unlike what you're doing) but it's *not* easy to understand, people.<br>  <br>  Plenty of Christians learn about Islam and do not convert.  Catholic priests DO NOT teach Catholics that they will go to hell for reading the Quran.  That is the stupidest thing I've heard since that girl yesterday said Muslims hide in Ramadan section.  They do NOT scare their congregations fearing that if they learn about Islam, they will convert and Church will loose a paying member that generates <br>  good paying job for priests. <br>  <br>  Priests do NOT have good paying jobs.  They live an austere life.  They dedicate themselves totally to serving their parishoners, which is why they don't work.<br>  <br>  No arguement on evangelical MINISTERS (not priests, ever).<br>  <br>  There is a huge difference between the Islam you practise and the Christianity you believe exists.  Outside of your mind however, we are more alike than you might want to admit.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Lent is a Roman Catholic and Orthodox tradition.<br>  <br>  It is not Biblical.<br>  <br>  Therefore, Protestants and basic run-of-the-mill Christians don't bother with it.|`|SuKS1OQtaa	Because a lot of Christians just say they are Christian, but they don't really take their religion as seriously as they claim they do. They just call themselves Christian because that's the way they were brought up. Some of them don't even no anything about the religion they claim to follow...|`|UhyvM73iaa	Today too many Christians are materialistic having no interest in religion. In young age most of them think about having sex 27 times a day as one research survey have found. Lots of them are atheists.<br>  If you read questions and answers in Yahoo.Answers  Religion and Spirituality you will be surprized how many atheists answer the questions. <br>  Another problem is that Priests of every Church want them to pay monthly fee to attend the Church whereas in Islam there is no monthly fee. Donations for Masjid are voluntarily and Imams never force them to pay with monthly fixed fee to attend Masjid.  Every poor, unemployed and rich is welcome to come to Masjid.  Because Allah has not given mental abilitity equal to all humans. <br>  <br>  We have true words of Allah in Quran that have powerful effect on people's minds. Quran motivates us to fast and pray to God for straight 30 days. We continue what we do in the month of Ramadan.  Pir Ramadan fastomg and worshipping is spiritual training of 30 days so we hopefully continue doing the same for rest of the year. <br>  <br>  Other religions don't have such motivating power in the words of their Priests.  Because they all use words written by Paul, Mark, Mathew and Luke. They were not Prophets but were story writers. Bible would have been much powerful if Jesus had written Bible himself  and had saved his surmons.  Because Allah had to send the final revelation Quran,  Bible was never meant to be saved. Christians made Jesus god, so now they can not acceot any one lesser than god though Jesus never was god in the first place.<br>  All  Priests interpret words of Bible whichever way they choose and even make changes in Bible. That really screws minds of Christians.. They seldome know what they are.doing.  <br>  <br>  When they study Quran, they are amazed like lightening struck to their mind.  That is why once they fully learn about Islam, chances are that they convert as Muslims.  That is why Catholic priests teach Catholics that if they will read Quan, they will end up in hell. They scare their congregations fearing that if they learn about Islam, they will convert and Church will loose a paying member that generates <br>  good paying job for priests. Muslim Masjids do not have this problems. Most Imams in the Masajids are voluntary Imamas in  USA.<br>  They have their own professions for earning their living  and they <br>  do the duties of Imam to serve the community without no charge. This way they attain more knowledge and pass it on to others to gain reward from Allah in Hereafter. <br>  <br>  Christian Evangelican priests and pastures  use all kinds of psychology to arouse sentiments of people on television only to raise funds for their organization.  Those priests get paid in millions for raising high bucks working as Actors on stage to fetch money from their listeners by arousing their emotional with their acting and  public speaking skills to get listeners empty their pockets. <br>  <br>  There is buge difference between Islam and Christianity. <br>  May Allah guide us all to the true path of Allah that Islam teaches.|`|554381d81e1b4f8ef27de3b4ca895275aa	i believe lent is a catholic holiday which does not comprise all of christianity, so the baptists and the methodists and the presbys and the lutherans (you get my point) don't do lent, and that's why.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Muslims have to fast 30 days.<br>  Not ALL muslims are religious.<br>  Many muslims are ignorant and many muslims are religious.|`|kDUBuBxnaa	Apparently Islam is the most practiced religion in the world.|`|qHutCtiwaa	Snap.

The effect varies by location, but worldwide it has been estimated to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. However, since 1990, the trend has reversed.[1]<br>  <br>  It is thought to have been caused by an increase in particulates such as sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere due to human action. The switch from a "global dimming" trend to a "brightening" trend in 1990 happened just as global aerosol levels started to decline.<br>  <br>  Global dimming has interfered with the hydrological cycle by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.<br>  <br>  Deliberate manipulation of this dimming effect is now being considered as a geoengineering technique to reduce the impact of climate change.<br>  <br>  YouTube Link:<br>  Global Dimming Documentary Part 1/5 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLfBXRPoHRc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLfBXRPoH...</a><br>  <br>  Download the Doc:<br>  <a href="http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/18429795/Global+Dimming?tab=summary" rel="nofollow">http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/18429...</a><br>  <br>  NOVA Site:<br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sun/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sun/</a><br>  <br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Streaming on YouTube:<br>  The Great Global Warming Swindle part 1of 9 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOKXM6FgvQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qOKXM6Fg...</a><br>  <br>  Dowload the full doc:<br>  <a href="http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/17727634/The+Great+Global+Warming+Swindle?tab=summary" rel="nofollow">http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/17727...</a><br>  <br>  The Great Global Warming Swindle<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_G...</a><br>  Viewpoints expressed in the film:<br>  The film's basic premise is that the current scientific consensus on the anthropogenic causes of global warming has numerous scientific flaws, and that vested monetary interests in the scientific establishment and the media discourage the public and the scientific community from acknowledging or even debating this. The film asserts that the publicised scientific consensus is the product of a "global warming activist industry" driven by a desire for research funding. Other culprits, according to the film, are Western environmentalists promoting expensive solar and wind power over cheap fossil fuels in Africa, resulting in African countries being held back from industrialising.<br>  <br>  A number of academics, environmentalists, think-tank consultants and writers are interviewed in the film in support of its various assertions. They include the Canadian environmentalist Patrick Moore, founding member of Greenpeace but for the past 21 years a critic of the organisation; Richard Lindzen, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Patrick Michaels, Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia; Nigel Calder, editor of New Scientist from 1962 to 1966; John Christy, professor and director of the Earth System Science Center at University of Alabama; Paul Reiter of the Pasteur Institute; the former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson; and Piers Corbyn, a British weather forecaster.<br>  <br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  <br>  The Year Without A Summer:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_year_without_a_summer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_year_wi...</a><br>  <br>  The Year Without a Summer (also known as the Poverty Year, Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death, and the Year There Was No Summer) was 1816, in which severe summer climate abnormalities destroyed crops in Northern Europe, the American Northeast and eastern Canada.[1][2] Historian John D.

Matthes in 1939.[2] Climatologists and historians working with local records no longer expect to agree on either the start or end dates of this period, which varied according to local conditions. Some confine the Little Ice Age to approximately the 16th century to the mid 19th century.[3] It is generally agreed that there were three minima, beginning about 1650, about 1770, and 1850, each separated by slight warming intervals.[4]<br>  <br>  It is not certain if the LIA was a global phenomenon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on Bradley and Jones, 1993; Hughes and Diaz, 1994; Crowley and Lowery, 2000 describes the LIA as "a modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during this period of less than 1°C," and suggests that "current evidence does not support globally synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this timeframe"[5] However, there is also evidence that a cooling period in the time frame of the LIA also occurred in the Southern Hemisphere[6][7][8][9][10][2]|`|bOfDpTLxaa	it isn't a myth. not entirely anyway. global warming is a natural process. it's even happening on Mars, though at a slower rate. you see the earth goes in a cycle of heating up and cooling down, hence the multiple ice ages as well as eras in which the earth was covered in dense jungle.

The basic idea is that the earth, in it's ever changing state really faces no risk, as climate change is constantly occurring in cycles, and we are still coming out of an ice age.  Therefore, all ecofriendly groups, who currently are fully aware of this notion, are ripping off the government, or the public to raise funding for a program that is unnecessary.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if the research Chricton provides is reliable, just that this fiction novel is based on facts.  The impression I get though, is that it is not dissimilar to the effect of the Davinci code, where the author presents theory as fact, and the genpop assume he is a credible expert, and all of a sudden we believe in conspiracies.  He could, on the other hand, be on to something.

j5YwuVEIaa	We are currently living in a time where these things are the rarest they have ever been.<br>  <br>  PEOPLE OF THE LAST DAYS<br>  10 Aside from identifying certain world developments, the Bible foretold that the last days would be marked by a change in human society. The apostle Paul described what people in general would be like. At 2?Timothy 3:1-5, we read: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.” In part, Paul said that people would be<br>  ? lovers of themselves<br>  ? lovers of money<br>  ? disobedient to parents<br>  ? disloyal<br>  ? having no natural affection<br>  ? without self-control<br>  ? fierce<br>  ? lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God<br>  ? having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power<br>  11 Have people become like that in your community? No doubt they have. There are people everywhere who have bad traits. This shows that God will soon act, for the Bible says: “When the wicked ones sprout as the vegetation and all the practicers of what is hurtful blossom forth, it is that they may be annihilated forever.”—Psalm 92:7.<br>  POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS!<br>  12 The last days are indeed filled with woe, just as the Bible foretold. In this troubled world, however, there are positive developments among the worshipers of Jehovah.<br>  13 “The true knowledge will become abundant,” the Bible book of Daniel foretold. When would that happen? During “the time of the end.” (Daniel 12:4) Especially since 1914, Jehovah has helped those who truly desire to serve him to grow in understanding of the Bible. They have grown in appreciation of precious truths about God’s name and purpose, the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the condition of the dead, and the resurrection. Moreover, worshipers of Jehovah have learned how to live their lives in a way that benefits them and brings praise to God. They have also gained a clearer understanding of the role of God’s Kingdom and how it will set matters straight on the earth. What do they do with this knowledge? That question brings us to yet another prophecy that is being fulfilled in these last days.<br>  14 “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth,” said Jesus Christ in his prophecy about “the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matthew 24:3,?14) Throughout the earth, the good news of the Kingdom—what the Kingdom is, what it will do, and how we can receive its blessings—is being preached in over 230 lands and in more than 400 languages. Millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses zealously preach the Kingdom good news. They come from “all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” (Revelation 7:9) The Witnesses conduct free home Bible studies with millions of people who want to know what the Bible really teaches. What an impressive fulfillment of prophecy, especially since Jesus foretold that true Christians would be “objects of hatred by all people”!—Luke 21:17.|`|jsuySwTVaa	I think you should direct this question to a politician (or anyone who desires the orgasmic delights of power).

If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

It is we who anthropomorphize God to suit our needs.  We conveniently place God in a box so as to better control the rants and thoughts of others around us.  Not so that God can better control us.<br>  <br>  We often set unrealistic definitions on a thing we can not even begin to define so we come up with virtues and limitations which are human and assign them to the Greatest of All Things Imaginable and Unimaginable.  We assign qualities to the God that we would see in others around us.<br>  <br>  Whether or not there is a trinity or a quad or a doublet, or just a single God doesn't really matter since there is intent and belief behind many of the answers you will receive.<br>  <br>  I personally believe the best answer is that we can never truly know the Divine nature of God.  We can impose things like "Omnipotent" and "Omniscient", but then we place limitations on God by saying "God is Trinity" or God is "Quatrain" or that God loves this, but doesn't love that...<br>  <br>  God is God.  Plane and simple.  Why continue to set limitation on God by trying to define something we can never hope to understand?|`|AA10316921	I don't know...maybe he will make a bigger chain of  McDonald's fast food restaurants so i can get a job.

(I am turning 20 in May)  Honestly it was one of the most frightening experiences of my life, I will not lie.  But when it finally happened.... it was one of the most amazing things I'd ever experienced.  The first time it happened I was laying in bed, trying to sleep because I had school in the morning.  I'd say I was laying there for about 2 minutes, when I heard a wind-like noise rushing through my ears.  The I felt a sensation throughout my body as though it was melting off my bed.  I was scared, and paralyzed.  I couldn't scream, move, or anything.  So I let my body relax, and next thing I knew, I was looking at myself sleeping.  I was standing in my room, looking at myself.  I started to attempt to walk toward the door.  Everything was blurred together.  Almost like a watercolor painting.  I was moving sooooo slowly too.  I could barely move, as though I was in a pool of molasses or something.  When I finally reached the door I snapped back into my body.  I woke up terrified and confused.  I thought I was going insane.  I had never experienced such a thing before, so it frightened me.  I had heard about such things happening but always thought it was BS.  <br>  <br>  After almost 6 years, I've read a countless number of books on astral projection, lucid dreaming, OOBEs, spirit guides, meditation, etc.  I now can have an out of body experience almost every night, when I want to.  Sometimes, however they do get a bit frightening.  But you'll find that out.  It's too much to write about.  <br>  Usually I get myself extremely relaxed beforehand.  Meditation is key to having an out of body experience.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and make sure you buy books on it!  They really do help.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	If you're smart you'll ask God never to have one of those experiences.|`|xQ6P4bVEaa	i could give you one if you have sex with me

FQeSo65Haa	Spanish is definitely easier, but only in terms of pronunciation (the grammar structure is surprisingly similar to French and other Latin-based languages).<br>  <br>  I would say definitely take French, though, as you've already done 3 years of French. Universities would rather see someone fluent at a language than know how to say "Hello how are you" in 7 languages..|`|VLcDWWwmaa	The sound system of Spanish is easier for English speakers to master than French. French has somewhat more shared vocabulary with English, although Spanish is definitely not at a shortage of English cognates. Grammatically, French is only slightly more complicated than Spanish. In terms of spelling, Spanish is definitely easier, as it is more directly phonetic than French. <br>       I don't know how devoted you are to learning languages, but if it were me, I'd keep studying both. If you only want to take one, then you have two options. If your primary concern is university acceptance, most upper level educational institutions prefer to see a student who has stuck with a language throughout their academic career, so you would be better off continuing French. If your goal is practical usage, however, Spanish is your best bet. There is a lot higher demand for Spanish speakers than French speakers.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope this helped!|`|CIqI2CXaaa	in my school, we took a marking period of french and then of spanish to see which one we would take the year after. spanish is more widely spoken, but french is much more easier to learn, and closer to english. you've already taken french for 3 years, and if you do spanish now, it's a whole other language that you have to learn. i'd pick french|`|QIwhMrBraa	if uve done french 3 years then skipping to spanish now is silly. also, its gonna mess u up cos ur gonna keep saying things in french.<br>  <br>  stick with what you know and improve on it rather tha start over.<br>  <br>  spanish is not easier than french in my opinion, too many long words for my taste. i chose french, stuck with it, then dabbled in italian and i keep saying s**t in french even still|`|Czpfs8RLaa	They are about the same, Im Canadian so Ive learned French from a younge age but as far as Im concerned they are both farely easy, it you like French go for it :)|`|CTlkMN3Faa	French dressing is delicious|`|80A6iHoGaa	Spanish i think..but everyone has their own opinion|`|aixy8EmKaa	spanish is way easier|`|FSbyWJjCaa	french is way eisier of course|`|cA3PAgetaa	I took spanish, and if you wanted to learn, it was easy<br>  <br>  everyone i know says french is harder to learn, and my sister took 4 years of it and doesn't remember any of it<br>  <br>  so i'd suggest spanish<br>  <br>  but you've also taken 3 years of french, and a year of spanish, so its really whichever you think is easier to pick up|`|EJKJTrK7aa	I'm in year 10 and I do French. I'm glad I didn't do Spanish as it is a lot harder to learn things like the perfect and imperfect tense etc. in Spanish.

rHlEqiRbaa	of course, it s so!!!|`|SkOALXv9aa	You sound like one that has permitted yourself to adopt a negative and argumentative attitude as a major part of your personal make up.<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes those who have managed to make this attribute a part of their personal demeanor to stop and take a serious look at how others perceive them and want to be around them.<br>  <br>  Once you reevaluate and understand the Image that you exhibit that causes others to back away.  You will be equipped with the necessary information and knowledge to clean up your act and be a more likable and understanding friend.<br>  <br>  Many time people try to make others believe they are an expert in all fields when in reality we all know that they are not.  Quit trying to impress others through deception and replace it with that part of you that you are not letting work in your favor.  That of being honest, kind, respectful and sympathetic.<br>  <br>  This will do wonders in drawing others toward you and you will find that you too will also be a much happier person.|`|zzkmdusEaa	A person who shows rude behavior is usually a person who does not care about what they say or do to anyone or is any bit considerate to the people they are rude to.

sfTPrMFpaa	Let me just give you my personal experience on your 2 statements: <br>  <br>  French people are arrogant: no but yes<br>  Most French people are really nice, but a lot of Parisian are indeed arrogant (even to their own people they call "provincial"), and there is a lot of Parisian, so they are probably the one who carry abroad this false idea that all French are arrogant, when it is often people from this one city who are.<br>  (and when you think about it, most tourists only visit Paris, so they got their idea there)<br>  <br>  British food is disgusting: no but yes<br>  I've been to London and food in the restaurants there is generally pretty good, often equal to the food you'd find in any major capital.<br>  However, I am military and went to Afghanistan (lots of Britz there) On the main camp in Kandahar there is 3 kitchens: the "american" one (of US and canadian inspired food), the "Britz", and the "international" (of food representing the rest of the nationalities on camp). It is my regret to say that, for military staples, the Britz had the lowest standard. Less fresh fruits and vegetable, an almost non-existent salad bar, and rarely a protein source not dipped in fat or fried.<br>  One food I discovered there that I liked : mushy peas.<br>  <br>  So, I guess every reputation has its origins, but it would be bad to apply them indiscriminately.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I agree with you. I'm British but I learned French at school and for many years afterwards. I have been fluent in the language for a very long time and enjoy French culture. Speaking another language opens a lot of doors and enables one to make friends with people from other countries and to appreciate literature and other cultural aspects which would otherwise be closed to us.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	What is your question?<br>  <br>  Also, French food is disgusting, and British people are arrogant ;)

What the phuck is "..."?|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	If I haven't gotten what I lent back by now, I'll give up on getting it back.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	What About Lent?<br>  What, then, is the basis for Christendom’s practice of fasting during Lent? Both Catholic and Protestant churches recognize Lent, although the manner of observing it differs from church to church. Some eat just one meal a day during the full 40-day period preceding Easter. Others fast totally only on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. For some, Lent requires abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, and milk products.<br>  Lent is supposedly based on Jesus’ 40-day fast after his baptism. Was he then establishing a ritual to be followed yearly? Not at all. This is evident from the fact that the Bible does not record any such practice among the early Christians. Lent was first observed in the fourth century after Christ. Like many other teachings of Christendom, it was borrowed from pagan sources.<br>  If Lent is in imitation of Jesus’ fasting in the wilderness after his baptism, why is it observed during the weeks leading up to Easter—supposedly the time of his resurrection? Jesus did not fast during the days prior to his death. The Gospel accounts indicate that he and his disciples visited homes and ate meals in Bethany just a few days before he died. And he ate the Passover meal the night before his death.—Matthew 26:6, 7; Luke 22:15; John 12:2.<br>  There is something to be learned from Jesus’ fasting after his baptism. He was embarking on a vital ministry. The vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and the future of the entire human race were involved. This was a time for deep meditation and for prayerfully turning to Jehovah for help and guidance. During this time Jesus appropriately fasted. This indicates that fasting can be beneficial when done with the right motive and on a fitting occasion.—Compare Colossians 2:20-23.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	religion.|`|POygTyTAaa	church

dDprsKZYaa	Dude. It's just water.<br>  Get a towel.|`|XoNuUrYoaa	If you were baptised as an infant or unwillingly, then the baptism means nothing.Consider the catholic and anglican churches who baptise babies; they do so, so that the child grows up thinking that they are catholic/anglican, but they aren't they just merely attend a catholic or an anglican church- unless they repent their sins, as one is meant to when being baptised.|`|yhTPcF81aa	Uh.... you got dunked in a tub of water..... oooooo...... how spiritual..... Ooogggiittyyy boooggittty.   Petty superstition.|`|POygTyTAaa	drain the tub|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Infant baptism" is false and unbiblical anyway.  "Infant baptism" accomplishes nothing with the Lord. <br>  <br>  Water baptism cannot save.  Water baptism is not required for salvation, and cannot be added to Jesus's PERFECT salvation. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	Sorry, you have been claimed for Christ, the sacrament has "left an indelible mark" at least that what the church teaches.

That the tree represents a christian who is not "bearing fruit" or bringing people to the lord. My problem with this story is this, figs were *not in season*!!! The tale would have made much more sense if it was the time of year for the tree to be full of figs and it was still bare. Then the tree is barren and not producing. That makes sense. But from this I see that Jesus just killed a perfectly good tree, with the potential bare fruit. So in this is Jesus saying that even if you feel you are not "in season"..not ready, not knowledgeable enough, or yet comfortable spreading the word that you should be cut down/kept out of heaven? Or is he saying that there is no season for christians? I am really lost on this one..more so than even some of the other bible tales.|`|AA12084096	He didn't "loose his temper"  He made a decision to use the tree as a visual aid of sorts.|`|AA10096992	After eating figs for days, he was STILL blocked up.

He will destroy anything and anyone who is not bearing fruit.  <br>  <br>  Galatians 5:22 describes these fruits as:<br>  love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.<br>  <br>  At the moment some of you think you can get away with your outright disrespect towards others, yourselves and/or anything Holy but there will come a time when Jesus will return and Judge us ALL.<br>  <br>  I pray for you.<br>  Peace.|`|YrrFIoEiaa	Why did this happen    Go read the Outlaw Preyer by johnny paycheck its a ture story in a song it happen in Ft worth, texas This has happen to me have my wife this last month in mcAllen Tx because we was homeless a wild & did't what homeless people coming to there church the church was lady of sorrows catholic church McAllen Texas We are not homeless now  The church would not let us have food|`|POygTyTAaa	It wasn't about the tree.

This FACT in the Bible proves that some politically influential Preachers are PROMOTING HOMOPHOBIA on their own initiative! Some of them are coward gays in the closet like the Reverend Ted Haggard the US NATIONAL RELIGIOUS ADVISER to President Bush on Fundie Christian issues!!<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 16:[48-49], [53], [55] (NIV) [48-49] As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you* (*what JERUSALEM did! Most Christians refuse to agree with God that according to the Bible writers JERUSALEM IS FAR MORE SINFUL THAN SODOM EVER WAS...!) and your daughters have done. ”Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom* (*Christian bigots ought to read the Bible more carefully to find out what was wrong with Sodom!): She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy...* (*Neither God the Father nor his Son Jesus Christ EVER MENTIONED THAT THE SIN OF SODOM was homosexuality! Jesus is making favorable statements about SODOM all along --Mat 10:15, 11:24, Mar 6:11, Luc 10:12) [53] "However, I* (*God) WILL RESTORE the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them… [55] And your sisters, SODOM with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE* (*this is an UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION of Sodom!); and you and your daughters will return to what you were before* (*repentance means to regret what anybody did before and CHANGE, but there is no repentance implied in this full context here! So the Sodomites didn’t do anything wrong!).<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 13:23 (KJV) Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?...<br>  <br>  NEVER…!!! So the gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and so on CAN’T POSSIBLE CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE…! Ask the Reverend Ted Haggard! The Jewish Bible writers admit that Jerusalem is far more “liberal” than Sodom! We know that most preachers depend on going along with what the Christians traditionally believe not necessarily what the Bible says!<br>  <br>  According to the God inspired Bible writers the full restoration of SODOM must be taking place right now before the 2nd coming of Jesus!  If so, then there is nothing wrong with gays and the same sex marriage issue that we hear today…!!! Christians are passionately AGAINST the fulfillment of Bible prophecies that they don’t like. The old Sodomites were much holier and far more respectful of women than Righteous Lot was. Lot pledged his virgin daughters to be married to heterosexual SODOMITES (Sodomites = Citizens of Sodom not necessarily anal sex enjoying people like Christians claim!) who believed in virgin “purity” until marriage…!!! (Gen 19:14) It was Righteous Lot who took away his own virgin daughters from their heterosexual Sodomite fiances to give them away to some gay Sodomites who were looking for the male visitors who came to visit Lot. Actually these “visitors” didn’t come looking for Lot at all! They INSISTED on spending the night out in the main street of Sodom NOT AT ALL at Lot’s pad! (Gen 19:2-3) These “visitors” knew where the action in Sodom was and they wanted to spend the night in the middle of it, but Lot wanted them for himself! (Gen 19:12).  The jerks who wrote the New Testament didn’t pay attention to what really happened in Sodom! Abraham didn’t tell the “angels” that his nephew Lot was in Sodom at all! Christians don’t pay attention to what they read in the Bible if they read it at all, either! Their preachers feed them the traditional homophobic bit out of a few poached verses in the Bible. Anyway, Sodom is destroyed.<br>  <br>  The Bible story writers continue to tell us that Lot had his daughter fermenting some wine to spice up some sex parties going until LOT GOT HIS YOUNG VIRGIN DAUGHTERS PREGNANT! God was so impressed with Lot’s sexual performance that he called him a RIGHTEOUS MAN throughout the Bible, Old and New Testaments! (2 Pet 2:7-8) Lot was a legal resident of Sodom. The angels of God got him and his whole family out of Sodom before it was destroyed! Lot escaped by accident! No angel came looking for him personally at all! Christian dishonesty in telling the Bible story of Sodom is a sham! There is no trace of evidence from any other source outside of the Bible that Sodom and Gomorrah ever existed, either but what the heck! The Bible preachers hurt and persecute the gay community on a fairy tale!  Now Christian bigots are actually preventing the fulfillment of Bible prophecies about the FULL RESTORATION of Sodom!  Hey, let’s give the Bible God a chance!  It is all in the BIBLE! It won’t be long before the Holy Clergy and preachers will wise up to monitor the morality of same sex marriages and of the ladies in desperate need of a decent secular abortion, not the Bible stoning to death of adulterous women with a fetus in their womb, and so on!<br>  <br>  The last book in the Bible, the Book of Revelation ends up with the statement that Jesus will be surrounded FOR ALL ETERNITY by 144,000 virgin Jewish guys WHO WERE NEVER DEFILED WITH WOMEN!!!  It doesn’t mean that they were not involved in sexual activities among themselves! BUT THEY NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN!  Men in the South display bumper stickers declaring “Real Men Love Jesus, Too!”  They are looking forward to the day that they will be married to Jesus in their much expected “WEDDING OF THE LAMB” deal in Revelation! So why oppose same sex marriage now of people loving each other?  Same sex in the Bible is ultimately OK!<br>  <br>  Revelation (KJV) 19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb* (*Jesus Christ) is come, and his wife* (*The Christians of the right Church brand) hath made herself ready.  <br>  <br>  Revelation 14:4 (KJV) These*(144,000 virgin Jewish Guys) are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb* (*very subjective title for an alleged macho man like Jesus!).  <br>  <br>  Any Christian man wanting to get near Jesus in Heaven must elbow himself in through a lot of virgin Jewish guys… and the Christian ladies must be very careful not to touch any of them…! There is NO REFERENCE WHATSOEVER in the whole Bible about “Virgin” females or even nuns near Jesus… The nunnery idea was developed by the Early Church Fathers to satisfy a female masochistic religious fetish.<br>  <br>  The Apocalyptic Revelation of Jesus Christ for the “Last Days” say a lot about Jesus’ sexual orientation! Jesus never accused the homosexuals of anything! In fact he highly favored them over the Jews! <br>  <br>  Matthew 11:24 (NIV) But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you."<br>  <br>  Jesus is demonstrating to have much more love and favoritism for the gays and Lesbians than for his own Jewish people! Jesus was inspired by God the Holy Ghost to make statements favoring the Sodomites over the Jews! Of the New Testament writers on Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Saint Jude AND MOST PREACHERS TODAY are the only ones disagreeing with Jesus and God about the Sodom and the Sodomites!<br>  <br>  Jesus also stated that even the PROSTITUTES…not ex-prostitutes, but active prostitutes will enter his Kingdom ahead of the Jews! <br>  <br>  Matthew 21:31b * Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you* (*Jews – The Jews don’t mind to let the whores get in first so they will be there when they get there!). <br>  <br>  Luke 15:30 * But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'* (*a Playboy guy in the Bible gets no reprimand at all, but he is celebrated for sharing his daddy’s inheritance with prostitutes!) <br>  <br>  Rahab is the greatest example of them all! She will never lose her GOD GIVEN license of RIGHTEOUS PROSTITUTE for eternity! Heaven won’t be that boring after all..!!! Sex is so fulfilling when you do it with a RIGHTEOUS PROSTITUTE...!!! Jimmy Swaggart didn’t pick the right one, I guess… <br>  <br>  Hebrews 11:31* (The Faithful Hall of Fame) (KJV) By faith the PROSTITUTE* (*not ex-prostitute, but prostitute) Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.<br>  <br>  James 2:25 (KJV) In the same way, was not even Rahab the PROSTITUTE* (*not the ex-prostitute, but the prostitute!) considered RIGHTEOUS for what she did when SHE GAVE LODGING* (*Bible key code word for sex in bed) to the spies and sent them off in a different direction (Joshua 2 and 6).<br>  <br>  I am not the Devil tempting anybody, but the Bible teaches that a God fearing gorgeous girl should always be available to spend some time in bed with Godly spies! Rahab was eagerly waiting for sweet Jesus loving customers all the time! BTW, I’m sure that the Jews don’t mind to let the prostitutes go to Heaven first as long as they are there when they get there! So if you have a choice of favoring a prostitute, a Sodomite (gay or lesbian), or a Jew… which one would you choose??? Hint: WWJD??  IT IS ALL IN THE BIBLE FOR THE WORLD TO READ… but hardly anybody reads the Bible!|`|usfVqbajaa	babbylon|`|gHSarVD1aa	Babylon was more of an economic, social and technology empire.

AA11166769	I would imagine that non-marital sex is difficult to obtain in India, because many Indians are still very conservative about such matters and are waiting for marriage.

They respect their culture and no one ever thinks of violating it. Indians see the marriage so sacred that they tend to be one until death if they get married once. They think that sex is an activity not only between bodies, but also between souls. If they understand each others' interests, their relationship continues forever. According to Indians, non-marital sex is just an activity between bodies, in which pleasure remains for a few minutes. I think the cause for India's high population is the marital sex without using any birth controls. Now-a-days, everyone is aware of the disadvantages of having more children and are following birth control.|`|61HgZSkLaa	The base of the India is tradition and soul is respect.<br>  One of the biggest reason for non-marital sex is our Indian culture.We need to proud of this because,it is great way to say "I respect you".May it is for mother,father,sister or any outsider.<br>  According to indian culture 'After marrage soul mix up and that is real defination of marital sex.'<br>  It is impossible to say marital sex root cause of india's high population.|`|88bDvyiwaa	I thought after Slumdog, marital sex was available in India.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Not difficult<br>  -No

Ltx89w04aa	Good and bad things happen to good and bad people.  It's called "life".<br>  <br>  If you look in nature, for instance, good and bad things happen to animals all the time, and animals really aren't good or bad.  It's just the way the world works.<br>  <br>  The reason why it seems bad things happen all the time is, believe it or not, a biological/chemical process in our brains.  Studies have shown that negative events have more of an impact on our psyche than good ones - we dwell on them more, and they remain much fresher in our minds than positive events.  So it may seem bad things are happening all the time to good people, but in reality, there are good things happening, too.<br>  <br>  Both good and bad people get cancer.  There are good and bad rich people.  Life, unfortunately, isn't fair and is often random.  You can do much to improve your own situation (always explore the alternatives), but things do just happen.

Therefore Confucius teaching is suitable from kindergartners, students in many levels: politicians, parents, workers, merchants, to empire.

Confucius attempted to convince the warlords to execute peaceful ruling over the citizens as to prevent war and killings.

IHxcqYt5aa	Definitely keep in contact with him, as he wants to keep in touch as well. Almost like become his best friend whilst he's going out with this other person as he will then turn to you when he's in trouble etc. If and when his relationship ends with this other person, you may want to start stepping your friendship up a level, but not too soon because that can also be a turn off. The last thing you want is for you two to become distant from each other. If he really missed you then of course he cares. Chances are it's just one of those relationships for a relationship phase, but then he may not be able to get you out of his mind.

When you leave items in places where they do not belong someone has to put them back in their rightful place.  Facing (putting sale items in order on the shelves) is hard enough work without someone coming along displacing goods.  Shame on you!  <br>  <br>  I don't work in a grocery store, but I know it costs me more money when spoilage occurs because people like you put perishable items anywhere except back in the refrigerated cases.  The store certainly doesn't take the loss.  They just add it to the price of goods sold there.  <br>  <br>  The guy shouldn't have touched you.  That was unlawful.  However, you need to realize that you don't live alone in the world and be more considerate in the future.  Your race likely had nothing to do with the situation.|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Honestly if you got the gut feeling that he was really being a jerk because you were white than your probably right.

aPuj6xoHaa	I have similar experiences.<br>  <br>  Technology is not bad in and of itself, but the internet, cell phones, text messaging, game consoles, satellite tv, etc., has had more of an effect of separating people rather than bring them together.  Again it is not the technology itself, but people have tended to use it as an excuse at times to not get together and share meals and time together at each others homes.  <br>  <br>  They are good memories but you can't really go back.

But, I agree that it can be abused and over used.  When you were young the good old days may have seemed good to you, but there was a lot more racism and discrimination that you were not aware of back then.<br>  <br>  I like the Reverend Soleil's response.<br>  <br>  I think the human race needs to move beyond contemporary religion.  For the most part it does not bring people together at all (unless they are of the same religion).  It is another separating force.<br>  <br>  We need to realize that everyone is first and foremost "human".  We are one big family.

I don't want to just think that I'm happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  I also agree with the Reverend. I think that it would be really nifty to find out what the future will be like.

5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	Sorry for the cut and paste, but this is succinct and accurate.<br>  <br>  Denominations of Judaism: <br>  Jewish movements, often referred to as denominations, branches or sects of Judaism, differ from each other in some beliefs and thus in the way they observe Judaism. Differences between Jewish movements, in contrast to differences between Christian denominations, derive from interpreting Jewish scriptures in more progressive/liberal or more traditional/conservative ways rather then from theological differences.<br>  <br>  1. Orthodox Judaism: <br>  Orthodox Jews believe that God gave Moses the whole Torah (Written and Oral) at Mount Sinai. Orthodox Jews believe that the Torah contains 613 mitzvot (commandments) that are binding upon Jews. Modern Orthodox Jews strictly observe halakhah (Jewish Law), but still integrate into modern society. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, which includes Chasidic Jews, strictly observe Jewish laws and do not integrate into modern society by dressing distinctively and living separately.<br>  <br>  2. Conservative Judaism: <br>  Conservative Judaism maintains that the ideas in the Torah come from God, but were transmitted by humans and contain a human compontent. Conservative Judaism generally accepts the binding nature of halakhah (Jewish Law), but believes that the Law should adapt, absorbing aspects of the predominant culture while remaining true to Judaism's values. <br>  <br>  3. Reform Judaism: <br>  Reform Judaism believes that the Torah was written by different human sources, rather than by God, and then later combined. While Reform Judaism does not accept the binding nature of halakhah (Jewish Law), the movement does retain much of the values and ethics of Judaism as well as some of the practices and culture. <br>  <br>  4. Reconstructionist Judaism: <br>  Reconstructionists believe that Judaism is an "evolving religious civilization." In one way it is more liberal than Reform Judaism - the movement does not believe in a personified deity that is active in history and does not believe that God chose the Jewish people. In another way Reconstructionist Judaism is less liberal than Reform Judaism - Reconstructionists may observe Jewish Law, not because it is a binding Law from God, but because it is a valuable cultural remnant.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I knew it would happen.  Messianic "Judaism" is in no way considered part of Judaism by JEWS.  A Messianic Jew is...tada!  A Christian!|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	There are several different branches of Judaism.  <br>  <br>  Orthodox Judaism is the strictest, and most legalistic, following the law to the letter, as well as the derivations of the law from the Talmud.  <br>  <br>  Reform Judaism came along in the late 1800s; it views the laws as a guide upon which to build, and does not necessarily take the Torah as a literally-true document.<br>  <br>  Conservative Judaism was a sort of response to Reform Judaism by those who felt that Reform Judaism did away with too many traditions, and seeks to re-incorporate those traditions into Jewish life. <br>  <br>  Reconstructionist Judaism is something of the next step after Reform Judaism; some congregations are largely secular in nature, but retain traditions for their value as a cohesive force in Judaism.<br>  <br>  Ultra-Orthodox Judaism tends to be a wide variety of small, ultra-conservative sects, usually focused on a single, charistmatic (and often hereditary) Rebbe/teacher.  Most people have seen these individuals in their traditional "black-hat" dress in heavily Jewish areas of metropolitan areas.<br>  <br>  I'm a Reform Jew.|`|AA11245447	There are a number of branches - Chassidic (ultra-Orthodox - and several groups within Chassidic), Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform.<br>  There are a number of others, much smaller, but these are some of the main branches.<br>  <br>  One place to start is:  <a href="http://judaism.about.com/od/denominationsofjudaism/p/branches.htm" rel="nofollow">http://judaism.about.com/od/denomination...</a>|`|8I9uduIiaa	My fellow Jews have rightly noted that Orthodox, Conservative and Reform are the three main movements.

Hundreds of books with historical, scientific, and archeological data have supported the Bible's credibility. The studies for these truths are called apologetics.<br>  <br>  Most people today, unfortunately, have not even read the Bible. As a result, many people tend to go along with the increasing delusion that the Bible is full of mistakes and no longer relevant to present times. Their searches have been from a surging atheistic desire to disprove the Bible.<br>  <br>  Instead, thousands of investigative findings have led to confirmation of the exact details stated in the Bible. Historical, archeological, and scientific evidences alike have reinforced proof of Bible truths. Confirmations have been almost innumerable, particularly in this last century (i.e. the Dead Sea Scrolls, Red Sea Crossing site, etc).<br>  <br>  Dr. Nelson Glueck, perhaps the utmost modern authority on Israeli archeology, said: "No archeological discovery has ever controverted a Biblical reference. Scores of archeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the Bible. And, by the same token, proper evaluation of Biblical descriptions has often led to amazing discoveries."<br>  <br>  The Word of God was penned by inspiration from the Creator long before scientists stamped their approval on experimental findings. But mankind tends to look at things from a skeptical or scientific, secular perspective when the facts have been in the Bible all along. A few examples of this include:<br>  <br>      * The Earth is round, not flat as once believed (Isaiah 40:22).<br>      * Atmospheric circulation (Ecclesiastes 1:6).<br>      * Field of Gravity (Job 26:7).<br>      * Biological importance of blood to life (Leviticus 17:11).|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Venerated tradition.

However, the recent discovery of a cuneiform tablet dated to 595 BC confirms one of the minor details about an obscure official from the court of King Nebuchadnezzar II, mentioned in the Old Testament book of Jeremiah.<br>  <br>  Michael Jursa, associate professor at the University of Vienna, discovered the Assyrian cuneiform tablet in the British Museum's great Arched Room, which houses 130,000 such tablets. The small tablet, is a bill of receipt acknowledging Nabu-sharrussu-ukin's payment of 0.75 kg of gold to a temple in Babylon.<br>  <br>  The full translation of the tablet reads:<br>  <br>  1.5 minas of gold, the property of Nabu-sharrussu-ukin, the chief eunuch, which he sent via Arad-Banitu the eunuch to [the temple] Esangila: Arad-Banitu has delivered to Esangila. In the presence of Bel-usat, son of Alpaya, the royal bodyguard, [and of] Nadin, son of Marduk-zer-ibni. Month XI, day 18, year 10 [of] Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.2<br>  <br>  Professor Jursa noted that chapter 39 of the Book of Jeremiah contained the same name - Nebo-Sarsekim, although it was spelled differently. According to Jeremiah's account, Nebo-Sarsekim was Nebuchadnezzar's "chief officer" and was with him at the siege of Jerusalem in 587 BC, 8 years after he had provided the cuneiform receipt.<br>  <br>  The discovery of a cuneiform tablet that confirms the existence of a once-mentioned minor official in the Old Testament book of Jeremiah is somewhat of a shock to Bible skeptics. Previous to this discovery, the only confirmed biblical figures were well-known kings. Therefore, this discovery goes a long way to confirm the accuracy of biblical historical accounts.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 40:22 talks about the earth being round before we realized it.<br>  <br>  I believe it's Leviticus that talks about burying excrement and quarantine the sick and washing your hands before doctors and scientist said it was healthy.<br>  <br>  Genesis and the flood of Noah.<br>  Can we find geologic formations that appear to have been made under water? Most certainly yes! There are many such formations. Most of our planet’s surface is covered with sedimentary rocks—those that are often deposited under water or associated with water.<br>  <br>  Let’s consult a modern source for a clear definition: “Sedimentary Rock: in geology, rock composed of geologically reworked materials, formed by the accumulation and consolidation of mineral and particulate matter deposited by the action of water or, less frequently, wind or glacial ice. Most sedimentary rocks are characterized by parallel or discordant bedding that reflects variations in either the rate of deposition of the material or the nature of the matter that is deposited” (“Sedimentary Rock,” Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia, 1993-1997, Microsoft Corporation).<br>  <br>  According to The Dynamic Earth: An Introduction to Physical Geology, 75 percent of the rocks seen on the earth’s surface are sedimentary in origin and the remainder are igneous or volcanic (Brian Skinner and Stephen Porter, 1989, p. 20).<br>  <br>  There you go for the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  This website is perfect for the New Testament.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblewalks.com/Sites/Caesarea..." rel="nofollow">http://www.biblewalks.com/Sites/Caesarea...</a><br>  <br>  It shows all the old tablets and buildings that prove that Pontius Pilate, King Herod, and the Apostle Paul existed!!!<br>  <br>  You can use the book of Matt. for King Herod and Pilate, and the book of Acts for the Apostle Paul.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps!!!|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	Thats a tricky question, see all religion, not just Christianity is based on faith.

rJJhMQ37aa	A good friend of mine DJed for my daughters wedding.  He did a great job for us.  We let him eat all the free food he wanted during the meal time, and while the music played.  No big deal.  Enough of our guests didn't come, so there was lots of extra food. <br>  <br>  The drinking also was fine, because this guy used common sense, and drank little.  His DJ duties meant more than getting smashed might have. Nothing was said about mingling, and he didn't.  He stayed with his equipment.<br>  <br>  I think you should talk with your DJ ahead of time, and the rules need to be clear.

If he would rather attend as a guest, he will say so, if he wants to DJ, then you need to have him treat you like a customer with a contract etc.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Sounds like a bad idea.  The DJ should be professional at all times.  If you want to provide non-alcoholic beverages and food for him while he works, that's fine.  There should be no drinking by the DJ.  That's asking for trouble.  The DJ can still enjoy himself at the event.  He just can't run around the room partying while the song is playing.  He is there to do a job.  Based on your fiance's attitude, I wouldn't trust your fiance to be businesslike when the reception day finally comes.

Just hire some one else, and recommend him to other friends where he will be just a DJ.|`|ZhhH5cAdaa	If you can't allow him to mingle, I absolutely wouldn't hire him.<br>  I hire friends to do things, and my husband and his friends are involved in music locally (dj's, bands...) and they would absolutely feel they were welcome to party along.<br>  <br>  Also, I would allow a DJ I didn't know to eat and drink at my wedding, but that's just the kind of person I am.|`|AA11788494	I would not do it.  It is not professional if he wants to join in when he needs to be working.  It would be different if you had the food and music at separate times but there is no way to please everyone if he wants to work and eat unless he has a helper.  I doubt he does.  Sounds like an easily avoidable mess.|`|AA11327323	I was friendly with a couple of guys, they were Irish ,  and played just Irish music, on all sorts of ancient instruments, I had only seen them perform once in a local pub, they were great, they were performing and drinking and eating all at the same time.<br>                                     The pub landlord was paying for all this free booze etc, but giving them very little cash.<br>                                        As my wedding was going to be a cheepo event with only about 10  friends and some family members , I asked if they wanted to join in , give us a few tunes and eat drink and be merry. I was going to give them a megre amount of money on top of that! I was an apprentice at that time , very short on spare cash.<br>                                    After the wedding it was time for the reception, back at our house.<br>                                      I dont recall ever having a better time, all mates together, all getting stuck into the booze and eating stuff off plates.<br>                                     After about an hour these two started to play, they were fantastic, no one wanted them to stop, I kept refilling their glasses and leaving plates of food nearby , it was all great. <br>                                              I eventually packed them all off, no one wanted to leave, I gave these Irish guys far more cash than I had intended to, but it was all worth every penny and they certainly did the buisiness!<br>                                             That was over 30 years ago, I still see one of these fellers from time to time, he is not rich he never went looking for fame, he is a very happy man.<br>                                                It was a privilage to have these two guys at my wedding.<br>                                               Now the rough bit, I know this will be a good day for you both, and you want every thing to be perfect,  but your idea of perfect and mine are miles apart, give your husband to be some say in this little matter, does it really matter who the DJ is?<br>                                                Are you just after impressing your guests?   Get married have a happy life and sod what the guests think.|`|FcZU29W6aa	I can't remember who said this, but it was someone who was a billionaire and discussing hiring friends or family, or lending money to friends or family:<br>  <br>  He said the following:<br>  <br>  When someone does not perform well at their job or I lend them money and they don't pay me back, I come down hard on them.  They do not get away with it.  Personally,  I've got better things to do with my family and friends.<br>  <br>  Plus, wouldn't your fiance's friend rather relax and enjoy the wedding and partying?|`|xnsU60hhaa	Depends on what you expect from your DJ. Most weddings can be done pretty easily if you have the right equipment. You can program the songs to play when you want them to and just need to stand at the mic for special dances. Also, I am sure a friend would never charge for performing at another friends wedding, so you can save some money. <br>  My daughter was married in Oct last year and the two brothers of the groom took turns with DJ duties. They were also in the wedding party and there weren't any problems at all. In fact it was even better than hiring a DJ because they are so much more knowledgable of the couple. All three brothers are in a band together so they had the proper amplifiers and speakers, all they had to do was hook up a computer. <br>  A couple friends of mine had another friend DJ at their wedding and that went good too. And of course, there was no charge.<br>  I am unsure why you are so uptight. Almost anybody can DJ these days if they have a decent music collection on their computer and some decent amplifiers/speakers.
1TT9oiO0aa	Hmmm. Honestly, from what I've read, I would say this girl is into you, but it's confusing, because she could just be a bit intimidated, like if she does know you like her, and she doesn't actually like you back, she might feel obliged to do things like sit next to you incase you think she doesn't like you even as a friend...hope that doesn't sound too confusing!!<br>  <br>  I think you need to see how this goes. At the end of the day, she could be totally straight and totally uninterested, but she sounds to me like she's curious, so maybe you should carry on with what you're doing now, but whatever you do, don't get TOO intense. If this all goes wrong, she might go back to her friends and say "(your name) won't leave me alone, every time I go into the class she's there dragging me to sit next to her". In a way, you could be exaggerating some things - for example, if I walked into your class and you asked me to sit next to you, I would say "yes", because I'm friendly, you seem a friendly person and it wouldn't be nice of me to turn around and say "no". Do you see where I'm coming from? But I DO genuinely believe she might have a bit of a thing for you, but she seems to be really shy, so just go really slowly and make sure you're CERTAIN she's interested before doing much else about this! :) <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GhbeYkHKaa	I say yes she does|`|uvo24D2gaa	i swear u posted this b4 anyways i think she does like u obvious duhh<br>  <br>  <br>  are you a girl as well|`|THL91lCeaa	do you really think any one can be bothered to read this....<br>  <br>  answer:  no|`|bVQO0BsPaa	Actually mate, I read it.<br>  I think maybe she knows what's going on, and is a bit inquisitive.<br>  Maybe she's bi or bi-curious herself, and is having feelings towards you as well.<br>  Try asking if any of your friends know her, or any people you know know her. Try and find out if she's bi.<br>  I'd keep being nice and friendly towards her, but don't try and push it any further, just in case.<br>  Hope for the best though, she sounds like a really cute girl and so do you.<br>  xx|`|AA10723657	simple answer yes she wants you she is giving off all the signs

Probably just something you ate.

Read Paradise Lost. It is not just a fascinating story of Satan's downfall and plotting from hell, it also talks of the battle before and the life before that battle.<br>  <br>  In it, John Milton basically portrays Satan as the victim and does it so convincingly that the reader identifies with him. However, throughout the novel, Satan begins to become more and more desperate, in his thoughts and actions for revenge, that he is reduced to a shell of his former glory. This is the lesson of the novel. Even though one may identify with the more humanistic qualities of Satan in the beginning, supporting him or any path which does not lead to God eventually makes no sense and reduces oneself to ruin. And that's the point really- to allegorically portray a life lesson(s) one may not simply accept on its own merit. I'm not saying I agree with it, but it is an amazing read. Very visual and almost romantic. Definitely, both of you read this.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	I am interested to read more answers to this,  and I mean proper answers,  not people turning around answering with a question or giving flip statements.     <br>  Why can't this be a respected question?

Satan is just a freedom fighter rising up against the tyranny of an ego maniacal god that demands absolute subjugation.

Satan has gotten a bad reputation because the only piece of literature we have on him was supposedly written by god, and of course god is going to make him out to be the evil one.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	The Gift of Free Will<br>  17 Why would Jehovah let humans go their own way? Because he created them with the marvelous gift of free will, the faculty of freedom of choice. “Where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom,” said the apostle Paul. (2?Corinthians 3:17) No one wants to be a robot, having someone else decide every second of the day what he will say and do. But Jehovah required humans to use that gift of free will responsibly, to see the wisdom of doing his will and remaining subject to him. (Galatians 5:13) So freedom was not to be absolute, as that would result in anarchy. There was to be a regulating of it within the boundaries of God’s benevolent laws.<br>  18 By letting the human family go its own way, God has, once and for all time, demonstrated that we need his rulership. His way of ruling, his sovereignty, is the only right way. It results in the greatest happiness, satisfaction, and prosperity. This is because our minds and bodies were designed by Jehovah to work best when in harmony with his laws. “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.” (Isaiah 48:17) Free choice within the boundaries of God’s laws would not be burdensome but would result in a delightful variety of food, homes, art, and music. Properly exercised, free will would have resulted in a wonderful, ever-fascinating life on a paradise earth.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~If you want to go even further~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Purpose Challenged<br>  4 A spirit son of God rebelled and set out to thwart Jehovah’s purpose, abusing the divine gift of free will. He disturbed the peace that comes to all who manifest loving submission to Jehovah’s sovereignty. Satan led the first human couple to embark on a course of independence from God. (Genesis 3:1-6) He did not deny Jehovah’s power, but he challenged His way of exercising sovereignty and therefore His right to rule. Thus, the fundamental issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty came into focus here on earth, at the very dawn of mankind’s history.<br>  5 Bound up with that primary issue of universal sovereignty is a secondary issue raised by Satan in the days of Job. Satan cast doubt on the motive of Jehovah’s creatures in submitting to Him and serving Him. Satan implied that they were doing so for selfish reasons and that put to the test they would turn against God. (Job 1:7-11; 2:4,?5) While raised in connection with a human servant of Jehovah, this challenge also involved the spirit sons of God, even Jehovah’s only-begotten Son.<br>  6 Faithful to his purpose and to the meaning of his name, Jehovah caused himself to become a Prophet and a Savior. He told Satan: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.” (Genesis 3:15) By means of the Seed of his “woman,” or the heavenly part of his organization, Jehovah would answer Satan’s challenge and provide Adam’s descendants with hope of deliverance and life.—Romans 5:21; Galatians 4:26,?31.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~Why would He allow it?~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Why Allow It?<br>  ‘But why did God let sin and imperfection develop?’ some may ask. ‘Why did he not use his limitless power to get rid of the rebels and start over again?’ That sounds like a simple solution. However, the use of power raises serious questions. Is it not true that abuse of power is one of the main grievances of the poor and oppressed of the world? Does it not raise questions in the minds of righthearted people when some despot uses power to eliminate anyone who disagrees with his policies?<br>  To assure honesthearted ones that He is not a tyrannical abuser of power, God chose to allow Satan and the human rebels to act independently of divine laws and principles—for a limited period of time only. Time would prove that God’s way of ruling is the only right way. It would show that any restrictions he places on us are for our good. In fact, the tragic results of rebellion against God’s rule have already shown that to be true. And they have proved that God is fully justified in using his great power to eliminate all wickedness when he chooses to do so. That will be very soon.—Genesis 18:23-32; Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 37:9, 10,?38.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	There was a lot in her, and I will have to dig back into my Catholic days, but here goes. <br>  First angels do not have free-will (according to the roman catholic bible) they were literally built to worship and do gods bidding. And lucifer was actually one of gods favorite angels. Then one day Lucifer wanted the same power as god. He felt that he was gods equal, obviously god did not feel the same way. So lucifer tried to take the throne away from god. With those 1/3 of gods angels. They fought gods army and the one who actually stopped lucifer was Michael the Arck angel. He sent satan down to hell to live ( the furthest point away from god, hell to christians). <br>  When I was catholic I was always tought that god does love lucifer it is more lucifer is to stubborn or prideful to ask for god's forgiveness (confession) so he stays in hell stewing about what god did to him. But the lesson of the story is god is willing to forgive him he one doesn't realize he was wrong to he just has to ask. <br>  <br>  According to roman catholics, god gave you free will. There is two decisions. Do what god said or the opposite. God can not make you do things. Example, god sucks, I assume that god still left that there and didn't delete it. I had the choice, or free will to write that or not. I do agree that if you do decide to do the other thing( against god) he sends you to hell and thats not right. <br>  <br>  I think you are reading to much into this in the sense that you are going off of the fables that are in place to try and tell a story. This is not "Grey's Anatomy"  there doesn't have to be contenuity if you take each story as a seperate lesson being tought. Not the specifics, but more what lesson should I learn from this story. <br>  <br>  I agree that lucifer is not free because he never had free will. then again this is like arguing did super man have heat vision or laser vision. there made up things to entertain you while you learn something. People get into trouble when they try to make religious fables into fact. <br>  (babel)|`|tAWkYoWJaa	Good question!! <br>  <br>  I have always felt sorry for Lucifer. I mean, he gets such a bad rap and everyone thinks he's "evil". But what did he ever do that was so evil anyway? There are many people in this world now, who are much more evil, (in fact some are truly evil people) than Lucifer ever was. Just because he had his own mind, his own ideas, and his own opinions (that didn't agree with God's), people think he's this horrible, evil creature. <br>  What is the point of having free-will if it comes not without obligations? Our free-will is not "free" at all, since we must use it to honour and praise God. Pretty much any other use of our free-will is considered sinful and punishable with a one-way, no return ticket to Hell. Then again, I fail to see why Hell would be such a "bad" place anyway. But that's for another discussion.<br>  <br>  EDIT: jkjb3 is absolutely right. "Paradise Lost" is a perfect example of the Lucifer story told from a different perspective. Milton did a wonderful job of portraying Lucifer as the victim and the reader easily emphasizes and pities the poor guy. After all, it is only fair to try and hear a story from both sides. <br>  Of course, Milton's story is fictional, but I am sure there are many people who would also say the Bible is fictional. Sorry to offend anyone with that comment. I just think the only way to really find truth is to listen to as many possible view points as possible, and then draw your own conclusions based on what you have heard.|`|wnpcdfMWaa	First, God gave us free will so that we could choose what we wanted to do but we do not get to choose the consequences.<br>  <br>  Before we were born in this earth we lived with God and were preparing to come to this earth, sure we praised Him but thats not ALL that we did neither were we forced to do so because we had free will since the time our spirits were created.<br>  <br>  With these free will what Lucifer and 1/3 of the angels in heaven (spirits like we all were) had, they decided to not accept the Plan of Salvation presented to everyone in heaven where Jesus Christ would be our Saviour and give all the glory to the Father, instead Satan WANTED to be the Saviour and force everyone to be good and take the glory and power for himself, thus eliminating our heavenly given gift of free will. This is were the consequences came, everyone who accepted the plan with Jesus Christ as our Saviour was given or will eventually be given a mortal body to come to earth, Lucifer or Satan and the 1/3 of the angels in heaven were thrown out of heaven and not given a mortal body. <br>  <br>  Now, think as a if you were a parent, what is the best way to teach your children what is good for them so they will know for themselves and experience true happiness? Should a parent not set up rules and consequences for breaking them or disobeying? Wouldnt he do this out of love instead of letting them have whatever they want? Look at society today and see what happens when children get ALL that they want.<br>  <br>  I know that our Heavenly Father loves us and thats why He gaves us this plan to come to earth so that we can grow and perfect ourselves to go back to Him in heaven. It hurts him to see people choose evil but if he were to force us to do good then it would be to take away our free will, we would not know sadness therefore neither would we know happiness.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help you understand a little more. The bible sometimes is not clear on some things or just doesnt include the whole story. I encourage you to continue to seek answers and pray about this so that you will receive an answer from the main source who knows it all, our Heavenly Father.

pqveENjUaa	I think that the thread you are referencing and so angry about sounded like a legitimate, plausible explanation for homosexuality. As human beings, we are always trying to explain things. To some historians, that is why religion even exists. Now I have a few gay friends, and one of them in particular wishes desperately that he was attracted to women because he is sick and tired of being persecuted everywhere he goes. I'm positive that in his case it isn't a choice. He even agreed with the post you referenced, as did my other gay friends. <br>  <br>  You know, you are absolutely right with your approach here. Psychology is not 100% nature or nurture. And the genetics haven't been proven to guarantee homosexuality or heterosexuality, and instead seem to show a preference one way or another. I personally would love to know what causes homosexuality, just the same as I wanted to know why my hair was brown and my eyes were blue. Sheer curiosity.<br>  <br>  I apologize if J.P. angered you in any way. I don't think he really meant to anger the homosexual population, and instead I think he genuinely intended to help end persecution of homosexuals by offering a plausible scientific explanation of homosexuality to keep religious people from declaring it a sin. <br>  <br>  If you don't mind me asking, why do you think you are gay?

It's like a communication between your spirit and the Spirit of God working inside of you. You don't feel it. You don't see it. You can't taste it, and you can't hear it as if someone is talking to you face to face. But you know it is there, and you know what it is when it does come to you. My first experience of the Holy Spirit being with me came when I was 18 years old. I was dating my first true love at the time. I went over to her house one day to see her and I heard some noise coming from her house. I knocked a few times. No one answered, so I went around back. She was sleeping on the couch. I went back around to the front and checked on the door. It was unlocked. I went to try to wake her up, but she wouldn't wake up. I knew something wasn't right. I went into the kitchen, grabbed a butcher knife than went into her bedroom. I went to open up the closet, and I heard a voice within me said leave. I wasn't a follower or a believer at the time. When I went to turn the knob, I heard the voice tell me to leave again but it was louder. I looked around since I have never heard the voice before. I just went and took the knife into the kitchen and left. Kim told me two days later that her ex boyfriend was in the closet. No it was not him telling me to leave, because I knew his voice. It was not a out voice but a inner voice. God has spoken to me through communication after that a few times. So this is when I know that the Holy Spirit is in me. What does Jesus say, you shall no my voice.|`|AA11142708	My most recent relationship with the Holy Spirit took place yesterday--but it is the result of many years of deliberation on my relationship with divinity. What I came up with yesterday probably won't make much sense here, but as you can imagine, when you have an original thought you want to communicate it. The following is the last paragraph in what I wrote yesterday. In that form it is probably not going to make sense, but here it is anyway. (My concern here is how is logic connected to divinity). After many years of questioning, I can't even begin to express what this means to me emotionally. Thanks for the question.<br>  <br>  So, in a nutshell, (and in my opinion) here is the substance of what I am alluding to with the above concept of transformations. 0, in the form of 1/0 and 0/1, is akin to the Buddhist concept sunyata (form/emptiness, emptiness/form), only this concept when it is couched in the above “logic of existence,” brings God  back into the picture, -- God being the source of the formula. On the next lower level, or the level 0/1, -- the level of life and death, the meaning and significance of death rises exponentially. When death is understood as a necessary bridge to truth, (truth gets liberated in the transformation 1/0 and 0/1), death looses, so to speak, its teeth, as it becomes a necessary link in the process that culminates in what becomes the experience of thinking thoughts. And, on the last level, the level of -1/1, another Buddhist concept can be recognized—the concept of the connectivity of all existence. Once again, a more powerful significance latches onto this concept of connectivity. Although, this is only speculation, I believe some of the “strangeness” of quantum phenomena—observer generated collapse of the wave equation, the quantum entanglement phenomena, etc.—would seem more “rational” when understood from within this perspective of the “logic of existence."|`|UI79JnJVaa	"You would know the difference....<br>  <br>   ....between the truth and a Lie."|`|AA10674998	Holy Spirit causes holy living.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	what Chris said.

There are exceptions which are granted based on circumstance.<br>  Yes - Catholics can read the bible for themselves.  The correct interpretation of the bible is announced from the pulpit in the Catholic Church, as in others, by the Church Leaders or in writings by its leadership.<br>  <br>  Now, after that, it is open to argument and opionion.<br>  Martin Luther pretty dramatically took the church he perceived that Jesus wanted and built it into the modern day Lutheran Church.  The reformation was pretty much the idea that the Catholic Church had marched too far away from Jesus and needed new and correct management.<br>  Catholics are rather certain that the church has remained faithful to Jesus command.<br>  The Puritans, and later day Baptists believe everyone had it wrong and took a more literal interpretation of Jesus commands than arguably the other Protestant or Catholic faithful.<br>  <br>  Christianity became so skewed and divided because of interpretation,  pratical application, corruption from the local to top levels of the Catholic Church, power (in the case of King Henry the 6th and the founding of the Anglican church) and the ever favorite money.  <br>  <br>  I believe there are several million different views to all your questions and a lifetime of study.

Since Jesus is now no longer among humans, it's back to the old days of speaking through priests and sacraments. We can ask Jesus ourselves but for some reason this is less effective, don't ask me why. And Catholics follow the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is more like a set of rules than a separate bible, if that's what you meant.|`|9BeUbORtaa	It depends what you mean by a 'relationship.' Yes, Catholics commit themselves personally to Christ, and have a very strong sense of Jesus as a living person in their lives. But whereas evangelicals have a rather 'pally' attitude towards God - although he were just an invisible friend - Catholics have a strong sense of God's majesty and complete transcendence. Catholics stress the power and lordship of God, and his complete 'otherness' to human beings. however, unlike hardline Protestants, the also stress the immanence of God, and especially his humanity in Jesus. For this reason, any "relationship" Catholics imagine themselves entering into with God will certainly not be anything like the very close, personal kind of relationship evangelicals describe. It is a relationship that will emphasise the lordship of God, and the subservience of human beings to His will. Consequently, the more immanent side of the divine identity in Catholic thought is often mediated not just by the human person of Jesus, but by His Mother and the communion of saints. <br>  <br>  As far as Scripture goes, Catholics tend to be more suspicious about individual interpretation of Scripture than Protestants are. This is not because they think priests or scholars have a monopoly upon the correct understanding of Scripture, but because they recognise that, when people who may not know very much about Biblical theology read the Bible, they often discover that Scripture says what they want to hear, or they jump to simple or illogical conclusions by taking passages out of context. The word of Scripture is too precious to be treated in such a way. Instead it must be read intelligently and carefully, and (Catholics believe) in the light of the historic teachings of the Church through the ages. Of course, people who are not priests or scholars can read Scripture intelligently and carefully, but Catholics might well observe that enthusiastic evangelicals sometimes appear to read Scripture prolifically, but without either intelligence or caution.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I have read the Bible and nowhere does it say ask Jesus into your heart.<br>  <br>  Yes the Catholic Bible is different, it has more books than other versions.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	John did dear...|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	A lot of what you say is from an old play book and a misunderstanding.<br>  <br>  1.

In the first few hundred years most people could not read, so it was necessary that there be an institution to lead the believers.

A good catholic will refer to protestants as his christian brethren.|`|wND7qPTWaa	With God, nothing is impossible.<br>   If we can believe in the incredible reality of the Incarnation, we can certainly believe in the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. <br>  God coming to us in elements He created is an extension of the awesome mystery of the Incarnation. <br>  <br>  "For the blood of the grape--that is, the Word--desired to be mixed with water, as His blood is mingled with salvation. And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual, that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh. Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man. And the one, the mixture of wine and water, nourishes to faith; while the other, the Spirit, conducts to immortality. And the mixture of both--of the water and of the Word--is called Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake of it are sanctified both in body and soul." Clement of Alexandria<br>  <br>  The Eucharist is "THE "personal relationship with Jesus Christ, not just "A" personal relationship.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, the difference is *primarily* a semantic one.  Most especially, you will never find a Roman Catholic (I don't think) who says, "Jesus is my personal lord and savior".  Quite frankly, I agree with them on this point.  Jesus is not a set of golf clubs.  If he is your "personal" lord and savior, that means everyone else is going to Hell, doesn't it?  What's that?  You're willing to share him?  That's awfully nice of you - but what happens when you share him with someone else and he becomes *that* persons "personal lord and savior"?  At that point, you'd have to try and get him back, wouldn't you?<br>  <br>  My point is (I hope it's clear) that the differences YOU mention are strictly semantic differences.  Roman Catholics do *not* (in general) use terms such as "born again", "personal relationship with Jesus", "personal lord and savior".<br>  <br>  I was raised in a marginally (minimally) Roman Catholic family.  We went to church twice a year whether we needed it or not.  I remember once, as a child of about 10, being asked by someone (at a Baptist children's weekend camp - I was there with my friend) - - - "Do you accept Jesus as your personal lord and savior"?  I was dumbfounded.  My thoughts (which I kept to myself) were, "Well, is there anyone else?"  My answer was "yes" - but my point is that such wording appears foolish to a Roman Catholic.  And it *still* seems foolish to me, a Fundamentalist Christian who always thinks of the English definition of a word before the weirdly specialized Protestant definition.<br>  <br>  Another important point:  the previous pope wrote about his own experience of becoming "born again".  This concept is **by no means** foreign to Roman Catholicism.  However, it is *not* indoctrinated into members, and (with this concept in particular) is not emphasized because "born again" implies a change from someone **outside** of Christianity being born **into** Christianity.  Since many Roman Catholics are raised within the church from infancy, "born again" is inconsequential - it is something that happened (for them) at such a young age that they can no longer recall a time when they were not Christians.  They have, in a sense, "always" believed devoutly in the "saving power" of Jesus.  Like me as a child, they might respond, "Well, who else is there?"<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|0fnzDpKXaa	Well, first, the priest doesn't absolve you of sin.  They believe God does that.  I think the whole "personal one on one relationship with Christ" thing is a practice of fundamentalist Christians, similar to being "born again" and "saved", none of which is a concept the Catholics embrace - these are all relatively new things that evangelicals have come up with.<br>  <br>  The Catholic bible has seven additional books.  The books were later removed by Martin Luther, but the Catholics have left them alone.|`|8OeulLkmaa	catholics do not believe in the writing's of Paul the Apostle.

Then my Father will love him, and we will go to him and make our home within him.|`|HMteUyRdaa	1) I am a Catholic, this is why we confess to a Priest. Christ ordained 11 Priests at the Last Supper but before the Last Supper, He sent His 12 Apostles out into the world and this is what He said (Gospel of St.John Chapter 20:21 He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you. 22 When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. 23 Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.<br>  <br>  2) The Catholic Definition of Salvation is to be saved through the Life, Death and Resurrection of Christ our Lord and Redeemer. <br>  <br>  3) We invite Christ into our hearts every time we receive our Lord at Mass or offer up a Spiritual Communion. Christ gave us the Holy Eucharist because the Everlasting Covenant was Him in the Most Blessed Sacrament.(Gospel of St.Matthew 26:26 And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body. 27 And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this. 28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins. 29 And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father. 30 And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet. <br>  26 "This is my body"... He does not say, This is the figure of my body, but This is my body. (2 Council of Nice, Act. 6.) Neither does he say in this, or with this is my body; but absolutely, This is my body: which plainly implies transubstantiation. <br>  <br>  4)The Catholic bible has 7 more books known as the * The 7 Deutero-<br>  Canonical books, erroneously called "The Apocrypha",by some people.<br>  These books prove the Divinity of Christ beyond all doubt.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Of course, and we do.<br>  <br>  We are intimately connected to Jesus through the Eucharist also.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	yes|`|5CuN9h20aa	God absolves the sin, He just uses the priest to do it. Kinda like when people heal the sick, it's not really the person healing them it is God.<br>  <br>  The Bible says to confess your sins to one another, (James 5:16).<br>  Jesus also told the apostles what they bound on earth would be bound in heaven, what they loosed on earth would be loosed in heaven. (Matt 16:18-19)<br>  <br>  Look at confession this way, it does you good to have to confess your wrongs to another person. It puts some humility in you and is also a good way to examine your actions. Imagine if you had to sit before Christ and tell him all the wrongs you had done. Well you wouldn't want to be in that position again. You probably wouldn't do the same things again.<br>  <br>  From what I understand Catholics believe salvation is an ongoing process. It isn't split second. <br>  <br>  Catholics look at the Bible in it's entirety, not verse for verse. I can pick out a verse anywhere and make it say what I want it to say. But when you look at the Bible in it's entirety it says something totally different. Catholics have Bible studies and they all share the same core beliefs. They are allowed to own Bibles and read them, but look what individual interpretation has done. There are over 33,000 Protestant denominations all reading the same Bible and preaching something different.<br>  <br>  And yes the Catholic Bible has more books, 7 I think, in the Old Testament. These books were in the original KJV (along with all the Saint's days). A lot of people don't know that.<br>  <br>  I don't think any Catholic on here would claim that the Church has never had any problems, but there are a lot of lies that are told about the Catholic church and what they believe. I have been attending Mass for a couple of months now and I have never walked into a church where I felt more reverence for God. These people don't have to feel it, they live it. I am starting RCIA classes this fall. I would suggest you find your local Parish.

Baptists might tell you otherwise, but the Catholic church has been there LONG before the Protestants came around. <br>  <br>  So, that being said, Catholicism, like Christianity, focuses on the whole Trinity, Jesus for salvation belief system. No different, except for what Protestants call "more elaborate rituals" and the like, including sacrements, communion, but other than that its really no different as it has the core teachings of Christ involved. <br>  <br>  Do Catholics use a different bible? Well they (tend to) use the Douay-Rheims, or all 76 books of the canon bible, so yes they do use writings and scriptures that Protestants have left out and deemed non-canon. <br>  <br>  And no, Priests are only there as clergy, no one worships the Pope or thinks Priests are everything. They believe in free will and personal spiritual relations with God. <br>  <br>  This is coming from someone who was raised Catholic and have family members who are devout Catholics. They'll tell you the same thing (but probably go into more detail since they still practice the faith).

Ex 20:8-11 KJV|`|p5cglKf0aa	FIRST POINT<br>  <br>  Through the light of belief, man rises to the highest of the high and acquires a value worthy of Paradise. And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the Dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the Dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison:<br>  <br>  For example: among man's arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are entirely different. Sometimes they are equal, sometimes the material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that five dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which it is composed is not worth five cents. And so, if such a work of art is taken to the antiques market and related to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million dollars. Whereas if it is taken to the scrap dealers, the only price received will be for the five cent's worth of iron.Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to manifest all his Names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaningful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, he causes others to read them. That is to say, the Dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, "I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His mercy and munificence." That is, belief, which consists of being connected to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man's value is in accordance with that Dominical art, and by virtue of being a mirror to the Eternally Besought One. In this respect insignificant man becomes God's addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise superior to all other creatures.However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the relation, enter man's being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into darkness and cannot be read. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts and elevated inscriptions will be hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen with the eye, will be attributed to lowly causes, Nature, and chance, and will fall utterly from value. While each is a brilliant diamond, each becomes a piece of dull glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physical being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of animals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into coal.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  SECOND POINT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&t=First+Chapter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&...</a>|`|HbCWNCQzaa	its not about loving the law....i love GOD enough to follow his laws because his laws are meant to bring us closer to him and to live a meaningful life|`|t88527U1aa	I love Gods grace and mercy given by Christ on the cross,as a sinner I try to follow his teachings I fail.|`|yRAU9MJDaa	No.  People can only love beings.
ClQCFsqOaa	Seems like calling the secretary the "Resident Gopher Whore" is not really appreciated.|`|agLImxKTaa	Administrative Assistants do a lot for you.  They take c r a p for you and from you.  They do all the nasty little things you don't want to do for yourself so who do you think you are saying they don't need a holiday?  They deserve some kind of respect for what they do all year long.  And BTW, I am NOT an admin asst.  I just have a lot of respect for mine.|`|u7JJcFbnaa	I am a "secretary" or administrative assistant if you will.  It does not bother me when someone refers to me as a secretary.  Call me what you may.

Being skinny is not the same as being healthy and being fat is not healthy. So, they are both wrong.<br>  <br>  Learn how to spell, "hi"!<br>  <br>  Also, I can tell that you are someone who enjoys insulting a person who isn't like you or might look different.

Now i know some are a medical problem and can not do it. <br>  <br>  And the fat people call out the skinny people because society makes them feel out of place so it makes them feel better about themselves. <br>  <br>  But yeah i hate it when fat people call me skinny.

IMO abortion is wrong.... or at least the method is... But if it's the mother in danger, like if she keeps the baby she'll probably die then yeah it should be done....|`|wcOq60Hhaa	In the first 15 weeks, her body, her choice -- no wrong in any important sense.<br>  <br>  In the second 15 weeks,  sure...do the math if it makes you feel better.|`|po4j4xhAaa	If a woman gets an abortion for ANY reason it is NOT wrong.<br>  <br>  It is her body and her choice.

They can explain where the problems are in the mind, i.e. the frontal lobe, but they can't explain exactly what it is or why it happens. There is a connection there, but because science and religion are so opposed, we'll never know for sure.<br>  My nephew has been on all different kinds of meds, and they don't work. I believe if he turned to Jesus he would be freed from his personal demons. It worked for me. Jesus saves. But no one wants to hear the TRUTH.|`|QnH9QuQwaa	Sometimes very little, sometimes a lot.  Very little is known about this matter and few can agree on any consensus.<br>  <br>  Those who don't believe in possession have never witnessed one.  <br>  <br>  Schizophrenia and possession are often confused with each other.  But Schizophrenia is usually a genetic occurance triggered by either a stressful event or by drugs.  It usually affects the person for the rest of their life.  But possession is usually something that happens once and isn't bound by age.<br>  Schizophrenia starts in the teen years and early 20's.  Possession happens out of the blue.  It doesn't depend on an age.<br>  But some believe that a Schizophrenic person may be more susceptible to possession or influence.   While Schizophrenia isn't the same as multiple personality disorder, some sufferers completely change their personality for a period of time.  I have met a few Schizophrenics, and one case stood out.  She was an Atheist who started acting very odd.  After a month of acting odd, she snapped.  She kept saying very odd religious and scary things to people.  When I got to her she was able to comment on conversations that I just had.... downtown a few minutes ago.  She is still a Schizophrenic, but to this day she hasn't acted like that.  We prayed for her (outside of the hospital) and the next day she was much better.   But to this day she still acts very odd and says simple religious ideals out of the blue.   But she has yet to return to being that scary, patient, graceful, and knowledgeable identity.<br>  I see now I'm just wasting my time here.  But let's just summarize my studies as such.  1.  Schizophrenia is a mental condition assumed to be caused by the frontal lobes and the poor balance in dopamine.  2.  Most families that had a possession happen in their family don't want to talk about it.  The victims themselves rarely talk about it.  As one woman told me, having someone control your every move is a lot like rape.  Who enjoys talking about being raped?  Due to this, it's hard to ever get reliable accounts of possession.  3.  Schizophrenics may be more susceptible to possession and demonic influence, but they aren't necessarily possessed nor even influenced.  But there is no cure for Schizophrenia, although a few do come out of it but not with any known medication.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	the mindset of the person making the diagnosis|`|RedEGIfZaa	Nothing.

Basically it put a price on everyone's head, and if you killed that person, then you had to pay that price to their family, or they had the right to kill you.  It acted as a deterrent to killing people.  I'm assuming that this is what the bible is referring to.  Probably under 1 month old there was quite a high possibility of them dying anyway.|`|XxWovDNCaa	Child mortality at the time meant that you didn't get too attached to newborns.|`|5aqYVyvAaa	Good question!!!

Your eyes saw even the embryo of me<br>  <br>  Ex. 21:22-25 talks about if two men are having a fight and a fatal accident occurs to either her or the baby the payment is soul for soul.<br>  <br>  It looks like to me that God considers an embryo a living person from the moment of conception.<br>  <br>  The only other reason I can think of as to why in Lev it's 1 month is that many babies died back then during birth or shortly after due to medical complications. They didn't have the technology as we do now. As with any law; there has to be a cut off point. I guess surviving the first month was the determining factor back then if the baby is going to have a fighting chance at growing up or not. <br>  <br>  But as Ps and Ex brings out God does value everyone even the ones who aren't born yet. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!!!
vDGFRACaaa	Personally I feel that the protagonist tries to change the world, but quickly realizes that the world is unchangable. This motif slowly reveals itself as the story reaches it's climax in that most dramatic conflict, and the denouement lets the character accept this as a fact of life, to become happier from it. Because like the title of the story says, "No Witchcraft for Sale".
XZKh86qsaa	Voice of conscience is merely a thought.  Our only obligation is exactly what is right here and right now.  When we are true to ourselves we have no such dilemma.  When we see the thoughts as merely unreal assumptions and products of conditioning we come closer to the experience of simply being aware of ourselves exactly as we are.  There is no effort and nothing easier than when we see what is and understand that we are not controlling Life but that Life is controlling us.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	It is a suggestion....one makes the free will choice to listen then act.|`|p5cglKf0aa	FIRST POINT<br>  <br>  Through the light of belief, man rises to the highest of the high and acquires a value worthy of Paradise. And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the Dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the Dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison:<br>  <br>  For example: among man's arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are entirely different. Sometimes they are equal, sometimes the material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that five dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which it is composed is not worth five cents. And so, if such a work of art is taken to the antiques market and related to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million dollars. Whereas if it is taken to the scrap dealers, the only price received will be for the five cent's worth of iron.Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to manifest all his Names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaningful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, he causes others to read them. That is to say, the Dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, "I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His mercy and munificence." That is, belief, which consists of being connected to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man's value is in accordance with that Dominical art, and by virtue of being a mirror to the Eternally Besought One. In this respect insignificant man becomes God's addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise superior to all other creatures.However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the relation, enter man's being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into darkness and cannot be read. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts and elevated inscriptions will be hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen with the eye, will be attributed to lowly causes, Nature, and chance, and will fall utterly from value. While each is a brilliant diamond, each becomes a piece of dull glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physical being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of animals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into coal.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  SECOND POINT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&t=First+Chapter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&...</a>|`|4M2eNSb5aa	Consciousness is the real ruler of any individual being.<br>  Even mind derives it's energies from consciousness.<br>  So conscience, which is a form of consciousness, lies above mind.<br>  That is why anything coming from conscience acts like an obligation rather than suggestion which along with thoughts form integral part of our mind that lying below.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i don't know in what way you are asking this question.<br>  but the bible mentions that you must train your conscience to learn right from wrong.<br>  so i guess it's an obligation because that's the only way you are prevented from doing anything.<br>  i.e people who grow up with thieves, don't feel anything when they steal, that's because their conscience wasn't programed to think that stealing is a bad thing. and a person who grew up with morals and was taught that stealing was wrong, will feel guilty when stealing.<br>  i don't know if this was what you meant by your question but i hope it helps.|`|vmv1rP76aa	Hmm...because our higher selves always answer to God's will whether we know it or not.

I believe that the conscience is a result of a moral code which everyone is born with.  This moral code is universal, and intrinsic to everyone.  For example, some cultures believe that you should have only one wife, others believe that you can have several, but no culture believes it's ok the take any woman anytime you wish.<br>  <br>  This moral law is outlined in the Law of God, as found in the Bible, and is reinforced by the power of the Holy Spirit (literally: Breath of God) influencing your life.  Obeying your conscience, the moral law, brings fulfillment and peace to you and those in your sphere of influence, while disobeying your conscience brings pain and suffering.<br>  <br>  The Law of God is an obligation, but it is also a delight.  It is not arbitrary.  Those who do as they please, devoid of any moral compass are never happy people.  <br>  <br>  Ironically, humanity in its sinful state is incapable of keeping the Law of God without being in relationship with Him.  It is by this relationship that we obtain the power to obey our conscience and live in peace and happiness.|`|21898b74c3cdf0c81a7fdfcafa48e63eaa	True.

He seats you at a table adjacent to a window to the sidewalk where passing by,  the poor children of the town, see you and your family eating and enjoying a meal.  Since it is meal time, sure enough, the proprietor has set a tourista up and he, as usual, serves fourteen meals instead of just four to the touristas. Ah, these touristas are so rich and so gullible.  By the way, did any of those poor begging children address the proprietor as Papa ?  When you operate a cafe in Mexico and have a large family you find ways to feed that large family.  The touristas make that problem an easy one to handle.  Go back to that restraurant sometime and ask for a table away from the window and watch some other tourista feed the poor children.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	My son gave money to children in Mexico, he and his partner, took soap, toothpaste, and a lot of stuff that was hard to get to Cuba, as presents for the hotel staff who worked there.<br>  He bought me jewelery,  when he was in India,<br>  that was made by the local people, and he said there was a lot of poverty in some of the places he has been.<br>  And we in the west should stop moaning so much, as compared to some we were well off.|`|AA12038658	Once again, I have never experienced this, but we have had people in <br>  America going to dumpsters outside of supermarkets to get the bread & other bakery goods they throw out.

Did you both have an understanding that it was a loan and when it would be paid back? Two grand is a lot for most people. <br>   <br>  And what did they say the loan was for?

If they said they needed to make rent and would pay you back, ASAP - you better believe I would call them on the luxury spending. <br>  <br>  My in-laws I have no illusions about. If we lend them money we won't be seeing a penny of it again. They don't consider ciggies, junk food and booze luxury items but necessities.  My MIL loaned my BIL several thousand dollars and it went to the same place your BIL's loan went I guess. <br>  <br>  She's retired, and never said anything to him when he never paid her back, so now she's just sore about it.

zNGZ2X7Maa	Thanks for reposting the question it is such an important question!!<br>  <br>  Again my answer would not post, so I will try it with only the scripture references instead of writing out the full passage.  Maybe my answer is too long?<br>  <br>  While there are multiple types of baptism found in the word of God (ie: with the Holy Spirit), in the interest of space constraints I will focus on one type: water baptism.<br>  <br>  The word of God teaches us that baptism a very important part of our salvation and relationship with our Messiah.  Here is why I say that:<br>  <br>  First let me establish that it is the word of God that is truth (Psalm 33:4,  119:41-45, 160, 138:2, John 17:17, 2Cor. 6:7, Eph 1:13, 2Tim. 2:13, James 1:18-25) and that God is true, but every man is a liar (Rom 3:4, Num 23:19).  Also notice that in James we read that we are to be doers (obeyers) of the word and not hearers only, otherwise we deceive ourselves.  Notice also that we are blessed IF we continue in the word of God and we are begotten of God by His word and only His word.  Jesus (Yeshua) made the statement the we must believe on Him AS THE SCRIPTURES SAY (John 7:38).<br>  <br>  So then, having said that let me continue:<br>  <br>  John 3:3-7 <br>  Mark 16:15-16 : (Note: belief is a condition of baptism.  With out belief getting baptized only gets you wet.)<br>  Mat 28:19-20 : (Note: it is the name, singular,  not the names, plural)<br>  Luke 24:45-47<br>  Acts 2:36-42  <br>  ACTS 10:42-48  <br>  Acts 8:35-38 : (Note: why did the eunuch ask Philip about baptism?  Could it be that since Philip, as one of the apostles, was obedient to the scriptures he preached baptism as part of preaching Jesus to him?)<br>  <br>  Why is baptism not just an "outward profession of an inward confession", but rather an integral part of the born again experience?<br>  <br>  Mark 1:2-5<br>  Luke 12:50 : (Note: Even Jesus, as man, had to be covered by His blood.)<br>  Rom 6:3-6<br>  Col 2:6-15 : (Note: we are buried with the Messiah in baptism and join Him in His death so that we may join Him in new life.  The old man, sinful nature, handwriting of ordinances, is nailed to and crucified on the cross with Him.  Also note the statement in Colossians regarding Him forgiving our sins by baptism and how that relates to Acts 2:38, Luke 24:47.  Scripture builds upon scripture; precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.)<br>  <br>  I won't go listing all the scriptures for this next point because there are simply so many I could go on and on and on......  1Cor 5:7 states that Messiah is our passover sacrificed for us.  the scriptures also tell us that He is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world and the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.  The passover lamb had to be killed and drained of its blood before it could be partaken of.  Also, on the first passover that blood had to be applied to the doorposts of the dwellings of those who partook of the passover.  The scriptures plainly tell us that we dwell in earthly tabernacles called our bodies (flesh).  The blood of the Passover Lamb must be applied to our dwellings too.  Now compare that with Luke 12:50 and Col 2:14 (as well as the many scriptures relating to His suffering and crucifixion).  We see that His blood covered Him when He was crucified, it had to be spilled out before we could partake of the sacrificed Lamb, and it will blot out (cover up) and take out of the way our sins that are against us and those sins are nailed to that cross with our Messiah.  How does that happen?  the scriptures tell us it is in baptism when we believe, repent and obey the scriptures.<br>  <br>  A bit long, I know.  But, you wanted scriptures for baptism, not what I think.  I could list many more scripture references regarding this (some have been referenced by others already), but I think one could get the point here by what is given.<br>  <br>  Thanks again for asking this question and making the requirement of giving scripture for what baptism means.

With out belief getting baptized only gets you wet.)<br>  <br>  Luke 24:45-47 <br>  45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, <br>  46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: <br>  47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  Acts 2:36-42 <br>  36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. <br>  37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? <br>  38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>  39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. <br>  40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. <br>  41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. <br>  42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. <br>  <br>  Acts 10:42-48 <br>  42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. <br>  43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. <br>  44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. <br>  45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>  46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, <br>  47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? <br>  48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. <br>  <br>  Acts 8:35-38 <br>  35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. <br>  36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? <br>  37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. <br>  38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. <br>  (Note: why did the eunuch ask Philip about baptism? Could it be that since Philip, as one of the apostles, was obedient to the scriptures he preached baptism as part of preaching Jesus to him?)<br>  <br>  Mark 1:2-5 <br>  2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <br>  3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. <br>  4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. <br>  5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.<br>  <br>  Luke 12:50 <br>  But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! <br>  (Note: Even Jesus, as man, had to be covered by His blood.)<br>  <br>  Romans 6:3-6 <br>  3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? <br>  4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. <br>  5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: <br>  6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be des|`|k7FD3rt5aa	......our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and the sea;<br>  <I Corinthians 10:1-2><br>  <br>  *Added* I will try to add more scriptures to this.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Instances of being saved by water:<br>  OT<br>  And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes.......and wash himself in water, that he may be clean<Leviticus 14:8><br>  NT<br>  I indeed baptize you with water to repentance....<Matthew 3:11><br>  <br>  Water has always been necessary for cleansing.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Far too many people are under the impression that baptism by water is what all baptism refers to in the Bible. But those who have received only a baptism by water have no more chance of salvation then men did before the time of Jesus. <br>  <br>  Jesus tells us that in order to see the Kingdom of Heaven (achieve salvation) we must be baptized in the Holy Ghost. <br>  "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again." (John 3:3-7)<br>  <br>  Remember first that John was baptizing people by water before the cross. He said:<br>  "I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. " (Mark 1:8) <br>  <br>  Baptism by water was a temporary solution to the permanent problem of sin, long before the time of Jesus Christ. Baptism of the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ, on the other hand, is the only permanent solution to the problem of sin, and whether or not people admit it, we all have a mountain of sin in our lives. And regarding that mountain Jesus Himself said:<br>  "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible." (Matt 19:26)<br>  <br>  Only through the indwelling Holy Ghost can we free ourselves of sin (completely repent) and know the Kingdom of God. <br>  <br>  This is why I worry for those who claim they are Christians because they were baptized in water (some only as infants) and believe they are saved but mock those of us who admit we are "born again".

vhlORK4Waa	Indigo chid is a horrible euphemism for pampered spoilt brats in my experience, limited as that is. If a child is mean, then they will be a mean teen.<br>  <br>  In the New Age movement, indigo children are children who are believed to represent a higher state of human evolution. The term itself is a reference to the belief that such children have an indigo-colored aura.<br>  <br>  Beliefs concerning the exact nature of indigo children vary, with some believing that they have paranormal abilities such as the ability to read minds, and others that they are distinguished from non-indigo children merely by more conventional traits such as increased empathy and creativity.<br>  <br>  There is no scientific support for these claims.<br>  <br>  The term indigo children originates from the 1982 book Understanding Your Life Through Color, by Nancy Ann Tappe, a self-styled synesthete and psychic, who claimed to possess the ability to perceive human auras. She wrote that during the mid 1960s she began noticing that many children were being born with indigo auras. Today she estimates that 60% of people age 14 to 25 and 97% of children under ten are "indigo."<br>  <br>  The idea of indigo children was later popularized by the 1998 book The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived, written by the husband-and-wife team of Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. According to Carroll he learned about the concept of indigo children while channeling a being known as Kryon, Master angelic energy. Tober has said that she and Carroll do not talk much about Kryon in interviews because they see this as being a potential barrier to reaching more mainstream audiences that exist outside of the New Age movement. Imagine that?!<br>  <br>  <br>  Halcon

eus7WqzUaa	Ummm...from a girls point of view.  Get it done.<br>  <br>  And a male can still feel pleasure after being circumcised.  If a female is-she cannot.  There is a big difference.  Call me what you want, but a uncircumcised penis looks like a big tan/black earthworm.<br>  <br>  The body doesn't need it.  Just like we don't need an appendix.  It just causes problems.<br>  <br>  Trust me, his future wife will want it done.  Just like most of the men that still have their foreskin would want a women to get breast implants-yet they say it is not ok for you to take care of it now when he is young and won't remember.  If you live in America don't make him confused when he is younger and hide in gym class because he looks different.<br>  <br>  I wonder why all the women are telling you yes and all the self conscious men are telling you no.  I only heard one good reason for a women to like it and that is rare.  Think about his future.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Well my boyfriend isn't circumcised and is very glad he isn't. It's natural that way. He's never had a problem and never considered getting it done. He wouldn't do it to a son either. Considering 80% of men in the world aren't circumcised I'm guesing most men are like this.<br>  <br>  The thing is, yes your son could want the opposite of what you've chosen, so why not leave him the choice?<br>  <br>  If you leave him intact he'll probably be happy, if not, he can get circumcised. Adults get better pain relief as a baby, and it's there choice.<br>  <br>  By contrast if you circumcise him and he's unhappy, there's nothing he can do. He'll never get that body part back. Loads of men resent it. Check out <a href="http://www.norm.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.norm.org</a> they are doing foreskin restoration but it's not the same as the real thing.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and it depends on the guy's age. A lot of people talking about locker rooms and stuff are going on old information - when the circumcision rate was 85% a guy might have felt glad he was, but now it's only 50%, there's a much higher chance a guy will feel resentment about his loss.<br>  <br>  So personally I would rather leave my boy with the default status and let him choose. The chances of him having a medical foreskin issue are very rare and probably less common than a complication from the circumcision. Not to mention it's painful for the baby!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AA11987492	I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis.... they are the ones that are missing parts<br>  <br>  One of the worst things you can do as a mother, is give your child cosmetic surgery to make them "fit in". Basically, you are saying, there is something wrong with you, you had to be fixed, and you should base your self esteem on what others think of you". Actions speak louder than words you know. If you are doing it because "That is what everyone else is doing" All I am going to say is, don't ever say no to your kids when they want to do something that is harmful to their health and they just want to fit in. Kids come home drunk or high? No problem, they just wanted to be "normal", You don't want them to be teased do you?????<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Boys can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|MlCNh5cmaa	Only girls think that circumcising boys is a good idea. Lucky for them they never have to go through that. I'm circumcised myself but I would never do that to my son. I wish I had my foreskin back but what's done is done. How about having your son make that decision since it is HIS body? Vaginas look "gross" too but we don't practice circumcision on girls! Who cares what it looks like, it's a friggin PENIS! How about what the kid wants (or doesn't want done) to his body? By the way, have you ever actually SEEN a circumcision before?

I'm really really glad I'm intact. This comes largely from being European, where circumcision is rare and generally confined to Judaism or serious medical problems.<br>  <br>  There is a slight health reason for circumcision, and that is that it *might* lower the incidence of urinary tract infections during infancy. Nasty as they sound, though, with treatment they are fairly benign, and I think its overkill to amputate a part of your own child to minimise a possibility of a mild inconvenience.<br>  <br>  At TN_Babe0: You would like to amputate a part of your children to make life slightly more easy for you?!

WuhIoS1laa	Not all admin assistants are female. But male admins are in the minority, probably for psychological reasons related to how our genders deal with crap. There is also a day for bosses, though. <br>  <br>  Having worked as an admin, I can tell you it's often a thankless job. You get paid far too little for everything you do. No one tips admins, but sometimes you spend your days coordinating meetings and caterers and cleaning up afterwards like a waitress wearing a suit and heels. <br>  <br>  You deal with the unforgiving usually.  Lawyers always seemed the worst.  For some reason I was given every left handed exec in the office and I had to decipher their notes into English. This was the day when computers were first showing up in offices, and it was beneath the execs to use one. <br>  <br>  You are a juggler of tasks, often conflicting. Often what they ask of you is not what they mean. Their clients will do the same to you at times. You smile anyway. <br>  <br>  You make his travel arrangements and do battle with the hotel and airlines if something goes wrong. You do battle with service personnel, copiers, delivery people, caterers and generally are there to make your boss' life easier.

rThIVk2maa	Eh... yeah it's a bit rude, even if true. You could follow up with "Thank you for attending to this."|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	My guess is she perceived your second request as pushy. It is only 4 days into the new month, and my guess is she does things in a certain order. I agree it was a harsh reply, but she may have been equally offended by your "before you forget" remark.|`|f6qmRicQaa	I don't think it was rude.  She was letting you know that your request was the second on her list of things to do.  I don't know why you would take offense to that.|`|WuhIoS1laa	I don't think the accountant was being rude, but you both could have worded your e-mails better.  I would not have said anything about her forgetting in the e-mail, just sent another e-mail to the tune of:<br>  <br>  "Just wanted to add that I need the reports by [time]. Not sure what else is on your plate, but let me know if this is still possible."<br>  <br>  That way you acknowledge that she does do other things, and isn't just blowing you off and that some of them may have tighter deadlines. And it still serves as a reminder without implying she has already forgotten. <br>  <br>  But then when receiving your request, even if she didn't have time to do it just then, a quick note back to you that she was tied up and your reports were next on her list and would be there by an estimated time.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she has other tasks that come from other people that may take priority and she has to schedule her 2 days there accordingly. <br>  <br>  If this is a consistent problem where you don't get the reports in time to do billing, then a quick chat with whoever is her supervisor might make the prioritizing smoother. That way her supervisor is aware that she has another important request that might need to get bumped up so billing happens on time.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	More than likely she has a lot on her plate this time of the year.  You are pretty lucky that an accountant that is only there two days a week has your copies as a second priority.  <br>  <br>  Going forward, if you are in a rush, help both of you out.  Set up for the accountant to pull the files you need, and you take them and copy them.  Copies are time consuming.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	I think that is her way of telling you that she is doing something for someone higher up than you are, and that you haven't been forgotten, but that you are going to have to wait because one of the bigger bosses has put something on her plate.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	You'll never know unless she tells you what the first priority is.  My guess is she was on the crapper.<br>  <br>  She could've been far more rude, I wouldn't take it personally.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Well if she is noly there 2 days a week...she is somewhere else the rest of the time...she probably thought you were irritating emailing her again...you had asked her once...she's a pro. so no need to ask again.|`|xnsU60hhaa	It was not rude of the accountant, in fact, it was rather nice of her to let you know you were next on her list of priorities.

FmazIF6Maa	Hello... I am a Wiccan, have been for about 18 years now, since I was in my early 20s. My husband is Pagan and we're raising our children Pagan, though my oldest daughter is also Wiccan. <br>  <br>  Don't worry so much about other people saying you'll "grow out of it." Truth is, I don't know if I won't "grow out of it" some day. Not that I have any plans as I am very devoted to my faith right now... but like Robert Frost says, "way leads on to way." Sometimes we get all we can out of one path and we are led to another. So don't let it bug you, just wink and smile and say, "well, maybe, but not today."<br>  <br>  I think it's great to admit that you know nothing about some things and want to learn. A lot of kids your age (and adults, not to mention it) like to think they know everything... so right there you're wiser than most people I know. Just always be open to what you can learn, and the lessons this path will teach you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UxooffHZaa	I am an Eclectic Neopagan. I was a Wiccan in 2001 when I first found paganism. I now follow my own path, though I do often hang out with the local druids for public rituals. (I usually get to 2 or 3 a year, of their 8)|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	If you don't know whether you're a Wiccan, then I can promise you, you aren't.  ON the other hand, in the rather more vague and ill defined sense, you might well be a Pagan.  Wicca is a specific religion, while in one sense, at least, Pagan is a far broader term and encompasses (among other things) an earth centered spirituality.  <br>  <br>  Just FYI, my children were all raised in a Wiccan household, but none of them were permitted to initiate as junior members of the coven until they were 13, and had spent at least a year in a rigorous course of study.  <br>  <br>  Bright blessings!|`|e0e3e97ecc5ec23822071f8a88c516b3aa	You are supposed to be in school. Let me give you a little hint, first you research and learn history, than when you can understand where all these beliefs came from, you can write a comment..

Find out why we tie the Bunny with Easter.|`|pqveENjUaa	Neo-shamanism for the past 5 years. Fun, isn't it?

Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence! <br>  <br>  2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams! <br>  <br>  3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit! <br>  <br>  4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates! <br>  <br>  5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek! <br>  <br>  6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires! <br>  <br>  7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all! <br>  <br>  8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification! <br>  <br>  9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years! <br>  <br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong the is a huge difference between a satanist and devil-worship. Devil-worshippers are idiots that don't have a clue about anything and just think it's cool!! When it's time their have a HELL OF TIME LMAO!!!|`|ckwpC3y1aa	No.
l6Jew1qAaa	I also believe in God...but I think many of the churches today focus too much on money. When the pastors live in million dollar mansions and have expensive cars and designer clothes and sell stuff out of their church to make a profit, and neglect to take care of the poor in their community, then they are nothing but hypocrites and I do not have anything to do with them. I don't attend church for this reason. If I have it to give, I give to those less fortunate that myself. I don't go to church and give 10% of my income to someone who is obviously better off than I am. These people give Christianity a bad name, and you don't see other religions doing this...profiting from the spiritual needs of their congregations. Some churches even teach that if you are not prosperous you must be living "wrong" because if you are living "right" God will "prosper" you. Funny, I thought He said it was easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven. I believe the church community has been deceived and led astray by this "prosperity" teaching among others, and by church leaders teaching against what is taught in the Bible. Sure, the people congregate in one place for one cause, but if it is not the right cause, then it is pointless. If they are gathering so the pastor can work them into a frenzy so they will willingly part with their cash, then that is making a mockery of what church is supposed to be about. In the New Testament, Jesus became angry with the people who were selling in the Synagogue, proclaiming they have turned His Father's house into a den of thieves. Kinda might make you think He does not approve of this type of thing...Just my 2 cents|`|dLq6IoqSaa	I don't believe in god but i don't have problem with most of his believers. But i am totally against the churches they say give to us give to charity but we're gonna hang onto the millions of dollars we have. Look at the vatican, the pope has an estimated 40 billion dollars worth or painting, 50 million dollar toilets that are gold encrusted with diamonds, that is wrong and extremely hypocritical. One of my biggest problems with church is how they interact with children. They say if you don't believe in jesus your going to hell. Then they say to pray for your health, i understand the concept doesn't mean to harm anyone but there are 7 year olds with cancer who believe they aren't getting better because they're wicked in jesus's eyes, they're not praying right or jesus doesn't love them.|`|G82qybLQaa	Firstly was kind of profit are they making and if they are making is it again used for the Ministry purpose or for their own?<br>  If some is making a T-Shirt for lets say $4 and selling it for $7 and giving the profit to church i dont see any thing wrong in that kind of things.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|OyEEyIpdaa	I'm christian and believe my religion provides good family structure examples, but other than that, the church is some bullshit!|`|obbgm4kFaa	According to the Bible writers Jesus is mad against the wrong churches and he WILL KILL ALL THE CHILDREN IN THEM just to make a point!<br>  <br>  According to the Bible writers, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! The Bible writers made it into a clear pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence outside of the Bible that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitler’s holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) When Jesus comes back he will personally slaughter ALL the CHILDREN of the wrong Church brand! He will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed believing that Jesus doesn’t do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam matches Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new religious “sins” like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the new President Obama honors most Christian and Catholic clergy dogmas damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) “I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD”* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they can’t beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children on his own to announce his expected return and at the same time to teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political “PRO-LIFE” stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus’ REVELATION…!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk!) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>  <br>  I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise when they find out that their children have been mysteriously slaughtered! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies! <br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to “dash the infants against the rocks” after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all! <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story… most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.<br>  <br>  I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT that is strongly believed in Christianity today!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. “Turning the other cheek” is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6)… The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in God’s Law “Be fruitful and multiply,” but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus’ gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the “Kingdom Sake.” See Wikipedia “castration”. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS!

If we ask forgivenss for something we are going to go ahead and do anyway, this is not truly being sorry for an act of sin we are committing, when we have sinned we ask for forgivness, by truly being sorry, we cannot just ask forgiveness if we do not mean it, God knows our heart, and if you are going to kill yourself how can you truly mean it to say forgive me, when you are going to do it anyway.|`|LjsRfaskaa	I'm not a Christian.

If humans are so complex that we need a creator, that we couldn't have been an accident, and this supposed creator is definitely much more complex and intelligent than we are, well why doesn't god need a creator?  Your logic is flawed.  Look at it this way:<br>  <br>  1.  Humans-very complex-must need creator<br>  2. god-even more complex-needs no creator<br>  <br>  therefore your argument that something as complex as we are needing a creator falls apart.  Logic would dictate that if you believe that we as complex beings need a creator due solely to the fact that we are complex, you would also have to believe that this creator would in turn also need a creator due to his increased complexity.|`|mmWuh8swaa	Well, i don't think things like that. I don't boast myself or say im intelligent or whatever. I just think that i am smart as how smart i can be or good looking or whatever. Im not atheist, but you could say i am, cause i don't have religious beliefs nor do I care if there is a God or Not. Is there one? There isn't one? I dont care. btw, what I am exactly?..Well, i never asked myself stuff like these and add the topic about God or anything. Sure, i have thought of these, but i won't suddenly include God. Also, your question is kinda random honestly. The question sounds like, for example, "Wow, the food tastes so good. Its juicy, tender and flavorful. How can that be so tasty? Thank Bill Gates (random much?) for Microsoft!" . So yeah. I'll be lol-ing. But as far as i'm concerned. I understand that you have a religion. Understanding the beauty of the Lord of what he has created and all but, atheist is not so different as you might think. And no, atheist don't ask themselves such a random question. but i'll give you a fact. They will ask themselves and figure out stuff logically rather than spiritually. Hope this makes you know more about the outside of religion.|`|6218aa4ce97adc01667ecdc71f086d9daa	You know, God is so intelligent, good looking and well, gosh darn it, He rocks!

And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the Dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the Dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison:<br>  <br>  For example: among man's arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are entirely different. Sometimes they are equal, sometimes the material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that five dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which it is composed is not worth five cents. And so, if such a work of art is taken to the antiques market and related to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million dollars. Whereas if it is taken to the scrap dealers, the only price received will be for the five cent's worth of iron.Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to manifest all his Names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaningful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, he causes others to read them. That is to say, the Dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, "I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His mercy and munificence." That is, belief, which consists of being connected to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man's value is in accordance with that Dominical art, and by virtue of being a mirror to the Eternally Besought One. In this respect insignificant man becomes God's addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise superior to all other creatures.However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the relation, enter man's being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into darkness and cannot be read. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts and elevated inscriptions will be hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen with the eye, will be attributed to lowly causes, Nature, and chance, and will fall utterly from value. While each is a brilliant diamond, each becomes a piece of dull glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physical being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of animals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into coal.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  SECOND POINT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&t=First+Chapter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&...</a>|`|bwpU9G2Taa	The way I see it, if God isn't the reason for life...then what is?<br>  <br>  I suggest you read this book of the Bible.<br>  It questions things in life.<br>  <br>  If it weren't for God, I believe I wouldn't be here.<br>  <br>  Have an open mind.<br>  Learn from experiences.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	Here is an excerpt from a book....Long but worth the read. Best read with your bible. Brought me peace of mind......<br>  <br>  Very likely you are interested in getting answers to life’s big questions. No doubt you sometimes wonder: ‘What is the purpose of life? Is this life all there is? What is God really like?’ It is good to ask such questions, and it is important that you do not give up until you find satisfying, reliable answers. The famous teacher Jesus Christ said: “Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.”—Matthew 7:7.<br>  5 If you “keep on seeking” for answers to the important questions, you will find that the search can be very rewarding. (Proverbs 2:1-5) Despite what other people may have told you, there are answers, and you can find them—in the Bible. The answers are not too hard to understand. Better yet, they bring hope and joy. And they can help you to live a satisfying life right now. To begin, let us consider a question that has troubled many people.<br>  IS GOD UNCARING AND HARDHEARTED?<br>  6 Many people think that the answer to that question is yes. ‘If God cared,’ they reason, ‘would not the world be a very different place?’ We look around and see a world full of war, hatred, and misery. And as individuals, we get sick, we suffer, we lose loved ones in death. Thus, many say, ‘If God cared about us and our problems, would he not prevent such things from happening?’<br>  7 Worse yet, religious teachers sometimes lead people to think that God is hardhearted. How so? When tragedy strikes, they say that it is God’s will. In effect, such teachers blame God for the bad things that happen. Is that the truth about God? What does the Bible really teach? James 1:13 answers: “When under trial, let no one say: ‘I am being tried by God.’ For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone.” So God is never the source of the wickedness you see in the world around you. (Job 34:10-12) Granted, he does allow bad things to happen. But there is a big difference between allowing something to happen and causing it.<br>  8 For example, think about a wise and loving father with a grown son who is still living at home with his parents. When the son becomes rebellious and decides to leave home, his father does not stop him. The son pursues a bad way of life and gets into trouble. Is the father the cause of his son’s problems? No. (Luke 15:11-13) Similarly, God has not stopped humans when they have chosen to pursue a bad course, but he is not the cause of the problems that have resulted. Surely, then, it would be unfair to blame God for all the troubles of mankind.<br>  9 God has good reasons for allowing mankind to follow a bad course. As our wise and powerful Creator, he does not have to explain his reasons to us. Out of love, however, God does this. You will learn more about these reasons in Chapter?11. But rest assured that God is not responsible for the problems we face. On the contrary, he gives us the only hope for a solution!—Isaiah 33:2.<br>  10 Furthermore, God is holy. (Isaiah 6:3) This means that he is pure and clean. There is no trace of badness in him. So we can trust him completely. That is more than we can say for humans, who sometimes become corrupt. Even the most honest human in authority often does not have the power to undo the damage that bad people do. But God is all-powerful. He can and will undo all the effects that wickedness has had on mankind. When God acts, he will do so in a way that will end evil forever!—Psalm 37:9-11.<br>  HOW DOES GOD FEEL ABOUT INJUSTICES WE FACE?<br>  11 In the meantime, how does God feel about what is going on in the world and in your life? Well, the Bible teaches that God is “a lover of justice.” (Psalm 37:28) So he cares deeply about what is right and what is wrong. He hates all kinds of injustice. The Bible says that God “felt hurt at his heart” when badness filled the world in times past. (Genesis 6:5,?6) God has not changed. (Malachi 3:6) He still hates to see the suffering that is taking place worldwide. And God hates to see people suffer. “He cares for you,” the Bible says.—1?Peter 5:7.<br>  12 How can we be sure that God hates to see suffering? Here is further proof. The Bible teaches that man was made in the image of God. (Genesis 1:26) We thus have good qualities because God has good qualities. For example, does it bother you to see innocent people suffer? If you care about such injustices, be assured that God feels even more strongly about them.<br>  13 One of the best things about humans is our ability to love. That also reflects God. The Bible teaches that “God is love.” (1?John 4:8) We love because God loves. Would love move you to end the suffering and the injustice you see in the world? If you had the power to do that, would you do it? Of course you would! You can be just as sure that God will end suffering and injustice.

In the interview by Paul Bradshaw with Rick Warren, Rick said: "People ask me, 'What is the purpose of life?' And I respond: 'In a nutshell, life is preparation for eternity. We were made to last forever, and God wants us to be with Him in Heaven.'<br>  <br>  One day my heart is going to stop, and that will be the end of my body--but not the end of me. I may live to 100 years on earth, but I am going to spend trillions of years in eternity. This is the warm-up act, the dress rehearsal. God wants us to practice on earth what we will do forever in eternity. We were made by God and for God, and until you figure that out, life isn't going to make sense.<br>  <br>  Life is a series of problems: Either you are in one now, you're just coming out of one, or you're getting ready to go into another one. The reason for this is that God is more interested in your character than your comfort. God is more interested in making your life holy than He is in making your life happy. We can be reasonably happy here on earth, but that's not the goal of life. The goal is to grow in character, in Christ likeness. This past year has been the greatest year of my life but also the toughest, with my wife, Kay, getting cancer. <br>  <br>  I used to think that life was hills and valleys - you go through a dark time, then you go to the mountaintop, back and forth. I don't believe that anymore. Rather than life being hills and valleys, I believe that it's kind of like two rails on a railroad track, and at all times you have something good and something bad in your life. No matter how good things are in your life, there is always something bad that needs to be worked on. And no matter how bad things are in your life, there is always something good you can thank God for. You can focus on your purposes, or you can focus on your problems. If you focus on your problems, you're going into self-centeredness, 'which is my problem, my issues, my pain.' <br>  <br>  But one of the easiest ways to get rid of pain is to get your focus off yourself and onto God and others. We discovered quickly that in spite of the prayers of hundreds of thousands of people, God was not going to heal Kay or make it easy for her. It has been very difficult for her, and yet God has strengthened her character, given her a ministry of helping other people, given her a testimony, drawn her closer to Him and to people. You have to learn to deal with both the good and the bad of life. Actually, sometimes learning to deal with the good is harder. For instance, this past year, all of a sudden, when the book sold 15 million copies, it made me instantly very wealthy.<br>  It also brought a lot of notoriety that I had never had to deal with before. I don't think God gives you money or notoriety for your own ego or for you to live a life of ease. So I began to ask God what He wanted me to do with this money, notoriety and influence. He gave me two different passages that helped me decide what to do, II Corinthians 9 and Psalm 72. <br>  <br>  First, in spite of all the money coming in, we would not change our lifestyle one bit. We made no major purchases. Second, about midway through last year, I stopped taking a salary from the church. Third, we set up foundations to fund an initiative we call 'The Peace Plan' to plant churches, equip leaders, assist the poor, care for the sick, and educate the next generation. Fourth, I added up all that the church had paid me in the 24 years since I started the church, and I gave it all back. It was liberating to be able to serve God for free. We need to ask ourselves: Am I going to live for possessions? Popularity? Am I going to be driven by pressures? Guilt? Bitterness? Materialism? Or am I going to be driven by God's purposes (for my life)? <br>  <br>  When I get up in the morning, I sit on the side of my bed and say, 'God, if I don't get anything else done today, I want to know You more and love You better.' God didn't put me on earth just to fulfill a to-do list. He's more interested in what I am than what I do. That's why we're called human beings, not human doings. <br>  <br>  Happy moments, PRAISE GOD. Difficult moments, SEEK GOD. Quiet moments, WORSHIP GOD. Painful moments, TRUST GOD. Every moment, THANK GOD. "<br>  <br>  Take care and may God bless you spiritually. ? ? ? ?|`|vmv1rP76aa	Personally, I believe before life we choose our trials and tests and what we will experience for God. As we come down into life, of course we forget such things, and our choices are our free will, but our tests remain those chosen by us. <br>  <br>  For instance, some people need to learn tolerance, or patience, or deal with dysfunction. A lot of its a test to evolve your soul. I can't personally believe we all just have one life in one identity and that's it. To me, its more of a constant cycle of growth and evolvement. <br>  <br>  Just my personal thoughts here. = )|`|kDnN2AoNaa	you set meaning in your life dont hear other saying that is the Lord...the Lord did not create man...man created the God to all of you religion fanatics who think that our purpose is to live by the god...the point is that you live to set your rules in your life|`|IS7Xubkfaa	The point of living is to serve people as best as we can and are able.

That is the benefit of religion with all its rules, rituals, and traditions. They are expressions of who this mysterious God revealed itself to be to mankind. All aspects of a religion makes distinctions from other religions so there will be no confusion of what is being revealed to and expressed by a people. For example, although pagan religions just like Christian religions believe in a Supreme Being, Christianity clarifies for pagans who that Supreme Being is. Hence St. Paul preaching at the pagan altar dedicated to the "Unkown God." St. Paul teaches them that they are a faithful people and see that they are religious as well, he took the opportunity to clarify what they are truly doing and who they are truly worshipping; The One God who sent His only Son; Jesus. And so, Christianity clarifies and corrects other religions, but does not crush other religions. The pagans still worshipped and remained a religious people, but are more clear in mind, interaction, and expression in what they do due to Christianity and the religious practices and traditions it holds. <br>         This monotheism must be made distinct from common pagan polytheistic practices and traditions. For example, the pagan religions had a feminine priesthood. The Jewish and Christian people distinguished themselves by having only a masculine priesthood. That way no one can say, "Oh. Those Christians....well they're just like those in Mithra, or Hindi, or Buddah." Without distinct religious practices, rituals, and traditions then one religion would be just like any other, but the conflict would be worse because the beliefs would still be so different and confusing. "Are you this or that in your belief? How can we know without seeing how you practice your religion?"<br>                Maybe an analogy may be helpful as to why . Suppose one has the belief and personal experience of stopping. How can that person express such a belief and experience without some tradition, law, and symbol to teach it with? And so, we have physical stop signs, the law that teaches when it is appropriate to stop (commonly at intersections), and the tradition of when this is pacticed everyday. In an analogous way we see the necessity of religion. <br>               Granted there are still conflicts of belief with the various religions and traditions out there, but at least it does provide a kind of border. No Catholic can say what they believe of God and claim they are Hindu and vice versa. A distinction is made between them through their individual religious rites and traditions. And their individual religious rites and traditions provide clear expression of who the God or gods they worship is or are.     <br>               I wish I could say more and be more clear, yet I have to end this and resume teaching my class. The students are coming in as we speak. May the Lord bless and keep you. May the light of His face shine upon you.<br>  <br>                             God's and your beast of burden<br>                                             Fr. john|`|j5YwuVEIaa	We need to consider what Jesus taught regarding whether we need a religion or not right? He was 'sent as a model for us to follow closely'.<br>  Consider the following:<br>  <br>  How to Find the Right Path<br>  Francis Bacon, a 17th-century English philosopher, essayist, jurist, and statesman, advised searchers for truth “to weigh and consider.” And an early U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, said: “Reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error. .?.?. They are the natural enemies of error.” So if we are genuinely searching for truth, we will “weigh and consider” and pursue “reason and free inquiry.”<br>  Identifying why such an approach is vital, British scientist Sir Hermann Bondi noted: “Since at most one faith can be true, it follows that human beings are extremely liable to believe firmly and honestly in something untrue in the field of revealed religion. One would have expected this obvious fact to lead to some humility, to some thought that however deep one’s faith, one may conceivably be mistaken.”<br>  How can a person, therefore, determine if he is indeed on the ‘cramped road leading off into life’? Jesus taught that God must be worshiped ‘with truth.’ So reason dictates that if two teachings are opposed to each other, both cannot be true. For example, either humans have a soul that survives death or they do not. Either God is going to intervene in human affairs or he is not. Either God is a Trinity or he is not. Truth seekers want factual answers to such important questions. Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that God has given us the answers in his Word, the Bible.<br>  Since “all Scripture is inspired of God,” the main way to test various teachings is to measure them against the Bible. (2?Timothy 3:16) In so doing, you “prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” (Romans 12:2) Can you ‘prove to yourself’ that your beliefs are rooted in the Bible? Being able to do so is important because God does not want you to be misled along with “the entire inhabited earth.”—Revelation 12:9.<br>  Are Teachers Necessary?<br>  Jesus did not hand his disciples a few scrolls and say: “The answers to your questions are all in there. Go home and find them for yourselves.” Rather, he patiently and kindly taught them God’s word. In turn, those who accepted his teachings adopted his methods when they taught still others. Take the example of the disciple Philip. He spoke to an honesthearted Ethiopian official who had earlier become acquainted with the Scriptures from his contact with the Jews. But the man needed help. So Philip—a representative of the Christian congregation—was directed to help him. Had this official been unwilling to discuss religion, he would not have learned about Jesus’ role in God’s purpose. What a fine example this Ethiopian is to all who are searching for the truth!—Acts 8:26-39.

A feeling of complete contentment-it's quite magical. When you have to try to find something to be troubled about.

Protestants who can't see that don't know catholicism.  Just about everything I see on here thrown against catholics clearly comes out of ignorance.  OK they rely on church tradition as WELL as the bible, but consider the history - it is the original church (along with orthodox, from whom they split in 1054) and there wasn't a bible when it started.  That was assembled by the church itself rather later on.

As usual, she was praying to the Lord explaining her situation and thanking Him for what He was gonna do. As usual, the atheist heard her praying and thought to himself, "Humph! I'll fix her."<br>  <br>  He went to the grocery store, bought a whole bunch of groceries, took them to her house, dropped them off on the front porch, rang the door bell and then hid in the bushes to see what she would do. When she opened the door and saw the groceries, she began to praise the Lord with all her heart, jumping, singing and shouting everywhere! The atheist then jumped out of the bushes and told her, "You ol' crazy lady, God didn't buy you those groceries, I bought those groceries!" At hearing this, she broke out and started running down the street, shouting and praising the Lord.<br>  <br>  When he finally caught her, he asked what her problem was.

FOzN3xwzaa	The Rapture is BEFORE the mark of the beast. <br>  <br>  People will become believers after the Rapture, and they will need to refuse the mark of the beast, and they will be beheaded for refusing, but they will be immediately in heaven upon their deaths  :)|`|RhDPB70Baa	Rapture first, then in the aftermath the Beast will create a new roman empire and instate the Mark.<br>  <br>  As for real-world analogies, the closest thing would be the impending nuclear war in the Middle East (America is annoying the Muslims, Iran hates Israel, Iran and the US have nukes) along with the increasingly cash-less economy that will apex in an RFID (radio frequency identification, think electronic bar code) assigned to everyone that would act as a debit card, drivers license, and portable file cabinet.|`|Ll29odpHaa	The "Rapture" happens when Christ returns and not before. It is after the tribulation. If you are being taught that the saved are raptured to heaven before Jesus second coming.  That is false doctrine and you need to go study the Bible for yourself because that is not what the Bible says.  The word rapture never appears in the Bible (FYI ) God Bless|`|OncdpDunaa	Read Matthew 24. This will explain everything you need to know about the Second Coming and the mark of the beast.

God Bless|`|HbCWNCQzaa	I AGREE WITH JOHN 15:20|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	The rapture will occur before the revelation of the antichrist to the world. 2 Thessalonians 2:3 tells us that the "man of sin" (the antichrist) can not be revealed until there come a falling away first. Some believe this falling away to be a great reduction in the number of believers or something like that, but it is referring to the rapture. The Mark of the Beast is given to people in Revelation 13:16. There are some who do not take the mark, but not very many.<br>  <br>  The rapture is the Second Coming of Christ. Christ will return to the earth, but not actually come down to the earth, He will remain in the sky and we will be caught up (raptured) to meet Him. He will then take us to Heaven where we will go through the Judgment Seat of Christ before finally returning with Christ where He will fight the battle of Armageddon and defeat Satan, cast him into the bottomless pit, and set up His Millenial Kingdom.<br>  <br>  Bride of Christ: the word rapture doesn't appear in the Bible, but neither does the principle of age of accountability. Does that mean that God does not take little children to Heaven when they die before they can grasp the concpet of Christ's sacrifice. No... In 1 Thessalonians 4:17 the phrase "caught up" is translated as harpazo which means caught up by force and rapture means the same thing.|`|yDkSq8rBaa	This is a great question, and a study that goes deeper than what we can discuss here.  For starters, I want to point out that it seems as though a new doctrine has been introduced over the last 60-100 years about a "secret rapture" where people will be "spirited away".  This doctrine does not seem to be based on what the Bible says as a whole about the second-coming of Christ.<br>  <br>  1 Thes 4 is one place in the Bible that shows the time line of when we will meet Jesus:<br>  <br>  "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.   For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, the Mark of the Beast comes before the Second-Coming of Christ, when the children of God meet Him face to face.  So that leaves us with the question, what is the Mark of the Beast, and how do I get or avoid it?<br>  <br>  Revelation 13 tells us:<br>  <br>  Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceives those  who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."<br>  <br>  So who is this "second beast"?  Well, Rev 13 tells us that it will compel everyone in the world to false worship, so we know that it will be a religious institution.  Rev 13 tells us that it will be able to kill those who refuse, so we know that this religious institution will be enjoined with civil authority.  We also read that this second beast causes everyone to worship the first beast.  Protestants since Luther have identified the first beast as the Vatican, which is a study in itself, but easy to see from the dozens of identifiers given in the Bible regarding the first beast given in Daniel 7:<br>  <br>  1) Small county (Vatican is smallest)<br>  2) Comes out of Europe (Italy)<br>  3) Changes Times and Laws (Pope changes the commandments regarding idol worship, and changes Sabbath worship to Sunday)<br>  4) Speaks blasphemy (Pope claims to be able to forgive sins)<br>  5) Persecutes the Saints (Thousands were killed by the Catholic church in the dark ages)<br>  6) Rules with power for 1260 years (528AD to 1798AD when Napoleon marched into Rome and imprisoned the Pope)<br>  etc etc<br>  <br>  So the Mark of the Beast is given to those who obey the second beasts command to worship the first beast.  Those who resist and worship God alone, are given the seal of God on their foreheads.  This the important part.  Revelation 14 says: <br>  <br>  "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."<br>  <br>  The test in the end if time will be the Law of God, the 10 commandments, including idol worship and honoring the Sabbath instead of Sunday.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Why does the Bible use beasts as symbols of human rulership? For at least two reasons. First, because of the beastly record of bloodshed that governments have accrued over the centuries. “War is one of the constants of history,” wrote historians Will and Ariel Durant, “and has not diminished with civilization or democracy.” How true that “man has dominated man to his injury”! (Ecclesiastes 8:9) The second reason is that “the dragon [Satan] gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority.” (Revelation 12:9; 13:2) Accordingly, human rulership is a product of the Devil, thus reflecting his beastly, dragonlike disposition.—John 8:44; Ephesians 6:12.<br>  Some use the hand to vote and elect the ones in office they want others use their minds to support one or the other even though not taking any action.(Psalm 2:1-6) Why have the nations been in tumult And the national groups themselves kept muttering an empty thing? ?2?The kings of earth take their stand And high officials themselves have massed together as one Against Jehovah and against his anointed one, ?3?[Saying:] “Let us tear their bands apart And cast their cords away from us!” ?4?The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will hold them in derision. ?5?At that time he will speak to them in his anger And in his hot displeasure he will disturb them, ?6?[Saying:] “I, even I, have installed my king Upon Zion, my holy mountain.”The word rapture is not used in the Bible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This does not mean,|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	According to Revelation the anti-christ is the one who makes all take the mark of the beast.  In order for the anti-christ to be in power the rapture would have to have taken place already because we will be removed so that he can show himself.  Do not be mistaken.  People will still be getting saved and there will be believers on earth during the tribulation period.|`|aogwoFKJaa	There are three schools of thought:<br>  <br>  Rapture is pre-trib (Before the antichrist arrives on the scene);<br>  <br>  Rapture is mid-trib (Antichrist is on scene for first half of reign, but rapture occurs before his evil side is revealed);<br>  <br>  Rapture is post-trib (We endure it all).<br>  <br>  The way I read it, there will be those left on earth who will realize what has happened (after the Christians are raptured) and turn to Christ. These will be beheaded.|`|LF4vun1maa	Too bad, some questions don't have answers.

And then they use those results to suggest that the majority of US citizens are for it.
FnCvyXVDaa	I have a problem with the term "homophobia" as well. Are people really afraid of homosexuals? No.  Most people are just called bigots if they don't like homosexuals. Some religious people will never change because they consider it an abomination against God and that is their right to believe so.  The fact is that some people do choose to be gay or bisexual as is evidenced in some young women calling themselves "straight lesbians".|`|AA10578359	You are presuming that a homosexual has the choice to be that.<br>  <br>  It's as genetic in most cases, as the color of skin, or the gender at birth.<br>  <br>  If homosexuality is a genetic issue then to hate someone for how they were born does cross over from race to sex to homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Your presumption is based on one side of the story, and not on the entirety of facts that can be obtained through research.|`|ye33tNkOaa	first off, let's clarify that homosexuality is an act, an activity or a behavior, not a race or gender. homosexuals are able to hide or mask their actions, hence we have "closeted individual". people who engage in these acts have a choice to do so. <br>  <br>  women and people of color have NO choice in the matter. yes there are ways to hide a person's race or gender, but it usually involves alot  more work than it would to hide one's sexuality.

God loves everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.  Yes, God created gay folks.  People who have a tendency to be attracted to the same sex won't necessarily go to Hell.  It's the part of acting on it (sexually) that makes the homosexual lifestyle sinful.<br>  <br>  Anyone can be Christian and "gay" (meaning that he/she abstains from sexual relations with the same sex).<br>  <br>  Again, God loves sinners but hates their sin.|`|vLRrmVXMaa	1.)

They seem to hold that homosexual men can choose not to be who they are, and that god only specifically hates homosexual sex, so if two men want to be with each other that's fine as long as they don't perform an act otherwise considered normal and sometimes necessary in a couple. Because of course sex is about waaaay more than pleasure and reproduction, it's a sacrament that is holy only between a man and a woman.

coming from Ur would have had a Creation Story already !!<br>  [ Later on you will use this as evidence against the Jewish Creation Story but we can leave that hypocrisy aside ]<br>  <br>  There was a Church before, during, and after the Bible. You have this picture of a 'Bible' falling out of the Mesopotamian sky and landing in some Egyptian or Canaanite Borders, but it ain't so Neuron-Deficit Guy.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	I've seen plenty of papers by linguists showing pretty conclusively Moses didn't write the Pentateuch, and some fairly convincing papers by anthropologists suggesting the Moses of the Bible never existed.|`|aHEwm3QLaa	Precisely. Like Bigfoot, religion is most likely a scam since it has no evidence|`|L6E6lDGKaa	< If the creation events were so important why didn't God leave that up to Abraham? ><br>  <br>  Who said the creation story was all that important to the people of those times? They basically lived it. There never was a question about the existence of God or the origin of man. That was obvious to them and is one of the reasons most cultures had some form of godly belief. Even today recent written history is challenged by revisionists. <br>  <br>  The five books are more important to us today because the story is repeatedly challenged, unsuccessfully I might add.<br>  <br>  You are spitting in the wind. You cannot win this argument because you are against your Creator and he will never allow small people such as yourself, to distract his plan. You can believe what you want but you can never change factual history. You can only deceive yourself.

gDVQNMR7aa	Oops, they did it again. More evidence that the Catholic Church is NOT the church Christ founded.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	We already know of the hypocrisy of the Churches.  Before adding this to the list we must ask if this is a lot to pay for the area?  In some places in the US, this would barely pay for a fixer-upper.  While in others it would be  a mansion.<br>  <br>  So while upper management in the Catholic clergy has never worried about being thrifty and abused everything in sight, a Little care and research must be used before condemning this.  Otherwise it could be used to show detractors like us here do not do proper homework.|`|NWopkX4baa	It wouldn't surprise me if they did. I thought the Catholic Church was one of the richest institutions in the world. They still have a lot of gold from the past. Not to mention all their downtown properties.|`|UxooffHZaa	Doesn't look like they're hurting for cash.|`|4VouLn4waa	Its a cover up. The Catholic church is obscenly wealthy but they would never let the public know that because then they wouldnt feel obligated to give their weekly tithing. Think about it, tithing is giveing 10% of your weekly income to the church. Lets take a church with 100 regular members and they each make $75,000 a year. That comes out to $750,000 at the end of the year. Thats more than enough to pay for electric bills. And that is a relatively small church compared to most and their are people that give much more money|`|vYAgIMLdaa	The Catholic church is one of the richest organizations in the world. They didn't get that way by giving money back to the parishioners.|`|uOwgkwTLaa	Even some of the Most Highest level leaders tend to be corrupt and greedy.

It is also apparent that the value of the home is well above the median price for a home in Cincinnati. It appears as well that some parishioners have objected. It seems clear however that the home has not been given to the archbishop and is considered an asset of the archdiocese. The funds used to purchase the home have been freely given by parishioners, even though they may have been unaware of how those resources were to be spent. Why would parishioner expect to receive kickbacks from profits attained through properly acquired shrewd investments? They are freely given charitable donations not "for profit" investments of parishioners. One may be inclined to assert the funds may have been used differently, but it does not appear they have been intentionally misused. All this being said however is the church, the archbishop, or the diocese of Cincinnati immune from making poor monetary decisions, and does this in anyway affect whether the church remains the pillar and foundation of the truth? It makes about as much sense as condemning Christianity because Christians are sinners<br>  <br>  EDIT; "Is THIS an example of prudence !!" No it's an example of Charity.    AGAIN: Even if the "hypocritical" excesses of the purchase came from willfull intent...Do you condemn Christianity because Christians are sinners?|`|rIvp1BToaa	the catholic church  is  not short of  funds  but are always  begging for more  they have the  money  put away  when they want it.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	As much as I love new material to wave in the faces of the hypocritical church, I'm going to have to ask for references to this claim.|`|HIskrREJaa	figures

Look it up.<br>  <br>  Edit: The concept of a Trinity did not start until the 2nd or 3rd century. It did not take full shape until the late fourth century. Hypothetically speaking. If you traveled back in time to when the Book of Acts took place and questioned any of Jesus' apostles about a Trinity they would have looked at you like you were crazy. <br>  <br>  Trinitarians will never use historical facts to back up their beliefs, but quite frankly, the Trinity doctrine was not taught by any Christian before the 2nd century AD. None of the original apostles taught it. Because it didn't exist.

Whom are you looking for?” She, imagining it was the gardener, said to him: “Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” 16?Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Upon turning around, she said to him, in Hebrew: “Rab?bo′ni!” (which means “Teacher!”)<br>  <br>  <br>  To show the prejudice the men did not believe what the women told them.But Jesus had a great love and respect for women and he was the personification of his Father.We need to stick to Gods word and not mans,who has been infiltrated with all types of lies and prejudice ,they have twisted the scriptures to their own advantage.

These are two different words.  Men and women are equal in dignity but men cannot bear children and women cannot be priests because priests infuse life into the Church whereas women receive that life, nurture it and bring it to birth -- but they cannot give life. Obviously women have the far greater role in this aspect, by the way.  No matter how successful she may be as CEO (or whatever) of some Fortune 500 company, nothing has or ever will have as much value as her ability to bring forth another "image and likeness" of God.  True, women can do more than give birth -- but none has a higher value.   <br>  <br>  For example, I spend equal amounts of money on both of my parents for Christmas and their birthday (which by the way, is the same day) but the gifts that I give are not the same.  My dad would look utterly ridiculous if I gave him the same skirt I gave to my mom and my mom would disown me if I gave her an electric hedge trimmer.

I can give you a brief account of their origin though.<br>  <br>  Playing cards arrived in Europe in the early 14th century via Islamic trade and probably had their origins in Chinese money games.

Yet, he could not understand what Jesus meant by the statement: “Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”—John 3:1-3,?10.<br>  “How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?”—John 3:4.<br>  Millions of people today profess to be “born again” and claim to understand clearly what this means. Others, like Nicodemus, are puzzled with the whole concept of being born again. Since Jesus Christ made the point that this was a prerequisite for entering the Kingdom of God, it is vital that we do understand what he meant by being “born again.”<br>  In response to Nicodemus’ question, Jesus further said: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit. Do not marvel because I told you, You people must be born again.”—John 3:5-7.<br>  Difficult to grasp? Jesus knew that understanding spiritual truths is not easy. So in order to make things clearer, he used an illustration about the wind. “The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone that has been born from the spirit.” (John 3:8) Nicodemus could hear, feel, and see the effects of the wind, but he could not understand its source or its final destination. Yet, the reality of the wind was beyond question. Similarly, those who lack spiritual insight would find it difficult to grasp how Jehovah, by means of his spirit, could cause a person to be born again and what the ultimate destiny of such a one would be. However, with the help of inspired Bible writers, we can comprehend such matters.—John 16:13.<br>  Clearing Up the Puzzle<br>  What did Jesus have in mind when he spoke about being “born from water and spirit”? Birth means beginning. A new birth means a new beginning. In the case of Jesus’ disciples, their first step toward being born again began once they repented of their sins, turned away from a wrong course, and were baptized in water. Starting at Pentecost 33?C.E., in response to such action, Jehovah gave them what Peter referred to as “a new birth to a living hope .?.?. reserved in the heavens.” (1?Peter 1:3,?4; 3:21) Jehovah’s holy spirit implanted in them a conviction that they would eventually live with Jesus Christ in heaven. This gave them a whole new outlook on life—a new beginning.<br>  Was this simply an emotional religious experience? No. God’s holy spirit made them into something entirely new, “a new creation.” (2?Corinthians 5:17) When they were first born as humans, they were sinful children of Adam, inheriting all the imperfection that he passed on to his descendants. Now, upon being “born again,” these disciples obtained a clean standing before God. How? The merits of Jesus’ sacrifice were applied in their behalf. Thereby, God viewed them as righteous even while they were still imperfect humans. (Romans 3:25,?26; 5:12-21; 1?Corinthians 6:11) More than that, Jehovah now recognized them as his sons. The apostle Paul shows how: “For all who are led by God’s spirit, these are God’s sons .?.?. God’s children.” (Romans 8:14,?16) They were now accepted as part of God’s heavenly family.<br>  And there was more. Paul explains again: “If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ.” (Romans 8:17) These spiritual sons of God now had the prospect of inheriting what Christ Jesus was going to inherit—kingly power in heaven. Jesus revealed to the apostle John the number of persons who would be corulers with him over the earth—144,000. (Revelation 7:4; 14:1-3) Then he went on to show John that these favored disciples “will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years.”—Revelation 20:6.<br>  Benefits to Others<br>  Does this mean then that in order to gain God’s favor, everyone must be “born again”? Not at all. Jesus’ sacrifice covers more than the 144,000 persons who have been specially chosen to be with him in the heavens. When the apostle John wrote to “born again” Christians toward the end of the first century, he said regarding the sacrifice of Jesus: “He is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.” (1?John 2:2) How is this so?<br>  In this way. Those who are “born again” will rule with Jesus Christ in Jehovah’s heavenly Kingdom to bring benefits to others of mankind who will live on earth. This was foretold in a remarkable promise made to Jesus’ forefather Abraham almost 4,000 years ago. “By means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves,” Jehovah told Ab|`|l6Jew1qAaa	How many times were you born physically?

Just how wicked is this???<br>  The Bible teaches us that Jesus our unblemished Lamb of God came to atone for this sins of this world 'once and for all' according to the sacrificial system as set by God in the OT. He achieved this with His water baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan River and His shed blood on the Cross (1 John 5:6-11). So, He blotted out all the sins of the world once and for all like this!!!   He could never have been crucified if He never at first took our sins up. And all our sins were laid upon Him in this Jordan River (Matthew 3:15).<br>  <br>  We are thus born again once when we come this way, and believe in this full and complete atonement for sins (the gospel truth of the water and the Spirit). Once you believe in this original and authentic gospel just as it is, then you are washed clean from all your sins, and are given a pure white garment of the forgiveness of sins. Then you really don't wish to soil it again.<br>  <br>  All churches that leave out one part of Jesus' atonement and believe in the other part, constatly mock God, insult Him and make Him out to be a liar!!!

Then they all sat down together to have a meal.  Who knows if this actually took place or if it is just a fun story that turned into a national holiday and a delicious meal.

jcK6EXpiaa	I have observed this as well. In native american communities, paedophelia was unheard of pre-contact. Thats probably because (in my tribe anyways) those who sexually offended a woman would be buried alive and have their heads exposed to the elements until they died. I imagine if paedophelia ever happened, the punishment would have been worse. Kids werent even hit or yelled at (many families still keep these beliefs, I however have adopted spanking). But after the boarding schools, when native kids were sent like little cattle to these internment camps where 98% of them were sexually molested (google it, its true) paedophelia and child abuse/neglect has been an issue in some families. In my husbnads culture (a country where a lot of african americans' ancestors came from) molesting a kid gets you the death penalty, yet in many african american families, this is a common issue (thanks to the slave era, when people had to let their kids be sex slaves) or in Cambodia, the majority of customers looking for under age or toddler prostitutes are white men. I don't know why. I do know, however, that it is VERY VERY rare that a person grows up to be a paedophile without having been molested themselves as children. Perhaps paedophelia became a social dysfunction back in the Roman era, when Military generals began using boys as sex tools while away? Even the greeks used to make fun of the romans for this, calling them "boy lovers" in a derogatory way. I wonder if this cycle just perpeduated itself over the generations in Europe, and has been spread like wild fire within the last couple thousand years? Because it isn't like its a natural thing, animals arent paedophiles, so it isn't a biological thing, its totally psycological.<br>  <br>  Edit: Dee, where do you think this dysfunction originated from in African american communities? It isn't a problem in a lot of African countries. Like I said, its a learned behavior, not a natural dysfunction.|`|W2pgME36aa	Let me tell you something, I'm a black female and I grew up in tough neighborhoods. Most of the black women there have been molested and raped by black men. Young black women wouldn't tell their mothers because they are afraid of what the mother might say or if the molester is with the mom. Plus some of the black mothers and daughters relationship IN THOSE SITUATIONS really don't have a good one. These rapes and molestations are unnoticed. I believe with all my heart R.Kelly messed around with those girls. I saw this all the time growing up. When I was eleven men in their twenty would ask me out although I stated that I was a MUCH younger age. I developed early and men "in the hood" didn't give a damn. I still hate being a woman. What did you think "S.E.X." was about? Stop those nasty stereotypes.<br>  <br>  <br>       This isn't to say that all black men are bad and all white men are good: but if black women start opening their mouths, you will see more black men in jail for these crimes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  additional info:   And do you think that these young black girls are speaking any more? Hell no. You know the "black" motto, right? Don't snitch.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	You know white people will have offensive, yet true<br>  facts about themselves deleted, whilst leaving up<br>  demeaning questions like "Are blacks jealous of our GOOD hair?".<br>  <br>  Hypocrites.

I can only assume that most of the reported crimes committed by blacks are gang/theft/drug related because many (not all) black criminals come from poverty stricken inner city backgrounds. For many (not all) whites, gang related activity is uncommon, and most don't live in the projects, so perhaps their crimes tend to be of a less obvious type. The answer above mine is probably the best. Many women and children are legitimately afraid to speak out, and too often black girls are seen as sex objects. Plus, blacks are statistically viewed as less trustworthy, so there's always the worry that no one will believe their story.

bVQO0BsPaa	Well to be honest, would you admit to following someone around?!<br>  I know I wouldn't, but maybe that's just me.<br>  This sounds like quite a cute little love story to be honest.<br>  If i were you, I'd just go for it. Ask her, before she gets a chance to ask you :)<br>  Or wait, if you want. Let her do the asking. But from the sounds of it, she either doesn't know you're a lesbian, or doesn't think you fancy her, in which case I'd either tell her, or just jump straight in!<br>  I hope you guys work out really well.<br>  <br>  EDITTTTTTT:<br>  <br>  Yeah, lol. Also, I don't think SHE would admit to following you around, so it made her story better if SHE was the one being chased and wanted?|`|kJUCZFwkaa	Συγν?μη δεν νομ?ζω ?τι μπορο?με.|`|4KNESOnlaa	yes you two should get together and scissor.....good luck...|`|uvo24D2gaa	lol obviously shes shy why dont you ask her out|`|Ja7M7JKhaa	i smell a conection :)|`|1TT9oiO0aa	I think she likes you. <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like she's too scared to tell you how she feels and too shy. Also the way she was talking about you in the canteen was as though she was probably hoping it would get back to you so you could talk to her about it and create more conversation? I don't know. But it sounds to me like she's into you but probably worried about what her friends will think. <br>  <br>  A|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	I think you should ask her out.

"White" is the mixture of ALL colors!|`|vmv1rP76aa	Maybe, depends on where you live and where you come from. I can believe those in the middle east and meditteranean, as well as islanders have mixed race ancestry somewhere in there. <br>  <br>  Even in the southern US, about 30% of whites have some black ancestery and nearly all black-Americans (who descend from slavery) have some form of native american or white down the line. That's where you get "light-skinned" blacks from.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	no i'm 100 moroccan/berber and that's what I am and no one from my family ever  mixed with anyone outside of my race which is berber|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	no, some people stay within their cultural,ethnic, and national lineage.|`|HVc8kBcvaa	If you're religious, we all came from 2 people.

AA12006309	First, I'm not interested.  You're far too young and I'm far too taken.<br>  <br>  Second, to all the people who are all "omg don't find a relationship online!!!", you'd be surprised how many relationships start off that way.  My last relationship lasted over eight years, and we had met in an online chat room.  He relocated so we could live together after the first year.  My current relationship also started online, and Baron and I now live with each other.<br>  <br>  The internet, if you are cautious, is a great place to meet people, though I'd typically recommend it for older users, and not teenagers.  There's a very real fear of stalkers and older people too willing to take advantage of younger users.<br>  <br>  If it's possible to meet people offline, by all means, do it.  If you feel the only way to meet people is online, then do so CAUTIOUSLY.  The world is a dangerous place these days.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	For most sane rational people on the internet...all 3 of them would tell you not to do this.  Wait it out, mature a bit and all will be well.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Sorry I have someone.|`|af3618c3c438b0c88538a888bf12f6b8aa	You sound very lonely, but I agree with above, that you never should seek a relationship online.<br>  <br>  It's very easy for people to misrepresent themselves through the internet, leading to all sorts of dangerous situations.<br>  <br>  Also, it's very easy to find love when you are NOT looking for it.  At 16, your likes and dislikes are still growing and changing.  Use this time to learn. Learn from your school lessons, your classmates, find a sport you like, a hobby, work out at gym, volunteer at hospitals, animal veterinarians, tutor younger students.<br>  <br>  In short, open yourself up to a variety in your life.  The time will pass, and you will be more mature and more of a person to like and love.<br>  Good luck to you!|`|9MRSjkkxaa	taken. sorry dear.|`|ZHtrPHcvaa	To be honest, I'm 18...so sorry...BUT I would be glad to be your friend :)|`|A1Dawc5paa	I'm 17 and I'm bisexual. I don't know you but I'm going to give you a piece of advice honey. <br>  <br>  --dont ask if people want a relationship just like that. Try to get to know someone first (one at the time). <br>  <br>  It sounds like you live in a very small city because I live in a big city and there's so many bi girls noone even cares anymore. You are young, you can always patintly wait for the right girl/guy to come along. That's what I do (:|`|bqkdHDuVaa	Hey, Dude I agree. I don't think you would want to do that Online... the community online isn't safe now a days!(never has been) Focus on school ^.^ you got your whole life ahead of you To decide Especially, If you go to college....

You'll have so many guys and girls Hitting you up in college it wouldn't even be funny ^.^ lol|`|Y5aN1Xvmaa	An online relationship is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  You can't see each other or anything and what would happen if someone in person showed interest?|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Im takenn :)<br>  And I love my boyfriend dearly :)|`|cVewVL0Taa	Don't try to find a relationship online- bad things can happen...just wait and see if you meet anyone new who would be interested. Why rush?|`|SMHnpVraaa	Don't try and find someone online, and your pretty young anyways.  It's not that safe.
LykjWv6faa	I couldn't agree with you more. The majority of people that are overweight never really blame themselves for what they do. They blame society, genetics, etc. But, in the end, who is the one putting food in your mouth? Society? No, you are. If people feel so horrible that they are overweight, quit whining and do something about it--eat healthy and exercise.|`|XI7gT2Njaa	I agree with you they're just lazy and want to somebody to blame for they're weight|`|hVVALFAPaa	Ouch.<br>  <br>  Another instance of grouping everyone and making a common mass  assumption. <br>  <br>  I am fat because I love chocolate and don't really like exercise.  It is my choice to be this way. The only blame that I put on 'the wolrd' is that if they had not discovered cacoa, then I would not have chocolate to love.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	because it is an easy way to steal out of one's own responsibility.<br>  <br>  actually the "in" thing to do is to call all many misbehaviours illnesses.<br>   take "eating disorders" - they all are misbehaviours and not<br>  illnesses.<br>  <br>  i find it disgusting.|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	You literally spelled just about every other word wrong.<br>  <br>  Sigh ...<br>  Another public school casualty ..<br>  <br>  I'll take your rant more seriously when you learn how to spell basic words like 'fault' and 'world' and 'society'.|`|iMeh9lMbaa	by fat people do u mean rich people?|`|v1JBAwSTaa	Yea some fat people, tried to sue McDonalds for them being so fat they won the case due to the fact that McDonalds didn't have Nutrition Facts, now if you look at the burger wrappers it has nutrition facts lolz|`|2Aif1J03aa	send the fat people to africa to be hunted as food, two birds with one stone|`|88bDvyiwaa	they keep shoving down twinkies down their throats, keep dying of heart attacks and that costs us taxpayers a lot of money.<br>  <br>  get into shape dammit.
XxWovDNCaa	You're starting to think on your own. Good for you.<br>  God is impossible. Period.<br>  If you want to live by the example set down in the bible, then do so (though cursing innocent fig trees should be low on your list) most of us don't need a book of fables to tell us right from wrong...|`|F7YzHVyUaa	This is where "faith" comes into play.  You don't have any faith.<br>  <br>  George Michael would tell you that you "got to have faith-a faith-a faith-a, baby."|`|Ne9rXERpaa	No -- it's completely understandable, given the complete lack of evidence supporting the God Hypothesis.|`|FxVRPIm3aa	No. Considering the overwhelming lack of evidence for any god, I don't see how most manage belief.|`|zFTR0EwGaa	Philosophically it is reasonable one way or the other.  There are plenty of good arguments for the existence of God.  Since all these arguments move from very general facts to the source of these facts (i. e. God), it fits firmly within reason for one to believe.  Are they compelling enough to sway the hardened agnostic or atheist?  Most likely not.  But neither are the arguments against God compelling enough to sway a philosophically balanced theist.  So again, it is reasonable one way or the other.  You are not violating some kind of mental irrationality law by either believing or not.<br>  <br>  A few good arguments for God are summarized here by philosopher Peter Kreeft:<br>  <a href="http://peterkreeft.com/topics/gods-existence.htm" rel="nofollow">http://peterkreeft.com/topics/gods-exist...</a><br>  <br>  A good article as to why constructs such as the ‘Flying Spaghetti Monster’ and such are poor philosophical devices are because  “people like Ryan, Russell, Dawkins, and Dennett who compare God to a celestial teapot betray by so doing a failure to understand, and engage, the very sense of the theist's assertions. To sum up. (i) God is not a gratuitous posit in that there are many detailed arguments for the existence of God; (ii) God is not ruled out by anything we know; (iii) God is not a being who simply exists alongside other beings. God is quite unlike a celestial teapot, a lunar uncorn, an invisible hippopotamus, and suchlike concoctions.” From this article: <a href="http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2008/11/russells-teapot-does-it-hold-water.html" rel="nofollow">http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/m...</a><br>  <br>  These brainiacs go at it regularly here on the reasonable and philosophical support/non-support for God almost daily:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/atheism-and-theism/" rel="nofollow">http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/m...</a>|`|OC8NWQkyaa	Reason is foundational: the answerer 1-2-3 is right.  Plato and Aristotle followed it by the light of natural reason.  You can study Jesus and come to understand Him as well.  I believe Jesus will lead you.  Pray for faith.  It is a gift, so you must have it given to you by God.  I've heard it said the appropriate prayer for a non-believer is something like "God, if you are there, help me believe".   He cannot refuse you if you ask sincerely.  That is because he loves everyone individually as if no one else existed and he wants you to know and love him.|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	No. It is understandable to think the ideas of a great philosopher in history are good and that the mythos created by the Romans hundreds of years after his death are nothing more than fairy tales|`|vSlOpJoRaa	Nothing wrong with it.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	"the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason." -- There's REASON <br>  <br>  Matthew 22<br>   <br>  22:36  Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>   <br>  22:37  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>   <br>  22:38  This is the first and great commandment.<br>                                                   -- There's JESUS<br>  <br>  <br>  Sooooooo....

Here's the dates each were written:<br>  <br>  The list of books to be included in the Old Testament was finalized around 100 BCE.<br>  <br>  Genesis - Compilation written, by various contributers, during the period covering 900 BCE - 400 BCE; drawing on an oral tradition that may date back to 1100 BCE, or earlier.<br>  <br>  Exodus - Around 550 BCE.<br>  <br>  Leviticus - During the 400's BCE; but an earlier version likely existed in the 600's.<br>  <br>  Numbers - During the 500's BCE.<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy - During the 600's BCE.<br>  <br>  Joshua - Original source material from the mid 900's BCE; rewritten in the 600's BCE, and again around 500 BCE. <br>  <br>  Judges - Most written between 500 BCE - 600 BCE; chapters 17 - 21 were added some time between 500 and 200 BCE, while chapter 5 may date back to the 10th century BCE.<br>  <br>  Ruth - Written sometime during the period 400 BCE - 250 BCE; likely based on an older folktale.<br>  <br>  1 Samuel / 2 Samuel - Originally one book. Compiled of material written during two, or possibly three, periods: the oldest from 961 BCE - 922 BCE, most recent from 750 BCE - 650 BCE, and a possible third source from the period in between.<br>  <br>  1 Kings / 2 Kings - Originally one book. Compiled from the work of two unknown authors, one from around 609 BCE, the other from 550 BCE. The writers drew from earlier works of the Bible, and other Hebrew text.<br>  <br>  1 Chronicles / 2 Chronicles / Ezra / Nehemiah - Originally one book written by an unknown author in 300 BCE.<br>  <br>  Esther - Standard version from the 100's BCE; Greek additions in the Catholic version added just prior to the Common Era. <br>  <br>  Job - Folktale written between 500 BCE and 250 BCE; with chapters 32 to 37 added more recently.<br>  <br>  Psalms - A diverse collection spanning a period from as early as 1300 BCE, to 500 BCE.<br>  <br>  Proverbs - A collection of short moral sayings compiled by a number of authors in the 5th or 4th century BCE.

Chapters 1-4 are by the same unknown author; with Chapter 5 likely by a second person.<br>  <br>  Ezekiel - Much of the work was by Ezekiel 597 - 571 BCE, with the last part of the book compiled after his death.<br>  <br>  Daniel - Anonymous author from around 150 BCE.<br>  <br>  Hosea - Much of the work is likely written by Hosea in the 8th century BCE, with later additions by Jewish editors.<br>  <br>  Joel - From 537 - 500 BCE.<br>  <br>  Amos - Most written by Amos in the 700's BCE, with chapter 9, verses 9 - 15 added considerably later.<br>  <br>  Obadiah - Written in the post-exile period. There is some debate as to whether it is a compilation, or the work of Obadiah alone.<br>  <br>  Jonah - Post-exile parable, by an unknown author.<br>  <br>  Micah - Parts written by Micah, prior to 721 BCE; other parts written by unknown authors during, and after the exile. Most of the first 3 chapters were added relatively recently.<br>  <br>  Nahum - 663 BCE - 612 BCE.<br>  <br>  Habakkuk - Chapters 1 and 2 from 597 BCE, chapter 3 by a later unknown author.<br>  <br>  Zephaniah - Most written between 640 and 609 BCE. Chapter 3, verses 14 - 20 added considerably later.<br>  <br>  Haggai - 520 BCE.

K45xwCxoaa	the philosophical theory of knowledge|`|HfgGJIWJaa	the study of crust developing on the outer titanium layer of the earths atmosphere.|`|usIma0vIaa	Epistemology (from Greek ?πιστ?μη - episteme-, "knowledge, science" + λ?γο?, "logos") or theory of knowledge is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope (limitations) of knowledge.[1] It addresses the questions:<br>  <br>  What is knowledge? <br>  How is knowledge acquired? <br>  What do people know? <br>  How do we know what we know? <br>  Much of the debate in this field has focused on analyzing the nature of knowledge and how it relates to similar notions such as truth, belief, and justification. It also deals with the means of production of knowledge, as well as skepticism about different knowledge claims.<br>  <br>  The term was introduced into English by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier (1808–1864).[2]<br>  <br>   <br>  Is knowledge a subset of that which is both true and believed? (See below)Contents [show]<br>   <br>  [edit] Knowledge<br>  <br>  [edit] Distinguishing knowing that from knowing how<br>  In this article, and in epistemology in general, the kind of knowledge usually discussed is propositional knowledge, also known as "knowledge-that" as opposed to "knowledge-how." For example: in mathematics, it is known that 2 + 2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to add two numbers. Many (but not all) philosophers therefore think there is an important distinction between "knowing that" and "knowing how", with epistemology primarily interested in the former. This distinction is recognized linguistically in many languages, though not in modern Standard English (N.B. some languages related to English still do retain these verbs, as in Scots: "wit" and "ken").[3]<br>  <br>  In Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi articulates a case for the epistemological relevance of both forms of knowledge; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a bicycle, he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the physics involved in maintaining a state of balance cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. It is worth pointing out that in recent times, some epistemologists (see Sosa, Greco, Kvanvig, Taylor, Zagzebski) have argued that we should not think of knowledge this way. Epistemology should evaluate people's properties (i.e., intellectual virtues) instead of propositions' properties. This is, in short, because higher forms of cognitive success (i.e., understanding) involve non veritic features that can't be evaluated from a justified true belief view of knowledge.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Belief<br>  Main article: Belief<br>  Often, statements of "belief" mean that the speaker predicts something that will prove to be useful or successful in some sense—perhaps the speaker might "believe in" his or her favorite football team. This is not the kind of belief usually addressed within epistemology. The kind that is dealt with is when "to believe something" simply means any cognitive content held as true. For example, to believe that the sky is blue is to think that the proposition "The sky is blue" is true.<br>  <br>  Knowledge entails belief so the statement, "I know the sky is blue, but I don't believe it", is self-contradictory (see Moore's paradox). On the other hand, knowledge about a belief does not entail an endorsement of its truth. For example, "I know about astrology, but I don't believe in it" is perfectly acceptable. It is also possible that someone believes in astrology but knows virtually nothing about it.<br>  <br>  Belief is a subjective personal basis for individual behavior, while truth is an objective state independent of the individual. On occasion, knowledge and belief can conflict producing "cognitive dissonance".<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Truth<br>  Main article: Truth<br>  See also: Criteria of truth<br>  Whether someone's belief is true has no effect on whether it is actually believed. On the other hand, if something is actually known, then it cannot also be false. For example, a person believes that a particular bridge is safe enough to support them, and attempts to cross it; unfortunately, the bridge collapses under their weight. It could be said that they believed that the bridge was safe, but that this belief was mistaken. It would not be accurate to say that they knew that the bridge was safe, because plainly it was not. By contrast, if the bridge actually supported their weight then they might be justified in subsequently holding that he knew the bridge had been safe enough for his passage, at least at that particular time. For something to count as knowledge, it must actually be true.<br>  <br>  The Aristotelian definition of truth states:<br>  <br>  "To say of something which is that it is not, or to say of something which is not that it is, is false. However, to say of something which is that it is, or of something which is not that it is not, is true."<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Justification<br>  <br>  [edit] Plato<br>  Main article: Theaetetus (dialogue)<br>  In Plato's dialogue Theaetetus, Socrates considers a number of theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief that has been "given a

Mosaic Law ordered that anyone who resided with the Jews and kept God's Laws were to be treated as one of God's People, no matter where they came from.

As long as they were faithful to God, nothing could harm them.  All their efforts were rewarded.  As soon as they fell away from God, a 10 year old with a sling shot could beat them.<br>  <br>  By the time of Jesus on earth, the Jews had rejected God so much that he was fed up with them.  Killing his Messiah, his Son, was the last straw.  The opening chapters of Acts shows at Pentecost in 33CE, God poured out his holy spirit on those followers of Christ in that upper room.  Anointing them as his new Chosen People.  Later called Christians.

aPuUuWlLaa	Atheism has been around since the earliest recorded history. In ancient   Greece there were philosophers writing about their skepticism of gods. In the 6th century BCE there were sects of Hinduism that didn't have beliefs in a deity. The term atheist we use now was not coined until the middle ages though. The word agnostic not until later. Both concepts were around though of course long before the invention of the words we now use for them.<br>  <br>  For me the best thing about being an atheist is that it is the intellectually honest position for me. The worst is the way some people have a hard time with someone who doesn't share their beliefs and sometimes their desire to impose those beliefs.<br>  <br>  I think morality stems from reciprocal ethics, empathy, education, and our evolution as social beings that live and survive best in groups. No supernatural basis is necessary. I do have some different ideas about what is moral from some theists but that does not mean I am not moral or have a basis for morality. Even groups of theists disagree on issues here.<br>  <br>  I think my own becoming an atheist after being raised Christian is not the same as others and different atheists arrive at that via different means. For myself I think education, studying my own religion and others, and majoring in biology I think all played an important role. I think though other people could study these things and still be theists. The difference I think really comes down more to individual psychology and how deeply beliefs were ingrained in childhood.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	When and where did Atheism begin?  <br>  <br>  That's a good question; it never occurred to me that there was a beginning.  There have been atheists throughout history,  but is "Atheism" some kind of modern movement?  Did it have a beginning?  I don't know, but now I'll look into it a little.<br>  <br>  What are some positive and negative experiences you've had being Atheist?<br>  <br>  I have a lot of negative experiences; it's a Christian country (US) that I live in.  My first wife was upset by my atheism.  Some of my friends and family worry about me because I don't share their beliefs.  I try to be respectful of others' beliefs so long as they don't try and force them on me; as a result I often find myself bowing my head for prayers and such.  I do it to respect my friends and family, not to respect any imaginary god.  I am very disturbed these days by some of the superstitious balderdash being put forward by some Christians relating to Creationism, the Prosperity Movement, and gay and women's rights.<br>  <br>  Since... morals on?<br>  <br>  I don't think people base their morals on religion; that's a misconception, in my honest opinion.  I think we all learn our morality from our parents, who learned their morality from their parents, and so on.  When we get older we look for things to reinforce our belief system; this might be religion, it might be philosophy, or it might just be our own, internalized version of these moral beliefs.<br>  <br>  Would you say...?<br>  <br>  I think most atheists in the US probably went through the same process I did.  During their youth they had a weak faith; then, as they reached their teens they began to question what they really believed.  They might have tried different denominations; read up on beliefs, and did some real "soul searching"; in the end they decided they didn't believe in God.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Atheism is lack of belief in deities. Nothing else. It isn't a belief.<br>  <br>  Atheist is from the Greek, "atheos",  without god. So that is where the term originated. When and where did atheism begin? Everyone is born an atheist.<br>  <br>  I haven't had any "experiences" as an atheist; what are some of the positive and negative experiences of not believing in unicorns? See, it's a silly question.<br>  <br>  Atheists get their morality from the same place every human being does: the social contract and our evolutionary heritage. The fact that most religions teach that morality is inseparable from God doesn't change anything.<br>  <br>  You become an atheist when you realize you don't believe in any god. That's it. No ceremony, no creed. How do you become a non-Muslim, or a non-Communist? You just are. Atheists feel the way about all gods that believers feel about all gods that aren't their own.|`|WalnRzfGaa	atheism began when religion began, its the default position to a theist.<br>  <br>  i feel more free and have no worries about how i live my life being an Atheist. some negative experiences are i get told im going to hell, and have beliefs of others put into my government that should not be there. i cant even run for political office in my state.<br>  that's a common misconception. if people based their morals off the bible then they would stone people for working on sunday, not wear mix cloth, have sex with siblings and many many other terrible things. people get their morals from not wanting that sort of thing to happen to them.<br>  Atheism is simply the belief there is no God or Gods. it can happen suddenly or it can be realized over a long period. for me i was not raised in a religious family therefor never had a need to believe a God was looking out fo rme.|`|O7SshRl6aa	An Atheist is simply a person who does not believe in a god or gods.<br>  <br>  I can only come up with one negatives about being an Atheist - hatred from the community at large (Atheists are the least trusted group in America).  In some states Atheists are not allowed to hold public, elected offices.<br>  <br>  My morals are based on natural morals.  Believe me, in your heart you know what's right and wrong:  it's wrong to kill, it's wrong to steal, it's wrong to be destructive.  It's a good thing to help people, give to charity, share with people, be kind and good to people, etc.  While there will always be psychopath here and there, 99.99% of people KNOW instinctively what's right and wrong.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are as many paths to Atheism as there are Atheists.  For me, people around me had belief, so I tried tobelieve too.  I read the bible, the quoran, and some eastern teachings,and even took some religious studies classes.  Nothing struck me as the least bit moving or true.  The more I read and studied, the less I COULD believe.  I did not reject religion without making a solid attempt to understand it.|`|ucuP0boCaa	When and where did Atheism begin? I HAVE NO IDEA. I KNOW THAT MANY ATHEIST ARE IN THE CLOSET.

Freedom to follow knowledge wherever it leads without having to block information that doesn't support my religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  We base our morals on feelings of empathy for our fellow humans and the social contract.  Humans discovered long ago that if they didn't agree on some basic rules for living together the tribe didn't survive.<br>  <br>  For me, I studied for many years trying to convince myself that there really was a benevolent deity watching over the world.  I finally had to conclude that there wasn't one.  For others it's more of a flash of understanding.|`|NrzxtivLaa	everyone is born an atheist, religion is a learned subject, morals do not arise from religion, although religion CAN influence morals, all it takes is a simple lack of belief in a supreme being, and everyone that "becomes" atheist does so in their own way|`|Z9jtdw17aa	When and where did Atheism begin? -- As others have said, "atheism" is the concept that there is no proof of a divine being.  It did not begin at any specific time or any specific place any more than the belief that Bigfoot and a magical Unicorn do not exist started in one place or at one time.  Some people believe in God.  Some believe Bigfoot is real.  Some even believe there is a magical Unicorn.  An atheist is unlikely to believe in anything without substantial proof.<br>  <br>  What are some positive and negative experiences you've had being Atheist? --  It is "atheist" with a small letter, not a proper noun.  The most positive experience has been taking responsibility for myself rather than pushing my well-being and self-worth off to some distant "heaven."  The most negative experience I have is in facing the misunderstanding of those around me.  My religious relatives love me, but I am not confrontational about some of the nonsense that they accept.  It's hard to see them put so much effort into things that don't help much, except to provide them mental comfort.<br>  <br>  Since most people base their morals on religion, what do Atheists base their morals on?  -- Most people do not base their morals on religion.  IF that were true, the most obviously religious people would be the most notably moral, which is clearly counter to observations.  Moral people base their morality on a system of belief in what is right and good.  I can believe in things that are right and good without believing that the source of those right and good things is somehow beyond the natural world, and must be supernatural.  <br>  <br>  Would you say there is a certain way to become an Atheist? Another words does it take a while to become one, or does it happen more suddenly?  --  Others keep saying we are born atheist.  I'm not sure I agree.  I think we are born agnostic.  Then we are taught to think about the world in terms of a religious foundation or in terms of verifiable fact.  Some of us come to skepticism about supernatural beings  later in life because we have been around people who accepted the teachings of a church unquestioningly.  We had to learn to continue to question past the point where our families stopped questioning.  It would be different for each of us.  I personally had some bad experiences with individuals who claimed "religious revelations."  It made me question what the source of knowing anything was.  It took a while.<br>  <br>  In my experience, most atheists know a lot more about religions than religious people know about atheists.|`|RedEGIfZaa	Weak atheism is simply the lack of belief in gods.  It is as old as the first sentient creatures on Earth, probably six hundred million years.  Or older, since there are likely sentient beings elsewhere in the universe.  All people are born atheist, and all humans started out atheist.  It was religion that has to be invented.<br>  <br>  Positive experiences... most of them.  Being free from belief in the supernatural offers unending reward.  Negative experiences... I honestly can't recall any.  Being reviled would count in most people's books, but anyone who would revile atheism is not a person I impart any importance to.<br>  <br>  My personal morality is based on the concept of social liberalism.  That is to say, anyone should be able to live their life however they choose, so long as they do not harm or violate the rights of nonconsenting others.<br>  <br>  To become an atheist?  All you need to do is demand proof for claims before you believe them.  One simple gesture, and religion no longer has a leg to stand on.|`|a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	I'm an agnostic.  I think fear is the main negative factor that tends to drives me away from both atheism and religious belief.<br>  <br>  If you're a total atheist and you don't hitch your life to some higher purpose, but live only for your own self-fulfillment, I think you can be terrified that you're not living "right," not pursuing your fulfillment in the right way, and so you become terrified of wasting your life and then dying unfulfilled.  <br>  <br>  I know that this terrified me when I was about 30.  There are atheist answers to that kind of fear, and I favor those by the existentialist writers JP Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir as I understand them.   But certainly my personal experience of feeling isolated, mortal and without a guide to behavior was one that I found very disagreeable when I was 30.<br>  <br>  Positive experiences:  Personally, I find the Christian notion of death, judgment and heaven or hell in the Afterlife to be enormously oppressive and fear-inducing.  When I was trying to be a better Christian, and partly believing the scriptures, I was often very, very anxious about not believing the "right" theology, or not having "enough" faith, and therefore running the risk of hellfire and damnation.<br>  <br>  I also found it horrifying and frightening to think that my somewhat skeptical parents, whom I loved, were also supposedly heading for damnation because they didn't believe just the right things about Jesus.<br>  <br>  One GREAT thing about atheism and/or agnosticism is not believing in personal damnation in that way, and not having to agonize over whether my late mother, who I think was a pretty good woman, is being tortured in flames in Hades for having been too skeptical.<br>  <br>  Other things that have attracted me to atheism, or at least away from evangelical Christianity as I understood it:<br>  <br>  (1) To me, it's possible to accept religious ideas as very HUMAN constructs, as a very human way of grappling with and trying to resolve some very human dilemmas.  That suggests that I can find some merit and some truth in many different religions, if not all of them.  <br>  <br>  It means I don't have to choose one particular version of Protestant Christianity as being "right" and all other faiths -- from Roman Catholicism to Islam to Hinduism to Budhhism to Jainism to Zoroastrianism to Judaism to atheism -- as being "wrong.<br>  <br>  To the extent I do believe in God, I think it would be much fairer of God to spread religious truth around in that way, as opposed to giving one small tribe of people, the Jews of the pre-Christian era, a supposed monopoly on it.  That means as an agnostic, as an atheist, or possibly as a Quaker, I can look for good things in all the different religious faiths.  <br>  <br>  I think that makes much more intuitive sense than the notion that Jews and/or Christians have the "truth" while everyone else is mistaken.<br>  <br>  (2) Atheists and agnostics don't need to worry as much as religious people about theodicy -- about the problem of evil in the world.<br>  <br>  If I were still trying hard to call myself a Christian, would I need to justify the Nazi Holocaust as somehow expressing "God's will"? <br>  <br>  Would I need to see God's will or God's plan in the brutal Spanish conquest of the Americas in the 1500s?  Would I need to see God's justice is the grotesque poverty now afflicting about 1 billion people in the Third World?<br>  <br>  Would it be psychologically important for me to find God's will or God's love in outbreaks of plagues and cholera, or in the early deaths of children, or in the current meltdown of the US economy?<br>  <br>  I don't know.  But as an agnostic, I don't worry about this whole question anymore.  I don't blame God|`|015c4be64c1987ae727eabb9ce9cc03baa	Prior to there being any idea of 'god' in the world, everyone was atheist, but the term didn't exist so they weren't called that, they simply had no belief in god.<br>  <br>  The term "atheism" was a response to the term "theism" which became a world view when the idea of god was invented.<br>  <br>  Everyone bases their morals on the same thing - societal mores, things that benefit society, behavior that helps everyone survive, but some people say it comes from god, thats all.<br>  <br>  To become atheist simply stop believing in the mythology of god or gods.|`|EcqG1Yanaa	I did not begin, it is just a term used to define a lack of religion.  <br>  It doesn't really affect my life where I live<br>  Society.

Actually, everyone is born that way.<br>  <br>  You know the morals always bugs me.  If your religion instills your morals, and I am assuming you are a Christian, it must instill the same set in everyone of you.

THE END.|`|AA12181796	1) It's not a religion; it didn't begin at any particular time or place. Atheists are not part of a group. It is a term for anyone who does not believe in God. That includes non-theistic religions, people who are spiritual but do not adhere to any set of religious beliefs, and people who completely dismiss any possibility of the supernatural. More likely than not, non-belief in gods came before anything else.<br>  <br>  2) Nothing really happens to me specifically because I am atheist. I've been yelled at by preachers a few times, but they don't know I'm an atheist - they're just ranting at anyone who happens to be passing.<br>  <br>  3) I don't agree that most people base their morals on religion at all, unless you're suggesting that if we proved tomorrow that a certain religious path was incorrect, everyone who followed that religion would become totally amoral. I think everyone has an innate understanding of basic morality that is reinforced by society and our upbringing. It may comply with religion, but as an atheist, I believe religion is man-made in the first place.<br>  <br>  4) I just considered whether it was really likely that there was a deity, and decided the answer was "No." I came around to that view over about two years, probably.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Atheism has always been, as we are born atheists and religion is something which must be taught.<br>  <br>  Positive experiences I have involve no longer being subjected to the whims of a deity, and a huge release of guilt over being a fallible human being.

They also believe that this life is it, when you die it's all over. Creation has no beginning other than what science can explain, which no one can its all just theory and conjecture. Granted some of it makes sense. A whole other topic can be started on that one. Even evolution was officially penned by a Christian (Darwin). No one knows when Atheism began, officially. I've never been Atheistic. Usually they find another non-spiritual system (you can't get away with believing in nothing). The morals vary widely and can not be grouped. There is one sure-fire way, stop believing. This is usually gradual but some people have experiences that are very tragic and they look for comfort from a realm that has trouble reaching this far (their is a barrier or veil that impedes normal movement, that's why the Bang had to be Big(Big Bang)).|`|QCzSbYVLaa	Watch this video - www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ImMtHrrKo <br>  <br>  As to your questions, atheism began with the first man, or being with the power to think.

I4tulYTzaa	I completely agree with you. I think this is the biggest problem with Islam. Maybe not exactly as you have described. But I believe Islam has been corrupted by man. These so called religious scholars have manipulated the Koran. Manipulated it to meet their own needs for power & prestige.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	My friend, ISLAM makes itself look bad...He just tries to make other religions seem worse.<br>  <br>  There's nothing good about the mutilation of the human body...and yet such descriptions are scattered throughout the Quran.<br>  <br>  There's nothing good about polygamy in this day and age...and yet it is specifically stated as perfectly okay for a Muslim man to have four wives and as many slave girls as he wants.<br>  <br>  It gives Muslim men permission to beat their wives.<br>  <br>  It gives Muslims permission to slay disbelievers.

I am personally against comparative religions, but there are times when one needs to draw a line. <br>  Eg: in the western world islam is synonymous with polygamy, what they don't realise is that Islam is not the first religion to allow this. How can you explain this without comparison? Same goes for many other misconceptions.|`|D4xmy588aa	Well he is into comparative religion<br>  <br>  that is what he does, compare religions.<br>  <br>  but i suppose you do have a point.

Although that's the point he tries to make, he does not answer the question. Like you said he was asked WHY Is POLYGAMY ALLOWED IN ISLAM and his answer was that HINDUS ARE MOREPOLYGAMOUS. What he was trying to say was that you shouldn't question Islam, however, he didn't answer why and that poses many questions. I do agree with you that he should stop comparing Islam to other religeons in that way.|`|QIgrBrFdaa	Dr Zakir Naik is a great debater. When debating, i think it's important to look at the issue from every direction, and from the speeches I have seen, i don't think he goes over-board in comparing religions to put Islam ahead. I think he is very good with his debates. Though i do agree that people shouldn't put other religions down to bring their own up, and if alot of people are feeling that he is doing this, then maybe he should consider another approach.<br>  <br>  From the video's i have seen, he hasn't put other religions down at all, he's compared them but not particularly in a negative way.|`|OCg8zOH2aa	he is an amazing speaker and debater.

Father's Day was a logical next invention and has no religious basis. And I doubt St Valentine is too bothered about what goes on on his name day, although the tradition of celebrating true love at least goes back to Chaucer, which is a bit longer than Clinton Cards.|`|U5iot8qfaa	They have become just a money making gimmick but i think they should not be abolished, if you want to buy a nice gift for that person you can if you don't then don't.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	No it is only commercialised if you allow it to be so,my most treasured cards are ones made by my children many years ago.it is only greed that makes things commercialised remove peoples greed and revert back to what those dates actually mean.|`|7Ce2oC9Yaa	No.  For many people they are heartfelt holidays.|`|fBso80Ubaa	Mothers' Day and Fathers' Day should *not* be abolished.  Sure, they may be commercialized, but ultimately, they recognize the people who brought us into this world.  Also, unlike Christmas (another very commercialized holiday), they cut across all faiths and cultures.  They're something anyone can celebrate, because appreciating (or at least acknowledging) one's parents is part of being a person.<br>  <br>  Valentine's Day, on the other hand, is a completely different story.  It should be abolished ASAP.  It's essentially a holiday for women.  It may have made sense in the 19th century when women had fewer rights, but nowadays, it's more of an excuse to get free gifts than an actual holiday.  Come on, I'm sure you've heard of those "buy me diamond jewelry or lose me" ultimatums, whenever V-day is coming up.  Abolishing this holiday will only strengthen relationships and reduce the staggering divorce rate.|`|KKK9caZFaa	No body forces you to spend on those days.  There are no rules about spending money on those days.  As a mother I appreciate a day of recognition, relaxation and a bit of pampering.  i don't expect a gift or even a card.  My husband views fathers day similarly.  As a partner I think a simple 'happy valentines day' suffices, and maybe an excuse to spend a bit more time together, not necessarily out spending money at a restaurant etc, a nice meal together at home with kids in bed early is just as good if not better!|`|DyHpuiR8aa	Valentines - maybe - depends what y'all do<br>  <br>  Mothers' and Fathers' day though, are very old traditions mainly to do with the church (something like the family would go to the mother's church on that day - rather than their regular church which would probably be the father's)<br>  <br>  Although, I don't know the reason behind Fathers' day...  hmm...<br>  <br>  However, on these days we take time to appreciate and repay our parents for all that they've done for us.  We can all celebrate these days without spending much money at all!  In fact, I'm certain that someone I knew once didn't spend a penny and just did the housework all day instead of their mother.  Not that we should all work our socks off for one day a year - but money needn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  As for Valentine's day - look into the origin... Unless I've been raised by lies, there was a bloke called Valentine (surname) who wrote loads of love letters.  I think he died before winning any hearts though... not a clue... As I said, I'm not sure about this.<br>  <br>  Anyway, my point is that none of these celebrations need to have money involved - they have become so commercialised over the years.<br>  (What would a mother rather receive?  Something her children poured their hearts & souls into creating or a mug that says "world's best mum"?)|`|OcUt4BfXaa	No. I like them. Their holidays to show appreciation of family and/or loved ones. And they well deserve it.

No.  Some are hated because of their past mistakes or their leader's mistakes, such as Germany, Japan, Russia, but not as much as America.. not even North Korea is hated that much.  I don't think the rest of the world hates America.  In my opinion, there are more nations that appreciate America than those which hate it.  Those who think good about America are those who are grateful for what America has done for their citizens, such as helping them fight against intruders on their soil, taking them in as refugees into American soil, etc.  Those who hate it are the ones who are either jealous of its powers or they think of it as their enemy because America has protected those very nations they tried to take their lands from.|`|XkUO3pfOaa	Because we wish that our country's where as great as yours!

3GO5k5nNaa	Dear OD, <br>  <br>  I will try and answer this to the best of my knowledge.<br>  <br>  Islam is similar to Judaism in that we believe in One God, and that there is an unseen realm, which includes angels, and also that a succession of Prophets were sent to this earth to convey God message to humanity.<br>  <br>  The Quran, which Muslims  believe to be the word of God, accepts all the Prophets from Adam to Muhammad (May God's peace and blessings be upon them all), however, Judaism (at least orthodox Judaism) doesnt not accept Jesus or Muhammad in any way..<br>  <br>  The Jewish people follow the Torah and the rules in the Talmud.<br>  <br>  The languages in which the text was revealed are both semitic languages. Arabic is very similar to hebrew.<br>  <br>  Certain restrictions are similar..food is prepared in a similar manner - Kosher is simlar to Halal..<br>  <br>  The Quran accepts that scriptures where sent down to people of previous nations, such as the Jewish people, however, it states that these scriptures have not been preserved over time, so have been modified from their original text.<br>  <br>  I hope this is of some use.<br>  <br>  Please let me know if you need me to elaborate in some way..|`|FBrwlhPtaa	Similarity: they are both religions<br>  Differences: they worship 2 different gods:<br>  Judaism - worship God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob<br>  Islam - worship Moon god named Allah|`|DZCFD0p2aa	They both believe in being circumcised and they both don't eat pork.<br>  Different - Jews believe seafood (shellfish) isn't Kosher and Muslims believe everything from the sea is Halal.<br>  <br>  Similarities - they are from the same ancestry and can be proven by DNA. Also, they both like to throw rocks. i.e. David killed Goliath with a rock and today, Palistanians throw rocks are jews.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	God created this world in great harmony, order and intelligent design<br>  Everything in this universe is in submission and surrender to the laws (will of God) with no choice, then God created the Ultimate Creation with free choice Adam.<br>  God created Adam and asked him to submit and surrender his will (actions) to God's will (laws)in order to attain peace and harmony in this word like everything else.<br>  This means Islam; so, the guidance to Humanity was be a Muslim.<br>  <br>  God continuously sent prophets asking them to invite people to submit and surrender their wills to God's guidance (will, law and order) (i.e. be Muslims).<br>  Abraham is the first one who declared sound and clear in his mission be Muslims to God.<br>  Up until Moses there was no Jews and no Christians so what was the religion of God called???<br>  <br>  Moses came with guidance of God and asked people again to surrender and submit their will to God's will (the law, the commandments)<br>  <br>  After many years the name Jews became a title, but you can never call Moses to be a Jew.<br>  <br>  maybe the name Jew can be applied ot Jesus as the name became very popular for a 1000 years now. But Jesus never called for people to be Jews or Christians; but he called them to be sincere follower to God and apply the Law in it is fullest. (i.e. submit and surrender to the Law -- will of God) as they all pray to God make you Kingdom on earth like your Kingdom in heaven) isn't that surrender to the will of God and asking that His will to be on earth, but that can only happen if Humans submit and Surrender to God's will and Commandment (that is nothing but be Muslims to Him).  <br>  <br>  The laws in the Torah brought by Moses are as close as can be to the will of God for the Humans to follow and be guided.<br>  <br>  But the Jews started tightening upon themselves to the point of unbearable limits<br>  <br>  Jesus came to loosen certain stringent laws that are no longer suitable for the ever growing humanity.<br>  <br>  Paul mistook this hint and he downplayed the role of the Law.<br>  <br>  Mohammad came to fix it and declared the Law again once and for all with easing off many things so that the law of God will be suitable and flexible for years to come just like jesus wished for and would have do the same if he had lived longer. <br>  <br>  This is why it is more similar between Judaism and Islam.|`|y1JJhQ0Vaa	I'd suggest you read the Wikipedia articles on both of them.<br>  <br>  In addition, if you need any further information on Judaism, you can e-mail me. For the same on Islam, you can e-mail ysiddiqui1 (his answer is right above mine).|`|QuaVnaOEaa	Both systems believe in one loving infallible God.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Members testify to their beliefs about Jesus Christ and other principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  They are usually short, 5-10 minutes, and encompass their feelings, beliefs and experiences with living and apply faith in Christ in their lives.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Other than the random odd-ball that is in every ward here & there who gives travel logs or is rather fanatical and makes every body hold their breath when they get up to the stand to speak....<br>  <br>  Most people try to express their love of the savior and testimony of the church and how recent trials have strengthened that faith.  Or how they received an answer to prayer, or how they found new wisdom or understanding from the scriptures, how the love of their family or friends has helped them, or how a missionary experience has presented itself and they were able to open their mouth and share their testimony.   Members are encouraged to avoid travel logs and sharing things that really are not about their faith & testimony of Christ so as to keep the spirit in our meetings.  Testimonies should be brief  - maybe no longer than 2-3 minutes in duration if possible.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	First off - it is Fast and Testimony meeting - you'd want to get that correct term in your book.<br>  <br>  Mostly - testimonies are brief sharing one's knowledge of the Gospel and how they have been blessed.  Sometimes a story is shared.  Sometimes people stray off topic - but I have never seen anyone asked to sit down.  10 minutes is a very long testimony - most are around 5 or less (I have never timed them).  These meetings are held the first Sunday of every month (except in April) - the Fast and Testimony meeting will be the final Sunday in March.  Every other week - you will have speakers chosen to speak for 10 minutes or so on a specific topic.<br>  <br>  If I might suggest that you find a local chapel and attend the meeting to get an idea - the sacrament meeting is usually the first meeting and most have a time block that starts at 9 am.  70 minutes is a tiny investment in writing a book as far as research goes - and you can sit at the back and leave at the end of the meeting.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yep, timing is everything - you can check about the timing of Fast and Testimony meeting by calling the chapel in the next few weeks - it is just a few weeks though - and I didn't mention October, since that was a ways off and it sounded like you were more in a hurry to get things done.<br>  <br>  You can also tune into www.lds.org on April 5-6 - those days will be filled with testimoines at the General Conference of the Church - but it is not exactly what you were thinking as far a a strict Fast and Testimony meeting.<br>  <br>  Best of luck in your writing!|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	I can give you some weird stories from my ward in Ut, but they would get removed, I am ex0mormon so inly if you are curious...you can email, me, I guantee they will get removed.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	What people share while sharing their testimony is as varied as the individuals who get up. The only commonality is that the experience they share helped bring them closer to Jesus Christ in some way. Often times they themselves do not understand how it all worked thy just know that it did. <br>  For the length of testimonies, I go to a BYU student ward, which has a higher average of the number people that get up and sharing their testimonies than a traditional ward does, and we are asked by our Bishop to keep our testimonies to about two minutes. In my life in the Church I have rarely heard a testimony that went over five minutes, and the few that have gone over five minutes were all done by people who loved to talk and for what ever reason decided to turn their testimony into a talk.<br>  <br>  Edit: An addition to what  by  Wilma Duckie Deene  said. October is another month that we do not have Fast and Testimony meeting. We do not have Fast and Testimony meeting those months because of General Conference.|`|TzY9vkinaa	They are usually pretty brief if they do tell a story. I've never seen anyone get asked to sit down because they spoke too long. 5-10 minutes is a long story.<br>  <br>  The experience could be anything that strengthened their testimony. Some of the ones i've seen are.<br>  Death of a loved one<br>  Prayer<br>  Scripture study/ Book of Mormon<br>  Birth<br>  illnesses/ healing<br>  Missionary experiences<br>  Experiences at war<br>  Baptism <br>  Temple experiences.<br>  Experiences with Children<br>  Getting married<br>  <br>  I think a good thing for you to do is to go to an LDS church on the first Sunday of the month and see what fast and testimony meeting is like.|`|AA10254101	It is called fast and testimony meeting and it is usually the first Sunday of the month. However in the month of April it might be a week later becasue the first Sunday will be General Conference. I encourage you and others to watch or listen to a little bit of it. We bare our testimony usually it is about the beliefs and it does not matter on a time limit.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Everyone is different, so every testimony is also different.  Some people speak for a VERY long time.  Some say only a few words.  Some just stand there and cry.  It depends on the person. <br>  <br>  Most, though, usually just express their love for God, the Savior, their families and friends, and often the gospel.  They may share some experience that has helped build their faith, or they may not.  Again, it depends on the person.<br>  <br>  And yes, people do sometimes go off-topic.  I once listened to a woman go on for twenty minutes about how her cat had died and she just didn't understand why God would do that to her.  I found out later that her cat had been dead for over two years.  Then again, that same Sunday, I listened to a child expressing such a profound love for his Father in Heaven that nearly everyone was in tears.  Testimony meetings are always interesting, at least!
lPZudPkUaa	Yes, many people pass away near their birthday, an anniversary, or a holiday (especially Christmas / Hanukkah). <br>  <br>  It's usually because they are trying to hang on for one more. Sometimes they can't quite make it, sometimes they succeed and then pass away shortly after. <br>  <br>  Ask any doctor, hospitals are PACKED all through January between "one more Christmas" and new year's insurance money.|`|WcTZ7n8waa	Yes. I think it's so weird. I didn't think anyone else noticed.|`|xh4HjRYUaa	I have noticed that, my mother passed away April 1st, and her birthday was going to be April 5th.  Odd.  Maybe its part of Gods plans.
wwzej6rvaa	No - but this verb is weird :D Genie?en - du genie?t - genie?!<br>  <br>  Better: Kommen (to come). Kommen - du kommst - Komm!<br>  <br>  The Germans normally don't put an 'e' on the end of the imperative....It might be, but that's really rare!|`|5mHF9C8Iaa	That isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  E.g.<br>  <br>  Geniessen-->Geniess or Geniesse<br>  <br>  Fahren-->Fahr or Fahre<br>  <br>  The "e" just sounds better.|`|031f2b5c50a8adb5d60eebe4f92a1a91aa	This is really just a colloquial distinction, not one that need be worried about.  By the book most "du" commands should end in "e" but in spoken language, it often isn't pronounced.  Same as "ich hab" = colloquially the norm, but technically an "e" is assumed at the end.<br>  <br>  Further explanation:<br>  1. The "du" form of the imperative is formed by dropping the final "-en" of the infinitive and adding "-e" to the end of the word. This "-e" ending is usually dropped in spoken German and quite often in written German as well.<br>  <br>  2. The "-e" ending on the "du" imperative is always kept with verbs whose stem end in "-d", "-t", "-ig" and "-m" or "-n" after another consonant.<br>  <br>  3. Verbs whose infinitive ends in "-eln" drop the "-e" of the stem in the "du" imperative but not in the "ihr" and "Sie" forms.

ECB8u72Taa	As many people will tell you, there is no standard American accent.  However, if you are seeking to speak with the midwest-sounding speech of American broadcasters then you may need to make a visit to a speech coach.  Simply watching movies or listening to radio isn't very effective if you already know english.<br>  <br>  If you want to try learning the American accent on your own, you need to learn phonetics, and you can train yourself to say the syllables and consonants in the right way.

And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <br>  <br>  16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. <br>  <br>  16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.        <br>  16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.         <br>  <br>  16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.              <br>  <br>  16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. <br>  <br>  16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. <br>  <br>  16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.|`|jOwH96wKaa	Hell to the yes.<br>  <br>  No matter what channel I turn to, I should be able to see BOOBS.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	IDK I cancelled cable b/c I never watch tv - I'm too busy having sex.<br>  <br>  BTW she's married to some other dude whom she has since kicked out of the house.

XLXncQu9aa	Community service can help to cut down on drugs and violence, especially amongst young teens, and young adults.  Community service offers a way to keep teens and young adults busy instead of having them on the streets making trouble or selling drugs.  The key word here is "busy".  When you are busy doing something worth while that makes less time for drugs and violence.  Teens that are involved in drugs and violence usually have nothing to do outside of that.  Once school is out they revert to the streets because they have no goals.  Community service can stimulate the mind, help the community to grow, and it can cause the students or young adults to be inspired to do good things rather than destroy their own lives.  Activities can include, planting trees in the community, clothing drives, food drives for the homeless, going to soup kitchens to serve the less fortunate, re-building broken buildings and homes, cleaning up parks, etc.  There are many ways to help the community.  Doing these activities takes the time from students and young adults that they could be using to do drugs and commit crimes and instead provides them with a creative outlet.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Awesome answer Friendly Stranger!

There is some disagreement on this point. Many say black represents death and can thus be used as a symbol to express vengeance towards a foe.

Congratulations! And welcome to the family! I understand your excited longings for what is going to happen next!<br>  <br>  There is an emotional response which makes us want to feel more! and more! and more!<br>  <br>  There is also the part where we must settle down and get serious and graduate from Christian  "kindergarten" and study seriously as Paul said, "to find yourself approved." Meaning we have got to learn and seek knowledge so that our actions will be informed actions, not just running around like a chicken with the head cut off!  <br>  <br>  Go to Church and enjoy the wonderful emotional infilling  when you pray and sing in the spirit.  Worship our wonderful Father God.  But quietly,  every day, ask His guidance and ask for wisdom then open your Bible and fill yourself with the knowledge that you  need,  to take your self to the next level!  <br>  <br>  The Bible tells us, "If anyone lacks wisdom, let him ask and it will be given !"   So ALWAYS start  your day with that request! <br>  ALWAYS start your Bible reading with that request! And You will grow wise  in your FAITH!  <br>  <br>  YOU HAVE ENTERED ON A MOST THRILLING VOYAGE!   <br>  <br>  May your life be filled with His overflowing Love and kindness which you, in turn will pour out on all with whom you come into contact!<br>  P.S.

Maybe that's your calling, but personally I believe that you have to contribute to building your community and improving people's lives in order to get closer to God.  It can't be a selfish thing (which arguably going to church is - you're focusing on you and God) it has to be open and compassionate and directed outward to other people.<br>  <br>  That said, that's just my personal view - everyone has a different calling.

Most people who want the Holy Ghost and speaking in tongues spend a great deal of time in prayer, and some even fast. This hunger you feel is a good thing, it means you are on the right track. Get out your Bible and read and pray, then pray some more...not everyone who gets the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues, but when you get it, you will Know...you will have a peace and joy that passes all understanding. This peace will help you when dealing with people who would try to bring you down or tell you your faith is stupid or crazy (and people will, it is something that people of all religious faiths deal with). Never let go of your faith...it can see you through some really tough times, even when it looks like a hopeless situation. There are some doctrines that tell you that speaking in tongues is the only evidence of the Holy Ghost...and there are others who do not believe in the indwelling of the Holy Ghost at all. I happen to believe that you can have the Holy Ghost evidenced by other factors than speaking in tongues...like peace and joy. If you belong to one of those churches that believe that speaking in tongues is the only evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost, forgive me if I have offended you. Congratulations on being Saved! Draw close to Him and He will draw closer to you...you do that by prayer and by learning His word. The rest will follow.|`|EVSwa73Caa	To be fully filled with the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues doesn't happen from one day to the other. You must understand that we have a sinful nature we must crucify and in which is the one that separates us from God. <br>  <br>  Now the first step you must follow is get baptiste and become a member of your church (in this process your pastor or leader need to give you classes and explain to you the true meaning of baptism and why we get baptiste.)  After that you need to give up all your sinful ways (which includes changing your attitude, way of living and way of thinking to what the bible teaches you.)  and never turn back to them.<br>  <br>  You have to worship the Lord with all your heart, mind and soul by putting a big effort in studying his word, talking to him in prayer, fasting, worshiping him all throughout your days and putting him above all things in your life.<br>  <br>  So you see sin and sin it's self is what keeps us from feeling or hearing our Lord and that is why we must put our part and get ride of sin from our life's by looking and searching for God with all our hearts and giving up all our sinful pleasures, ways of doing things and thinking.<br>  <br>  I know this might be a lot, but ask one of your church leaders to guide you throughout this proses.<br>  <br>  Remember the farther you get from sin the closer you get to God.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|jN5SXl5Caa	I'll try to explain ti to you this way. You want to feel something you don't truly understand. You can never prove or disprove a feeling. These people you speak of. How do we know they are being filled with the holy spirit? Because they tell us? Because the leader (sorry you didn't say what religion)said they were? All it comes down to is that you believe that your god created this whole world. He took his time and made it special for all of us. So go see what he made you. <br>  Example<br>  you give your significant other a box. In this box are little compartments and pictures and all kinds of fun stuff. You took the time to create it and give it to them. Now would you rather have them put it up on a shelf or in another box some where. ANd they would only look at it on this certain day or in a certain place, but never truly opening it. Never look and appreciating all this that you gave the?. Or would you want them to see what you made them. Look for the hard to find things, and everyday use it not just worship but actually put your gift into action? Remember you can only save yourself, yourself is the only one that will save you.|`|ogcUY6XXaa	God doesn't want our religion!!! He wants a personal relationship. Id encourage you to simply tell God how you feel, through prayer. When Jesus taught his disciples to pray to God, he said to seek Him as their father (he used the word Abba, which in Aramaic is similar to daddy). Also, get into the Bible (God's inspired word) and seek to find out how God wants us to live our lives.. The first and most important thing is that you trust Him. God, through the Bible, says that without faith it's impossible to please Him. Its by faith that we even believe He exists. Hebrews chapter 11 is called the hall of faith (check it out). From the old testament, back with Abraham, it was always about faith (trusting God) in everything. Jesus Christ is the most important person in the Bible. Make sure you know why He came down to earth, and that your trusting Him that He took your death sentence away and that He took the punishment you deserved because of sin. Don't worry about speaking in tongues and gettin' high on the Holy Ghost, God works all those things out. He gives the Spirit as He desires. What he wants first is for us to know Him, cuz that's what eternal life is all about: Jesus said in John 17:3 "Now this is eternal life, that they may know You the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."|`|m001xWWKaa	You must have done something awful to feel that you need to force yourself onto Jesus like this.

We all need to question the way we worship and confirm in the bible, God's Word, whether it is something pleasing or not.<br>  <br>  Is the Gift of Tongues Part of True Christianity?<br>  “I FELT, as I listened to him praying in tongues, as if there were an electrifying charge in the air,” said Bill after he and six others had gathered before the preacher near the church altar. Do such experiences repeat the first-century operation of the holy spirit? Do they identify the religion of the Bible? We can find satisfying answers by carefully examining the Scriptures.<br>  The Bible record reveals that when any miraculous gift of the spirit was transmitted, at least one of the 12 apostles or the apostle Paul was present. The first of three recorded instances of speaking in tongues occurred among 120 of Jesus’ disciples gathered in Jerusalem at Pentecost 33?C.E. (Acts 2:1-4) Three and a half years later, while a group of uncircumcised Italians were listening to Peter preach, they received the spirit and began “speaking with tongues and magnifying God.” (Acts 10:44-48) And 19 years after Pentecost, about 52?C.E., Paul spoke to a group in Ephesus and laid his hands upon 12 disciples. They too “began speaking with tongues and prophesying.”—Acts 19:6.<br>  Why the Gift of Tongues?<br>  Just before he ascended to heaven, Jesus told his followers: “You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you, and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and .?.?. to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Notice that he thus gave indication of just how this monumental witness work would be accomplished—with the assistance of the holy spirit.<br>  Modern communication technology that enables us to send messages earth wide in many languages did not exist back then. The good news had to be spread primarily by word of mouth, and in this the miraculous gift of speaking in foreign tongues would prove very helpful. Such was the case as first-century Christians preached to Jews and proselytes in Jerusalem at Pentecost 33?C.E. Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Cretans, Arabians, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and the district of Asia, as well as sojourners from Rome, heard “the magnificent things of God” in their own language and understood what was said. Three thousand quickly became believers.—Acts 2:5-11,?41.<br>  An oft-overlooked fact is that speaking in tongues was just one of the nine operations of the holy spirit that the apostle Paul mentioned in his letter to the Christians in Corinth. Although Paul viewed speaking in tongues as a lesser gift, it was valuable to the early congregation in spreading the good news about the heavenly Kingdom of God. It was one of the “gifts” that contributed to the numerical growth and upbuilding of the infant congregation of Christians.—1?Corinthians 12:7-11; 14:24-26.<br>  The various operations of the holy spirit in the first century, including speaking in tongues, were also a visible evidence that God was no longer using the 1,500-year-old congregation of Israel as his special people. Unquestionably, his approval now rested with the new Christian congregation, established by his only-begotten Son.—Compare Hebrews 2:2-4.<br>  These manifestations of the spirit were key building blocks in establishing the young Christian congregation and helping it to grow to adulthood. Paul explained that after having served their purpose, these miraculous gifts would cease: “Whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease.”—1?Corinthians 13:8.<br>  Yes, the Bible is clear that the gift of tongues would cease. But when? Acts 8:18 reveals that the gifts of the spirit were received “through the laying on of the hands of the apostles.” Evidently, then, with the death of the last apostle, the passing on of the gifts of the spirit would stop—including speaking in tongues. Hence, when those who had received these gifts from the apostles also passed off the earthly scene, the miraculous gift would cease. By then the Christian congregation would have had time to become well established and would have spread to many lands.<br>  “Unknown Tongues” and Their Interpretation<br>  The present-day resurgence of speaking in tongues has been “regarded by some as the emotional extravagance of unstable exhibitionists, while others regard it as identical with the phenomenon of speaking with tongues of Apostolic times.” In modern-day?church gatherings where speaking in “unknown tongues” occurs, it usually involves an ecstatic outburst of unintelligible sounds. Accordingly, one person confessed: “I use my gift of tongues mostly in private for my own meditation. .?.?. I feel a little embarrassed in front of other people.” Another related: “I hear my own words, I don’t understand them, but I keep feeling my tongue pushed to talk.”<br>  What information of real value is conveyed by such unknown tongues, and what about an|`|tl2pMkOcaa	You are "Consumed with the Lord" because you are participating in the frenzy called "Christian revival"<br>  <br>  Trust me, the only thing you will possibly feel are psychosomatic responses to hype!<br>  <br>  I know - I am an EX CHRISTIAN!<br>  <br>  1.

bR4BgFLlaa	Do you live in an isolated area or in a city/suburbs etc? You could try some volunteer work, I'm pretty sure you can be a volunteer without a work permit since you don't get paid. Depending upon your interest area (animals/kids/cancer/elderly) there may be a base near you where you can help other people and give yourself something really worthwhile to do. Also this will enhance your CV when the time comes that you are able to seek work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well you don't give specifics, so if I'm off base here, I apologize.<br>  <br>  First I sympathize with you. Unless you live within spitting distance of the Atlantic Ocean, most American Cities don't do a very good job at public transport, and not having a car means you are almost under House Arrest. That can be rough.<br>  <br>  That being said, you are thinking of yourself as a victim here, not as a resource. Don't be thinking about "What can I do to entertain myself?" think about "What can I do for others?"<br>  <br>  America was built by private individuals helping each other. (This whole "Big Government knows best" thing didn't happen till the 1930s.)  There is still a strong volunteer tradition here in the US and there are plenty of groups that could use your help. I am sure that if you called one they could arrange for rides for you if you needed one...they would just be happy to have the help. <br>  <br>  Here are some examples of ones from around my area<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ywca.org/site/pp.asp?c=djISI6PIKpG&b=284783" rel="nofollow">http://www.ywca.org/site/pp.asp?c=djISI6...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.handsoncentraltexas.org/?gclid=CNPppO6HipkCFRdinAodv0t4mQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.handsoncentraltexas.org/?gcli...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.houstonfoodbank.org/volunteer.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonfoodbank.org/volunteer...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sleh.com/sleh/Section004/index.cfm?pagename=Volunteering&PageMD=VOLUNTEERING" rel="nofollow">http://www.sleh.com/sleh/Section004/inde...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alz.org/join_the_cause_volunteering.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.alz.org/join_the_cause_volunt...</a><br>  <br>  Second, I would strongly recomend that you get involved in a good Church. Some place like this <a href="http://www.fotw.org/main/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fotw.org/main/</a><br>  You can see that a good church is involved in a lot of different things, and it will have not just opportunities to provide you with support and fellowship, but also opportunities for you to be of service to others. <br>  <br>  A good church will be full of friednly helpful people who will be happy to help you out, and they are used to arranging for transport for people and other special needs.<br>  <br>  Lastly, take a class. No law says you have to take classes for credit, you can just go a learn something. This is a good example. <a href="http://www.llu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.llu.com/</a> if you check them out you will see that they have classes in just about everything. <a href="http://www.llu.com/sdc/sgroups.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llu.com/sdc/sgroups.html</a><br>  <br>  Lastly, if your husband is on a student visa that means you are in or around a college campus. Campuses have tons of ways for people to get involved. For example many of them have ethinic organizations, (They are often called things like the "Black Student Union" or "Asian Student Union") and if there happens to be one from your ethnic group I'm sure they would welcome your involvement. Even if they don't have an ethnic organization, there may a language club, (for example when I was in school I was in a Russian club for a while when I briefly and unsucessfuly tried to learn Russian).  If the college teaches courses in your first language then you could help tutor people in the language. <br>  <br>  There should also be some sort of "International Students Association" there. Hunt around the school website. I'm sure you aren't the first person this has happened to. They might be able to help. <br>  <br>  You might be able to audit classes at the school too (that is where they don't give you credit for the class, but you get to go for free or almost free).  Also there should be a gym... check and see what the rules are about you your being able to use it. It should be allowed. Failing that join the local YMCA <a href="http://www.ymca.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ymca.net/</a> .  Our local Y has lots of classes, from exercise to martial arts. <br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless|`|GPznIhzMaa	Volunteer for a local non-profit organization or join a religious affiliation.

TyRfv0eoaa	I would agree with that assessment. It's also illogical. Since the Hebrew and Greek texts are available for comparison, anyone with a good education can compare and see that all English translations have errors, and none is really more accurate than others. They may not all contain the same errors, but they all contain about the same number of errors.|`|EBGdlo35aa	Well, no.  Clearly, that is not a logical conclusion.<br>  <br>  That's like saying that if I prefer a particular English translation of "Around the World in 80 Days", that I place more faith in that translator than in the author.  In fact, what it means is that I place more faith in that translator than in any of the competing English translators.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|i444oWjjaa	They think the "Holy Spirit" guided the men who created the KJV.<br>  <br>  How convenient. The version they think is legitimate just happens to be written in English. If it was in Cyrillic (Russian) I doubt they would agree.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Yes.  I prefer the NRSV but even in that highly respected version I have found some unjustifiable errors.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes, but the less syllables, the better.<br>  <br>  "The KJV because it is most accurate. There was a study done on all the versions, and the KJV has the least amount of syllables which relates to why the KJV is most accurate." - a really dumb fundie who needs words with less syllables.
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	The teachings, the doctrines are the same. You can go to another ward and they will be teaching the same teachings out of the same manuals. Although some variation in teaching styles have to be given. It's the same thing. <br>  <br>  I went once to a LDS church in France. It was the same teachings and the people were incredibly friendly. <br>  <br>  Although my mom shared her conversion story to the LDS church once with me. She went to this one church and they decided to dress up as clowns as they were going to be "fools for Christ" she didn't like it. She thought it was sacrilegious and profaning the divinity of Christ. She could not stay there and so she left this church. There were many members of the LDS faith around and they kept witnessing the truth to her. She read the Book of Mormon, and my father did as well. One thing lead to another and they joined the church. But needless to say being dissatisfied with another church can happen. But the thing with the LDS church the Doctrines are the same all over.|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	You know it doesn't happen that way in the LDS Church! The Sunday School manual and the priesthood/Relief Society manual are used wherever another ward or branch exists.<br>  <br>  It may not always be the same chapter world-wide, but it is close and the doctrine is unmistakable in its concept to all Latter-day Saints.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	I would say it is differant in UT, I hear the orotection temple garment stories only in UT, as a matter of fact, I get to hear a new one each time I visit,outside of Ut, the mormons claim this is not a fact. The mormons in Ut tend to be more radical then mormons outside of UT. <br>  I have also found the mormons of today to be brought up on a differant mormonism then I was when I grew up in UT.|`|Rcv1c1j1aa	Always for you.|`|TwcAQPupaa	That's one of my favorite parts of the church.  No matter where I go, I pretty much know what to expect.  I love that.|`|An1jCPWRaa	every church has their own special way of doing things<br>  but they all basically teach the same things|`|AA11713693	It is the same all over the world no matter where you are and no matter what language you speak.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Relativly little.  <br>  <br>  There are some areas where there are lots of members who know the doctrine and scriptures very well.  In other areas there are fewer members or they are newer to the church.  So, sometimes these things come up because people don't know or understand the doctrine as well as they probably should, but considering that it is a world-wide church, it happens very little.
dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	The naivete of some people amazes me.  Just because someone votes a certain way and uses financial resources to protect THEIR OWN rights, does not mean that they "hate" someone else. <br>  <br>  On a smaller scale, it would be like saying because I voted for so and so who supports putting in a stop sign at the dangerous street corner I live near means I hate everyone that drives fast.   No, it simply means I want to protect my rights near my street.<br>  <br>  LDS believe that gay people can (and already do) have the right to "civil unions" which affords them every single right a married couple do.   Changing the name of such unions to "marriage" does not add or detract ANY right, yet it would detract from those who official are married.<br>  <br>  If you knew the facts, you would know that this is true.<br>  However, those that speak in the name of "rights" seemingly are oblivious to the fact that they are indeed taking away rights from those who advocate marriage. Ironic if you ask me....|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Love the "Don't answer if you're not LDS."  It's a public forum, you know.  <br>  I don't believe most mormons hate gays, though I've had relatives tell me they'd be ashamed if their child was gay. (all my relatives are LDS).  <br>  They've simply been convinced that homosexual relationships are somehow evil and sinful and should be condemned.  The old "love the sinner, hate the sin" is nothing but bunk--you can't hate something that's part of someone's nature (homosexuality) and still love the person.<br>  BTW, Kerry, gay marriage takes absolutely no rights away from straight people.<br>  Oh, and Yoda's, gay people don't need or want your pity, either.  Acceptance would be much more Christlike.|`|634jf1L4aa	LDS people do not hate gay people.  We believe every person regardless of their race, background, views in a son or daughter of our Heavenly Father.  The Latter-day Saint Church believes that marriage is ordained or God between a man and a woman only.  Same-sex relationships are contrary to Heavenly Father's plan because they inhibit having His children come into the world born to a father and a mother.  Each parent sex has their own personal traits that contribute to the success of the family.<br>  Here is a link to many sources on the Churches stance on gay marriage:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/same-sex-marriage-and-proposition-8" rel="nofollow">http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/...</a>|`|TwcAQPupaa	I can't speak for other Mormons, although our doctrine teaches not to hate.  I have had many gay friends.  But they refused to be friends with me after Prop 8 passed.  I still love them.  I may not agree with the lifestyle they have chosen, but they are all good people.  They have the same basic rights as I do, they can marry anyone they want of a different gender, just like me.  This is a debate that will go on for a very long time.  One side is not going to change the minds of the other side.  It's extremely controversial.|`|AA10031161	My brother is sometimes a pain- he's pretty arrogant, selfish, egocentric, pushy.... but I don't hate him.<br>  <br>  I have other friends (mostly women) who are gay. I don't hate them, but they're not my first choice in who to hang out with.<br>  <br>  Mostly, when I think of them, I feel sad. My perception is that God's laws/commandments are for our happiness, and gays have chosen a lifestyle contrary to those laws, only leading to their sorrow... and I'm sad that my friends and my brother have chosen disobedience and sorrow.|`|MJMsOFpiaa	No I don't really hate anything or anyone. I recognize that it's their choice. But I am mildly annoyed with them though.  As I am with anyone who insists on following what I believe to be wrong. Honestly, it's like seeing a teenage girl in a shopping mall so absorbed in herself and you want to tell her to snap out of it and look around.<br>  But as people, as long as they don't directly tell me that I'm stupid I don't go up to them and start disrespecting them. People are People.|`|5mb1bnvxaa	i'm just curious... What does LDS mean??|`|W9uEeFFsaa	NO|`|b95d3948683c7afd43c89eba8e412306aa	I don't hate anyone that comes from with in, I don't hate any group that for me would be a resentment or short coming and a personal defect of myself, People that hate need therapy or need to be transported into the people they hate, to know what amount of persecution they would be able to endure.|`|bi3XdkMEaa	Why should I hate them? They have nothing done to me, that I should hate them, and even if.<br>  An important commandment of the gospel is forgiveness. We are not allowed to hate anybody but to love everyone. Allthough we cannot agree with sin, there is no reason to hate the sinner. To have my peace with myself, it is better for me not to hate anyone.|`|An1jCPWRaa	every lds has their own view on gay people just like any other person<br>  personally i dont hate gays<br>  they're just like every1 els<br>  they just like people of the same sex|`|Fh3lH8jgaa	LDS = Latter Day Saint|`|jdRKZe18aa	Not one iota do I hate gay people or any other people..... They are Gods children just the same as you or I and He loves them just as much as He loves anyone else.....<br>  <br>  NO LDS person that I know hates gay people - some don't come across very liberally minded about homosexuality or accepting of alternative lifestyles - but NONE hate.  99% of the mormons I know are among some of the most loving people I've ever known or met.  <br>  HATE is a very strong word that you will SELDOM EVER hear an LDS person ever use!  <br>  <br>  I FIND IT very sad that a people or person can't stand up for what they feel is RIGHT in God's eyes without being labeled hateful, bigoted and so viciously judged for utilizing their own free speech and freedom of religion.....   SO DOES THAT MEAN Freedom of Religion and Speech is ONLY applicable if you agree with Gay people then?  It just makes no sense to me!  Either we are ALL FREE to take personal moral stands in this country or we aren't......  Just because it's a homosexual issue doesn't make it any less a freedom of choice stand does it?|`|AA11713693	No I don't hate them. Jesus once taught "Love the sinner, hate the sin."|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	I do not hate homosexuals. I once worked with a couple. They were extremly friendly and well intentioned. Do I believe in their lifestyle? No. That is not to say that I don't believe that homosexuals don't deserve rights. They deserve the right to inherit their partner's property, they deserve the right to visit each other in the hospital, they deserve the right to have as a couple medical benfits. They deserve the right to be together. However, what does this have to do with marriage? Absolutely nothing. All those are legal rights and have nothing to do with the whole concept of marriage. <br>  <br>  But as a God fearing person, I have the right to stand up and say no. Our country gives us the right to speak out and to participate in a democracy.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Do you really think any LDS is going to admit to hatred? Actions speak louder than words... and so do dollars. The Church of LDS made their hatred loud and clear when they poured money into Prop 8, to take a basic civil right away from others.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	To "little legend": LDS is short for "Latter Day Saints."|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Nope.

Basically just defend yourself, don't let people walk all over you. Be the person that people are afraid of, or people will make you afraid. So if you want to cuss a person out, at least do it in a way that won't get you in trouble but will leave your enemy depressed and with low confidence.|`|c0LfBdNlaa	i think your a dumb ***** who needs to go **** your self god damnet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For the same reason that "thou shalt not kill" does not mean "thou shalt not eat hamburgers", "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image" does not mean (clearly) that *all* types of "graven images" are forbidden.  If they were, then all forms of killing would likewise be forbidden, and there would be no cherubim included in the holiest artifact in all of Judaism.<br>  <br>  The prohibition is against idols (or any type of image) produced for the purpose of worshiping such.  The cherubim of the ark of the covenant were not created so that they might be worshiped, and (according to Roman Catholic doctrine) the worship of statues is likewise not permitted.<br>  <br>  I think that answers your question.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|AA10034051	Nope not at all. We dont worship false god's we only worship God Almighty. Do you have pictures of your family? Do you worship them when you look at them?<br>  <br>  Here are the 10 Commandments that the Catholic Church follows. They are no different then what is in the bible or what you protestant fundies follow, just numbered different<br>  <br>  1.You shall have no other gods before me.<br>  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.<br>  2.You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.<br>  3.Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.<br>  4.Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.<br>  5.You shall not murder.<br>  6.You shall not commit adultery.<br>  7.You shall not steal.<br>  8.You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.<br>  9.You shall not covet your neighbor's house.<br>  10. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor|`|g4AAZRuxaa	According to the Bible yes.|`|AA11796124	That is NOT the Second Commandment. That's actually part of the First. And no, Catholics do not break that Commandment.<br>  <br>  Images and Statues<br>  Deut. 4:15 - from this verse, Protestants say that since we saw "no form" of the Lord, we should not make graven images of Him.<br>  <br>  Deut. 4:16 - of course, in early history Israel was forbidden to make images of God because God didn't yet reveal himself visibly "in the form of any figure." <br>  <br>  Deut. 4:17-19 - hence, had the Israelites depicted God not yet revealed, they might be tempted to worship Him in the form of a beast, bird, reptile or fish, which was a common error of the times. <br>  <br>  Exodus 3:2-3; Dan 7:9; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 2:3- later on, however, we see that God did reveal himself in visible form (as a dove, fire, etc). <br>  <br>  Deut. 5:8 - God's commandment "thou shall not make a graven image" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped. <br>  <br>  Exodus 25:18-22; 26:1,31 - for example, God commands the making of the image of a golden cherubim. This heavenly image, of course, is not worshiped by the Israelites. Instead, the image disposes their minds to the supernatural and draws them to God. <br>  <br>  Num. 21:8-9 - God also commands the making of the bronze serpent. The image of the bronze serpent is not an idol to be worshiped, but an article that lifts the mind to the supernatural. <br>  <br>  I Kings 6:23-36; 7:27-39; 8:6-67 - Solomon's temple contains statues of cherubim and images of cherubim, oxen and lions. God did not condemn these images that were used in worship. <br>  <br>  2 Kings 18:4 - it was only when the people began to worship the statue did they incur God's wrath, and the king destroyed it. The command prohibiting the use of graven images deals exclusively with the false worship of those images. <br>  <br>  1 Chron. 28:18-19 - David gives Solomon the plan for the altar made of refined gold with a golden cherubim images. These images were used in the Jews' most solemn place of worship. <br>  <br>  2 Chron. 3:7-14 - the house was lined with gold with elaborate cherubim carved in wood and overlaid with gold. <br>  <br>  Ezek. 41:15 - Ezekiel describes graven images in the temple consisting of carved likenesses of cherubim. These are similar to the images of the angels and saints in many Catholic churches. <br>  <br>  Col. 1:15 - the only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the "image" (Greek "eikon") of the invisible God.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No, not at all. <br>  <br>  Would you agree that a false god, or idol can also be a non-statue, non-image? How many people worship money, sex, others, or their selves? It's so silly to make it all about statues...<br>  <br>  God commanded that statues be made for the temple. Statues of angels and other things. So obviously the issue wasn't the image or statue but the worship of what it represents. There is the crux. We say we don't worship the images of Mary or the Saints, many Protestants say we do. But for me...I know I don't and God knows I don't. So what others think is of no consequence.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	A statue is only an idol when you pray to it.  They don't pray to the statue.<br>  <br>  When do you ever hear a Catholic say, "My lord and savior Mr. Statue" or "our image and likeness to art in heaven"?  When you see them praying, ask them who they're praying to and they'll tell you it's God.  You DO know Catholics are Christians, right?<br>  <br>  Many of the answers so far have been downright idiotic.|`|nS83ag9raa	so you are saying for 1500 years before the reformation..there were nothign but a bunch of sinful commandment breakers on the planet???|`|VFWRdAH3aa	that is talking about WORSHIPPING images. the statues, etc. we use them to teach those who can not read about the teachings of the Catholic Church.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	No.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	No, because we do not worship (bow down to them) or serve them|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	No, we don't.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	of course they do!<br>  <br>  there's tons of scriptures that say any image for any means is wrong. but this is my favorite:<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 10: 3,4<br>  <br>  3.

Many mortals have suffered torture and death to save those they didnt know, they have done it without the promise of eternal life.....|`|AA11719394	The answer to this question has many facets. First, there is no doubt the religious leaders of Israel were responsible for Jesus’ death. Matthew 26:3-4 tells us that “the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, assembled together to the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. And they consulted so that they might take Jesus by guile and kill Him.” The Jewish leaders demanded of the Romans that Jesus be put to death (Matthew 27:22-25). They couldn’t continue to allow Him to work signs and wonders because it threatened their position and place in the religious society they dominated (John 11:47-50), so “they plotted to put Him to death” (John 11:53).<br>  <br>  The Romans were the ones who actually crucified Him (Matthew 27:27-37). Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution, authorized and carried out by the Romans under the authority of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who sentenced Jesus. Roman soldiers drove the nails into His hands and feet, Roman troops erected the cross and a Roman solider pierced His side (Matthew 27:27-35).<br>  <br>  The people of Israel were also complicit in the death of Jesus. They were the ones who shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” as He stood on trial before Pilate (Luke 23:21). They also cried for the thief Barabbas to be released instead of Jesus (Matthew 27:21). Peter confirmed this in Acts 2:22-23 when he told the men of Israel “you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified and put to death” Jesus of Nazareth. In fact the murder of Jesus was a conspiracy involving Rome, Herod, the Jewish leaders and the people of Israel, a diverse group of people who never worked together on anything before or since, but who came together this one time to plot and carry out the unthinkable – the murder of the son of God.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, and perhaps somewhat amazingly, it was God Himself who put Jesus to death. This was the greatest act of divine justice ever carried out, done in “the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God” (Acts 2:23) and for the highest purpose. Jesus’ death on the cross secured the salvation of countless millions and provided the only way God could forgive sin without compromising His holiness and perfect righteousness. Christ’s death was God’s perfect plan for the eternal redemption of His own.<br>  <br>  So we who have come to Christ in faith are guilty of His blood, shed on the cross for us. He died to pay the penalty for our sins (Romans 5:8; 6:23). In the movie "The Passion of the Christ," the director, Mel Gibson, was the one whose hands you see actually driving the nails through Christ's hands. He did it that way to remind himself, and everyone else, that it was our sins that nailed Jesus to the cross.|`|B3r6GViTaa	a christian would say that God and jesus are one in the same. god had the power to save himself, but didn't. jesus suffered, but God willingly died for us. or something.|`|1BHE48aPaa	The sacrifice is what is killed.<br>  Not what kills.<br>  Right?<br>  If You sacrificed Him, He'd still be the sacrifice. ;)|`|Ac3Z0RLuaa	because he chose to die.<br>  He could have avoided his conviction, <br>  by not preaching amoung other things... <br>  <br>  By taking his punishment of dying on the cross, he payed for all of our sins.|`|JXzqhYDSaa	It is a sacrifice because  he chose to do die.

God provides us with both seemingly unbearable pain and with unconditional love and strength. Life is a blackboard on which God writes lessons and we learn them. Only thing, life is completely opposite that of a school- We have to first write an examination and then we learn the lesson. You have surely heard the story of the  'Footprints in the Sand'. Here's it anyway:<br>  <br>  One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the LORD.<br>  <br>  Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one belonging to him, and the other to the LORD.<br>  <br>  When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand.<br>  <br>  He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints.<br>  <br>  He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life.<br>  <br>  This really bothered him and he questioned the LORD about it:<br>  <br>  "LORD, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life,there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me."<br>  <br>  The LORD replied: "My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you."<br>  <br>  <br>  -Author Unknown|`|mC4mnvGFaa	so, then when you have kids, you're going natural all the way?<br>  <br>  EDIT: on a serious note, if there was a god, he sure isn't doing much to alleviate anyone's pain, either physical or mental|`|EoDeSDnmaa	I disagree.

He does not give us pain. Life does. If we have faith, we gain the courage or strength to live through it. He does not bring disaster, death, destruction. Nature does and Man does. God created everything, set it in motion, and put us here to decide whether to believe in Him or not. The rest is up to us. We can choose to believe or not believe. In choosing to believe, we gain faith and hope and strength to get through all the bad stuff. The idea being to get through this life and have a better one that lasts longer later. Non-believers say religion is a crutch. I say, so what if it is or what if it isn't? What difference could it possibly make? Why do they care so much anyway? Everyone seems to be trying to sway others to their way of thinking. Personally, I would rather Know than Think...and I Know God is real, and faith in Him can get you through anything.|`|ELee6O3Kaa	God never wants his children to suffer.Its us who goes against him as we are given the free will to act on our own.Hence,we fall in to the trap thats been laid by the satan and we suffer.It is him who is inflicting all the pains and not God.He never will.|`|641d79f1fb962fec1327d88ec4977c9daa	It says that "Our Creator's Strength is made Perfect in weakness."<br>  Doesn't it take a lot of pain to make a hard-headed man turn to his Maker?

America is a very religious country, but Very Lost.<br>  <br>  Perhaps this site will help?<br>    <br>  <a href="http://www.gty.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gty.org/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking!  <br>  Cordially, RR|`|mFGyonmTaa	Actually, many Christians do not understand their own beliefs (the history, origins, contradictions, AND truths).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most true Atheists have had experience with religion, and that is the very reason why they reject it...|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Often those who reject religion understand more about it than those who follow it.<br>  <br>  I was born and raised a christian. I was baptized and had to go to church for almost 3 hours every sunday so I know what I'm talking about.<br>  Now i'm agnostic.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Okay, explain it. <br>  <br>  How does a person get into heaven, according to the Bible?<br>  <br>  Since, you're saying that you understand it. <br>  <br>  What you rejected, probably isn't the true Gospel that saves anyway.|`|212F2EO0aa	Why bother.<br>  <br>  Jesus said He was the way the truth and the life and nobody could got to the Father except through him.<br>  <br>  I don't need to understand  other religions it to know its false|`|gSxYuDEEaa	If you understand what Christ did for you and then reject you are far worse then the one who rejects it based on not understanding it.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Empathy and tolerance for people who aren't like them has never been Christianity's strong suit...|`|jOPUBmlJaa	They think they are special. They are "god's children", that means anyone who doesn't read a book made of dead trees and ink won't go to a pearly gates. What about babies then?|`|AA12045802	Have to understand something to disagree with it.|`|A9oWuOFBaa	I understand it very well, which is exactly why I left it.|`|EueaG0EBaa	because they like to judge|`|N6rHtZ4qaa	why do you care?<br>  feeling guilty, i see.|`|9qmWUg6xaa	It is easier to disagree with what you understand.  The problem that the vocal Christians have is that they don't fully understand their religion, or religion and humanity in general.  They have a limited viewpoint that their religion is right and all others are wrong, and to them it is obvious.  As such, they naturally assume that if you don't follow their religion, then you don't fully understand it.<br>  <br>  The same can be said of all religions.|`|McFiBtxuaa	I guess they think that once you fully understand it, you cannot deny it.  Everyone thinks their religion is the one and only true religion, so if you still have doubts or reject it, they believe you must have not understood it all, since their religion answers all the questions, however illogical.<br>  <br>  I think it's possible to fully understand it and disagree. Most religions come from the same source, it's just changed over time as it's filtered through culture and passed on from one generation to the next. Kinda like playing "telephone," where one person starts out saying something to the next, and by the end you have a completely different thing.<br>  <br>  No religion provides ALL the answers with credible evidence to back it up, otherwise we wouldn't have such a mix of opinions. So, yes you can disagree with it. You can fully understand another person's opinion about something but disagree with it, religion's the same way.<br>  <br>  Christianity is just the largest religion in the world so far, so many people are probably boggled that you can reject such a widely "known" thing.|`|AA11189767	It runs against the grain of most Christians to have someone deny what they believe to be Gospel.  Since anyone with intelligence, brains, and the capacity to think would obviously be a Christian, then if you reject the doctrine, you must not be very smart, and thus need to be educated.   <br>  <br>  And yes, the sarcasm is intended.|`|JqzZabXcaa	not all of us do. im a christian and if someone else is not i accept it i have atheist friends a friend who is hindu and a friend who practices wicca. there are also different types of christianity and some people who say they are christians just think they are better then others. I absolutely cant stand some people at my church. im not saying its ok to not be a christian because you need jesus in your life to go to heaven. if you accept christ into your heart and try to do the right thing then you have been saved. if you don't, when judgment day comes you will have to answer for every wrong decision you have made. when you have the lord with you no one can be against you. though people may prosecute you for your beliefs your reward will be great in heaven. i wish i could help you more but not even most chrisians fully understand christianity. i sugest going to a contempary methodist church service. we are the most fun!|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	It's quite possible, but I get the impression that it's not the case most of the time... Hell, even believers don't fully understand their religion.|`|IiWz11Kraa	I assume they didnt understand|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	They are not of the same intellectual level as your typical atheist.  They can't understand thought processes outside of their circular reasoning.|`|HBp5r76haa	If you truly understood the sacrifice that Christ did for us, you would have no choice but to fall on your knees and cry "Holy".<br>  <br>  How can you disagree with such infinite grace and mercy?<br>  <br>  Even for those who follow Him, the realization of what He did and does in our lives is a continuous revelation - day by day - until we will be in His presence.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Probably for the same reason that so many atheists assume I don't understand atheism because I reject it.  Both sides think their view is true.  It's not too much of a stretch to conclude that proper understanding should produce agreement.  After all, how can one fully understand the truth and still disagree with it?<br>  <br>  peace|`|i6QfwNTJaa	because they think us atheist dont have a brain to think with. LOL!<br>  nice right?<br>  because i would say that they dont know much about us that's why.<br>  because we know more about them. the bible has many uses. it's a manual on how to deal with a person who deals with some serious illusions. and needs help.|`|mSFjbetxaa	I think that with understanding comes enlightenment.

And why scientists accept it as a valid theory. Are you REALLY that worried about ancestors from that far back in history? If you are, then you're probably the kind of person who locks away the family idiot in the basement so that people don't realize he or she is related to you. So, relax, learn, and be happy for being who you are without worrying about things that don't really change any of that.|`|7Vz4Xk7Waa	do you really have to insult atheists? honestly? seriously? thats kinda pathetic. if you read the WHOLE theory of evolution and all of its branches such as speciation and adaptive radiation and natural selection and other stuff like that you wouldnt be an ignorant christian but a well informed one and then you can actually be a suppposedly civilized being which it seems most christians for all their claims of love and decency and openness arent.|`|vhlORK4Waa	No need to be rude.

OZjlW5utaa	Yes, who would want sh!t that symbolizes racism, ignorance and a violent racist past? A racist person IMO.<br>  <br>  Unless they are buying it for a museum or something though.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	most likely unless there buyers of a museum or something and want to put it on display because no matter what it is part of history. however if it it for just regular customers they have no initial use for it and there desire to have it must mean they obviously have a liking to the association of the memoralibia. However if someone offered it to me or i would take it just because its historical, but im not racist at all, its just an item of history tht would be cool to have to explain what it was and how this one thing is a symbol for murder basically. but yea for customers who dont think of it as historical items, they most likely are racist.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	They may collect it if they are like a history maniac or something...but yeah, chances are they are some kind of white supremacist.|`|kp3JRi72aa	Could just be interested in that part of history.|`|9ef2dd7c1bd63e15bb8ec89d386c526baa	No, simply possessing those items does not make you a racist.  You may be interested in WW2, or have a respect for the Emancipation, and purchase an item to remember what was overcome.  Or you could just be looking to buy now, and sell later for a profit.  Everything is valuable to someone for a variety of reasons.|`|crFl8m26aa	Either a Historian or a racist|`|96AQZUGyaa	Not necessarily.<br>  <br>  I have a collection of books about Communism and essays written by prominent communists through history.

cPQ7TBcuaa	I view socialists as slightly better than communists...but not by much. They're both fascists in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Add: Well, one part of me says that you should stand up for what you believe in...but another part of me says that you should deny the heII out of it and take it with you to your grave, lol. Or...you could just move to one of the socialist European countries and let your colors fly!<br>  <br>  Add: I went to a public school from K-12 and was raised in a lower class household. I am working my way through college now, living off of ramen noodles and potatoes! Don't tell me that people that oppose socialism are well-off and care for no one but themselves...For Christ's sake, I'm even going into social work! My perspective is that people appreciate things more that they have to actually put forth an effort to achieve...people toss aside the things that are handed to them. And yes, I know exactly what socialism and communism are.<br>  Someday, when I am well-off financially. I will appreciate the effort that I have made and I will be proud of myself...and I will NOT have to thank the government for my success.|`|m001xWWKaa	Most people that throw out that word don't even know what it means.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism</a><br>  Most people that ***** about socialism feel that the government is taking money straight from their purse and handing it to some bum on the street. <br>  In general, the ones who complain about this live a fairly privileged life and have no concern for anyone other than themselves.  They feel that everyone has a fair shot at life and just because they work hard, they don't see any reason why others can't do the same. <br>  They are too stupid to realize that not everyone has a fair shot at life, and if they would spend one week in the public school system they would see this first hand with the different students. There is a direct correlation between a students performance, and his/her life at home.  If the government could do anything to even the playing field a little it would benefit those who don't want to help the less fortunate out more than they realize.  Especially in the education field.  The more educated students that graduate, move onto higher education, and into the work force, the more money goes back into the economy, thus helping the stock market and the pockets of those who the government took from originally.|`|r1BycC7Xaa	If I lived in middle America I wouldn't wear it on a tee-shirt. I don't understand the big issue with socialism. I guess its because people will not be able to make money off other peoples back.
rThIVk2maa	Well, there are ways to let her know you like her without putting your heart on the chopping block. She probably already knows you like her because people give out those signals unconsciously. <br>  <br>  Just keep hanging out with her, spend time alone with her and do NOT jump the gun. This will take time, especially if she's just gotten over somebody else (don't be the rebound). <br>  <br>  Don't be in a hurry to define things, just let it develop over time. You can start buying her drinks, start paying for dinner if you like, invite her somewhere private, like to your house to watch movies and you two can snuggle on the couch.  Buy her flowers "just because" and see how she reacts.<br>  <br>  If she leaps into a new relationship quickly with somebody else, it's a good sign that she's not a good choice for you. You don't need a woman in  your life that is going to hop from person to person because that means she is insecure.|`|PCI0kQ57aa	come up and say  u want 2 no who i like then say u i love you i want to go out with you|`|6OFHemITaa	This is kinda' tough.  If you all are already good friends and hang around with each other and are very comfortable together, that can really be a great start.  I think that you should start by asking her what qualities she likes in a guy, what she is looking for in a boyfriend and if any of those qualities describe you, then you should ask her if she would feel comfortable going on a real date with you and seeing if you all hit it off.  If she laughs it off, or says she only wants to be friends, you can simply say, ya. that's what you thought too!  <br>  If you don't take a chance tho, you will never know and someone else might come along!<br>  Good luck anyway|`|AA10281237	I'm going to answer your second question first. For me, a guy I can see as a friend vs. one I can see as a boyfriend is all about attraction. I'm not being shallow here- everyone is attracted to differant things, so what I may be attracted to may not be what someone else is attracted to. But either way, a girl can think you're the nicest, best guy friend she has, and if she can't see herself wanting to be with you physically (kissing or otherwise) then she's not going to want you to be her boyfriend. This doesn't mean you're unattractive, just that this particular girl doesn't find you attractive. It's difficult to deal with, but it's true.<br>  <br>  Now, back to your first question. If it were me, I would want to know. That's the kind of person I am. I know that several of my guy friends find me attractive, and we're still just friends. If I were her, I would be fine with you just telling me that you think you like me as more than a friend, and if you told me that you would like to go on a date with me but that it was my decision, then I would be ok with that. I might say no, but I wouldn't want to stop being your friend.<br>  <br>  The danger of that is, of course, that she might say no. What you need to ask yourself is if you're ok with being her friend after she says no. Because if you're not comfortable with that, then you should just wait it out. <br>  <br>  Also, another tip to help you decide whether you want to mention something to her or wait it out- Does she seem comfortable around you? For example, when you're watching a movie or TV at one of your houses, does she sit in another chair, or does she sit close to you? Does she touch you at all when you're hanging out? Touch and body language are generally the easiest ways to tell if she likes you back. So if she seems like she's comfortable being up close and personal, then you should be save asking her out.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helps!|`|xnsU60hhaa	She could be feeling the exact same way and you don't even know. The only way to find out is to talk to her about it! And of course, then risk making yourself vulnerable, but at least you will know. Perhaps go out for a few drinks and you can blame it on the alcohol later? <br>  Good Luck!
81SiImlSaa	Although not a Christian I must tell you I find it more than a little funny, it is in fact a cheap and puerile attempt at insinuating religion into technology.|`|AA11719394	Absolutely ridiculous for one! this is exactly the kind of thing Jesus spoke about with the sabbath and keeping of the law! <br>  <br>  Instead of making all these useless sacrifices I think God would be a lot more pleased if people actually focused on drawing closer to Him, repenting of sin and living for Christ and do this not just for lent but all year through!!|`|yDkSq8rBaa	Since the Pope believes that he is able to forgive sins, and has changed two of the 10 commandments concerning idol worship and Sunday worship, I don't believe those who worship God should give much credence to those who put the traditions of men above the Law of God.|`|3KKn8RrWaa	Yeah, its a good one... since I use it every day and I don't need them..challanging.. but its too late lol|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	I see no problem with this.

I'm an atheist due to the fact that loads of people end up having arguments over religions when its all lies init?<br>  how can a human being change water into wine?<br>  how can a virgin give birth to a baby?<br>  how can an individual create the earth in 7 days?<br>  obviously earth happened due to space reasons or whatever.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	My opinion on these things -- NICE!  fairly modern and progressive of the Church.  It is JUST a suggestion.. so as always WHAT to give up for lent is STILL up to the person. <br>  <br>  I doubt many Catholics will even hear about this and even fewer will actually give up texting. MOST Catholics who hear about this will think texting is "essential" part of their job or "the only way" they can communicate with family.  So most will think they are the exception to this request.<br>  <br>  That's what I think.  I doubt many priests will even mention this in their churches. <br>  <br>  BUT.. personally,  I don't text at all.. so that wouldn't be giving up anything for me.<br>  AND I don't throw gum on the street and already recycle alot...again... not things that are really "sacrifices" for me to do.<br>  <br>  This sums it up nicely...<br>  ""What does giving up mean? If the use is capricious, then abstinence is welcome, but if technology is needed for work it makes no sense," said the Rev. Giancarlo Angelo Andreis, a priest at a Rome basilica.<br>  <br>  "I have to decide how to experience the Lent period. I should give up something if I really feel it, not because the Church says so," said 26-year-old Angelo Dente."|`|casg30Ataa	Stupid.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	meaningless
EZ5mwUF3aa	It would be very annoying. People are so dang self centered these days, everything revolves around THEM.<br>  The more I know people the more I love my dogs...|`|WXExyAlWaa	Yes. In confined public places you should be considerate to those around you - if you must talk on a phone, try to speak quietly. If the other person cannot hear you, maybe it's not a good place to talk, especially if the conversation is unimportant. You should say "Sorry, it's hard to hear you - can I call you back?"<br>  <br>  I can't stand people who yell and fuss around in buses. I'm really sensitive to sudden and loud noises, it's one of the triggers for my anxiety.|`|WuhIoS1laa	There are Amtrak trains that have phone-free cars to avoid these people.<br>  <br>  Is it that she was yakking on the cell phone that bothered you, or the fact that her conversation was loud? <br>  <br>  In public, I think having loud obnoxious conversations rude. So even if Mrs. Loud had Mr. Loud right in the seat next to her it would still have been awful. <br>  <br>  Maybe the bus engine made it hard for her to hear or be understood? In any case she could have saved her loud life story for when she didn't have a captive audience.|`|Yi7AR18qaa	The woman your talking about doesn't seem to care about who hears what she's saying or others around her.

In the UK we have dedicated "phone free" carriages on trains for precisely this reason.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do if you get a call on a bus or train is to tell the person calling you're on a bus/train and will call them back.|`|xCifmFfkaa	That is the worst!

Firstly, i am a very middle class person.  I feel threatened by them because i expect them to be aggressive towards me.  If i felt the same about blacks, i would rightly be considered racist.  On the other hand, it would probably be hard to find common ground with them.  My sister and her children could easily be described as chavs, and we get on fine.  I sort of feel that the idea of the chav is a form of snobbery.

nEc0L0MRaa	Internet role playing is a game, and there is nothing wrong with games, they are an escape from reality, and allow us to use our imagination.  Live action role playing is also a fun activity, it's not like people think they have transformed into fairies or ancient knights.  It's a game of imagination, an activation of a part of the human mind that we do not use much in today's world.  There is nothing wrong with using your mind.  These games can also teach you a lot about yourself, you can be anyone in the game, and it helps a person to identify their dreams, who they want to be in real life.|`|MSST8jNlaa	In my opinion, the dragons shouldn't be able to easily transform back into humans.

It may sound cranky, but that's how things are - many things today are about faking things. The Net is a strong medium for this, and trough it we fake relationships, events, human interaction and what not. RPs are just a prelude to this - a virtual, parallel reality that, like other 'fake' realities, can help us express ourselves, but can also distract and drive us away from the real world. I have nothing against it, but I seriously think that it should be approached with some caution and viewed strictly as a form of entertainment (which includes not spending too much time per day or week in such an activity - 1.5 to 2 hours max).|`|4S5NnT7aaa	On the basis of people I know who've been into this stuff, I'd say it's good as a social activity, but only where the people involved have other things in their lives.  <br>  <br>  It's too easy for those who are shy, lack social skills, or have low self esteem to end up obsessed with and living through the rp games.

He's met every girlfriend he's had through either the LARP or friends from LARP. His roommate, now that he's graduated and taking care of himself, is someone from the LARP. Another friend from the LARP *gave* him a working car which needed about $65 worth of work to run well, largely because the guy knew my son through the LARP and thought he'd use it well while becoming the game master or whatever it's called.<br>  <br>  Is it sometimes silly? Sure. But I'd consider the friendships forged and the favors they do for one another worth the time. It sure beats getting sh!tface drunk three nights a week, like many guys his age were doing while he was in the game.

Apollo was worshipped in both ancient Greek and Roman religion, as well as in the modern Hellenic neopaganism.<br>  <br>  As the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god — the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Medicine and healing were associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius. Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague as well as one who had the ability to cure. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks. As the leader of the Muses (Apollon Musagetes) and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry. Hermes created the lyre for him, and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo. Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans.<br>  <br>  In Hellenistic times, especially during the third century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, god of the sun, and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene, goddess of the moon.[1] In Latin texts, however, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the first century, not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII (161-215).[2] Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the third century|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	Basically the God of Sun and beauty.

4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	As I've said elsewhere:<br>  <br>  Everything comes from somewhere, in my opinion... But I don't think Traditional Vampires (the kind you see in most books and movies) exist as they are portrayed, if at all. Maybe they do or did at some point, I don't think anyone can know for sure, but even if it were so then I doubt you're going to find any. I would think that a being like that relies on keeping its existence secret.<br>  <br>  Either way, there are Modern Vampires, which would be people that need to feed off others in order to stay healthy and/or feel good. They for sure exist, and can be anyone. :] I've been around the community for about five or six years now, and there's all sorts of people there... good and not-so-good.

It is not something that God requires or demands of Christians. At the same time, the Bible presents fasting as something that is good, profitable, and expected. The Book of Acts records believers fasting before they made important decisions (Acts 13:4; 14:23). Fasting and prayer are often linked together (Luke 2:37; 5:33). Too often, the focus of fasting is on the lack of food. Instead, the purpose of fasting should be to take your eyes off the things of this world, and instead focus on God. Fasting is a way to demonstrate to God, and to yourself, that you are serious about your relationship with Him. Fasting helps you to gain a new perspective and a renewed reliance upon God.<br>  <br>  Although fasting in Scripture is almost always a fasting from food, there are other ways to fast. Anything you can temporarily give up in order to better focus on God can be considered a fast (1 Corinthians 7:1-5). Fasting should be limited to a set time, especially when the fasting is from food. Extended periods of time without eating can be harmful to the body. Fasting is not intended to punish your flesh, but to focus on God. Fasting should not be considered a “dieting method” either. A biblical fast is not to lose weight, but rather to gain deeper fellowship with God. Anyone can fast, but some may not be able to fast from food (diabetics for example), but everyone can temporarily give up something in order to focus on God.<br>  <br>  By taking our eyes off the things of this world, we can focus better on Christ. Fasting is not a way to get God to do what we want. Fasting changes us, not God. Fasting is not a way to appear more spiritual than others. Fasting is to be done in a spirit of humility and a joyful attitude. Matthew 6:16-18 declares, “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”|`|gSxYuDEEaa	Isaiah 56 is a good scripture.  it deals with the true meaning of fasting, not being just a day set aside for it.

This is probably an influence of European magic though. <br>  <br>  As I was taught:<br>  <br>  3 to do something good.<br>  7 for luck.<br>  9 for control, power or influence.<br>  13 for ending a condition.<br>  <br>  Additionally, there is the concept of Lucky Dream Numbers (that is, a notion that dreams correspond to certain numbers which will be lucky the next day.) This might be another European infiltration, however -- hoodoo is kind of a melting pot of cultural traditions from all over.|`|866c0414bd793093e0ef8a379814398faa	Voodoo is generally not referred to as a religion.
