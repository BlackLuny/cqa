AA11123536	Do you mean spayed?  I have never heard of that particular problem, but many older females have hormonal issues after they are spayed, particularly if they have had kittens before.  It will probably go away after a week or so, but give your vet a call to be on the safe side.|`|59de5e4ccfa3bdfca51c41e4aa7cc42baa	okeay, dont ask these q's ok thats disguisting!|`|AA12133338	wait.

I think the best thing you could do is call your vet and ask if this is normal. You will want to do so as soon as possible. Because it could be a sign of another problem with you cat or it could just be a small reaction to the spaying. The cat could have a slight infection , so you best bet is to call the vet and see what they have to say.|`|AA10022566	Depends, I assume if you sprayed her with toxic waste that might happen.    If you just got your cat spayed, you might want to take her to the vet.  That never happened with my cats, so I don't think its normal.

Here are some things to help make the process easier-    Taming Dos  Establish a routine where your hamster will know that you are feeding and playing with it. It may even look forward to the next play time!     Small treats given to your hamster after playing with it will help your hamster gain confidence in you and know that you mean no harm.     Talk/whistle to your hamster and they may learn to recognise your voice.   --------------------------------------...    Taming Don'ts   Never pick up your hamster when it is still sleeping. You will most likely get your fingers bitten by a crossed hamster. It is best to handle your hamster when it is awake at night.     Make sure your fingers do not smell of food or your hamster may accidentally nip it, mistaking it for food.     Upon alerting your hamster of your presence (by tapping softly on the cage, for e.g.), give it enough time to investigate your presence.     Do not blow or breathe heavily on the hamster.     A sure sign that a hamster is annoyed will be that its ears are curled and laid back. Do not handle the hamster when this happens.   --------------------------------------...    Also, try letting him climb into a glass, or a plastic ball. Then sit in the bathtub (make sure the drain is closed) and let him run around on your lap. He will feel more secure. Hope this helps!

AA11832876	You should get a small dog and since your yard isn't fenced I would fence in a area off your back door or a door you don't use. if you get a dog that isn't a jumper or a digger then you could just get some stakes and wire (chicken wire or what ever else kind of wire). We did that when I had my poodles they got so used to running because we lived in the country then when I moved to town with my boyfriend we had little money but had to do something we so we bought some stakes and some chicken wire and made them a nice little pin off of the back door.

6b3980d5c1de92bd94ae26661494ec50aa	Well I would say what your problem here is that your dog just really loves you. I have seen lots of dogs that act in the same way. They have grown so attached to you that they become sad when you leave. I really don't know what you could really do about this. The only suggestion I have would be, take him with you when you can. But then you risk that when there are times that you can't take him, the barking and howling would be worse. If you are lucky it will pass once he realizes that yes you are coming back.|`|29bb14baa190097af6e2e1fac9ccebe1aa	Make an appt for him at the vet to discuss seperation anxiety- there is a medication out there called clomicalm, and it works wonders...Besides the howling, is he displaying destructive behavior?

8bTder08aa	For the 19-year-old:      Make the decision NOW as to how much money you are willing to pay for vet bills if he develops a serious problem.  If you realistically know how much you can/will pay, it makes dealing with emergencies a lot easier.  Re-visit this decision periodically as your horse gets older.     Decide what is the minimal quality of life you are willing to accept for your horse:  how much discomfort/disability are you going to allow before you feel that euthanasia is justified?     These are issues I had to deal with as my horse went downhill the last year of his life (he had to be euthanized at 23 when he developed acute laminitis).  It is helpful to have at least given them some thought before the need to act on them arises.    Also, have a plan for what you will do if the 19-year-old becomes unrideable.  A retirement home, if you will.      For the younger horse, it sounds like you're doing fine.  Just make sure you have an adequate emergency vet fund in case something comes up.    Good luck!|`|96O8OAtDaa	Excellent job on your part!  Lucky horses to have an owner like you, who truly cares about them.  You're doing everything that you can do on your end.  Keep up the good work!!|`|XL62syrCaa	You are doing a great job. And I agree with above by saying they will be happier outside. Horses that are happier tend to live longer.    Just keep monitoring them and keeping up their health and they will live a long life. I hope they make it to 40, BUT if they don't you can be assured that it wasn't because of miss care or abuse or anything you did (or didn't do). You are doing the right thing :)|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	Sounds like you're giving them your best.  They're very fortunate to have such good care.|`|8cikAYp3aa	your doing fine with what you have already.  Being out and in a run in is the best thing for them.  Horses arnt ment to stand still in a box 18 hours a day.    I've kept horse outside, with a run in for years and other then the sun will fade thier coats a tad in summer, and they get shaggy in winter there is no other "ill" effects.  if you can call that a Ill effect.  make sure they have plenty of hay, fresh water in winter.  Make sure the pasture is grass they will eat and not green weeds they wont eat in summer.  I put up Airwick automatic sprayers ( you buy them at walmart for home air freshening) they will hold the bottles of aerosol fly spray and give a puff every 20 mins.   theres one in the run in and one out in the field nailed to their favorite loafing tree in the summer.    Just use common sense and they will do fine for a very long time.|`|HjcT7ngKaa	ur doing the best u can  them- which is great!!!  TLC is all u need lolll for them  keep it up and expect  a long happy life 4 ur QH's!!|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Keep up what you are doing, which sounds very good.  The other thing that contributes a great deal to health and longevity in horses is being out 24/7 with a run in shelter, so they get as much exercise as possible all day and night, if you can provide that, and hay free choice all winter.    EDIT....in that case, they should live to be at least 75 !!!!
3sB49YNnaa	They probably are not nursing much if any at this stage.  The sow may have already weaned them (ie stopped letting them nurse).  In any case, to wean them, all you need to do is take the pups and put them in another cage or cages.  This is the point to separate the baby boars from the baby  sows into separate cages.  You probably want to separate the pups from the sow in the morning since they will squawk for a while and if you do it at night they will keep you awake with their complaints!|`|goCkjhDzaa	Their mother will actually wean them herself when she feels both she and them are ready for it|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Guinea pigs are generally weaned at three weeks. This is VITAL for the male pups - males can be sexually active as young as 3 weeks old and can impregnate their mother.    Please remove any male pups immediately. Female pups can stay with their mother another week if you want, but it is not necessary.    How to wean? This is easy - the pups will already be eating solids, and little to no milk. Just get at least one extra cage - remove all male pups and house them together. You can either put the females in a separate cage, or leave them with mum.    Just make sure they are all getting a good diet (quality pellets, unlimited grass hay and a variety of fresh veggies daily. The pups can also have some alfalfa hay (or alfalfa based pellets) for the extra calcium, until they are 6 months.|`|XDCLL4Oqaa	take them away now. The girls can stay though the boys cannot. They will get others pregnant.
vV425TqZaa	They are correct, Romain lettuce has no nutritional value but it is the most popular green because it is almost all water and it will hydrate your dragon. Now a diet of only crickets is just fine but you still want greens in the tank, it is always good to mix up a small verity of greens. no other insects have to be added my male and female are over just about 2 and i have always fed them crickets and mixed greens in their enclosure. Considering that Romain lettuce has no nutritional value, most dragons wont drink from their water bowls so when you feed your bearded dragon lettuce, drench it in water before placing it near them, this will hydrate them a bit more.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Romane lettuce does not provide any nutrition for them,but if you are dusting it then you can feed it.You would be better off feeding swiss chard or kale for the greens.If you did this them you could get away with dusting only your crickets.As far as feeding other bugs they do like the variet and just a lil piece of info for you too.They love pinkies ya know baby mice.Well hope i helped,and i hope you enjoy your lil buddy as much as i enjoy my set:)|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Crickets are fine but throw away the lettuce. No nutritional value in it at all and it should not have a lot of carrots either. For his salads you should be giving him chicory greens, collard greens, dandelion greens mustard greens or turnip greens and for his veggies acorn and butternut squash are great as well as sweet potato, green beans , okra, parsnip and peas. Also on the list are asparagus, beets, bell peppers, broccoli, celery leaves, rutabaga, turnips, spaghetti squash, kale, carrot tops, bok choy, beet greens, yellow squash, zucchini and for fruits try apples, bananas, blackberries, cantaloupe, seedless grapes and peeled, honeydew melon, kiwi, pears, peaches, raspberries, and strawberries.You do need to vary his diet a bit. Just think about yourself. Would you be happy eating the same thing every day? Super worms are really easy to keep and care for and good for your dragon. But then so are phoenix worms and a few wax worms as a treat.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Yes, just crickets is OK. Your dragon will enjoy any kind of worm too, but it gets all the nutrition it needs from dusted crickets.    The greens are more for digestion and water than nutritional value, but I'd suggest a little more variety than what you're providing. The list of greens you included in your question are all excellent for a dragon. You're also using the right kind of lettuce. You don't need to dust the lettuce if you're doing so to the crickets. The dragon doesn't need that many vitamins.|`|wZKb8egaaa	Crickets are fine, they are the best thing you can give them. Give it the worms as treats only.  Romaine lettuce IS mostly water. Carrots don't allow them to absorb the vitamin D3 and it can cause impaction. Cabbage is bad (I can't remember what it dose but I have never heard anything good about it).  Now, the greens are good (collard, mustard, dandilion, and turnip) they need these with every meal and they will eat more once it becomes an adult.  Green beans are fine as a treat but not as a main diet.   You can see if it'll eat some fruit and if so give it to your BD as a treat.  And . . . yeah, that's it for basics, you need to do some research.  Good luck!

Good luck|`|FfNKLG7Gaa	I don't wanna be mean, but you can try hitting her under her chin, that's what some dog trainers do. Other than that, look mad and say no!|`|a265b90896253928072bd13daee52b80aa	SAY NO!  And ignore her.  She'll get the point.  The more you let her do it then more she is going to!|`|c47867f2c180b4c92561d865aadf3814aa	Thats cute. She just wants to play. When my cockapoo jumps on the couch he just wants to play. And if you fall for the sad eyes your dog will think of you as a pushover and thats not good because YOU are the master.|`|a2f6fbaa5e06f9286f54b3ddc7642f36aa	Thats pretty cute =)... when she licks you will have to hold her mussle and say no licking... she does it again keep on it! BE PERSISTANT! as for the jumping up on the keyboard, she is just wanting attention... do you let her jump on your lap when you arent on the computer? if you do then you are giving her a mixed signal and she doesnt quite understand that she cant jump on you when you are on the computer.... so put her somewhere while you are typing or get her busy with something else like chewing on a bone or playing with a favorite toy!... I hope this was helpful!!!
r0u26SYGaa	ok, so all you need to do is see if there is anything inside the missing legs, if you see them. if they are empty and hollow, he is doing an outer molt,and im sure you know what a molt is, so when they outer molt, they loose all their legs and body ( and eyes. )  then they are inside the shell and you don't see them, then ( if he is a medium size,) in around a few weeks, he will come out, and eat his old skin. make sure that no other hermit eats the skin or he will die for sure. if the legs aren't hollow, hope for the best, how many legs did he loose? you are only supposed to see 4 legs and 2 pincher's. if he lost 2 legs or less he'll be ok, if it was more, sorry, im not sure if he'll live. if he lost 2 or less, try taking him by the shell and blowing hot air on him. does he have painted shells in the tank? if he does, please take them away cause paint kills hermit crabs, and if your hermit crabs are waring painted shells, make sure you have only natural ones to choose from. if your hermit crabs have painted shells right now, when they change their shell, take the painted one they had before away, so their will be only natural ones left! good luck!|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	This many be stupid question from someone that has been caring for hermit crabs for 5 years.    Are you sure he is not molting?    -rds|`|B9dluSbpaa	get a new hermit crab,  and if you have other crabs, make sure they haven't been eating off of him...|`|hCyt28Meaa	I would put him in a separate tank, and hope for the best, in the mean time, clean his old tank, and make sure your other crabs, if you have any haven't eaten off of him and caught a possible disease. Hope for the best, Good luck =]
YhH0PNupaa	It is a great possibility. The candling the other person mentioned will only work if then hen has started sitting on the eggs. If it is fertilized, it will have a large white spot on the yolk, all eggs will have a small white spot.   http://www.backyardchickens.com/forum/vi... Take a look at that link, it has pictures. But you can still eat a fertilized egg. It won't hurt you. I eat them all the time.|`|M9KUiTOAaa	When did they hatch? You could try candling them. Go into a dark room with a flashlight and shine it up from underneath it. If you see veins then the egg is fertilized. But the eggs must be at least 5 days old to tell this.  try going to this web site:  geocities.com/heatland/bluff/1958/  eggs.html   It will give you all the info you need.
NBfBKI1Uaa	Best thing is a buy few Styrofoam buckets and battery operated air pumps for each of them. Empty the tank and put the fish in the buckets along with the pieces of filter media (if you have more than one) in and put an air hose using the battery operated air pump. And close the lid tightly. Don't worry about oxygen since it is not going to be air tight lid. But if you are paranoid you could drill a few small holes.    The problem would be space. Do you have enough space in your car for all the buckets.     The fishes will easily survive a couple of days in this manner.     -rds|`|H06PtiIAaa	im actually doing the same, well im going from NY to FLA    what im am doing is moving my aquariums in a moving truck, the aquarium only no fish or plants.     my fish are being transported in my audi in coolers and styro boxes. this is about a 24 hour trip, i do professionally bag them with the help a loc al fish store.    My corals which have to be in light are flying in the air plane with me so we can put them under light again within 6 hours max.      Really a trash can a plastic one that has a plastic liner can hold your fish. your actually lucky as freshwater is rather easy as saltwater we have to worry about more and corals etc... i would drive it, yea it is a pain, but for your boy it will be worth it.|`|hCyt28Meaa	You could ship them if you wanted too, it would cost a little bit to buy the mini heaters for them, but it wouldn't be out of the question. You could also sell them and then use the money to buy new fish when you get there. But it's definitely not out of the question that you could transport them. I would place them in a cooler, or you could bag them, in big heavy duty bags, or buy a few cheap 10 gallon tanks for like $10 each and then put styrafoam around them so they won't crack on the trip. I wish you the best of luck, happy fish-keeping =]|`|0JlOaYIIaa	I have ordered koi from Japan for my pond.

fjkRIUSnaa	dunno maybe she how do i say this just want some booty.. or maybe thats her way of introducing her self i dunno|`|MLC97M1Baa	Dominance. It is very common in females and males who have been fixed, do not worry. It is just a way of asserting dominance over another canine.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	sounds like a sign of submissivness.|`|TlKtREYgaa	she may be coming into heat soon.. my yorkie female does that all the time especially right before a heat or right after|`|joBYl8vHaa	She is asserting her dominance. She is telling the other dogs to respect her. Wolves, coyotes, foxes, etc, all do this behavior. In the wild, higher ranking wolves will hit the lower wolf with their butt to keep them in line. If you can find some videos about pack behavior in wild dogs, im sure you will see them do this to each other. I would guess that your dog is not shy or submissive around other dogs? Your dog is acting totally normal.
TpOVmqpHaa	Although she could be finished, 3 pups is quite a small litter for a shepherd.  My females have frequently taken a 3-4 hour break mid whelping.  They take their time, having a pup or two every 45-60 minutes. Then they stop about half way through....like mother nature's giving them a bit of a rest before delivering the other half of the litter.  As long as I don't see hard contractions or pushing, I don't worry.    If she still has pups in the womb you should be able to feel them, possibly even feel/see them moving.  If you think you do feel more pups and she doesn't go back into labor soon...give the emergency vet a call.  They'll ask you more detailed questions and determine whether you should bring her in or just let her be.   This is why breeders keep oxytocin on hand...to give a 'cleanout' shot if they suspect there are any retained pups or placentae|`|PM23RDycaa	*sighs* why do people breed without knowing anything BEFOREHAND    Call an after hours vet and talk to them.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Why on earth are you on here asking, you should have done TONS upon TONS of research before your dog went into labor. Call your vet, do not post online when you do not know whether the answer is valid or not. You could end up injuring the dog and her pups.|`|om4Szik7aa	Oh everyone calm down! She may know what she is doing and is just panicky...also, if she is a beginner, you have to stare somewhere. She can't be expected to know everything immediately. She clearly cares enough to ask in here, and I think she will make a good decision.     Go with what the first woman responded. She sounds like she knows what she is doing. Good luck with your babies!!|`|DTiiM0zLaa	Experienced breeders always have shots of pitossin on hand for labors which are taking too long.

V8rV38yfaa	Any day better, if you get breeds like the persian and siamese you'll have a great time together and a lot of affection.    Unfortunately people think dogs are more affectionate as they can only afford to buy a dog and not a cat.    But cats are anyday more affectionate.    If you can't afford a cat, get one from the shelters but get a cat.    Because in the end of the day the dog may just bite you where as cats may claw but that can be solved by various methods.    99% Cats do not claw.    Where as 13% Dogs do not bite.    Go For Cats !|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i think both cats and dogs can be really good companions|`|LBfOsZN5aa	Well..... My dog is crazy and loving, and my cat is calm and devoted.

They have pure breed rescues and mixed breed rescues. Too many dogs are breed and so many - esp labs are being killed in shelters everyday. Hundreds of puppies are gassed in shelters because there are not enough homes. If you adopt from a rescue you save a life. Also they know the personality of the dog and if it would suit you best. Not all dogs, though the same breed are alike. Also if it doesn't work out for you, the rescue group will always take back an animal and you will not be forced to give it up to a city/county shelter where usually all owner turn ins are the 1st to be destroyed. You can find more info on this on the web.|`|r6a9b3V8aa	The labs are very nice and friendly and love to swim. My neighbors have one, and she is so sweet.

(it's happened alot)Just be sure to keep the lab inside or in a fenced yard when you leave.|`|firHlIBLaa	Description:  There are two types of Labradors, the English Labrador and the American Labrador. The English bred lab comes from English bred stock. Their general appearance is different. The English bred labs are heavier, thicker and blockier. The American bred Lab comes from American bred stock and is tall and lanky. The Labrador Retriever is a solid, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a short, hard, easy-care, water-resistant double coat that does not have any waves and comes in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. There is also said to be a rare silver or gray color that is referred to by the AKC as a shade of chocolate. This color is controversial and some claim it is a Weimeriner cross, while others say it is a true mutation. The Labrador has a broad head, thick nose, scissors bite and a pronounced stop. Its muzzle is fairly wide and its neck is powerful. The eyes are chestnut or hazel with an intelligent expression. The medium-sized ears are pendant. The otter tail is strong, thick near the body then tapering, and completely covered with hair. Its limbs have good bone structure. The webbed feet aid in swimming.    Temparament:  The Labrador Retriever is a loving, affectionate, lovable, patient dog. Highly intelligent, loyal, willing, and high-spirited. Lively and good-natured, they love to play, especially in water - for they love to swim. They have an excellent, reliable, temperament and are friendly, superb with children and equable with other dogs. They crave human attention and need to feel as though they are part of the family. Labs are easily trained. Some may be reserved with strangers unless very well socialized as puppies. These dogs are watchdogs, not guard dogs, although some have been known to guard. They can become destructive if left too much to their own devices. Train Labradors early not to pull on the leash, as they have very strong necks. Show lines are generally heavier and easier going than field lines. Field lines tend to be very energetic and high strung. Often the best pets are from combination show/field stock. This breed is very popular. If you are planning to show, buy only from a reputable breeder. Labs are a bit more dominant and independent than the Golden Retriever. Some of their talents include: hunting, tracking, retrieving, watchdogging, police work, narcotics detection, guide for the blind, service dog for the disabled, search and rescue, sledding, carting, agility, and competitive obedience. Labs bred from English lines (English Labs) are more calm and laid back than Labradors bred from American lines. English Labs mature quicker than the American type.     Height:   Dogs 22-24 inches (56-61cm.)   Bitches 21-23 inches (53-58cm.)    Weight:   Dogs 60-75 pounds (27-34kg.)   Bitches 55-70 pounds (25-32kg.)   Some males can grow to 100 pounds (45kg) or more.        Health Problems:  Prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, PRA and eye disorders.    Living Conditions:  Labrador Retrievers will do okay in an apartment if sufficiently exercised. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard.    Exercise:  Labrador Retrievers will do okay in an apartment if sufficiently exercised. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard.      Life expectancy:  About 10-12 years       Grooming:  The smooth, short-haired, double coat is easy to groom. Comb and brush regularly with a firm, bristle brush, paying attention to the undercoat. Bathe or dry shampoo only when necessary. These dogs are average shedders.         You might want to check some other sources too.  And if you want to watch a video clip on Labs: http://animal.discovery.com/beyond/index...   (Labs can be found under the sporting dogs category).    Hope I could help. All the best with your dog.|`|fO9Aye3caa	Hey great, lovely dogs but they do need a lot of work and attention, you must be prepared for long walks in all weathers and be able to spend time with it. They are very intelligent, which is why they are used as guide dogs so will need to kept mentally active as well, check out the following.    www.goldenretriever-dog.com    www.dogbreedinfo.com/goldenretriever.h...     www.goldenretrievers.co.uk    www.canismajor.com/dog/labrador.html     dogs.about.com/cs/breedprofiles/p/labr...       Good luck and enjoy your new friend.|`|35a01c488c521beb432dc52893dd0146aa	What you need to do is research the breed and just learn how to care for dogs.  Go the link in my source list and take all the Puppy University courses.  They're interactive tutorials that are great for learning how to care for a puppy (or even an adult dog, for that matter).    As for Labrador retrievers, they are big, powerful dogs that should be trained while they're still young before they get out of hand.  They should have lots of socializing by letting them meet lots of new people and animals, and by taking them to lots of new places.  This will help the dog not to be suspicious, defensive, or timid.  A well-socialized, well-trained Labrador retriever is a friendly, eager-to-please dog that will get along with anyone.  They should be trained to walk well on a leash at an early age, since they have a very strong neck and will pull you down the street if they're not trained to do otherwise.    They love the water, and need a LOT of exercise!  They tend to act like destructive puppies for a long time, until they're about 3 years old, so you have to make sure you can tolerate this.  A good thing to do with your lab is teach it to fetch.  They can go on fetching balls and sticks for a long time, and it's especially fun if you're throwing it in the water for them.    Of course, your lab will also need regular vet work, like any dog.  Take him to the vet for a check-up as soon as you get him (or her), and he'll get dewormed and get his first vaccinations.  You'll have to go to the vet again every few weeks for more vaccinations, and then again when he's about 4 months old to get him neutered (or spayed).  After his first year, he'll just need annual check-ups and vaccinations once a year.    Research is the best thing you can do, especially if you plan on training the dog yourself.  An excellent thing to do with a puppy is take it to Puppy Kindergarten classes.  These are great for socialization, and they help teach you to train the dog.|`|2K6MEL9Naa	lab retrievers are very nice pets, if you train it well, they are friendly and energetic|`|be7fa0634428c392bea013827c4cd1deaa	don't get a chocolate one they are useless when they lie in the sun or by the fire they melt! ;-)|`|4078e8b3863cb3f6fe2c8b53b086c6e4aa	I have a black lab.retriever.  They are v. nice, friendly, intelligent dogs, but I can confirm that they pull like a train if not properly trained, love the water and take a long time to dry once wet, and chew everything in sight for the first 2-3 years!    Worth the effort though.    From experience of other dogs we meet in the park, the black ones seem quickest to learn sense, the chocolate ones never grow out of being a puppy and the golden ones are totally blonde - cute but dumb.    Enjoy your dog when you get one
EKg97zZlaa	yes they are nutritious and delicious haha  but um they will be good but just before you give the guppies to the convicts feed the guppies a healthy variety of food so your convicts will get extra nutrients from them.    but you will also need to feed the convicts some food other than guppies (mainly food with lots of vegetables cus they can't get their veggies from the guppies ! =D)    have a fun time with your fish!

wc9viY4Saa	I'm assuming up to a year or more...There's a lot more that needs to be taught before you can jump a horse, like how to groom it, feed it, clean up after it, saddle it etc...They want to make sure you will not kill yourself on the horse, or by the horse. You need to learn ALL basics and be comfortable with those basics before moving onto the next level. Each level will take a while because a horse is a powerful creature and you need to know and respect all aspects of this beautiful creature.|`|9JXv4tceaa	It will take at least a year. You need to become good at all the basics like walk trot canter and you diagonals and leads. It might sound easy but when you are on the horse it is very hard. It took me over two years before i learned how to jump. You also need to learn as much as you can about the horse when you are dismounted. Like the names of all the parts of the body, the names of all the tack and all the the pieces of tack, the horses behavior, how to act around a horse, all the things it takes to have a horse, what a horse needs to be healthy, and more. Riding can be very dangerous and you need to be sure that you know what you are doing before you jump. My advice is maybe take two lessons a week. I did and it helped me a lot!!!    Good luck and have fun!|`|8f2703ece647b367ecdfbc82a21c3b13aa	If varies from person to person. It all depends on how much you learn and how fast you learn it. I can also depend on your personal level of confidence. I remember when my trainer was getting me to start to jump I was dead scared. It only took me a couple lessons to figure out how much fun jumping was, but it took me about two years to get into stage of jumping. I know its longer then most people but I had a bad horse accident in the middle of it.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	It's gonna be awhile.    First you gotta learn how to ride.......jumping comes later.    I would say you are looking at atleast  a year

And a parrot covers both a budgerigar and a macaw, one of which is of much superior intelligence and can be taught a lot more.    2. Ease of training has a lot to do with "understanding" the animal in question, they all have variable psychology, and training will depend on understanding the species you are working with. For example, pack instinct in dogs, the flight instinct in a horse, or the failure of a parrot to understand punishment.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	No matter if your pet is smart or whatever, you need patience with any pet. Theres not certain breed. It all depends on your dogs personality. It could be a lab and be lazy while a lot of labs are active. It could be a shihtzu and be so active when most just love staying on the couch. Explain the trick, show them how to do it, and make hand motions like directions on how they do it.|`|9O6uEGPoaa	there is a new implant available on the black market allowing you to control any animal. its simple cheap and very easy to control.

With this certain kind of dogs it is very hard to decide. But here are a few suggestions. Another thing is to  bring your puppy home, and find out her personality, play with her, and then you can see if any names fit her. Or you could buy a baby book, and look at names there. That way you can pick out certain things you want the name to have and look those up!  1. Sasha  2. Katy   3. Carly  4. Bobby (can be a girls name)  5. Sam or Samantha  6. Lucy   Hope I helped! Good luck with your darling puppy!|`|fpuPRNlWaa	I suggest Blueberry.|`|xXa3eQOeaa	She's adorable!!  I can't begin to name her. Listen for a name that reflects her personality.

8K8yIRLXaa	Even though the scissors were blunted, its really easy to cut the skin directly under the mat, even if you don't poke her directly with the end of the scissors.     The easiest way to remove mats is to clip them off with motorized clippers, like they use to cut people hair. You won't cut her skin that way.     Is she a long haired cat? Some cats don't groom themselves well and need to be brushed on a regular basis.     Keep in mind as you talk about winning her love back, that cats are by nature solitary creatures. When someone talks about being the boss with cats, they don't understand cat behavior. You probably startled her when you were trying to cut the mats off. Give her some time to relax, but at the same time, you want to remind her that spending time with you is a good thing. Does she like being petted or brushed? When she comes to you, do things that she likes such as brushing her or playing with her. Picking her up and holding her against her will or trying to put her on the bed when she doesn't want to be there is just going to make her more skittish.     Just give her some time and she'll remember that you're a good thing, not a bad thing and she'll come around.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	You are the boss!...she needs to learn now. put her on your lap feet facing you and make her stay there.  YOU are the boss.  Do it now for grooming sake or you will always have a problem.|`|jzex4ncSaa	Hi, I've never been here before, in this category I mean.    I'm sorry I can't give any answer, I just past by and saw your avatar, I am male and I have to say YOUR AVATAR IS FREAKIN' CUTE! She's so beautiful, very very cute    LOL may i have the pic..? Please don't delete my answer guys    thanks|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	My one cat has had mats for years. I can easily pull them out by this method. I take the mat and work it with my fingers almost like into a twine. I pull from the bottom quickly, and she barely flitches. Use your thumb and index finger. She should forget about the scissor incident. Worst thing about using scissors', is that they dont pull out the root. My method does. Let me know if i can be of more help.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Well have someone hold her down while you cut the matted fur.  Hold her paws or something  She'll forgive you.. don't worry she will.  I have about 30 cats on a farm and they all get love and attention and forgive me if I ever have to cute the long haired ones fur.  Believe me almost ALL cats HATE scissors.|`|kNhYFgCTaa	dont worry about it and just continue to be playful with her.    she will come around eventually. cats can be afraid of weird objects like scissors lol. best to not show them anything too foreign to their eyes. especially something intimidating like scissors haha.     try playing with her. be patient.|`|POzCKBzvaa	As far as your cat feeling comfortable around you again I would just let her come to you. Don't try to force it.  I rescued a cat from an alleyway behind my work about a year and a half ago. She took a very long time to be even slightly normal around me. I'm still the only person she will let pet her. She still won't let me pick her up, she still runs from me at the slightest little spook. I expect she'll always be this way to some extent.  I always was just there for her if she wanted to come near me or let me pet her. I never tried to go after her to in a sense "teach" her that I was OK. She just doesn't work that way.   Good luck!
wjwsFPMuaa	I can picture that exact run right now. And it's hilarious. All kittens do that! They kind of hop too..back slightly arched..fur puffed out. He's just playing. Nothing to worry about.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	No, he's not normal, because he's away from his mom and littermates two weeks too early.    Darksong~|`|LM7DWcdlaa	He is probably using lots of energy and hasn't been able to gain full balance yet. My kitten did that too. if there are no other symptoms, hes healthy.|`|57fZyjvgaa	A 6 week old kitten shouldn't even react to catnip.   It sounds like a neurological disorder.    edit: what the people below me are saying is true - he could be playing! have you owned cats before? would you know if he is just playing or if something is wrong?  Just keep an eye on him and note when and why he does his little sideways jumps... it he's playing then you have nothing to worry about, if it seems to make him stumble, then try a few balance tests with him.|`|AA10323497	it may be 'play posturing' ----my kitten does it only when she is very very excited
nPdKJyK4aa	Awww thats so cute!!! i want to know how you trained him to do that!!!! LOL. anyways good job on doing whats right for your baby!!! He should have unlimited timothy hay, unlimited pellets, i like the guinea pig vitamin C drops that i put in his water daily, and he should be getting about 1-1 1/2cups of fresh veggies everyday. i have a massive list of fresh fruits and veggies they can and cant eat. Are you absolutely sure that the dandelion leaves you are feeding him dont have any pesticides, fungicides, weed killers, fertilizers, animal droppings, or pollution from rain water on them??? Those thing can even run off a neighbors yard or off the street onto your yard as well!!! heres a great guinea pig forum where my massive list is and many many other guinea pig related info!!! hope this helps and i hope to see you there!!!    http://www.cavygalore.proboards.com/inde...|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	first of all keep communications up with your vet and ask to have his weight checked in a few days. most vets will charge nothing for weight checks. good you took him pneumonia is deadly to humans as well as animals.     First of all this is the first person i have seen using a whole foods diet properly. FANTASTIC JOB and you are a good owner.    Try some pellet food. I have a lot of experience with Baytril with my birds. One of my birds had a leg amputated and he lost a lot too. The pellets helped him put weight back on.     Try to see if hard boiled fully cooked eggs are safe for him to have. If so let him have one chopped up once a week Make sure it only stays in his cage for 30 minutes. Any longer the bacteria grows.    You can also do lawn clippings, as long as no pesticides are used.    The one thing she needs is citrus and she needs it daily if they do not get enough vitamin C they get ill as you well know by now. Oranges are good, grapefruits are good.....Make sure to start that up right away.    Just keep in touch with the vet if you feel she has lost even more weight.    best wishes.|`|3sB49YNnaa	There is a huge difference in chows.  If you need to put weight on, you need to be feeding an 18% protein chow with vitamin C.  The chow needs to be fresh and free fed.    You also need to be careful about the quantity of greens he gets.You want to be giving him some but you don't want to over do it because to gain weight he has to be getting the protein he needs which is coming from the chow
LM7DWcdlaa	He probably feels that he needs to prove this is his territory to another. Do you have another cat, possibly male as well? If not, he probably doesnt like going in the litter box. Scold for bad behavior, praise for good...thats really all u can do.|`|wc9viY4Saa	I've been told by numerous people that even though your male cat is neutered that they can still mark their territory. I have two unneutered male cats, both 1 yr old and they haven't sprayed or marked their territories yet. They love to pee in my house plants though, but that's because it's more natural than 'kitty litter'|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	****!!! Get another litter box and place it at all corners of the house!!!
J4z3mJyuaa	While I cannot say if your cat is reaching his full ago of health, I can say that this is normal behavior of cats. I have seen many, many cats chase their tails. It is fun for him, and for you too!   He probably didn't answer you because he was really into his play. He was probably just really focused on making fast circles without tripping, and keeping his eyes on his tail. Sometimes I don't hear someone say something to me when I'm concentrating on something and humans are more intelligent than cats.   I really wouldn't worry. He probably just discovered a new way to play, or usually does it when you're not around. It's not a typical first choice of play for felines, but they do it occasionally.|`|WRAEloPdaa	Is the cycle of life...i give it another year or so!
8K8yIRLXaa	I've had really good luck and really bad luck with them. I tried them on my dad's cat and he wore them until they fell off, but nothing short of sedating him would let us put them back on. At the same time, I used them on my cat who used to scratch on the couch. He did really well with them. They lasted 2-3 months and I just replaced them as they fell off. After a while, I stopped replacing them and he had stopped scratching the couch, so I stopped using them. So it depends on the cat and how they handle them.|`|uctxzjIIaa	They do work overall, but they do tend to fall off about every 2-3 months at best, so they do still require some maintainence.|`|WRAEloPdaa	What is that??? I never heard of it..is it shampoo?|`|4l1a7nU4aa	nope they fall off. you`ll have to try them a few times. my cat chewed his off and squirmed when we put them on. hes a brat though. GOood luck!
Tu2AcKTRaa	The negatives on mice -  Mice dont tend to give any affection, they are more hard work because you have to clean up there cage every day etc.  Positives on mice -   They dont cost much.  Negatives on cats -   They are more costly with the vet bills etc.  Positives on cats -   They will provide you with affection.  They will clean up after themselfs.    If you do want to get a mouse why not get a rat ? They show more affection then mice.     My personal opinon is to get a cat .  Hope this Helped :) xx|`|AA12396342	a cat. they give affection. mice are just rodents and dont live very long.     but make sure you are willing to take proper care of it like doing your research about good food and willing to spend the money to take it to the vet if it needs it.     if not don't bother with either that would just be irresponsible pet ownership.|`|P0G1k8n6aa	cat. cats are nicer and more playful. Mice don't live very long so are harder to train.|`|D6Iv3SqBaa	you should defenitly get a cat bcuz it gives you happeness and satisfaction|`|2jJyvqMqaa	Cat. Because mice are like rodents they don't live very long.  Cats are gentle and arent dirty they live pretty long.  Your choice anyways!|`|lNfv18Bsaa	A cat: It will live longer and do more.
qPDnxTE0aa	For female animals:  1. The neonates (babies) could be sick/have a defect and the mother can sense that   2. The baby may have died and she is cleaning up her nest   3. The new mother may become too vigorous in her attempt to clean her newborn offspring or older offspring and accidentally hurts or kills them   4. The mother may have a vitamin/meneral deficiency so eats one (or more) of her offspring to gain nutrition from them so she can successfully raise the rest of the litter  5. A female may kill and eat another female's young because she is not a alpha female in the pack or pride  6. The female feels threatened or feels danger is close  7. Because she is hungry    For male animals:  1. To bring females back into season (heat) so they can mate and pass on their own genes  2. The male accidentally killed one of his offspring  3. The male is removing a dead body from the nest site  4. Because he is hungry    There is probably loads more reasons, but unfortunately we can't ask animals all the reasons they do the things they do.|`|tT256JQRaa	for several reasons.    there might be something wrong with the babies, that the mother picks up on, like they are diseased or really badly deformed or something, then the mother knows there is no need to take care of them and takes their energy to renew her own.    there could be danger around, and as it would be difficult for a single mother to move several, maybe 6 babies, to safety quickly, she eats them to be able to get away    if times are difficult, and there isnt much food around, the mother wont be able to feed her babies as she wouldnt be able to feed herself, so she would eat them to give herself energy to survive until next breeding season.    if an animal is stressed and feels a threat then it could eat the babies out of fear and self preservation - this mostly happens in like pet hamsters etc    animals on the whole though are pretty good mothers, and mostly do all they can to protect their babies :)|`|zoAGqAiPaa	Usually this occurs more in the rodent family. Mothers will usually have up to 6 babies in one litter. She will pick out the smallest and weakest and usually eat it. The reason of this is because she feels it is holding her other babies back. She will not have the time to nurture it all the time with all of the other babies. Does this answer your question??|`|meMF69tXaa	I learned this when I was training to be a Vet Tech.    First you have to start with the afterbirth and the reason behind why animals in the wild consume it. Most predators pick up on the scent of birth and mothers in the wild consume the afterbirth and clean their offspring in a hurry to rid themselves of a scent that predators may pick up on.    Second, small animals/rodents consume their young not only for the same reason that they do in the wild, but also because the mother senses that something is wrong with their offspring, or the need proper nutrients that they are not getting through their diet. Trust me, as gross as it may seem, it is a normal and very natural process in the animal kingdom.    They also eat and abandon their young when a strange scent is on them, which is why I do not recommend handling the young if you can help it during the first weeks of their lives.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	Not all do that.

I would strongly suspect parvo if he had never been vaccinated.   The clinical signs certainly do fit.  A one year old dog unvaccinated can certainly get this disease.  I have seen dogs as old as 2-4 test positive.  The only other common poison for dogs to get into that causes bleeding is rat bait.  The gastric ulcer is also a good possibilty, but the question would be how did he get that?  I am very sorry for your pup.  I hope you find some answers.|`|2LHcmYmuaa	my dog recently died too. he was eating very well infact eating more than normal when suddenly he went off his food, we tried forcing him to eat but he wasn't having any of it. also he was drinking a significant amount of water. he was very down. and would go out and be unable to bring himself in again.one vet we brought him to said it was poison possibly paraquat. we brought him to another who said poisoning  but then a blood test said it was not and he said possibly stomach ulcers. he also passed bloody diarrhoa. he stayed for the week and was on medication and the vet got him eating. but the next morning we were in to bring him home he wouldn't eat so he was kept in there. the vet operated and found large ulcers in his stomach. the dog died after the operation. ... no Deter.    people put out poisons for rats and it could have been hidden in foods your dog likes.|`|AA11853631	You should have a necropsy(autopsy) done to see why he died.

He may not have been socialized correctly and/or he may have temperamental issues.  His runny nose could just be due to the fact that he is a member of the brachiocephalic family, meaning that his nose is 'smooshed.'  Keep an eye on him, and if his 'condition' persists, consult your vet.|`|A7BKo0ikaa	well they are puppies and they do sleep a lot and have wet noses .  and they also are getting use to you r home and the surroundings that your puppy is in.|`|7ad28686ba282ef67ac0be0e7f77c323aa	The looking at the ceiling & the lack of motivation & the fact he doesnt cry & whine could be sign's of brain damage or water head ??

Runny noses are also common in pugs (They are a brachycephalic breed and this is common in this type of breed) but that doesn't mean there's not something wrong.     The 2 things in your post that worry me are him looking at the ceiling when you carry him (could be indicative of a neurological problem, pugs are prone to things like pug dog encephalopathy) and  the fact that he doesn't walk or play a lot (I need more info on this like how much is "a lot"?)

The most popular excuse people have for  not doing this humane thing is that the people  can't afford it.  Anyone or everyone   I see can afford some nice things, but cannot   afford spaying or neutering their pets.    It all goes back to the same thing,   people, or humans, are selfish, and   the other animals are second rate   and less important than people.  That viewpoint does not hold  true in all cases, but then you have "flaming  conservatives" who think The Rainbow  Warrior is a "flaming liberal" flagship.    Convert everything in life to political, that  will force people to choose up sides  the right or the left.  Oh, make people neuter their pets if they  are not breeders, that's wrong, right?  That dollar is so important, and neutering or  spaying is a lower priority than having a nice  car or a nice entertainment system.  The  other animals are less important because  they don't vote, I suppose.  And yeah, I am   angry, because I go to the pound.  I'm  glad I don't work there.  Plenty of people  will say, "Oh, I don't want to see that", while  these cats have a dog they are certain   will not jump the fence, a dog that hasn't been fixed.|`|AA11244754	I wish I could but I have 2 really good reasons:  1) my apt. only allows small dogs and he looks like he's too big  2) my Schmitty (my dog) is not friendly toward other dogs.|`|kzGatIlWaa	Thank you so much for your effort........I was the one who posted it first.

AA10117627	I currently have pet insurance for my dog be careful and read the terms and conditions of the policy, most policies will not cover  any existing injury. The policy i have is called petplan it allws you to choose the level of cover you want it requires that you pay the first $100 of the claim and the insurance covers the rest. I think its worth it vet fees can be really expensive and can really burn a whole in your wallet if you can't afford it.    Regular vet visits need to be maintained to make an insurance claims, claims can be made as many times in one year to the amount insured. Visit your vet they can recommend and explain the best plans to suit you and your pets|`|ICBKpZeAaa	I found some good info here.|`|399226d5094730d171b769cebc7bbf93aa	It has it's ups and downs like any insurance.

de3314c4c028f2a4dc1a7d895d5e306aaa	Yes, I had a beautiful male, part-Siamese with 2 extra toes on all four paws!!!  Naturally, he had to be named "Thumbs".  It actually looked like he was wearing boxing gloves on all fours!  I was living in Florida at the time I had him.  At the Hemingway Home and Museum of the late, great Ernest Hemingway, in Key West, FL, there are at least 60 of these cats residing there.  Some of these cats are descendents of the one sole, polydactly feline given to Hemmingway by a ship's captain who knew him.  This trait is a cause of inbreeding.  They can be blessed with extra toes on the front paws, or all four as my beloved Thumbs was.  They are quite adorable.|`|Vgf2fdChaa	im pretty sure that a polydactyl cat is also a cat who is "double pawed".  I know some people like to look for this odd trait in a pet.

5139PTTmaa	Evaporation or moisture from the nose helps cool the dog. Another is that added moisture in the nose makes the dog more sensitive to odors.The most boring answer is that many digs simply lick their noses with their tongues, thus wetting them.    Hope that helped (:|`|FfNKLG7Gaa	That means that they are hydrated.... when dogs get dry noses, that's not normal, and most likely they are sick.|`|373401aa6002dca10319fcc0448387e8aa	This moisture first attracts and then collects molecules from lots of placesthe air, the ground and from objects. The reason a dog often licks its nose is to keep it moist.    A dogs nose also has lots of mucous inside. If unfolded and spread out, the surface area of the dogs nasal membranes would be about the size of a handkerchief.

IuYekkPVaa	Your assessment of the situation seems spot on to me.  Sadly by confining the resident cat to one room, it means that when she has been given access to the rest of the home she is now marking in a desperate attempt to hold on to her territory.  If she's being harassed by the children as well, she must be feeling very insecure at the moment.  I don't want to lecture, but the children need be taught to respect animals, especially as there are other animals in the home.    It would be best if you can adopt the cat as she already knows you and with careful introduction to your own cat things could work out well for everyone.  As you seem to have a good understanding of cat psychology, you'll appreciate that as cats are territorial animals it may take some time for the two to accept each other.   When my cat Sophie was six months old, we adopted a feral kitten Merlin.  Sophie would attack him at every opportunity and they were not left together without supervision.  It took about six weeks for her to accept him and now they get along great.  Two years on, they still don't cuddle up together, but they do enjoy playing together.     I've posted a couple of links to sites containing information on how to introduce a new cat to an existing one.    Good luck, I really do hope that it works out well for all concerned.    http://www.catgroup.org/live_harmony_112...   http://www.wikihow.com/Introduce-a-New-C...|`|TRbUAtDuaa	if your son must find a home for the cat try asking a vet to see if you may put up a flier about the cat. you could also try putting posters in your local grocery store or put a ad in a local paper. then your are able to find the cat a loving home  and maybe a special place in someones heart.|`|Vxbywa0maa	How old is the other cat. If it is older and fixed, it should be OK to introduce him into your house. There will be some attitude changes, but probably in the long run they will be good. I am a pet rescuer and have introduced many new cats and kittens into my house for periods of time. For a while they will hiss and growl at each other, then everything goes back to normal, once dominance is established. If this other cat is not fixed, I would have it fixed, before I brought it home. Unfixed males are just too aggressive and will pee and poop to show dominance.|`|VKCzenYGaa	Yes, it does seem that you have a good sense of cats' needs regarding territory and respect in the manner of moving them into the house.  That alone makes me also think you would be a great candidate for adopting this kitty... Please see the book title I've included - it has an absolutely Excellent chapter on introducing new pets to established pets. Even though you know something about this already, you may find her method to work even better... The website below also provides Valuable insights into cat behaviour and interactions which could make life for your cat and this one very healthy and happy.  Good luck.|`|ZKIFW5nqaa	I am not sure about the people in the situation, but I can advise you about the cats. When I got my second cat, a kitten, we already had one "old man" cat who was probably about 10 or 12 at the time. They hated each other at first (they were both neutered males), but I kept an eye on them to make sure they didn't fight, and they soon became very affectionate and often slept curled up together. Just give them time.

70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	They can stay in heat off and on for months.Unless a cat is bred,she will stay in heat.This is very bad for her,and it can cause an infection of the uterus called pyometra,which is fatal if not treated with emergency spay surgery and antibiotics.A lot of cats died even with treatment. And,no,11 is not too old to have her spayed.11 is not that old for a cat,as they can live well into their 20s.So you would be wise to call and make an appointment to have both cats spayed asap,so you won;t have to worry about pyometra ,unwanted kittens and the annoyances that come along with a heat cycle.    http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    http://www.acvs.org/AnimalOwners/HealthC...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyometra|`|LM7DWcdlaa	Its not too late to get them fixed. They can be spayed at any age, but its preferred as kittens. Females can be in heat for 5 to 14 days. Also, cats are seasonally polyestrous, which means they will come into heat every 14 to 21 days, so im sure its been more often than that.   Female cats are a lot more emotional than male cats, and wont put up with many things. It could be there personality. However, their hormones could be playing in on that.   Hope this has helped.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	I would ask, I would prob get them fixed.  Problem might get worse cause they are getting older.|`|kNhYFgCTaa	I would honestly get her fixed. It will ONLY get more annoying with time. Trust me they will not stop. And whn they do, prepare for another episode in a little while. Maybe a longer one. And if you're cat is an outdoor cat, I don't know if letting it outside is such a good idea,  unless you want 20 male cats from all over the city or town, or wherever you may live on your lawn. And a cat in heat + an unfixed male cat = BABIES.     in short, get her fixed! lol|`|XB68v39haa	Your cat must see a \Vet. age is a number.

I hope she gets better!!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Poor puppy!  How did she break her leg?!  You need to wash her whole body gently with dog shampoo and warm water.  That should help with the smell.  It's probably a skin infection from the splint.  She might need antibiotics - and/or topical medications to keep it clean and help it heal.  She probably has been chewing on her paw if you didn't have a special collar on her that keeps her from doing that... and that is why her paw looks funny.  Poor thing!|`|AA11821715	Maybe there was a cut when it got hurt and it got infected under the cast. Put some Hydrogen Peroxide on the paw, if it bubbles, there is an infection and the peroxide will kill the infection. If there is an infection, keep applying the peroxide every hour or so about 4 or five times. Then go to the vet and the puppy may need antibiotics or penicillin of whatever they give puppies.|`|Yvdg31WGaa	You Probably need to use your best judgment on this one.   I'm not a dog but I broke my arm in two places and my arm was really swollen for a week or so. If you think the cast is too tight let the vet know right away. My cast was also too tight, cutting off the circulation in my arm, They cut a slit in my cast.     Since the dog can't tell you that it is too tight you have to make the observation... Is the paw getting even more swollen as time passes? If you really think the cast is too tight, you are probably right. Vets make mistakes too.    Take her to the Vet.. if her paw is continuing to swell there is obviously something wrong. It's better to be safe than sorry and a vet will know what to do when they see it.    Also getting water inside a cast will make it smell, if you didn't bathe the dog and it smells it could very well be an infection... especially in that little of time.|`|zXknLaTlaa	There are many things that could have caused this to happen and there is no one good answer. So you are doing the best thing you could do for your furkin by taking them to the vet.Just make sure at this time that they know they are loved, have plenty of water and are comfortable for the night.

sSCgPzZaaa	A ferret is a great pet.  They are affectionate and love attention.  But they can be quite loud, when jumping around in their cage.  They also stink pretty bad so you have to have them descented  & they do need a big cage.  So this pet is very costly    A hamster is very easy to take care of.  As long as you get one at a fairly young age, they will be very easy to tame, and they are less expensive then ferrets, though they dont live that long.    Sugar Gliders have to live in pairs. It's a MUST.  They are extremely expensive to buy & take care of, and you have to make their food for them, which can be very time consuming,  they also make ALOT of noise and need alottttt of room to stay comfortable  They may be very cute, but they are a big responsibility    Hope i helped|`|fBMSIlSIaa	I think you should research a lot about each animal and see which one fits your lifestyle best.

3LXbUg1raa	Pin firing, or thermocautery, was once a popular practice for healing chronic tendon injuries and bucked shins/shin splints in horses. A small red-hot probe of some kind is used to cauterize (burn) tissue in a horse. More often than not, this process leaves a series of small white 'dots' in rows in the area of the horse's leg that was pin fired. This is a picture of what it tends to look like: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1327/1397... Pin firing does not make a race horse run faster at all...and about the only reason it may be said to 'prolong' a race horse's career is that it is thought to strengthen that area of the leg that was treated. It is most commonly used for bucked shins or shin splints in race horses. Race horses are more prone to getting bucked shins due to the hard pounding/strain placed on their legs at a very young age (2-3 yrs old). It is thought by some that when a horse gets bucked shins, when the horse heals, the bone will be stronger than before the horse got bucked shins. So, some trainers will actually cause shin splints on purpose in a 2yr old race horse in the thought that it will strengthen the horse's legs/bones. Pin firing causes inflammation and is also thought to help heal chronic injuries by increases the circulation to that area...Pin firing does not normally seem to have any long term negative effects; once healed, the only undesirable problem with pin firing is that it leaves permanent white 'dots' in the area that was treated, which might be bad in a show horse since it would be seen as a 'blemish'...It has mostly fallen out of practice in the US as other treatments have become available...    You may find this article to be interesting: http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Although I am not entirely sure i have come across a few thoroughbreds that firing pins have been used on.    I am under the impression that some sort of hot pin is inserted into the leg. it deadens the pain receptors and will make an unsound horse sound.|`|9UttDvcsaa	I believe pin firing has something to do with the long ligaments on the front of the legs and it causes the TBs to reach out farther at the gallop.  In the long term all that support deteriorates, it is unnecessary and cruel bc it causes all sorts of problems and helps little as far as speed goes on a truly talented horse.|`|odp8Fy5Laa	Pinfiring is a way of creating scar tissue on a horse's shins. There were two common ways to do this in racing barns when I worked there in the 80s: pinfiring and blistering. Both are sort of archaic, ineffective, and not very nice IMO. The process for pinfiring is to sedate the horse and burn rows of little points on his shins, lay him off for awhile until it heals, and assume the resulting scar tissue prevents bucked shins. Blistering is a similar process involving painting a solvent on the shins that, well, blisters. A healing and layoff period is also necessary.  I've seen worse but kind of agree it's barbaric.    You can see the pinpoints on the front legs of an older OTTB who's been pinfired, but it doesn't mean he isn't sound. I'm not sure it actually prolongs their careers, and it definitely doesn't make them faster. Maybe the required rest does help them, though. But scar tissue, while tougher, is less flexible than the original.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	They pinfire bowed tendons mostly, somehow it reduces the strain and inflammation.  Thermocautery, or pinfiring as it is commonly known in the horse industry, has been around for ages. Conflicting ideas as to what pinfiring actually does have persisted over time. In ancient times, fire was believed to have magical properties, especially with regard to healing chronic ailments. Due to this belief, thermocautery has been commonly used as a medical procedure.     With firing, generally a hot iron is used to effectively burn, sear, or destroy tissue. While often done with a pointed iron (hence, the name "pin-fire"), it also can be done using a horizontal iron bar to affect only the skin and not to extend into the underlying tendons. Alternatively, firing can be done with the iron dipped in liquid nitrogen and then applied to the horse's leg, a procedure called freeze-firing.  Pinfiring and blistering. These two painful "counterirritation" procedures were once done routinely on horses with chronic bone and soft-tissue conditions, since it was believed that such chronic inflammations could slowly generate performance-hindering scar tissue. To deliberately turn the chronic condition into an acute one, veterinarians used either caustic substances painted onto the skin over an injury and then bandaged, or a firing iron whose round point was used to create a pattern of burns. The goal was to generate a strong reaction that would heal the chronic underlying condition.     Though no studies had been done to verify the efficacy of pinfiring and blistering, they were widely believed to be beneficial. But about a 15 years ago, researchers finally probed the procedures' efficacy and found them useless. Pinfiring was soon banned in Great Britain, and both procedures fell out of use in the United States and elsewhere.  http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...|`|dU7K1OIIaa	I work with racehorses and pin firing in my opinoin it is pretty useless but what it does is. If your horse has broken down quite badly, e.g got a hole in his tendon or sore shins then they are pin fired or bar fired, similar technique same rsult and it basically causes damage so blood flow is increased to that area. It does the same amount of help as 12 months in field would cept they only need up to 6 months of. No it doesn't prolong their career or help them run faster it is ahealing method. Sometimes it orks and sometimes it doesn't it's a last resort kind of thing. If it fails the horse is screwed for racing.
Mxq1NQJdaa	Good answers here about the bathing.  Because he is geriatric kitty (mine died at 18 yrs) his skin is dryer than when he was young cat.    I didn't see anything about brushing this guy!  There are some great brushes that will remove undercoat and old hair.  All of my kittys (including wild kitty) loves to be brushed.  It only takes them smelling the brush to know that it is something they want to explore further and will normally allow it right away.  This will 'milk' the oils and work them into his fur and skin.  Will decrease fur balls and make him feel generally more comfortable.  Suspect he will rub his face on it as well, so steady his head so that you can gently brush his face and ears as well.|`|uuudmeyyaa	You wouldn't need to take him to a bunch of vets,  just one would be able to figure out the problem. All we can do is give you suggestions, but it is possible no suggestion will fix the problem. This would mean your poor old kitty would be miserable during the last part of his life, and no one wants that... so please consider taking him to a vet, and hope that someone cares enough for you when you are old to take you to the doctor when you have problems.    My suggestion: If you are SURE he doesn't have fleas, he could have an allergy. You say he is bathed regularly... this probably is NOT a good thing. Regular bathing washes off natural oils that protect the skin, and this could cause irritation. Also if you are using any soap at all this is probably the cause of his itchiness. You shouldn't bathe a cat very often (I would say no more than once or twice a month). If he gets dirty there are special wipes you can buy for pets, and just wipe off the part of him that gets dirty (feet, bum, whatever).    He could also have developed an allergy to his food. Over time some people and pets can become allergic to something that was previously fine. You may want to consider switching him to a different food, but you probably want to talk to a vet before you do this, as it might not be the problem and could upset his tummy which isn't good in such an old animal. One of the number one signs of a food allergy (besides throwing up) is itchiness, so please be aware this is a possibility.     Hope that helped a little, but you really should take him to a vet. A kitty that old needs lots of special care!|`|LM7DWcdlaa	Cats have scent glands in their cheek area and rub their faces against objects, sometimes quite hard, to put their scent on the object and claim it. Its normal. My cat does this as well. It may also feel good to him. When you pet him, itch him gently with your nails...this may help. He may also have a skin condition, but from what you say, it sounds totally normal.|`|487pYnzraa	Wow..17year is an old old cat..    From what I know we are not suppose to bath cat too often as it will lost its skin moisture.. Maybe his skin is too dry? or that he is allergy to the shampoo? Or maybe there's something in the ear like lice tat cause the itch? Or my guess is that he is too old and skin is more vulnerable thus a harsh scratch will cause the skin breaks easily.    Try shower every forthnight or a mth.. if u can, then see if problem still persists..
uJ0Z8hzSaa	well the next time he pulls on his leash spank him  the next time he pulls spank him more then if he wont stop take him on a LONG walk with a short leash that sould stop it.|`|dXcm5971aa	1. Cut up tiny (just a taste) pieces of your dogs favorite treats/cheese and hold some in your hand where the dog can smell it, but cant snatch it.  2. While your pooch is on leash (regular kind, not retractable), let him get a whiff of the snack in your hand then place your hand close to your leg on the heel side, put your hand near his nose and guide him that way (trust me he'll follow the snack-if not try a different treat) as you walk. If (only if) hes still following you after about 5-10 steps quickly pop the treat in his mouth (w/a Good Boy!) and have another ready immediatly to continue in this manner. This is hard to discribe without visuals, but if you get the idea and try it yourself, you'll see it will work with patientce.  The dog learns that to stick by you instead of pulling is much more rewarding.  3. Try this technique first in a quiet place without distractions (your backyard maybe, but keep the kids in the house) after doing this a few (or, if your schedule allows once a day for 15-30 mins) for a week, then try it out on a quiet street. Once you and your pooch are comfortable there, work up to busier places with more distractions. Eventually you will be able to wean your pooch off of treats completly (I find with my dog, I only need them if there are major distractions)  4. Remember: Dogs take patientce and time. The more time you put in the better you results will be. Try signing up for some classes if you still need help, there are plently low cost group lessons out there availible.|`|uIvb5eqoaa	get a halter/ gentle lead.  That eliminates pulling.  If you want to train your dog, there is a method where every time your dog pulls on the leash, you very quickly turn around and start moving quickly in the opposite direction.  When your dog turns to go with you, whether by his own accord, or by you snapping the collar, you praise him.  Do not walk your dog using a harness.  They are designed to encourage your dog to pull.  But in short you can't expect your dog to train itself.  Both of you need to put work into your dog if you expect any kind of result.  Beware, all bully breeds are stubborn so keep working at it.  If you can't do it yourself, enroll in an obedience class.|`|lmSffrNuaa	There are many training options to get your dog to walk on loose leash, and some options work better than others.

GyB5Yfgmaa	They do fight in the pet store and many fishes died but because they are crowded you don't see it. In the morning they just scoop out the dead fishes and throw them away.  I used to work in a pet shop.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	Not really a pet store secret but the best way to stop cichlid aggression is to overstock the tank.    Same applies at home..alot of cichlid tanks are purposefully kept overstocked to tame aggression. Its more work put a peaceful tank...    In the pet store its just by coincidence but they know piling them up stops aggression.    Put 10 in a 50 gallon and everybody starts fighting for territory and hierarchy and fish get killed everywhere. Put 20 in and all the fighting stops.     There agression is part of what makes them great,embrace and don't get mad as these fish scream darwinism at it's best.    Africans are far more mean than south americans but S.A are usually much bigger.      good luck|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Cichlids are aggressive by nature. If you like the cichlid family the do some research on the less aggressive types. Rams  and oscars are less aggressive than most if they grow up in a community setting. Discus are also very peaceful but it takes a little more work to keep them healthy.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Well, they are most likely too stressed in a pet shop to start fighting. They are stressed from the move, lots of fish come from overseas. Most of the fish you see are very new and the tanks are all overstocked. The reasons why they aren't fighting in the tanks are because they are trying to establish themselves in a overstocked tank, they don't even have time to fight, they are just constantly stressed. Once you get them home, they are fighting for territory.|`|EyKJ737daa	Moving fish from place to place will put them out of sorts for a while but hopefully they will settle down.  How long have you had them.  Give them a couple of weeks to settle in and get the pecking order right between them all in the tank.  Good luck|`|9kceDOTraa	They are not so much getting along in the pet store as most of the time, they are kept in a tank too small, and they are intermixed, in numerous cases with fish they shouldn't be mixed with.  You combine this with the high odds they are kept in water chemistry conditions not proper for them, and you just aren't going to see their true behavior.    It's very misleading to compare a pet store to a home kept tank.  First thing is that a store usually has high traffic and more noise in it then the typical home is going to have.  Most keepers of fish at home, usually offer a bigger tank, if they know what they are doing.  A home keeper is the one that will make sure the tank is maintained properly and the water parameters are put to the right conditions.  A pet store, with all the tanks they have, usually don't have the time to do everything correctly.    Pet store tanks are basically temporary tanks.  They have fish going in and out of the tanks all the time, and this doesn't provide stability.  Fish that first get put into a tank, after being bagged up and shipped for a trip, are still under stress, and that stress transfers to the other tank occupants depending on how many and other factors.    Keep in mind this.  Cichlids encompass over 2000 different species.  They come from all different parts of the world, growing to various different sizes, have different diet needs, and different water chemistry needs.  If you are keeping mostly South American types, and you follow this often misunderstood concept of overstocking to reduce aggression (which by the way, actually increases aggression and stress, it doesn't reduce) you'll find it doesn't work well and you will have deaths.    Best to narrow things down to what species you are keeping and get better advice which is narrowed into what works for the actual species you have.  Very few facts in general apply to all cichlids.  A great number of them are geared towards individual species though.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	The reason why is they are overstocked and that keeps the aggression down. Another thing is that most of the LFS keep their tanks bare bottom and have no decorations. Without tank decor and substrate they can not territorieserritories. Finally, theaggressionsually have them long enough for any real damage since these are very popular fish.    Unless you are willing to have your tank bare in your home  I'd recommend Texas Holey rock and caves. If you have plenty of hiding places it helps keep the agression down to a minimum.|`|tDcItiATaa	If you watch them long enough at the pet store, you will see that they DO in deed fight amongst each other. They are no more comfortable there than at your home. The key is, and probably what the case is at the pet store, is to over crowd the cichlids. This is done by most cichlid owners, though however, imay be a little out of line!..  See, i have a 50 Gallon with 7 cichlids, 2 eels 1 being 40cm, 2 algae eaters 1 being 4inch, 1 bristle nose, shrimp, brigs.    I have plenty of room but my fish show little aggression. very little.  The main time you see anything is at feeding time.  The reason being with my fish is because of their and my interactiveness. I play with my fish often, hand feed, etc. Their personalities have changed alot from their natural enviroment.  Though this is not the case for pet stores, they over crowd the population to control their aggression, what this does is keeps more moving distractions/targets.      this is my cichlids having a feed of blackworms if your interested  http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=-G2QvTOYPi...      hope this helps|`|vSUfNm1Zaa	try this... when u are going to add new fish to tank take some water in mug put ur new fish in there for a day then put fish food in one corner of tank n leave ur new fishes in other corner they wont fight,,,,,,n if now they figth still then      reduce oxygen supply ......more oxygen more the fish become active n fight|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	well, its because they are in a huge tank with many other fellows their size and strength, when you bring them home they don't see as many bullies and decide to become the new bully of the tank

8owlj2xHaa	It depends on what kind of lighting. Metal halides need to be on for at least 6 hours. 7 would be better.  T-5 should be on for about 8-10 hours.  VHO or other Florescents need to be on for 12 hours.  Moon lights can be run opposite the normal light schedule. Try to not turn them on a couple of days a week or 1 week a month.     I am very tired of hearing the light causing algae thing. Algae can not grow without food. The primary food for algae is Phosphorus. Phosphorus comes from tap water and uneaten fish food. It does not come from running the lights to long alone. Poor water quality itself is the cause of algae in a reef tank.  In a salt water tank with coral you must light them the appropriate way for the appropriate time, as the zooanthelle in them needs to photosynthesize for them to survive.|`|H06PtiIAaa	i leave my lights on for at least 12 hours to simulate a natural setting.    i turn the led lunar lights at night, but you dont really need it, it just helps with the natual cycle.|`|93m7LZCeaa	lights do encourage more algae growth.  i think at the most 5 hours a day.  however if you have real live plants they need the light to survive and generally redue nitrates and algae  i generally turn my on at night and at feeding time|`|YnCUyvK7aa	The corals that you buy for saltwater are mostly from around the Equator, so they'd naturally receive about 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark per day.  But because of the potential for unwanted algae growth, the bright lights, the ones that are white, or 10,000K, are only on about 8 hours, and the blues or 50/50 on for an hour before and after.    You can have the LEDs on when the others aren't for the full 14 hours, or only have them on for a an hour or 2 before and after the blues come on or go off.|`|ssHzAVlwaa	it all depends. if you leave your life on for 5-8 houyrs, you;ll get green algae growing in your tank.

He definitely has some Persian in its background.  Big round eyes, round head.  But he lacks the small, round ears and flat face of a Persian.  So he's maybe a generation or two from Persian - most likely crossed with a domestic cat.    He looks like he could use some grooming.  Cats like this shouldn't be brushed.  Brushes pull out and break topcoat hairs and do little to remove the loose hairs of the undercoat.  Get a good quality steel-toothed comb and comb the coat. This will gently remove the loose hairs of the undercoat and leave the topcoat intact.  You really should be combing him at least every other day to prevent mats - which can be VERY painful as they pull at the skin the worse the mat gets.    He doesn't look too happy to have that garland wrapped around him.    edit: LOL to the two thumbs down!  Sorry I know cat breeds!

As soon as you get off then spend another hour exercising the dog before going out and another hour before bed. There's no reason your friends and or your girlfriend can't go along sometimes and if they'd prefer not to be around the dog then so be it. Who do you live with the dog or them?

They have to be the best, I mean they are so scary, they will lick you to death!!!!      check this out     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl93Hc1uH...|`|2mEV9H04aa	i think rottweilers r the best breed they are sweet  gentle and big babys who just want to be loved but at the same time protestive of there family|`|jXHLZS5Laa	There is no "best breed". It depends upon the owner's lifestyle and personality. There are dogs that are very beautiful but high maintenance and some wouldn't want to own such because of their busy lifestyles. Some want small dogs, others large dogs, or medium dogs.    My favorite breed is German Shepherd because of their intelligence and loyalty. Second is the rottweiler who is also very smart and super sweet.|`|7K8cKXOxaa	border collie|`|08aiOlKBaa	pug!!|`|rLDf1gGGaa	A best BREED depends on your lifestyle, room you have, size if yard  your energy require, and how much grooming, must match the energy requirements of the dog. NO one breed suits EVERYONE and remember yahoo answer people will generally recommend there favorurite breed, which may not suit you, also dog breed selectors aren't accurate.    I suggest the Best dog is ANY breed, Purebred,Crossbred,Mutt, that you can SAVE  a LIFE, thats suit your lifestyle available at a shelter/pound/rescue.    Dogs that have been uprooted from their happy homes or have not had the best start in life are likely to bond very closely to their new owner.  Yes, dogs that have lost families through death, divorce or lifestyle change can go through a mourning process; however, once they become attached to their new family, they seem to want to please as much as possible to make sure they are never homeless again!  Those dogs that are just learning about the good life and good people seem to bond even deeper. They know what life on the streets, life on the end of a chain, or worse, is about, and they revel and blossom in a nurturing , loving environment. Most rescues make exceptional , extremely loyal companions.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Best is a relative term. What is best for me probably isn't best for you or the next person.    Are you looking for a breed to own and trying to narrow it down?|`|F17bGTAOaa	A mutt - truly American|`|jXXRf7Hyaa	it really depends on what kind of a dog you are looking for for ex, friendly, cuddley, playfull, energetic etc.         i love my boxer tho|`|mFNEbR3Maa	JRT and LABS|`|d6HXwlpPaa	I love an American water Spaniel breed called the Boykin Spaniel, they are attentive, smart, as comfortable in water as on land, they never smell and they are cute as they come, bonus they are the state dog of South Carolina.

OjeL1if4aa	What exactly are the judges looking for in the flat classes at a Hunter show? The jumping classes?    Most judges are looking at the horse's overall conformation, movement, and ability. The horse should move on a relaxed rein with very little contact in nice working strides at all 3 gaits and sometimes at a hand gallop. Horses should generally be flat kneed with big, flowing strides and a good working hind end.    Over fences, hunters are judged on consistency, ability, and form. A good hunter will have level knees with tight, tucked lower legs. Also a good push from behind, but isn't over-exerting itself in the jump. The horse should have good consistency in stride, and his form over fences. There shouldn't be a huge difference in his form... though it does vary depending on direction and jump size for most horses, but it's not a huge, visible difference.     Warmbloods are the new "in thing" for hunters... but they cost a pretty penny and not everyone can afford a $10-$20k horse who's price is based on breed alone. Around here, weanlings and yearlings don't even sell for less than $10,000!    Size shouldn't matter, if your horse is capable of jumping and looks good doing it, then that's all that should matter. I can't say that it is always what goes because judges can and are biased towards certain breeds. I knew of a judge who flat out would not place an appy in the hunter ring, reguardless of how good/flashy he was. It's sad that it's like that.     My only advice is to give it a try and see how he places... every judge is going to be different, but you can tell by watching a few classes ahead of you with like horses weather or not you're going to have a chance. If it's obvious the judge is pinning the bigger, flashier horses, then ride and school your classes. It's all you can do... at bigger shows you can't scratch without a vet's note.    Good Luck!|`|DdpvxfkNaa	Judges look for how well your horse moves, your position, your condition, and your horses condition.     Good luck!     Also, how much your enjoying your ride. But that is not a big factor..it depends on the judge.|`|4XUUVDM3aa	Movement, movement, movement. If you have a horse that is a great mover you are more likely to get noticed. It's depends on the class you are in. Some judge more on the rider then the horse or on both. I say go with your horse who may not be flash and have a good time.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	It depends on if you're showing equitation or hunter under saddle (since the judge is looking at YOU in eq, and the horse in u/s)    I'll assume you're talking about u/s since you're concerned about your horse fitting in.  Hopefully the judge can get past the breed/color and actually judge it.  But, anyway, in hunters, judges like to see a forward moving horse (ground covering = good, but not to be mistaken with running around crazy out of control).  You just want to be in a good working walk, working trot, working canter, etc - not extended, not collected, and not lazy.  I've had judges ask to collect/extend, but the normal pace should be a ground covering working pace.  I think they want to see a sort of flat motion in the horse's legs - low and sweeping to cover more ground, as high knee action is just a waste of energy / is inefficient.  And they love love love a horse with an even rhythmic stride, but you want the horse to be able to open its stride down the lines when you're jumping/collect as needed.    My instructor would tell us to almost ride on a loose rein to show the horse can go fine without the rider's help (ie, that it won't take off running or something), and to almost ride in a half seat (I guess to help/encourage him to move forward by getting off his back?).  A good hunter was supposed to be a horse that was pleasant/easy to ride.  In the A circuit, they can actually ding you for having a crabby looking horse, I believe.  I have only shown in my state's hunter/jumper association, and used to ride the crabbiest of mares (ears always back) but man she was a nice hunter... flat, big, steady motion, jumped like a dream, super balanced and could do flying changes in her sleep.  Aww, now I'm getting sad, for I had the chance to buy her but she now has ringbone and can't jump much anymore :(    We sent some riders to an invitational and filmed all of their rounds, and a judge was able to sit with us and talk about her thought process and she watched the tapes and placed the riders - I remember her saying that she'd think to herself "which of these horses would I most like to take home with me at the end of the day" or "which of these horses looks like the nicest to ride" to help her decide.  It was all about which seemed easy, pleasant, etc.    If your guy is a nice mover, he should do well regardless of size.|`|7lsU5bcoaa	Technically you shouldn't be marked down on the size of your horse, hunters are not supposed to be judged on anything other than permormance. However judging in hunters in largely subjective. You may be placed lower based on something that "shouldn't" matter. Ideally, the only time a judge should take facotrs like personal preference towards a "type" of horse is when two horse perform exactly equally, two riders are equally good, the judge has to place one first and one second and places the horse (s)he likes better first.     Generally hunters look for a calm relaxed movement, a sweeping trot with very flat knees. The horse's head should be in a relaxed frame, longer and lower than you see in dressage. This is a good example of hunter movement: http://content.breederoo.com/users/sueho...  Generally hunters don't go too fast, but your horse shouldn't be sluggish. It should be calmly moving with impulsion.   Over fences you should be able to complete your course in a way that looks easy and effortless. Your horse should not struggle to make distances or change in pace. Their canter should remain steady throughout. Because it makes reaching distances easier, a large stride is ideal. This makes distances and jumps look natural and easy, without the horse speeding up. The ideal hunter jumps with high square knees and a rounded frame over fences.   Examples of ideal hunter form : http://www.hunterjumpernews.com/wp-conte...  http://www.lbehlinghunters.com/photos/iv...  You should come to the center of your jumps easily. i.e. you turn into a line, you should be well centered and aligned for the fence you are approaching. It's preferable that a horse gets its lead over the fence when jumping a diagonal, but flying lead changes are acceptable. SImple lead changes are OK in smaller training shows, but you may still be marked down for it.       Good luck!|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	This all really depends on the judge.  It is very sad if you   can't ride whatever breed and work toward meeting the   criteria.  Good luck with your horse.  Judges all have their preferences. Some will like your horse and yourself if you are good and others may go for "flavor of the week".    Do what you and your horse enjoy.|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	Normally judges look for   The condition of the horse  how good the horse looks   your riding postion   how you ride   mistakes   0
u7vrul2Faa	Yes I have this problem with one of my cats so I just shut her out of my bedroom. She can go and pester her sister instead! lol.|`|085DXX4Qaa	My girlfriend does that...    Oh wait. I don't have one.  Curses...    lol. My cat gets up in the middle of the night and tries to lay on my face.|`|54hVzylRaa	I swear they do it on purpose.|`|LGhr7TEvaa	It's the worst thing in the world. My toes and nose get nibbled, and my legs get scratched. My girlfriend and I take turns throwing him off the bed, but it's even worse when he clamps on to you on his way down!|`|DZedvrIraa	lol yes! that used to happen to me all the time...but if i pretended to be asleep my cat would leave me alone|`|ZnHTfNycaa	The award for "most annoying cat while you are trying to sleep" has to go to my 7 month old kitten Ricky.   My 2 older boys (9 and 10 years old) have the drill down. They know that when my husband and I climb into bed then it is time for them to settle down and go to sleep too. But NOT Ricky!  He thinks our bedroom is a race-car track and will dash madly across the foot of our bed. If anyone's foot, arm, or tail (from the other cats) are dangling over the edge of the bed then they will feel Ricky's wrath.   Many times during the middle of the night, I'm woken by a kitten chewing on my toe, finger, or nose.   There is a kicker though. In the morning after his night of terrors, he is so tired out that he sprawls out across the now empty bed and sleeps peacefully all day!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes!  He runs up and down the hallway, tossing his toy into the air, chasing it.  Meowing like crazy.  Kathump, kathump.  Jumping half way up the side of the wall just as if he sees some kind of bug or something.    Or, he jumps into my bed, climbs up on my chest or shoulder, "kneads" me and purrs.  Licks me with that little sandpaper tongue. Butts his head into my hand, which of course means "pet me, scratch behind my ears" or whatever.  Finally, settles down beside me, stays there 15 minutes, then he's off again to chase his toys down the hallway once again.    A while later, he wakes me and "kneads" again.  Woke me up 6 times Saturday night.  If I shut the door and he can't get in, he yowls loudly in the hallway till I open the door for him again.
2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	You either need to stay completely away from the pony or if your course of life requires you to be around your uncle's a lot then you need to solve this problem with the pony chasing you immediately.    It sounds like he has YOU trained, rather than the other way around.  He comes toward you and you run.  He keeps getting the same response because it's working every time.  You pose no threat whatever to him, so he chases you.  It is a form of disrespect of you and your space when he chases you.    You need to do a little training yourself so that he realizes that you will not respond to him by running.  There are several ways to accomplish this, but the easiest is to carry a lunge whip with you and instead of running, use it to encourage him to stop before he runs into any part of the whip.  Have your uncle present with you for a back-up.  Do this until the pony understands that you are not an object to be chased, but rather respected.  He is chasing you because, so far, nothing has stopped him from doing so.    Remember, if a horse can, he will, not because he is bad, but because he has an opportunistic nature.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Your best bet is to carry some sort of 'weapon' with you. Whether that is a whip, a crop, a knotted lead rope, or a rock is your choice. This is not cruel, when an 1000lb animal is chasing you down i don't care what you use to defend yourself. Its you or the horse and in this situation you are not gonna win.    Also, you need to make yourself big. Square your body to the horse (this is an aggressive posture) raise your arms and slowly flap them up and down. Increase in speed as they get closer if necessary. Then make noise: growl, shout, clap, buzz, stamp your feet, say no, and whoa. You have to out bluff the horse into thinking that you are a predator.|`|8cikAYp3aa	that needs to stop ASAP.  A horse or pony should NEVER EVER chase a human being in field.  its dangerous and will only get worse.    Carry a crop so he see's it.  use it if need be.  you can also carry a tin can or plastic soda bottle with some rocks in it.  When he comes to close and tries to chase you throw it at him.  the sound is enough to shock them into staying back. worse comes to worse.  I have carried a wiffle ball bat,  those big plastic ones for small kids to use .. the sound it makes is enough to back any horse off when they get hit with it.  And it wont hurt them.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Ok this is gonna sound crazy..but it works....  :-)    If he is chasing you to bite or kick you, it needs to stop.  The first thing you need to do it change his thinking, and that can be by having something that makes a loud noise, like popping a paper bag, or snapping a whip, and yes,, even if you have to throw something at him.. anything (without hurting him) to get his attention off you. He will think about it when he tries it again.  It is a game for him, so you need to turn the tables and let him know YOU are the boss. Once you get his attention on something else, have a plastic bag, a towel or anything big and wave it at him , yell if you have to and go towards him.  I know it sounds funny, but he needs to know you will not tolerate it.  By you "chasing" him, he will learn  he is on the bottom of the totem pole.  Then if you get the chance to catch and hold him, pet him and brush him. He won't be afraid of you but he will respect you.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	I guess the pony is chasing you in the field?  First, don't run away! Face the pony, stand your ground and make yourself look as BIG as possible, e.g. by holding your arms out.|`|4KY26xQqaa	DON'T RUN!  If he's doing it in a bad way and kicking out abit carry a crop for precations and if he done turn round and kick out smack his bum with it, don't absoute leather it down. A firm smack will do it.   They soon get the point. But if he is just chasing you in a good way, leave him mabye he just wants play.|`|vaulPrAmaa	carry a whip and smack him in the nose and make wsstt! noises at him.|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	DON'T do what renate told you   that is cruel and probley will just make him be mean and try to hurt you(even more if he already does)  it may be because he likes you if you can tie him up somewhere if u can if not ask your uncle what you can do  you can try growling but NEVER hit the horse unless your on top of him and u need to smake him with a crop to get him going  but smacking him on the ground will make him want to go even more remember  but wheva u do DON'T do what renate said|`|BQHbEwE8aa	OK. First, the reason why this pony is doing this is because he is too bold and disrespecting of you.  All horses live in a pecking order. In a herd of horses, there is a ranking of dominance. This pony is taking the opportunity to be dominant over you, and by you running away from him, you are allowing him to be the dominant one.     What you need to do is become positive. You need to tell yourself that you are the more powerful one in this relationship. You need to stand up tall, look him wide in the eye, square your shoulders and stand your ground.  Take a long rope or lead rope with you and enter the field. You can also take a long schooling whip if you like if this pony is really dangerous.  Get the rope and swing it round in circles in front of you when this pony thinks its time for chasing. If he approaches you too closely, WHACK, he gets hit by the rope!    Now, realise here that YOU didn't hit him with the rope. He hit himself with the rope - that was his decision to come too close to you. Now try and walk away and if he decides its chasing time again, stand your ground once more and swing that rope.   Be consistent with this and in time he will realise that chasing you is not much fun any more and isn't working because he keeps hitting himself by a circling rope!    If he becomes very aggressive in the field, you can always walk towards him with the rope twirling, or you can even use the whip and crack the ground with it. Remember the one who moves the OTHER one's feet is the dominant one in the relationship.    Do not allow this pony to chase you. It is dangerous and disrespectful.     But remember to stay emotionally detached from the situation. Adopt a business-like approach to the situation, do not stay angry with the pony. Once there is respect, there is an easier life, for the both of you.    Good Luck.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Carry a dressage whip with you if you must go into the pasture.  Make sure he sees it (i.e. don't point it directly at him or he may miss it).  e loud.  Slap the whip on the ground and say "GET OUTTA HERE!" or whatever you want, so long as it's in a loud, confident, not very nice tone.  You might want to try a lunge whip instead of a dressage whip, as it will make a nice cracking noise.  Just don't wait til he gets really close to you to crack it.  You don't want to be anywhere near him if he turns on his heels and bucks.|`|bliNBGxeaa	aha run away lil kid!!! run away and never return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Take a stick and tie a plastic bag to it and when they come near you shake it at them. im sure it will scare them away.

You would have to give a small puppy a TINY amount (my 80 pound dog gets 2 teaspoons full, so a 10 pound dog would get 1/4 teaspoon)  Just figure out what would be required for your puppy.    Don't feed her for 24 hours, and when you do start feeding her again start with boiled chicken and rice (no salt or seasonings), then gradually switch back to what you normally feed.

She worked with wildlife in California...but the owl she had was injured and could not survive in the wild.       It isn't legal to have an owl for a pet and would be extremly difficult for you in time.  If he is fine, let him go.  If he is injured contact  your local wildlife rehab offices.  They will place the owl in a proper environment.      The owl will need to eat mice, probably around 4 a day.     At a later time would become very territorial, nothing like the pet birds you have read about....    Bad Luck, not a chance...Just maybe for the owl if he has to endure life in an environment not meant for him...  It certainly isn't bad luck for you.
XxU94aKlaa	This is abuse- Can you get a recording of the guy saying he does this, pictures, videos, or anything to that effect of any of this?   This is horribly cruel and this dog needs removed from this individual ASAP.   You walk your dog so your dog can use the toilet, as long as the dog is going outside it should be fine. Restroom habits have NOTHING to do with dominance unless there is submissive urination.  Hitting a dog on the nose besides the obvious stupidity and mental issues it will cause can also cause serious medically issues.    I urge you to call your local humane society as soon as possible to get this dog removed from this horrible situation, especially if this individual refuses to go to some training classes to learn what he should be doing,|`|HuJmTs8xaa	Ok. Well, we have a Siberian Husky. She's my sister's dog. I know all about the dominant behaviour, but your friend has it all wrong. The dominance is towards other dogs. Sisko (our Siberian) recently attacked our little Border Collie and for no reason other than jealousy. She hurt her very bad.  She hates if we show any attention to the other dogs and to our bigger dogs, she play fights, but will never bring them down because the dominance is also just going after the weak or the ones that won't defend themselves. Your friend's behaviour towards Shadow could almost be called emotionally abusive. That's cruel of him to make her pee or poop only in his yard. I mean, that dog is not trying to be dominant by going in someone else's yard and "disobeying" her owner. She just has to go. And also, table scarps are VERY bad for dogs. It can reduce the life expectancy considerably, especially if the foods are really greasy or bad. And I would also advise you to advise your friend not to hit Shadow on the nose. I mean, sure, maybe the rump and if on the nose, maybe a tip, but not a hit. That dog is going to be messed up if he continues with the way he's treating her. He can't try to be dominant to a dog. I don't think they'd understand and that's not who they're dominant to, anyways.|`|zTSZgP3jaa	There are many ways to train a dog but the problem is with your friend not the dog. You need to take your friend to a training school so they know how to treat animals.    Also if you want more answers don't leave a ton of commentary. People don't like reading paragraphs here. The less you write the more comments you'll get.|`|K5ZWi2Mhaa	shock collar and wet tipped towel    dude you cant train an old dog    just gonna have to shoot ol yeller...he aint no good no more  wow Aussie...what are you ASPCA, theres dogs everywhere starving, a dog dies every 2 seconds.......and one gets hit by a car evry second.....sorry.....|`|Yvdg31WGaa	A Dogs noes is Very Sensitive. Even touching a dog on the noes can hurt the dog. You might want to inform your friend this as soon as possible. You are right he is risking the relationship he has with this dog. This dog won't even understand why on earth his owner is giving him a hit on the nose.... That dog is probably thinking what the heck why did you just hit me!?! I would be thinking the same thing. If he doesn't let the dog "go potty" out side then he might "go potty" in the house.     It is possible to teach an old dog new tricks... but i really don't understand what your friend is trying to teach this dog and i bet the dog has No clue either. The Trick to teaching an old dog requires repetitive tactics. For a Dog Words speak louder than Actions. The word No makes more sense to a dog then a hit. Hitting will confuse the dog and is most likely hurting this dog.   Talk to your friend about this... I'm sure he isn't trying to hurt his dog.

3tSMTwGraa	None of the above work. I like to go jogging in my neighborhood sometimes and I was attack by dogs before so I can help you. It is ridiculous to carry a stick with you at all time because it is not confortable to jog with it. A knife will not be effective because you have to get very close to the dog and take the risk of injury yourself. I recommend the Pet Trainer, it is small and effective from 20 ft away. Only dog can hear at this frequency and he minds. You can shoos dog away. I tried it and it works.|`|YoK7G6YFaa	Play dead.|`|SQKSJ6Uyaa	ill stay still but if it attacks me, ill use my best judgement to poke its eye out...|`|zbQzbyKAaa	None. Kicking him will only make it mad. Dont run. Hide ure hands, stick up your knee so it ends up hitting your chest, and elbow it.  Trying to use your hands will just get them bitten.|`|yENDQ3vDaa	Always carry a pocket knife and stab the dog|`|ctiKoGGfaa	1) know how to read a dogs body language (Brenda Aloff, "Canine body language.  2) Turn away from the dog and stand still  3) If it continues to charge, get down on all fours and cover your head with your arms.  4) NEVER run from a dog.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	My answer wasn't in your choices...sorry.  I wouldn't look him in the eye, but I would point a stern finger and gesture "NO, BAD DOG, NO!  I would say stay, sit firmly and walk away softly and keep looking back.  I'd keep repeating "stay".  If he was eating me, I'd strangle his butt, kick his sensitive spot,   I'm kind of a dog savant, it would never happen unless they were rabid or a trained killer.    If he seemed responsive to my commands, I might even let him sniff my hand, not going all full eye contact but with soothing tones.  After we bonded, I'd tell him "go home baby", which he would not want to do, but I would increase my intensity and volume and point.  Or, if I contained him to where I felt comfortable, I would put him in my laundry room, cell phone the Humane Society and comfort him until they arrived.  If he had a collar I'd call the owner.    I was bit by a dog once..a psycho poodle who actually jumped out of the open window of a moving car to attack my dog and I picked up my dog and he bit me.  He lived in an apartment in another country down the street and we'd walk our dog and for over a year, this dog would bark himself into a frenzy when my dog, who thought it was funny and didn't pay attention, walked by.  Because it was another country, everyone freaked out about rabies, etc.  Fortunately, he was vacinated.      You didn't give very good choices, but if he were really violent and it were a him or me situation.  I'd have to kick him..|`|rIFqv8nvaa	B will work cuz dogs dont climb trees, but i wud kickem in the throat.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	None of the above.    1. Running away = will provoke a chase.  2. Climb a tree = you'll be stuck up a tree unless you have someone to distract the dog.  3. Staring = that's a challenge.  4. Play dead = won't stop a dog from taking a few chomps out of you.  5. Kick him = You'll just aggravate the situation.    Best thing to do is consult a dog trainer to see what they'd recommend as the best action if approached by a potentially dangerous dog. They would know a dog's actions more than most. Many have schooling in dog behavior and will know what would be the least provoking/most successful.|`|zTSZgP3jaa	Strays don't often charge unless provoked they're more likely to run from you. But if any dog does charge you run, if you kick them they'll keep attacking you. B will also work but you'll be stuck up there.|`|vMXk9ohSaa	The first thing you could do is act like you are going to attack him.  Wave your arms and yell and look real mean.  If that does not scare him off - and I mean immediately - and he is still charging at you and growling and showing his teeth, then you should be prepared to defend yourself to the death.  Some of these dogs can literally kill you with all the biting.  Scream as loud as you can while fighting him off and hopefully someone will hear you.  If you know of a dog running loose on the way you have to walk (home from school, etc.)  call the police or animal control to come pick him up before you get bitten.  Carry a big stick and don't be afraid to use it - hard.  If one were around here acting like that, I'd tell my spouse and he'd sit out in the yard waiting for it with his rifle.  (And I'm not kidding.  Those big dogs are dangerous and should be kept fenced up.)|`|rlayqcGjaa	I would kick the **** out of him.|`|JwjFV5Uhaa	climb up a tree! LOL|`|BhXOLas1aa	none of those, what you do is remove all eye contact, carry a water pistol and shoot it with the water. It will gt the shock of it's life and soon forget all about you.|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	Never run from a predatory animal, as it will only cause it to chase you. A dog trainer recommended to me to get a boat horn(looks like a can of soda with a horn). That will also scare muggers and other baddies. What worked for me was staying calm and telling the stray dog in a loud firm voice to go home. And yes, it worked.|`|52fd570d1bb27415c767651c670966e2aa	None of the above.....    The best is to fold your arms across your chest look up and stand perfectly still if you do not move he will quickly loose interest in you as    You are not looking at him to provoke a challenge  You are not running away to look as pray or fun to chase  Kicking him will only make him defend himself.    Or carry pepper spray and hope that it just does not anger the dog more when you spray him.|`|AA12034021	It kind of depends.  Can you outrun him?  Probably not.  Maybe, however, you can at least make it to somewhere safe before he catches you.  So running may be an option.    Climb a tree.  I don't think dogs can climb, so this is a pretty good idea, if it is an option.    Stare him down.  Really bad idea.  Staring to dogs is a challenge.  You are daring him to attack you.    Play dead.  I really doubt this would work.  If he is going to charge you, as opposed to growl at you and show his teeth and similar threatening behavior, he's not going to fall for your playing dead bit.    Kick him.  Hmm.  Do you think you can take him?  You may get bit in the process.  If the other choices aren't an option, this may be your only resort.  Don't forget, if there is an object laying around that you could pick up with your hands and use as a weapon, that might be even better.  If the dog is violent enough and not going to back down or run away when you kick or hit it, you may well have to choke it to death.    There was a woman in Council Bluffs, Iowa (U.S.A.) yesterday that was attacked by an aggressive dog (loose, though not a stray).  She is 90 years old.  A guy driving by in a truck stopped to help her.  He tried pulling the dog off of her, and hitting it to make it go away, but it would not back down, so he had to take out a pocket knife and stab it to death.  Sad, but he didn't exactly have a lot of options (and letting the aggressive dog attack the lady was not an option).|`|Mf4tXuHQaa	Well im not too sure, but here are my answers.  a. Run away: If you run away, the dog will usually chase after you, or if you run far away enough, it may think that you are out of its territory and eventually give up, but usually it chases you.    b. Climb a tree: If you climb a tree you may save yourself for the time being, but the dogs might not give up though, and so you would have to stay in the trees for quite a while, unless the dogs find something better to do,  which might take a bit of time. Otherwise, you might have to try get some help from a nearby, or with a mobile phone.    c. Stare him down: Do not stare a dog in the eyes. this is like challenging them and take it as a threat. They may become even more aggressive, which I am sure is not a good thing.    d. Play dead: I think this is the best action. It's not necessarily properly "playing dead", instead stand still, with your head down and let the dog sniff you as it wants and when it loses interest, it will walk away, seeing as you are not a threat.    e.I think that you should definitely NOT kick the dog, this makes you and immediate threat, and instead of making the dog be scared of you, it will try to fight back, and you may get seriously injured.    So...yeah, playing dead IS probably the best option.. :)

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	If he is showing aggression on leash when people come close that is not him being protective, he is showing fear aggression.  When he is off leash his behaviour changes because he knows he can escape if he needs to.    If he is barking when strangers come into or near your yard he is doing what most of dogs do.    Best you take your dog to obedience training.  It will teach you how to train him and also will give him confidence.|`|NlvghuIkaa	This is just a stage Elroy is passing through. As he is maturing into that older puppy-hood, he is now starting realise who he really is in the pack and the duties he has to behold. Protection is not a bad thing.     Aggression is when you need to make a move. It is quite easy to understand that territory plays a big part when it comes to dominance. Once that particular dog has left the yard, he is out in the open and that sudden "fight drive" has disappeared.    Before this problem continues to reach points where he has gone completely over the top, you need to start with obedience. We often use what is called a "release word". That lets the dog know that they can go ahead or that something is ok.. including people. I would also suggest a quick trip to the vet for a short neutering appointment. This can halve dominance, aggression and high protection levels.|`|zTSZgP3jaa	Tell him NO, be stern about it. They can be very stubborn and if not trained otherwise can be impossible to get them to stop. They'll also be very annoying to everyone else.
FBGRvnuKaa	That depends.  Has the cat eaten a kibble diet its whole life?  Do you have reason to suspect kidney damage?  Is he/she drinking a lot more water than usual?  Vomiting?  Bad breath?    If your cat has been on kibble its whole life I would say start looking for possible symptoms at 10 years old or earlier.  Kibble does your cat's kidneys no favors and is widely thought to be the main cause of CRF in cats.      If your cat has eaten all commercial canned food its whole life then you're probably good until 15 years old or better.  Grains are inappropriate cat food and cause undue stress on all the organs, but at least canned food contains moisture that the kidneys need.    If your cat has eaten a prey model or whole prey diet its whole life CRF really isn't a concern.  Skip CRF testing unless you see symptoms.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	There really isn't a crf test. They give a regular blood test that tests for all sorts of things. The bun and creatinine among other things help determine if a cat has crf.   blood tests should be done occasionally to see what type of problems may crop up.    Since this is something you are concerned with, I hope you are feeding a good diet that is appropriate for the species. That would mean NO dry foods|`|jKMH27gKaa	Never. If it's indoors, all you need to get it are FRVCP shot (sp?) annually, and maybe a rabies in case they get outside. No FIV/kitty leukemia is necessary on indoors cats. I believe vets will only test for renal issues if they are showing symptoms of it.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	CRF is a very common disease among older cats. Some experts say screening for kidney disease should be done annually after the age of seven because symptoms are very hard to spot until the disease has progressed quite a bit.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	They say it's good to start having blood tests done on your cat when they reach senior status (which, as someone already said, is considered to be 7 years, I believe).  Blood tests can spot early symptoms of things other than CRF, too.    I wish I had reguarly screened my senior cat, for I didn't notice anything was amiss until she was in a serious emergency.  The symptoms onset so gradually and so slowly, and are so often mistaken for just "being old" that it's usually the case that people don't know until it's serious.  My girl was diagnosed a month before her 16th birthday and is now almost 17.  I'm on a CRF yahoo group, and it seems like most people on the list have 10+ y/o cats, but there are some who have seemingly young cats with it, too (4,5,6,7..).  That seems pretty uncommon, though.  I think if you want to wait til age 10, you should be ok.
YnCUyvK7aa	Yes, salt will affect plecos.  I'm not sure if he's the fish you're referring to as the algae eater, or if there's another algae eater along with the pleco.    But in addition to the salt, the 15 goldfish will produce a lot of ammonia from their wastes, and so will your cichlid from eating them.  If you can, test your tank water to see what the ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are.  As the ammonia in the tank increases, a bacterial bloom will occur, and this can make the water cloudy.    BTW, feeder goldfish aren't a good choice for feeding to other fish.  Goldfish have a higher fat content and aren't very nutritious.  And you have the possibility of introducing any diseases the fish have to your own fish by letting them live in the tank.  Cichlids are prone to getting hole-in-the-head from poor diets with lots of live feeders as their primary foods.  These should be limited to *treats* and the main foods should be a good quality pelleted food, worms, crickets, and/or mealworms.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	WHY ???? That's my main question. Why would you go and feed your prized fish and member of the family feeder goldfish ????  Would you go scoop up road kill off the street and cook it for dinner ??   Cus that's basically what you did to your fish sorry to say.  The feeders sold at even the cleanest pet stores are laden with disease and intestinal parasites which by your fishes actions, I can almost with 100 % certainty say he's has now.  Plus feeder fish have NO nutritional value just a little bit of protein that's not even noticeable. If you want to give your fish live feeders for variety breed some guppy's yourself, that's the only way. Otherwise just feed him different frozen and pellet foods. Every Single keeper of Cichlids will tell you the same, that is if they know as much as I do lol.    They have special medicines at the fish store for these parasites and salt isn't going to do a darn thing for it. F.Y.I. for you too, your local fish store employee is a moron, he/she doesn't care about your problem or is retarded if you told him this same story and he told you just add salt. Not gonna do a darn thing for a bacteria or internal parasite.  Read this link and see if you can't figure out what he has as far as illnesses with visible signs, if none of these fit the bill its internal.  http://badmanstropicalfish.com/fish_pala...    As far as the salt and the Pleco, Plecos are very sensitive to both salt and mediations. Any salt added to fish tanks, especially those with plecos in them needs to be dissolved with a bucket of tank water and added over the course of a day not all at once. Just let him adjust to the shock of the salt you just put him threw and he should settle down. A high salt Envoirment will kill him over time though.     As far as the cloudiness, if your tank has been cycled fro some time and you do 30 % of the volume of the tank water change weekly you must be overfeeding. Or somehow caused the tank to go threw a mini-cycle by cleaning too much or tanking out too much water.     Its hard to say really because SO many mistakes can be made when your not as informed as you should be. Good Luck with your treatment though and feel free to E-mail me if you have any other questions or need anything clarified.|`|AraBfesHaa	Plecos don't tolerate the salt,  you need to take it out of there temporarily.  That's why you're not supposed to feed live fish to your fish.  If they are suffering from, or carrying a disease, your fish will get it.  Just not a good idea.  But please get the pleco out of the salt water.  I had two die before I learned I was killing them by adding salt into the tank.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	I'd recommend shortening this whole thing if you're interested in good responses. Even the nerdiest fish lovers of all people would get lost and say "I dunno."|`|WBopwqTGaa	for one your reapeted the whole thing three times lol i read through it   and second yes remove the pelco and hold him in a second tank until you see your fish is getting better.  remember some feeder fish come with fin rot or swim bladder infections and can be harmful to your fish witch sucks i know  but try and look for discolouration in the feeders or odd swimming behaviour when you first buy them then take thos ones out and hold them in a diffrent tank to see if they die or grow ich,fin or tail rot and show symptoms of finbladder infection if they do dont feed them to your fish throw them out!|`|QyP0hDkJaa	Fish can carry lots of bacteria and whatever so yeah that could be why. Also he might have indigestion after eating those fish so quickly!
d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	Okay, clean where he does poop VERY good so he can't smell it and start over fresh. Pick up the pieces of poop and put it in the litter box. Now, with the cage clean, put stuffed animals in the corners that he likes to go potty- if he moves them, then clip them to the cage by putting a hole through it's back and hooking it to the cage bars with a shower clip. (the stuffed animal- not the ferret!) Usually ferrets don't like pooping on their bedding, so they won't go there.     And, do you put wood chips in the cage or blankets? If wood chips, he might think that they are litter, too, and not know the difference. If you just give him blankets ( which you should), then that shouldn't be a problem.    What kind of litter box do you use? If it's higher than maybe 2 1/2 inches, then he might be having trouble getting into it and doesn't see the point in going to all that trouble just to go into the box. Good luck!    Oh- what kind of cage do you have? I know with my Ferret Nation 142, my ferret needed to have 2 litter boxes because she couldn't go very far when she had to go and if there was only 1 box in the cage then I would have 10 poops to pick up.|`|6Z29aDnjaa	Well first you will need to get some of the poop and put it in the litter box. Then clean out the cage and the places it has pooped where you don't want it to poop. Get some ferret deodorizer and scrub them corners. Put the litter pan back in the cage, and keep an eye on where your ferret poops and pees. If it does use the bathroom in one of the other corners, then move it to the litter pan. You may want to even put down a ferret/puppy pad down so it will be easy to clean. Your ferret may also choose to use the bathroom in a different corner, if that happens then just move the litter pan.  I hope this helps|`|GqTSa85daa	Maybe the litter box smells strange to him, also they like darkened areas.|`|wJtm5krFaa	When you clean the litter box, leave some pooh in the corner..    if worse comes to worse, get more litter boxes and start putting them in a few more corners..    he or she might be having stomache problems and may not get to the home box in time|`|VrFanuD8aa	i had the same problem with my ferret, he may just like other places in your house/apartment and may go on something soft like clothes or shag rugs.|`|bepZupAfaa	if you have only had your ferret for a couple of months or so the problem might be that you could be over cleaning the litter pan. emptying it daily or every couple days is great but don't wash it with cleaning products as this destroys the smell that he is use to smelling in the litter pan. if i scrub my pans my ferrets tend to miss the pan a lot so i don't wash it out but a couple times a month.     each time you see him going outside of the litter pan just put him back into the litter pan. place poo that is on the outside of the litter pan in it this should draw him to use the pan.      have you changed litter? if so this could also be why he is not using his litter pan. go back to what you were using before ( not a clay,crystal or clumping type).    i have 5 ferrets and i use feline pine because they wouldn't use the litter pan with ferret litter or yesterdays news. i even mixed the two together but they wouldn't use it. so now i just use the feline pine and they use it 90% of the time.       if the pan that you are using is too tall he won't use it. to much trouble to climb in it. try a smaller pan but not to small.  a regular sized cat littter pan is usually about the right size.    you can move the litter pan to areas that he is going, put news paper down in the cage, or line with puppy pads to help with the cleaning.    hope this helps and good luck
YpEswTQdaa	In what way?    Feeding sugary foods,can decay their teeth,as i can with ours. Generally they can't,their teeth are ever growing(Called Open-Rooted)--so they don't lose their teeth,as we do,or even dogs/cats do!    Hope that helps,xxx|`|XI2iylR4aa	I don't think that's normal!  If that happened to your rabbit, maybe the tooth broke?  I would call a vet.
YpEswTQdaa	Hi,    Rabbits generally live for 6-8yrs,although up to 12-14yrs is still known.    --Fact--    The oldest Rabbit lived to 18yrs & 10 months!    Guinea Pigs(Cavies) on average live for 4-7yrs,however up to 11yrs is still known.  --------------------------------------...  Although rabbits can make it past 10yrs,when it gets past 5-7yrs,it start to slow down a bit,rather than Binkying & playing as much as it used to. Guinea Pigs become more old-aged like at 4+ years,although some i have had slow down at 5-6 years!    Hope this helps,xxx|`|wqho1WLgaa	Rabbit 8-12yrs. Guinea Pig 4-8yrs.

wF52XMxAaa	Do that, and he'll learn that "bang" means "I'm going to pick you up and put you on your back".  Not quite what you had in mind.    You might want to look up clicker training.  see http://bestinflock.wordpress.com/2008/09...  Probably get the book by Melinda Johnson, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890948...    Note that clicker training is somewhat controversial.  Some people say they can train better/faster without one - it's just a method of giving your bird feedback.
LDdd6uAQaa	rabbits have 2 peg teeth behind the top 2 incisors. This is normal.  You should get your rabbits teeth checked at least 1-2 times a year. This is because there is a huge amount of problems with malocclusion and molars over growing causing spurs on the back teeth of pet rabbits. This is more common with rabbits that have not been given a good diet, inbred rabbits and rabbits over 4 years of age.  This i know through experience.|`|nKwcGLQraa	they should look liek this: http://www.hrss.net/aar/health/images/go...    as long as your rabbit can eat without any problems, then its fine.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	yes he will have more than tht they are just small so you don't see them  but you can see the front btton teeth and front top teeth,  it is normal!   but i wouldn't worry about it just make sure he has lots to chew on like wood or toys because their teeth grow really fast and if they get too ,long it becomes painful for them, alterantivly you could get then filed down by the vet but it will cost as much a routine check up (in most vets) and you might not want to pay this lol!  :D  xxx|`|N04cJNeKaa	actully rabbits have 28 teeth but they are tiny the vet said so he put pics up too...when ur pet yawns you will se little bumps on his gumms|`|apTmBRlFaa	if your worried take him to the vet, also rabbits teeth grow constantly (and very quickly) so they need stuff to chew on. you can buy chew sticks, mine dont seem to like the chew toys, otherwise do what i do and cut (or brake) a couple of branches off of any friut tree, (apple and pear is best) then let them hew on this. it works well and is so much cheaper!!! lol if you live near me you can have osme of my branches for free!    you can also give htem carrot un cut and apples this helps!  hope your bunnies fine!|`|OBW6nzkLaa	i dunno if that is normal  you should take it to the vets to see if there is anything wrong .x|`|RCsLrFEXaa	Choice is yours !  take him to the dentist or just ask the flipping rabbit !|`|CL5VIiELaa	Take your rabbit to the vets for a checkup, then ask them.   :)
7BqOnBa8aa	Yes, all types of lettuce are safe for dogs.     In the past, urinary bladder stones have been surgically removed and for some stones, surgery may be the only effective treatment. But for most stones, there is an alternative. In most cases, the stones may be dissolved by feeding a special diet with reduced amounts certain minerals and protein, or a special diet plus medication. Special diets work by reducing the mineral building blocks or urinary stones in the urine. These diets affect the urine pH and increase urination to help flush the urinary tract. To completely dissolve the stones takes 4-16 weeks, depending on the size and number of stones present. During this time it is very important that your dog consume nothing besides the prescribed medications and the prescribed diet. Otherwise, the diet will not work properly and your pet will be plagued with this condition longer than necessary. Follow your veterinarian's directions when feeding the prescribed food, whether for treatment or prevention. Although these foods may not look like your typical dog food, most dogs readily eat these diets and find them palatable. If your dog is one of the few that doesn't readily accept a new diet after two days, you may want to try the following:     Warm the canned diet to, but not above, body temperature   Hand feed the new diet for the first few days   Mix the dry diet with a little warm water and wait 10 minutes before serving   Over a 7-10 day period, mix the diet with your pet's former food, gradually increasing the proportions until only the new diet is being fed   Feed only the prescribed diet!   Do not feed meat, liver or other animal tissue, vitamin/mineral supplements, calcium supplements, breakfast cereals or vegetables.     Be patient, but firm with your dog. This is important. The success or failure of treatment depends to a large degree on strict adherence to the new diet.  I've never heard of a dog yet that actually starved to death with food in the bowl.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	you must consult with your vet about his diet in further detail because he requires some careful planning. a vet will be the best person to ask.|`|ja2UD973aa	As far as I am aware, any kind of lettuce is fine.    As for the crystals, I am always so torn about the vet diets.  The good thing about them is they are nutritionally formulated to address the problem and correct it.  The bad thing about these diets is that the ingredients are horrible (mostly corn and by-products), which can lead to other health problems later on.      Although I am not a vet, my job is related to animal nutrition.  My personal opinion is that you should attempt to get your dog to eat the prescription food only long enough for the problem to start correcting it's self, then get off of it as soon as your dog is on the mend.  Adding warm water and microwaving the food will help make it taste better.    As for alternative diet solutions for crystals, a canned food or raw meat diet is best.  The high water content in these foods helps to more evenly distribute proteins and minerals throughout the body, preventing them from collecting in critical areas like the kidney and bladder.  The addition of a cranberry supplement will help as well.  Cranberries and blueberries have natural properties that support urinary tract health.     If you choose to prepare food at home, I recommend a raw meat diet.  Cooking the meat cooks out vital nutrients and makes the food less nutritionally complete and less healthy.

Bn1EjmEHaa	The best way to make a parrot learn to speak is to be nice, friendly and loving to your parent. It should be playful with you.  Then follow the following steps:    1) At night, in a dark room, talk to your parrot.  2) Repeat one-syllabi words over and over again, like his / her name or any other word considered easy to pronounce.  3) Be soft, gentle, kind and loving when talking to the parrot.  4) One day you will be surprised when your parrot will repeat what you were trying to teach it.  5) Once it starts picking words, then there is no stopping. When it hears a word repeatedly, it will repeat the same...........    NOTE: Take care not to talk rubbish or discuss your secrets in front of your parrot. It will blurt-out the same in front of others.....|`|Bv7borJ1aa	Dear vsp,  There is a VERY easy way of Training Birds Please get these Things.  -Tape recorder ($20-30) OR Microphone (starts from $2-250)  -Computer (Laptop OR skip to section 2)  Record yourself saying "Hello" Leave it On for 2 Days After that or even 24 hours (if you have a lovebird or Parrot) they will Pick it up and Start to get Better Then after that START to use Bigger Powerfuller Words for your Parrot to start to SPEAK YOU MUST TRAIN IT. it must be hand trained and friendly trained After Here are some Other Things to Say in Proper Order    -Hello *Your name After*  -Dude What's up  -Want to Play (More information on this at the END)  -i want Food (Needs EXTRA training)  -i feel sad  -i feel happy  -i feel scared  -Hello i am *Birds name* How are you Today i am feeling Good can you give me some Food? (Train after all Other words trained)    I STILL have not trained my Bird to Speak (Rare Green Love Bird)    I have had my bird for 1 week or less and its hand Trained!   I am going to Teach it to Speak using this Way|`|AA10381723	keep on saying one word over and over again I sure it will pick up|`|2bZMxMitaa	Start with one syllable words and repeat them over and over and over again.|`|s0UbZ7vsaa	talk to it as much as you can, like, say hello for a number of times,   they'll eventually mimic you and learn to speak|`|5Ws933gTaa	leave a tape with people talking playing when you leave the house.|`|wLahHcRgaa	keep repeating simple words like "hello" and "achoo". My parrot can say "hello" "squishy" (its name) and "achoo" i just keep repeating it over and over again eveytime i see it. nothing else or it will confuse it or soemthing. So stick to a couple words at a time. good luck! and teach it to dog whistle!! mine can and its so cute!
dO0cb4yBaa	You can't really make a parrot speak. Some do and some don't. Even African Greys (which are usually very good talkers) sometimes don't talk at all! I wrote an article about teaching parrots to talk. You might find some useful information in it - Look Who's Talking - http://www.infosuperflyway.com/articles/...

Even with a talkative bird like an African Gray it may be some time before it will talk.Do not use  records that repeat words because it stresses the bird. Just keep talking to him and say Bye every time you leave the house for example and eventually he will talk.
A9j7ahwsaa	sounds to me they are both followers and you are the dominant one. if you weren't the leader and one of the dogs was you would know. for one thing they would fight over the bones. dogs will clean each other even if one is dominant. i think you can pat yourself on the back you are the pack leader and your dogs are well behaved! congrats.
AA11457471	I went through this just a short time ago. I truly feel your pain.   My cat couldn't tolerate the meds at all. I even tried it in an absorbable gel but no matter how it was given it caused vomiting. The homeopathics didn't help, either.  At 2 lbs. your cat's body is ready to start shutting down if it hasn't already. I'm sure she's having difficulty maintaining her body temperature.  If she were mine, I'd end it now before she really starts to suffer. I'm very sorry.  Best wishes.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Yes she can be saved. You are obviously not giving enough meds and not getting the tests needed to determine how much she needs. Blood tests have to be done occasionally to see what is going on. Get the meds right, get the weight back up to a safe level then get the radio iodine treatment which is a 1 time treatment and will take care of the problem|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Ask your vet.She may need to have her medication increased.You can also feed her Nutri-Cal and baby food,but if her heart has been affected,it may be time to say good-bye.Please stay with her if you have her put down,so she won't be afraid.    Edit: 17 is very old for a cat,and if she is that weak,she may be telling you that she is ready to go.It is entirely up to you at this point,but it sounds like she is getting ready to pass on her own.|`|v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,     No, no, no. Thyroid disease is a really hard disease. I have a cat that has this very same condition. He was losing weight like no other, and he got really skinny. We started feeding him EVO wet and dry food, but more so the wet. He has gained his weight back and doing OK. He is healthy and happy at this point.     Thyroid disease speeds up kitties metabolisms so they have to eat higher in take calorie food, and eat more often in the day and at night. This is because with this disease, if you don't have a high calorie food diet, no matter what food they eat, it's like they're not eating at all due to their high metabolism. You need a food that will support that and that is EVO!      I give my cat EVO wet all day and three times before he goes to bed. He goes through about two cans a day, even sometimes three. These are the small cans, but you can buy the bigger cans. I don't shove food down him, I give hm small portions but throughout the whole day. It's like that of a human that eats 6 times in a day rather than 3. They don't stuff themselves, they simply eat less at these meals, but they eat them more often to stay stable. Does that make sense?     I would seriously try the new food and see what happens. At least give her a chance. I am sure you are as it sounds like it, but why did you wait until your kitty got to two pounds? That's not good, but don't worry, try the food and fast!     Feed EVO wet and dry all day, just in smaller portions but all day.     Hope this helps. Good luck. Here's EVO's website. www.evopet.com     I wanted to come back and tell you that my cay has kept his weight at a good and healthy weight ever since he started eating the EVO wet and dry food. He's done really well for over a year now. There is hope, you just have to keep trying and not give up. Hang in there, and start the EVO diet. Check the website out as it's a really good site.|`|GduRpnn0aa	I am assuming that your cat has Hyperthroid disease, and not hypothyroid disease? Your cat may becoming immune to her current medications which is resulting in her becoming more ill.     Hyperthyroidism is very common with middle-aged and older cats. It results when the thyroid glands (located near the cats windpipe) produce too much thyroid hormone.    Hyperthyroid pets often lose weight despite a normal appetite and become nervous, irritable and vocal. For several days, they may be hyperactive and have a rapid heart beat, then lethargic, apathetic and uninterested in food, play or grooming.     Thyroid imbalances are extremely common in North American pets. In cats, the problem is most often an overactive thyroid. In dogs, its the opposite: hypothyroidism (an under active thyroid) is much more widespread.    Symptoms of feline hyperthyroidism:    Hyperactivity, irritability, increased yowling   Weight loss   Increased appetite   Occasional vomiting or diarrhea   Poor quality (matted and dull) coat     If you suspect your cat has an overactive thyroid, you should consult your vet. Traditional treatments include radioactive iodine therapy, surgical removal of the thyroid gland, and ongoing treatment with anti-thyroid medications.    You should give her Resthyro, which is an effective natural treatment for feline hyperthyroidism. It contains a powerful combination of seven different herbal extracts. Together, they are very effective in treating feline hyperthyroidism:    Balances thyroid function (inhibits over-production of thyroid hormones)   Improves cardiovascular functions   Relieves tension and irritability   Improves digestion     An all-natural product, Resthyro has no adverse side effects and is safe for long-term use. http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-hyperthy...    I've personnaly used this product on one of my own cats and swear by it! Do not give up on your cat yet!

acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	My cat is going through the same thing and he is fixed just like your other cat. Has nothing to do with him fixed or not. Anyways...It seems as though your Cat is stressed.  Try to spend time with him while he  is in exile. Reassure him, pet him and give him treats. You need to let him know that you are back and that you are there for him Building trust will be a slow process.    First, thoroughly clean all places where your cat has gone to the bathroom to remove his  markings. Only then can you release him. It is possible that your cat may retrain herself. You might also want to consider getting a scat mat. However, it is also possible that your cat may not. If the latter is the case, have your vet look into placing him on anti-depressants. These may reduce his anxiety. These have been prescribed to many cats, dogs and other pets with good results.    Hope this helps|`|MfpOkIGbaa	Male cats, that are not neutered, will do this to mark there territory or because of stress.

Make sure there are two catboxes he can access easily, and use liners so they are easy to clean -- once the smell of pee gets into the plastic litter boxes, they don't like it. Be sure and scoop once a day, twice is ideal but definitely once a day. If you're already doing that, he may just hate the litter itself. I use Arm & Hammer with Febreeze clumping litter and the cats seem to like that. To avoid "spillage" over the side, get a hooded box; one with an open door so he can stick his head out of.|`|HEb9nQeFaa	You need to either litter train him or make him go outside. Keep a track on how often her needs to go, and when he looks like he's gonna pee, take him outside or put him on the litter tray. He will associate the peeing with the litter tray/outside. Good luck!! xx.xx|`|FCY3lwnoaa	If he used to use the box and just started the habit of peeing outside the box, you should know that 85% of the time that a cat pees outside the box it is because he or she has a urinary tract infection (UTI).    These can be very painful.  The cat associates the pain with the litter box and starts doing his business elsewhere.    Please, have your little guy checked for UTI by the vet ASAP.
PEPWFGNGaa	Hoofkind is a complete feed especially developed for laminitics. It should contain absolutely everything he needs including oiols and vitamins  http://www.horsehage.co.uk/MC-Hoofkind.h...    I think the problem you are having is that you are finding the feed too easy - I guess you are used to mixing supps etc in and it's just feeling wrong not to do that now.  Discuss it with your vet but I really doubt he needs anything else.|`|rEfiNabMaa	Buy a bag of 'Equilibrium'.  My horse had laminitis.. and i got a bag and it was honestly the best money i've ever spent. It is expensive (about $70 a bag) but it lasts about 10 months (so almost a year, and maybe longer for you as your horse is smaller) and the improvement is amazing. It is essential vitamins and minerals and it is designed by a vet.  It takes about 6 weeks to work but once it does you will be so happy.  My horse's coat has never been shinier, his feet have never been better and he has never been as much of an all-around happy and healthy horse.    Here are some before shots:  http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t12/k...  http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t12/k...

You can buy Equilibrium from most horse feed stores or online. The website is http://www.equiaustralia.com.au/    Hope that helped|`|OjeL1if4aa	Since he's already lamenetic... I suggest consulting your vet or local feed store representative to get a good idea on what he NEEDS and what you CAN feed him. You want to avoid hay like alfalfa and they can't get all their nutrients from just grass hay so he'll probably need supplements... but only your vet can tell you what he really needs and what won't hurt him.    Feed store reps are good because they know the quality and nutrients of the hay and can suggest proper supplements... though not all are knowledgable when it comes to laminitis.    It doesn't cost anything to ask a few questions or talk with your vet (at least it shouldn't!). It's better to be safe than sorry... I'm sure people with experience with lamenitic horses can suggest good supplements, but only your vet knows the extent of the damage and what would be best, feed wise, for the pony.    As with any complete feed you have to feed very high amounts daily to get be sure they're getting proper amounts of vitamins and minerals. According to the link in an above posting your guy, 14.2hh 880lbs (400kg), needs apporximatly 5lbs (2kg) of that feed per day to be getting everything he needs from the feed.    Good Luck!|`|AA11164207	Are you saying that that is the only supplement you could give him?what does the rest of his diet consist of,roughage,hay,grain,etc.usually a good hay/grain diet provides plenty of nutrients.however a performance horse or a horse that is worked hard requres additional nutrients.Judging by the name of the nutrient "hoof kind",sounds lke its function is to address hoof issues,is this true>i have not heard of it|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	No. Only feed what you have been told by the vet.  Prepared food will have sufficient vits and minerals to keep him going.  It is overfeeding a laminitic horse which can make them worse.  They literally need a starvation diet of some hay and nothing else!  He may or may not be fat but some horses and ponies are more suceptible to others and if he gets it later in life, as mine did, he could have Cushings Disease.  This shows as a long curly coat in summer and a great thirst.|`|hjLe1SRjaa	umm purina makes really good feed... if you go to the local feed store they should be able to help..  i work at one and i would try n help but depending where ur at in the world depends on his diet|`|PbnpvkIyaa	As long as you are feeding a high quality feed and hay, I don't think that a supplement is required.

gJBqAXwtaa	you need to try to get her to vets, even if it does take a whole day to get her in the box,  she is getting really bunged up and it's really not good for her, if your mushing the food up really small for her then i doubt it is the food she's eating, she would digest that.  it's just contipation so you need to get tablets from your vets as soonas possible this seems like it has been goin gon for a while, so you should get her seen to quickly it will just get worse.  you could try some home remidies like rice and chicken mushed up to get her bowels moing quicker, if this doesn't work get the tablets.  i am not a vet but i am training to be a vet, and as know one else answered i thought i might be able to help.  she is still pooing little amounts which is good at least she is getting it out somehow.  good luck|`|v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,     I am not a vet, but I doubt the way she eats has anything to do with this problem. My cats have had teeth pulled and even one has no teeth, but still eats OK and none of them have this problem.     It sounds to me like your cat is obviously constipated and can't go to the bathroom. She is plugged and needs to see a vet.     I don't know what to tell you about the carrier thing, as mine dislike it too. I have to actually un-screw my carrier screws to take the top off, and have another family member gently hold my cat in the middle of the carrier as I am screwing the screws to the carrier top back on. I basically have to take it apart and then put it back together, but with him in it.     He is actually more calm this way, he's not as frightened. Hope this helps. I also sprinkle cat nip around it to help calm him down. Cat nip usually relaxes kitties.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Hello, if youur cat doesnt want to go to the vet then phone your Vet and ask them if a vet could come to your house and check her over.

gJBqAXwtaa	Chihuahua Breeder-  I also have 2 teacup chi's at 4lbs!! and a larger one at 5lbs!! :D  i would say the most your chi would have is 3 at the VERY most  they would normally have 2 or maybe 1.  so don't get worried thinking your gonna have loads of pups they are small dogs themselves and they will have small pups  my chihauhua had 1 pup the first time but she couldn't pass it because it got to big in the womb , then she had 2 the second time but unfortunatly 1 died in the night, it's sad but some pups don't make it passed the first :(  size does depends on it your right a bigger chi would obv. have more pups baceuse she can carry more!  good luck with the pups i hope all goes well!    edit* well people call very small chi's teacups!!  and you could have a scan done but it is expensive and there is always a risk that it is bad for the pups inside, they are normally fine but it's not good for them, your vet will tell you the same thing.  cesearean's are expensive to my chi needed one and it cost 750, but it was worth it but just be prepared.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	You can have her scanned at the vet to find out how many puppies she is carrying, your vet needs to be aware of when she is due to whelp as Chis are not easy whelpers - hopefully you have some money put away to cover costs for an emergency caesarean if necessary.  There is no such thing as a Teacup - something I would expect a reputable breeder to understand.  http://www.the-british-chihuahua-club.or...|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	i have many chihuahuas and firstly t-cups are just smaller pups from a litter. Not something to be pleased about, because usually they are the runt/smallest and have problems later on in life. Secondary you should not of mated a chihuahua of that size, she is too small, she is likely to need a c-section which will cost around 500+, so i hope that's not a problem. We don't breed chis of that size because they are hard to breed and many times the pups don't make it and a high change neither does the mum. Chis should be over the age of 2 years and more than 5 lb. A stud dog should be true to type and smaller than the bit**h.   But to answer your question chis can have one pup and i no chis that have had 7, both the average is 2-3, usually one won't make it, or very sadly non. I am concerned  that you havent had a scan to find out if they are ok and alive, your vet could tell you how many be ultra scan or x-ray. You should be able to feel her pups. Regarding time, you need to make lots, because mum may not self whelp which you are going to help her 100%, you will need to fed the pups or guide mum and stay with them including night time for the first 4 weeks of pups life. Not forgeting the 2 weeks before she is due to whelp. Was her mum a self whelper! You need to do a lot of research so you no what to expect and to identifly what is wrong and when to call the vet in. This is a very sad time for the bi**ch if she has no support or guidence. Lots of hard work, money and time is required.  I would call the bit**ches  breeder to see if the mum was a self whelper as this will help your vet closer to the time, and they will be able to talk you through the process, can take a long time, especailly in between pups.|`|O7G7E8gAaa	well my dear if you haven't got the time, why breed her in the first place. Many chis die because they are breed to people you are clueless, they are not good self-whelpers and usually don't make it, i hope you now spend a lot of time finding out about whats going to happen, and i really don't me on answers!    Just to say a t-cup chihuahua is breeder who has no idea about chis or just want a lot more money for a smaller chihuahua, they are runts of a litter, usually later in life have problems. They certainly should not be breed. Breeding a chi of that size is just asking for death.|`|bIaywrBCaa	4.5 lb is a normal size chi. Plus there is no such thing as a teacup chi. A chihuahua will usually have 1-4 pups, sometimes they will have more but it is ususally the larger ones that have the most. You could have an xray done/

I don't know what to tell you other than have her spayed ASAP so she doesn't need go thru a C-section.|`|1i8HiHHeaa	did you get your dog from a responsible breeder? if so, i would contact them & let them know the problems you're having with her & ask for their advice. a good breeder will want to know what's going on with their pups & may offer a guarantee against genetic defects.|`|SIKCfUtjaa	welcome to the life of owning a pet.. i work to pay for my animals is the way i see it.  if you got the dog from a reputable breeder then you should have no issue with them either helping with the cost or getting you a healthier puppy. but if you didnt then you have to put up with the costs that come with owning a breed of dog that is prone to eye problems, skin problems. back and hip problems...|`|hy32mGg2aa	You should try having our westie!!!!!!|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Well, as for the cherry eye, take her back to the vets and ask if they can show you any techniques to massage the tear duct to help prevent blocking in the future. I rescued a bulldog once that had cherry eye. I did not want it removed as this can cause dry eye, a more serious problem, but a very good breeder friend of mine taught me a technique that prevented against any more prolapses.     I will not describe any techniques of this nature online or over the phone as you can cause damage and injury if not done properly, so please ask your vet.    As for the rest of your dogs health, I would say the best thing you can do is prevent against future health problems.    With Bulldogs, this means regular cleaning of the skin folds on the muzzle and if the tail is tightly wound, cleaning that too on a daily basis. Use a lukewarm clean water and once weekly, add a teaspoon of hibiscrub and make sure that when you have wiped all the folds, dry them thoroughly.    This will prevent bacteria building up in the moisture that is present in these skin folds.     Also, make sure the air quality in your house is good, make sure she is getting a good quality dog feed (all natural, no meatderivativess or unspecified animal fats or protein sources and no preservatives)    Another thing you could do is speak to a reputable and experienced Bulldog breeder to ask their advice as well. I am not an expert on the breed, just offering general advice on goodhealth caree, considering its known problems.
SXmlCXs4aa	She will find her own spot. She will also move the kittens somewhere you can't find them as easily probably at least once.|`|8CaOYfacaa	well where you set her nest for giving birth, and where she will give birth are 2 different things. Cats normally make their own nest, and when they give birth, they give birth.     I would find a quiet, warm place for her to have her kittens, and make sure its comfortable. If you can, watch her careful for going into labor( she will be pacing a lot, and act uncomfortable). If she disappears, make sure shes in the birthing nest, and then leave her be.  Dont bother her, otherwise she will harm the kittens.     Good luck!!!|`|AA12089784	u can try makin one but the cat will usually make there own|`|a46197f651f5c55f626c4c2af24c623daa	My cat once had kittens on my bed.... when I was sleeping!!  Another time she had kittens in a lower dresser drawer.    although you can make her a place to have the kittens, she will pick her own spot and it may or may not be the spot you hope for.|`|R4YvRhsVaa	actually it doesnt really matter where you set the nest... my experiance has been that the cat will find her own place to give birth where shes most comfortable
8CaOYfacaa	The price of feeder lambs(which you would actually be marketing) depends on the time of year. Mutton(sheep/lamb meat) is very popular among ethnic groups all over the world.    So what you need to do is find a sales barn near you, and go on a day they have all animals. This will give you a broad range of prices for selling sheep.    Call a local Vet, and ask if he knows where to find a Stockyard that buys animals to be shipped out.     I live in Northern MN and we went to South St. Paul, MN to ship our Feeder calves and Feeder lambs.  I found fall was the best time to sell the lambs. They are young enough to handle travel, and the demand is a lot higher.     Now lambing, if ya need to know, is best done in Mid-April to Mid-May. So you want to breed the sheep in Mid October-Mid- November.     Im not sure about the south, but the market for Sheep, and Boer Goats was real good.     If ya need more info, dont hesitate to give me a yell.|`|083d0886177b866f3b19289d61ec5ef9aa	Sheep are excellent for grazing when kept with cattle. The value of wool is very low all over the world and if you hire a shearer you'll probably only brake even. There is a lot more money in lamb meat. If you do want to raise them for wool try to find a specialist market, like hand spinners, to sell to. However the wool must be of top quality for hand spinners.    Another option is to raise haired sheep. They don't have to be sheared and are often more hardy, and less prone to fly strike then the wool sheep.    Ive worked with a small herd of easy care sheep (see the link below  its UK based), that were brought to manage grazing for horses with no intention of making a profit from them, but they are real money spinners, usually lambing twins or triples and very low maintenance.    http://www.easycaresheep.com/|`|bf20d1596a080a379eedb6a0fd53c31baa	Meat from a lamb is not mutton. Mutton is meat from a sheep no longer considered lamb. They are worth most in the fall. I agree with starting out with a small herd. We always kept 8 ewes and one ram. Sold the lambs for the most part each fall. No money in wool unless you are raising a special wool breed and sell to a spinner. I used to send mine to a place in Maine and they send you back wool ready to knit although not your own wool. It is very expensive to hire someone to spin it for you , I tried that as I do knit. They do provide a good profit margin though and are enjoyable to have around with the exception of a rowdy ram. We used to have lambs weigh around 90 lbs. by end of summer.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Is it blood as in RED blood, fresh blood? Or is it a sort of slimy brownish goo?   She shouldn't be bleeding red at all.. And she should be getting close to having anything at all coming out... Especially enough to be making a mess where ever she sits.   If the stuff doesn't smell bad, and isn't green or looking like something that is really bad, I would give her a few more days. But if it continues or there is a problem, I would take her in and have the vet take a look.|`|8CaOYfacaa	That is a long time to still be bleeding. I would call the vet and take her in, make sure there is no retained placenta, or infection going on.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Well she should not be bleeding so much as to get blood all over the place.  She should only have a clear to browish discharge by now.  I'd be concerned for her.  I would suggest to get her into the vets for a check to make sure no infection has set in.
2pvW4M8Aaa	A month old is very young to separate a kitten from its mother.  Usually you should wait at least 8 weeks.  If possible the kitten would benefit from being with its mother another month.|`|8CaOYfacaa	no, part of the seperation/weaning process, is taking it away from its parent.   Not always a pleasant experience weaning a baby from its momma.    What you can do, is put the kitten in a small box with a soft blanket, and a warm bottle(take a 2 liter soda bottle and fill it up with super warm water)....she will snuggle for warmth.  A stuffed animal may work, as would a rewinding alarm clock(the ticking helps).     If you want to...you can get bottles for feeding kittens and puppies at a local pet store. Get that, and some kitten formula(comes in cans called Kitten replacer, at walmart) and warm it up. She may be thirsty too, if she isnt 100% how to eat on her own.  Try this for a week or so, and she will bbe alright.     The kitten will be alright....it is seperation anxiety.  Try some of these things. :)|`|01dc2514948c98b68aad5db9fca8467caa	your kitten misses its mommy because it is not used to being away from her you just need to give it time and play with it and love it and give it all the attention you can give.. kittens want ALOT of attention.. over time you will see that the kitten will show you love like it showed its mom love and when you leave the house without it the kitten will meow for you like it does for mommy now.  you just need to give it time. the kitten just wants to feel loved and it wants alot of it.|`|a61dec6cd92dffa7ba4afc6be04b4946aa	More than likley your kitten is probably scared.  Try giving it some milk (you may even warm it up if you want), this will calm it down a little, and try giving it some food..Just cuddle and play with the kitten.  Go and buy some toys if you do not have any yet, becuase kittens love to play and this will help it calm it down.|`|Irt8114Oaa	I think this is pretty normal-give it time and the kitten with learn to trust you.   The kitty is a little young to have been removed from it's mother, but I wouldn't return it at this point.|`|EHvhtpoLaa	i think thats to soon to take away from mamma would you like it if you only knew your mother for a month IT WANTS ITS MOMMY|`|gDTNrBitaa	well a kitten 4 weeks old is usually still with the mother.I got two kittens a few weeks ago but they were 8 weeks old when i got them.

3vA69tmcaa	First of all, ferrets are very expensive (to purchase and care for) and high-maintenance pets but if you're willing to put the time, energy, and money into having ferrets, then they can be awesome pets! They are energetic, sweet, and funny little characters if you raise them right.    Ignore people who say they reek - ferrets only stink when they are not being properly cared for, just like any other animal. You must clean up after them daily! But don't give them baths often. Once every month at the utmost maximum because if you over-bathe them their skin will work overtime to replenish the natural (yes, musky) oils that you're washing away in the bath and result in a stinkier fert.    Keep a close eye on them and ferret-proof your home. They need to spend as much time out of the cage as possible! A minimum of 3 hours daily. More if possible. Ferrets are not animals to be kept in cages 24/7 like hamsters.  They will get depressed and diminish if you do not pay them enough attention. Also, they will be unsocialized and mean. This is where the stereotype that ferrets bite comes from.    Find a ferret-knowledgeable vet and make sure you get them their initial distemper vaccinations (and yearly as well) because they are extremely susceptible to distemper (you can bring it in on your shoes!) and it is 100% fatal. Also get its rabies vacc. because it will protect you and your ferret in case it should ever bite anyone.    Speaking of, you have to train ferrets not to bite from the beginning. As kits (babies) they nip and play but they are only *mean* if they are mistreated, neglected, or not properly cared for. There are many different ways to nip train and its up to you. Whatever you do, don't ever yell or strike a fert! If you decide to go ahead with getting a carpet shark it is recommended that you get at least 2 because they can play rough and bite and scratch with each other instead of you.    Also, a ferret owner is encouraged to start setting aside money for a "Ferret Fund." When they get older, they are likely to get sick and need to be taken to the vet for (often times) expensive surgery. This also ties into ferret-proofing because they will eat stuff that is not good for them and it can block their intestinal tract and that is expensive to remedy as well.    Your vet will tell you to give them laxative every few days. I use Laxatone and they love the taste! This helps with passing hairballs so they don't get stuck.    Read up on them as much as you can! I recommend www.ferretuniverse.com and "Ferrets for Dummies." Too many ferrets end up in shelters because owners don't recognize the commitment that goes into having one.    I love my 2 little fuzz-butts! They keep me occupied and entertained! If I'm ever having a crummy day I just watch them play! They are the best presents I've ever gotten.|`|ICBKpZeAaa	I found some good info here.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Here is a good site with lots of info about ferrets:  http://exoticpets.about.com/od/ferretcar...|`|AA11487557	Ferrets make wonderful pets but I must warn you that you may need to check local laws and make sure their allowed...the only two FULL states that dont allow them are california and hawaii. Other cities and counties may not allow them.    First of all...your friend isn't completely wrong about the lack of attention thing. They need a lot of attention..if you ignore them...they'l since your nonlove for them and may commit suicide. It is very simple to give them fun though...just MAKE sure you ferret proof your home...they are very curious and can't always get out of things they create...once your home is ferret proofed just let them loose...in your home. go to http://ferretanonymous.com for the local banneds and other useful papers. Hope this helps...and I recommend getting them spayed or neutuered to reduce their smell...|`|PmFYP2Zpaa	I went to the library and studied ferrets on the computer before I got mine (all from rescues).  You should see if there are any rescues in the area that will let you handle some before you make your decision.  They are great pets, but like everyone says, they are expensive to care for properly and do need LOTS of attention.|`|AA12285639	First of all...ferrets are not like cats and dogs.  Cats and dogs tend to be more independent then ferrets.  Ferrets require A LOT of interaction from either another ferret or their human owner.  They will not necessarily die if they are not given attention but they would be EXTREMELY miserable.  There is no sense in owning a ferret if you cannot devote daily attention to it.      As far as having cats is concerned its an 'iffy' situation.  You could NEVER let them alone together.  Just because your cats are sweet to you doesn't mean they wouldn't chase down a rabbit and kill it.  Cats are hunters and they like to hunt small animals.  This has nothing to do with temperament and everything to do with instinct.    If you are honestly serious about owning a ferret here is my advice:  Make sure you get 2 ferrets ESPECIALLY if you cannot provide a lot of attention.  Confine them to one room that is ferret proofed so you can let them run outside of the cage for most of the day.  Thoroughly read this website...it has lots of ferret information and is easy to navigate.  Read the WHOLE thing before even making your decision.  Ferrets are not "easy" pets to own.      Good luck with your decision!
4q5MxAgbaa	You should not take him for walks yet because of the risk of parvo.  Parvo can live just about anywhere.  You could even bring it into your house on your shoes.  Not putting him down seems a bit impractical though.  I would suggest simply removing your shoes when you enter your home.  Your puppy will receive a shot for parvo every month until he is 4 or 5 months old.  Try just walking him in your backyard if possible.|`|25d34bad960851c7a8372b05a73033daaa	no thats not true hell be fine as for training just go outside with him every two to three hours and let him do his business before you take him out it good to say something like"gotta go outside" so he knows the command|`|ZSesESvOaa	I don't think you can walk him but as I understood it you could take them out in your own yard to go to the bathroom. I am not a vet but I think the idea is to make sure they are not exposed to other animals especially if they don't have vacations|`|G9fdtR1Kaa	if ur puppy does not have his first shots then no you shouldn't take him out front because he could get parvol...from other dogs.    but i see nothing wrong wit taking him into your backyard if u have one.you said he had 2 shots already....was one of them his parvol shot??  if soo then yea u can def. take him out already for walks if u want to.|`|J7u63BJUaa	I just got a puppy a few months ago and the thing about the shots...you can take him out and put him on the floor.  His shots need to be completed within the first six months (get a puppy shot package).  He will be fine.  On training..I had a hard time with my puppy (pomeranian), but the only thing that worked was a training crate.  I know it looks terrible them being left inside this "cage", but it really taught him to hold it.  And when I came home I took him right out and within weeks-he was housebroken.  It took a little time to get the whole  2 goes outside too, but he caught on.  I left him in the crate when I was gone and at night in my bedroom.  When I was home I confined him to one room, but after he got the idea...he went everywhere.  It takes time, but be firm and you'll both be happy.    Good luck!|`|7Va2EVXAaa	There is the danger of Parvo but I never worried about it in my own yard or house.    You should be able to get all of his shots by 13 weeks.|`|uzs3Gpw4aa	buy him some puppysocks or puppyshoes they sell those in dog shops and take him out where there are no other animals no feces no garbage a clean place where you can clean up after him nd he can not eat or step on anything he finds. you have to be very carefull with puppies because parvo virus is the leading cuase of death with in puppies. always clean up after the puppies do not let him eat his own feces. good luck
51ccff84a2a7059f15bf5fd768bde0e4aa	take it to a pet store and let them do It.|`|KOX2J7uXaa	Yes, you can bring your dog to a groomer or vet to have it's nails trimmed, but you'll have to make an appointment and pay around $10.00. Or you could buy a pair of dog nail trimmers and cut them yourself. Don't worry if you accidentally cut one too short. It's not true that a dog will bleed to death. Just mix some flour with a little water and have it ready incase you should hit the dog's quick. You can take a dime sized amount of the flour mix and press it into the nail and the bleeding will stop. Trimming dog's with white nails is the easiest because you can see where the pink quick ends. Dog's with black nails are a little trickier but with practice it gets easier. Black nails are dull where the quick is and become shiny where the excess nail begins. Hope my advice helps. Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|J7u63BJUaa	Your vet will do it for free.  You can also get doggy toenail clippers and do it your self, but make sure you stay away from the vein inside the toenail.  If your dog has black nails (mine does) I recommend having a vet do it, but if the nails are clear, you'll be able to see the vein and trim below that.  Make sure you get really good toenail clippers, nothing cheap.  Here is a good buy-the Deluxe SS for small dogs they are from Petsmart (online or at store).  It costs $9.99.    Good luck!|`|Ea0rakOBaa	the most safest way for your dog would be to take him/her to your vet or a pet salon. they are professionals and would be the people most likely not to hurt your dog.  ?Good luck?|`|GNVGsrTTaa	It is best to have a groomer do this process.    If you choose to do it at home you will need the following items:  -Quickstop Powder, another brand, or cornstarch to stop the bleeding if the quick (blood vessel)is snipped  -A DOG nail clipper- the best are the Guillotine style or Miller's forge trimmers style. Look at your local pet store for either of these 2.    Are the Chihuahua's nails white or black. White are diffidently easier for me to cut.  If you look closely at a white nail, you will see a pink and white nail border. Trim ONLY to right before the pink.  On black nails, the tip is darker and the vessel area is grayish. Trim to that area. The excess nail is also slightly more shinier or metallic looking.  The easiest way to know when they are short enough is: on white nails you see a small pinkish-white dot in the middle; in black nails there is a gray dot at the end of the nail.    Go to a vet or groomer to help demonstrate. It is a fairly hard process. They will help you threw it.   Good Luck!    Also, if you do decide to go to a vet or groomer to do this. Please be careful, there are some really horrible people out there that cut way past the quick so the nails will be shorter! You will find a good groomer that you trust though; stay with that groomer when you do!|`|INmPiwnMaa	if it is snippy about this get a towel sit youre pup on youre lap and pin it softly with youre arm and snip. I always do min on my lap at work I like a harness and I will do it on a table but mine is a baby and she is mine so she is better on my lap|`|Sh6u3qfAaa	Get a new, sharp nail clipper  from the pet store.    Hold your dog in your lap or standing on the kitchen table.    Gently life one of his front paws and bend in back gently with the joint.    Hold the paw in one hand and hold out one nail, hold the clipper perpendicular to the nail.    Clip off just the tip, only 1/16 of an inch, just a little.    Do each nail that way, then go to the other front paw.    Then do each back paw in the same way.    If you are careful to do just the tip, you will not injure your dog. If you cut a little too deeply, then put a little cornstarch on the bleeding area to stop the blood.    If the dog is very small, you might be able to use a large toe nail clipper, but I don't recommend it.
73HQBcozaa	Whatever you do, don't scold him!  Start off where he can see you and leave him by himself in his crate or area (where you normally leave him) and ignore him until he is entirely settled down, then give him attention.  Repeat, each time moving further away -- out of sight, in a different room, outside, etc.  Every time you return do not pay attention to him until he is calm, no scratching at the door/gate, no crying or barking, but when he is being good, make sure that he knows it!  Give him treats and attention when he is being good and he'll very quickly learn that crying isn't the way to get what he wants.    Remember that dogs can't differentiate between good and bad attention, so scolding for them is a form of attention.  They don't know that what they are doing is 'wrong', they just know that it gets them a response.    Also, it helps for him to have things to play with like Kongs and Busy Buddy toys that you can put treats in and will keep him busy while you're gone.  My guy also loves bully sticks and Flossies.  One thing that also worked for us was called a 'Cuddle Puppy' and it has a heartbeat and you can put in a heating pad so he'll feel like he is with his mother.    Best of luck!  Schoodles are absolutely adorable!|`|oa0kotpTaa	Get a cat.|`|sJ8CVunTaa	He will get use to it.  you could turn on some music when you leave or the tv.  or talk loud to him if you are just right outside.  but I promise he will learn that you will be back soon.

It's just that he's not used to it. Reassure him you'll be back. When you come home, he'll give you a warm welcome.|`|HdIyRJqxaa	Well he might have to learn that crying is a no no when your gone. But that's only if you don't like it. Try leaving him and come back and praise him if he isn't crying, try scolding him if he is crying.|`|Sh6u3qfAaa	Try giving him an old, warm t-shirt with your smell on it. Also, give him a chew toy like a Kong to occupy him.     But don't make a big deal about leaving or about coming. If you will leave and return progressively for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and an hour, then he will learn to entertain himself, or to go to sleep in just a few days.

When they are dead they smell really bad.|`|7U0sPJ2saa	Make crab cakes.    http://teriskitchen.com/seafood/crabcake...|`|VFbOGwN4aa	maybe he is really bored, lazy to move. but maybe, you haven't gave some food, or haven't left it in a warm or cold place.. play with it and be active x] but if you tried putting water on it, or let it go and see if it moves.. but if it doesn't do anything.. i'm sorry, he is dead|`|UinOWcMUaa	Take him out and give him a good shake :)|`|dXcm5971aa	No, sometimes, Hermit Crabs are shy, that's all.
4170b6159b559adeeada7e5a240ebe71aa	its a yorkie/shi tzu mix. Look at the link below it looks just like it and that yorkie shitzu mix. And it looks about 5 years old but thats a guesstimate.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	There are alot of breeds in that dog. Looks like some of these...not all, just some    Shnauzer  Some sort of terrier (silky/australian/yorkie)  Maltese or Bichon Frize    As for the age check the teeth. If there really dirty he's old. IF the sparkly he's younger. Other than that you cant really tell. Take em to the vet|`|sOkePjK3aa	It looks like a mutt and I think it is part terrier. It has colors like a yorkie. You can take it to a vet to get it tested and they figure out what type of dog it is. On the age thing, it looks kind of middle aged, leaning towards the older side though. I'm pretty sure a vet can tell you approximately the age too. Hope this helped. Good luck figuring it out. :] BTW Cute pup. :}|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	He looks something like a Havanese. Age is difficult to determine from a picture. Can you check his teeth?|`|OBA3Iciraa	might have some terrier in there too.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	shih tzu - poodle maybe some yorkie mix too.|`|GKZPxAaPaa	Aww he's so cute! He looks like he has maltese and yorkie in him. Maybe even some jack russell if he's extremely hyper. Lol.    I can't tell how old he is. :(|`|2iRkXJ4oaa	Shih Tzu/Yorkie/Dachshund would be my best guess. And maybe around 2 years old. If his teeth are white and sparkly probably closer to a year (his gums would be pink) He might be a few years older if his teeth are worn down, yellow, and his gums would be duller.    Whatever breed and age though, he is extremely cute :)|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	hes a mutt...looks like a lhasa/yorkie X or something and he isa couple years old by the looks of him but i couldnt say for sure w/ o looking at his teeth|`|uIvb5eqoaa	he looks like a terrier mix.  My guess is he has some tibertian terrier in him, but I can't tell you his age.  Your vet can do a better job of that.  THere are DNA test you can get that tell you what breeds your mutt is made of.|`|AaoclPYCaa	He could be a lot of things.  He could be Maltese, Shih Tzu, dachshund, and maybe terrier.  He also looks a little like a Yorkie too.
hEXb1unraa	sweet, not the spicy one.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	The kind you bake with, from the store. That is the kind  I use.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I'm not sure, but there are a lot of other things in Black-as-Knight. It has other spices, oils, hay, and seaweeds. I've tried using paprika instead, and although it's a lot cheaper, it doesn't work nearly as well.
OA7cPgGNaa	I have 5 border collies. Four (2 females, 2 males) of them will herd livestock and there really is hardly any difference between them. The only thing I have noticed in all my years of training and experience has been the younger the dog (male and female) the more unpredictable they are. In a training ring they may lie down and away on command, but when out in a field they may get out of hand and single out a particular livestock animal and go for it.     But none of my four have been different. Now in just day-to-day aspects with temperament, the girls are usually more unpredictable in that one minute they are moody and independent and the other times they will be nudging you for attention.    I prefer my male borders. Their temperament is more even (they have infectious smiles and are love bugs). When performing (agility, fly ball, Frisbee) they are more consistent in their scores. My females vary day to day on how they do in the ring.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	No, I've had both  (ACD) and they work the same.

Growing up, I used to tease him that we went to the city pound to get a puppy, and Mom saw him and wanted to bring him home-we all wanted a sheepdog, but Mom insisted we get him instead.

I wonder if I could show it at a CKC sanctioned show?|`|uQfk8p7Laa	if you think about all dogs are mixed who do you think they get them type of breeds     there are 2 types of CKC honestly  I have a reg ckc(Continental Kennel Club ) chihuahua and he is a pure bred! i don't know nothing about Canadian Kennel Club at all! i do know about the Continental Kennel Club!   to reg anything type of dog both parents have to be reg with CKC and if not you can't reg your dog!       Canadian Kennel Club  Continental Kennel Club    i payed 18.00 cause i wanted an ID card for my chihuahua! and plus i payed 12.00 for a new member!   cause i got him from a breeder that breds just chihuahus she don't mixs her chihuahuas they are pure breds!     Does Continental Kennel Club register mixed breed dogs, and if so, why?    Yes, Continental Kennel Club does register mixed breed canines. Owning a mixed breed dog is very common, and CKC offers services for these dog owners. Many mixed breed canines are rescued from shelters by responsible owners looking to provide a good loving home for these dogs, and Continental Kennel Club encourages registration of these dogs for a number of reasons. CKC registration services provide proof of ownership, allows the dog to participate in our performance events, allows CKC to record the accomplishments of the owner and these canines, as well as the many other benefits of CKC membership.    Continental Kennel Club has designed its applications to ensure the public understands the different registration categories by stamping, PUREBRED or NONPUREBRED on puppy applications and registrations. Also, the abbreviation, MISC appears in front of any mixed breed description. In addition, the numbering system for miscellaneous breeds is different. Computer programs prevent the recording of a mixed breed registered dog as a purebred
OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed's friendly, tolerant attitude makes him a fabulous family pet, and his intelligence makes him a highly capable working dog. Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out drugs, and as therapy and assistance dogs. They're also natural athletes, and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=569437254854...    hope this helps.|`|PM23RDycaa	http://www.grca.org/allabout/index.html - Golden Retriever club.

QNdpLJmfaa	take all food out for five days remove the other female and make sure she is on substrate that will not mess  up her gut keep heat water and peace on her also make sure there is a comfortable moist place their is some medicine to help if she is impacted but give her more time.|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	"is it really nessecary to remove the other female cauz i really don't want to separate them"    Unless you want your gecko to die, yes.  This shouldn't even be a problem.  Your female is obviously stressed enough not to lay and it's not the male's fault, so obviously it's the female.  Because you "don't want to" separate them is just ridiculous.  Responsible breeders separate animals that are stressed... so be responsible here.  If your female stays eggbound too long, she WILL die... possibly even with vet care.    Also, responsible breeders would be prepared to separate any animal upon signs of stress.  My guess is that you don't have another enclosure ready... have you thought about where you're going to house the babies?  Also, is your laybox appropriate?  These are all things you should have thought about BEFORE you started breeding.  You don't need a pro to tell you this.    Separate her immediately and get her to a vet as soon as possible.

Im not all that possitive, **** Zus probably the best answer to me. Someone I know has two and I love them!|`|W0buucLsaa	Dachshunds, if BRED WELL, are fearless. If you are going to go the route of going to a *reputable* breeder (like through the Dachshund Club of America), that is the breed I would suggest.     But I've met little dogs who got along perfectly with big dogs, little dogs who couldn't stop playing with big dogs, little dogs who were aggressive towards big dogs, and little dogs who were scared to death of big dogs. For the most part, it's the dog's individual personality rather than the breed (or mix).     And that is why I would recommend going through a rescue organization and getting a young adult through them. They will know how the dog behaves with big dogs because they've been in foster families.     My sister-in-law got a 1-year old toy poodle this way, because she also has big dogs, and it worked out GREAT! She's got the best little dog ever. He is best friends with their 80 pound lab mix.
tDcItiATaa	Java moss is the only moss that i really know anything of, but it is excellent. Though for you, not wanting anything floating around, i would suggest to tie it down. For substrate i would suggest pretty much any good substrate that can be purchaced rom a pet store, though try not to make it corse, a nice fine/medium type but not sand unless it is what you want. Plants grow better with less corse substrate.  Sand is a good substrate, free moving for the plants, fish can borrow easily, though it can be high maitanence if not looked after properly, or too depending on the fish in the tank.  I myself have tried to keep things natural in my 50 Gal but, things are not that natural, hough my fish and els are extremely happy and playful. Here is a link if your interested in seeing?, i use a variety of plants, some java moss, though is hidden in caves, cichlid crush substrate, very corse stuff, i like its britness under the lights.    hope his helps.    http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=nnlhgx8ORy...  http://photobucket.com/TimFergusonsAquar...

Java moss is really your only option unless you spend alot of money to meet the requirements of glosso or something like that..    If you want natural i would go a sand and rock bottom with low light plants and driftwood. Very easy to control this.    I think you will really like the look of sand and its as natural as it get for alot of tropical fish.       good luck!!!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I used flourite as my substrate, but it needs to be rinsed very well before adding it to the tank.

qEp9fxU9aa	STOP, do not mess with your ph.  Don't put chemicals, including baking soda in your aquarium.  Start doing small 20% water changes right now and do this every day for 2-3 days then increase the amount to 30% for a few days then 50% every other day for 3 times then get on a schedule of 50% every other week or every week and you'll be fine.  Contact your local water department and find out what the ph and hardness of your water is and get fish that match these parameters.  If you go to your LOCAL PET STORE that specializes in fish and ask if the fish they have in their aquariums are in local water than you know you will be fine.  Unless you are trying to breed a specific fish and need particular water parameters don't mess with your water.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Do a 50% water change. Leave the ph alone. Chemicals will give you false readings. unless your ph is high, dont worry about it.
T8OFsBUUaa	Growling for a puppy can also mean play and excitement.     I can agree with the firm "no," but do not squeeze your dogs face. This is called positive punishment, and should never be used on a young puppy. Squeezing your dogs muzzle can teach your dog to be fearful of your hands, and he might find you unpredictable. Also, your message might be hard to interpret. Positive Punishment is difficult because the corrections need to be done as soon as the dog does the behavior. The few seconds it will take you to reach out and grab him will be long enough for the message to be lost anyway. A firm no can be delivered right away.     IN your situation, either ignore the sound entirely, and ask for a good behavior that he already knows, like sit. Or, say no, then ask for a good behavior. This teaches him growling doesn't get him anywhere, but a nice sit does.    If your dog does it in a friendly manner, as you describe, I would say continue to ignore it. When he realizes it yields him no rewards, he'll eventually drop it.|`|fpuPRNlWaa	At his present age, growling might mean getting attention and/or excitement. No need to stop it now it's normal and it'll eventually get minimal as he mature but it won't stop permanently it is part of a dog's natural behaviour. So no need to worry.|`|kP1AnhzUaa	my friend has that dog and yes it is its part of there growing up its a stage they will go through through the years so ya it is it will stop soon|`|GaL66jbQaa	I disagree that dogs should never growl.  There is a definite difference between a play growl and an aggressive growl only you know your dog.  but I would always make your dog do a command before you reward him.  Get him into a puppy class that has open play time so he can learn the rules of play and get socialized to a variety of different dogs and people. I think a lot of humane societies offer such classes.|`|mFNEbR3Maa	A dogs puppy stages are very weird to us humans such as your incident with your puppy how little kids become independent sorta like that but instead the puppy think you have no appreciated his work so every now and then when your puppy growls its probably when he accomplished something so your dog is not aggressive he is just feeling like he does not get enough credit when he does so if he starts to growl go good boy do not ignore him that may turn him aggressive but your puppy will grow out of the stage but motivate and reward him :) good luck hope this helps you ;) :D|`|WvbqAeSOaa	My shih tzus growl at each other all time and me sometimes. usually its for attention and non aggressive|`|okyA5YJsaa	Dogs should never growl and it's a pretty easy behavior to stop especially for a puppy.  Since it sounds like ignoring him doesn't work, whenever he growls give him a firm "No" and grasp his muzzle.  You don't need to hurt him or squeeze very hard but be very clear that you do not like whatever he did.|`|4914f4df6912d035b61dcc4b637afbf7aa	I'm not sure about the growling after going potty, but my shih tzu always tends to growl when he is playing with toys.  Maybe he is just doing it to get attention.  Cub tends to growl when playing until you play with him.  Good luck with your little guy.  I love the little guys myself.|`|8iYU2SMYaa	Your puppy is still very young.  However, not too young to get some simple training.  Do yourself and him a huge favor and take him to a puppy training class.  Locally they are offered at a reasonable price by Petsmart.    As far as the growling goes, it is probably normal until you train him differently.  My little dog does growl when we play, but when he wants attention, he has other behaviors.
1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Get her to the Vet and checked for a urinary tract infection.  If you are keeping a clean litter box then the first sign that something is wrong can be your cat going to the bathroom outside the litter box.  This seems more likely a UTI because up until now she's never done this.|`|791d4f9e4f79c13e41e826352dcb9b61aa	I agree with first answer|`|5ppj90aFaa	It is never a bad idea to drop off a urine sample at your vet's office. She might have a health problem- or it could be behavioral. Since you said you've had her since a young age- I don't think it's the latter. Just call up your vet clinic and tell them what's going on and if you should drop off a sample.|`|8uqbNrICaa	Have you in those 6 months taken her to the vet?

SytfXV6Haa	Unfortunately, some cats just aren't friends with other cats and should be monitored. However, you may need to put effort into reintroducing them. You should definitily keep them separated for now and slowly introduce them to each other. It may take some time, but sooner or later the cats will either get used to each other, or establish which of the two is the ruling cat of the home. While the two cats are safely separated you should have the them become aware of each other. You can do this by having the cats sniff each other under the door to a room. You can also do this by alternating having one cat in a cat carrier and having the the other one explore around the carrier. This will help both cats to get to know the others scents, sounds and visual appearance. You should also feed them in separate bowls, and if you can have separate litter boxes. As the cats come to recognize each other you can work on having their food bowls in the same room and if they eventually warm up to each other, side by side. I did this with my cats when I had to take my mom's cat in. They really disliked each other at first, but about 9 months later they're now eating side by side out of a dual dish.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Are either of them "fixed"???  If not, then that's the first thing that needs to be done.    Older females don't usually like to share their space with other females, but if the male that comes into the house has been neutered, or is a tiny kitten, they'll usually "adopt" or "adapt to" them fairly quickly.    You just need to let them work it out.  She will have to "set boundaries" for him.......and he WILL learn, given the chance.    If he hasn't been neutered, get that done ASAP, and he won't smell so "bad" to her.  If she hasn't been spayed, AND he hasn't been neutered, then they're acting like normal "couples", and when she's READY, they'll mate..........  :-)    Hope this helps.......Good luck.|`|iU8pIf35aa	I have faced a similar case when I bring a 2-month old exotic cat back while I have a 11 month old Himalayan cat.    For my case, the fight aren't serious as the Himalayan just want to show that he's the boss @ home.    If that is serious, maybe separate them in 2 rooms.     It takes times n that cause me many sleepness nite. The last thing I want to see is to give away any cat @ home.
rTSwouqXaa	Go with a 1/2 ton or better. It doesn't have to be a ford/chevy/dodge/toyota, but I do recommend a 1/2 ton or better with at least a V8. That way you have the power when you need it and your gas mileage will suffer less when hauling.|`|IhjFjoKDaa	You can pull a trailer with a ford ranger or an F150 but the honest truth is that the harder an engine has to work the more trouble you'll have on long hauls, big hills, and the sooner it will break down.    I wouldn't get anything smaller than an F250. We have a 1988 Ford diesel that is a little bigger than an F250 and it handles our steel stock trailer with no issues.    Bottom line - but something a little bigger and it will cost you less money in repairs and replacements in the long run.|`|meoRbjgCaa	I pull a 2 horse slant (steel) trailer with 2 horses with an f150 with a tow package.  I have the v-8 engine (be careful because some come with v-6).  It tows well, but is slower up steep grades. Make sure you get the tow package because it includes a transmission cooler and overdrive switch.|`|8bTder08aa	I own a Chevy 3/4 ton pickup, 1992 model, that now has 275,000 miles on it.  We have not babied it.  Oil changes per schedule, filters per schedule, everything else as needed.  It has been a great truck, very reliable.  (The interior is in bad shape now, but it runs well.)    To be honest, we didn't do much horse hauling with it, so I don't know if that would have affected it.    I don't know how much horse hauling you do, but it's worth asking the question:  could you get by with renting a truck for the tiimes when you need to haul horses?  Or paying someone else to haul them?  Gas prices have come 'way, 'way down from their height a few months back, but I sure wouldn't bet on the price staying low, and the downside of a big truck is BIG cost of gas run it.|`|fIbutEBxaa	If you are looking for something from the 90's then your best bet is a Dodge 250.  That would be the square type before the new body styles.  The 3/4 tons in the Dodges had the largest chassis underneath and were made to haul.   I have always seen Fords pulling a lot of horse trailers as well but I have had a lot of experience with working on them! Everyone is partial to their "brand" (we all know that!)  When buying an "older" vehicle a lot of it will depend on how the truck was treated and taken care of by its past owners.  If one comes with a lot of the upkeep receipts then it's probably gonna be a better choice than one that doesn't (not to say trucks without maintenance receipts are bad) but you can SEE that the truck was taken care of.  And yes, you'll need a V8 or a diesel (and think about gas prices too!).  Hope this helps!|`|sbB0TpGXaa	I had a 94 ford 3/4 ton that i liked because it had a 5.8 and got 16 and 17 mpg.    I now own a Dodge diesel (92) that gets right at 20 and gets 18 or better with my very heavy home made trailer with 3 horses.    However you could get by with a half ton.    Keep in mind that if you do a lot of towing avoid automatic transmissions in half tons.    I would also avoid automatic transmissions in 3/4 ton chevys and dodges.  Fords are a little better and their 3/4 tons can handle it well.    If I remember right the chevys of the early 90's got notoriously poor gas mileage.  Dodges of any year do unless you get their cummins diesel, but you will pay for that.|`|FWlSFpByaa	Go for a Ford F150, thats what i pull my horses in|`|XL62syrCaa	You want a horse that is a half ton or better. Look for trucks like a ford F250 (or higher) or a chevy 2500. You can usually find those types for under $5000. Also look for trucks (if they have highmiles) that have more freeway miles. Good luck on your search :)|`|Yvamytrzaa	Depending on how many horses you want to pull and how heavy your trailer is, i'd go with a Ford F250. I haul with a Ford F350 but I use mine for hauling dump trailers, too.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	You need at least a 3/4th ton, preferably a 1 ton truck. Other than that, any trunk brand will work well. It is usually easier (and cheaper for you) if you get one with electric brakes (I think they are also called trailer breaks) installed already. A 1/2 ton will work, but not as well as a 3/4 ton truck.    A very good investment is a 4x4.        We don't have 4x4 (we have a 1998 Ford F150 (I think, whatever their 3/4th ton is called)- extended cab) and it works, but we get stuck really really easily if the ground is even a little soft.       On hard ground, we pull a 3 horse trailer, and 3 horses with no problem, though it is a bit slow getting up to speed (most of our horses are draft or draft crosses, which may be why- the added weight).|`|qa4gjD52aa	i used a f150 to pull my trailer before i got my new truck it worked really well.

veDvtYhJaa	There's no sure way to know what killed the sheep.  He heard the commotion and didn't go check at the time it occurred.  His son didn't see your dogs till 6 hours later.  That proves NOTHING!    If this occurred during daylight, it's not too likely to be coyotes. But if you have wild dogs, they will do this.  As far as I know, they hunt at night.  BUT... you should check that out with your vet who can tell you more than I can.      The farmer is wrong to claim a coyote doesn't enter a fenced area.  That's totally false.  They also, if the pack is large enough, will go after the whole herd and separate out the weak and infirm to attack.    If Brownie had no blood on her, I don't think she could have done anything to the sheep.      I suggest you put a hot fence around your property.  That's what I use to keep the cattle and dogs controlled as to where they can or cannot go.  There are leash laws even in my rural area of east TN, and since your Husky tends to get out regularly, you're not doing the job you're required to by not keeping him contained.  Go to Tractor Supply and put in a hot fence and a 50mi charger that has a strong enough bite to stop a husky from leaving the yard.  There's coated wire to put underground where you have gates.    You also sound like you need to exercise your dogs more.  That may well be why Rocky wanders     Tell the farmer he needs to get a couple of LGD's (livestock guardian dogs)-!-|`|E5gaKzCsaa	There's no way, now, to prove that your dogs did or didn't kill the sheep, but if I were your neighbour I'd consider it an excellent possibility. Be glad he hasn't asked you to pay for the sheep and sounds like a reasonable man. If one sheep is missing, that sounds to me like something other than your dogs got to them, but again, there seems to be no way to prove anything. Just in case, if these were my dogs they'd never run loose again. Labs aren't known for having prey drive, but I have a Lab cross who certainly ran after deer a few times when she was young and silly. She just wasn't big enough to catch any. Huskies do have prey drive, in spades. They wouldn't go after the sheep for food but for entertainment, because that's how they are.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	That does not describe a lab at all..If you live in the country it may have been a coyote or wild dogs. I live in a rural area and some wild dogs took down a cow.     Labs have retriever instincts, not attack and kill|`|TxaUS7UUaa	if they're mean dogs then probably. if there nice friendly dogs then no.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I have had a number of huskys and they do have a high prey drive. I am sorry, but your dog probably did attack the sheep.  Coyotes may be around, but aren't likely to attack like that.  I had a husky that was fine with the house cats, but she would get loose and kill animals in the neighborhood with us chasing her. She killed chickens, skunks, pet rabbits and then our barn cat with us right on her heels.  Dogs will kill sheep or smaller animals that are not of your household.    I had a Lab when I was in middle school. It took me a long time to believe and come to terms that she had killed my best friend's ducks.  It took a long time.      I am sorry this happened. Your dogs don't know their territory by fence lines by canine reasoning.  The sad thing is the dogs were just being dogs.  Don't let Rocky wander, please. I had to take our husky back to the breeder and fortunately she had a place to go and got a new home.  It cost us over $500 and broke our hearts to have her go.  My daughters were 7 and 10 when that happened.|`|sOkePjK3aa	He is totally wrong on the coyote thing. I live in desert area and a coyote jumped a wall. [the walls are stone and about 5 1/2 feet tall. Rocky could have heard the sheep being attacked and gone over to see what was going on and you said Brownie follows Rocky so there you go. So he goes over there and there is either a stray or a coyote there. They see him and start a fight. He gets blood on his muzzle during the fight and Brownie stands on the sideline (probably nervous) and barks. So Rocky scares away the coyote and then the son comes out and sees them and he thinks it was them. I mean I can't blame him, if you were in his place, you'd think the same thing. I feel really bad for you. That's a though situation to be in. Good luck to you. Hope I've helped. :]|`|Kp5BOhNVaa	There's no way to say for sure. Coyotes are a possibility, it happens often, and your dogs could have heard the coyotes make a commotion with the sheep and ran over there and chased them off, or perhaps the coyotes might have left by then. Then Rocky might have smelled the blood and went to investigate.     It doesn't make sense why your dogs would attack the sheep that are grazing on your land everyday. But it doesn't make it an impossibility, so it can't be ruled out.     I would just follow the rules for now. Keep the dogs inside or make them a big fenced area to run in outside. If it was coyotes, maybe they will come back for another meal, if that's the case it could prove your dogs innocence.     Good luck, and sorry for your miss fortune.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Loose dogs are a recipe for disaster.     Dogs are actually more often a culprit simply because they have no fear of people and no inhibitions.  A coyote is killing to eat - a dog is chasing (and sometimes killing) because it is fun.  Coyotes usually avoid hours when people are around and they consume the sheep. Often what you'll see with dogs is the dead sheep and small pieces missing.     it's easy to kill a sheep without getting blood on the dog by running the sheep into a fence or post.  Also, i've found that as a raw feeder, my dogs can often clean themselves up very well and remove most traces of blood after eating.    You should not be allowing your dogs to roam (ever). You seem to be making a lot of excuses for your dogs but the truth is, when there is no human around, dogs often become pack animals that do things their owners would not suspect of them.  Most farmers shoot the dogs on sight and either confront the owner later or put the dogs in a hole and forget they ever saw them. They have NO obligation to prove the dogs were actually responsible.  So if your dogs are still alive you should be grateful.     Your neighbor should also invest in a guard animal (donkey, mule, dog) which will save him regardless if the problem animal was  a dog or coyote.
veDvtYhJaa	Dogs are loyal by nature.  It's not in the temperament of a dog to lie.  They just cannot do so.  If they like you, they honestly let you know.  If they don't like you; you really know it.      Loyalty is a part of always being truthful.  If you treat a dog well and fairly and you feed it and exercise the dog, then the dog will be loyal.  It's part of being honest and truthful. -!-|`|9UttDvcsaa	My dog Marco proves his loyalty by staying by my side at the dog park when all the other dogs are running and playing, he is trying to protect me!  I take him off of his leash and he still doesn't go to far.  He also watches Good Morning America with me every morning while I drink my coffee.  I can't remember a time when he missed that!  He is a big (70 lb) black and white collie and he is usually a cowardly lion type of dog.  My 4 year old daughter and I screamed our heads off at a spider the other day that was stuck to us in its web and he came running towards us with the most fierce presence barking and looking for the danger! LOL!  he is the BEST dog!|`|PfOBtpUdaa	Dogs are well known for their friendliness and affection toward their owners. However, dogs are more than just a friendly animal presence in the home that barks when it wants attention. Dogs can provide companionship, as well as known health benefits to their owners.    Studies have proven that dog owners have lower blood pressure than people who do not own a pet, but rely solely on medication to control high blood pressure. This is because animals relieve stress and tension, which are contributing factors in increased blood pressure. Having a dog to make a fuss of is also a diversion from health complaints.  Dog owners have an extra reason to exercise and that is because they have a dog to walk each day. Having a dog means that pet owners must now consider the health needs of their pet, rather than continue to procrastinate when it comes to exercise. Walking provides owners with a good cardiovascular workout. Dogs that walk at a faster pace make their owners walk faster to keep up with them. The result is that the pet owners end up burning more calories than they would if they took a leisurely walk  Dogs can grow into very loyal and loving pets for their owners. Their presence helps to alleviate feelings of loneliness, boredom and isolation, particularly for single pet owners. A dog that allows its owner to stroke it will often reciprocate, by affectionately nuzzling up to its owner. Dogs also provide good companionship and they often react with great loyalty if they see their owners under threat. Whereas people are known to judge, criticize or belittle, dogs show loyalty to the owner who feeds and cares for their welfare. It is an endearing quality of animals that is quite common  Dogs have a keen sense of danger. Various news reports have made mention of the bravery of dogs as they alerted their owners to danger, such as a burning house, which in effect, saved their lives. Dogs will often also attack a trespasser who threatens their owner verbally or physically.    Pet owners often enjoy an improved quality of life, as they strive to take care of the needs of their canine friends. Focusing attention on the dog can make some people forget about their loneliness and health problems. In return, they have a loyal companion for life.  Like I said they ARE mans best friend.            I HOPE THIS HELPS!! :) have fun!|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	In the wild in order for them to survive they have to be part of a pack every one of them has a job n its mostly to please the alfa if they do not belong to a pack they do not survive so its all about survival|`|fP0C9s8daa	When dogs are loyal, they will stick with you no matter what .

pDKm9Wmgaa	She is stressed. She knows you are sick, she heard you crying, and she hasn't been out for exercise. This is not meant to make you feel guilty. It is an explanation. If you are bedridden right now, your husband, roommate, or a friend should be enlisted to take the dog out for a long run. She needs to be kept in an enclosed area like a dog park so she doesn't run away from the dogwalker. She needs to be exercised until she is plumb tuckered out. Then when she comes home, give her as much attention as you can.   I hope you and she are both feeling better soon. :)|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Sounds like she just needs to go for a long walk...let out the stress and energy.

He is amazing with my 2 yr old and he even taught her to share toys. As for destructive, He loves to chase animals and he loves to dig (watch out if you have a fenced in yard.) We have him in his crate during the daytime when we are at work and he happily sleeps in it. We close it when we are out otherwise it is open all the time. At night time occasionally he will sleep there with it open. We tried to take away the crate one time and he cried for a few hours so we gave it back to him. I would look into it.

There's is no such thing as an odorless dog, either, unless you plan to keep it in a plastic bubble.    Proper training will prevent most dogs from being destructive.    If you want a calm dog, then I would not recommend you get a puppy and suggest you adopt an older dog. Check out your local shelter or pound, and take a look at Petfinder. Shelter dogs are usually up to date with their shots, and are already spayed/neutered (so if you were planning on having an intact dog, adoption isn't really a great option). Some of them are already housebroken or know basic commands.|`|d6HXwlpPaa	Everyone of the qualities on your wish list can be attributed to the boykin spaniel!

Not high pitched|`|ojxOpAQmaa	Have you tried a bark control collar    The effectiveness of any bark control device depends on a number of factors such as the dog's temperament, breed, size, age and the motivation for barking. Sonic and ultrasonic anti barking devices can be effective for puppies or small barking dogs with placid/timid personalities but larger barking dogs or barking dogs with a determined temperament may ignore the audible or ultrasonic deterrent noises that these anti bark products emit and continue on barking.    Citronella collars are a good option in comparison to the sonic & ultrasonic anti bark devices. The citronella spray acts as a much more effective barking deterrent compared to sound as it involves more of the dog's senses and thus has a higher chance of getting the dog's attention. We have also found that many barking dogs do not like the smell of citronella and learn quickly to stop barking in order to avoid the unpleasant spray. Citronella bark collars are also a good option for people who live in states where static correction anti bark collars or the use of them are restricted.    Static correction anti bark collars (e-collars) are the most effective bark control product available. How the bark collar is introduced, age, breed, temperament and motivation for barking will all play a part in the end result. Generally speaking, these types of anti bark collars will be 98% successful so this represents a significant barking decrease. The benefits of these anti bark collars versus stand-alone traditional dog training methods include greater consistency, speed & timing of correction (no time delay), cost effectiveness and little time is required from the owner.|`|4oO130L1aa	Just as human language is multifaceted and multipurpose, barking allows a dog to communicate many different messages in a variety of situations. It can signal a request to an owner ("Hey, I want to go outside!"), impart a warning ("You're in my territory!"), or simply serve to amuse when a dog has little else to do.  An instinctive canine behavior, a bark now and then reminds you that your dog is still very much a dog. However, constant barking can be disruptive, if not downright nerve-racking. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent or curb problem barking.    Here's how to treat this problem http://tinyurl.com/5agl4q
IuYekkPVaa	He's training you to come when called :o)      Seriously though, cats mainly communicate with each other through smell and body language, but they quickly realise that we don't understand those signals and that we use sound to communicate instead.  So they meow when they want your attention or just to greet you.  Some cats are naturally more talkative than others, and develop quite a wide vocabulary of different meows and sounds to request specific things such as feed me or open the door.    The Messybeast web site has a really good article on cat vocal communication which you might find interesting.    http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk.htm|`|9G03aQhsaa	Watch what your cat does as it meows.  They are just trying to get your attention.  They are usually saying "lets play" "I'm hungry" or "change my litter" .  Mine usually walk to their bowl as they meow to ask for food, same with their box.  Really they just want some attention.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	You have to learn your cat. My cats- they will meow and stay by the food dish if they're hungry, meow by the door if they want to go in the backyard ( screened in). Also, it might seem silly, but sometimes I could tell what they want by the way they meow. They'll meow loudly if they want attention or want to get away. They'll meow not too loud and rub ub against the food dish if they want food.

Also if you cat needed to go into a cattery then this would not be recognised, likewise with pet insurers.  Get yourself to the vets and get some actual vaccinations.

Estos individuos estn buscando un distanciamiento social y una potenciacin de su imagen superior, de poder, mediante la tenencia de ciertos animales de compa?a.    Pero tambin actan como una barrera social aquellos animales que son buscados como una excusa, como una importantsima e ineludible obligacin. Algunas personas, generalmente de cierta edad, se rodean de mascotas para pertrecharse con una monta?a de obligaciones; una forma de justificar su ms profundo deseo de no relacionarse.    Por ltimo, podemos encontrarnos con ciertos propietarios de animales exticos, entre otros serpientes o arcnidos. Algunos de ellos buscan un distanciamiento mediante unos animales que no suelen ser del agrado de la mayora; con su compa?a consiguen que muy pocos de los de su entorno familiar o social estn interesados en visitarlos, y mucho menos en traspasar los lmites de la habitacin en la que residen esos "bichos".    Y volviendo a las vas de interaccin social, y tras dejar atrs la atencin, entremos de lleno en la conversacin.    Si simplificramos al mximo este punto, podramos decir algo tan bsico como que aquel que tiene una mascota, tiene un tema ms de conversacin.    Pero intentemos profundizar un poco; vamos a valorar los siguientes ejemplos: los hombres que han hecho el servicio militar pueden pasar horas hablando de las interminables guardias que padecieron, de las virtudes o maldades de sus superiores y compa?eros...?cientos de sus superiores y compa?eros.    ?Y qu podemos decir del ftbol? Los amantes del "deporte rey", pueden eternizarse entre alabanzas a sus jugadores favoritos, en una defensa encarnizada de sus colores o estimulando su ms fina irona para minar la moral de los seguidores de los equipos contrarios.    ?Bueno! ?Y los asiduos lectores de revistas "del hgado"?, ?y los fieles televidentes de programas del corazn? Este gran grupo social conoce "al dedillo" los amores y desamores, el nmero de hijos y de amantes, los colores de la tapicera de los sillones del saln, los accesorios de los doscientos cuartos de ba?o y hasta la marca de los zapatos de todos los personajes del "cuore". ?Cuntas horas de conversacin se invierten en estos temas? Mirmoslo por el lado positivo: al menos es una va de dilogo, algo de los que desgraciadamente no vamos sobrados.    En definitiva, tanto "los de la mili", como "los del ftbol", como "los del corazn" y, por supuesto, "los de las mascotas", encuentran en esos temas un gratificante medio de conversacin, una forma especial de relacionarse con sus semejantes.    Nuestras mascotas, no lo dudemos ni un momento, consiguen romper hasta la ms gruesa y dura capa de hielo, que aporta, o que inconscientemente buscamos en la tenencia de una u otra mascota; hemos comentado los beneficios sociales que obtenemos a travs de la atencin y de la conversacin que sugiere un animal de compa?a. Pero no podemos olvidar el punto fundamental, aquel en el que coinciden la gran mayora de las personas que tienen o desean tener un animal de compa?a; precisamente eso: la compa?a.
1ea0b6bebaeb9d80d8669c797b8a4291aa	Las piedritas no se cambian todos los dias, se sacan con una palita las piedritas que estan mojadas revisando bien todos los rincones de la bandeja y las cacas visibles, luego se reponen las piedras que se sacaron. Pero una vez por semana o cada 15 dias se cambian las piedritas totalmente. En ese momento ademas de lavar con detergente y agua la bandeja hazle un enjuague con cloro y dejale algo del mismo en el fondo de la bandeja. sobre eso le hechas las piedritas. Algunos le agregan al agua de limpieza una cucharada de bicarbonato, no lo he probado personalmente pero es inocuo y vale la pena probar.

AA11216118	If he is young and isn't neutered, he could be "marking" his territory. The best way to keep male dogs from marking EVERYTHING is to neuter them when they are as young as is safe.     Otherwise, the best thing to do is buy a crate, and confine the dog to it for a few hours (they come with instructions, you need to make him feel like the crate is "home" and not a punishment). When you let him out, take him outside immediately. He'll probably "go" then, and you can praise him.    Don't punish him after the fact if he keeps doing his business in the house, dogs can't understand delayed punishments or praise, and he'll just become fearful of you.|`|Lsfh6Yxzaa	to use the bathroom in the house ?  close the bathroom's door..    they censor some really naive words in here, like p.o.o , how do you want us to explain effectively when everyone is afraid of words  . it's incredible.    so anyway  take his p.o.o outside while the dog will be following you.   get a bottle of spray ready and spray his face when he does it inside.|`|TepAZAHyaa	has anything changed in his environment lately?

Mok0zXtDaa	Normaly Stables are on Ranches , in the country . Stables being barns or long houses for animals. Show Cows, Llamas, some goats, and some pigs live in Stables/barns . There are barns for Chickens and Turkeys , and other birds we eat that need protecting.   A Horse stable sometimes has a goat living with a lonley horse, Horses being herd animals can get depressed living alone and can develop bad habbits like chewing wood, or sucking on it and passing out, or walking back and forth quickly causing damage to there legs.  Stables are a nice place for animals to live in the cold weather or when they have a turn out where they can go out onto grassy pasture during the day time, and go to bed in the stable at night.   
ArBOK95aaa	a) cats are not dogs.  You would be surprised how many people confuse this.  b) cats are not independant creatures.  They have earned that rep because they adapt to being left alone.  I have six cats are not only are they extremely social and affectionate with one another, they are extremely social and affectionate to me  c) cats are dependant on you all of their lifes, which hopefully is 15-20 years.  Make sure you have provisions (aka financial resources) to care for a cat.  so many posts here are I have a cat and I can't afford x what do I do.  d) indoor cats live longer healthier lives than outdoor cats.  e) indoor cats (and outdoor cats) need regular check ups and trips to the vet - because cats are very good at hiding illnesses.  f) indoor cats who use a litter box, who suddently stop using the box means there is something wrong in the cat's life.  Most of the time it is medical, bring it to a vet  g) all cats shed.  Surprisingly short haired cats shed more than long haired cats.  Long haired cats groom their hair and injest it more and end up with more hairballs.  Combing them can reduce/eliminate this.  h) cats need to play with you.  schedual half an hour to an hour for play a day  i) kittens are a LOT of work.  They are basically human toddlers at a birthday party hyped up on sugar.  They have two modes, on and off.  manners are still tenuous, and almost everyone who has a kitten ends up with bites and scratches.  Kittens should be adopted in pairs for their sanity and yours.  j) if you want something specific in a cat (a type of behavior) talk to a rescue or a shelter.  Get an older cat that the staff know.  You'll get exactly what you are looking for.  k) all cats should be altered.  If you are getting a kitten make sure it is altered, or schedual an exam immediately to set up an appointment for it.  Its better for the pet, better for the homeless pets out there, and better for you  l) feed your new cat a species appropriate diet.  you'll ward off a great deal of medical issues if you start them on a good diet from the start.  Check out http://www.catinfo.org.  a website run by a vet who studies feline nutrition.  As much as I love and rely on vets, they don't do a lot of time studing feline nutrition, and often rely on pet food companies to tell them what is right.  Kinda like you listening to McDonald's about what is good for you to eat.  m) what ever you want your cat to do, or not to do, start immediately.  don't want it on the kitchen table, never allow it.  the cat will keep trying to get away with stuff.  be persistant.  n) cats need to climb and scratch.  Get a scratching post *at least* as tall as your hip.  o) never scold your cat.  they don't understand negatives.  Always praise behavior you do want.  ignore behavior you don't. A firm "NO" while they are doing behavior you don't want should stop them.    I'm writing a book here :) there are lots of great books out there.  I highly recommend the one by dr. elizabeth hodgkins|`|AA10633259	They shed, and cough up nasty looking hairballs. |`|9E189oVqaa	They need to be trained to use a scratch pole or a designated area to scratch. most people complain that their cat destroys their furniture.

vGP1ZXUuaa	First of all, NO reputable breeder breeds MUTTS, which is what all these so-called "designer breeds" are.  They are mixed breeds; someone got the idea by calling them Morkies or Puggles or whatever they sound rare and desirable and therefore gullible and uninformed people will line up to have their money taken away from them.    Unfortunately, except for truth in advertising, there's not much you can do about it, except to become educated and to spread the word.  If your state has a puppy lemon law there may be some recourse, but don't hold your breath.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Contact your attorney and see if you can sue to get back your $700 plus $3000.  There should be some kind of a guarantee on your pup on health issues.   Write a registered letter to the breeder or who ever you bought your pup from informing them you are seeking legal action against them.  Then have your attorney send them a letter.  I am sure they will respond quickly.  Also make sure you have everything documented because you will need this in court.  If you can, call the Humane Society to report them. |`|eu6UQElYaa	No unfortunately it's not actually against the law to advertise that way, because by the advertiser's standards she may be a reputable breeder (even though by most any pet owner's standards she is clearly not a reputable breeder).     It's not really against the law for her to breed dogs nor is it against the law for her to breed mixed breed or even unhealthy dogs.  It is against the law for her to say something like "the puppy is vet checked and free from health problems" and then come to find out that the puppy had health problems from birth.  That would be grounds for a lawsuit.   Other than that, if she is like most puppy mills, the dogs are probably kept in deplorable conditions, denied veterinary care, neglected and abused.   That would include keeping the dogs in small cages constantly, only letting them out to breed, having dogs that are severely malnurished, having dogs that have open wounds/sores, matted nasty hair, dirty water, dirty living conditions, etc.   The only other restrictions could be zoning restrictions, you are only allowed to breed in certain areas, if she's not in one of those areas then she can be shut down and fined.     Call the ASPCA or Humane Society or animal control in your area, whoever deals with complaints of animal misconduct or cruelty and report that you suspect her of running a puppy mill.  They will investigate and if they determine that the dogs are being abused then they will go from there.   |`|cETQuE9waa	 A "Morkie" is just a fancy name for a mutt. No offense to you but, you paid a lot of money for a mutt probably from a puppy mill.   There are even puppy mills that breed purebred dogs. There are also a lot of shady purebred back yard breeders as well.     You just have to be really careful where you get your dog from and research, research, research.  A reputable breeder does genetic tests such as OFA, Penn Hip, MSU, CERF, BAER...ect.  They test for every genetic disease in their breed and if they find their dog is infected with ONE disease they do not breed it because they do not want to pass these traits onto the puppies. They spay or neuter the dog that has the disease/condition.  They also breed their dogs to the standard and breed to better the breed.     I am so sorry to hear of all you and your little dog is going through.     Many pet stores say their dogs are from reputable breeders when really they come from commercial breeders or puppy mills where they are breed to death and not genetic tested. |`|KxjUim7yaa	 If you did a DNA test you should know what breeds the parents were. If they were not what you were told when you bought the puppy there may be a law suit potential here. I would ask to see the parents before I bought any puppy. This is the risk taken when buying these mixed breed dogs- misrepresentation.|`|Bw18seFqaa	The problem is, there is no law that defines what a "reputable" breeder is..  for many.. "reputable" just means someone who provides minimal care for their dogs.  To some people, "reputable" means the dogs have some kind of registration!  Many puppy mills are USDA licenced, which defines "reputable" to some people.  In some states there are puppy lemon laws, but even those are pretty much limited.. and in many states those laws do not apply.. if the dog was purchased from a miller and sold by a 3rd party, you may be out of luck!    Your first hint that it was not a reputable breeder should have been the fact that they were selling mixed breed dogs.  This is why its important to do your research and find out for yourself what to look for in a breeder to avoid making the mistake of buying a dog that may have health issues.      Your best defence is to educate people.. for example, when someone justifies bying a mix from a breeder because "hybrids are healthier than purebreds.." you can point out that you paid quite a bit to obtain a mix, and it turned out to have an expensive genetic health issue.  For the same price- maybe a lil more, you could have gotton a pet-quality purebred dog from a reputable breeder that does genetic health testing (I paid $800 for my crested from a top breeder!).. or you could have gotton the same cute little mix in a shelter for much cheaper.|`|lhbpBnBAaa	You should of known RIGHT off the bat it was a lie if they said they were a reputable breeder, but were selling a "Morkie".|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	You could have had your answer before you even bought this puppy.  No reputable breeder breeds mixed breed dogs.  Period.    In looking to buy a Morkie--that immediately rules out reputable breeders.  A morkie is not a breed, it is a mutt.   That only leaves BYB and puppy mills to supply this type of dog.  Whether a westie is in the mix or not is irrelevant.    We stop this by education.|`|AA11980483	Probably not against the law but certainly within  the reach of a civil lawsuit.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	So you took their word for it that they were reputable without checking further?  And, you bought a mutt? Shame on you!! Buyer beware!!|`|AA12126470	No reputable breeder on the planet would sell Morkies.  They are a mixed breed dog not  produced by any reputable breeders.  Only produced by people who are breeding dogs for money.|`|RbEVYv0kaa	yea its false advertising unless they can prove it on paper. i'd report them. |`|AA11525891	Bad news friend, DNA can not identify dog breeds. If you have access to the alleged sire and dam a DNA test can tell you if they are the real parents but not the breed. In some states you have a case for false advertising but another issue is what defines a "puppy mill". In most states that term doesn't legally exist.|`|c5eeba4eae0b989e5215d3cd6ec48329aa	Your first clue is that a reputable breeder would never breed a mutt and give it a fancy name like Morkie.  Notify the humane society - there are laws now regarding puppy mills that give the humane society some better leverage in closing these places down, but they need proof from buyers.  Good for you for taking care of the poor thing. Best of luck.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	It sounds to me like you could have prevented the entire thing. No reputable breed would EVER breed for a mutt or "designer breed." Reputable breeders only breed pure bred dogs that exhibit breed type, have good temperament and are healthy. Second it was up to you go to the breeder and evaluate if it's a reputable breeder or not. A puppy mill is pretty easy to find. They breed more than 2 breeds of dogs, they have many litters at a time, they sell "designer" dogs, and that they advertise as a reputable breeder. A real reputable breeder would never advertise, they have owners find them, then they screen the owners to see if they're good enough to own their dog.|`|0xUB3JyDaa	That's terrible. I'm so sorry about this situation, but it's great that you're trying to fix the problem and that you're still taking care of your puppy even if she isn't what you wanted originally.    This is a good reason why it's best to meet the parents of a puppy before agreeing to purchase it. It shows that the breeder is trustworthy and allows you to get more information beforehand.    I'd like to help you report these people, but I have no idea where you live. I suggest speaking with your local rescue group or the humane society for information on who you can report this to.    If they aren't private sellers, then I suggest filing a BBB complaint as well.    Good luck! I hope you get these jerks shut down!|`|V2JIKJ0Naa	How do you stop it?    Don't buy high-priced mutts.  If you want a purebred dog, do your homework. Contact the breeder. Visit their facility, if you can. Remember that you get what you pay for.     As long as people are willing to "cheap out" for a puppy or are willing to believe a high-priced dog must be quality or are not willing to put any effort into finding out about their potential pet and breeder, there will be unscrupulous puppy-millers out there to rip them off.|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	Sounds like you bought her from someone that sells other people's dogs (a broker). NO REPUTABLE breeder would be producing MORKIES.  You might be able to report the person or company you actually bought the pup from, but it will probably come down to "well the breeder told me that's what it was".    Without a written guarantee for congenital and hereditary health problems, sorry, not much you can do but learn from your mistake.    Check to see what the lemon laws for your state are.    The best steps to take  1. do not support puppymills  2. educate yourself better on choosing a breeder  3. help educate others|`|3uIOlUo7aa	It is no more illegal for them to be ignorant and irresponsible than it is for you to in your purchase.   'reputable'  means having reputation - reputation can be good OR bad ... so everyone could be considered 'reputable' -- not RESPONSIBLE nor knowledgeable and ethical....     You didn't do your homework - you weren't responsible in your procurement as you don't know what being a good, responsible breeder is -- it isn't someone that will sell their puppies online by a third party ... so ANYONE that sells their puppies via a broker site is simply an irresponsible back yard greeder or puppy miller... that isn't too difficult to find out or understand but it seems a LOT of people can't find it out before they irresponsibly support one of these sorts....     BTW, no responsible, knowledgeable breeder would make mutts --- gosh you did like NO learning before buying your dog so you supported them and got what you actually deserve - an ignorantly and irresponsibly bred dog..     How do we stop it -- by letting people know that they are being irresponsible in their support of byber/pms.   You need to take responsibilities for your OWN irresponsibility and ignorance..  I know, you will get all miffed about that but, doesn't matter... doesn't change the truth..|`|E5vq4rNQaa	  Did you get a health certificate when you purchased the puppy and if so read it carefully and find out how long the health guarantee is for.     If you see that the guarantee was still good around the time you took the puppy to the vet than you can press charges against them and make them pay you for the vet bills and if you choose to take it further you can call the animal welfare office in your area and turn them in for inappropriate breeding of degenerate dogs.Their shop will be put out of business and they could go to jail.|`|HiLdXSb6aa	well first off its a morkie that should have to alarm bells ringing. did you see any parents? did you ask about them? the amount of "designer dogs" out there is sickening. a lot of people, myself included, have spent many years trying to improve dog breeds and then we have these people going out looking for their morkies and their labradoodles and all they do is ruin the breed. this is a list of "designer dogs" http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/hybriddogs.h... all your gonna do is risk getting all the bad things many people have been trying to get rid of, as many people unfortunately find out too late. you can be sure these puppy mills dont have their dogs tested before breeding them all they want is as many pups as they can get to make a bit of money. they have no love for the breeds at all its horrible
AA11525891	I have dealt with this problem with very large dogs (We raise and rescue Great Pyrenees) as well as my wife's Whippet.     One of our unadoptable's is very body sensitive and hates to be touched in any way, weighs over 100 lbs  and Grooming him is a production.    Please don't put him down for this, it is workable but the biting is a big problem.     Several options.  The muzzle (hard or soft) or a pair of nylons fashioned into a muzzle is an option. This how ever will cause great stress and may cause him to react to even having the muzzle put on.     Another is to have a vet prescribe Acepromazine (a mild water soluble sedative). Please do not depend on "Rescue Remedy" or "Canine Calm and Cool"for this. They are great products but will not work here. Give him the "Ace" in hamburger or a hot dog.    One you have the dog muzzled or mildly sedated (just enough to take the "edge" off) and if he is small enough, have someone sit in a chair with a sheet or large beach towel on their lap. Put the dog feet outwards on the persons lap and wrap him in the sheet/towel except for one foot. Have the person in the chair hold the dog with both hands.    Use a dremel grinding tool or one of those new pet nail trimmers especially if the nails are over grown.    The "Ace" wears off in a few hours with no side effects.      Third option is to take him to a vet and have them do the nails.|`|NW8XDbr0aa	definitly dont do what the person a few above me said about pinning the dog down before u trim his nails. that is a technique that ceaser millian does on the dog whisper. that technique is danergous b/c an aggressive dog being forced in a submission postion will most likely fight back and could cause some injures. this should only be done by a profession who knows what they are doing.    please dont take the dog back. not many people will take an abuse dog in  and u cannot just give up on it. it will take time  i think that u should just go ahead an muzzel the dog to trim its nails. have an adult hold the muzzeled dog and another trim. if u havent done so already teach the dog to lie down and stay.  u have to make this experinece a goood one.dont make it tramatic forr him. have a favorite treat of his and use this to help u. before u mussel him u have to let him know that his clippers and muzzle his good. call him and show him the clipper and say Clipper and give him a treat do this a few time and thne walk away and say CLIPPER and c if he comes. if he does then that mean he know that whne u say CLIPPER it mean treat. when u r ready to trim nails say CLIPPER and when he comes give him a treat. he also has to come to the muzzel. show him a treat and give it to him while putting the muzzle on. then take it off after 3o sec and then do it again. do this about 4 times and do it longer each time he needs to know that the muzzel will be taken off and not kept on him forever.. then on the last time have the muzzle on and tell him to lay down and stay.then u can have u and another adult massage him while the muzzle is on.i know that u siad that he is sensitve in some areas so try to massage him in areas u know that he is confortable with like maybe behind the ear or leg. then do that for about 5mins and while the one person is massaging the other can clip the nails. if he gets spooked then take a break and take of the muzzel. the do it again in 10 mins or so. it takes time and pactients.  if is sensitve about his feet maybe u could distract him  while u touch his feet, just enough so he wont freak out. maybe u could have him lick peanut butter in one of ur hands while the other just touches his paws and then u could try lifting a lttle his paw. u could give this a try before u actually try trimming the nails.    to reduce the amount of times u have to trim the nails take ur dog on walks where  there is concrete like on sidewalks or take him on  the street. when walking on these type surfaces it will trim the nails for u.  |`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I would really like to try and understand why you would adopt a severely abused dog knowing that a dog like that is obviously going to have serious trust issues, and then turn around and threaten to toss this dog back into a shelter in 36 hours if he doesn't magically decide to trust you?  My heart goes out to your daughter.    People who take on abused dogs should have enough dog savvy and certainly enough compassion to understand that it's going to take much longer than a lousy 2 months for the kind of trust it would take trimming nails on a dog with nails as long as his.    He needs time - a lot more time - and he may never allow anyone to clip his nails.  You don't know what's happened to this dog in the past.  Perhaps once he trusts someone, and that means with a lot of work allowing his feet to be handled first, you could use a dremel.|`|ZmFa6FL2aa	you will learn a lot about how to help a dog feel better about stuff at this site www.fearfuldogs.com there's even a link somewhere on it to a video on youtube called tucker's nail trim that shows how you work with a dog's feet. stop trying for now until you understand the process of changing how dogs feel. instead find a hard surface, and take him for lots of walks or let him chase balls. i work at a shelter and we take dogs to a tennis court, cause it's fenced and let them chase balls. sometimes we let them play too long and their nails get worn down too much!|`|Ei85kgfdaa	muzzle or something REEEALLY yummy. like peanut butter smeared all over a bowl.

He was used as a bait dog in dog fights, had a bullet wound in his side, was severly underweight, and terrified of men and children.    He is now a perfect weight (well, could lose a few pounds from treats, there's a ban on them currently), a very fun loving and friendly dog, loves people who come over and everybody wants to take him home with them, extremely smart, and is also terrified of getting his nails trimmed.    We don't do them ourselves because he's got dark nails and we don't want to cut them too short. We take him to a groomers down the street and one person literally has to hold him down while the groomer cuts them. Thankfully she understands and is okay with doing it but it's hard and she has been nipped at. Our vet tried to do it once and that did not work out at all.    If I were you I would get a muzzle, one that you know for sure he wouldn't be able to bite you, put him in a bathroom, or other small room, and at least file the nails down. Please do not return him to the shelter. If you do he will most likely be put down and you are the one who chose to adopt a dog, do the right thing! You can also keep the nails worn down by walking him on sidewalks.    Our dog would definitely have been put down if he was in a shelter. He just needed some TLC and some time to become one of the best dog there is. You should at least wear the nails down until you can put him under to cut them. You may also want to try that new nail file that's been advertised. Just get him a muzzle so you don't get hurt. And be sure to praise him with a lot of positive attention, no negative attention!    You can also start getting him used to human touches by sitting on the floor in a calm, quiet area, and letting him come up to you. Each time he comes to you, give him a small treat and say good boy, in a calm but happy voice. Then begin to pet him, back and head (or wherever he feels most comfortable being touched) and say good boy again and give him a treat, continue this, praising him as you pet him. If he looks uncomfortable or begins to growl, take it back a step. As he gains trust with you, begin touching his paws, stomach, and neck. The neck especially is a vunerable part of a dog. Do this only when he really trusts you.    Please do not take him back to the shelter. When you chose to adopt him you chose to take care of him. I've been through this with our dog before, it's not easy, but I would never think of giving him away.|`|p7swtBYzaa	2 professionals have tried and couldn't trim the dog's nails and they are so long they twist sidewasy????  Are you for real?    A professional - or even an owner with some sense - can muzzle a dog, have someone help hold him - and cut those nails.   It is downright dangerous to let his nails grow that long - you have got to do something.    Sounds to me as if your "professionals" were not very professional and you didn't make much of an effort.     Any vet or vet tech could do this also - they are used to dealing with frightened animals.  I've dealt with many abused, scared dogs, and had their nails trimmed by a vet, vet tech, or groomer - these people know how to deal with it - obviously you want to return this dog and don't want to spend any money on him for grooming or vetting.    Get some help, to return a dog to a shelter because you can't get his nails trimmed is downright ridiculous.     Stop trying to force the issue yourself and get a professional to do it -  they use soft cloth muzzles so they don't get bitten if they need to restrain the dog.    Any vet who tells you Benadryl will relax a dog enough to handle when he is terrified is not a vet I would use.   Benadryl is for allergies, it can make a dog a little sleepy, but it is no tranquilizer.   There are good tranquilizers for dogs, but again, you need to pay a vet.    Your putting the poor pooch on a 36 "hours only" "last chance" pretty much shows that you want to get rid of the dog - no wonder your daughter is in tears - pretty heartless of you to make a mountain out of a molehill like this.  Get professional help with the dog's grooming - that simple and doesn't cost all that much either.    I've worked with many abused, terrified, dogs and 2 months is hardly enough to help them overcome their issues and learn to trust again, it takes time and patience --- putting a 36 hour limit on this poor pooch after having him for 2 months is horrible, why did you get the dog if you won't make a real committment to him.  You are being truly heartless, this dog has been through enough without being rejected again just because you can't trim his nails.|`|2AQhpiLuaa	my dog gets aggressive whenever someone touches its paws so when my sister takes him to get groomed they usually muzzle him...

My vet told me her nails will always be longer than average - when they haven't been trimmed for that long, it is what happens.      If he is biting, you are probably cutting into the quick, so no amount of Benadryl will help.     If you are not cutting into the quick, muzzle him.  Get him relaxed with treats.  Try loosely wrapping him in a nice warm fleece blanket and give more treats.  Show the clippers and let him sniff.  More treats.  Move clippers to nail and touch, but don't clip.  More treats.  Have another adult hold him while you clip.  One nail at a time, and followed by treats.  Lots of positive praise, but no "comforting" tone of voice - this tends to make the anxiety worse as it confirms to the dog that something *is*, indeed, wrong.    Also, try something else besides Benadryl.  Ask for a dog-specific anti-anxiety medication.      I haven't tried it, but have you used the new pawticure or whatever its called?    Good luck!|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	First of all this dog needs to really know you are not there to hurt him but he also needs to know that you are the alpha dog.  We've been through this but not to where the nails have been so bad.  Your wife or someone else needs to help you with the nail trimming.  First of all you need to pin the dog until it relaxes and turns it's head away from you.  It knows you are the boss, the alpha dog.  You may need to muzzle him for your own protection at first.  The length of the dogs nails are horrible from your description but the best way is with a dremel.  You may to clip some of the nail first and then use the dremel to file down more (better way than clipping) find where the quick is.  I'm sure you already know this but if the nail is clear you can see the pink of the quick, if the nail is dark you can see a different color on the underside that tells you where the quick is.  Check the paws of your other dogs if they have dark nails to know what I mean.  With the dark nails (a groomer told me this) you file them to the same length as the darkest one.  Two nails long 1 dark, 1 white, trim the dark closest to the white nail.  It'll take a while for him to get used to this but he will eventually.  It will take you and someone else helping.  If you don't want to invest in a muzzle then you need someone who can hold his mouth and head and do a constant good boy and maybe give him a treat while this is going on.    For his fears they may never leave him but try laying down with him (no other dogs around) and giving him reassurance.    Good luck and I hope this has helped.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I know, I'm breaking your rules by responding. . I've never owned an abused animal (as keen as I am to adopt when I move out!). I'm really only speaking from other experiences, my opinions and a lot of reading.    Trust can take a long time to build. You say he "still" has trust issues like two months is a great while, but really, it isn't at all. That's only eight weeks. Sixty days. Think of how many years a person who was abused as a child spends in therapy working on their trust issues!  Before you can tackle anything like nail-trimming, you need to work on your relationship. Since he doesn't trust you anyway, every time you "betray" him by trying to touch his nails, he becomes a little less trusting. You're sliding back down the hill.   Here are a few sites that offer tips:  http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/p...  http://ezinearticles.com/?Tips-To-Gain-T...  http://dog-care.suite101.com/article.cfm...    Even normal dogs with no history of abuse can be very touchy if they were never taught to embrace human contact. That's why, when you have a new puppy, you need to condition it to accept your touch by handling it all over, everywhere, every day, all the time, and praising, petting and feeding treats to accepting it.    So, you'd have to start REALLY slowly. I mean, it might take anywhere from a week to a month or more to get past a single step.   I imagine the first step would be just to be in the general vicinity of his paws without getting a negative reaction.   If he's nervous if you're within an inch of his paw, take a step back. Start wherever he's comfortable, it could be two inches, it could be a foot. Calmly, gently, sweetly praise him and offer him a heaping handful of his absolute favorite treats. Do this until he is COMPLETELY comfortable with that step. Then, move forward. You might only be able to get a fraction of an inch closer without any reaction at all, but that's fine. Gradually, you're working to get closer and closer. Practice every single day, several times a day, short, nice sessions.  Some day, you'll be grazing against his paw with your finger. When you're able to be lightly touching it for just a millisecond with him being completely comfortable, touch it lightly for two milliseconds, then three, then four, then five, then six, then eight, then ten, then twelve, then fifteen, and so one. You need to do this in very small increments; if you rush him, you'll take a giant leap backward.  Then, after you can very lightly touch him for some amount of time, you can start using more pressure. Touch him a tiny bit less lightly, then a tiny bit less lightly.  Then, start using more than one finger. Do two, then three, eventually all of them. Then you can spread out your fingers, until you're holding his paw.  Then repeat the process with his other paws.    It might be a very long process, but it's been done before and with a lot of love, patience and effort, you can do it, too.    You can also look into using a Dremel. It won't solve the problem of you being unable to touch him, but it might be a better choice than using clippers. Clippers pinch the nerve inside the claw, and there's always the chance of nicking the quick, which would certainly make him less trusting of you. You would have to desensitize him to the noise and sensation, though, of course. A Dremel is a power tool, and although many people use the normal hardware, they recently released a Dremel specifically for trimming your pet's nails.   Here's a very informational site about Dremeling nails:  http://homepages.udayton.edu/~merensjp/d...    However, I do think you should return him to the shelter in the morning, I suppose. I believe these procedures cost $300 TOPS, and if you don't have even that much in emergency funds for your obviously suffering dog, perhaps you should wait until you're a little more financially stable to own one.  Adopted dogs tend to always be works-in-progress, although the majority are fantastic dogs anyway. I hope you don't expect to change anything more in a mere thirty-six hours?    Good luck.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Your dog won't make the connection watching 2 other dogs get nail trims, that the procedure is alright.  Any vet & technician is more than capable of restraining even the worst dog for a nail trim, muzzled if he has to be.  Once  the nails are clipped, you can spend then next several weeks handling his paws daily, even for just a few seconds, several times a day, without the clippers.

The only thing that will stop this is.....being spayed ( advisable ) or getting pregnant ( NOT advisable )!

Yes, you can have her spayed while she's in heat, but some vets prefer to wait until she is between her heat cycles because of increased chance of bleeding complications. A cat is swollen with blood and more tender during the heat cycle.|`|bxlYleZkaa	a couple of weeks very probably.|`|bN0Imp99aa	Spay your cat then you'll never have to deal with it again.

The wiring travels from the brain to the muscles in the voice box, and this wiring is able to vibrate the muscles so that they act as a valve for air flowing past the voice box. The muscles work both during inhalation and exhalation, which creates the impression that cats can purr continuously. The air passes through the valve, which opens and closes rapidly to create the purring sound."    http://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/qu...    Hope that helps. :)|`|bxlYleZkaa	I wish I knew!

Kittens instinctively purr when nursing, and your adult cat will purr at the drop of a hat whenever you're near. Cat purrs will range from a deep rumble to a raspy, broken sound, to a high-pitched trill, depending on the physiology and/or the mood of a cat. A cat will often "wind-down" when going to sleep, with a long purring sigh that drops melodically from a high to a low pitch. Does your cat purr sound like an idling diesel engine? That's because it's roughly the same velocity--about 26 cycles per second. But I'd much rather hear a cat purr, personally, thank you.

Water down PUPPY kibble (must be puppy or an all life stages formula, NOT adult formula) until it is mush to allow easier eating for such small mouths.  Gradually decrease the amount of water, by 6-8 weeks they should be eating solid, hard kibble.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Great. They're already ahead of schedule. They probably just learned from watching mom. I would just put more in the bowl so they don't eat all of mom's food and let them be. Or put them so food in another bowl and let is soak in warm water.
p3vjvzRPaa	If you got your pup from a good breeder who produces dogs with sound temperaments then there's no reason to suspect your young pup has an agression problem.    It is natural for a pup to question 'who is boss' but you need to address this while he is still young - an adult male rottie with these problems will not be fun or safe for your children.    As a dog trainer, I can tell you that having your husband and kids do some formal obedience work with the pup will help.      Go along to some classes and have one of the kids or your husband handle the dog at the class with the others there watching and learning.    Then at home have each of them do 5 mins of training with the pup each day based on what they learned at the class.    You can also have the other family members involved in feeding, grooming, and walking the pup, and things like putting the pup to bed or sending it out to the toilet - these are all activities that help a dog to bond with and respect a human.  If all the kids ever do with the dog is play, then you can see why the pup thinks of them as just playmates.    There are lots of good books, articles and websites on how to help children and pups interact well.  You could even get a book out from your library.  This website may help you get started:   http://www.canismajor.com/dog/newpup.htm...    The effort and time your family puts in during these critical early months will pay off in a huge way down the track.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Though it seems to yield little benefit for the domesticated dog, canine aggression once served very necessary purposes: hunting down food and protecting territory and other pack members. For the modern dog, aggression toward people still surfaces as a result of a real or perceived threat--and often worsens because our two species don't naturally speak the same language.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=161104830315...    hope this helps.|`|24CFl7sjaa	ok firstly I just want to make it clear that if any of my dogs showed this behavior to my husband or kids I would seek professional advice as soon as I could. This isnt a rant about rotties but they are too big to take a risk with.Your dog has placed himself above your husband and kids in the pack order and this is not to be tolerated, the dog must be submissive to ALL family members. Call a professional handler with experience of this breed ASAP and rectify the problem as a family. Get it sorted while the dog is young, or when he hits maturity you will have a big problem. Good luck,I hope you get him back in line quickly.|`|XEbDgBBUaa	Your rottweiler is probably going to test his limits with everyone in the household.  Your husband needs to be firm and consistent with him as well as your children (if they are old enough, of course).  He is seeing you as the one in charge.  If you plan on getting him neutered, the humping should subside, if not, when he starts doing that, use a firm voice and tell him NO.  Your husband and children should do the same also.  Also, you should start socializing him to halt his aggression toward your children.  Take him to the park, let other children pet him and play with him.  You or your husband should start putting your hands on his face, paying special attention to his snout, so that if and when a child gets to close to his mouth, he will not try to nip.  Hope I could help!
AA10531150	Make sure your cat has a safe haven at the new place.  Like a bathroom where he/she can be without being attacked by the other cat (Also this will not let the other cat feel as threatened and keep it from 'marking' territory').  Leave your cat in this room for a week.  I know its hard but they will be able to sniff each other out thru the bottom of the door.  Also feed them on opposite sides of the door.  Since feeding can be a territorial thing, they'll get used to the scent of each other and wont find it AS threatening when they're co-existing.    After the initial week is up, allow supervised exploration.  Let them sniff and hiss as much as they like while you're there to watch.  When you have to leave or go to sleep, your cat goes back in the bathroom/safe haven.  Let this go on for as long as it takes for them to not go after each other.  There may be hissing but if fur isn't flying you'll be okay.    Good luck!  And please don't get rid of your kitty.  It needs your love.  You adopted it, accepting responsibility.

T11RWeaPaa	are you potty training the puppy on a mat or outside.    Its the same for both anyways.    First.  watch your dog, notice what he does before he goes "potty"  For most dogs, they will sniff the floor, and go in circles looking for the right place. When you see your dog do this, gently pick him up and bring him outside or to his mat. Hold him there for a second then let go, when he goes "potty" Give him a treat, and say "good boy/girl" or praise him/her with petting. Soon your puppy will understand that if he goes in the right place he will get a treat, soon after that, you can stop giving your puppy treats, but he will still go potty there because it is familiar to him!    Good Luck!|`|PrZHEy6taa	Ive found that the best thing to do is take him outside every couple hours and shortly after he eats or drinks something. Crate him at night or gate him into a bathroom with news paper. When he is out in the house with you allow him to wander but follow his every move. If he goes to another room or starts sniffing the floor, circling an area, or acting preoccupied or generally different than usual, follow him closely and only say something like "do you have to go potty". If he begins to squat firmly say NO, grab him and put him outside very quickly. Keep saying gp potty outside, or whatever you will be calling it. He will learn what the words mean. You really need to catch him in the act for him to realize that its not allowed. After a few times he should stop and look at you or give some sign that he knows what you are saying when you keep asking him if he needs to go outside. Then you will be able to notice easier when he shows the signs and you can put him outside.     Keep small training treats near the door. The moment he goes potty outside praise him and give him a treat saying "good potty!"     Persistance is the key. For the first 2 to 3 months you can never let him out of your sight but if you do not let him wander once in a while and sneak to follow him, he may be one of those dogs who will always sneak away to go potty instead of letting you know he needs to go.    Eventually when he acknowledges you when you ask if he needs to go outside, you can go to the door with him and pat the door. Try to get him to jump on the door or give you some other more obvious sign that he needs to go out.     It doesnt take long if you are very persistant and dont give him the chance to go in the house.     At night he is bound to have an accident but you should never yell or disipline him for something he may have done hours ago. This applies to anything. He will not know what he is in trouble for and it only cause fear instead of the respect he should give you.     He may have a few accidents but this is the fastest way to train them. When they have to go they will usually try to leave your sight or the room they are in. If you quietly follow and correct him when he squats he will think he can not go to another room to do it because you will always know.|`|qPIsxtPDaa	Keep an eye on the puppy.. if you don't catch him/her going , immediantly clean it up & also immediantly take the dog outside. Otherwise.. take the dog outside every hour for a bathroom break. If he or she "goes" then say things like "good dog" and so  on. Hope i helped :)|`|GaL66jbQaa	This is not a short answer question, I recommend the book Before and After Getting Your Puppy by Ian Dunbar
3sY0m8HXaa	You will need to continue using the dog food that the dog is currently eating, you can not abruptly switch the dog's food, it will cause stomach issues.  If you would like to use another food you will  need to slowly change the dogs food like mixing the two together for a while. The dogs food depends on age, etc.      Care and Exercise:  Regular brushing with a bristle brush or rubbing down his coat with a chamois will keep the coat shiny and clean. Bath only when necessary. Needs a substantial amount of vigorous exercise which needs to be on-leash. Enjoys running along side a bicycle.    Training:  Training for the American Pit Bull Terrier is extremely important to help the dog become the best family dog he can be. By nature, they are loving, loyal and happy dogs that love doing things with the family. Because of their high intelligence, training them is easy; however, training must be with a firm voice. They need consistency in the training and need to know what is expected of them. Any physical punishment will only make the dog upset and will not accomplish anything. They are very clever dogs and will try to get away with as much as they can (as is the case with most dogs!).    Because of their nature bred prey drive, it is very important to socialize them with other animals regularly from a young age if they are expected to coexist with that animal regularly.|`|RyNvYrJmaa	when i think of pitbulls the number 1 thing i think of is extremely sensitive skin..alot of the ones that come into my work are pink where they should be white and have terrible coats..there are a few gorgeous ones though, just find a good breeder and make sure you see the parents before you decide. feed a high quality food designed for sensitive skin/allergies.    then of course theres the tendency towards aggression with an unexperienced/unauthoratative owner, so definitely make sure you establish early on who the boss is. give them an inch- they take a mile when it comes to dominance!|`|CHPuhiOyaa	Realize that this is a very big decision you're making, first of all. The breed is very much in trouble and another bad owner is all it takes for BSL to take place in your city.     So, either buy from a reputable breeder or adopt from the pound and make sure they have assessed the dog. With all these backyard breedings, bad genes will produce an unsound dog. Also, note that pitbulls ARE dog aggressive (i.e. not human aggressive). So prepare for that.    For dog food, don't buy the commercial dog food in supermarkets. You'll have to do your research on this one, sorry.     For training, make SURE you take puppy classes, even if it's just at Petsmart. Training will go a long way with these dogs. Always use positive reinforcement and remember that a scared/fearful pit bull is a dangerous pit bull. Good luck!|`|Wwpqwkkiaa	Lots have bitten people if poorly trained if you dont have time, do not get a pit bull if you search pit bull attacks you will get a billion attacks please take good care of him if you get one, other than that they are really sweet dogs|`|7FQH8pcYaa	I raise pure bred papered pit bull terriers strictly for Competition, they need more training than any other dog, they are very loyal to there owners so they should be socialized with other people and dogs. there are lots of web site out their so start studying up as much as possible.

ngebYukSaa	well firstly, you cannot change fat into muscle. You can only LOSE fat and build up muscle. They are 2 different cell types.    The principle is the same as for humans when it comes to losing weight and building muscle tone. If kilojoules eaten = kilojoules burnt through exercise, then your kitty will maintain weight. If you want her to lose weight, she has to exercise!    Get her some play toys, encourage her to go for walks, play games with her. Get her a cat tree (the ones covered in carpet) that she can climb, to help her build muscle. If she goes outside, see if she will run. (my cat will chase anything)    With the diet, ensure you cut down to the recommended dietary intake. Ask your vet for advice if you need it. Dont feed your kitty cows milk products, or cheese or fat off the steaks etc Cats are lactose intolerant and can only drink milk specific for cats. Also note chocolate can be deadly and so can onions (not that i think anyone would feed their cat onions!)    Ignore their pitiful meows when they beg for more food (difficult!) Be strict and your kitty will soon be fighting fit!    hope she's alright!|`|gM7VuCM4aa	You can't build fat into muscle in anything. Fat is fat and muscle is muscle.

cnZlMojUaa	I felt the same way when we brought our rescue home. We had searched for 8-9 months to find her. I was so afraid and nervous, but happy and excited at the same time. She was 4 and I was worried that as an adult she wouldn't bond with us (she did). I was nervous that our 6 year-old male would fight with her (he didn't). I think I worried so much about the potential problems that I stressed myself out. I even worried that she wouldn't be the specific breed we wanted--we adopted sight-unseen. All my fears and worries vanished when I saw her and was able to hold her in my arms the first time. We shared almost 7 wonderful years together and she will always have a place in my heart.    I think your feelings are normal. You are so excited about your new family member, yet nervous because you really want to make sure you do everything right. Enjoy your new dog. The first few months are very special, regardless of the dog's age. This is the time that you earn each other's trust and really fall in love. Yes, you will look into those eyes and feel love, but it is more the infatuation "crush" type love. The real thing will blossom and grow throughout your dog's life. All my best!|`|fP0C9s8daa	When I first bought mine, I was stressed out .  I was always thinking to myself, "Is this the dog I really want?"  As soon as I bought my dog, I didn't like him that much .

vTfEYeKQaa	Perhaps there is a spirit in your house. I don't know if you believe in ghosts/spirits, but I do....animals are really sensitive to the paranormal stuff, just like children.  Maybe the dog senses the other dog is still there...or it could even be a child spirit playing with the dog. Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there.  Look it up online, I guarantee you'll find a ton of stories about this.  Just a thought though, I know not everyone believes in the paranormal stuff. Maybe she's just playing with the memory of her sibling.

IMPvzBk1aa	This link is to an article that offers a detailed description of what really goes into making a good hoof.  On the outside, the fronts should appear more rounded, and the rears are more elongated from back to front.  The structures should be hard and dry and intact, and the soles thick and calloused to handle all terrain. The toes in front of the frog should not extend more than 1/3 of the length from toe to heel.  This means that the frog takes up 2/3 of that length.  If you have time, read the link which explains how and why exercise in a young horse is so vital to developing a healthy hoof for life.     http://www.thehorseshoof.com/Art_Bowker....|`|3O2SfwIBaa	hoove's should be symmetrical and the same shape as the one next to it. they should have low heels so that the pedal bone is paralle to the ground. they should be of a 45 degree slope or around that with the same angle as the shoulder and the pastern. under neath they should be level with a big frog and small bars. it's probably best to direct you to sites such as the bare foot horse and jamie jackson has taken some shots of mustangs with perfect bare hooves so you can get an idea from that. hope i've helped|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	Good qualities of a hoof are that it is healthy and strong and well-conformed.  A nice sturdy hoof wall should be thick, not brittle or mushy, and should have the overall consistency of hard rubber like a hockey puck.      I have found black hooves to be strong than lighter colored ones.  Some may view this as a wive's tale, but I have found it to be true in my experience with horses.      Most of the time unhealthy hooves are a result of insuffiecient nutrition and poor care, whether it be neglect or ill-fitting shoes, etc.  Good hooves are a result of good breeding, nature, good nutrition, and proper care.

They really aren't effective at all.  At the same time, some of the questions they ask are questions that can help you decide what breeds to avoid...    http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...|`|iMOePEWlaa	go to animal planet .com and look for the dog breed selector.  it can help,but ultametly the desition is up to you.|`|GUEsVdaFaa	I don't know of any quizzes but I do know of a great site that will tell you all about each breed and what some of their qualities are. They even have a page that rates each breed on a scale of 1-5 for how they rate with kids. My advice would be, use this site, Google, and the AKC site to research your top 5 breeds. Compare their breed qualities, and pick the one that you think will best suit you and make the best match. And don't pick the one that's cutest because no matter how cute they are you just might not be compatible.
MX9M36B4aa	I have been breeding and raising them for about twelve years now and can tell you first hand if you provide the proper lighting and food and vitamins then you should not have any problems.The main thing you will need to remember is you need a UVB bulb and a basking bulb for lighting,and as long as the cage does not drop below 68 then you will not need to provide a nite glow.And also a very big thing is fresh veggies each day and live crickets or other bugs dusted with d3 powder.If you follow thes main rules then you will have no problems.I hope you enjoy yours as much as i enjoy mine:)Oh ya and happy birthday;)|`|42cQpxviaa	Apparently they do, because I have this family friend who used to breed them; and she told me that one day they all just died. at the same time. So one of them got a virus and it just spread to all of them immediately. But just do the right research and learn how to take care of it; if you're devoted and responsible you'll be fine. Bearded dragons are pretty cool too. I wish my dad would let me get a pet, lucky.|`|eS8wuYRfaa	As long as you take care of them properly, I find them to be pretty hardy critters.  Usually, when they get sick, it's a problem with their housing..improper lighting, improper heating, etc..   They can be kinda tough to set up, but then they are fairly easy to care for.|`|p6I881Lwaa	Um, i think it depends on the pet. Like humans, we are all different. I have a beardie named Fred, and there was this one time when it was very cold and freezing outside, and even our room temperature was low. I didn't pay attention to the temperature inside his glass tank (which is supposed to be at least 82 degrees) and a day after that, he had a little mucus fluid or saliva coming out of the corner of his mouth. His skin on his head became bleak and whiter, although by the end we discovered that it was a coincidence with his skin shedding process. No, in several days he was back to normal, because I kept both of the terarium lamps on (there's supposed to be two). Just keep him warm. He's a nice creature!|`|vV425TqZaa	The answer is this, they can get sick but not as easy as your friend has told you, if they do get sick signs are not easy to find because bearded dragons are strong when it comes to showing symptoms.|`|vMXk9ohSaa	We got one when he was ten years old.  One guy had had him since high school.  We had him another two years when he just stopped eating and passed away.  We were feeding him crickets by hand at the end and put the calcium on them and everything.  Didn't think it was serious (thought it was a winter-hiberntation kind of thing, but it wasn't) or we'd have taken him to a reptile vet.  (Locate one before you get him so you'll know where to go in an emergency.)|`|OGLulBtwaa	Get an older one. They're slightly more expensive but its worth the heart ache of your baby bearded dragon dying. I'm not sure how old this turns out to be, but the length of your forearm is maybe 2 years? They're still as cute as the babies and you'll have time to bond with them. But I found a full grown one in the street one day and we kept her for like 3 years (until she ran away) and she was so loving even though we got her later in life.|`|6puzMUP1aa	i got a bearded dragon for my sweet sixteen (bought all the supplies my self) and she is the sweetest thing ever! she gets along with my cat and dogs and anyone that she comes into contact with. i got her as a baby and she is as happy and healthy as ever. everyone loves her. her birthday is nine days after mine which makes her birthday the 17th of August and mine the 8th of August. i'm not sure what i will do with her once i go to college because it's a two hour drive there and two hours back. she is not telling you the truth the only time that they get sick is if they don't have the right things that they need to survive for example: they need uvb lights, heat lamps, pure calcium (no d3 or phospherous), and a multi vitamin, crickets, and veggies.
uuudmeyyaa	Find a local dog trainer that uses positive reinforcement techniques. It won't be very cheap, but it will solve your problems the correct way, and if you can afford 2 dogs you can surely afford the proper training!|`|HKoo2PfYaa	Wow, you certainly have your hands full - I remember what that was like!    Obedience training for dog behavior improvement is an important and critical part of responsible dog ownership. Learning effective dog training techniques will lay the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. You will feel at ease at all times that your pet will be well-behaved, will not be a danger to other people or other dogs, and will consistently obey your commands.    Dogs by instinct and genetics have a pack mentality. In the wild, a few will elevate to the leader of the pack, but most will be a follower. So it is quite natural for your dog to learn to follow your lead and instruction. That's what they would normally do in the wild.    Obedience training for dog behavior improvement requires that you take charge of your relationship with your dog.  You must always be the leader. In the process of loving your dog and showing him or her affection, never forget that you are the leader. This is where many dog training models go astray. It is imperative for your dog to recognize his place in your relationship. (see source!!)    Learning dog training techniques provides an amazing sense of confidence and competence in yourself as a responsible dog owner. You can be confident that you know how your dog will react in virtually any situation and circumstance. It's a confidence that your dog will obey your every command and actually enjoy doing so.    A dog that's easily distracted and doesn't obey your commands can be a danger to himself as well as to other people. If you own an out-of-control dog and you see him running out into a busy street, there is absolutely nothing you can do. But an effectively trained pet who is trained to stay by his owner's side doesn't even think of running out into the street.    It has been proven that obedience training for dog behavior is very mentally stimulating for a dog and helps to create a well-adjusted and happier dog. A happy well-adjusted dog will always have less dog behavior problems for you to deal with.    I hope I have provided you with some material to think about - it is a long road, but in the end, if done properly, you will have an awesome relationship with your new dog and I wish you two the best!|`|GUEsVdaFaa	For the potty training: Try taking her out every hour on the hour and don't bring her back inside until she potties! And as soon as she finishes pottying give her a tasty snack and reward and praise her. The best way to potty train is to prevent accidents, so if you can, get some pet scent remover and clean your house from top to bottom. Wal-Mart has some stuff called "OUT! Natural" and it works very well. It smells like lemons and herbs and it also removes stains. Then, if you can, get pee-pee pads. LOTS of them. Line your entire floor with them if you have to securing the seams with scotch tape. Only replace the ones she potties on daily. Leave the rest. After while you can start removing them one at a time until there are only a few left. It sounds complicated but it works. Most people use this trick for small rooms like a bath room or bedroom they have to leave the dog in when they go somewhere. Sooner or later she'll get down to just pottying on one pad, and then you slowly move it a few inches towards your door every day. Then move it outside. You should never punish a puppy for pottying in the house, only prevent it, and reward them for going in the proper place. And don't clean up the mess when they're watching. It's like a mind game for them.    For the chewing: Get her rawhide toys, bones, Greenies, rope toys, balls, squeaky toys and anything else you find at the store that's made for dogs and she might enjoy. Give her 2 or 3 a day, and rotate them so she only has the same ones for a day or two and she won't get bored with them. I understand you're against physical punishment, but really you should try using a loud newspaper or paper towel roll (that's empty of course), or an envelope with the plastic window thing in it. Just something that makes a lot of noise but doesn't cause pain. I found the envelope works best. Keep a very good eye on her at all times, and when you see he headed for something she shouldn't have tell her NO! If you can stop her before she gets to it that really speeds up the training. If not it's okay, just tell her no, and if she doesn't respond, tell her a second time and follow up with the paper.     For the crate training: It's best to work on this when you leave the house and no one is around. Doing it at night keeps everyone up and it's just annoying. Put her in the crate, and cover it with an old blanket so she can't see you leaving. When you leave it doesn't matter how much she cries, she'll take the hint that crying won't get her her way. And whatever you do, never ever ever let her out of the crate while she's crying. This enforces the behavior and you'll never get her trained to sit there without crying. If you can't get her to quiet right before you take her out, make a loud noise like clapping your hands and as soon as she's quiet you can let her out.    I hope it all works out for you... if you need any more help feel free to e-mail me. I can look up some of the sites I got my training info for you. Oh, and Bull Dogs are very stubborn by nature, they take longer than some breeds to catch on to and respond to training.|`|wc9viY4Saa	What I have found to be effective in showing dominance to a dog is...now this might sound cruel, abusive etc...but it does work. When a dog is trying to be dominant and will not listen, I carefully grab it and make it lie on its back with my hand around it's neck (not much pressure) using my fingers as teeth (I chew on his neck) I make sure that they stay on their back until they stop wiggling which is a sign of defeat and submission. I have just shown my dominance over the dog. You must be as gentle as possible in this manoeuvre because you can cause harm to the dog. If the first try does not succeed..and the dog gets up, do it until it works..Meaning, until the dog gets so tired it is possible to accomplish. In nature, when dogs compete for dominance, it's a challenge until one of the dogs surrenders.   When you bring her outside, tell her to go pee, or use whatever words you want her to learn by. If you know her habits, when you come back in from your walks, time it...5 min later, you bring her outside and tell her the magic word. Don't give in, you are the boss.|`|9AHTNcanaa	It sounds like you have stumbled upon a very difficult puppy.  (I feel your pain...my lab pulled to metal bars of her cage apart too!)  I find when I am training dogs being clear, patient, and consistent are the most important things.  You are basically trying to communicate with the equivalent of a 3yr. old kid that grew up speaking a foreign language. My best tip I can give you is to use different tones and pitches of my voice to get my point across. (I also use play and treats when working on specific commands.) Just think of natural dog behavior:     Low, slow and firm= Hey, I don't like what you are doing   High, loud and short= Pay attention or Ouch!  High pitch and friendly = You are being very good    Physical contact= play (in her mind) = good job  No physical contact= no play= not a good job      Now, specifically for potty training, the method I use is simple, but requires a lot of diligence on your part:      1.  Take the dog out every 2 hrs and walk her around outside (if you have        an enclosed yard it might be good to even let her of the leash since some     dogs won't pee while on it)  Have treats or her favorite toy with you so     that if she pees you can immediately reward her. I will even start praising     them once I see them in the act of doing their business (see note above     about tone of voice)      2. While you are just hanging out inside with your pup watch her like a     hawk!  If she is going to have an accident in the house you want to catch     her in the act. After the fact is too late...their ability to put past action and     consequence together is not really there... When you do catch her, go     ahead and tell her "No", "Hey" or "Ah,Ah" in low, quick and firm voice (gets     their attention and tells them you are not happy).  At the same time pick     them up (even if she is still peeing) and get her outside to where she     should be peeing. Hopefully when you get her out there she still has some     left and will finish up outdoors so you can praise her.  Unfortunately, it may     take a couple of accidents before she gets it.        3.  If she still refuses to pee outside try training her with a puppy pad.  You     can use it as training wheels to transition her into peeing outside. (Train her     to pee on pad then move pad outside.  Then wean her off the pad.)      **4. Also get her checked out for a UTI or vaginitis.  These are two VERY     common infection that female puppies are prone to that can interfere     significantly with potty training.    Crate training is not super fun either thanks to the crying.  Start off by putting the dog in the crate and making sure its comfortable and in a quiet room where she can see people walking around.  You want her to think of it as "her room" ... "her safe place."  I will even put a little kibble in a bowl or a dentabone in there with her to keep her busy and a blanket over the cage for the solitude.  Now when she starts crying, try to ignore it as long as possible.  If she stops crying for a significant amount of time (this might only be 1 min in the beginning...but should increase) praise and reward her by letting her out.  Should she start crying before you let her out. close the cage and calmly walk out again until she calms down.  Now, if she doesn't ever stop crying you can try the loud sharp "Ah, ah" to see if you can get her attention, (but if she is really worked up like my cocker spaniel gets it won't phase her).  I would suggest putting her in her cage without a blanket over it and leaving the room so that she can see you leave.  Stand just outside the  closed door and count to 15 then re-enter.  Do this a few times so that she knows that when you leave you are coming back.  Slowly increase the count that you are outside.  If while you are counting you hear her calming down re-enter and praise her.  Eventually you should be able increase the calm time it requires for you to re-enter the room.  Finally you should be able to pick up where the original training technique began. Don't expect her to necessarily learn this one in one day.  If you notice her getting too worked up try to pick a good note to end on for the day...then try again tomorrow.    As for the chewing things up, again diligence and patience is the key.  Destructive chewing is often a sign of boredom.  With my dog and other dogs I have trained, I have found that making sure the dog gets at least an hour long walk/ playtime cuts down on the destructiveness immensely!!!  If you don't have time for this see if there are any dog savy kids in your area looking to make an extra $5 or $10.  The idea is to stimulate your dog...so be sure to switch up the activities as well.  Walk in the park one day, then have a play date with a friends dog another day. (Its a great excuse to have people over for drinks!) The time can even be spent learning a new trick/job (my personal favorite is "drop it"/ "leave it"...it makes for a very nice game to them).    Ok...one last tip.. make sure that anytime you do take something out away or out of their mouth that they shouldn't have replace it with something that they can have.  If your dog is young the chew could be due to teething so you don't want to eliminate chewing all together.  My dog (who can destroy anything we give her) LOVES this toy... http://www.amazon.com/Nylabone-Dental-Di...           Dog training is not always an easy thing, and each dog responds differently to different techniques. Don't give up hope! If my suggestion don't help I recommend looking in to some in person professional help. Even if you find out you are right on track, just the repetition of going to classes will help tea
EKg97zZlaa	yes it is true,fish need rest too turning the light of at night will...    a)slow the growth of algea  b)calm them down/keep their stress levels down  c)it will make tank life more like the wild,fish in the wild are 75% healthier then fish in tanks,and that's how they are used to it so you shouldn't change their sleep/rest patterns    think of it this way... would you like it if you had to sleep with a spotlight shining in you eyes?,NO,so do you think your fish would like it,NO!!!!!!!!!!    bottom line...  fish need sleep too,turn the light off at night!|`|ohxiNOFjaa	Yes they need a rest cycle.  Leaving the light on 24/7 is stressful.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	I didn't know that they really cared. We usually leave a small light on above their tank.|`|iOuTyHDWaa	everyone is right....the fish rest in the dark....and nocturnal behavior is initiated in darkness...especially if you get a moonlight for night time. So, make sure that the nocturnal events do not result in fish murders in the morning....or get another tank for more aggressive fish!|`|MG2jo26Oaa	Yes! You should always turn the light off at night. Ideally, at least in my opinion, the light should go off when the sun goes down and it should come on when the sun comes up.|`|tDcItiATaa	You really should not have the lights on any longer than any 12 hour period. 8-12 hours a day is ideal. Any longer and you will encourage allot of algae growth and eventually the fish will suffer from stress. The stress the fish will eventually suffer would more than likely lea to a disease of some sort. Fish do require a period of darkness, especially if you have any nocturnal fish, they will be under stress more so. Other than that if you have natural aquatic plants, the long lighting periods would do damage to them also.  Try and keep in mind of how much natural light source there is in there natural environment.    hope this helps.|`|91Yhm4Xjaa	some sure do like the light off...some nocturnals like my BGK enojy no light so hecan swim around like crazy in the dark  its good to let them rest in whatever natural light there is|`|dXcm5971aa	yep, it relaxes them|`|uPTJM3m9aa	yeah !!  they do i hate the dark|`|hVjxNhJWaa	YES, turn the light off, they will love you for it.|`|TYohMrlXaa	Yes, very much so. Fish do not have eyelids. They will very much appreciate a dark tank at nighttime when they rest.    10-12 hours of light a day would be perfect. Also when you turn them back on in the morning, its nice to turn the room lights up first so the sudden change isn't as jarring.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Yes, turn the lights off at night, fish need a sense of day and night too.
8owlj2xHaa	If your snails and crab are doing fine, then my guess is it may be how you acclimate the fish to the tank. Snails and crabs are much less tolerant of poor water conditions than fish.  One of the hardest things for fish to adapt to is the salinity level. Most fish stores keep theres very low because its cheaper and parasites do not do well in low salinity water. If your tanks salt level is much different than your fish stores then you need to make sure you do a very good drip acclimation for a long time 2hours . You say your salinity if fine, if using a hydrometer take it to the fish store and ask them to check it. They are very in accurate.  Do invest in a rodi filter though.   http://www.liveaquaria.com/general/gener...|`|urIm4YaBaa	It isn't the water quality and it isn't metal poisoning. Your crabs and snails would have been the first die if that was the case. Ditto with electrical discharges that a grounding probe could have caused (the people at your lfs should have known that before recommending the purchase...although a grounding probe is a good thing to have to protect yourself from electrocution).    The "freshwater power filter" also isn't a problem. They don't make special kinds of power filters for freshwater use and other special kinds for marine use, as they all use the exact same principles and mechanics. You can't get a "wrong kind" of power filter. Anybody who tells you otherwise is either trying to sell you something on bad information, or he himself was duped on this marketing ploy.    The green stuff at the bottom is probably a form of cyanobacteria growth, also known as slime algae. It's usually red, but it has been known to appear green at times. The best you can do is increase the flow in the areas where you're seeing it, possibly by repositioning the powerheads or buying a new tiny powerheads aimed at the area where the growth takes place. In the meantime, siphon up as much as you can and perform a water change to reduce some of the phosphates and nitrates. If you aren't running a protein skimmer, you might consider picking one up; they won't solve algae problems, but they can help.     Because the invertebrates are fine, it's hard to say that this is an environmental or water quality problem. I'm guessing it's the fish itself that has problems. Is the fish eating regularly? How did the fish acclimate to the water? Also, how are you selecting livestock at the store? What are you looking for in a fish? How do you ensure that it's healthy? What questions do you ask?     Also, how long did you wait before adding the damsel? If the clownfish died of a parasite or disease, the damsel may have caught the same conditions, while the invertebrates may not have been a suitable host for the infection. The best you can do to avoid this in the future is to run a quarantine for all new purchases and to use it as a sick tank when a fish becomes ill.  This can help ensure that you aren't putting a sick animal in your display tank in the first place.|`|6jtU5fztaa	the problem is you are not supposed to make a saltwater using conditioned tap, you buy the water at your LSFS (local saltwater fish store)     the water shouldnt be too expensive at all, maybe like a buck a gallon, its around 90 cents a gal at my LSFS|`|EyKJ737daa	I would say that tap water in your problem there.  I don't believe doing a major water change would fix the problem, in fact it may very well make it worse for the surviving fish.  Chances are the green stuff is algae, some fish love it others don't and is toxic for them.  I'd speak to your fish shop and see what they suggest for further fixing of the tank.  Good luck though, sounds like it's going to be an awesome tank when completed though, all the best.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	2 things you don't mention    What is the water temperature as checked by a thermometer, not your heater setting?  Heaters can malfunction and make the water warmer than it should be.  Warm water holds less oxygen and makes the fish work harder to breathe.    Did your fish show these symptoms where you bought them?  If everything else is perfect, your fish might have a disease or parasite infecting their gills.  As the gills are covered by them, or excessive slime coat that the fish makes to keep the disease organisms or parasites from attaching, it makes breathing harder for the fish.    This has some information about 3 of the most common saltwater diseases, including symptoms and treatment.  http://www.pets-warehouse.com/marinefish...    If you used a water conditioner that neutralizes heavy metals, then those shouldn't be a problem.  The only thing from your filter that would *release* anything back into the tank would be carbon if it's left in too long.  If you use carbon [not all fishkeepers do on a regular basis, it's most useful to remove medicine or discoloration from wood], and it's been in the tank for more than a month, change it, or remove it.|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Yep tap water is your problem. Invest in a RO filter or get the Ro from a good pet store..
kNhYFgCTaa	lol i cant really tell you why exactly cats do it, but I know my cats would chase and eliminate ALL flys that ever entered my house. I guess they like playing with bugs.       but i guess its quite normal, they are very playful and curious. especially with things they havent seen all that much before.|`|wc9viY4Saa	My cats and dogs do the same thing. I think it's because they're so small and fast. The ants go in any direction and the animals seem confused and interested at the same time. Beware though!

I've seen a few and yours definitely looks like it.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Your dog is either one & could be a mix of both breeds.  No pet store is considered reputable in selling of pets. Since your dog is very likely from a puppy mill, there is not telling what the truth is. It doesn't matter now unless you are planning on taking him back otherwise he is your dog. That 1st pic makes him look more like a pom mix than the others you showed which he looked more like lh chi mix. Sorry but you got taken & never buy from a pet store or byb if you want purebred & good quality no matter what you pay.|`|gjD8pndjaa	No such thing as a credible pet store, really.  You have no idea what you got, unfortunately.  Could be a poorly bred pom or chi or a mix of who knows what.

Not even a pet quality, or poorly bred pom.  There is no such thing as a credible pet store that sells puppies.  Plus, they get their puppies from puppy mills and they are real crooks.

But you do have a loving family member.|`|jtjISk6qaa	looks like a pom to me|`|lMYuPrhIaa	This is the second time i've answered this question.    I believe that it is a Pomeranian. I have a 9 month old Pomeranian puppy, that looks similar to that. His fur looks almost identical and his fur lays on his back like that.    It doesn't matter as long as you love him though! Rather if he is a mutt, a chi, a pom or any other breed, just love him unconditionaly!|`|jWmnSXlLaa	You already asked this and got tons of replys.

Any way, he appears to have been poorly bred.  Why would anyone pay that much money for a mix that you can find dozens of in shelters?  I'm not trying to be ugly here, but I really think you got cheated.  He's cute as can be though!|`|9sGC6P92aa	I'm completely positive your dog is not a Chihuahua or pomeranian. I'm not sure what it is exactly but i would imagine it has some sort of papillon in it. He has the ears and nose of a papillon but the coloring is off and the body structure is different.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	your dog is not a pom or a chi...i have owned both he looks like a mutt to me...he could be a pom/chi mix...there ya go best of both worlds right haha
RyNvYrJmaa	eventually it will probably get much better, but it still smells pretty bad! as long as he covers it in the litterbox and doesn't spray you probably wont even notice the smell in a few more weeks when his hormones have completely left his system|`|LM7DWcdlaa	Yes it will. It will subside a bit, but all urine, especially male cats, is strong. Let the hormones exit his system, and give him a steady diet. Also, he may be dehydrated. Make sure he gets plenty of water.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Yes,it will go away eventually.It takes a while for all of the hormones to leave their body.
DuUEYkCZaa	I have  a long haired cat,she is about 1 year,some  jacka$$  dropped  her off in my yard  Christmas time 07, she is a house cat and she  seems to love the water,every day when I am in the shower she wants to be in it with me. So my house cat doesn't seem to be skittish around water.|`|uuudmeyyaa	They NEED to drink it, pretty much all living creatures NEED water to survive.     However, cats don't NEED to get wet. In fact many of them HATE being wet.     Some don't... my mom's cat will jump in a sink full of water and splash around. My cat will claw your eyes out if you set her within 3 feet of water that isn't in her drinking bowl.|`|57fZyjvgaa	My two like to sit IN the bathtub (after it's drained, but while it's still wet).   Yesterday one even got IN the shower while it was running! She didn't get in the direct spray of the water but she did a complete circle around the shower and jumped out completely wet.  The other one gets on the toilet seat, puts her front paws IN the toilet (you know on the slant before the water) and drinks from the toilet. It's disgusting. I try to make everyone keep the lids down because then we have brown paw prints on the seat. ick.  They're also both fascinated with faucets and like to stick their paws in it.  But... they're teenagers, so perhaps they'll grow out of it.|`|wc9viY4Saa	Mine like to sit on the edge of the bathtub...|`|BhYwYzuDaa	That is soo not true! Ive seen cats on youtube that swim in bathtubs and bathe in sinks all by themselves if the water is comfortable.|`|a08048d1e82b1272f6271db826631a22aa	Many cat breeds have coats which trap water, so getting wet ruins the ability of the cat to keep itself warm in cool weather. Cats also do not like being splashed with water around the face, as water can hurt their sensitive ears and potentially cause an infection as well. However, some domestic cat breeds like the Bengal and the Turkish Van are famous for liking water, and they will play with it and sometimes even swim. It is possible that these cats like water because of the areas where they evolved, where they may have been forced to swim to find food.
3AAtPzSaaa	why woudl you sell your dog!  seriously, you buy it and its a life long committment.  your a terrible owner.|`|Mrs4JG9taa	NOT HERE.  GET OFF THIS WEBSITE|`|jWmnSXlLaa	newspapers,flyers, turn off your caps !!|`|7IVrBiT1aa	petfinder.com|`|kBjzKyZyaa	puppyfind.com or try your local tv stations website most of the larger stations have classifieds|`|HS5ZSdd0aa	Okay, first of all if you cared about your dog you would not try to sell it over the internet.    Second of all if I was a person selling my dog I would not want someone to buy it from me from an ad I placed in the newspaper or pennysaver.  I would want a responsible dog owner to buy my dog.    My suggestion contact local breeders of your breed.  If you have a purebred dog that is recognized by the American Kennel Club got to www.infodog.com and find a local dog show to go to and talk to some breeders about helping you find a suitable home.  Or if you are located in another country they all have national Clubs that sanction dog shows.  Trust me as someone who has shown and bred dogs for 12 years it is a tight little network that reaches from coast to coast and even continent to continent.    Or if that seems like to much work contact the breeder.  I am assuming there is a breeder because you can't sell a mix breed dog.  You can place into a good home (letting someone have it for free) or relinquish your rights to ownership of the dog to an animal shelter.    I understand that dogs can turn out to be to much work and maintnace than some realize or that life events make it impossible to give your dog the loving home it deserves.  But I am asking and begging you to not just sell your dog to anybody who is willing to pay what ever sum of money you are asking.  I've had people willing to spend $2500 on some of my puppies and I would not sell to them because I believed that it was not the best place for them to live.  Other times I have sold that $2500 puppy for $800 or less because I found a loving and suitable home and was willing to ensure my dogs well-being instead of trying to get the biggest profit.|`|Fy1o8loeaa	puppyfiner.com|`|ebJ02QZJaa	If it is full-blooded (which I would assume as you pretty much can't sell just a regular old dog), the people you got if from may take it back.  A lot of sellers even have in the contract that if you don't keep the dog, it has to go back to them.  Either way, I would contact them.  They probably mostly deal in selling puppies and may have a client that wants a grown dog.  You never know.  Worth a shot.    Not sure why Craigslist won't let you do it.  It's done all the time on the local Craigslist ads here.|`|1r6neKCHaa	try petfinder.com and kijiji.com and craigeslist.com|`|f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	Poor thing, I hope you concentrate more on finding a loving home rather than what you can sell  him for.  Petfinder.com will allow you to place your pet on their site for adoption, but perhaps you could find a loving home locally, one where a person could come and visit with your dog, and make sure the relationship would be a forever loving home for him.

LAXxaxAZaa	She's most likely either sun bleached, or has a light winter coat.    Most products for color are safe to use on pintos (shampoos, supplements, etc.)    You can turn her out at night, put a sheet on her when she's out during the day, give her Black-As-Knight, use sunblock spray, or you can start using a darkening shampoo on her black spots.|`|9UttDvcsaa	Turn her out at night if you want her black again.  She is probably sun bleached.  Stop using the white and bright on her maybe it is spreading over her skin and lightening the black patches.  There is really nothing you can do to make her black again unless she stays out of the sun.|`|Yvamytrzaa	Well, first off some people cant see the pic if they don't have a myspace because you have your profile on private. But anyways, i have a tri colored tobiano paint and i use white 'n bright shampoo, too. My gelding has never faded out by the shampoo. It could be from the sun. I hope this helps a little bit.|`|lu4ufhm5aa	well your photo is private..|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	i would say sun bleached for sure, turn her out at right or light rug her during the day im sure you will see a huge improvement|`|ajj7ATyAaa	Cant see your picture- you have to be friends with a person on Myspace before they can access your albums... Maybe try a photobucket account. Those can be accessed publicly...    Most whitening shampoos do not contain a bleaching agent.  Instead, they rely on purple/blue tones of the shampoo to brighten white. It should have no effect on the dark coat.    It's normal for the horse to not have good color to their winter coat.  Mine look a shade lighter in the winter, as is the case in almost every horse I've ever met.  Adding cocosoya oil to the feed can improve the coat's quality/sheen, as can really thorough grooming with lots of rubbing.  But if it's just a color change with the winter coat, and you continue what you were doing last year to have a nice healthy coat, it'll probably be right as rain when she sheds out.
veDvtYhJaa	That's a painful lesson.    It doesn't do any good for me to tell you the dog will be ok, as I have no way of knowing any more than you do.  You paid your vet for services; you should ask your vet tomorrow morning since you didn't do so today.    All that sugar was toxic, and how your dog does depends on it's will to fight the illness, and it's general health.  Your sister had better not make that mistake again, and, if the dog survives, you had better train the dog so it doesn't get up on the table to steal food.  Meanwhile, don't leave things around.    I'll pray that your dog survives without any serious problems. -!-|`|3AAtPzSaaa	poor dogs!  be careful next time chocolate can kill dogs.....(im serious)  just do what the vet said anad shoudl be sweet.|`|Mrs4JG9taa	Please be a responsible owner and don't let your dogs eat what they're not supposed to.|`|b517f85a077ee78e82ea191b09ce0d96aa	Your vet knows what he is doing. I worked at my vet's office for a while, and we had a few "My dog ate something bad" cases, and they were always fine. My guess is the IV is to keep them from getting dehydrated as they pass the candy. I wouldn't worry too much! They're probably wishing they could be at home instead of at the vet's office!!|`|AA10832878	Okay, if you mean chocolate candy, yes they will get sick. If you meant "dark" chocolate, they can die from it. Dark chocolate "can" be fatal if they eat enough of it. If it's been a few days, and your dogs are still alive, they will more than likely make it through this, they'll just be sick to their stomachs for a while. Also you don't say what size these dogs are. If a large dog eats a half of a candy bar of dark chocolate, he'll get sick to his stomach, but should make it through it. If a small dog eats that same amount of dark chocolate, it could be fatal. It also depends on how fast you got them to the vet. But from what you say, this happened a couple of days or so ago, and I think they will make it. Just remember not to leave any dark chocolate laying around, and tell anyone who enters your house, the same thing. Good luck.
uuudmeyyaa	This is an instinct from birth. When cats are tiny little kittens, that "kneading bread" action can stimulate the mother cat to produce more milk, so they do it while they are suckling.     This instinct carries over to adulthood, and cats usually do this action when they are very happy and purring. My guess as to why they do it when they are adults: The fact they are happy and feel good probably links somewhere in the brain to a memory of being little and having a protective safe mother feeding them, so it triggers the instinctual response to "knead."|`|KQMhCV49aa	my cat does it to it's a way to show affecttion|`|ZZJKTV8laa	hahahaa i LOVE that my cat does that. we have these 2 blankets she does it on and whenever we want her to cuddle we just throw the bllanket on the bed and put her up there and tell her to take a bite and she does it forever and stays with us. i know it is some thing to do with feeding from their mother i read about it in a book. i think its really cute that some do that
wZKb8egaaa	If the tank is warm enough then you can get by with a heat pad alone, but like the guy above said you wont see your snake very often because it'll want to be over the heat. But, if you do decide to get a lamp watch the heat. Some lamps get way too hot.  And snakes don't need UVB light. They get their nutrients and vitamins from the mice/rats that you feed them so don't waste your money on UVB. Also most snakes are nocturnal (the are awake at night) so they wont be out much anyway. UVB is only for herbivore/omnivore lizards snakes don't need it.    P.S. Heat rocks burn reptiles real easily. And Never put the the heat pad under the water bowl. If you need to raise the humidity mist the tank twice a day with a squirt bottle.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	yes if the basking areas temperature is high enough u can get away with just a heatpad snakes dont need UVB lighting snakes get there calcium and D3 from there food and balls can be very sensitive to high levels of uvb it hurts there eyes stresses them out sometimes cause skin damage u dont need it.|`|MX9M36B4aa	For a python you picked the rite heat pad but i do need to tell you that the pet store was not trying to scam you out of more money.I have owned snakes for well over 15yrs now and can tell you first hand if you go with only a heat pad you will never see your snake he will only burro because ther is nothing to bask under.Also i have not heard you mention any of a UVB bulb,you will need one of them because this is what they use to digest their food.You realy do need all three for a healthy happy snake.I hope you make the rite choice for your lil buddy:)|`|8i90ov0Gaa	Some people say heat lamps are bad, others say heat pads are bad. I have used both and never had any problems. If used responsibly and the instructions are followed, you shouldn't have any problems either way. I don't use either. I use heat tape instead as well as keep my reptile rooms at controlled ambient temperatures higher than the rest of my home.    By the way, Lizard Lady, snakes do not need UVB lights to digest their food. If that were the case, then I'd have about 150 malnourished snakes on my hand right now.|`|X0Jkmx0Maa	depending on the temp. of heat pad i monitor the tanks air temp to make sure in the right area if not good enough try a heat rock check how hot it gets if its too hot for the snakes belly tape a cloth to it to absorb the heat layer if needed (tape on bottom of course)and also monitor the air temp. as well if it fails go with lamp and heat pad can be used to put under water bowl to get humidity and/or place to get belly warmth for digestion
gM7VuCM4aa	Kittens do have a faster heartbeat than adult cats. He may also have something wrong with him where he came from a not so nice home. He should have first kittens shots and be wormed and given a flea treatment at a vets.|`|LM7DWcdlaa	smaller animals have fast-paced heartbeats. He may also be sick. Take him to the vet, and keep him warm with (wet, not dry) food and fresh water. My kitten was sick when we got him and if we hadn't taken him to the vet he probably wouldn't be here by now. But don't worry, just make an appointment and watch him carefully. make sure he eats and stuff.   Also, keep him in ONE room and one room only. Kittens in a large environment get confused with trying to soak up all the information at once. Plus if you have another cat, hes probably frightened. Keep them separate.|`|ebJ02QZJaa	It's not unusual for kittens to not eat or drink anything when in a new place.  As long as he's playing, he's probably okay.  If all he's doing is sleeping, I'd be worried.  Any idea how old he is?  If he's real tiny, he may not know how to eat/drink yet.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Do put his food and water where he can get at it during the night.  That is, if he sleeps in your room tonight, be sure to show him where the food is should he want to get up during the night.  Do check his food before you go to bed to see how much is actually there, and so you will know if in the morning he has eaten any at night.  Same with his water.  (And litter box).    If he still has not eaten nor had water by morning, might want to discuss taking him to the vet to be checked.  His elevated heart rate could be due to poor hydration.|`|XB68v39haa	As a person who took in many animals. First, your animal has to see a Vet. to make sure it doesn't have that. Also you sais they weren't taken care of properly,.did have a copanion was he abuused?All these things come into play. You can call a Vet in the ER for animals. Some might feel that the cat is lonely.call the Vet and see. If he was an inside or outdoor cat, its bitterly cold as you know. You mentioned ferrel cat, a cat that is ferrel is wild and it takes a long time for the cat to become calm, and want to be with people. I have one, he is sweet now, but when he showed the signs that he was ferrel I could have died, but hes' a cutey now so don't worry .Talk with a Vet.  about his breathing. Calm down you are a special person to care soo much but the animal feels what you feel .LOL and take care and may God Bless you for careing for animals that no one wants.|`|n7bok7NRaa	Yes, kittens do have much faster heartbeats, and they do breathe a bit faster than a normal-sized cat, but if his breathing rate hasn't changed at all, when he's resting versus when he's playing or running away, there may be something wrong with him.    Is he interested, even for short periods of time, in a piece of string dragged near him? Does he respond to the smell of wet food, even to sniff it? Has he made any sounds at all?    You really, really should take him to a vet, especially if his leg has been broken (goodness knows, if he was raised by a bad owner, it may never have been set right).    If he's at least a pound in weight, he's probably old enough to handle food, but you can't force a cat to drink water. Just leave it with his food, and he'll investigate when he feels it's safe.    It would be very handy if your mom could answer some of these questions, too
yE2vM76naa	Here's an article about them    http://www.thekrib.com/Fish/Algae-Eaters...    Flying fox is just about half way down the page|`|J3IOlhd8aa	They are not the same fish. Flying foxes are known to be aggressive at times. Siamese Algae eaters are peaceful fish that should be kept in groups of 3+. I have 8 in a 125 gal tank and the eat constantly. Also they are the only readily available algae eater that will eat the Black Hair algae.    Great fish    stay away from the Flying fox|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Siamese algae eater lifespan is shorter than the flying fox.  Siamese algae eater, 4-6 years  Flying fox, 8-10 years|`|EKg97zZlaa	There isn't any difference, They are the same thing by look and personality.|`|tMlwcim8aa	First off, it's Chinese Algae Eater. Second, CAE's and Siamese Flying foxes are very similar in appearance, but are different in behavior. The CAE is obsessive in eating algae and constantly grazes on it and is peaceful. The SFF, doesn't have a great of drive to eat algae as the CAE, and is more placid, while CAE's are more active. Beware, though, the older and bigger a CAE gets the more aggresive it becomes. But don't worry that much about it though, that takes years to happen, and it may not even happen depending on the individual CAE. They are similar, but the CAE is cheaper, more common and more effective in eating algae. Also, the CAE changes it's color and pattern depending on the color of the substrate. The SFF has striped or bands, and the CAE usually has diamonds or square patterns, but changes as they adapt and get older to their environment.
846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	I think what they are trying to do is great.  The dog is not being mistreated.  That's like training dogs to help the blind, epileptics, deaf, or motility impaired.  It is a good thing, and will help thousands of children if successful, not to mention all the shelter dogs that could benefit from this.  PETA has nothing here it could balk at.  Therapy dogs are loved, well-treated, and happy.  What's to b**ch about?|`|uuudmeyyaa	I give it a couple of weeks.    Have you heard of the Sea Kitten thing PETA is pulling? Look it up if you don't know what I'm talking about... ridiculous...    I mean I treat my animals like my brothers/sisters/daughters/sons/best friends... I believe in animal rights... I work at a zoo and a pet store... but I also believe in common sense. I eat meat, my parents raise beef cattle... PETA would probably tell me I'm a horrible person who should be tortured and killed because I am apparently an animal hater.    Dear KEZ:    Our petstore doesn't sell puppies, we adopt dogs from humane societies. So don't be such an A$$.     And yes, I send cows to slaughter. As to many other millions of people in this country. So if you have never worked on or even visited a cattle ranch, you know nothing about cows and can not say what is wrong and right for them. Cows are dangerous animals that only exist (the ones we have bred) to be eaten. They live great lives on our ranch until we sell them to a feed lot, where they live a great life getting fat, and then are humanely (bolt to the brain, they don't feel a thing) slaughtered and eaten by humans who have canines, are naturally omnivorous, and require protein in their diet. Eating meat is just as natural as organic food. We never mistreat our cattle, they have all the green pasture and blue water holes they could want, we vaccinate them from bad diseases. These are animals that will kill you if you try to pet them. Not kidding, my mom got charged and had her collar bone broken, a neighbor got killed (crushed to death helping a cow in trouble have her baby), and my horse has even been charged by angry cows. They are NOT pets. They wouldn't have any time on this earth if we did not breed them, and we would not breed them if we didn't eat them.  So get a clue, city PETA kid.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	That is a really cool story.    And PETA is a joke.  Nobody takes them seriously.|`|aeYRUogNaa	I don't think they would bring attention to it since the dog isn't really being mistreated.  I do think it's a sweet story though.  Labs are notorious for wanting to please their "masters," so if the child's parents give it attention everything should be okay.|`|c88Z21chaa	as long as the dog is looked after why would they care?    and if there was a situation where torturing a dog somehow pleased a little boy, i bloody hope peta steps in and takes the dog away regardless of how it made the kid feel!!    but in this situation, the dog is being trained to help him, and probably gets all the attention he needs from parents and trainers.    and as for the person working in a pet store, do ur dogs come from puppy mills? and you send cows to slaughter? yeah, i can tell you are a true animal lover!!      I hope the training works out for them.  xo|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I don't see anything for them to complain about.The dog is well-cared for and the child is benefiting from the dog. If they complain,then they are idiots.
uttbqGB9aa	Try not too worry too much darling. Cats can feel your emotion so you should be strong for him.    As for comfort, just try to be with him and around him as much as you can, I know its sad, but he needs love right now & lots of it.    Talk to him and say cute nice things that you usually do. Let him know he is loved and you  will never leave him especially when he is in so much pain.    Im not sure when he can eat again, but keep checking in with the vet or the Tech by phone, give them updates, even if they are small and ask what you should do next.    They are supposed to give you this information.   Also ask what you can physically do to make him more comfy.    I hope he gets better soon sweetie! You're so strong for doing this, I couldn't imagine being so brave.    Good luck :)|`|uuudmeyyaa	Don't worry so much, cats get abscesses all the time.  Cats are very tough animals, and I'm sure your cat will tough this out and be just fine. I had an old old farm cat that had a tooth abscess, my mom popped it with a big needle, the cat screamed, pus and blood splattered everywhere, cat took off before we could clean it... she came back a couple days later just fine, lived for another good chunk of years before dying of old age.     PS blood is not bad, you really should work on getting over your phobia... especially if you want to continue to have pets and/or children. People who are afraid of blood come off as either weak or overdramatic hypochondriacs, or both, and you don't sound like either of those things to me.|`|NiFjl37haa	awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww poor kitty|`|aVGnsATJaa	well umm this is how me and my dad settle things with cats shoot em in the head with a 22..lol|`|HZpeiGn1aa	Just make it a comfortable bed with blankets and stuff so it's not cold.Listen to everything the vet says and it should be fine  Hope it gets better :)|`|zrUbBiFdaa	keep it warm and make sure he has a a comfy place to sleep. also if you happen to have any drop cloths (that people mostly use for painting) cats seem to LOVE, but i doubt you have them but its just an idea. make sure to visit him a lot, dont worry he'll be okay.|`|Zxtiewnyaa	i didn't get the chance to read your other questions about the cat but I'll try and tell ya what to do with this one. You mention that "we" are going to put him in the garage. If you can't take care of him because of the sight of his blood, then what is wrong with the others who is considered the "we" take care of him and clean his bandages he can't do it himself, that's were you and the others need to do. If by chance you and the others can't take care of the cat, then you need to let the Vet know before you go and pick up the cat and leave to go home. Maybe the Vet can provide shelter for him while he is being treated. It'll  cost a pretty penny. Or you can just try and put your differents aside and provide for this poor little helpless cat who needs your help for him to become healthly again. He would love you for that.|`|vJZYIGJBaa	don't worry.  cats have 9 lives.|`|aYL70sgvaa	I would never leave the poor sick animal in your garage! Just get a lot of towels and newspapers to keep him on and show him a lot of  love and care...I'm sure you care deeply about your cat so good luck!|`|jplrg1oJaa	Is the garage heated? Because leaving a sick cat (or a healthy one) for that matter in a cold garage is plain wrong.    If it's heated and he has enough food and water - and he gets some attention, he should be okay. If the bathroom isn't tiny though, it might be a better spot for him because really someone should be keeping an eye on him and the garage is likely further away from the bathroom. He's not a tiger, so it should be rather easy to keep him in the bathroom.     However, the best person to answer these questions is your vet. I highly recommend asking them when you go and pick your cat up.|`|SFEAMiUAaa	I feel sorry for you and your cat    just leave him alone and try not to bother him too much   that way he'll be confortable    I hope he/she gets well soon|`|AA11907945	I'm sorry for your troubles and can only offer this advice, be kind, patient and loving.    Right now I have a dog who is here sitting by my feet, my last cat was Esmerelda, I had her 17 years.  When she was old, sometimes the litter box was missed (not fun), but I tried to understand that while she was long in human years, she was near the end of her life.  Watching her watch me, helped me become a better person.    It's not easy to watch someone or something that we love have problems or sickness.  And while it is sometimes part of life, that doesn't make it any easier.    Keep her warm, perhaps get an inexpensive heating pad, put it on low, cover it with a old piece of cloth to protect it from accident, and let her lay on it to warmth.  My Esmerelda loved it.

f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	Socialize daily, this gets them accustomed to different noises and peoples actions, thus keeping them from moving during the showing, and keeping them from snipping at the judge.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	I take my dogs to any place that allow dogs. Pet stores, hardware stores, the farmers market, carnivals, 4th of July parties, parades, the park, the playground so they get used to noisy kids approaching them, friends house, etc. I do this since the day i get them. Only i don't let their feet touch the ground in public until they're 4 months old. I carry them everywhere until then.     My dogs are so well socialized that they can have an encounter with another dog that will bark, snarl, and lunge at my dogs aggressively. My dogs will simply turn around and walk in the opposite direction totally ignoring the other dog. Or my dog can be tethered next to another dog that barks at strangers and at other dogs. (my co-worker's Dachshund and Miniature Poodles are the barkers) Again my dogs just ignore the situation and will stand there next to the barking dog wagging their tail the whole time confused about why the other dogs are barking.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Every day.  I was really concerned about my pups lack of socialization when I brought her home.  I thought that she might never end up stable. (she was quite a bit older, almost six months old when I brought her home.  She was still living with her siblings)    My aussie is 10 1/2 months old now.  She has been socialized with:  puppies  old dogs  old and young people  elevators  stairs  crutches  wheelchairs  crates  sleeping in other people's houses  loud cars  barking dogs  car rides  banks  and so on...    Seriously, any exposure is good exposure. And on a daily basis, you can never socialize too much.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Most people bring them to public places- parks, dog shows, outside shopping malls.  New experiences everyday|`|VxKH7KHmaa	My puppies show or otherwise are always well socialized. They are taken along to many dog shows, agility, obedience, herding, flyball. They travel with me, meet lots of people and other dogs and are introduced to all kinds of new situations and noises.    It really just comes natural when your so heavily involved in dog related activities.|`|h7F4wA7eaa	Yes they get the pup used to dozens and dozens of people around they take them to parks, pet freindly resturants, well basically everywhere to get them used to it all.
wZKb8egaaa	Yup unless you live in california. It is illegal to buy or capture them here. But otherwise check the online breeders, try kingsnake.com and http://www.albinogartersnake.com/availab...  Please do plenty of research!!|`|vXyMNaeSaa	yes. buy one..|`|MX9M36B4aa	Ya buy one LOL:)
e9gXZsKxaa	yes|`|vSUfNm1Zaa	no,my mom cooks good food
nktIqi6raa	oh yes. dogs have to be walked and require more attention. cat's can be perfectly happy being feed and petted every now and then. they are pretty good at taking care of themselves. and no need to get up for a late night potty call, just have to clean the litterbox.     allthough cat's are not as easy to train and the ones i've had tend to be a nusience at night. such as my 4 y/o "kitten" thinks midnight is a perfect time to start running around the house and over beds and scrating on doors. my dog sleeps get's me up when she needs to go out and goes back to sleep|`|ijDgKdcxaa	As long as you don't mind cleaning a litter box every other day.  But they don't bark, you don't have to walk them and they each have their own personality.|`|tQN4lGKOaa	well, you have to clean their nasty litter box....they shed alot..they carry nasty critters into your home..they dig in their litter box and then jump on your tables and counter tops and spread diseases....you tell me?|`|jYL5HpC9aa	YES YES YES....I have 2 dogs and one cat....the cat is so much easier.  Hello....you don't have to walk a cat in the freezing cold, snow, rain, sleet, or hot summer days.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	I have about 30 cats and 5 dogs on a farm and I personally think cats are much easier.  -They don't eat nearly as much as dogs.  -They do not bark  -They do not usually run away|`|uSjy6vgnaa	Cats need lots of care to if they are to be looked after.  They need a litter box which needs to be emptied daily.  They need to be fed.  And so on.  The only reason some people might find them easier is they get a cat then they let it run loose.  All they really do is feed the cat.  Such cats don't live near as long.  Something like 3 years compared to 20 average.    I have a cat and a dog and they are about equal for ease of care.  They just have different needs.

qgeI6Chxaa	My parents had Dobermans when my brother, sister, and I were babies without any ill effects. I actually learned to walk by pulling myself up on the dog's back while he walked. It's important that you teach both the dog and your son to treat each other gently, but as long as the dog is well trained problems are unlikely. Dobermans are very protective of their families and know not to attack a member of their "pack."  Some people will always look at you like you're crazy when they find out you have a Dobie. The vast majority of these people have never met one.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Dobies are what you make of them as long as you're diligent with training it should be fine. I would suggest you get a puppy from a reputable breeder who lets you meet at least the mother and go to puppy class as well as teach your child the proper way to treat a dog.  Also with large dogs it is important you get them from a breeder who's sire and dam are over 2 years old with OFA certified good hips.  If they won't show you paper work find another breeder.  If they won't let you meet the momma find another breeder.|`|lmSffrNuaa	You may want to know more information about this breed, check this out.    http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/skv.html|`|4oO130L1aa	hi,    to know what type of dog will suit you, you can use this dog finder match up http://tinyurl.com/6gkcok  the goal here is to help you figure out what type of dog best suits your personality and lifestyle.

CJMhtM7maa	Your dog is not hunting your cat.You can use a spray bottle on your new dog when it starts to chase the cat.Put the spray on full stream and spray the dog ,a sharp no at the same time when he starts to chase.Your cat will get used to the dog and the dog to the cat. It takes time and consistency to train the dog.We have 4 rescued Pits in the house and our cat has trained them all,he will play and sleep with them.Good Luck and Thank you for rescuing the dog.|`|Ogh2zd7eaa	Please!!! Pitbulls nickname is nanny dog, because they are good with kids. Pitbulls are not hunting dogs and a Pitbull doesn't know he/she is a pitbull, she/he knows is a dog. Is everything about how the owner educates the dog. Specially if is mix with lab!!! Let the animals play. Let the cat show the dog who is in charge (the older animal should be) Don't pay more attention to the new animal, he/she needs to know cant get territorial|`|ehfe97Zcaa	I wouldn't worry about your dog eating your cat. He's more likely to just tear him apart but not eat any.     It's highly unlikely that you'll be able to introduce this dog as one of the "pack" seeing it's most likely to be the dominant one considering you have a cat and a chihuahua.     Get used to your cat running a lot and sleeping places where the dog can't go.|`|Kp5BOhNVaa	Teach the dog the "leave it" command, once she masters this have you and your bf and the cat and dog in a room, put the cat out of reach or on a bed or something. Everytime your dog goes near it, tell her "leave it!" if she compltes the command give her a treat, eventually she'll know how to behave.     Good luck.|`|F5gtYbDVaa	whatever you do, dont get rid of the kitty. c(:  hopefully the two will get use to each other but just wont be the best of friends.|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	I have a pit bull as well and two cats.  When I first rescued her, she thought the cats were a charge to scare, they would slap at her (they are not scared of dogs and only back down if they know they can't win)  and she would jump and bark at them.  In her case she thought they were like toys.  To help stop the behavior you have to make her submit to the cat.  The cat has to be above her in the chain, or she could see it as a weak link and go further than just trying to play, or she might just get too rough and accidentally hurt the cat.  But before you can accomplish that, you have to become alpha.  All humans should be alpha to her.  Because she is the larger animal in the house, she has to become pshycologically level with the other animals, so she knows to take direction from them at playtime.  Pits are especially playful and can go too far without knowing it.  Set her limits, stick with them, and create a bond with her by walking her every day.  She will listen you, but she also has to see you as alpha and respect you.      For more info on how to accomplish this, watch "Dog Whisperer: Ceasar Milan" on Discovery channel.  He also has books out you could look at.    My Pit is as playful as ever, but she now knows when to back off.  She still gets a charge out of scaring the cats now and them, but that's as far as she takes it.  She hops on her front feet towards them and gets them to arch and hiss, then lolls her tongue and looks smug about it.  Then she swaggers away like she's saying " Ha! Gotcha!".  It's too funny.  The cats do turn the tables now and then, and that's just as funny.
RFfTjnxzaa	Neutering will not stop humping. Neutering should never be used in place of training.    Whenever he humps the cats, just pull him off with a firm "No".|`|veDvtYhJaa	Neuter the dog.  Don't breed him.  He's way too aggressive to produce good pups.     Neutering does slow down the humping, but it doesn't stop it.-!-|`|u3rmd1Oyaa	He is showing the cat that he is the boss. They hump to show that they are in charge. What you can do is every time you see your dog doing it grab him, put him belly up and say NO. Say it as if you are mad. It should not sound as a favor. THe reason why you put him belly up is becuse it puts him in a submissive position. By making him submissive he will see that he is not top dog and he will stop. This might take a coulple of tries but you need to be consistant.    Hope this helps|`|uuudmeyyaa	Before you breed your dog...    Is your dog a pure bred AKC registered dog? Has it had professional dog training? Has it passed the canine good citizen test? Hat is been vet checked for hips/eyes/ and all other health checks, and passed with flying colors? Does the dog have good confirmation? Does the dog have an EXCELLENT personality? Has your dog competed in a dog show/agility/hunting trail/ something some other dog sport or event?     If you answered yes to ALL of those questions, congratulations, you are an outstanding breeder!    If you answered no to ANY of those questions, please for the love of dogs DON'T BREED. Your dog is a great pet but NOT breeding material if the answer to any of the above questions is no. There are so many great dogs euthanized in shelters EVERY DAY because people who answered no to the above checklist bred their dog. Some breed for money, some because they love their dog, some because they want puppies, some because they can't afford to neuter... but they are all wrong.     Did you know that neutering can increase the life span of your dog? It reduces the risk of many reproductive cancers and can add another 2-4 years to how much time your dog gets to spend alive! Neutering also obviously cuts down on the number of dogs killed in shelters because there are already too many dogs and not enough loving homes.    You might say that your dog's puppies will not end up in shelters, but you can't guarantee it. You don't know for certain that every person who takes one of your puppies is going to keep it forever. One very well might end up getting killed in a shelter some day. Even if you do find forever homes for all the puppies, what if none of the homes spays or neuters their puppies? Then all those puppies will grow up and have puppies. Then will there be homes for all those puppies? Will they all get fixed, or will they all have puppies too? Eventually a descendant of your dog very well could end up in a shelter, and it would all be traced back to being YOUR fault.     So please, if you answered no to any of those questions, save the breeding for the professionals and neuter your dog. It is the responsible thing to do.
w113ODiEaa	We moved our two cats from NJ to Arkansas a few years ago. (Also moved two rabbits at the same time in our two cars filled to the brim with stuff we didn't get into the rental truck my dad drove for us.) We put them each in their own cat carrier with a towel to absorb if they had to go.  We fed and gave them water when we stopped for the night and had a covered litter pan (they have a handle on top which is handy) that we put out for the them in the hotel room.  They really weren't interested in eating during the trip while we drove.  They meowed a lot whenever we first would load them in the car, but then would settle down.    When I was a kid we moved a cat and my mom got some tranquilizers from the vet and our cat did okay with that for the overnight drive.  She didn't go in a cat carrier - we had a van and she just rode in the back with us kids.  If you are driving on your own you probably need them in a carrier so they don't get under your feet or jump out when you stop.|`|GduRpnn0aa	Here is a great video on You Tube that talks specifically about traveling with pets: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2mykgjIR...

Do be careful when you take kitty out of car, as I have heard story after story of kitty getting off the leash and running away in unfamiliar area and in response to loud car, dog, etc......    Kitty will be fine with plastic shoe box of litter in the cage, as well as little food and water.  If you are going to take the cat out, stay in the car and take him out of the cage to play with him.  Can just pet him and brush him, then put him back in cage.  Can take him in cage just fine into motel room for the night adn let him out of cage for the night.  He might not be all that comfortable for a couple of days, but he will get over it, where if you lose him along the way, neither of you will get over it!!|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Depends?? you going by plane or car?|`|HZpeiGn1aa	I keep my cat in a cage ad put a little carpet down and give it food and water and take it out on a leesh ever so often|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	I would get a kitty crate and leads for them.

We had 2 of those big metal dog pens in the back of the truck, they had a small litter box, food & water dishes and a small bed. We stopped ever few hours to open up the back of the truck to give them fresh air and fresh food and water and scoop the box.  That was the only way we could figure to move them. It worked out great. They all got here safe and I didn't have to worry about anyone escaping.|`|3e5c9f32c95260657fe7f58b36af2eb8aa	Keep them in a carrier and ear plugs in your ears! Most cats aren't found of traveling. They'll most likely be howling and panting, cats do both when they get stressed out.    Take food and water and a litter box and stop every once in a while and give them access to everything - they probably will not eat/drink or go potty in a moving vehicle. They may not for short stops either.   If you stop at night they'll settle down after a few.    We moved from IN to PA with our cats and they hated it and cried all the way. It wasn't very pleasant for anyone. Several years later we moved from PA to AZ with one cat, at first she was crying but after a while on the road we let her sit on the whoever was not drivings lap and she was fine.    Hope this helps.

I stick to plecos now, to not worry about it. I think they are better cleaners and with a pleco, some corys, and shrimp and you have a stress-free awesome cleaning crew.

y7H1V39Jaa	It could be that they are unaware of the responsibility that you/they may or may not have if it should come to the horse getting injured.  If you could possibly get a copy of a lease, or some ideas on paper as to what a lease really is from someone who either has one leased or leases horses, it might help them to understand exactly what is what.  You might also be able to get a free lease, which means, you don't pay anything for the lease, but you are responsible for all of the upkeep of the horse...you could figure it both ways and see what comes out less expensive....and also find a copy of a lease that spells out who is responsible for an injury, should it be permanent, if the horse is on regular lease.  Maybe your parents just don't comprehend what all of this really means to you personally...maybe you could write a letter, take your time and pour your heart out and ask them to read it together when they really have time to read it seriously and discuss it, that you don't feel that you are being taken seriously and you would like to remedy that...I do hope that this gives you an idea that will work, as I grew up under the same circumstances.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	What will happen after five months, when your $500 is gone? $80 a month won't be enough.

Did it ever occur to you that mothers sometimes have things to do (including things they like to do just for themselves), and maybe they don't enjoy dropping everything to jump in the car and take you someplace, then come back and get you later?      3.  "I feel like there is a reason they don't want me to lease a horse, and their not telling me."  Maybe because you've decided you know all about everything and when they try to reason with you, you don't listen?  You dismiss the reasons they give you as excuses or things that don't matter, because you don't like what they're saying?    4.  Maybe because your parents are concerned about the legal obligations they become responsible if you lease the horse-- things like who is responsible for vet costs if the horse has an expensive emergency, or what might happen if the horse becomes unrideable or is killed as a result of something you did.  Sure, the chances of that are small.  But small isn't zero, and your parents may legitimately feel that they don't want to take that chance.    5.  Are your grades in school everything they should be?  And when they ask you to do chores, do you do them without being reminded, without whining or complaining or getting angry?  Parents are a lot more likely to do things for kids who show maturity and responsibility, as measured by schoolwork and helping out around the house.      You complain about your parents being unsympathetic about your love for horses.  How sympathetic are you about things that are important to them?  How much empathy do you show them about things in their lives that are important?  Have you considered them as people who have lives of their own and need time and energy and resources to do those things?  Sounds to me like you only think of them in relation to your wants and feelings.  What about their convenience, their needs, their problems?  **************************************...  Katelyn, your statement "My mom only works part-time and is home before I get home from school, so I know she has time." is incredibly egocentric and self-centered, no matter what you think.  What on earth gives you the right to decide this for your mother?  Has it ever occurred to you that parents like to have some time for themselves?  The bottom line is that your parents have no obligation whatsoever to take you to any extracurriculur activity.  You not only fail to acknowledge that, but you act as if your mom has nothing better in her life to do than leap at the chance to shuttle you where you want to go, when you want to go.  If my daughter took that kind of attitude, I'd ground her until she understood that.  You may find that an attitude that is less entitlement and resentment on your part, and more humility and gratitude, is more likely to get your parents to do favors for you.  Please get your mind around the fact that what you are asking for is indeed a favor, something extraordinary and inconvenient, not an entitlement.  Your mom does not exist just to do things for you.  If the attitude you have copped in this exchange is the one you display towards your parents, it doesn't surprise me at all that you can't persuade them to inconvenience themselves for you-- the more they do for you, the more you demand.  I'd balk at that too.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	What are the exact terms of the lease? Most leases - even the ones you pay for - leave you responsible for the cost of farrier and vet fees. What else do you have to pay for? Add that into your monthly cost. And estimate high, not low.    Find the actual mileage to the barn. Pretend your mom's car only get's 20mpg and gas costs $4 a gallon again. That means every mile costs $.20. So for you to go to the barn and back home again is .2 multiplied by whatever the round trip mileage is to get there multiplied by four times a week.     Be responsible and explain the money thing to your parents and offer to pay your mom. If it's only five minutes away ride a bike. If you think there is a reason, ask.     Your parents may not be supportive of you wanting to lease a horse because leasing inevitably leads into wanting to buy. You seem pretty headstrong and I'm sure the argument for you wanting to buy a horse that you fell in love with would be hard for them to take.    If they say no, accept it and take riding lessons. You will have your whole life to have horses in it with or without your parents' consent. When you're an adult.|`|XL62syrCaa	I understand you want a horse, BUT it may be something that you have to wait until you have a job. Horses cost more than just $80 a month to care for (even a lease, most of them require you to help care for feed, training, vet care etc..... Be patient.     Maybe go to your local barn and see about working off lessons? Or work out a deal where you do more chores in exchange for riding lessons.     Plus you have to realize that your mom has been at work during the day and is tired I highly doubt she wants to drive you there. She is NOT your chauffeur. Maybe find a barn that is closer were you can ride your bike (I dont know where you live so if thats not possible I understand)     You may have to face the fact that your parents may say no. If they do, respect them and continue working to save money. If they say no, don't throw a temper tantrum. Respect what they say and look for different ways that will make it EASY on them. Find a way to work off lessons before they have to take on the responsibility of leasing a horse (which they have to make sure you are doing for everything as THEY have to sign the contract as you are not 18). Make sure you are up to the work. Get some experience in by cleaning stalls, cleaning tack, and get your lessons in that way. There are always ways to finagle things if you work hard. Just know your parents don't have the passion for it so you can't expect them to jump out on a limb for it.    Again if they say no, just respect it :)|`|PEPWFGNGaa	I was going to mention about the fuel costs but Goodd already did that. As well as that there is the fact that it would be an added duty for your mother - something that would get in the way of anything else that she has to do or wants to do be that shopping or vising folks in hospital or whatever, the commitment required from her could cause more hassle ( trust me - I am a parent with a car, kids and horses so I can understand the problem with that) As Goodd said - if it's not far then you could offer to ride a bike.  The other reason that comes to my mind is your age - because if you are below a certain age ( and I don't actually know what age) then you can't personally enter into a contract - your parents would have to do that which would then bind them to the terms instead of you. In which case if something went wrong and you suddenly couldn't pay then they would be legally obliged to. Also if there was an accident or whatever then they would be the ones to be held legally responsible.  No idea if this is relevant as I don't know the legal age and I don't know your age either - I just thought it was worth pointing out.|`|pR4JVtSJaa	As someone else said, that $500 in the bank won't "flesh out" the payment you need to make for very long.  Especially if you ever buy anything but the lease payment.  A new whip? Helmet? Boots? Treats?  Go to a movie?  It all adds up so fast....  And you'll want to take lessons every once in a while, because if you don't your body "forgets" and errors start to creep in.  That's why even the pros take lessons.  And your parents are very wise to not let you wipe out your savings.    I have to agree, if less offensively, with the person who said that it's very generous of you to offer your mom's time to drive.  Maybe it is just an excuse, I don't know. But maybe to her it's just one more task on her list of things to do.  And what if you're not ready at the usual time? Will she have to sit and wait for you, or drop what she's doing to pick you up when you call?  I won't say you're selfish, but I do ask that you look at it from her point of view.  Or just ask why she objects to the drive.  Could you carpool?  Or walk, or ride a bike?    Usually it helps if you present a solid plan, written out. It shows how serious you are, and how much thought you've put into it.  The name of someone who promised you could have a job worth $20 a month or more - maybe working for a boarder at the barn? Your route to bike to the barn and back. That sort of thing.    Ask if your parents would be willing to come to the barn and talk to the manager themselves.  They can address objections to her that they may not be willing to talk about with you.  Maybe they need to be more familiar with this place you want to spend all your time.    Be patient, be polite, but be persistent!
n7bok7NRaa	You should avoid pulling on your cat's limbs, just because you're much stronger than they are.    I would ask why it's important that you get your cat out of his favorite tight area. Many cats love to squeeze into tiny places and hide or nap. If he's not going to get hurt (that is, if he's not under something that might crush him) why not just leave him there?    I understand there might be an emergency, in which case, if you really need to get him out, use a broomstick. You don't have to hit him or poke him, just lightly press the flat of the stick across his back end, and he'll scoot away from it.    Grabbing a cat by the scruff of the neck is fine if you're ABSOLUTELY going to support the rest of their weight with something else. Most adult cats (especially overweight and elderly ones) are too heavy to be carried (or dragged) by their scruff alone. They may be hurt by this act - so you should always be careful, if you're going to lift them this way.    Use common sense. If you wouldn't want a giant doing it to you, your cat probably doesn't want you doing it to him.|`|uuudmeyyaa	I wouldn't do that. Cat arms can be fragile and you can easily hurt your cat without meaning to or even thinking you could.     If you want to get the cat out without coaxing with treats or toys, I would grab for the scruff of the neck. This won't hurt the cat (even if the make some noise it doesn't hurt) and will give you a good enough grip to pull the cat out.|`|JEGKaKzcaa	preferably not, if you can help it. Karen's suggestion about grabbing the scruff of the neck was a good idea. Otherwise if it's playful enough, i'll just get my kitty out with toy or string. My non-playful cat will come out for food or a lazer pointer :D i can get it to go anywhere with that. just be careful with their eyes, if you do use one. It's great for exercise and entertainment. You can get them to run up and down stairs with just a flick of the hand.|`|XKtjEiEraa	It's better than him staying under the bed and starving to death. But when I need to get my cat out from under my bed, I'll hold her by the scruff of her neck. It's a good grip, you aren't just pulling on something, and it's not painful.|`|c88Z21chaa	not okay! cats skeletons are tiny, their bones and muscles are very fragile. Grab the scruff of the neck and drag the cat with that, as long as you arent pinching and have the right place, you wont hurt the cat.  xoox
MX9M36B4aa	If she ate one then i would not worry about this yet,but i would keep a close eye on her and make sure she is voiding between feedings and if this continues and her appetite doesnt pick back up next feeding then i would get her to a vet.And make sure you are useing the UVB bulb and vitamins|`|44gTtORXaa	nothing...But  I have a three step trick to getting almost any Ball to eat:  1) Feed it just after lights out, in the wild they hunt between dusk and dawn.  2) Cover all sides of the tank with a dark bed sheet or blanket and leave it alone for at least one hour with the food close to its head (and for goodness sake, make sure the mouse/rat/gerbil is dead before you do this, you don't want to come back to find a half eaten snake in an hour!) Make sure not to touch its face either, this often causes them to refuse a meal.  3) This is best tip I can give you; Scent the feeder mouse/rat with a gerbil. They love gerbils. You can do this one of two ways, obtain some used bedding from a gerbil cage and let the rat run around in it for a while (I'd say at least 30 minutes so that it absorbs the scent of the gerbil), or buy a gerbil and put it together with the mouse/rat for a while.  You can feed the gerbil to the snake too, and it will love you for it, but I wouldn't make a habit of that since they can be expensive (12-15 bucks a pop!).    Also make sure it is has at least one (preferably two) hiding place, Proper lighting intervals, roughly twelve hours on and off, and proper temperatures in the cage (85-90F). If any of these criteria are not met, the snake will be stressed, and it will not feed.    If that still doesn't work, it may just be refusing meals currently (which they do!), just keep offering and eventually it will eat.  Don't worry about it unless the snake begins to look unhealthy (emaciated or mouth hanging open). When that happens, take it to a vet.|`|ce2b2dc56d9aefc8a00f9183d55c6fbfaa	that means she is full.  you only need to feed your snake one appropriate sized mouse every 5 days.  and during the winter months many snakes go on a month or so fast during which they wont eat at all.   email me if you need anymore help!!
TkJn9gO0aa	Amanda : where in TN are you located? We have just started a herp society here in TN......The East TN Herp Society........but we welcome everybody to join.

He is 16 hands, a very gentle giant, registered paint.  He is almost 5 years old.  He will mainly be used for trail riding.  His name is Harley.    Also have a 10 year old sorrel paint mare named Keeper.  She is sorrel w/ a white blaze, 2 small socks, and a belly spot on both the left and the right side.  She is about 15.2-15.3 hands tall.  Unfortunately, we have to sell her because we have too many horses :(.  She is also a registered paint and is used for trail riding and cattle.    I have a 26 year old chestnut quarter horse gelding named TJ.  He is also registered.  He has a white blaze and 2 hind socks that are almost unnoticeable.  He used to be a lesson horse and was used as a show horse in english and western pleasure, but is now retired.  We use him for trail riding sometimes, but otherwise just hangs out in the pasture.  He, like Keeper, is also for sale to a good home.    Sandy, my 24 year old bay missouri fox trotter has a white star and 4 white socks.  She is my old trail horse and is used mainly for all of the beginners.  I have shown her in walk and trot and have always placed in the top 3.  She is about 15 hands, not registered.    I also have a 25 year old mule named Twitch.  Ugliest mule you will ever see.  His mother was an appaloosa and he is a blueish gray color with these ugly black and brown spots.  We use him for trail riding and he is just like Sandy, bombproof.  He is about 14.3 hands.    Last but not least we have a little paint pony named Ben.  He is black and white and was foundered when we bought him but is now totally sound.  He is used for the little kids in trailriding or just for pony rides.  He is about 13 hands and is 15 years old.|`|KVkkPqumaa	Me! I have had my horse for 6 weeks now and I can't imagine what I did without her!
