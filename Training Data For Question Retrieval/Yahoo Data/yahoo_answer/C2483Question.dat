20090227144248AA0g9Yi	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Would this monologue work for my theme park audition (re-posted)?	I asked this once, but only got one answer, so I'm going again.   I'm auditioning for a summer show at a theme park. They're looking for actors, singers, and dancers. Actors do a one-minute monologue and then cold readings, singers do two contrasting pieces a cappella, and dancers do a combination they teach you. For the acting portion, I'm considering this piece from Anton In Show Business, because I feel like it requires a good sense of comedy and timing to pull it off:      KATE: Actors Express. Get it? Express? We are a serious theatre. We are unique. What is our artistic policy? Well, I can state that policy clearly. We live these ideas. At Actors Express, we call them the Seven Virtues. Number one, we do plays that (she makes a complex gesture). Two: our style is surgically defined as (a series of sounds). And only that. Fourthly, multi-cultural new works from the classical repertoire that say to the audience (an even more complex gesture). So that, in summation, or seventh, we can say (stares at cieling), and we say that with no fear of being misunderstood. Oh, I know this policy makes us controversial. We offend, we pique, we challenge while at the same time bringing together, healing, and and making our community one. In a nutshell. This unique mission makes us essential to San Antonio not because I have the best education money can buy, but because...hear this...contemporary relevance. Does anyone find what I said moving?      It isn't your traditional audition piece, but then, the theme park doesn't do your traditional shows. (I've read the whole play, and while I'm fudging the age of the character a bit, her age doesn't come into play in the actual text, and she doesn't have any life experience I'm wholly unable to relate to.) I'm an actor/singer, but not a dancer, so I thought it would be in my interest to be able to move a bit. (From what I understand, everyone cold reads, so I'll be able to show further range there.)       Thoughts?

Para levantar los bloques, lo más probable es que se utilizara un sistema de rampas y que las piedras se arrastraran por ellas por medio de patines. Es posible también que se emplearan andamios para colocar el revestimiento calizo. De este revestimiento sólo queda constancia en la parte alta de la pirámide de Kefrén. Se cree que el pulido del revestimiento se hizo desde el vértice hasta la base. Lo que sí parece seguro es que en las construcciones de estas pirámides no se emplearon herramientas de hierro, motores ni ruedas.

20090227144322AArXTEb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Are these books too similar?	I saw this book in my school called Dead Until Dark, and on the cover, it said something like "she knew having a vampire as a boyfriend was a bad idea". I froze because I love Twilight and it sounded similar. So I looked it up,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Until_...  and I was struck by how many similarities there are. I'll list some.   1. Well obviously, there are vampires and she's dating one   2. Someone can read minds but can't read to one of their love interest. In this book, the girl can read minds.   3. People are being killed and its in sort of a correlation to her.   4. She has a friend that can shape-shift...and he chooses, of course, a dog.      I thought it was weird that Dead Until Dark came out before Twilight, so maybe Stephenie Meyer got some ideas from it. I think its too close to be coincidental.

Dirge Without Music      by Edna St. Vincent Millay          I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.       So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:       Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely.       Crowned with lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.       Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.       Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.       A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,       A formula, a phrase remains, - but the best is lost.       Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave       Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;       Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.       I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.       Song      by Christina Rossetti          When I am dead, my dearest,       Sing no sad songs for me;       Plant thou no roses at my head,       Nor shady cypress tree:       Be the green grass above me       With showers and dewdrops wet;       And if thou wilt, remember,       And if thou wilt, forget.       I shall not see the shadows,       I shall not feel the rain;       I shall not hear the nightingale       Sing on, as if in pain:       And dreaming through the twilight       That doth not rise nor set,       Haply I may remember,       And haply may forget.      QUESTION: How are the poems alike, and how do they differ?

20090227145138AA0C78U	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem worthy of a book?	How old, based on this poem, would you guess I am?   If you like this, go to www.writerscafe.org and look up Kameron Armitage.  It's a great website!         It's painful to see.      Your love for him growing stronger.      None given to me.      Can't grasp this much longer.             Not me.      It's him.      This hurt will never drift.      Can't get.      What I thrive.      Love is not a gift.             I am seeing a never ending Mirage.      As I continue to chase you, with no chance of success.      The only thing that love attracts is distress.             Yet I welcome it.      As if it is wanted.      And now I cannot forget.      And I am still being haunted.             Please, set me free.      Rejecting.      Accepting.      That's all that I need.             But one thing I won't do.      Is leave without trying.      I need to either be with you.      Or get closer to dying.             Although it may hurt, I will thank you deeply.      Because all that I want, is for you to see.      The real me.      Who truly.      Loves thee.      With one last plea.      Please set me free.

20090227145419AA4Fhd5	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is morally praiseworthy about socially responsible investing?	I need some help understanding why some people argue that one should invest in socially responsible companies. After a stock gets issued, it's traded in a secondary market, so how would my buying or not buying have any impact on the underlying company? Note here that I am talking about those mutual funds that try to support morally conscious businesses, which is a distinct activity from shareholder activism.       On the other side of the coin, what difference does it make if one invests in a shady business, such as a cigarette manufacturer or oil company? If I am a morally responsible person, shouldn't I be better able to use the profits from investing in say, Halliburton over the Bush years than someone with less scruples? But for some reason I have this intuition that it is wrong to invest in companies that harm the environment and/or economy. I just can't articulate why.

20090309093248AAAxaXy	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your philosophy for life?	One of my many thoughts on life is that you avoid hurting any living being emotionally, physically, or mentally. When I say being, I mean anything that breaths. So, yes this includes animals who live in the wild and in your house.       I honestly believe ALL humans know when they are hurting someone in some way. I think we all have the feeling of sensing other people's emotions and we know when we are causing stress and pain.       So, with that said, I think that believing in a higher power is mute. I think your overall goal is to treat all things that are HERE and on this planet with respect. Give when you have it and make sure that your days are filled with people who are glad you are here, not people who hate you for terrible things you've done to them...      Any thoughts on your own philosophy?

At 5 years old,Trevor Crow witnesses the murder of his father on the hands of a man named Morphew and his dragon.      Trevor is sent to an orphanage.Everynight he kisses his father's picture that's set inside a heart shaped locket.One day while being bullied,the locket glimmers with red light,and the bullies are set on fire.      Next day after being accused of burning his friends intentionally,Trevor decides to escape the orphanage.On his way throught the dark alleys of london,Trevor is abducted.Later on at the abductor's mansion,victor knows that he's a man named Fionuir and he's his father's friend,and faithful mentor.      Fionuir shows Trevor a griffin named Fyrfax.He tells him that Trevor's father had participated in international races riding this grifiin,fyrfax.And now it's his turn to ride this griffin and participate in other magical creatures' races.      Trevor trains to drive this griffin,and he participates in many illegal magical creatures' races ,winning reputation in the magiacl creatures' racing world.      But Trevor finds out that morphew the man who murdered his father is trying to gain control over Fyrfax because his dragon has lost one of his wings,and since then he has been trying to gain control over fyrfax,the swiftest creature in the racing world.      Also Trevor finds out that his father's lockey has always been a connector between Trevor and fyrfax.As long as this locket is undestroyed,no one can drive Fyrfax except Trevor.So morphew will try to destroy the locket to gain control over fyrfax and rejoin the racing arena.      I'm feeling very down.Should i abandon the whole stroy if it has some similarities with eragon?

20090309093525AAQdL2h	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Which book is this? Help please!?	I read it a really long time ago ..      It's about this girl who's parents were the rulers of a country. Her uncle (I think) led a revolt and murdered her parents. She was then given a potion to make her infertile, so that her cousin sister (the daughter of the evil uncle) would become the ruler. As a child/teen, she meets this guy in the woods; he is some sort of a scientist, I think. He ends up doing something with steam to heat up the palace?      Some other random details I remember:   - She always wears black.    - The word cat/kat is somehow significant; I think it was what 'Queen' was called in that land    - She does end up getting pregnant despite the potion   - There is some cleansing ritual within the book   - At one point, they are in the square, and some man is being beheaded. The queen has to touch her lips to the chalise filled with blood. It's part of the custom or something ...      So there we go! I'd love to re-read the book, but can't remember its title or author for the life of me! It was something I randomly picked up in the library :)      Thanks!!

20090309103221AAVAw3U	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	To Kill a Mockingbird?	Atticus says that courage is “when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what” (112). Compare Atticus’s shooting of the rabid dog to Mrs. Dubose’s struggle with morphine addiction; in what ways do the two situations fit or not fit Atticus’s definition of courage? Additionally, how do Scout and Jem’s understanding of courage change in the course of Chapters 10 through 11?

20090309100427AAUGyYH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story I'm writing?	The clipping is of a romance part of the story. Its taken somewhat out of context, so I'm looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. The "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name or develop. Any constructive crit is appreciated. Also, the word family here means a strong group of friends.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "I missed you- alot. For some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. Heh. I often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   I found myself looking down. I was embarrassed by what I said. I sounded like such a loser and so desperate. I was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "I did think of you. I thought I was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...Ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   I went blank. All i could do now was stare through her in amazement. I found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "Thank you", she said.   "For what?"   "For missing me."   I let out a breath of a laugh."Why wouldn't i miss you?"   "Why would you?"   "I love you", As i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   I knew I had to say something. I couldn't help what I just said. I had to change this moment. I had to make something out of this. I had to recover from this mistake.   "I hope that didn't come out too cheesy. I spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "Hey..stop talking". She cut me off. I was ready for a verbal lashing. I felt terrible and sick. After all she went through, I should be aware of her feelings. It was so obvious. What was I thinking. Was i thinking? These Thoughts raced through my head so fast that I COULDN'T think. I attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "I love you too."   I felt like i went dead.

In "The Mayor Of Casterbridge" and "Tess Of The d'Urbervilles", it is noticeable that Hardy uses the past in a negative and cruel manner, resulting in his characters having no choice but to cover up their histories and eventually suffer for their past indiscretions.

At the conclusion of Frankenstein, Robert Walton has an encounter with the monster, who arrives after Victor Frankenstein has died. Perhaps surprisingly, the monster mourns his creator and expresses remorse over the fate that Victor suffered. The monster pledges to destroy himself and then departs, disappearing as he goes further north. How does the monster’s behavior and attitude in this part of the novel affect the way readers view him?    Is he sympathetic? Is he more hateful because it is only after Victor has died that he relents?    How does the change in the monster fit with the theme of duality in the novel?

Myself during a REM cycle, and woken up at the end explaining the dream (with pictures)      It would be split screen, filmed in 'night mode'   THe left would be me sleeping. The right would be me reading the dream out of my dream journal (I know that the dream will correspond with the REM because I will have my cousin wake me up after I start to go into a NREM cycle.       How does that sound?      It isn't supposed to be a 'movie theater' film, or in a Sundance film festival. It is supposed to shot how dreams are in the eyes of the beholder. There shall be no plot. It is Un Chien Andalou meets Andy Warhol's Bl0w J0b      You almost always remember a dream you are awoken from, so there is no problem there.      As for the synchronization, it will not be perfect. But it is kind of the meaning, that it is all in my head and you can not make the physical and mental link if you are on the outside looking in.
20090309151839AApVAqa	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	My Shakespearean style poem..  wadda you guys think? xx  thanks a lot! xx?	Jane, oh Jane it pains me to see   Of the pale love that he doth give to thee.   His love as the serpent who stalks in the grass.   His deception can fool you my love, through me it cannot pass.      Dear Jane, he cannot appreciate your weary eyes.   Nor can he see behind the sapphire that is so wise.   My darling Jane, the gem is impaired.   He speaks with a forked tongue, you hath a beauty so rare.       My sweet Jane, such roses I see in your cheeks.   Yet he looks with such arrogance, deceives when he speaks.   As to paint those roses there with his hand.   He claims they grew there, lovely Jane, he does not understand.      Beautiful Jane, your hair waves with the ocean‘s hands.   Your locks mimic the golden sun above, he sees only sand.   My darling, I spy a world in his grain of sand.   You hath no simplicity, but he does not understand.      Fair maiden thy smile hath more strength than thy voice‘s sweet melody.   In thy smile I vision heavens mighty glow, in his evil I see thy enemy.   My love, you are blind to see this knave’s shallowness of sight.   For he sees shallows as depths, water as a mirror, he bends from false height.      His is the cosmic fool, and he doth fool you with his revelry.   He wishes to fall into the water and hold his own face, just as he seeks to fool you with his devilry.   I think of thee on every Eve, of every dawn.    And although it may seem vainglory to strive as the wind cuts the air, it is with god speed I race to warn.       For thy love is blind, and drawn in to temptation by his stories.   His love is but a mask, painted to mimic thy perfect face of love and glory.   I fear for thy heart’s innocence, I care not for his; carved from granite.   And my sweet Jane I love thee, with the letters from every love song, how I long to have sang it.

20090309141705AA6F1sc	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Camera with quality as good as DSLR/SLR Cameras?	- Shutter speeds, At least 10 seconds, and at least 1/2000   - ISO, at least low as 100, at least high as 3200   - Good video quality w/audio (don't know where to start on this).   - Price range: No more than $350.         I'm looking for a camera where I can shoot great pictures, not trying to go all with the 'professional' look and quality, but great enough that to 'regular' people the photos seem good as if it was taken with DSLR/SLR cameras. Also I'm probably going to be playing with shutter speeds. As for video, I'm probably going to do music videos (again I don't want it to be all professional) I just want something to shoot around and do production with that will look great with quality. With the audio, I know some of you might mention blue tooth/ wireless microphone for music videos, but I'm going to edit 100% of the audio out and replacing it with the audio music anyways so I don't need a camera compatible of having that feature. But I'd still like a camera with a microphone and audio feature just so I can shoot at parties or when I'm bored doing video blogs and such.      I'm not looking to go all greatly expensive. Don't show me camera's that or more than what's my expecting price range. I pushed it from 250 - 350 already. I don't need for anyone to say " for only 100 or 150 more you can get this" Because If I'm going to spend anywhere near $500 I mine as well just get an expensive DSLR, and I'm not looking to do that, I'm not a professional photographer, but I do know some what about photography knowledge which I picked up from a class I took in high school (which wasn't that many years ago).

I have been trying to work out if an animal would be catagorised as a being-in-itself or a being-for-itself. This is just to flesh my notes and make things clearer in my mind. Thanks.

20090309121707AAb63Vt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does my intro match this story about a dream i had?	INTRO      The introduction has an explosive action scene. Two teams with 8 on each. The war occurs until one team is defeated forever. There is one team who has held there stance undefeated for the longest time in history. They were just killed, when the winning team is heading back to town 2 men who lead the fight in the very beginning have now vanished without a trace, the others dont understand why. As they are trying to put the pieces together they hear a loud crashing sound. Surprisingly there chances to defend themselves now are at its worst, their is only one way to survive and that was with who vanished or was left behind for one purpose only.      This second part is a shorter sentence.      The undefeated enemies were defeated, has now come back to life as spirits they restart one final war all over again seeking revenge till death strikes the first wars winning team with action filled dilemma       Chapter One      When heading back home two are un - accounted for one is our king the other his brother everyone stops talking, we must go back. His servant is called within the crowd, werent you standing right by them, where are they, well our king and his brother realized there most treasured swords were stabbed criss crossed in another mans chest, he told me quietly that they are going to go collect after it, he told me not to say a word and that they will not return until the next day. After killing the one team who needed to become beaten we never knew what we would face soon after the others were deceased. we waited in darkness we stared out at wind blowing at our faces not seeing anything except the night sky of stars we waite more patiently until one calls out to everyone run dont look back they are coming fast.      His word was spoken he will be fine lets run for our lives. As the ground is being pounded with foot marks Balls of fire are launched soaring with flares and crashing down upon us striking the ground feet behind us with the master and his brother behind the crashing balls of fire. no running back now no weapons that puncture a wound your left for dead if your not already in zoom from the enemies sight. did we miss something nothing they thought was possible what appears are flesh eating spirits starving to be human again. With the other men left ahead there repetitive seconds blaring to the ground not knowing what is happening. We hear the brother crying help then run run away dont look back. out of the darkness dust covering our tops its so hard to see now, something is coming at us fast run hide where anywhere. 2 and 3 running fast without anything strapped to there bodies. We are weaponless running for our lives. One looks back then trips to the floor running on his hands and feet backwards. face to face with evil he realizes we have just begun there will be no end until we are defeated and all ancestors are defeated. The spirit rips through this mans mouth as he screams so loud then silence his eyes roll back,

I love all of the characters especially Ron because he is always the unlucky one and it is funny. Twilight i like it but its mainly just about romance and vampires.

I eventually, in the very far future, want to buy nicer lens, but can't really afford it right now.  Do they work very differently?  I am not very knowledgeable on this subject.  As a side note does anyone know how good  the EF-S 18-55IS lens is?  Should I buy the XSi as a kit or buy a separate/better  lens?

20090309120449AAMJuoZ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	If human nature has shown?	us that, we are essentially animals who , although we may fight against our natural instincts, ultimately succumb to them-- and that in every society this trait has always caused there to be various classes, competing for dominance, why do we have such a hard time accepting that a utopian society isn't feasible. For every country that has gained a certain level of power, it has had to screw someone else, or several someone Else's to gain that power: In the U.S.--it's Blacks, and Native Americans; in Canada it was the first nations, SA....we all know. So why is it that people have a hard time understanding inequalities within society, and often attribute them to the alleged groups shortcomings rather than anything else   10 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.

20090309120055AAMGxeL	Arts & Humanities;History	Question for people knowledgeable about the history of Irish-Americans.?	I was reading a novel published in 1927 called Harangue by Garet Garrett and was baffled by the following passage: "His manner, although more offensive than before, had changed. For as they looked at each other a Celtic sign appeared between them. Extremely unlike as types, and by reason of that unlikeness mortally antagonistic, still both were Irish and therefore related in a manner too subtle for non-Celtic understanding. Further offence, if any, would be personal and so intended."      My question is what is the "Celtic sign" in the passage? Why is it significant? I am simply not familier with the culture of  Irish-Americans of that period.      Thanks
