Jpf8VbnVaa	yes, lol don't know what else to say, but yes you can, i do it with one of mine|`|AA11801029	Yes, however it depends on the game and the installation of it, which can either make it easy to do or a bit difficult.  A good example is the microsoft game set that had things like tetris, solitare, pipe dreams, and such included, this game set is not dependant on a drive letter just that is has the correct install information in the registry which is put there when you install it.<br>    However, there are games and or programs that require to be placed in one spot and one spot only and with an external drive the drive letter can change making the program not work, for example, if the program or game is installed ojnto your external drive when it is the only drive plugged in, windows will assign it either D: or E: as a drive letter, however if your using another drive, a thumb drive, or a memory card, then you plug your external drive into your computer, windows will assign it a letter that is not being used by the other things you have plugged in so the drive may have the drive letter of F: threw Z: depending. So if the program or game is drive letter dependant your game or program will not work in this manner.<br>      Now there are also those programs or games that will check to see if you have the original CD in the drive in order to run. This type of program or game would require you to install a virtual cd drive on your computer where you can make a virtual copy of the cd so the game or program will work without the original cd in the drive, this is a bit more difficult because it would require you to know a little more about computers, and have an understanding of drive letters and what ISO image files are.<br>     I had help several years ago with this type of setup so to "pay it forward" you can email me and I can send you what you will need to do this but I would need to know the program or game you are wanting to run from an external drive so I can give you the correct directions on how to configure the virtual drive software and instructions on making the ISO file you will need to get thing to work right. I would also need to know the operating system your using and brand of computer your using it on.<br>      However one last thing, if you are thinking of loading a game or program than is for a x-box or playstation on to your computer to be able to play it, this is a lot more difficult and requires a lot more work to do, and unless your extremely good on computers I would not say you should not even attempt it.<br>      If you would like my help with getting this to work for you, gather up the information I requested and I will walk you threw the steps to get the game or program istalled on your external drive.  By the way, in many cases if you have a thumb drive with enough space on it, you could even load the game or program onto it, instead of a external hard drive.

1NWjta2jaa	Actually, you are not "sending" a file to a phone, you are synchronizing your laptop and the phone. You can synchronize emails, notes, address book, folders, files. It can be done by connecting the two devices by a cable or via Bluetooth. Bluetooth connection doesn't always work right and sometimes it doesn't work at all, whatever you do, BUT if the synchronization works the way it is supposed to work, no matter which connection you use, then a file in that exchange folder should "appear" in the folder by the same name in your phone. In short, you don't SEND it to the phone. It goes there by itself during synchronization. In the settings of synchronization you MUST indicate (mark) what is to be synchronized. Make sure Exchange Folder (and whatever else you want) is marked to be synchronized. When you put anything in that folder, it's not the end of procedure. Now you need to synchronize the devices. This is when things are moved.

It could be a program to load items from specific locations.  <br>  <br>  Best to do is only run attachments from people you trust and know.  Install a firewall as well as anti-virus.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, there isn't much you can do because they either have physical access to your computer or they are getting it from your computer to the ISP.<br>  <br>  If it is wireless you really should encrypt the router and signals.<br>  <br>  Running a program called hijack this and malware bytes will also help you track any malicious programs on your compute.r

This way you just need to break out of the loop at the first prime factor. Since your using nested loops, the basic idea should be for the outer loop to go down until it finds a factor of number. Once it finds that number, the inner loop should check if that number is prime (if it has no factors).<br>  <br>  so your code would look something like:<br>  public class Primefactor{<br>  public static void main(String[] args){<br>  <br>  long number = 600851475143L;<br>  long primeFactor = 0;<br>  <br>  for (long i = answer/2; i > 1; i--) {<br>  // Find factors of number<br>  if(number % i == 0){<br>  long k;<br>  // Check if this factor is prime<br>  for(k = i/2; k > 1; k--){<br>  if( i % k == 0 ){<br>  break;<br>  }<br>  }<br>  if(k == 1) {<br>  primeFactor = i;<br>  break;<br>  }<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  System.out.print("The largest prime factor of " + number + " is: " + primeFactor);<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  That looks like it should work.

So a would end up as 0.<br>  There are two ways to get around this.<br>  1. change the line to<br>  a=(r*100) /p;<br>  This way r is multiplied by 100 before it is divided by p.<br>  2. declare r and p as floats, so r/p will be a floating point division. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SNZ88BfKaa	In addition to what others have said, your logic for checking grades is wrong.<br>  <br>  The expression 79 < a > 90 is the same as a > 90, since it's asking for a greater than 79 and 90. What you want is 79 < a < 90, which means that a is between 79 and 90. Now, in your code, you'd want this: <br>  <br>  (79 < a && a < 90)<br>  <br>  Or, preferably, this:<br>  <br>  80 <= a && a <= 89)|`|0wUwKbHsaa	Well the first thing that stands out to me is how you are constructing the IF.  This isn't math.  To ask the computer if a number is between to others, you need to say:<br>  <br>  Is this number greater than x AND less than Y.  To do that you need to use a logical AND.<br>  <br>  For example, use the following instead of what you have.<br>  <br>  if(a>79 && a<90)<br>  <br>  Also this code is a bit hard to read as is.  Instead of just using the greater than and less than symbols, you might want to throw in some greater than or equal to operators.  It is just weird to go down a nested if and see the number increment (89 -> 90, 79 -> 80, etc).  Too much thinking needs to be involved when someone else reads the code.

Contact me if you have any other question.|`|oedys7Mqaa	Well, it all depends on the program used for it. It is not platform-dependant, it all depends on what program you use. <br>  <br>  Mac comes with iTunes, Windows comes with Windows Media player, so let's pretend you use those 2 programs. To use the same file on both platforms, Windows and Mac OS X, you would have to use a file format that is common on both programs, such as .mp3 and .wma for audio, and .avi and .wav for video. There are more formats you can use, but these are the most common ones. AAC files are not supported on WMA, so don't have iTunes convert them if you want to maintain compatibility.<br>  <br>  If you wish, you can Google both those programs, and many others, to figure out what file formats they support.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|YHc5aWAYaa	With perian (<a href="http://www.perian.org/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.perian.org/)</a> Macs can read all of the windows media formats, like mp3, avi, wav, wmv, mp3 all that stuff.|`|AUfiJaNFaa	Mac can read all of them, just get "flip for mac"  to read the .wmv files<br>  <br>  want free stuff?  go here:  <a href="http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=1027583" rel="nofollow">http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=10...</a>

lcyV3WHAaa	Windows ME is the worst OS. Vista gets a lot of flak, but it's still in a lengthy transition phase and it was handled badly. It's also resource intensive, but it is stable, comparable to XP, if a little slow and annoying. Windows ME should never have been released. <br>  <br>  As for manufacturers, any big name is going to get some baggage.<br>  <br>  Acer ... when it comes to recoveries, they are on the level of "run away screaming".. if you can't get into windows, you have to launch the recovery using an alt+f10 combination which results in a couple of broken fingers and a short temper. Oh and if you set a password, I hope you still remember it, otherwise you're buying the recovery disks from acer.<br>  <br>  Sony, acer, HP, toshiba, (and now packard bell) = hdd based recovery, don't make your disks and the recovery doesn't start? you have to buy them.<br>  <br>  acer, fujitsu siemens, toshiba... just hope you don't need to go onto their website for support. You'll need a map, a compass and 7 days of rations and a GPS locator.<br>  <br>  <br>  Packard bell are definitely slipping on their support now that acer have them in their clutches. a lot of changes were made. Acer's trick of not actually including half the models they sell on their own website is beginning to show on the PB site in the backwater areas. how long before you can't get support for the newest machines too?<br>  <br>  <br>  Go for something with:<br>  <br>  a website you can trust. If you can find stuff easily on their website, all the better.<br>  <br>  Branded components. It doesn't help if a manufacturer calls your mobo "oyster" or some other re-branded name that doesn't help you find drivers or bios updates, but you do find a decent fish restaurant instead.<br>  <br>  Watch out for the security measures on any machine. It can range from the mildly annoying tattoo for the PB (supposed to be secret codes but google is your friend) to bios locks, dmi information and the compaq/hp "call out an engineer, they've changed the mobo" which stops the recovery media working.<br>  <br>  A lot can be said about avoiding manufacturers and building your own.. at least you know what goes in it!|`|AUfiJaNFaa	Worst brand is every single PC,   the best is definetly Mac!!

In 1986 their computers were among the first IBM PC compatibles sold in retail chains such as Sears and Circuit City.   In 1995 Compaq sued Packard Bell for not disclosing that Packard Bell computers incorporated previously owned parts.<br>  <br>  The company was the subject of several lawsuits and paid millions of dollars in settlements. In 2005 PC World Magazine ranked the Packard Bell computers of 1986–1996 as the worst PCs manufactured of all time.<br>  <br>  In 2000, Packard Bell was withdrawn from the U.S. market.  In January 2008, Acer announced that it had acquired a controlling interest of 75% in the parent company of Packard Bell due to rights that it had acquired when it purchased Gateway, enabling Acer to counter offer any third party bid on Packard Bell.<br>  <br>  Packard Bell is now in the same corporate family as Gateway, a former competitor.|`|DQtD9P9Haa	Brand: Mac<br>  Operating System: Mac OSX

q7MIcWBBaa	it's fact .. i don't think you'll get band for speaking about facts .. on the other hand, if you made a mockery of the fact i could see it happening .. but considering it's been medically proven, i don't see how you'd get banned .. <br>  <br>  honestly a lot of things factor into it .. like placement on his lap, how hot the laptop runs, if he used an undermat cooling device, length of time he used it on his lap, prior sperm count before he began using it on his lap, etc.<br>  <br>  honestly 2 years is a long time to be using it on your lap and if it's been heavy, daily use on his lap for lengthy periods of time i would suggest he go see a doctor and have an acurate sperm count panel done .. <br>  <br>  if, for example, he used it on his knees, than no his sperm count shouldn't have been affected, if he slouched and used it directly over where the little guys live than he may very well have caused some serious issues .. <br>  <br>  it all depends, and no one here can trully answer that .. his best bet is to go see a doc and STOP using it on his lap .. unless he uses a lapmat style table thing (a big pillow w/ a table on top for laptop use)<br>  <br>  hope this helps!<br>  <br>  EDIT - for sexy scottish .. i'm not trying to get banned either but it seems explanation is needed .. it's not just a scary story .. it's true that laptops can cause sterility .. here's why .. your testicles require a certain temperature for them to function and produce sperm correctly .. sperm is delicate and requires that they testicles constantly stay a few degrees lower than body temperature .. hence the reason why they hang .. when you get cold, it shrivles up to try and get warm and maintain proper temps .. now .. when you put a laptop running at 50oC (122oF) .. and add prolonged use directly over this sensitive area .. the high temperature will cause your little guys to die and eventually cause production of the little guys to malfunction due to increased, prolonged, extreme temperatures .. think of it like this .. if you put your skin in extreme cold for a prolonged period of time your skin dies, you get frostbite and lose a limb .. if you put yourself in too much heat, your body gets dehidrated, you lose functionality of parts, and you eventually die .. your testicles are a lot more sensitive to these conditions than your body is .. so .. no it's NOT just a scary story .. YES it can cause serious damage .. don't underestimate the "story" because it is all too true!<br>  <br>  EDIT 2 - going to leave my ramble there because that's how i feel! and that's what I was always told ..  but .. as per this article, the seriousness it yet undetermined .. a lot factors into it .. some cases may be reversible (if givin a long enough time to heal and properly recover) and if not enough time is given and use continues, it may be irreversible .. but not enough is known about the issue yet to be 100% accurate .. best bet, don't do it until more studies are done!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/laptop.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/lap...</a><br>  <br>  i've read 4 articles on it so far (the original from 2004 and updates) and each varies .. some say reversible, others say irreversible, some say a testicle temp increase of 5oF some say 37oF .. <br>  <br>  all in all .. don't do it .. it's not worth it since we apparently don't know enough about it to make a sound medical judgement call on the issue yet|`|OKfK3kB2aa	Well most of us can talk big boy language like "reduced sperm" and "heating of the testicles"<br>  <br>  It's only temporary damage, in about oh I don't know 4 hours, his sperm will be back to normal.<br>  <br>  Really unless he's using a Pentium 4 laptop, like I had, he isn't risking anything.<br>  <br>  TL:DR he can keep doing it, it doesn't cause any permanent damage.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	You can tell him now|`|7TqFISbtaa	Looks like its too late for him ..His future wife may have to go to the sperm bank for help to have children <br>  <br>  Just joking ....He'll be ok , I think some one just made that story up to scare people into not using laptops<br>  <br>  In todays world we are getting telt everyday that something is bad for us

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE.

It is completely irrelevant when you're using the Internet, however. It simply identifies the different devices on the LAN.

You can actually get away with it but you will each get a "Duplicate IP" error message.  You will probably want to set this up with the DHCP Server on which means that the router will hand out the IP Addresses to the users.  <br>  <br>  Now comes the question of how to control who gets on the router and who doesn't.  The easiest way is to set up the WEP key and give the key to only the ones you want to have it.<br>  <br>  Depending on how technical you are, my preferred way to control access is to set up a MAC filter which will only allow registered MAC address on to the router.  This is a little more complicated but not undoable even as a novice if you read the instructions.  They will be in the manual that you can download from the manufacturer.|`|UQgOKnvDaa	The modem will have a specific IP address that will be seen by all outside entities outside your home network.

Most games aren't even optimized for two cores, let alone four- so there aren't major benefits from running quad-core processors when it comes to gaming.  Given the higher price of quad-core processors, the best value comes from having a high-speed dual-core processor instead and, putting that extra money into a better graphics card or more RAM, instead of the CPU.<br>  <br>  I don't know how strong of a power supply your computer has currently, you may need to upgrade the PSU in order to use a better graphics card.<br>  <br>  A huge upgrade from your GeForce 8500GT would be the $150 midrange cards like the GeForce 9800GTX+ or Radeon 4850  which usually run fine with a 450W power supply.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121284" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121272" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  The level of performance above those are $200-$250 cards like the Radeon 4870 or GTX 260 Core 216.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102801" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150330" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  If you've got the money, those are ideal for hardcore gaming.

Look up your motherboard online if you can't figure it out from looking at it and get the specs from the manufacturer.<br>  You should not need to change your processor at all, unless you are also changing your motherboard to fit the new graphics card, which seems kinda backwards to me. . .|`|blyK166Zaa	Well, It would be better to know the specs of your current PC. So not knowing I'm just gonna say, good graphics cards that are out now that can run most demanding games would be EVGA 9800GTX or GX2 + on to the GTX280 +. Also ATI Raedon has good cards as well.

HD7L65fXaa	Typically parsers generate syntax trees, or more specifically, Abstract Syntax Trees.  The how part is: bottom up.  As each part of the input that corresponds to a leaf node is parsed, the corresponding leaf node is built.  Then when all of the parts of a syntactic construct have been parsed, the parent node representing that construct is built on top of the children generated by the parser.  This process continues in a bottom-up fashion until the root of the syntax tree is built, representing the entire parsed entity (typically source file a.k.a. compilation unit).
3d6bn4Qzaa	You do not configure the NAT on your router, NAT is a property of the network, not a setting.  NAT stands for Network Address Translation, it is how your router decides which computer to send specific data.  Each computer uses the same port 80 to access the Internet, how does the router keep it all straight?  Well, that would be NAT; the router adds a partial address to each data stream, divided up by time, which the built-in switch on your router reads and sends to each specific port based on the address.  <br>  <br>  I do not have an Xbox, but you may need to forward ports for your Xbox, especially if you are planning on serving a game.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Help Online.<br>  =<br>  <a href="http://forum.teamxbox.com/archive/index.php/t-135051.html" rel="nofollow">http://forum.teamxbox.com/archive/index....</a><br>  =<br>  <a href="http://www.wyckedone.net/2006-09-23/xbox-360-and-the-netgear-router/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wyckedone.net/2006-09-23/xbox...</a>

Next at the light house there is a floating old picture get it and go to the photo place. talk to the man and trade it for scuba diving gear. go back to the light house and talk to the captain. put on diving suit and dive down to get the lobster. it is located at the bottom right corner. go back up and talk to the captain he will give you keys to his boats and let you keep the lobster. Next go to top of the light house and use the lobster it will turn the light around and scare the bird away. Now go on the boat and race Nate to the island. once you beat him you will see paper push the two top seals to the left all the way and get the paper. it is the map of where the time capsule is! Ok now go to the playground and go inside the house at the top. play hangman (the answers changes if you quit) and get peanut crackers from Nate. Next go to the school and go in the science lab. go to the potions kit thing and mix blue and yellow. and put the temperature on 4. now that you have the stink bomb go to the locker full of stuff. the code is 9305. when it opens there is something in the pile the blueprints of the school. then go and chew your gum. you go in detention and use the stink bomb. the teacher go's away. then go to the green cabnit and click on it. go down and turn on the light switch. in the room you see a kid rescue him then at the top of the room its the school bells ringer. get it and go to the top of the school. put it in and the girls in the playground will move. Go to the playground and put the crackers where the girls were talking. the dog will dig a hole and the capsule is there open it and then read and then you get the medal !!!!!!!!!

OiT5SJM8aa	Your need to minimize the amount of cycles you make your battery go thru in order to get the best of it.<br>  <br>  A cycle = 1 discharge and 1 recharge.<br>  <br>  That basically answers all your questions. You should charge your battery and remove it once it's full, only use the battery if you're on the move, otherwise, keep your computer plugged and the battery (fully charged) out.<br>  <br>  Do not keep the battery empty for a long time. The chemistry in it (Lithium ion) doesn't like that.<br>  <br>  Also just so you know, no matter if you follow this rule all the time, your battery will lose some of its capacity with time.  I agree with some people that say about 15% to 20% of the capacity of your battery will decrease over a year.... so after 2 years 1/2.... your battery will die twice faster.... no matter what.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	The responder above me is incorrect. Lithium-Ion batteries don't suffer from "memory effect". That's common in Ni-Cad batteries. Read on:<br>  <br>  Yes, you can leave it it or take it out. Doesn't matter, unless you want to charge the battery. Then you have to leave it in, obviously.<br>  <br>  Yes, it charges while the laptop is on.<br>  <br>  Here's how you care for a battery:<br>  <br>  About once a month, run the laptop until the battery runs completely down. Once you get warnings that the battery is low, log out of the operating system, but leave the laptop on until it powers off on its own.<br>  <br>  Then, charge the battery up with the power off. You should leave the charger plugged in for about an hour longer than it takes for a full charge...I suggest you do this overnight while you're sleeping.<br>  <br>  What this does is drains the battery almost empty (there's always a tiny charge left in LI-ON batteries), and allows you to recalibrate the capacity. LI-ON batteries have a small chip in them that manages the charging and regulated the amount of charge it holds. Draining and recharging helps the chip "remember" how much the battery can hold.<br>  <br>  This will prolong the life of your battery.<br>  <br>  How long it will last is impossible to predict. Some last for years. It all depends on how you use it and the environment where you live.|`|dILqe7nBaa	<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c01297640" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Extend-the-Life-of-a-Laptop-Battery" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Extend-the-Life-o...</a>|`|9kfjIRLyaa	They do charge when the are in the computer. But there is something called the "memory effect." If you go on battery power for an hour lets say and it gets down to 80% and you plug it into the outlet, this is bad. You should let it get down to like 5% or 10%, or preferably lower. Otherwise, your battery will never be able to fully charge, even though it says it is fully charged. That's what happened to mine. It said I had 100% battery left, and then it told me that is 30 minutes worth of power.|`|Imw1cGohaa	if you do what you were planing if would improve the life of your battery, its not necessary but it  is better for the battery. what i do is leave the battery in until it is fully charged then, if i am leaving it plunged in for more then 5hours) i take out the battery until i need it, again not necessary but the life of the battery will improve. when you take the battery out insure the the connectors are clean and have no black grime on them, if they do, use a small amount rubbing alcohol on a qtip to clean them (insure it dry before you put it back in your laptop)<br>  <br>  as to how long battery last it all depends on how much you use them, if your killing it and recharging it every day you might get 2 years, if you use you battery once a week i could last 10, it also depends on your laptop, if you have a good one the internal charger is most likely good and there for better battery life but it you have one that you got for $250, most likely to be a garbage and therefor s*** for battery life. and then there's the battery its self, if you get a good one, you may never have an issue with it, but there have been many recalls on batterys and there's always the one or to bad ones out of a shipment of 1000.and you also have to watch when you charge it, the lower the better (5-10%) because when you charge a battery that still has a charge it lowers its life <br>  <br>  But it your do something like what you or i said you could also get 10years, my laptop at work is 5 years old and i have only lost 10 min of total battery life... so its all a toss up >_<

0178LGMraa	My first recommendation is to turn the laptop upside down and put it gently on its head, make sure it is closed when doing this.<br>  <br>  Then locate the lock mechanism for the battery. Normally it is a sliding piece. Assuming this, slide the piece open and take out the battery. Then sniff the battery bay to see if there is a burnt smell. Hopefully this is not the case. Could be your motherboard is fried which is the worst case senario. Gently put the battery back in place after a few minutes. Turn the laptop back over, and try the power button again. <br>  <br>  HP laptops are known to have battery issues, not sure about Sony's. Hope this helps.

Open My Computer<br>  Right-click on C:<br>  Click Properties<br>  Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.<br>  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)<br>  5. Restart.

The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.<br>  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.<br>  <br>  Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed.

AA10906001	Basically you need to alter the software not to use the registry if you want to accomplish this.  Many programs uses COM and this almost always requires extensive use of the registry.<br>  <br>  Anyways, the tool you are looking for is called "Regmon" by SysInternals [subsidiary of MS] (Google it)|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Try a program like Total Uninstall.  (You'll have to learn to read its data file.)|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Apart from the registry entries, they need a set of library files matching their requirements. Without these they will not work. Also most software now has activation keys, which required contacting the software provider. This will always fail if the program has been loaded on another machine.

If the leaver is going its probably a problem with paper being jammed, if u can hear the spool feeding the paper but you dont hear the pin going back and forth then it could be broken, or out of ink. If both seem to be working and sounds going but nothing going to paper, either tip of pins busted, ink isnt properly put in, or inks run out.|`|Imw1cGohaa	if you have had it for a few years and it is still making noise (the printer head moving back and forth) then yes you most likely need more ink|`|C86VEyPNaa	yeah you need to post this question in electronics

U4Y4lCNtaa	Well, there are lots of things you need to do to maintain a computer. You need to defragment the hard drive weekly, or fortnightly. If you  don't do that, then the computer will gradually slow down, and the RAM will be come more and more unusable. I would recommend buying an external hard drive. Probably a 1TB one, they are only about $150ish now. Backup all your files and music to it, and anything else you don't want to lose. Then, put the recovery disk into your CD / DVD drive. And it will come up with some options. Click the option that says "Format hard drive to entire partition". Then, it will wipe the drive, and clear ALL the crap that was on it. From there, reinstall programs you need, and copy back music and other files you backed up, back onto you computer. The computer should be alot faster with this done. Then, make sure to defragment your drives every week or so. To do this, simply click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter.<br>  <br>  Have any probs? Email me<br>  <br>  good luck mate|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Defrag the HDD<br>  Run disk cleanup|`|tre6r4Jmaa	Keep your computer defragged and you should look into a portable external hard drive.

Put your computer on a clean hard surface, and take the side panel off the case. if there is dust and grime allover everything, you should go get some Q-tips and some rubbing alcohol and clean everything off. Make sure the computer is unplugged first please, I don't need to be sued for telling you do do this and getting you hurt. Also turn the computer on with the case open and make sure the fans are running.<br>  <br>  Bad power supply. If your whole computer shut off like you said, the power supply could be failing. The best way to check this is to look up the wiring diagram on your specific model, and hook it up to a diode, resistor, and LED in series. that way you can see if the output is correct by watching if the LED turn on or not. You can also get PSU testers, but they are expensive. You can get a second PSU, but that takes time and costs money as well.<br>  <br>  Bad Video Card. If your computer turns on fine, and you hear some beeping noises coming from inside the case, the computer is telling you what is wrong. Get your motherboard manual out, and listen to the beeps. Then look up what the sequence means. Some boards will also come with a seven segment LED display, that will show an error code if there is something wrong. Oh, and you can try putting a different vid card in and seeing if that fixes the problem.<br>  <br>  Bad motherboard. Your board could also be going bad itself, though that would not be specifically limited to the graphics output. There really isn't any way to test that, aside from getting known good parts and seeing if the problem still persists. That costs a lot of money and time, and you will be stuck with a spare everything if it is indeed the board.<br>  <br>  I recommend testing the video card, checking for over-heating/ fan operation, and possibly testing the PSU.<br>  <br>  Do remember that your computer PSU can kill you if you don't check it properly, so if you feel at all uncomfortable doing it take it to a professional. I only say that because if you short the wrong pins, you are dead. There are very large capacitors inside the PSU and you don't want to be their ground connection.|`|f48867afb4b62f25c631384ec6eadc17aa	It sounds like your video card went up or lost its drivers.

8QWr77YZaa	Yeah you are good to go.  The ddr2 on the motherboard is referring to the ram required not the video ram.  <br>  <br>  It has 1 pciex16 slot which is exactly what you need for your nvidia 9800.<br>  <br>  It will run fine.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	Yes they are compatible. The DDR2 is the Ram needed for the mother board and CPU. The DDR3 is the Ram that the video card has on it already. I hope this helped.

You should be able to hit ctrl+alt+delete twice to pull up a log-in screen again and re-enter administrator and whatever password you may have. That will take you to a command prompt “C:\ documents and settings/administrator.” Now you are in business. Simply type "control” at the prompt and press enter. This should bring up a message that allows you to enter Windows recovery function, and it will also open the control panel. Click on Administrative Tools and then Local Security Policies to bring up the settings. On the left side bar you can select Local Policies and then Security Options and Enable the Administrator Account the same way you may have disabled it. <br>  Then I would consider creating a logon account for the others that use your computer, and don't give them admin rights!  or poweruser either since they could upgrade to to full admin themselves.  Technically, no one should use an account with admin priviledges for day to day computer usage.  any virus you get will have the same rights...
pOaE0fWOaa	You have a very nice board there. The IGP, (onboard Radeon 3200), is no match for the GF 7800. The integrated video uses sytem RAM, which slows it down too much to compete. For most purposes, the onboard will work fine. You won't really enjoy gaming with it. It will allow you to have a relatively OK experience, iy is just that the GF will play games so much faster. BTW, that is about all that you should find it lacking in. Video will play tickety boo, no matter what the source. The onboard will allow you to use 2 monitors, as well. Load it up with lots of RAM and try it, I'm sure you will see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

However, if available seriously consider the upgrade in speed and the cost, often for the amount of money spent and the little increase in performance it may not be worth the upgrade.

If you can even find a new laptop processor, you will most likely have to tear the entire laptop apart in order to even access the processor, and I'd be willing to bet if you paid someone to do it (Geek Squad or otherwise), it'd probably be cheaper to buy a whole new laptop.<br>  <br>  If you're upgrading because your laptop is sluggish, upgrade your RAM. If you're using Vista try Speed Boost (you can use a USB flash drive or SD card as virtual RAM). Other than that, you're basically stuck with what you bought.

It would be a good idea to put a password on it, so people can't access your internet and use your usage.

peFufWeYaa	When a DVD burner prepares a file to get burned onto a disk it first takes it and recodes it to a much larger file. For instance, lets say you have a movie file that is 700mb and you wish to burn a DVD from it. The first thing the burner will do is decompress it to a file of about 3g in size<br>  <br>  If could be that you do not have enough free disk space on your computer. It could also be that your computer or disk drive is is just unable to read a file that large all at once and read it fast enough<br>  <br>  Burning and so forth will take all your processor and memory, so turn off all your other tasks, but also make sure you have plenty of free disk space, well over 5g at least<br>  <br>  Also, you can try and chapter your movie, do not burn the whole movie as one, and this may help. Look for the option in Nero and it should ask how many chapters you want, you know, so it will play like a store bought DVD<br>  <br>  Finally, if you are still having trouble, burn the movie to your hard disk first, make sure it plays, then transfer those files to your DVD without the burner software. Once you format your blank DVD you should just be able to copy and paste them to that with the roxio or drive letter or whatever built in burner software that you have included with windows|`|XRgmpvweaa	This DVD Creator is a good choice.

It is a problem created and propogated by the phone companies.<br>  <br>  Caller ID is an example of this.  People want to know who is calling so they provide the feature of Caller ID and charge you for it. Telemarketers want to be anonymous, so the phone companie allows them to be "Anonymouse". Customers then want to block Anonymous so the phone company provides that service (for a fee) to prevent Anonymous from coming through. Telemarketers then want to be "Out of Area", Phone compnay provides that feature, Customers want to block so they can (for a fee). Telemarketers then want to use fake phone numbers, etc. etc. <br>  <br>  See how it propogates?  There is a broadcast of the ADS system (what 911 operators use) that you can tap into, but it takes specialized equipment and may be illegal in your area.<br>  <br>  I personally tried several software/hardware options, but my final  solution was much more direct. I Fired the phone company. I simply told them that I have a cell phone and Road Runner for Internet, and they do not have any services I need, so my land line was removed.  In the U.S. Cell phone have more protections. It is illegal to solicite to a cell phone (since the owner pays for all connections to it). I also never give it out unless I NEED to hear from somebody. If I am asked by any organization or company or store for a phone number , or even the pizza place, I simply say No, or I provide them with a fictional number. <br>  <br>  Phone companies created the problems, and organizations abusing the information have made it worse, so turn about is fair play.

They are also more costly. Rewriting a disc will not cause poor sound quality, especially if you erase it correctly. And the disc should be almost infinitely rewritable, or until it gets scratched.

Use symantec, do not use norton or mcafee, mcafee is just bad.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Antivirus applications are useless and don't offer protection, because they operate retroactively instead of proactively.<br>  <br>  Think about it. If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. It's the only way to know the malware is completely gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8.

My address and phone number is on whitepages.com. It even says my parents ages. I want the info gone and back just like you, and if you can find out how, please tell me. but the actual minor panic attack i just had helped me to get some help and discover the info we gave isn't anything special, they could have picked it up anywhere... Nothing bad should happen. But, just in case...<br>  <br>  Your not the only one. stupidly i gave my info, and he called. i let it go to voicemail and never called back, but now I'm scared about all that info being out there. I dont know if you read the privacy policy in the terms of use, but they can sell our info to any affiliates or third parties... Im really hoping they just forget about the whole thing and mark me as a no show and forget my information... but If you find out, will you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know. I can't sleep because of it.
8dQC1r3Oaa	There may be the following solutions:<br>  1.check setting of volume on your window xp,make sure you have turn it up to maximum;<br>  2.Make sure your headset plug in the right output or your loudspeaker power on.<br>  3.check the driver of your sound card on your window xp, make sure that it works correctly.<br>  4.scan your computer with antivirus software to see whether it has some virus .
qmWEGycFaa	Nope. <br>  The router sends the signal. You need something to receive the signal from the router. <br>  <br>  A USB wireless adapter will do the trick.|`|A0uqbBTiaa	It depends upon the routers you're using, you can configure some routers to act as a wireless bridge.<br>  <br>  You might be able to do that with the router set up as an access point, but again, it depends upon what router you're using.
vo42ZRPdaa	they are too few lanes and often resemble the golden gate or the odd one that looks like the one in Brooklyn

hXHBm1BSaa	These cables are really meant for hard wiring a building. They will perform better if you fit CAT5E or better wall boxes and modules. Then use patch cables for the shortest distance you can.|`|vo42ZRPdaa	RJ45's are the terminators for the cat 5 cable remember to terminate the connectors correctly and the 8 wires are firmly placed and crimped if you put the wrong wire in the wrong position you will not have correct connection<br>  think 8 colour strand  blue /green/red/brown/etc <br>  if you need twisted pair or pass thru connections make sure its right<br>  best to buy pre-made cables it will be worth it not having the aggravation and having to buy the tools too|`|AA10906001	When you buy the cat5e cable ask them to point you to the connectors -- they'll make sure you get the right ones.  Also, I recommend you buy a crimping tool -- it makes it a lot easier to build custom cables that work reliably.|`|TeuFGmTlaa	you may get information from here<br>  <a href="http://www.souriau-industrial.com/en/news/products_focus/a_plastic_ethernet_rj45_solution" rel="nofollow">http://www.souriau-industrial.com/en/new...</a><br>  <br>  best of luck.

Yhey'll work fine with Xbox|`|vo42ZRPdaa	are you using a a router? or hub?<br>  or direct to the modem??<br>  you might have the wrong type of cat5 cable and why do you want it so long?|`|KtQdOqHKaa	That cable should be fine for what you want.  The length limit for ethernet is 100 meters, so you are well within specification.  Being cat-5e, it will handle gigabit speeds if both ends support that (I can't recall if the xbox360 supports it, but your router probably only has a 10/100 switch built in, but it will save you having to buy a new cable if you ever upgrade).
AA10906001	Compared to other appliances in your house, a computer uses virtually nothing.  You can run most computers (with monitor off) 24/7 for virtually nothing.|`|OKfK3kB2aa	Could get a Net book, or a cheap light power use Linux desktop.|`|GKB5D6Ipaa	To be honest with you when your downloading your not using that much power, your CPU and GPU is not drawing that much power when there not being used for intense applications. Everyone thinks if you have a 600 watt power supply that you always using 600watts that's not really the case. You PSU only puts out what you need. If you don't need it then it wont put out all 600watts.
XMy5hyJ1aa	Depends on how well you delete, most of the time when you delete things through basic windows un-install most of the files are left over. A lot of space stays wasted, on the other hand if you use a program like Revo Uninstaller you get rid of all the left over files and you get more space back. But even still it takes a very large program (like Photoshop or Flash) to make a significant change. I went through and deleted about 20 programs and saved maybe 1 gig. If you want to get a lot of useless files try CCleaner, deletes files your not using anymore. If you don't wanna us CCleaner emptying your recycle bin saves a lot fast.|`|TfdH0N47aa	Your question doesn't make any sense. Do you mean can deleting programs restore a gigabyte of space?<br>  <br>  If you do mean this, if your program is a GB or more in size and you delete it, then yes you will recover the coinciding amount of space.<br>  <br>  If you go into control panel and add/remove programs, you can see the size of the program on the right hand side, you can click the size tab and have them arranged by size, this way you can see what programs are taking up the most space.<br>  <br>  Files that take up the most space are video files.|`|pA8lfKbJaa	Depends on the programs.  But typically, your biggest space hogs are songs and videos and photo collections.|`|yMchHj9eaa	yes it does|`|fuuWzEnKaa	yes deleting programs will restore memory, but it's not referred to as "gigabyte space", as a gigabyte is a measurement of that memory.  Deleting programs would free up hard drive space.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ULw1777caa	It will restore space.

It's incompatible with most desktop processors and is useful only in a server or workstation. The problem is that people who build workstations probably won't buy their motherboard off of someone like you, instead ordering it bulk from large retailers or from the manufacturer directly.<br>  <br>  And supermicro tends to have a poor reputation amongst desktop boards, though their server and workstation boards aren't bad.

You can ind out what your %PATH% is currently by typing:<br>  <br>  echo %PATH%<br>  <br>  on the command line.<br>  <br>  Your %PATH% should contain at least "C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS" and will usually contain more than that.<br>  <br>  It is surprisingly easy to lose your %PATH% variable.  Simply typing the command:<br>  <br>  PATH<br>  <br>  will empty your %PATH% variable and cause the problem you described.<br>  <br>  To change your %PATH% type this on the command line:<br>  <br>  PATH=C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS<br>  <br>  The program telnet.exe is in C:\WINDOWS\system32\telnet.exe on my computer.  If your path already contains "C:\WINDOWS\system32" then check to make sure that telnet.exe file exists.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, try downloading PuTTY and using that as your telnet client.

LF2oShTLaa	To start off on a site like this you will need to first make a Seller account on Ebay, But also need to make a Paypal account (from paypal.com) which will require you to have a active credit card. Or you can skip making that account, and just make it so you require winners to pay by other means (no credit cards, possibly money order, check) when you put your item up for sale. But just go to Ebay main page, and go to the upper right all the way at the top. Click sell, and it will bring you to a login/register page. Now you just make your account, and it will guide you through the rest of the process.

KHSOVxViaa	You can store files in a database as BLOBs (Binary Large Objects).<br>  <br>  There are advantages and disadvantages.<br>  <br>  Data access will not be as fast, but advanced searching and querying can locate desired files much more efficiently.<br>  <br>  This is normally used when at least part of the data has to be in the database, because of relationality. Processing efficiency and data integrity make it worth storing associated files in the database, rather than have to track them in a separate file structure.  Backups can be 2 files instead of 2000.<br>  <br>  Any modern database should do this - even the free developer versions, though performance will be slower with those.  You can store any type of file, though you also need to store associated MIME (file type) data so it can be decoded when extracted.<br>  <br>  I have successfully done this with SQL/Server (including Express), Oracle and MySQL.  Typical stored files include images (.jpg, .gif), documents (.doc, .pdf) or just plain text files.  No reason why you can't store .html, .xml or anything else you want.<br>  <br>  I don't know of many off-the-peg systems or components that will manage this; it would normally have to be written in a programming language that handles all the business logic of the website/application. Most languages that can talk to a database should be able to do this.  C#, Java, PHP, etc...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You do not generally store the files in a database. You store information pointing to the files. Or you store some text and build the document from that. This makes a dynamic web site, and is what the mysql database and php scripting is mostly about.

When I type "a" in on the command line and press enter, the input stream the compiler actually sees is "a\n".  This is why it is only going through the loop twice, it reads the a, continues with the loop, then reads the '\n' (which is the next char in the input buffer) which is not equal to 'a'.

NvwdFgzWaa	haha Ophcrack is a amazing program. i think you need Opcrack to be the only program on ur usb drive in order for it to work. -_^so it doesn't have to search for the iso u want to run. anyway running from Flashdrive should work, you just might have to fiddle with it. For XP it works just great for me from CD. it uses a brute force attack. it guesses words. a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaab aabb abbb bbbb abab<br>  baba abba baab lol guesses them all until it gets it.<br>  <br>  Vista i had a little trouble but thats only because of the fingerprint scanner my bro had =/ kept picking up the password as ROOT#123
fE7zhp3Caa	I know some HP laptops had a BIOS level power management bug that seriously underclocked the processor, and I think I remember hearing about something similar is some Dell models.<br>  <br>  Check with Dell to see if there's a BIOS update to correct your problem.  The processor speed should read low when you're idling, but it should come back up when you give it something hard to crunch.  Your CPU usage doesn't match so either the processor clock speed is being kept too low or the speed isn't being read or reported correctly.<br>  <br>  You might also want to blow out the ventilation with a can of compressed air.  Make sure you do this when the machine is off so you don't counteract the cooling of the fans.  That should help with the heat problem unless you've got a fan that's going bad or you set the laptop on your lap, a carpet, or a bed.  Soft surfaces can block ventilation and cause overheating, which will force the processor to slow down to minimize heat dissipation.

You can add new port configurations manually or select from a range of pre-configured ports for many popular applications and apply the settings directly to your router configuration. The program interfaces with the web interface of your router and basically automates the process of navigating to the correct page and entering the values. It is compatible with a wide range of routers, including most Netgear, D-Link and Linksys models as well as some other manufacturers. Simple Port Forwarding also includes additional features that allows you to set a static IP address, test your port forwarding settings, manage Windows Firewall port exceptions and access to online help and guides.<br>  Freeware; other port utilities on same heading.<br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/network/fwnetwork.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/networ...</a>

I got my parents to get me a computer when I was in school because I needed regular access to the internet for researching my homework, as well as needing to print book reports, essays and so on.  Microsoft office is good way to accomplish this since you need word to write essays, powerpoint (although i only needed this twice :P ) and now the new one Note included in the home and student edition is a useful program for taking notes in lectures, although Im not sure it would be applicable to school?  Obviously you can get free applications such as open office but your parents don't need to know that :P<br>  <br>  The only reason I suggest the educational value is because that is what is going to give you the most currency with them. Hope that helps

Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III.

xyQRD8ahaa	WFP protects system files by running in the background and detecting attempts to replace protected system files. WFP is triggered after it receives a directory change notification on a file in a protected directory. Once this notification is received, WFP determines which file was changed. If the file is protected, WFP looks up the file signature in a catalog file to determine if the new file is the correct Microsoft version. If it is not, the operating system replaces the file with the correct version from the dllcache directory or the distribution media.<br>  <br>  After detecting the replacement of a protected file, WFP searches for the replaced files in the following order:<br>  <br>  1.<br>   <br>  <br>  Search the dllcache directory.<br>  <br>  2.<br>   <br>  <br>  If the system was installed via network install, search the network install path.<br>  <br>  3.<br>   <br>  <br>  Search on the CD.<br>  <br>  If the file is found in dllcache or the install source is auto-located, WFP replaces the file without prompting the user and moves on. If the file cannot be found, WFP displays a dialog box that prompts the user to either insert distribution media or cancel the restore operation.<br>  <br>  WFP also logs an event to the system event log, noting the file replacement attempt. If the administrative user cancels the WFP file restoration, an event noting the cancellation is logged - thats all..<br>  <br>  But this is only for system files!!!

If you get a lot of "General Protection Fault" errors or memory read/write errors then you may have a failing block of memory.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend using a utility like Memtest86+ to check your memory for errors.  If it finds any errors you'll want to replace the memory stick or risk things getting worse.  Keep in mind that memory errors can give you all kinds of seemingly unrelated problems.  All programs that you run and all your files that you open get loaded into memory first .  That means anything can get garbled if part of it is written into a failing section of memory.<br>  <br>  If you bought the memory retail then you should be able to get an RMA number from the manufacturer and send it back for a replacement.  If it came with an OEM computer (Dell, HP, Gateway, eMachine, Compaq, etc.) then you have to go through them *if* it's still under warranty with them.  If it's not under warranty then you're out of luck and need to buy a replacement stick yourself.|`|rRHqAn3Aaa	When computers are running code, they have a list of instructions that they run in order.

The place that it was asked to look at (that second number), is actually off limits for most programs to use.  Basically, something went wrong with your program you were running.<br>  This is like your boss at work telling you to go to the Pentagon and count how many chairs are there, and you coming back and saying "they wouldn't let me in".<br>  Addresses that start with a lot of 0's are generally reserved for the operating system and system level data structures.|`|m9WerfrVaa	I have the same exact error message that you have and it is coming up everytime that I go to a new webpage or a popup occurs.

RIjLS2TLaa	replace the magenta int and go a print test|`|fE7zhp3Caa	The first thing you should do is check your ink levels to confirm that you're not out of magenta.  Most ink cartridges that are included with a printer are lower capacity than what you would buy to replace them.  It's a cheap move by the sellers, but there it is.<br>  <br>  The second step is to take out the magenta cartridge and reinstall it.  Sometimes the printer will get picky about how the cartridge is installed, and reinstalling the cartridge can sometimes appease it.<br>  <br>  If it still doesn't work, you'll want to make sure that the ink can be drawn from the cartridge like it should.  Many Canon, Lexmark, and Brother printers use sponge cartridges without print heads, so all you need to check one of those is a paper towel.  You should see a circular opening on the bottom of the cartridge.  Wrap your paper towel so that the opening is covered, and hold the cartridge so that with your arm down at your side the opening is down.  You want to snap your arm down 2 or 3 times, making sure that at the end of each snap that the bottom is pointing down.  This forces the ink down in the cartridge and clears any air obstructions.  Don't shake it.  That just creates more bubbles in the ink, and bubbles can clog print heads or cause splatters when they get pushed out.<br>  <br>  The paper towel should have a nice, wet circle of ink where it covered the opening.  Reinstall the cartridge and retest it.<br>  <br>  If your cartridges have print heads, you do the same snapping to force the ink down, but you follow that up by dragging it across the paper towel to remove any dried ink or contaminant that could come back and cause you problems.  Fold the paper towel so that you've got at least 4 layers, push the ink cartridge down on the paper, and drag it slowly along the line of the print head, twisting it back and forth very slightly as you drag.  You should get a dark, solid line of ink.  Reinstall it and test.<br>  <br>  Anything less and your ink is drying up or already dried up.|`|608d1f685421cf08291c4f9ce7135a0faa	You can try removing the magenta ink and shaking it a few times and reconnect it. If it doesn't work then you have to replace the magenta ink. You can also try shutting the printer off and restarting it again, cancel the previous documents.

Anyplace they get service, you can get internet.<br>  <br>  Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T all have these cards.<br>  <br>  Verizon has a $40 or $60 a month plan.<br>  <a href="http://b2b.vzw.com/broadband/bbapccard.html" rel="nofollow">http://b2b.vzw.com/broadband/bbapccard.h...</a><br>  <br>  I'm less sure about Sprint but I do believe that they also have  $60 a month plan.<br>  <a href="http://www.nextel.com/en/solutions/mobile_broadband/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextel.com/en/solutions/mobil...</a><br>  <br>  The thing to remember, is these services very often have similar pricing plans to cell phone internet access, and thus can be very pricy.|`|AA10867564	there are two basic options:<br>  <br>  1. a wireless modem or<br>  2. an Internet plan added to your cell phone.<br>  <br>  The wireless modem sucks. It costs $39-69/month, and they lock you into a long contract otherwise they will charge you 100-200 for the phone. Also, there's a download limit, where they charge you more after a certain amount.<br>  <br>  The internet plan is far better. It costs (at tmobile) 20/month, no long term committment (it's an added service to an existing plan) and no additional charges for going over the limit.<br>  <br>  There's no reason at all to get a wireless modem. At that price, you might as well get a regular cell phone + the internet plan.

uCzSEgT6aa	Try plugging and unplugging several times.  Sometimes they get finicky.  Next, check to make sure they are enabled in the BIOS.<br>  <br>  Turn off the computer, then turn it on, and while you do it should say press a key to enter setup.  Usually that key is delete, but could be F1 or ESC.  Once there, look for "Integrated Peripherals".  Go to it and press enter.  Look for USB anything related to USB and make sure it is enabled.  Press escape, then go to save and exit.  Exact wording may vary by BIOS vendor, but you should be able to figure it out.<br>  <br>  Also, try right clicking on "My Computer", go to "Properties", "Hardware", then "Device Manager".  Look for Universal Serial Bus controller.  If it is there, and there are no question marks next to it, then they should work.  If Windows does detect a problem, it will alert you in this window and give you a brief explanation.<br>  <br>  Finally, falling all else, and assuming you are using a desktop, you're going to have to buy a PCI USB Controller card.  Before buying a card, you should open up your computer and make sure you have an empty PCI slot to put the card in.  They look like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hothardware.com/reviews/images/tualatin/pci_slot.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hothardware.com/reviews/image...</a><br>  <br>  If so, a card can be had very cheap, like this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815106505" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  You put the card in the slot, windows automatically detects it, you put in the CD that comes with the card, and it takes care of the rest.  Bingo, four usable ports.<br>  <br>  If you have a laptop, and an available PCMCIA port, you can add ports with a card in a similar fashion, like with one of these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16839200001" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|dbb5c505997521bf0fb0c2324de40111aa	You need to go to Control Panel then System, Hardware then Device Manager, expand "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" then delete all "USB Root Hub" components.<br>  Reboot your computer and it will reinstall them with fresh drivers.<br>  This should solve your issue.<br>  Let me know.|`|OKfK3kB2aa	Try a basic restart, but honestly, its a fact of life, nothing last forever, USB ports might be fried.<br>  <br>  If you can manage to get one working, buy a USB hub, and use that.

I would suggest Realm Computers as I have bought from them before and am using it to type this right now. You can save a whole lot of money buying from them as they offer the cheapest, fastest computers around.<br>  <br>  And you can tell them exactly how you want it. Just send them an email if you have a specific case you like or want different color fans, etc.<br>  <br>  Their lowest model however is about $1300 the last time I checked. But it comes with a 3GHz quad core, 4 GB ram, GTX 260 and a terabyte hard disk. Perfectly capable of playing any new game out there. The specs of the computer are perfect as it is very powerful and you do not really need any more power than that to play current or future games in the next few years.<br>  <br>  I just looked on Alienware's website and customized the computer for the same specs as the Realm Computer and here are the prices.<br>  <br>  Realm NTS 30-$1300<br>  Alienware-$2500<br>  And these come with exactly the same components inside.|`|C2Q72z2Caa	Find a relative or co-worker who knows something about computers in your area.  You will want to find the computer that suits your needs for your budget and budget is the key in purchasing a computer. Buy it somewhere you know will keep it running for you. <br>  <br>  Spend more on the monitor as this can usually last though the life of many computers.  Your monitor will make or brake your computing experience.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you able to get support through the person or place you buy it from.  If you do not know anything about computers talk to professionals. <br>  <br>  In fact, I recommend Dell because they take care of everything I just mentioned.

When you create a string like you did on the line:<br>  "teSt Me ! ! !!a"<br>  You actually created a special kind of string called a string literal.  String literals are immutable.  In other words, all of the elements with the array are constants, they can't be changed.  As you saw with your program, when you try to change the value of element in a string literal, the program will segfault.<br>  <br>  If import the string.h header, you can fix the problem by changing the declaration of the string to:<br>  char string[20];<br>  strcpy(string, "teSt Me ! ! !!a");

FBQZ06vraa	Editing a document right out of an email is a dangerous practice.  Often the file that gets opened in Word is a temporary one and disappears totally when Word closes, so Saves to it are useless (Save As's to a different file are OK, but it's often hard to remember to do that.)<br>  <br>  It's usually better to save the file out of the email first, then open the saved file and work on it.<br>  <br>  All that being said, there's a slim possibility your file still exists in your temp directory:<br>  <br>  In Windows XP:<br>  <br>  C:\Documents and settings\your username\Local settings\temp<br>  <br>  In Windows Vista:<br>  <br>  C:\Users\your username\Local Settings\temp<br>  <br>  (Note:  You can’t open the Local Settings directory, however, if you type in the entire path name, right down to the “temp”, in the address window at the top of the screen, Windows will let you into the temp directory.)<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled by files that look almost like it:  Word also creates some temporary files that are useless to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	You're supposed to enter the doc name BEFORE you click Save.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. It's the only way to know the malware is completely gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8.

svqPSqJNaa	This is great!  Well, the first thing you need to figure is the types of games you want to run on the system.  Strategy games like Star Wars Empire at War, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, and Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars, shooters like Crysys, and simulators like The Sims 3 will require some medium-to-high-end graphics (512MB-1GB memory video card from ATI or nVidia).  4GB to 16GB of DDR3 or higher RAM (memory) is good.  A 2.4 GHz or higher AMD Phenom Quad-Core, or 2.4 GHz Intel Core2Quad/i7/or Xeon processor is ideal for the CPU.  At least a 160GB hard drive running at least 7200rpm on a SATA connection is decent.  More drive space and a faster rpm (rotations per minute) on the hard drive will increase performance.  Additionally, a SoundBlaster card will assist in taking away sound and audio processing duties from the processor chip and will allocate this function to a discrete audio card, freeing up some memory and processor cycles.  Some other things to consider is the chassis (metal/plastic framework of the system) and the peripherals.  The peripherals are the monitor, mouse and keyboard.  It is also a good idea for a dedicated gaming computer to look at any additional game controller devices as well.  My favorite is actually the wired XBox360 controller, but there are others as well.  These make playing the shooter games and flight simulators considerably easier.<br>  <br>  A good comparison to make is that while you are building your own system, check the components you think you want in the system from manufactured systems from Dell's XPS and Precision brands, Velocity Micro, Alienware (Dell), Hewlett Packard's Blackbird and Voodoo brands, and even Apple's MacPro towers.  These systems are considered to be gaming and graphics systems from the major manufacturers.  Apple's MacPro would need to use Boot-Camp and a user-install of a full version of WindowsXP or Vista for Windows gaming, but is still considered along with these others as a gaming and graphics rig.  Take a note of what HP, Dell, Apple and Velocity Micro put into these systems and in the way of audio, video, memory, hard drive, and processor and use this to create your own checklist of items for purchase.  One last thing to consider is the chassis of the system, and what size of motherboard will fit in that chassis.  Make sure that the chassis you get comes with at least a 500-watt power supply for a single video card system, or a 700-watt power supply for a dual/triple (Cross-Fire or SLI) video card system.  This is because these power supplies will have extra 6-pin power connectors for high-end gaming video cards.<br>  <br>  My particular home-built computer setup is using an Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz processor with 16GB of DDR3 memory, a 1GB RAM nVidia GeForce 9800 video card, a SoundBlaster XFi Audigy sound card, and a 10k rpm Quantum hard drive, and a Pioneer Blu-Ray ROM with DVD & CD burning drive.  Since the chassis is in a small box/large shuttle micro-ATX form, and I am only using a single video card, and I am not overclocking either the processor or video card or memory, I am using a 550-watt power supply.  But if you intend to add more than one video card or to add even more components in a larger chassis than this, you should opt for a 700-watt power supply.<br>  <br>  One last thing to consider is using Windows Vista Ultimate.  This may sound silly considering all of the complaints about Vista at this time, but Vista Ultimate in either it's 32 or 64 bit versions will offer good backwards compatibility on a high-end gaming system.  It also has DirectX 10 and OpenGL 3.0 included in the installation.  XP right now only supports DirectX 9, but may have OpenGL 3 support.  Additionally, using Vista Ultimate, and I mean ULTIMATE, not the Home Basic or Home Premium versions of Vista also has better security support and better multi-processor and single multicore processor support as well over the lower versions of Vista and XP.|`|GKB5D6Ipaa	www.evga.com and find the forums under community then go to Mod Rigs and make a post that you would like some help with your first PC build tell them Jplace003 sent you here for some help you will be surprised by how many knowledgeable people help you there.|`|9apLgksXaa	If you are going to build your computer, i would have at least 4 GB, at least a quad core, and the new GTX 260 is in the perfect price range for performance.

It will be alot cheaper than Alienware and dell xps and such but the only company I know that does not make enormous profits are Realm Computers. Check them out, If you want the perfect price/performance ratio, then they are for you.<br>  <br>  If you are going for a cheap high performance system then the only 2 ways are building it yourself or buying it from Realm as they offer about the same price as it would take you to build it yourself and they give a 3 year warranty for any component failure.

fE7zhp3Caa	UDP is a network protocol that should already be available on your system (it's part of the TCP/IP suite, so if you're online then it's there).  Check Windows Firewall options (or whichever firewall you're using) to make sure it's not being blocked.<br>  <br>  For Windows Firewall on XP, go to Start -> Control Panel -> Windows Firewall and look at the exceptions tab.  If your program is not listed you can manually create an exception for either the UDP port you need left open or for the program itself.

To add the program, click on Add Program, locate the main EXE for your game, and click OK.<br>  <br>  Be very careful when you create firewall exceptions.  If you specify the port only than anything trying to use that port will be allowed through.  Double check yourself and only manually add exceptions when you have to.

No with CSS, nor with on-line arguments.<br>  If the image is 1000 px wide, it will be displayed as 1000 px wide, full stop.<br>  That means on an 800 resolution, 200 pixels will be invisible.<br>  On a 1280 wide, you will have 280 pixels blank.<br>  You "could" detect the browser resolution and let the browser resize the image, but no browser resizes "neatly" (the image is rather crappy).<br>  The other way is to design images of 800, 1024, 1280 and 1660, (th standard widths) then to select and download the correct image.|`|0AMmBDdRaa	add "float:left;" in the style.
