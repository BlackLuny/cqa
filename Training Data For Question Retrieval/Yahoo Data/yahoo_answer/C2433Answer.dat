They also have to be able to rhyme. www.rhymezone.com is a great source for finding rhymes. Also, the best way to make sure the lines will work inverted is to start one of them with a "who" "with" "where" "that" or "so". <br>  So... ideas. <br>  It doesn't need to be brilliant, if it's for a school project just get it done.

They're harder than you most likely want but they have serious depth to them. Additionally, I would read books by Ayn Rand -- just remember she's not the end of philosophy as her tone sometimes manages to suggest. "History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russell is also a good first read; however, it is dated and lacks depth at times. Read "Closing of the American Mind" by Allan Bloom to see a philosophical mind at work examining America in the 1980s. After that try the main texts below:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plato -- The Republic, The Laws<br>  Aristotle -- Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Metaphysics<br>  Thucydides -- The War of the Peloponnesians and the Athenians<br>  St.Augustine -- The City of God<br>  Dante -- The Divine Comedy<br>  Maimonides -- the guide of the Perplexed<br>  St. Aquinas -- Summa Theologica<br>  Machiavelli -- The Prince, The Discourses on the First ten books of Titus Livius<br>  Bacon -- New Atlantis, Advancement of Learning<br>  Descartes -- Discourse on Method, Meditations<br>  Hobbes -- Leviathan<br>  Locke -- Two Treatises of government, An essay concerning Human Understanding<br>  Milton -- Paradise Lost<br>  Shakespeare -- Hamlet, King Lear,<br>  Spinoza -- Theologico-Political Treatise<br>  Hume -- Treatise of Human Understanding, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding<br>  Rousseau -- Social Contract, Discourse on the Sciences and Arts<br>  Smith -- The Wealth of Nations<br>  Burke -- Reflections on the Revolution in France<br>  Kant -- Critique of pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason<br>  Hegel -- Phenomenolgy of the Mind<br>  Marx -- Capital<br>  Nietzsche -- Beyond Good and evil, Thus spoke Zarathustra<br>  Husserl -- Logical Investigations<br>  Heidegger -- Being and Time<br>  Wittgenstein -- Philosophical Investigations<br>  Popper -- The Logic of Scientific Discovery, The open Society and its Enemies|`|yUudoO1Raa	Early in the 20th century an educator with no background in philosophy, but having the desire to know, developed The Great Books of the Western World and taught himself philosophy.<br>  <br>  He also taught the world, because that series of books became the best selling collection of philosophy in the world.<br>  <br>  Read volumes II and III.

It's like saying: "If you understand what's right, what's wrong, if you know how to define justice, etc., you will act better and live better."<br>  <br>  It's far from sophistic, rhetoric and science. Sophistic is a common based knowledge. Many affirmations can be shown to be contradictory to themselves.  Rhetoric is the art of speaking and making others agree with you. Socrates shows in the Giorgia it is uuseful if you wanna see an example. Science is based upon observation. Each of these are well known and used very often in common days. But ppeopledoes even know they are doing so. <br>  What's the difference between these and philosophy? Criticism and questioning. Philosophy differs as it critic even the reliability of our sense and the limit of our potential. <br>  <br>  So, basically, you have to base yourself on basic ideas:<br>  -You can be right or wrong;<br>  -Truth is the only proposition which will not contradict itself;<br>  -Be true to yourself and act like you speak.<br>  <br>  For the third one, you have to give faith to your words and act by your conclusions. In other words, you cannot say A, and act B. But, this might be hard to do.<br>  <br>  The main purpose is the quest of truth. No opinions, no big questions, no big augmentations. Short answers to short questions. The ideal way of doing it is in a discussion. Question and answer. When you both disagree on a point, or even when you both say something, you have to prove yourself if you are right. If you need an example, read Plato's work, peculiarly those on Socrates. He uses this q and a and starts on basic questions of peculiar cases to end-up with a general meaning. <br>  <br>  In the end, it is majorly about answering a question within a discussion, if possible, ending in agreement and with a true statement and gaining knowledge. But, it's hard and rare you can achieve it.|`|AA11564934	I read "The Passion of the Western Mind" and really liked it.  it's an overview of Western Philo from Greeks on up.<br>  Of course there are a couple millenia of Asian philosophers as well, but that's a start|`|bljEhh86aa	a thought and ready to debate.

Q9lI5UViaa	There are rumors, that he dislike the Japanese as race, but he found an ally in them. But he never said something bad against the japs as race officially (and inofficial). Possibly the same thing could be with Muslims.<br>  <br>  To understand the collaboration of the Muslims with Hitler you need to go a step back in history. But first, keep in mind that islam is the head religion and that there are different style of practice and view among islam (for example see iraq today) and keep also in mind that moslems are human beeings with different nationalities and different interests.<br>  <br>  Allright, as far as i know the contact of germans and muslims started some years before and during world war one. The ottoman empire was ally to germany and lost with it. The ottoman empire vanished and Turkey was born some years later. Germany was in war with France, the British Comenwealth and Russia. The german gov hoped to destablize british parts in the world, which should force britian to sent soldiers there. soldiers who couldn`t fight then on the western front. One part they hoped to find in was Afghanistan. The german gov sended two german diplomants in a secret mission to Afghanistan. But the afghanian king couldn`t or wasn`t willed to do a war against the brits with german help, even he wanted really to get rid of the british occupation. So, the mission didn`t reached is goal, but set a long friendship to Afghanistan which reached untill the beginning of the Talibantime. The germans did fight against russian in world war one. Russia was big that time then and muslim russian soldiers from all parts of russia were forced to fight against german soldiers in the east, so the germans made muslim pows. its said the gemrans let them pray and even builed a wooden mosqe for the pows.<br>  <br>  The oldest mosque in german was builed between 1924 and 1927 by turkish workers with donatemoney. While in 1938 jewish synagoges burned and got destroyed in Berlin and all of germany, the mosque in berlin wasn`t touched. Got heavily damaged in the battle of berlin. Was later rebuiled and in 2007 it was closed, because not much money was found for restauration, even in berlin more then 150.000 muslims live today. <br>  <br>  It was easier for the moslems in the world to colaborate with the germans, because in the past no germans occupied them, like other european states, especially the britsh and the germans and muslims shared the them enemy in fight against the british. moslims fight for their independence. But not all moslems were friends with germany. Some muslims were allied to britian. <br>  <br>  Similiar in world war 2 a dude called "the grand mufit of Jerusalem", searched allies in fight against the british and the jews. He found an ally in hitler.<br>  The grandmufti rest some years in germany, paied with german taxes of the nazi gov, visited some concentration camp and pushed the nazis to increase the killing of the jews. Organised a muslim divison called Handschar and other stuff. Was later searched as a criminal.<br>  Details here--> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Amin_al-Husayni" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Am...</a><br>  <br>  It`s said he played an important role with the antisemitismn in palastine which is present up to this day.<br>  <a href="http://www.seraphicpress.com/images/PalestinianNaziSalute01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.seraphicpress.com/images/Pale...</a><br>  <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~jimsondergeld/Hitler_Uber_Allah.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://home.comcast.net/~jimsondergeld/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7130/1959/1600/arabic_meinkampf.0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7130/...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2257/2387802158_a8fec5e5d1.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2257/2387...</a><br>  <br>  Heinrich Himmler liked the Idea in islam, that wa warrior who died in battle fly direct into heaven. So the main reason for the collaboration, i guess, was because the "fight" against the jews and british, which were both enemies to arabs and germans in their ideology.<br>  <br>  Like in world war one the germans tried to destablize the britsh parts in the world in world war two.<br>  <br>  German special units of the german army, operated secretly in smal numbers in Plastine, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  Tried to managed revolts and cut off the allied from oilsupllies.<br>  <br>  It`s said if the Germans had won in Stalingrad, the turks would had come to fight with the germans. And the germans wanted marching down to the caspian sea to oilfield and then to iran and iraq to the oilfields there. Germans from the North and Germans of the Afrikakoprs from the south to Iraq. <br>  <br>  I guess that is lack of knowledge and people are stupid and believe everything the see and read in the media. The are frightend and fear Muslims.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Of course not all muslims are terrorists. I don't have a problem with muslims, but I do have a problem with extremists of any religious background. <br>  <br>  I live in Berlin  - many Turks live here and while some have integrated, other have lived for 2 or 3 generations in this country and do not speak a word of German.

Quite the opposite, in fact. The grand mufit of Jerusalem, uncle of Yasser Arafat, was very active in supporting the Nazis. He helped set up SS division Handschar, for example.

In the 1930s, the fascist regimes that arose in Italy and Germany sought greater stakes in the area, and began courting Arab leaders to revolt against their British and French custodians. Among their many willing accomplices was Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin el-Husseini, who fled Palestine after agitating against the British during the Arab Revolt of 1936-39. He found refuge in Iraq – another of Her Majesty's mandates – where he again topped the British most wanted list after helping pull the strings behind the Iraqi coup of 1941. The revolt in Baghdad was orchestrated by Hitler as part of a strategy to squeeze the region between the pincers of Rommel's troops in North Africa, German forces in the Caucuses and pro-Nazi forces in Iraq. However, in June 1941 British troops put down the rebellion and the Mufti escaped via Tehran to Italy and eventually to Berlin.<br>  The Nazi-Arab connection existed even when Adolf Hitler first seized power in Germany in 1933. News of the Nazi takeover was welcomed by the Arab masses with great enthusiasm, as the first congratulatory telegrams Hitler received upon being appointed Chancellor came from the German Consul in Jerusalem, followed by those from several Arab capitals. Soon afterwards, parties that imitated the National Socialists were founded in many Arab lands, like the "Hisb-el-qaumi-el-suri" (PPS) or Social Nationalist Party in Syria. Its leader, Anton Sa'ada, styled himself the Führer of the Syrian nation, and Hitler became known as "Abu Ali" (In Egypt his name was "Muhammed Haidar"). The banner of the PPS displayed the swastika on a black-white background. Later, a Lebanese branch of the PPS – which still receives its orders from Damascus – was involved in the assassination of Lebanese President Pierre Gemayel.<br>  <br>  The most influential party that emulated the Nazis was "Young Egypt," which was founded in October 1933. They had storm troopers, torch processions, and literal translations of Nazi slogans – like "One folk, One party, One leader." Nazi anti-Semitism was replicated, with calls to boycott Jewish businesses and physical attacks on Jews. Britain had a bitter experience with this pro-German mood in Egypt, when the official Egyptian government failed to declare war on the Wehrmacht as German troops were about to conquer Alexandria.<br>  <br>  After the war, a member of Young Egypt named Gamal Abdul Nasser was among the officers who led the July 1952 revolution in Egypt. Their first act – following in Hitler's footsteps – was to outlaw all other parties. Nasser's Egypt became a safe haven for Nazi war criminals, among them the SS General in charge of the murder of Ukrainian Jewry; he became Nasser's bodyguard and close comrade. Alois Brunner, another senior Nazi war criminal, found shelter in Damascus, where he served for many years as senior adviser to the Syrian general staff and still resides today.<br>  <br>  Sami al-Joundi, one of the founders of the ruling Syrian Ba'ath Party, recalls: "We were racists. We admired the Nazis. We were immersed in reading Nazi literature and books... We were the first who thought of a translation of Mein Kampf. Anyone who lived in Damascus at that time was witness to the Arab inclination toward Nazism."<br>  <br>  These leanings never completely ceased. Hitler's Mein Kampf currently ranks sixth on the best-seller list among Palestinian Arabs. Luis Al-Haj, translator of the Arabic edition, writes glowingly in the preface about how Hitler's "ideology" and his "theories of nationalism, dictatorship and race… are advancing especially within our Arabic States." When Palestinian police first greeted Arafat in the self-rule areas, they offered the infamous Nazi salute - the right arm raised straight and upward.<br>  <br>  The PLO and notably Arafat himself do not make a secret of their source of inspiration. The Grand Mufti el-Husseini is venerated as a hero by the PLO. It should be noted, that the PLO's top figure in east Jerusalem today, Faisal Husseini, is the grandson to the Führer's Mufti. Arafat also considers the Grand Mufti a respected educator and leader, and in 1985 declared it an honor to follow in his footsteps. Little wonder. In 1951, a close relative of the Mufti named Rahman Abdul Rauf el-Qudwa el-Husseini matriculated to the University of Cairo. The student decided to conceal his true identity and enlisted as "Yasser Arafat."
spYpsixUaa	As with anything worth doing, there are no shortcuts in philosophy.  This is not your high school algebra where the axioms can be proven to excise large chunks of your proofs through substitution.  While it is true that half of Logic is the mathematical precision of its rules, the other half is the relationship of its content to reality.  Algebra deals with variables which represent numbers, but Logic deals with labels (i.e., variables) which represent thoughts.  It's like saying that Social Security Numbers represent persons.<br>  <br>  Now, with my lecture out of the way, let me try to answer your question.  "It is always worse to commit injustice than to suffer injustice."  Is that like saying that it is always better to be victimized than to be guilty of something?  I think so.  So, where is the missing parts of it?|`|EPe2p55Eaa	dun u have someone better than this good for nothing doggies Shole? i have seem a lot and it's always about him and not the others.

But you don't prove principles, you either grasp them or do not.  If you grasp them or, in other words understand them, then you prove other minor theses upon the grounds of those, as Aristotle oft says "indemonstrable" 1st principles, which are grasped by intuition.<br>  <br>  The ground upon which a principle is grasped, accepted or understood is its SELF - EVIDENCE, to the person who grasps that principle. The basis of any SELF -EVIDENT principle is the inability or incompetence of any person who grasps that 1st principle to THINK that the logical opposite of a 1st Principle is or maybe true.<br>  <br>  Now, anyone who does not grasp a 1st principle may both think and say that the logical opposite of a 1st principle is true.  Hence the burden of proving their opposite or contradictory thesis is upon them to show or demonstrate to the person who has grasped a 1st principle.  And in trying to prove the logical opposite of a 1st Principle to anyone who actually grasps that 1st Principle, they will inevitably CONTRADICT themselves on a minor point of their attempted "proof".<br>  <br>  So the question is, can you think or prove to yourself --- because you  are talking about a PRINCIPLE which was self - evident to Socrates and may become self evident to yourself --- any logical opposite of that allegedly (to Socrates and Plato) self-evident PRINCIPLE???<br>  <br>  Of the 3 arguers (Gorgias, Polus and Callicles) who tried to refute that principle --- or merely laughed at it, at first, in the case of Callicles --- none convinced Socrates to abandon it and Socrates convinced all 3 that their arguments against the PRINCIPLE resulted in self - contradictory statements of their own.<br>  <br>  How Socrates was convinced of that principle, along with Plato, was their business.  How you may be convinced of the self-evidence of that PRINCIPLE, to yourself, is your self's business.  And since you speak of Socrates's ideas and Socrates's logic, what are the logical opposites of all those terms in Socrates's PRINCIPLE.<br>  <br>  PRINCIPLE:<br>  It is always worst to commit than suffer an injustice.<br>  <br>  They are:<br>  <br>  (1) IT IS... vs. IT IS NOT...<br>  <br>  (2) ALWAYS... vs. NEVER vs. SOMETIMES<br>  <br>  (3) WORSE... vs. BETTER vs. SAME<br>  <br>  (4) TO COMMIT... vs. TO NOT COMMIT<br>  <br>  (5) THAN TO SUFFER... vs. THAN TO NOT SUFFER vs. THAN TO PERPETRATE vs. THAN TO NOT PERPETRATE<br>  <br>  (6) AN INJUSTICE ... vs. A JUSTICE (or a just act).<br>  <br>  Start "thinking" those logical opposites and try to make them seem reasonable to YOURSELF for that is the essential ground of a self evident proposition --- the inability to believe or accept its logical opposite as believable, rational or justifiable.<br>  <br>  There are 2 sorts of logical opposites to any given proposition, which are its contrary logical opposite and its contradictory logical opposite.<br>  <br>  A complex sentence, which expresses a simple 1st Principle is always difficult to grasp in a single go.  But if you simplify complex propositions, which is exactly what Socrates does, with each of Gorgias, Polus and Callicles, in Plato's Gorgias, it becomes easier.<br>  <br>  TAKE SIMPLE CONTRARY PROPOSITIONS:<br>  eg. EVERY unjust man is good.  vs. NO unjust man is good.<br>  <br>  Which do you believe?<br>  <br>  eg. EVERY victim of injustice is good.  NO victim of injustice is good.<br>  <br>  and the respective contradictions thereof<br>  <br>  eg. SOME victim of injustice is good   SOME victim of injustice is bad.<br>  <br>  Socrates worked with the above sort of sentential or propositional logic and he was a master at simple propositional logic.  It arguably wasn't until Aristotle explained the simple principles of logic that the so-called Platonic or Socratic aporias began to be resolved at both the Academy and the Lyceum.<br>  <br>  Aristotle put all the axioms of mathematics, physics, philosophy, logic and grammar down to one axiomatic 1st principle, stated in every treatise he ever wrote, but most thoroughly explained and defended in The METAPHYSICS down to one self-evident 1st Principle, which is either grasped or not:-<br>  <br>  The same attribute cannot, at the same time, belong and not belong to the same subject in the same respect.<br>  <br>  So, final question:-  Do you believe that you become evil by suffering evil or do you believe that you become evil by doing evil?<br>  <br>  Socrates thought that it was by doing evil that people become evil and that they can never become evil by merely suffering evil.<br>  <br>  Ergo:- It is always worse to commit injustice than to suffer injustice.<br>  <br>  Kevin

AA10729675	Very similar: both advanced, both preoccupied by the gods, by astrology and calendars, both with laws, both with traditions, both with water (the Nile for Egypt, the Tigris and the Euphrates for Mesopotamia), both having their economy import export under control, both having agriculture and artisans working at making tools, clothes, both having achieved the state of luxury and high degree in architecture, having slaves like every population and country at the time.<br>  However, a big distinction is the following: the Egyptians were happy people.  For them when they died, there was something else, and after life.  The Nile was pretty much regular in the rising of the water and then in the dry season.  They were geographically isolated and protected by the delta and a difficult access from the sea.<br>  The Mesopotamians were extremely desperate.  When they died, there was nothing.  They viewed their lives as just a period of hard work for nothing.  So, they were looking at the stars in the sky more so than the Egyptians and they became the first astronomers in History.  They had a code of law, even before Hammurabi.  Hammurabi just embellished and arranged the ones there were before him.  Their rivers were not so dependable as the Nile and they were never sure if there would be a good season or not, much water or not.  I guess they are the first ones to develop trenches to bring water on their fields from the rivers.  They were very talented because of their desperation about their having no after life.|`|30rd98Ylaa	Similarities: Developed civilization about the same time (3100 BCE).<br>  Developed writing systems, towns with skilled workers, agriculture and irrigation, religion (gods), traded with others, social hierarchy, division of labor, astronomy to predict seasons, settled along rivers ....<br>  Differences: pharoahs were gods not priests as in Mesopotamia, Egypt was protected by natural boundaries on all sides, Mesopotamia was vulnerable to invaders, Egyptian civilization lasted 3000 years, Mesopotamia lasted until the Persians took over, pyramids as tombs, Egyptians had one female pharoah, Egyptian gods were depicted as part animal, Egyptians did not need an army....|`|AA11402617	The two civilizations both grew up along rivers and around the same time period.  It is thought that writing was invented in Mesopotamia, and developed in Egypt probably by trade iwhich started early in the history of both countries.  <br>  <br>  The Nile valley was a strip of tremendously futile and managed farm land that stretch for 500 miles.  The valley of the Tigris and Euphrates also was a futile area but involving two rivers to insure a huge surplus of food making possible the development of service industries within the population because with the abundance came the ability to feed an ever increasing population.  A population that no longer had to labor in agriculture for their livelihood.  Both civilizations worshiped many Gods, but their religions developed very differently.  <br>  <br>  Water was everything.  The egyptian idea of creation starts with "Kemmet" * emerging from a watery void or an existence of only water. and the first bit of land that rose up from the waters is celebrated in a object of sculpture called the ben ben stone. A small squat obelisk. <br>  <br>  The people of the great city of Ur hundreds of miles to the east, seemed less absorbed with death and afterlife than their Nile neighbors, but they built large temples to their Gods as well,  The zigarat style temple greatly resembles the stepped pyramid of Djozer in Egypt, but seemed to serve and entirely different purpose.  They were temples rather than tombs.
qdlmy4l8aa	This is one of my favorites:<br>  <br>  " I was parked in front of the church cleaning out my Jeep.  I was waiting on someone.<br>  <br>  Coming my way from across the street was what society would consider a bum.  From the looks of him, he had no car, no home, no clean clothes, and no money.  There are times when you feel generous but there are other times <br>  that you just don't want to be bothered.  This was one of those 'don't want to be bothered times.'<br>  <br>  'I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,' I thought.<br>  <br>  He didn't.  He came and sat on the wall in front of the bus stop to wait on the bus.  After a few minutes he spoke.<br>  <br>  'That's a very pretty Jeep,' he said.<br>  <br>  He was ragged but he had an air of dignity around him. His scraggly blond beard keep more than his face warm. I said, 'thanks,' and continued cleaning out the Jeep.  He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected plea for money <br>  never came.<br>  <br>  As the silence between us widened something inside said, 'ask him if he needs any help.'  I was sure that he would say 'yes' but I held true to the inner voice.<br>  <br>  'Do you need any help?' I asked.<br>  <br>  He answered in three simple but profound words that I shall never forget.  We often look for wisdom in great men and women. We expect it from those of higher learning and accomplishments. I expected nothing but an outstretched grimy hand. <br>  <br>  He spoke the three words that shook me:<br>  <br>  'Don't we all?'"|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	I agree as well with A Clockwork Apple's answer.  <br>  <br>  I have nothing to add either.|`|Y96jpGe2aa	maybe check out Marc Allen's book on Indigenous Wisdom. A book on short stories by simple people from traditional places and how they view life.<br>  <br>  A story I remember from the book was an old woman from Africa had a daughter that was educated and moved in to the city.  According to the mom, the daughter had a labor-saving device that did her laundry (washing machine) and dishes (dish washer) and she goes around traveling on her walking saving device (which is a car).  The mom suddenly became curious that all of the device did was to save labor but her daughter suddenly had less more time for her family and for herself.<br>  <br>  I hope this  helps.|`|T2UjNRDaaa	look for poetry, LOTS of deeper messages in there.<br>  also a film called "Peaceful Warrior" is focuses on philosophy very similar to your example, i would reccomend you watch it for quotes.|`|cYKYzuJgaa	I wanted to answer this question, but after reading Clockwork Apple's post, I simply cannot say anything.|`|MBa3xMcWaa	awesome quote!!!<br>  here is another one<br>  it is so simple to be happy, but it is so difficult to be simple!
bocePfyYaa	What most everyone has said is true for the most part. You might get lucky and find a DSLR used for under $300. But you can't get one new for that much. You might be able to get a digital camera that is SLR-like. They have manual controls but you can't interchange the lenses.<br>  <br>  I don't know if I would buy a used digital SLR through ebay. Very risky. But you can get a nice one through craigslist and check it out before you buy it. B&H and adorama are very respected dealers and they both have used sections on their websites.<br>  <br>  Now, if you check out B&H, you can get a NEW Sony a200 DSLR with one lens for $500 or with two lenses for $550. That is just about the lowest price you are going to find for a good DSLR that is new from a respectable dealer. If you can get the extra $200, you won't be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Look at the first DSLR as a stepping stone. You buy the camera body and a lens (or two) to start. As you go, you will get more lenses and other accessories-flash, tripod, etc. After two to three years you will probably be ready to upgrade. At that point, you already have money invested in the brand so you just have to get a new camera body and you can still use all the other equipment you have, including the original body as a back-up if you like. So a lot of research is in order to choose a brand now. Otherwise you will have to sell everything at less than what you paid for it and start over.<br>  <br>  BTW-You don't have to have a flash to get good pictures at night. You have to understand aperture and shutter speed and how to use them. For instance, a flash will do nothing good for shooting the sky or the moon or a landscape at night. And with people it will just cause red-eye. Long shutter speeds at higher ISO with smaller apertures will allow you to get those night shots. You have to have some manual settings such as aperture or shutter priority. Full manual mode is even better.<br>  <br>  Now, there is another option. You could pick up a really nice 35mm SLR with lenses for $300. I am talking a semi-pro level camera loaded with features as opposed to an entry level DSLR which you can hardly get for the same money. With canon that would be an elan model. Or with Minolta (synonomous with Sony) a maxxum 7. I don't know about Nikons models. If you get one with a current lens mount, you can use the lenses you get on the DSLRs and vice versa. <br>  <br>  And Hugh-I gave you a thumbs up because you definitely are arrogant so you are just the person the op is talking to ;)|`|D9x1QSgiaa	With a $300 budget you are confined to purchasing a "Point N' Shoot" style of digital camera. It may have a zoom on it...but certainly nothing exceptional. If you wanted one with removeable lenses (Single Lens Reflex) you are going to have to more than DOUBLE your budget. Both Nikon and Canon offer exceptional digital cameras in the $700-900. range.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	for 300 bucks you are not going to get exceptional night shots, because the point and shoot cameras in this price range have very small sensors and are not very sensitive to light. A point and shoot camera may advertise that is has great night shot capabilities and can shoot at ISO 800 or higher, but in reality the quality will be crap.<br>  <br>  If you really want great night shots, be prepared to spend a little bit more and go for a nikon 40D or a canon rebel XT  digital SLR camera.|`|LVpyaf48aa	canon 880<br>  not a great camera but th best you will get for only $300<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Hugh gets a thumbs down from me because he is so "arrogent". lol|`|2bVxBCgzaa	First off, you misspelled 'arrogant'.<br>  <br>  And secondly, buy yourself a Panasonic FZ 18- up to one minute exposure.

Yet the reason you give for not going to the funeral is because of her outer looks. It seems to me that we go to funerals to pay last respects to them, not get a look at a pretty corpse for ourselves. But maybe thats just me.<br>  Still, your final line becomes ironic. When you say "I couldn't stand to see you the way you weren't"; but after all, that is the way that you always saw her because she didn't care about the outside as much as you do.

lPxVt2XYaa	Stalin did not lie about what people were allowed to draw, paint, sculpt, film or write about.  What he did was, in 1932, set out the style that was approved - socialist realism.  Artists, writers etc were paid by the state, writer's works had to be cleared by the censors to ensure that they conformed to the official style - if not they simply refused to allow them to be published - sometimes Stalin himself acted as the censor - he had been a poet of note in Georgia before the revolution, and liked to read Georgian poetry.  <br>  Artists that couldn't work within the new framework were also refused money and exhibition space for their works. Some, like Rodchenko, managed to walk the line between approval and censorship - he focused on photography after 1932, but still managed to cause a furore for some of his works - like Pioneer Girl.  Others, such as El Lissitsky, found their commissions drying up until they adopted the official style.  Others, notably Kandinsky, moved abroad whilst others - such as the brilliant poet Mayakovsky committed suicide in despair.<br>  See:<br>  Art Under Stalin - Matthew Cullerne Bown<br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3671028/Alexander-Rodchenko-A-man-who-took-life-lying-down.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3...</a>

Conflict uses a lot of energy so use the evasion, escapism, and making things up when you need to.<br>  <br>  Take a LOT of breaks, vacations, rests, recuperative time, recovery time.  Extroverts and left brainers can feel like swarms of locust for right brain introverts.  It can feel like you are depleted constantly.<br>  <br>  If possible, get a job where you have control over your environment.  For right-brainers, our environments can be real energy drainers or can be very replenishing.  If you can start your own business, doing something you love where you have control over the kind of energy you use, that would be best for you.<br>  <br>  Don't let people peck you to death.  Maya Angelou tells this story about how, here you are, this person, fairly easy to get along with and there is someone(s) who are like  little chickens pecking at you.  It doesn't hurt.  It's sort of just a little nagging thing that you hardly notice.<br>  <br>  But it continues day in and day out, this pecking.  And before you know it, s/he/they have pecked all of your pieces off and it was done so softly you weren't even very aware of it.<br>  <br>  YOU are the ONLY person in this world who will truly protect you for the rest of your life.  It is your responsibility because if you leave it to someone else, I promise you, it will not get done.<br>  <br>  So in whatever way you have to, not neccessarily combatively or in-your-face, learn to create boundaries, learn you limitations and put a stop to things well inside them.  Don't wait til people are knocking down your fortress.<br>  <br>  Also, go to Amazon.com and look for books on Sensitive People.  Read as much as you can because these books have a wealth of good information that is very very helpful.<br>  <br>  Remember that America is very left-brained.  There are places in the world where your way of thinking would be the norm and you would feel at ease around people who  were more like you.<br>  <br>  Also remember that there are communities within the larger community full of people like you.  You just need to find them.  Then, at least, you have breathers, being with people who will better understand you and with whom you can better relate.|`|cYKYzuJgaa	I'm a artistic and logical mix. It has done me well. I see people who love expressing themselves all their life, whether it be in art, literature etc.<br>  I have also seen people absorbed into joy by simple numbers, patterns, and the pursuit of knowledge.<br>  I cannot truly specialize in either, because I sacrifice for some gains. You sacrifice something too for your intelligence, but never forget you also acquired something also. Enjoy what you have, because it would be rather difficult to make such a life altering change.

The Congress took the view that while it opposed fascism, it could render no support to the British either: there was little to choose between the totalitarianism of the Nazis and the colonialism of the British. It was not with the consent of the Indian people that India was dragged into the war, nor was this India's war; moreover, the Congress expected, but could not procure, an unconditional offer of British withdrawal from India as a condition of its support. Consequently, neutrality was the official policy of the Congress. In an effort to bring the British to the negotiating table, Gandhi launched his 'Quit India' movement in August 1942, and issued from a large meeting ground in Bombay (since re-named August Kranti [revolution] Maidan) the famous call to 'do or die': Indians were to wage one last struggle to achieve independence, or die in that attempt. Elaborate plans were made to offer non-violent resistance; however, almost the entire Congress leadership, and not merely at the national level, was put into confinement less than twenty-four hours after Gandhi's speech, and the greater number of the Congress leaders were to spend the rest of the war in jail.<br>  <br>  T he 'Quit India' movement was followed, nonetheless, by large-scale violence directed at railway stations, telegraph offices, government buildings, and other emblems and institutions of colonial rule. There were widespread acts of sabotage, and the government held Gandhi responsible for these acts of violence, suggesting that they were a deliberate act of Congress policy. Gandhi resolutely denied these charges, but the deadlock was not to be resolved. It has been suggested by other scholars that though Gandhi himself did not authorize violence, he had grown skeptical of the efficacy of non-violence, and that he had arrived at the point in his life where he was determined to see India attain independence during his lifetime. However attractive this line of reasoning might appear, it has little support in Gandhi's voluminous writings. Others have suggested that the 'Quit India' movement was a failure in that it invited the government to unleash repression, and therefore led to the incarceration of the Congress leadership. Consequently, it has been argued, the Muslim League, which declared its support to the British, was to grow in strength during the war, while the Congress languished. Though the Muslim League failed to secure support even among Muslim voters before the war, elections in 1946 suggested that it had the loyalty of the majority of Muslims in many Muslim-dominant areas. On these lines, then, it is suggested that the 'Pakistan movement' developed when there were no countervailing forces to check it, and that Gandhi played into the hands of both Muslim communalists and British imperialists. The 'Quit India' movement remains, in any event, among the most controversial episodes in Gandhi's life and modern Indian history.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	That's the year we really got involved in the war - more full force, and started making progress.

It could be more interesting if the connection is not immediately obvious, or even seems opposite in some way.  I had to name some collages recently.

But if you want to "flesh out" the characters a bit more, you might want to leaven the inner monologue and dialogue with a bit more description of what these people look like, the surroundings in which their verbal exchanges are taking place and so on and so forth. You have a nice "eye" for internal monologue and external dialogue though, and a nice penchant for the psychological inner workings of your characters.

qeLeCQlyaa	You can use acrylic paint for that, somewhat thinned out.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest doing some normal size drawings first.  Then when you get something you like, scale it up to the size it needs to be.  You do that by drawing a graph over the smaller drawing, with, say, one square inch in the graph equalling one square foot on the real thing.  Then you draw a large graph on the sheets and just enlarge the portions in each square, taking what appears in the one inch squares of the small drawing, and making them one foot squares in the large graph.  <br>  <br>  Hope that's clear.  Could not find a good example on line.

AA11649913	My boyfriend is like that kid at school.  He is constantly putting down the series because he believes that it is childish.  <br>  <br>  But he is wrong.<br>  <br>  My Anglo Saxon Professor at UC Berkeley keeps a copy of the first book (of course it is in Latin) in her bookshelf at school.  My Medieval Lit  Prof. gave us his detailed account of what he believes was the inspiration behind the stories.  It has been compared to the story of Jesus at the same time it was accused of promoting witchcraft.  <br>  <br>  Some people put down what they don't understand.  I say - let them, and the outstanding nature that is JK Rowling's books be enjoyed by those who can appreciate it,|`|pOEH4HLuaa	yes, i agree with you.<br>  the reason i don't like it is simply because im stupid and there is way to much going on at the same time and to many characters and ahhhh! its a very very good story though, and i don't know who thought it wouldn't last throughout the ages because it will since its a book that goes for any age group 0-99. everyone reads and loves it. <br>  <br>  twilight was a great book, but it is catered for girls and some moms liked it (probably divorced & single or hopeless romantics). if you haven't noticed most of the twilight fanbases is a whole bunch of screaming superficial teenage girls who i have no utter clue what twilight is other that theres some hot guy named edward. and hollywood turned the movie into a romantic comedy it barely touched the book, it was crap, and i think it was the screenwriters fault. <br>  but in other words twilight is like <br>  confessions of a shopaholic-the book is old but there making a movie, at my local library there are over 433 holds confessions-and its about a girl who shops i read it and its very boring <br>  most people like it cause its in.  it will wear off shopping is nothing big<br>  but harry potter growns with you, hes a little boy becoming an adult an young readers can grown with him!<br>  harry potter is something everyone can appreciate and enjoy no matter what.<br>  <br>  ps. at church the dude said it was witchcraft and my parents said i shouldn't read it, but i did anyways not like they cared. very boring..|`|gH6Ttoz8aa	The people that say that Harry Potter is stupid are people that have never read it or don't know what literature actually is.<br>  Most likely both.|`|bQ9JN7KIaa	the book series of harry potter kicks ***, that kid is just an artard and deserves to get thrown off a cliff. What isnt so great are the movies, which are childish and are prabably more suited for a young audience. I found them to be quite cheesy. I like cheese though hmmmm.|`|owHmOhaNaa	Overrated, or highly recommended books often get bashed by people who dislike it. Harry Potter wasn't wonderful literature, and although Rowling was a good storyteller, her characters aren't completely well rounded. So it stands to reason that she will have a few critics, especially since her books are highly recommended by the teen world. Beside literature critics, she also has neoconservatives howling for her blood, since her books have 'witchcraft' in them. (Which is ridiculous, since she's an atheist). <br>  Just for the record, though, I am not at all a fan of Rowling's. I am particularly skeptical of modern fantasy, since it seems to just be living off the popularity that followed Lewis and Tolkien, the creators of 20th century fantasy.
1hvrQYWiaa	Definitely Great Britain.<br>   Firstly,without British involvement, Paris would almost certainly have been captured and France defeated in the first 2 months of the war; Germany would then have been able to move her army to the Eastern Front.The war would have been over in less than a year.<br>   Secondly, operations against the Turks in the Middle East were carried out almost exclusively by British Empire forces; without British military action, the Ottoman Empire would almost certainly have survived the war.<br>   Thirdly, British aid through Persia in terms of finance and supplies kept Russia in the war long enough for the population to become so angry with the Czar and so war weary that the Bolsheviks were able to seize power.Without British help, the war would have been over much quicker;although Russia would have been on the losing side, there would have been no war weariness and therefore no Russian revolution.<br>   Finally, Germany was ultimately defeated because her army was starved of resources and her people of food by the British naval blockade, which prevented all imports to Germany.No Britain in WW1, no naval blockade.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	The USA.   America's entry assured the victory of the Allies.|`|7f7aa0ea5dc924471fffd54e742f67ddaa	Without a doubt Great Britain had a great impact on the outcome of World War I, but then so did Russia.|`|swlqQ1mYaa	I'd say the US.<br>  <br>  France and Britain were stuck fighting the war since the fall of 1914. But, as documented, they weren't doing such a good job of defeating Germany as they thought they could have done. The British were too cautious in using their Grand Fleet to strike a decisive naval blow. The French were having problems just holding onto the half of their country they had salvaged.<br>  <br>  In the end, because World War I was a war of attrition aimed at wearing down opponents' resources, manpower, and will, the US became very important. Once they entered the war, they cut off supplies to Germany, worsening the situation caused by the blockade. Also, as a large country that only started fighting in 1918 (technically they had been part of it since 1917 but they were very slow in joining the front), the country had a lot of untapped resources that could be brought to bear, as well as young men in their prime to fight and a country raring with nationalism or patriotism.<br>  <br>  It is said that the Germans realized their loss once America had really joined the war, because of the difference in production. (Before, the Central Powers had controlled 19% of world production to the Allies' 28%. The USA's entry into the war only widened this gap.) Also, it was with the USA that the Germans negotiated the armistice, which affected how much influence Wilson's Fourteen Points had on the Treaty of Versailles.|`|W3ATWJRNaa	BRITAIN!! France just complained the entire time. Britain actually put effort into the war, and was not concentrated on revenge just a peaceful ending (and appeasement). I believe Britain focused more on the 14 points (is it 14 or 12 or 13? cant remember ) but anyways they attacked things from a diplomatic stand point. And they suffered for it , not as much as france but still.<br>  Think of it this way, if Britian had not been in the war as much could france have fought it (basically ) alone ?<br>  And vice versa .<br>  Hope i helped!
ffaH5Oz2aa	"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States"<br>  <br>  This gives them, as it says, the ability to tax the people to pay for the costs of running the country, aka military and public services.  If you know anything about the "guns and butter" concept then you will get the idea of what the taxes pay for.<br>  <br>  Okay there is a lot to this section.  In a nut shell, they can borrow from other nations, create trade regulations, create post offices, make roads, create money, give money for the improvement of science and technology, declare war, maintain an army, ect.... <br>  <br>  As for powers needed for a strong nation:  the ability to tax is huge, with no money nothing can get done and people dont willingly give up their money to the government.  the most important power, however, is the power that limits the power of the other branches of government.  This known as checks and balances.  This a key concept, because it is basically saying the most important power is to have limited power.  This keeps things rolling in the direction for the greater good of the country, not a select few.  We fought a war over this: Revolutionary War.  Keeping the government from interfering in the nation's market is also a result from this.  The US is a free market system, and all wars are fought protecting this system:  Revolutionay War, Civil War, World War I, II, vietnam, korean, cold war, and now the war on terror.  Protecting the right to make sure the government oversees but does not control the country.  Limited power is the congresses best power.

Death as society defines it is a ceasing of body function, including heart rate and brain waves.  But that totally ignores spiritual life, which says that death is really a re-birth into another life.  That is how I define death - death is really rebirth...it is a transformation once again, from the world of illusion (this world) into the world of reality (the spiritual world).  I believe we are spiritual beings having an earthly (body) experience.  When we are born here, it is merely a death on the other side getting put into this body we have.  The cycle goes on and on and on...lifetime after lifetime provided that the soul desires rebirth.  So I believe in reincarnation.  But unlike the Hindu's and Buddhists who believe that reincarnation is caused by karma, I don't believe in karma - I believe it is strictly a matter of choice, not inevitable because we are forced to do so in order to balance some kind of cosmic equation of suffering and retribution.<br>  <br>  Death is therefore, a transition, not an end.  A transition which usually, but not always, results in a birth.  Not always, because we do not always return here for yet another lifetime.<br>  <br>  At some point along our spiritual path, we decide that we have had enough and we move on into eternity.  At some point, we regain so much of our memory of who and what we are, we develop to such a fine level of spiritual evolution, that only a very small handful of such advanced spiritual beings return here - usually for the purpose of transforming the world - such people as Jesus or Buddha, or Mohammad, or Gandhi.  These were highly evolved souls who came to know who and what they are and decided to share those insights with the human race to raise us up from barbarian levels...to provide us with an avenue of returning to our rightful mind about who and what we are.<br>  <br>  Death is not a curse, it is the chance to begin anew again, to release the old and return back to a perfect existence where there is no negativity, no illness, no aging, no injustice, no suffering, no need or requirment - only perfect happiness, contentment and peace, and most of all LOVE.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Death is separation.

NYU37jfGaa	In 'Life in Ancient Egypt' , Eugene Strouhal writes:<br>  <br>  'In the course of the New Kingdom feminine fashion became even more varied and sophisticated.  White remained the most popular colour, only occasionally varied with pastel shades, but dresses were now made of two pieces or more.  The outer garments were sometimes smooth, sometimes pleated, made from the finest linen with short sleeves and either pinned together over the bust or tied in decorative folds.  They were sheer enough to show off feminine curves, but in fact most ladies still wore the tradtional tunic underneath.  This was also in many cases diaphanous and skin-tight.<br>  <br>  The outer garment varied in length and had narrow lengthiswe pleats with fan-pleating at the shoulders or cross-folds on the sleeves.  It was modestly trimmed with coloured braid, ribbons edging and other embellishemtns.  The neckline was eigher deep and wide, or narrow, converging down to the waist.  Some dresses covered only one shoulder, the other shoulder and breast remaining bare, except when concealed behind a light veil or the edge of wrap or cloak.<br>  <br>  The shoulder-wrap or hip length cloak ended in a fringe tied into little knots.  Feminine clothing was bvecoming subtler and unquestionably sexy during this period.<br>  <br>  Under the New Kingdom and later, upper-class women wore not only bracelets at the wrist but metal bangles round the upper arm, with cloisons for inlays of semi-precious stones or coloured glass.  On ceremonial occasions aristocrats wore leather or textile sashes decorated with meshes of beads, fastened in front with an ornamental clasp.<br>  <br>  Coronets or diadems were worn in higher circles, with petals round the side and a lotus blossom in front.  Among the very rich these were made of wire or metal strips with ornamental details welded on, notably rosettes for setting gemstones in.  Both women and upper-class men wore rings, the cheaper ones of faience, the finer sort of gold and silver.

2Ko12Elfaa	...it's an allegory.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	Notice, first of all, that he isn't saying that this situation exists anywhere, but that it is an IMAGE to help us understand what our human situation is like in its EDUCATION and IGNORANCE. That is why Glaucon was smart enough not to ask those questions above. It is the relationship between the image and what goes on in the soul that Socrates is concerned with, not the details you mention. If you want a good interpretation of the cave allegory that makes good sense, read Heidegger's in his book "On the Essence of Truth".|`|Xxviy63Paa	The Allegory of the Cave is one of the biggest loads of crap in all of philosophy, and that's saying a lot. It's even dumber than Anselm's proof of the existence of god.<br>  <br>  And you are right: Let a coffee-shop type like Socrates hypnotise you with his endless babble, and you forget to ask those obvious questions, instead just listening like a child at storytime while Plato messes your mind.<br>  <br>  This is what Plato is doing:<br>  <br>  1) Painting you a picture of people who are absurdly repressed <br>  <br>  2) saying that if you then let them go, they'll be more used to the repressed experiences you forced on them before, and resist being let go<br>  <br>  3) saying that philosophers are better than them, and are the "heros" who set them free<br>  <br>  4) saying that only philosophers - rich, well-paid, pampered ones, that is - have any valid experience of reality. ****<br>  <br>  Besides asking Socrates how the hell those poor people got into that miserable situation, you should also ask where in the world anything like that has actually happened. Because that's the trick Plato plays: making you assume that philosophers are so brilliantly enlightened, that everyone else is dumber than a rock like the allegory in the cave. That's no idle arrogance on Plato's part. It was the foundation of his entire lifestyle and the basis for political decisions, invasions, mass killings. It was based on the Greek aristocratic institution of slavery. Not to mention sodomizing children as an accepted way of life. <br>  <br>  Of course a man like Plato is going to try to tell you "I know everything and you're stupid." Because he would sound cocky if he said it straight up, he says it as a "dialog" between Socrates and someone who, for one reason or another, had no brains to question Socrates with. He has Socrates demean the experience of the "regular" person, then paints the philosopher as the one who lets them look at other things. He tries to use logically bad implication to make you accept the allegory, by comparing the way the people would react to "seeing the light" to the way people react when they're argued with; i.e., getting angry and wanting to go back to what they know. This implication is logically unsound, of course, because people still get angry if you try to "show them the light" when you're full of crap.<br>  <br>    Moreover, why accept that the people in the allegory would react angrily or fearfully to seeing the real world? In a situation like that, the people would certainly still know they were people. They would also be hell of uncomfortable. Their joints would ache terribly. They would have enough peripheral vision to know there was something else besides the shadows. It's more reasonable to expect the one who's unshackled to be relieved or grateful. Fearful, maybe. Angry, no, not unless you threaten them. <br>  <br>    Most people by gut instinct are angry when someone tries to mislead them. And there are plenty of people who do mislead, including philosophers, especially bad elitist ones like Plato. Not about someone "setting them free" or showing them the light. The allegory of the cave tries to confuse one with the other using Plato's favorite mind-numbing trick, the imaginary conversation. You're right to question it, but you should do more than question it, consign it to history with the rest of Plato. It's got no place in the modern world.<br>  <br>  **** I don't feel like editing this long answer much so I asterisked the most important part - it is the gist of Plato's astonishing arrogance.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Philosophy goes with time and evolves.

zupJYkngaa	Now this, I can answer!<br>  In elementary, I had to perform at Honolulu Symphony... We had to do this hand motion and sing at the same time, and it was in front of over 100 people! The other one was in school for Christmas. We sang a christmas song (of course... but forgot which) and had to sing in front of over 60 people... <br>  But anyways, back to the point, yes it is hard. If you're not use to people looking at you... and there's A LOT OF THEM, you feel quite embarrassed, but the more you perform on stage, you feel comfortable... Lol think about being in Tina's shoes!<br>  While your singing in front of an audience... and you feel like you have a hard time making the words come out... think about something else, like your a different person. Lol I know your not a big fan of Beyonce but, if you pretend that your someone else... you might not remember who you are while performing!<br>  And like Cher said... she was shy when she was behind the curtains... "I don't know how i did this!" <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps! (sorry it's long)|`|AN02OYPlaa	I don't sing, but I do play the violin which can be just as nerve-racking sometimes. What I recommend would be getting the song as well as you can and practicing often. That way you'll feel more confident in front of the audience. Also, don't focus on the audience. Just focus on singing - not getting the song over with, but just singing. Try staring at a spot on the back wall when you're on stage and singing so you don't meet eyes with anyone, in case that'd make you anxious. Take your time, too. Don't focus on getting it over with, because then you'll just end up rushing. LIke others said, singing in front of a small crowd beforehand should help, too. Have you ever done anything live before? I can tell you this - the first and second times are always the hardest. But relax. Remember that while performing. Best of luck. You have a beautiful voice by the way.|`|KdxTQ6nGaa	it may be a little hard especially if itz ur first time. what my singer friends usually do is that they will choose a public spot with not too many people and just start singing ther hearts out. but they uauslly do it in groups. not too sure whether this will work for you, but good luck!!|`|t9T35AkCaa	its easier if you have someone up there with you...so if you mess up and you can be like, "well, she/he began blah blah blah.."|`|oXRZfAWaaa	get some practice singing in front of people.  it can be terrifying - even if you sing at home / in the studio all the time.  it's different.
IT5tOowEaa	The Capulet and Montague families are mortal enemies, which I gather happened a lot back then.  At a masquerade party (they wore masks) Romeo and Juliet fall in love before realizing who they are; Juliet's a Capulet, Romeo's a Montague.<br>  Anywho, they meet in the garden and decide to get married.  However, Romeo gets in a fight and kills some cousin of Juliet's and is banished from the city.  He is already married to Juliet, but neither family knows it.<br>  He goes to another town and the priest who married them makes a plan so he and Juliet can get together, wink wink.  It involves Juliet pretending to be dead.  The priest sends Romeo a letter, but it doesn't get delivered.  Instead, a Montague servant tells Romeo, who thinks Juliet really is dead.<br>  He buys a fast-acting poison and goes to see Juliet in the Capulet grave.  He cries over her, but she isn't really dead.  She is, however, unconscious.  Romeo drinks his poison and dies.  Juliet wakes up and discovers he's dead, along with the guy she was supposed to marry but didn't.  She takes one of their daggers and kills herself.<br>  The families arrive and somehow figure it all out.  They then go on to say "If only we were friends our kids wouldn't be dead, let's be the best of buds now."<br>  <br>  ...Or something like that.<br>  <br>  What a tragedy. :(|`|d2hrH6EEaa	God I did a speech on this. lol.<br>  <br>  This story begins in medieval italy in the town of verona. It starts with two feuding families, the Montagues and the Capulets, who have been in a family feud for many long years. The heads of each extended family have a child...Juliet Capulet and Romeo Montague. Romeo, disguised under a mask, meets Juliet at a masked ball and it is love at first sight. Soon afterwards they are secretly married. The next day, Romeo slays juliet's cousin Tybalt in a bloody duel and is banished from the city. Juliet is distraught upon hearing this and then finds out that she has been betrothed to Paris, a wealthy country noble.Juliet seeks help from Romeo's friend, the friar who married them. He tells her if she takes a potion it will make her appear dead but she'll only be sleeping. Juliet agrees and goes up to her room where she delivers a long lengthy speech that I gave, then takes the potion. The friar sends word to Romeo of their plan but it never reaches him. instead, he hears from a servant that Juliet Capulet was found dead the morning of her wedding. He rushes back to the city and finds her under the effects of the potion. He believes she is dead and takes a poison and dies next to her. juliet wakes up, sees him dead, and fatally stabs herself. After this the M's and C's make up to each other. Oh and Romeo kills Paris outside Juliet's tomb.|`|crrK58F4aa	2 families hate each other so much that when their children fall in love/lust with each other they devise a plan to stay together which goes horribly wrong and they end up committing suicide, which works as a lesson for the families to stop fighting.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to read the whole play watch the Baz Luhrman Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo Dicapro.|`|Ta7snyIoaa	Girl meets boy. <br>  Boy meets girl.<br>  Girl and boy kiss. <br>  Girl and boy fall in "love".<br>  Girl and boy forbidden.<br>  Boy goes to girl's house. <br>  Boy and girl further there love. <br>  Not allowed. <br>  Girls make a plan with boy. <br>  Boy does not recieve note of said plan. <br>  Boy kills himself. <br>  Girl kills herself. <br>  <br>  <br>  That's basically it.|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	Two  families  arguing  many  years, both  too proud  to  give  in,  adding  more  misunderstanding  and  fueding.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	There's so many things to talk about that I'm not even sure where to start.<br>  <br>  First of all, that Urban Outfitters website is a complete and total rip-off.  They take advantage of people who have absolutely no knowledge or experience in photography (especially film photography) and charge outrageous prices for poor quality TOY cameras.  All of those cameras in the links you gave are "lomography" cameras.  They are considered toy cameras and they're made almost entirely from plastic (including the lens!).  They have problems with light leaks, and soft focusing and color fringing because of the poor quality plastic lens.  Some people like those defects to get interesting effects in their pictures.  And it is POSSIBLE to get interesting and creative effects with a lomography camera.  But you just have to remember that the strange effects are because it's a very poor quality camera.  It might be fun to use that camera, and you might get interesting pictures with the right lighting and with certain subjects.  But don't get your hopes up too high.  That camera WILL take poor quality pictures, because it's a poor quality camera.<br>  <br>  The number you see labeled on a film (sometimes called the "film speed") is the ISO rating.  The ISO rating means how light sensitive the film is.  So, a 400 ISO film is more sensitive than 200 ISO.  A higher ISO film (higher "film speed") means you can take pictures with less light.  But as someone else had explained, there's a catch.  Higher ISO films are more sensitive, but they also tend to be more grainy.  An 800 ISO film is going to give you very grainy pictures and I wouldn't even bother with that.  Especially not with that camera.  It's always best to use a lower ISO film if you can.  I love taking landscape photos, and I like to use 100 ISO film.  That way, I can get very sharp pictures with no grain.  <br>  <br>  200 ISO is a good all-around film to use if you're going to be taking pictures outside on a sunny day.  400 is a good compromise if it might be partly cloudy.  I wouldn't go any higher than 400 ISO.<br>  <br>  Also, there is another catch.  You can't really control the exposure on those lomography cameras.  You can't change the shutter speed, you're stuck with whatever shutter speed the camera was designed for.  So if you use a film that's too high of an ISO, you'll just end up overexposing it.  With a film camera that has manual exposure control, you can change the shutter speed and aperture yourself, to adjust for the lighting conditions.  But you can't do that with those lomography cameras.  So you just have to try to chose the right kind of film that you think you'll need.<br>  <br>  So I would go with 200 ISO, or maybe 400 ISO film at the most.  <br>  <br>  And by the way, what that Urban Outfitters website is trying to charge for film is rediculous!  You can use ANY 35mm film with that camera.  You don't need some kind of special "lomography" film!  Like I said, they're trying to take advantage of people and they're a total rip-off.  You can buy 35mm film anywhere...Walmart, Target, drug stores, grocery stores, and even some gas stations.  Get a 200 or 400 ISO film and you should be ok.  A Kodak or Fuji film would be fine.  You can get them anywhere, and they're very forgiving with exposure.  I can buy a 5-pack of Kodak film at Walmart for about $6 right now...but that Urban Outfitters place is trying to charge $14 for a 3-pack of some generic film!!  Like I said, they're a rip-off and they take advantage of people.  People think lomography is "kewl" or "artisitic" but it's really just a rip-off. <br>  <br>  If you get seriously interested in film photography, then get a REAL manual film camera....like a 35mm SLR or rangefinder camera.|`|WGBWblFxaa	film's iso rating just means it's sensitivity to light. The ISO halves or doubles. So 200 is twice as sensitive as 100.<br>  The other thing you should know is that the higher the ISO number the grainer things get. <br>  You could get an old film slr for cheaper and buy a screw on fish-eye for the lens if it's the effect you want. You can use any ISO you want and you can change the lens to take 'normal' photos.|`|xZtmgNboaa	first of all, you should get a better camera. that one is so expensive...35mm are easy to come by.<br>  thrift stores for sure!<br>  <br>  urban outfitters is starting to sell out it seems =/<br>  <br>  800 speed is what i use, cuz i like it looking grainy. i stole some 800 speed 35mm film from wal mart more than once (I dont support wal mart financially =D)<br>  <br>  ISO=ASA is prety much all i know<br>  <br>  really though you don't need to spend that much money. I have put 50 dollars into photography and i have eight working antique cameras, lots of film, three super eight cameras, and lots of prints. oh and lots of lenses! six, i think. and four flashes.<br>  <br>  granted some of it was low level lifting. but still..urban outfitters is gonna cost you. used to be a lot cooler than it is today.|`|bocePfyYaa	If you really want a lomography camera why not go with the Diana? You can get the diana with a flash for $95. Then you can buy a fisheye lens for it for about $40.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1&navAction=jump&id=14633986&search=true&isProduct=true&parentid=SEARCH+RESULTS&color=00" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1&navAction=jump&id=15499775&search=true&isProduct=true&parentid=SEARCH+RESULTS&color=01" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...</a><br>  <br>  The drawback to the Diana is that it takes 120 film. You can buy it online and in some camera shops. Not a big deal. But most local labs can't process it, and they have to send it out to a different lab. So, it takes a little longer to get your prints back. But 120 film is going to give you better options for enlargements than 35mm film. So there is the upside and the downside.<br>  <br>  edit-problem-I think you have an appropriate name there. Stealing is deplorable. Lousy thieves cause everyone else to have to pay more for the items we buy. I wouldn't be shouting so proudly about being a crimial and a loser.

I love you. You're all sparkly and now we have a mutant child together HORRAY!<br>  OMFG it's just them proliferating their love for each other for 1000+ pages. And right at the end Smeyer is like JESUS CHRIST I NEED PLOT and throws some crap in.<br>  <br>  Ok Edward is not hot. He is a creepy stalker. he watches her sleep. He won't let her see her friends. He follows her around. He won't let her drive. He beats her up while they're having sex. He gives her a c-section with his teeth. Come on that's gross. Bella is disgusting, falling apart as soon as Edward leaves and only getting some semblance of togetherness back when she finds another guy to take Edward's place. PATHETIC.<br>  <br>  It seems only tween girls with half a brain enjoy twilight. Every single one of my friends hates Twilight. Thinks it's absolutely ridiculous, the writing is terrible, the characters one dimensional and the plot cliche. We're 18. My sister, who is 13 is in love with Twilight. So are all her friends. They get together and talk about it and how 'awesome' it is and 'how much they love Edward' and how they 'just wish Jacob would die'. Basically Twilight is aimed for girls 12-16. <br>  <br>  Smeyer writes likes she's swallowed a thesaurus and apparently doesn't know the meaning of Purple Prose. And she repeats the same phrases over and over and over again. Chagrin chagrin chagrin. STFU. Her books are riddled with plot holes and discrepancies. How can Edward, who has been dead for nearly 100 years, have sperm, which is alive, and has the capability to father a child. Yeah makes awesome sense. And how can that child even exist. It's not scientifically possible for someone to have 23 chromosomes. It results in down syndrome. Obviously the stupid mormon doesn't believe in proven scientific fact. Or just doesn't research her books<br>  <br>  Ok and every single character in Twilight is one dimensional. <br>  Bella: Pathetic Mary Sue<br>  Edward: I love you Bella. And the oldest virgin ever<br>  Jacob: annoying.<br>  And that's it. That's all the major characters. If you include like Emmett and Jasper and Alice. They don't even have personalities. Alice is just constantly jumping around "horray i just had a vision that we'll all live happily ever after".The best one, in my opinion is Rosalie. Or Jasper. In that movie he looked constipated the entire time. Did he even say anything?<br>  <br>  I hate the way Bella is supposed to be an average girl, with faults. As far as I can tell her only fault is being "clumsy" which everyone seems to find endearing so isn't really a fault at all. And what's with her supposed to be average looking? yeah ok coz it's not like every guy in the school wants to be in her pants apparently. At my high school all the guys went for the average girl, definitely. She looks basically the same as Stephenie meyer would look. Except 50kg lighter. Lol at her photoshopping her fatness away. But this girl is supposed to be a role model. She completely falls apart when Edward leaves her and only pulls herself back together when she's found another man to replace him. It's pathetic. She has no independence or goals. She just wants to be with Edward forever, regardless of the consequences to herself and everyone around her. <br>  <br>  And EDWARD. Apparently the man of every girls dreams? Why because he's pretty. Hey maybe it's just me but I'd be a bit freaked out if my boyfriend started to sparkle. I love the fact that he hasn't got chisseled abs. I've grown up learning that you love a person for who they are, not what they look like. Yet in relation to love, the only thing that Bella ever describes is Edward's looks. Great example for all the kids out there. You look at his personality and you realise he's a stalker. He follows her around, watches her sleep, won't let her see her friends, won't let her drive. He controls her completely and people find this romantic! During sex he beats her black and blue and again, his regret is seen as romantic. He gives her a c-section with his teeth and again, oh so romantic, I would swoon if this happened to me.<br>  <br>  Stephen King, best selling author for decades said on Twilight and its comparison to Harry Potter: <br>  "The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn," he said. "She's not very good."<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the fifth book<br>  It was called Midnight Sun. It was Twilight from Edward's point of view however It was leaked.

She's been throwing around unfinished drafts like they were confetti, even giving one to the guy who plays Edward in the shitty movie adaption of Twilight so he could "better understand his character." Rpattz most likely leaked the manuscript in retaliation of being stuck playing a character he hates. Someone needs to call the WAAAAHMBULANCE! There is now a Publish Midnight Sun (PMS) Petition full of illiterate aspie fangirls bawwing and begging for Midnight Sun in caps lock.<br>  <br>  <br>  I used to love it. Then I read a few people dissing it here and started to think... hey yeah what they're saying is true. Then I decided to go for my... fifth reread. And it was like I was reading an entirely different book. I could see entirely through the "sparkle". I hope that one day I can inspire someone else to do the same.<br>  <br>  As for recommending you books:<br>  <br>  The Book Thief - Markus Zusak<br>  From the point of view of death in WWII Germany. He follows a girl as she is fostered by an anti-nazi family and as her world falls apart around her.<br>  <br>  Kite Runner - Khalad Hosseini<br>  About two best friends, one fortunate and rich, the other his servant, growing up in 1970's Afghanistan and follows the fortunate boys story through life. It's shocking and beautiful and I loved it. <br>  <br>  The Time Travelers Wife – Audrey Niffeneger <br>  An unconventional love story that centers on a man with a strange genetic disorder which causes him to unpredictably time travel, and his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. I’m generally not much into romance and I loved this.<br>  <br>  The Tomorrow Series - John Marsden (young adult fiction but they're amazing)<br>  A group of teenage that are camping in the Australian bush when Australia is invaded by enemy soldiers. It involves every genre pretty much, adventure, drama, romance, friendship. I have read the series too many times <br>  <br>  Angela's Ashes - Frank McCourt<br>  McCourt's autobiography of his growing up and living in poverty in first New York and then Ireland with an alcoholic father, depressed mother and many many siblings. I cried so hard in this book. <br>  <br>  My Sisters Keeper - Jodie Picoult<br>  One girl had cancer and her parents genetically engineered a genetic match for her. Once the "test tube baby" grows to a teenager she requests medical emancipation so she doesn't have to donate her kidney to her sister. It follows not only her but the entire family as they try and deal with the crisis. I was reluctant to read this, thinking it would be chick lit. But it was beautiful and sad and I loved it <br>  <br>  To Kill A Mockingbird - Harper Lee<br>  Ultimate classic of a girl whose white father, an apparently lone non-racist, defends a black man obviously wrongly accused of murder<br>  <br>  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - Ken Kesey<br>  Another classic. A psychiatric institution that is turned on its head by McMurphy, a man obviously not insane. The manipulative warden Nurse Ratched dictates the ward with shocking consequences.<br>  <br>  Tuesdays With Morrie - Mitch Albom<br>  The true story of Mitch Albom's old professor who is dying and every tuesday, gives Albom a lesson of life. <br>  <br>  The Poisonwood Bible - Barbara Kingslover<br>  A Reverand, his wife and four daughters move to the Congo to try and convert the locals to christianity. The point of view of all the daughters allows us to see how they grow and mature and learn that their father is not all controlling.<br>  <br>  The Obernewtyn Chronicles - Isobelle Carmody<br>  A post-apocalyptic world ruled by a dictatorship of a government. Some people begin to show signs of advanced mental abilities (read others minds, have visions of the future etc) and are burned or taken to "farms" which inevitably mean death. One of these "misfits" is caught and we follows her awesome journey<br>  <br>  Life of Pi – Yann Martel<br>  In this story, the protagonist Piscine "Pi" Patel, an Indian boy, is shipwrecked and stuck on a small boat with a tiger, hyena, orangutan and zebra. It’s a riveting story of how he survives for over 200 days.|`|CecQFtDvaa	yes i have read them all <br>  my friend read them all and she cant stand them she even leaves when anyone starts talking about twilight (haha my fav way to annoy her =P)<br>  stephanie meyer is not going to finish midnight sun or the 5th book becuase someone illegally posted it on the internet before it was finished if you want to know more you can look at her website also on her website are the first 12 chapters of midnight sun<br>  midnight sun is twilight only in edwards point of veiw <br>  hope this helped<br>  xoxo<br>  byee :]|`|XZBJNwi1aa	Obviously you haven't talked with many English majors or even spent much time on this board "Have you met anyone that has read Twilight and not loved it" Actually a lot of people I know don't like them, and I'm not particularly fond of them either.  Twilight is a battle ground of people who love and hate it.<br>  <br>  Bella's story is done.  There is no fifth book in that story.  Meyer started a parallel novel called Midnight Sun; however an illegal copy was leaked (12 chapters).  No one (even Meyer) knows if she will finish it.<br>  <br>  additional note:<br>  since you liked twilight you might like some of these<br>  Wicked Lovely by Marr<br>  Vampire Academy by Mead<br>  Glass Houses by Caine<br>  Marked by Cast<br>  Evernight by Gray<br>  Hunger Games by Collins<br>  Graceling by Cashore|`|cdgm85A6aa	Like Alex I used to like Twilight but I have since come to my senses and opened my eyes to it's many flaws (which Alex has so eloquently described in that award winning rant).<br>  <br>  Don't get me started on Breaking Dawn!! Here is a fantastic recap of what exactly went down in that book: <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/lion_lamb/1651773.html?page=1#comments" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/lion_la...</a><br>  <br>  I am not saying you shouldn't love Twilight - if it is your type of book then good for you! But also think back to when you were opposed to the books and understand that there are still people out there who feel that way about them.<br>  <br>  I recommend 'The Lovely Bones' by Alice Sebold. It has received wonderful reviews and is also being made into a film. I just started reading it today and from the first page I was engaged in the book! I'm off to continue reading it now =D|`|i1gesbh5aa	....I am too stunned by Alex to answer.  Actually, look at Alex's answer if you want my answer.  Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.<br>  <br>  I have read the first three books and thought they were terrible.|`|6C24kJhaaa	well it seems alot of girls esp 8-17 like it. not guys so yeah. and people with good taste lol jk i respect your "cute vampire" novels|`|N0YH5RRuaa	My friend tried reading it, but she didn't like it. She didn't finish the first book.<br>  I loved it.|`|2WbR3IvFaa	In the world? How many books have you read? Simple minded people I swear.|`|wnIUyaMMaa	I read Twilight and I loved it too.. for about three hours after finishing it. And I think after you get over how hot and perfect Edward is then you will see all of the flaws and the non existent plot. Here's basically a summary of the first book (only one i read)<br>  <br>  BELLA: Eww.. Forks is cold and gross and I'm going to spend half of the book complaining about it even though I was the one who decided to come here. I will also not respect or appreciate my dad who I will call Charlie, even though he is doing all he can to make me feel welcome.<br>  <br>  GUYS AT SCHOOL: Hi there! You must be Isabella, we are going to be over-helpful to you because we have all for some reason fallen in love with your Mary-Sue-ness.<br>  <br>  *after some meaningless chapters of something*<br>  <br>  BELLA: I love you Edward!<br>  <br>  EDWARD: No! You must stay away from me because I'm dangerous and you smell good.<br>  <br>  *some forced suspense happens*<br>  <br>  BELLA: I love you Edward!<br>  <br>  EDWARD: I love you too. But you must stay away from me because I'm dangerous and you smell good.<br>  <br>  THE END|`|AN02OYPlaa	I loved it at first...now looking back, I honestly think it's bad. I'm sorry. To me, the writing's very bland, the characters are 2D (can you honestly say any of them are very complex? If not, 2D), and the plot can be pretty boring at times. Breaking Dawn was just an absolute mess, even back when I loved the rest of the series. <br>  Anyway, there will be no fifth book. Stephenie said something about possibly writing books about Renesmee and Jacob, but I believe she's taking a break from Twilight for a while, with the whole Midnight Sun incident.|`|9Y04eUIdaa	Hi! I'm Jenny. Now you know someone who read the 4 books and not love it. I'm not going to tell you why I don't like it but I will tell you that I love Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Tom Clancy. I absolutely love watching movies (like the Underworld series).<br>  It's probably because I am a little old for the Twilight Series whose market is the teen group (I'm in my mid 30's).<br>  To each his (or her) own....|`|C2FkuVESaa	HOLY COW ALEX.

tyeCsbk1aa	This is a complicated question that cannot be answered adequately in simple yes/no terms. <br>  <br>  First of all, to get this out of the way, because it is the most obvious:  as an entity or a force, no, evil does not exist. It is a human construct, as subjective as beauty or love. Unless you believe in god. To make things simple, let's say we don't.<br>  <br>  Now, what makes a person evil—by our society's commonly accepted definition of evil, which I will be using for the rest of this answer—that is the complicated part. It may in fact be due to any or all of the things you said: drug abuse, traumatic events, environment—all those things can affect a person's disposition later in life. Like FUHammer, I do not believe there is an "evil" gene; people are not born evil. Now it comes down to how much of what causes someone to commit an evil act is prior conditioning, and how much is choice, and how much each matters. The two overlap; by the very nature of our minds, every decision we make is a result of how our past experiences have shaped us. However, I find it vulgar and impractical to say that this means no one is responsible for their actions. We have free will so long as we think we do. Thus, evil—with the exception of mental illness—is always a choice. <br>  <br>  But back to your question. As an entity, as something real and definite, no. Evil does not exist.<br>  <br>  As a quality we assign to people, as something subjective we made up, yes. It obviously does.|`|329e16bd855db48d292d1afce685f07aaa	It definitely exists. It has been embodied in the people you mentioned. However, I find it hard to believe that when any of the people you mentioned were infants, that they didn't have a chance of growing up to be compassionate, mentally balanced individuals.I've read a bit more about Manson than some of the other people you mentioned and know that he had a pretty horrendous, emotionally deprived childhood. I think it reasonable to believe that his dysfunctional upbringing had a lot to do with the formation of his psychopathological character. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I find it hard to believe that there is an "evil gene" that just exists in some individuals that trumps any other factors in determining their "evil" characters. I find it hard to believe people are just "born bad". <br>  <br>  I'm sure there are some astrologers that believe people are born under negative planetary influences that can cause them to be serial murderers, etc. But I don't know enough about that to comment. <br>  <br>  As far as my belief in the non-existence of an "evil gene", however, I realize that there is a possibility that someday genetic scientists may discover otherwise. Anything is possible.|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Depends on what your definition of evil is. I believe the people you have mentioned were mentally ill.  Not "crazy" but mentally ill.  They are/were sociopaths.  If you understand mental illness from a medical standpoint many of the things these people do are caused by their own illness.  They do not, and cannot rationalize the way we do because their brains are literally different than ours.  Childhood trauma, actual physical trauma, genetics all these things can affect your mind and how it perceives ideas.  A sociopath will not feel remorse.  They lack something most of us have which is compassion.  There are mild and extreme cases of this.  We are only human, some people have problems with their nervous systems.  Others have heart problems.  Often times mental illness is ignored and not treated as you would with any other physical ailment, but it's one of the most important organs you need to take care of- your brain.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm in no way justifying the things these people do.  But there is a reason for it.  Evil....?  I don't know.  We can look at it logically or just call it evil like a religion does and use capital punishment for all who we think deserve it.  Again, nothing against capital punishment, my own cousin was killed last year and there's currently a $50,000 reward here in CA  to get the bastard that did it.  If he got fried, that's ok by me.|`|E3SJNlIUaa	It honestly depends on what your definition of evil is. Many people have different definitions, because they have different moral values, some believe in God others don't. They have different P.O.V. on social topics, and they were brought up differently. I think evil exists, and the things I consider evil might be different from what other people think. It's not the cliche 'you killed someone that's evil,' it's more about everything a human being does can be consider evil in some way.|`|SL69Pzt3aa	evil is a point of view, that's all. there's no such thing as objective evil. evil is relative to good, if there is a lot of good in the world, anything that isn't very good would be termed evil. if everybody was a killer in society, jeffrey dahmer and adolf hitler would be idols.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Yes!  In this workshop called earth it is one the opposites of goodness. Other such examples are  good bad, up down in out and many many thousand of other opposites  Such is a souls adventure here  Souls also play many rolls such as  Hitler and Churchill etc|`|y8cXzvpxaa	evil does exist. while evil may have different faces the general view of evil is the same. same story with good.<br>  <br>  some people just turn cold and ruthless.|`|LNOsY8Jiaa	Yes, it does. Some people are predisposed to be evil. I am sorry, they have been in my life. They can look you in the face and appear to be good people and when the right or wrong signal is sent they will turn on you. This is the truth. Please, be cautious.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Does evil really exist? Yes. And strangely enough, we are the only species on this planet that we know of that observes and practices it. Research rope torture, the pear of anguish, Judas cradle, and water torture. Consider that we are the only species that kills for fun. Consider that we are the only species that exploits our own kind for personal profit.<br>  <br>  And the thumbs down is hilarious. Thanks. I think before you answer this question, you need to think about the literal definition of evil versus good. At its broadest, most basic definition, evil is that which is detrimental to society, and good is what is benificial. Now, that being said, what other species is actually destructive to its own existence? What other species on this planet will actually willingly kill itself?|`|QYPrM3GPaa	In my opinion, evil really does exist in the world.  But that evil is not caused by a devil (Satan/Lucifer/Beelzebub, etc.) or by demons (angels that defied God and went with Lucifer to Hell).  Evil is the product of  a human mind that lacks knowing who and what it really is.  Evil are the acts that result from not knowing who you are.  And, evil serves a fuction...I shall call it, the darkness.  It is the mirror image of the self.<br>  <br>  Evil can only be healed with love, just as the darkness can only be banished with the light.  The most compassionate beings understand far better than most of us do, that evil can be healed with love, not because you love evil itself, but because you love yourself, period.<br>  <br>  Just as all the other dualities in life (good vrs bad, up vrs down, in vrs out, light vrs dark) - each one of these allow us to measure ourselves and therefore define who and what we really are.  How could we know how "good" we are if there was no "bad/evil" to compare it to?  How can we know how grand we really are until we compare it to how small we can be?  Taking the world to the lowest depth of depravity gives us great cause to raise it up to the greatest heights of purity.  Only through our opposites can we define ourselves and know who we truly are.<br>  <br>  So if there are demons or devils involved, it is certainly US who are they and if there are angels involved, it is we who are they as well.  <br>  <br>  I believe there will come a time when all the darkness shall be consumed by the light, and that will happen when all of us fully know who we are, when we no longer need to compare or discover our grandness and our greatness but merely express that in every pour of our BEING.  I believe this is the ultimate goal of the Plan God has for all of us - that moment when the last little spec of darkness contained within us is banished forever and we assume ultimate, total, complete and rightful knowing and BEING of who and what we really are.<br>  <br>  I have to admit, I do not know all the answers, nor even a part of them.  Sometimes, the evil done in this world sickens me to such a depth that I find myself caught up in despair because some of the evil done is so horrific it makes me ill - killing thousand or millions of innocents out of political, religious or economic rivalries or ideologies, depriving whole nations of food left to starve, forcing billions to live in utter destitution with no hope of ever having a better life, a world filled with despair and no hope - I do not understand all of it or why, I do not comprehend the depth of the purpose in all its meanings for evil, only that I have some kind of circumspect concept that says, without evil, we would not know how good, good is.  Why so many have to die and suffer to support that purpose is beyond my comprehension.<br>  <br>  Yes, evil exists.  To deny it exists gives it unbridled power over us.  To admit it exists, means we can do something about it to lessen or curb it or eventually, even vanquish it.   It all depends on how sincere we are as a race of human beings to live in the light rather than tolerate conditions of the darkness as the price we must pay for whatever reason.|`|kKsPYFSgaa	Yes it does but people have different views on evil and i personally think that Hitler was an evil man but there have been more evil people such as Stalin and Manson but people tend to overlook them....but anyways yes EVIL EXISTS.|`|VOccyg7daa	I think evil is alive and well in the world today.  We need look no farther than our nearest newspaper to see it. I also think that those who refuse to recognize this fact well only let it grow.|`|AA10286634	yes.
ji7WZvC1aa	Mix size with the paint (normal paint should be fine) to stop it falling off the backdrop as soon as it's dry.  The other thing which absolutely must be considered is that the sheets need to be fireproofed BEFORE you paint them - you can buy fireproofing spray, and this is absolutely imperative - your teacher should know about this so talk to them about it.  If you have space, build a frame which is big enough to take the whole backdrop and stretch it on it - get a staple-gun and staple the backdrop to the frame, as it will take paint much better if it's taut.  Obviously, stitch the sheets together first!  My suggestion would be to draw your ideas on a normal sized sheet of paper, and then once you've got something you like, there are two ways of transferring it to the backdrop.  The first is to divide the drawing up into a grid, divide the backdrop into a similar grid (same number of squares) and do it square by square; the second is to get an overhead projector, transfer your drawing onto transparency and project it onto the backdrop - you'll probably have to fiddle with the distance between projector and backdrop to get the sizing right.<br>  <br>  If it looks like you're still supposed to be building the set, why not only half-paint the backdrop?  Have all the outlines roughed in (black paint with a thin brush) but don't have all the colours put it, like you haven't had time to finish it.  Rather than painting a ladder, have a ladder on the ground in front of the backdrop (if you have room).  It'll look much better if it's actually not finished than if you've painted something to look like it's not finished - plus it will be much less complex for you!  Plus this way, it probably won't matter quite so much what the picture actually is, if it's supposed to be half-finished.|`|8OHsqwo6aa	read the scrip.  behind the action and conversation the writer has given you an environment.

2ucN3YXRaa	This is actually a very interesting question. Salsa did not just appear one day out of a vacuum, but developed from other dances over many years. And it is also important for people to realize that salsa dancing is different in different countries specifically because of the influences of other styles of dancing and unique cultural traditions. Here comes a long answer with 9 video samples.<br>  <br>  Since dance is inextricably linked to the music it is important to understand certain thing about the origins of salsa music in order to understand the dance. The name “salsa” was not used to refer to the music or dance until the 1970s, prior to that the music was often called Latin Jazz. The roots of the music are in Cuban music styles. During the 1920-50s Cuban music dance became popular throughout world, in the United States it was particularly in the New York area where many Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants lived. You may have seen the TV show “I Love Lucy” where Desi Arnaz played a Cuban bandleader living in New York. This indicates how popular Cuban music was at the time, that they would even make a sitcom about it.<br>  <br>  The music that was most popular outside Cuba was son, guaracha, mambo, chachacha, and boleros. In New York the musicians began adding elements from Jazz to son and guaracha and this is what we have come to know as “salsa” today. Musicians also add elements from their own cultures, for example Puerto Ricans may mix in rhythms from plena while Cubans will mix with rumba and other afro-Cuban genres as well as with funk from the United States, and Colombians may add a touch of cumbia.<br>  <br>  So knowing that all of these bits and pieces make up the music, of course the dance you see today has developed out of the original dances that matched each musical genre. The main roots of salsa dancing are the following dances: son, mambo, Afro-Cuban rumba. However each country has added their own special characteristics to the dance and there are even variations from city to city. The main salsa dance styles that people talk about today are New York Style, LA Style, Cuban Style and Colombian (Cali) Style. There is also a Miami style which is very similar to Cuban style but has also incorporated details from American styles of dancing. <br>  <br>  Here are some examples of these different dances<br>  Son (developed around the turn of the century 1900)<br>  There are many types of son, some are faster others slower.<br>  Here is a couple demonstrating the dance to a son montuno. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI7TDQxMACQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI7TDQxMA...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a couple dancing a fast son in 1938<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtX04FNpwbE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtX04FNpw...</a><br>  <br>  Mambo (developed in the 40s/50s as a variation of son)<br>  Here is a performance of how mambo was originally danced<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqc1bAwMsrU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqc1bAwMs...</a><br>  <br>  Rumba (developed in the 1800s)<br>  Think of it sort of as you would the mating dances of birds, where they move around each other trying to impress but rarely touch. The woman is sensual and wants to keep the man’s attention, the man tries to show off with cool moves and then suddenly he tries to “vaccinate” her with a rapid movement towards her pelvis. She blocks him with her hand, rejecting his advances. Cuban dancers often mix in rumba when dancing to salsa.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48156Mf1KSU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48156Mf1K...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some examples of how these dances have developed into variations of “salsa” <br>  <br>  New York Style (many people in NY still call the dance Mambo)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTIhekjRE1E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTIhekjRE...</a><br>  As you can see they really don’t use much from original mambo, it is probably closer to son except that they don’t rotate. In the US people dance back and forth along a straight line. They also do a lot of arm styling that has been taken from ballroom dancing. Also they do “shines” which is when the couple separates and they each do their own step combinations. I don’t know if this is related to rumba or comes more from the influence of dancers like Fred Astaire.<br>  <br>  LA Style is very new. It developed probably in the 80/90 and was “invented” by a group of brothers who moved to LA from Mexico. They have specifically said that they were impressed by dancers like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and have tried to incorporate that into their dancing.<br>  Here is a video with samples of all the brothers dancing. LA style is a more showy style of dancing that uses a lot of acrobatic moves.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vbYn9iJ7GM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vbYn9iJ7...</a><br>  <br>  Cuban Style has remained much more in touch with the original roots dances. Casino (Cuban style salsa is called casino) is very similar to son except it has a lot more moves and it is danced On1 rather than on2. As Cuban style salsa has developed, dancers have tried to outdo each other inventing new moves, mostly they are very tangly moves. Cuban salsa is danced in a rotational pattern rather than a long a line, which is a significant difference from US salsa styles.Here is an example of a couple dancing Cuban salsa, notice the rotation and the tangling and notice the rotation and the tangling and also they switch to rumba a couple of times during the song.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-30RzT2wn64" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-30RzT2wn...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a video that really shows the tangly, rotational character of modern Cuban salsa dancing<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rQk3Grj3kY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rQk3Grj3...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an example of Colombian Cali-Style salsa. Most Colombians dance a simpler version of Cuban style but in Cali they dance a style that takes elements from boogalu and is famous for its bouncy footwork. This couple also seems to use a lot of LA style drops.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEuhOR_Arh8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEuhOR_Ar...</a><br>  <br>  So as you can see, salsa is first off *not* a homogenous dance but varies from pace to place and yes it has certain basic roots but each country/city may add their own spices to the salsa to give it their own unique flavor.|`|BeSZ4nXraa	Who's buried in Grant's tomb?

Theodora's unswerving will, superior intelligence, and acute political acumen lead many modern-day historians to the conclusion that it was she, rather than Justinian, who ruled Byzantium.  In 527 Justinian was made co-emperor with his uncle, the Emperor Justin, and was given the rank of August.  At the same time, Theodora, who exercised considerable power and influence over him even at that time, was crowned Augusta.  While Justinian's entire reign was troubled by wars in both the east and the west, Theodora's spheres of influence, although not wholly confined to domestic issues, concerned themselves with every facet of administrative, legislative, and ecclesiastical matters.  Her name is mentioned in every act passed during the period.  She wsa one of the first rulers to champion women's rights, passing strict laws prohibiting white slavery and latering divorce laws to make them more favourable to women.  <br>  <br>  In 531 she arranged the dismissal of the Praeteroian Prefect, John of Cappadocia, whose collection of revenues and general attention tot he financing of Justinian's military campaigns she thought inadequate.  In 532 two factions (the Greens and the Blues) united against Justinian and proclaimed the late emperor Anastasius's nephew Hypatius emperor.  Justinian, believing all was lost, prepared for flight.  But the indomitable Thoedora prevented a coup.  She persauded Justinian to stand his ground, and those troops loyal to the empeor were able to quell the revolt.  In the field of foreign affairs, she corresponded with and received diplomats and in general conducted any foreign policy that did not pertain to fighting battles.  her championship of the cause of Monophysitism, the Christian teaching emphasizing the divine nature of Christ, counterbalanced the orthodox view set forth by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, that human and divine nature coexist in Christ.

VOZWgWgLaa	The best secondary sources would be some basic histories of the First World War, with specific references the ending of the First World War. There was a documentary on PBS a while back titled "The Great War: and the Shaping of the 20th Century" that would likely be a good source for background information. They made a companion book to the series that you can probably find at your local library.<br>  <br>  It might be good to also look at any generic history of the Great Depression if you can find any written on a world history level, as the Great Depression made many of details of the Versailles Treaty worse, particularly the debts the Germans owed the US, who took over the reparations debts to France and Belgium, which was written into the Versailles Treaty. Although, you may need to look at books covering German history before the rise of Nazi Germany in 1933.<br>  <br>  For Primary sources, it's likely that there would only be two that would be helpful.<br>  <br>  One would be a copy of the Versailles Treaty, itself. If you can find a copy of it, likely online, you can then refer directly to various articles in the treaty to support your argument.<br>  <br>  The other primary source that you could use is Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Hitler dwelt on the First World War immensely and believed Germany had been stabbed in the back. It's likely that he included some references to the Versailles Treaty and the "stab in the back" mentality that was actually fairly popular in Germany.|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	wikipedia :)<br>  <br>  your profile photo is freaky|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Start off with 'The Economic Consequences of the Peace' by the economist John Maynard Keynes.

The funny thing is that you can learn by just doing it, you can be a fashion designer by just making designs. You're on your journey to being a great designer, and where you are now is crucial to that journey, because a journey is made step after step, you aren't just whisked away... it's the journey that is all the fun. You don't have to know what you're doing or how you're going to do it, for now, make peace with where you are, and feel relief because you know WHY you are doing it. And that is because you are interested in it, and no one has the power to change your direction, if you do not give them the reigns. The journey is long, but in the end it is only with yourself.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Loving shopping and telling people what to wear is more along the lines of fashion consulting, which might be more lucrative these days.  People worry about dressing correctly for dinner parties, interviews, and other societal functions and are willing to pay top dollar to have someone help them create a look for an evening, or even a whole new wardrobe.<br>  <br>  Getting your foot in the door as a designer at such a young age will be difficult.  You could do what someone else suggested and try to get a boutique to take a look at your work, but I recommend sticking with it and practicing so that you continue to improve and go to school for fashion design.  They'll teach you how to get ahead of the trends and how to market yourself.  You have to remember, no matter how good you are, competition will be fierce in this industry, and most of the people you're competing against have the skill and the training.  If you want a leg up, you need to do what it takes to gain your own edge.  Talent is fine, but educating yourself on how to do what you love for a living is the most important investment you can give yourself.  You're still young and have your whole life ahead of you.  Don't give up if this is truly your dream...but don't expect life to hand it right over to you at 13 either because sometimes it takes years to get where you want to be in life.|`|uC55n3HIaa	I know just the place! ^^ Have you visited <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> ? it's a relatively new website for aspiring designers to show off their designs, get feedback from people, and comment/view other people's designs!

0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	This is an excellent question!  <br>  <br>  Your simplest questions are always the most difficult and also the most profound. One that certainly requires the maturity to tolerate ambiguity  and not attempt to derive a small sense of illusory comfort in the idea that a more specific, operational defined term will save us from life's absurdity. It won't. It never has. Though we never cease to make monumental efforts to "organize" and tack on all manner of things which we rationalize, will add clarity, when in fact it is simply to divert our attention and calm us, temporarily. <br>  <br>  And that may be our real burden.<br>  <br>  Monuments can and have been built to our internal validity, but it doesn't do much for the external problem. Certainly we can't be accused of a lack of effort, but spinning our wheels never takes us very far. Perhaps it is not the wrestling that is the burden but our efforts to change the wrestling rules or find some other opponent that is far less formidable ( e.g., by projecting our own shortcomings onto the question as can even be seen here in some responses).   The burden is that we don't deal with the problem or to be fair, deal with it well. <br>  <br>  To our credit we can never delude ourselves for very long. Our lack of satisfaction may in fact, be a hopeful sign and actually say something about the nature of meaning.  For although our ability to survive may be an evolutionary function of our ability to derive meaning and predict outcomes, it does not seem clear how the expansion of so much energy towards the Big Question is helpful in that regard. Smaller questions have much more practical value and should result in a higher level of contentment. But we could no more stop our need for warmth than we could stop sticking our hand in a fire.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I think we miss that point, at least on some emotional level. We seem to act as if we are simply visitors, plopped down in this universe to take in the sights when we are really part of the integral function. The fact that we wrestle with Universal Meaninglessness may well have meaning. Our struggles with our hunger may be a burden but it can also be seen as an implication of nourishment.|`|XxDQGEalaa	I think it's a big part of it.

Capitalize a vague, abstract, grandiose phrase, go preach about it in a coffee shop, and maybe a few hundred people will become convinced that it's what it's all about. Enough that you can sell a book, get a degree and maybe ultimately get a job teaching other people's ideas at a community college somewhere, during which time you can self-publish the rest of your series about what life's burdens are.<br>  <br>  But a phrase like "universal meaninglessness" will not stand the test of time in philosophy. It sounds more like a style of painting anyhow. If you really want to get rich, go paint Universal Meaningless and then give a showing in New York. <br>  <br>  If you really don't like meaninglessness, try to be as specific as possible in your terminology.<br>  <br>  >>damn, what a bunch of testy thumb-jerkers. Figures considering the speechy nonsense in some answers here.<br>  <br>  There is no "Philosophy of Universal Meaninglessness," whether you made it up or whether it's been a jack-off subject in coffee shops for years.

(It's a pleasure to answer your question after my extended hiatus too.)<br>  <br>  Your question attracted my thoughts with it's two distinct inquiries; potential meaninglessness, and the potential burden of this undertaking to resolve the issue of our individual and collective futility.<br>  <br>  Let's address the concept of Universal Meaning.  While this has most likely entered the cerebral radar of all sentient life, there may be those of us whose focus is greater.  Philosophers beginning with the ancients have spent copious amounts of time and inquiry pursuing meaning, both from Universal and specific vantages.  Though this time, I am searching within to offer your question a personal response.<br>  <br>  We, like the cells in the human body, are part of a cosmos greater than us.  Yet do our own organic cells question the reason for their existence when they might be aware only of themselves?  Just as our body is constructed of a myriad of cells, tissues and biological rhythms, we may only have a momentary glimpse of the vastness of our role in the body of life, if at all.  Regardless, the physical body comes alive with or without our agreement.  Meaningfulness or lack thereof is not based on opinion, it is based on factors far greater.  Our lungs do not question the appropriateness of their own respiration, but breathe they do, for 900 breaths an hour.  If we care for them, our hearts beat greater than two billion times in an average lifetime.   All of this is accomplished for as long as there is life in the body they occupy, and without question.<br>  <br>  Allowing for the prospect of the presence of futility to carry the ultimate burden, shall we grant ourselves license to judge all life and discard it's value?  Again, similarly to cells in the body, all biological organisms perform a function.  When that function is complete for benefit of the whole, a cell's purpose is served.  But is that cell called upon to voice it's opinion, or opt out of it's role for any reason it deems suitable?  How can it, when the cell is most likely unaware of it's own function within the grand design.  Does the cell observe other cells and compare it's value and potential burden to it's neighbors?  It would be impossible to assess value where a Universal purpose cannot be determined based on one perspective within billions (and billions and billions...).  One might ask why the cell is wrestling at all?  <br>  <br>  It could be considered that the cell is bordering on arrogance or perhaps narcissism beyond it's own design and ability.  <br>  <br>  In summary, without having a clear picture of the Universal Meaning from the Micro to the Macro, there is no meaning nor purpose to wrestling itself.  And if wrestling has no meaning, then how can this action of wrestling justify it's own existence?  <br>  <br>  Without our consent to accept a premise, it simply does not exist at all.  Therefore it is more accurate to consider the relevance of the question than it is to consider the relevance of the answer.<br>  <br>  (I just kept typing and didn't see this one coming...!)|`|yva8AsGTaa	Are you talking about the Ultimate Warrior?  Wrong section dude.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	For me,yes.  I cannot fight my way out of a wet paper bag.  I  just go with the flow and enjoy the adventure.|`|AA11562077	I'd tend to agree with kozzm0, or the more genteel Clair de Plume.  "Universal Meaninglessness" must be by definition an internal perception.<br>  <br>  "There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance—that principle is contempt prior to investigation.” – Herbert Spencer<br>  <br>  No matter how chaotic our circumstances may seem, there is no reason to postulate that the Universe is a continuous repetition of this. In fact, evidence and experience would point to the contrary both for us and for all things in general. "Nature abhors a vacuum" -- and entropy as well. Even at the nanospopic level, for instance, the only thing that can negate the Uncertainty Principle is lack of observation. In other words: We count.|`|JdYVmsNaaa	I agree that there's always a reason to keep searching for Meaning. Even not knowing if capitalized "Life" is a jigsaw too large to see, or if it is a creation--if our search is merely an artist's lament that her sculpture won't speak--there is always a reason to search. If the trans-dimensional anomaly proves elusive, we are still a step closer, and we find our own meanings (or that which is meaningful) along the way.  <br>  <br>  And yes, I think the process is an integral part of Life-- I say process because I don't really approve of wrestling.  I would rather play scrabble with Universal Meaninglessness, or take it to a baseball game, or even braid its hair. <br>  <br>  Yes, I’m joking now, but my point is: it's not within Human ability to stop feeling that lack of meaning, any more than it is within our ability to, say--stop seeing the color yellow. However, it is within our ability to define our relationship with that enigma. Some have patched the hole and ignore it; and perhaps some of those are truly content with the answer they found. Others pursue it courageously, and see in their mind's eyes more than most could dream. But it's always there, always an essential piece. <br>  <br>  For me, that Meaninglessness is a piece of the puzzle, but not a burden. My comparison would be Love [definitely capitalized ;-) ], because Humans, those odd beings, fall in love when they are strangers. They share their thoughts, their dreams, their bodies and souls, and they feel as one. Still, their minds never can touch. Thirty years can pass, and a lover will blink and find a stranger. That's not a burden that makes Love impossible or tedious; the uncertainty is just an accepted piece. <br>  <br>  Meaning (or Meaninglessness), to Life, is exactly so; it's a portion that we accept. So forget the wrestling and start the romancing. Do what you like with Universal Meaninglessness. Hell, you can even spend a day capitalizing everything, in that boisterous German fashion! <br>  <br>  Just enjoy the cosmic dance. :-)  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LSo_R1KVRk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LSo_R1KV...</a>

QpNCY2lxaa	Hi There!  Iam the mom of the Michigan Jr Preteen Queen and I can tell you from 6 years of experience with this unbelieveable organization, It is definitely not rigged!!!  Just the opposite actually!  NAM separates the optional judges from the overall judges at all times!  The judges for the queen and her court are not even allowed to watch any optional contests at all!  One of the really cool things about our judging panel is some are actual celebrities or have worked closely with someone famous in the past!  Their credentials are always really impressive!  Our directors have a very close hands on approach to the way each state pageant runs and are quick to correct any problems and aim to meet each families every need!  My daughter didnt win until her 5th year and although its been pretty fabulous having her represent such a classy organization and seeing her have the time of her life, it really isn't the point of the program at all!  All the other years I made it a point to teach my daughter to be happy for the winners!  She was always excited to give the winner a little congrats gift and hug them!  She never left any NAM stage in tears or frustration and that was because NAM makes every girl feel special at all times!  This year at Nationals she didnt make the top ten and I was so proud to watch her clapping as she left the stage!  I am a real outgoing person and I just gush when I talkm about everything NAM has done for my child and our family!  If you go to your state with the attitude of learning new skills, making new friends, having fun and just being yourself, you will be amazed about how you look at the whole experience and will be counting down the days until the next year.  You just might be pleasantly suprised if you go with that mindset!  Remember we are NOT a BEAUTY PAGEANT!!!   Shows such as Toddlers and Tiarras, Little Miss Sunshine and news reports about Jonbenet are NOT accurate portrayls  of the NAMiss program!  Visit our website and checkout our mission and goals!  Don't miss out on the best time of your life because of speculation and rumor!  Come back this year and if you have doubts ask one of our staff members about your concerns!  Eventually you will find out they are like a second family to you, we love our staff so much and have such a strong bond with them!  Feel free to email me anytime and I will help answer your questions too!  My email is jaylecaprara@hotmail.com.  Iam not a pageant mom, I am a NAM mom!  Nothing else even compares or comes close!  Best wishes to you and your family!  Jayle C.|`|MhWDuumiaa	i did it last year too! and i am going again!!  I didn't see anything or feel that it was rigged.  I ddin't enter any of the other contests, but I am this year (model and acting and phto) - I hope to win Promise Model and get a modeling scholarship!!!  But, if i don't that's ok.<br>  <br>  Anyway - some of the girls that won had done some of the other contests, but the girl hwo won in my age only did photo and didn't get anything for it.  So - I don't see how it would have been rigged.<br>  <br>  Just go again and have lots of fun!!|`|YqcbWltsaa	I agree with Michigan Mom.  My 2 daughters have been in it going on 3 years this year.  They both love it.  Several of the girls we have seen crowned have not even competed in optionals or if they did they either won one or none.  I have yet to see a girl get crowned that I felt didn't deserve it.  All the girls and their families are classy and down-to-earth.  That is the only reason I let my girls continue in this pageant system.  The people they show on TV scare me.  I would be so embarrassed as a mother to be shown in the audience doing my daughter's "routine" with her so she can do it properly.  If my girl doesn't know what she is doing then I don't let her go up there.  Just be confident in yourself and don't go into it expecting to win.  There are a lot of great people out there in this world and they can only crown one!!  Learn from every competition and work to better yourself for yourself...not for a pageant.  Good Luck!|`|4WCH9898aa	I did the National American Miss pageant last year and had a relly great time. I know it is not rigged because my friend was in it too and she did not enter any optional competitions and she won! My frind has been in National American Miss fro 3 years, the other years she entered Talent and Acting, but this year she decided to just do the pageant. I think the optional competition are so more girls can win trophies and prizes and not just one person, I like that!<br>  Have Fun and Good Luck!

93r3nCM1aa	Wherever KK works.....I want in. Geez. <br>  <br>  IMO, no one in their right mind would pay $75 for a 500 word article to a noob. I certainly wouldn't. Now, if you have experience (like a degree and whatnot), then that's different.<br>  <br>  But still....I still think $125 for 500 words is a bit much. I could write 500 words in about 1 hour.<br>  <br>  If your rate is too high, it's going to REALLY easy for the client to simply hire someone else, and trust me...in the writing business, there are writers willing to work for pennies (literally pennies...I started at 1 penny per word). <br>  <br>  Pay will also depend on what it is you're doing. If it requires extensive research, then obviously you will want to raise the rate to accomodate for the input of time. But if someone is just asking you to re-write some website content, that's a pretty low-paying job.<br>  <br>  When your new, the best thing is to value experience over steady income. Even if you are writing for pennies, you're getting experience...which will help you far more in the future (don't work for free though...it look unprofessional.)<br>  <br>  Another thing...there are a lot of job out there that are really low paying, and say that you can write x number of articles per week and make $500 in a month....skip over those. From experience I can tell you that if you're making pennies, it's not reasonable to expect yourself to be able to write countless articles a week just to make it by (this is why most freelancers have a second job when they first start out).<br>  <br>  My first ever freelance gig was writing for a website. I got .01 per word, most articles ranged from 300-500 words...and I was really pumping them out. The first 2 weeks I think I earned $300. And then I realized it really sucked and was so time-consuming and exhausting, I had to write for literally 12 hours a day, and it sucked. <br>  <br>  The best writing jobs are the ones where you draft a proposal before writing (like elance). If that's what you're doing, I would say start at like $50 for a 1200 word article. That's about .04-.05|`|YorMkZYAaa	If these are articles you're working with set an article rate, not a per word rate. Per word rates when you're freelancing doesn't help you one bit, at least it doesn't in my opinion. You don't say what your background is with writing, how much experience you have, what your education is, etc. This helps immensely.<br>  <br>  I typically charge around $125 for a 500 word article with minimal independent research. That; however, is usually a one time rate and businesses that will need more than one will be charged significantly less. I am also factoring in the poor economy and will charge (eek!) around $25 for an article when a company desperately needs content but cannot afford standard rates.<br>  <br>  For the record, my background includes journalism, copywriting, feature articles, and business plan writing. I have been a professional writer for seven years now and still struggling to get anywhere with it. Hard work, competitive field; hell, even hacks taking over make it a challenge when it comes to freelancing.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to start high and work your way down until you can agree to a respectable rate that is fair and reasonable for both parties. For 500 words start at $75. For 1200 words, start at around $100. <br>  <br>  More than likely you will be lucky to command a rate of $25 for the 500 word piece and $50 for the 1200. Tough business these days and even tougher to land decent paying gigs. Write well, set a WRITTEN agreed upon rate, and stick to your deadlines. Nothing is worse than a writer who cannot meet deadlines. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck. Not easy work but when writing is your passion it is well worth it.

AA10699315	Ashes (Book One in the Gray Area Series) by Stefanie Ellis:<br>  <br>  Sidney Fox was your average seventeen-year old girl. She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.<br>  <br>  After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, it’s just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.<br>  (The sequel comes out in march, it's called Illusions)<br>  <br>  City of Dreams by Stefanie Ellis:<br>  <br>  Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old. She escapes a small town and bad relationship, winding up in New York City. She hopes to start over fresh and become someone new. Instead, she stumbles across a man. A man she hasn’t seen since high school, a man who always held her heart. However, things have changed for him, he’s become a world renowned figure in the world of entertainment. Skyler wonders how much fame has altered the man she once loved, and she’s determined to find out.<br>  <br>  To read the first chapter and find out more visit: <a href="http://www.StefanieEllis.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.StefanieEllis.net</a><br>  <br>  Note: On the website E-books are also available for $5.00 and delivered directly to your e-mail inbox.|`|wnIUyaMMaa	Well if you want something like the Twilight saga how about just going onto Google and typing in 'very long and slow fanfics'.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	The Age of Innocence was a great romance|`|J8xRVPulaa	Pathetic.|`|TjWymKRXaa	i will give you a list of romance authors. you pick what you like. my fav is diana palmer. laurie paige, mary burton, judith stacy, nora roberts, stella bagwell, cathy gillen thacker, marie ferrella, karen rose smith,  jackie merritt, susan mallery and linda lael miller. i have read many books by all these authors. i really, really like to read.|`|oWheKC37aa	cinderella <br>  lol|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	Jane Eyre is very romantic.|`|xrQQujHtaa	Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

NR3YnkVPaa	Its a good idea for a song. Looks good so far. In case you didn't notice, the word "converse" also means to talk with someone. It fits in nicely with the theme so far. You might want to play with that meaning a little more. It gives new meaning to the line: "Your old converse, I never let them go." Not only did you keep the shoes, but also the things that you talked about. Two meanings for the price of one. Keep up the good work.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	gayy|`|6JD1KKYcaa	it's weird.<br>  a converse?

AA10286634	It's been awhile, but I seem to recall destructible.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	Pretty sure it would be indestructible. Since it is immaterial. He needs this so it can survive the death of the body.|`|Xxviy63Paa	Descartes style was not to argue things through to a conclusion. He would just pose a problem and then thrash it around for a while and at the end he would sort of say it wasn't such a problem anymore. Kind of like saying "well, that's about all there is to say about that, I still don't know but I don't care anymore." <br>  <br>  Wittgenstein simplified this "escape from the Cartesian dungeon" process when he mentioned that most philosophical "problems" are, in fact, just word games where people take two overlapping uses of language, then argue endlessly about whether they're the same or different. Great for coffee-shops and 19th-century snobs. Terrible philosophy though.<br>  <br>  Applied to your question, those cartesian notions of destructibility and Mind can be endlessly bandied about based on just what a mind is and just what being destroyed is. Using the words "mind" and "soul" interchangeably is even worse. It borders on religion then, instead of just inviting nonsense.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is no consensus view in philosophy about anything. Not even among people who are paid for being philosophers, let alone among the unpaid few who are real philosophers rather than just schoolteachers.

But now as she travels to Oregon in disreputable company, the stunning Irish songbird's cherished independence is threatened by irresistible desires that beckon her into the arms of a handsome young preacher. Temptations abound for Matt Richards on a west-going wagon train teeming with shameless soiled doves. For though a man of the cloth, Matt is still a man - and tantalized by the blistering sensuality of a sultry, flame-haired vixen with emerald eyes.

Iu7yCzssaa	ok well the key to mastering things like that is to use the stella adler method( even though i should take my own advice lol) but practice walking with a blindfold , take off the blindfold, forget it and act! a man with one leg has more on his mind than having one leg right? the same thing with a blind person they still have to go through everyday life just like us, so if you want to audition with your eyes closed then do that just don't make it obvious that you're having a hard time functioning because you're blind..... a 4 year old can do that .just live through the character, don't prejudge her just because she's blind.... that's a bad actor move! hopefully i helped you out love! ps read up on stella adler techniques, it breaks it down better than i just did lol break a leg !!!|`|TT98PUQTaa	Watch the movie "The Eye" with jessica alba..<br>  and take notes.. shes amazing at acting like a blind girl!|`|szyrw5P0aa	go to support groups for the blind and their families and observe them. thats what chuck palahniuk (author of fight club, invisible monsters, survivor, and choke) does.|`|NjYCvfYGaa	Mentally, I think you just should just make everything pitch black.<br>  Act... you can't see anything. But you're not clueless you have to also at the same time be familiar because blind people arent just mindless gorillas, they can navigate.<br>  <br>  Physical, look straight forward. Practice moving your head side to side and keeping your eyes straight forward. When you walk, pretend all the props in front of you appeared out of nowhere, and try to grab it so you look like you're navigating.<br>  <br>  Good luck with auditions.<br>  Don't overdo it!

BBfIXcI0aa	I've been told a million times over: if you're considering acting, and can imagine possibly being happy with any other job in the world, do that. So, that's the advice I give to you. I'd back off on the acting if you're considering it as a career choice.<br>  <br>  This isn't to say you have to stop altogether - community theatres will always be looking for talented performers to fill their seats. If you're truly not into it anymore, though, there's no shame in looking for other passions.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	Maybe you just need a break, do something else for a while, if you decide to go back to theatre it will be fine and if you don't it will be fine too|`|hwvQy100aa	It's not that you should quit - it's that you have to want it more than anything else in the world, and be willing to sacrifice everything for it.  Like it says above, if there's is something else that you can do, do it.  This business is about rejection, and it takes a thick skin to survive.  That and wanting it more than anything else.  Meaning relationships, a 'normal' life, etc.  There are plenty of people who will tell you that they have success and a life, and good for them.  They are exceptions and have something else going for them:  contacts, good luck, etc.  Do you want it more than anything, and are you willing to give up everything in service to it?  Be honest with yourself, and make your decision.|`|YtLYg56Maa	I'd tell you now i'd love to have your job! if you no longer want to do it, then don;t. it's ALL up to you. if you think you just need to take a break, take a break. it's does cause stress sometimes. if your just having fun anymore, try another place. it's funner to go to another theatre... except for building you reputation up all over again. but that's pretty fun too!<br>  hope i helped!<br>  -Luna|`|AA12050428	I was the same but realised early on what a tough business it is to break into.

AA10749187	The Vikings. Though they could, they seldom attacked at sea, perfering pillaging to pirating.

JtZRxl7caa	In colorguard, you spin rifles, flags, and sabers (the swords).  <br>  <br>  During field season (it coincides with football season), the colorguard and marching  band perform together.  The band usually plays 3-4 songs while the colorguard does their routine w/ the rifles, flags, or sabers or dance.  And depending on your coach, he/she might want some props such as large feathers, ribbons, etc.  <br>  <br>  Then during winterguard season (late February - mid-April), the guard performs by themselves.  There is no band, but the coach will choose a song and the guard does their routine to it.  It's similar to field season except that the guard performs on a mat (called floor), and it's only one song.<br>  <br>  And uniforms.  It varies between schools.  For my school, we have a different uniform for field season and winterguard.  And for pep rallies, football games, and after performances at competitions, we wear spirit wear.  That consists of a skirt, pants, sweater, and t-shirt.<br>  <br>  Also, price varies between schools as well.

Il diaframma si usa aperto (f1,4-1,8-2 ecc) se si vuole isolare il soggetto dallo sfondo (ex nel ritratto); viceversa si usa chiuso (f/11-16-22) per mettere a fuoco più soggetti possibili (ex nei paesaggi); quindi il diaframma regola la PROFONDITA' DI CAMPO, cioè la zona nitida che sta davanti e dietro alla linea di fuoco.<br>  <br>  2. Il tempo di scatto si usa veloce (1/500, 1/1000, 1/2000) per bloccare l'azione, lento se si vuole dare l'idea del movimento.<br>  <br>  3. Nella composizione una regola semplice è quella di dividere il fotogramma in 3 parti orizzontali e 3 verticali, e usare questa maglia come struttura compositiva, e mettendo i soggetti principali negli incroci delle linee divisorie:<br>  <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regola_dei_terzi" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regola_dei_...</a><br>  <br>  Per il resto guarda questo sito:<br>  <a href="http://www.abc-fotografia.com/corba/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc-fotografia.com/corba/inde...</a><br>  <br>  e qui trovi qualcosa di composizone fotografica:<br>  <a href="http://www.fotochepassione.com/composizione.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fotochepassione.com/composizi...</a>|`|mUou3VwWaa	ti linko un paio di post interessanti<br>  vedi se per cominciare va bene ; )<br>  <br>  ---<br>  che intendi per precisa??<br>  io provo ad aiutarti volentieri ma non sono sicuro di capire di cosa hai bisogno ; )<br>  <br>  ---<br>  vuoi insegnare fotografia senza saperne nulla??<br>  vedrò un po' in giro ma la vedo nera|`|a261228e691d5acdaf525ee3477fdb09aa	www.nadir.it vai in tecnica, lì trovi tutto spiegato in modo semplice. ciao|`|JMK8dQhbaa	ciao, frequento l'istituto prof di lecce, e proprio in questi giorni a scuola c'è un esperto molto bravo che ci sta facendo capire la fotografia in modo molto semplice e interessante, ti dico quello che ho capito: se vuoi fare la foto di un ritratto e se vuoi che lo sfondo esca sfuocato per poter evidenziare il primo piano devi diminuire la profondità di campo, per fare questo devi aprire il diaframma, più è chiuso il diaframma e maggiore sarà la profondità di campo, il diaf chiuso si usa quando vuoi fotografare i paesaggi. questa è una cosa che ho capito

Women began to speak out around the 60 years earlier when Anne Hutchinson was banished from the colony. However, there were not many other major events happening at this time, especially in the New World colonies. In Europe they were nearing the end of the Nine Years War, as France continued to try and restore King James II to the English throne. Otherwise nothing major.|`|564adae6f624ae6f7e88c6f3c88975daaa	Well a bunch of tobacco farmers got together and decided to invent cigarettes but needed a name so one farmer said "Kool" and the others said no, how about "Salem".Well the guy who thought of "kool" said "Salem" would never be a good name and it would all go up in smoke!

Eso mismo suele ocurrir cuando un hispano llega  y en vez de adaptarse a lo que hay se trae consigo sus costumbres y su manera de hacer las cosas.<br>  Si usted viene a mi casa y me pide que le ayude y yo le admito y le invito a vivir conmigo, usted no puede  imponer sus normas y sus costumbres cambiando asi el funcionamiento de mi hogar. Si se empe?a en hacer cualquier cosa que  hacia en  su pais y que  aqui no  es  bien vista  comenzara eso que  usted llama racismo.<br>  Si yo después de  advertirle de las normas que debe regir en mi casa  veo que usted las pasa por alto, y entonces le expulso o le denuncio o cualquier cosa parecida, no me puede decir  que soy racista, por que  en mi casa ya  hay unas leyes (Tal vez diferente a las que usted tenia en la suya) y que usted no  repeta.<br>  Si es verdad que  a veces pagan unos por otro pero cuando la sociedad ve que no todos son iguales a ese que no lo es  se le trata como a uno mas. Hay muchos gitanos muy respetables y mejores personas que  los demas que no lo son. A esos no se les margina. Se les alaba y respeta.Por que el respeto hay que ganarselo, Amigo. Igualmente de  cualquiera que se sienta marginado. Yo prefiero un hispano honrado a mi lado que a 100 espa?oles que no lo son.<br>  Lo unico malo es que mientras descubren que esa persona es  buena gente, paga por lo que otros de su raza o pais han echo antes.|`|524588dfb597699813d654fdb7b3b5c5aa	SUPER RESPUESTA<br>  <br>  SI ES CIERTO PERO TU YA NACISTE PARA ESCLAVO...LOL.

89PFRyEXaa	The one thing we want is not the only thing we need. I want cookies more than any food. In fact I would love to only thrive on them. But the truth is, I need food from all food groups. King Midas loved Gold more than anything else, but he needed other things to continue living. We cannot let desire blind us from necessity. Perhaps we dont know what we want, because if we did we would never over look something we need. Someone could love shopping, but that same person will always stop by the food court because they need food more. King Midas didnt actually know what he wanted with his wish because he did not take into account his needs. |`|26b727784ab6c6917ee0c334293b7446aa	Little good does all the gold in the world do you if you are all alone; King Midas even turned his only daughter into gold, his wife, his entire family was dead and she was all he had left.  I think it was at that point where he asked Dyonisus to take back his "gift."  The lesson was, that while its good to be financially secure, to keep your family fed, clothed, etc, and guarantee their education, in the end it is a fool's game to value gold more than your family.<br>  <br>  My own father, I have a feeling, is consumed by his work....|`|aDiesAQmaa	Always read the fine print, and watch out for the god of wine.|`|HiXHVqlYaa	That greed will blind all men.

I heard, I blessed <br>  The little English, English-speaking things <br>  For their sweet selves that laid my wish to rest, <br>  For their sweet help that lent my dreaming wings; <br>  And, most of all, for all the thoughts of you <br>  Which make them smell more sweet than other violets do.|`|jQoYYR5saa	Edgar Allen Poe- The Raven<br>  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow - Excelsior<br>  |`|NiwxUjfBaa	I second the Raven idea. It has strong rhyme and meter, and so is easy to get hold of, but it is also a very dramatic and moody piece. You can really get stuck into it, speaking quietly to build up suspense, and then crying out with anguish during the despairing parts. If you can act at all, then this is the one for you. I tend to perform it just slightly quicker than I do other pieces to give a sense of madness, but with pauses where needed. It is one to enjoy, and that is also important. It is much easier to perform a poem one enjoys performing!<br>  <br>  btw. The Homer Simpson version is the best I know of, and you should be able to get hold of a copy. It could be a big help.

L5S6rpI7aa	Bhangra is a form of dance based on the folk culture of Punjab, but it is not treated as classical dance. It can not be reasonably treated as the best dance of India even . Classical Indian dance includes'Kathakali', 'Kathhak, 'Bharat Natyam', 'Orisi '(or Odisi), 'Kuchipudi'. All these classical dance form have different form of presentation , developed, practiced and and inherited with regional tradition, each of these having artistic beauties of their own based on India's classical tradition and heritage. A particular form of these dances can not be treated as best.|`|yhcyvBOHaa	might be in some countries<br>  <br>  kathak & Garba in almost all|`|pvWua3CMaa	Any form of Dance which depicts the state of mind, body, and soul...|`|KwxZoTY8aa	As a Punjabi, I will say yes.<br>  However, I like giddha more than this.

vgPH9Engaa	Try limiting yourself to only two stories.  Write one story in your descriptive/emotional phase.  Let's call it 'Flustered.'  When you get to the point where you want to write in your humor phase, start up a new story.  Let's call it 'Quirky.'  When you get to the point where you want to write in emotion again, don't start something new, just go back to 'Flustered.'<br>  If the problem is a bunch of ideas that you don't want to lose, keep a notebook just for jotting down story ideas.  Write a sentence or two, no more than a paragraph, of the idea.  Then get back to your 'Flustered' and 'Quirky' stories.<br>  Try poetry.  It's shorter, but good poetry requires intense concentration and focus.  Yet it might be easy to slip in and out of your styles if you're only going to do so for a short period of time.<br>  The first idea should work, though.  You just need to discipline yourself.  Don't start new stuff until the old stuff is done.  And working on two stories at a time isn't all that difficult.|`|4147a50109498d46606a694f7b23b512aa	I think it would depend on the story; obviously some stories need to be told with humor and quickness, and others with description and emotions. First, I would try finding out which style would fit your story best. if you have trouble interchanging the two, then you need to just stick with one for a while. Then, when editing, you can always add more in later if its too heavy on just one style. i think that a book wouldn't be good if it kept interchanging anyways. Very deep, emotional books need moments of 'comic relief', but they do not need to keep switching from fast to slow to emotional to funny; it's like a bipolar book. So I think the best thing you can do is stick with one, but you do need to add the other style *sparingly*, meaning you need to just place a little of it in so that the book has more depth.<br>  <br>  One thing that helps me is to just write. I know that sounds strange, but a lot of people stop to edit their works. Beginnings are often the hardest part of the story, so just write it and continue the story. Later on, you can revise the beginning or even the whole story. But the best way to not get discouraged while writing is to not let yourself. Just keep going, no matter how bad you think it is. Let the editing come later.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, and sorry if its a bit long :)|`|AA11151307	I'd pick the one style you're comfortable with and go with the flow--until you've mastered it completely. (That way, it won't threaten your overall creativity.)<br>  <br>  Yes, it's going to take time, but you shouldn't be afraid of waiting.<br>  <br>  Part of being a good writer is *patience*. :0)

bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	When Confederate and Union soldiers returned to Texas after the Civil War they found that wild cattle in the brush country of South Texas had experienced several excellent reproductive years and the brush was teaming with wild cattle.  However, before the civil war there were some cattle driven east to markets in New Orleans where they were loaded on ships and exported to various ports. There were also some herds driven northeast through the Texarkana area. Generally speaking,  the cattle industry bloomed in 1867 when cattle in South Texas were worth about three dollars per head in south Texas and about twenty-eight to thirty dollars per head at the rail heads in Kansas and Nebraska. It is at that time, beginning in 1867 when the big cattle drives began and several dozen men grew rich doing this. Cattle were shipped by rail to Chicago meat packing plants where the meat was iced down in railway cars and shipped back east.  People on the east coast were hungry for beef after the war and Texas had plenty of beef.|`|AA12095483	Because that's where the cattle ranches were.

Why?  Because a lot of the written word is very emotional, and exposing yourself like that is scary.  What I recommend is that you start by showing pieces you are confident about to close family or friends that you trust.  It may take some of the fear out of having your work seen.<br>  <br>  Also, just keep at it.  I know it seems like people will make fun of you or be creeped out, but a lot of times the truth is that people respect you for being able to put those words on paper.  Tons of people have trouble writing.  If you have the inspiration, don't waste it!

COME ON! NOT ROMANCE! vampires sparkle, are veggies(animal blood), and only 4 have powers? WTF! NOT VAMPIRES! she might as well used guppies! There aren't really any villans, the fight only last for like 3 minutes, no action or horror. when i heard that it was about a vampire and a human girl you know? i thought it was gonna be actionpacked and tuff, bt it turned out to be sappy and long!<br>  "I was looking down. Then i looked up too see him. He was not looking back. After a while of staring, I started to take to my friend. Later, i looked at him again. This time, he was looking back and he looked angry. i quickly looked down. after a minute, i allowed myself too steal another glance. he still looked ferocious. as i was thinking, my friend told me he was staring at me. when i looked at him again, he looked amused this time. next class was biology." AND SO THE WHOLE FRIGGIN THING CONTINUES LIKE THAT. i try to keep an open mind and try out books, but 100 pages of that nonsense was outrageous.<br>  <br>  - Bella is pathetic. She is so desperate for love that she's willing to give up her family and everything to be with Edward.<br>  <br>  <br>  - The author tied everything together with big, random adjectives that most of the time didn't even fit. <br>  <br>  - It was so long, yet nothing happened. All those pages and nothing special happened until the huge, predictable fight scene at the end.<br>  <br>  -There's too much sickly sweet syrupy romance. And it's only skin deep. She likes him 'cuz he's hot. He likes her 'cuz she's...well, I'm not quite sure why he likes her actually... She smells good?<br>  <br>  -Edward is a stalker and stupid Bella finds that romantic.<br>  <br>  -Bella is a friggin' pansy. Girl needs to grow a backbone and stop waitin' around for everybody else to come save her.<br>  <br>  -The conflict, which lasts for a grand total of 70 pages (out of, like, 500), is resolved in time for Bella's prom!

OAjN34M4aa	I can't imagine. I started reading when I was 5, and I have been a compulsive reader all my life since. I actually get uncomfortable with nothing to read. I read everything my eyes come across. I appreciate great literature, but I'm not too proud to read junk either (even if I have to groan and curse myself for wasting the time later.)<br>  <br>  By the way: I have somehow never read a single Twilight book. Reading the comments some people write here makes me glad of that.|`|TOAiSbPYaa	If I couldn't read I would be really, really, really, really, ( you get the point ) depressed, and my life would be very boring.|`|daFmqiIIaa	I would be very, very sad.

yQNit56Qaa	At the time of the Protestant Reformation (which is the time with which you are concerned), the pope had implemented a campaign of selling indulgences in order to "refill" the papal coffers.  How he accomplished this was by appointing a "commissioner of indulgences" in each country (e.g. Tetzel)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Tetzel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Tetz...</a><br>  <br>  Like tax collectors of old, it was the commissioner's assignment to raise money for the church - without regard to "fairness".  Naturally, the more funds that went to Rome, the fewer remained in England.  By separating ties with Rome, all the religious donations of the English remained in England!  And who was the head of the church of England?  You guessed it!<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|hd2uNljsaa	Well, it got rid of "Peter's Pence," the tax that was paid to Rome.

While at some point Meyer may return to Forks, it probably won't be one of her next works.  Also there is no guarantee that she would pick up at Renesmee.

Plus, she was covered in mud...but I dunno...it's a little too obvious.  By favorite arch do you mean favorite series?  Um....my favorite series is probably Power of Three.

AA11712689	Yes, BOTH are true.<br>  <br>  The Spanish Armada in Spanish: Grande y Felicísima Armada, "Great and Most Fortunate Navy".<br>  <br>  The Spanish Armada was simply the Navy of Spain.<br>  Just because it was beaten doesn't mean it completely destroyed.<br>  Half of the Spanish Armada fleet returned back home to Spain.<br>  <br>  THE Spanish Armada is usually known as the fleet that attacked the Kingdom of England.<br>  Later Spanish Armada simply meant the Navy of Spain.<br>  <br>  During the Spanish American War, The Battle of Santiago de Cuba on July 3, 1898, was the largest naval engagement of the Spanish-American War and resulted in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron, i.e. the Spanish Armada.<br>  <br>  These are NOT the two same Spanish Navys. <br>  One was in the 1500s the other in the 1800s.<br>  <br>  And actually, the 30 Years War was the reason Spain was no longer the World Power in Europe. After the war, France took claim to that role.|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	The Spanish Armada was defeated by Sir Francis Drake during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.  The game of bowls is apocryphal.  The American incident would have been a different fleet but might well have spelled the end of the Spanish navy as a world power.  Don't feel embarrassed about asking the teacher even about last year stuff.  The other possible source is the encyclopedia in the school library.
Th3bifTWaa	I also answered your first question- hope it helped?<br>  <br>  So, firstly, don't use text speak . [even if it's not part of the article: "so what did u think of this, honestly?" ]<br>  <br>  Now... <br>  You have some sentences that are really choppy and can be combined to make it flow better .<br>  <br>  eg .<br>  <br>  "I was already late. I knew that much without having to check my watch."<br>  <br>  could become. .<br>  <br>  "I knew I was late without having to even check my watch."<br>  <br>  - Remember to CAPITALIZE your "i" 's <br>  <br>  - Watch out for run-ons. <br>  <br>  - Never use numbers for writing unless it's for the date or for money. <br>  eg "... spent most of the 4 hour journey.."<br>  <br>  - "...baby's who squall through the entire... " baby's should be babies. that's the plural for it .<br>  <br>  Overall, the description is good, and it sounds like something I'd like to read because, despise some convention errors, it's well written.<br>  <br>  Just remember to edit!<br>  <br>  Good luck writing! <3<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT :<br>  oh, I missed the "will be edited at a later date."  Sorry for the editing rant, then .<br>  <br>  I liked it, overall. Seems to be getting somewhere good . It also makes me wonder what you were late for, exactly.

AA11441385	Ancient Greek architecture was constrained by two things.  They had not invented the arch or concrete.  This limited what they could build by column and beam architecture carved from stone or wood.  The invention of the arch and concrete has meant that greater voids can be spanned freeing up the forms that were available to architects and builders.  Compare the medieval cathedrals with the Parthenon.

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too|`|Rhuyvq2Zaa	Try "The Protector of the Small" series by Tamora Pierce.

wEEOvu5Waa	Yessssss! Please, id give anything to have the HP freaks back rather than these people who fantasize over a fake vampire and a moronic female.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I'm also sick of people who claim to be sick of  Twilight.<br>  <br>  If you're that sick of it why make any kind of comment about it?<br>  Why not just ignore it?|`|ujzkiqU0aa	Nope, i dont get sick of it..but u know how ur soo sick of it..then why r u posting this question ur just talking about it more..and u will prob. talk to other ppl about this and say omg dont u hate ppl who read twilight and arent u sick of it well..ur just like the others who talk about it all the time..so get over it|`|uNIHqmH8aa	More sick of the people complaining about it. So now I shall attempt to talk sense into them!<br>  <br>  First off Twilight is a book, a movie, nothing more. So it's the big 'thing' right now with teenage girls! SO WHAT?! They can think what they want, they can ask what they want! I am very happy that they do! It got people READING! people who had never picked up a book read FOUR, and they LIKED them! It got them thinking, and asking questions!So maybe you understood it or didn't read it. Frankly, I couldn't care less. As far as I'm concerned anyone can ask any question they want! But if your going to complain about someone else asking a question. Then I'm going to complain about your question. I think that's fair as, these questions....they really aren't worth my time. I only answer them for 2 reasons, 1) I want the points, I'll admit that, 2) I like making points to people, it entertains me! and 3) I haven't seen a Twilight question in a while...<br>  <br>  That's my take on it all.... you don't like it stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine.<br>  -Nov|`|h9Mq5NwMaa	NO! i will never be sick of twilight and clearly you have not even read the series. and until you read the series "i think" you shouldn't say anything. and i am sorry if you have read the book. twilight is awesome. cus i "hated" twilight until i read it and i loved it! u should read it too!|`|swigidUeaa	yes, it's not even that great.|`|AA11151307	I wish it'd die a quick and agonizing death.<br>  <br>  I think the hype and craziness surrounding this series is making it hard for some of us writers to write something *meaningful* about vampires--without having to be sucked into a world were pre-adolescent teenage girls can't control their hormones over some half-dead guy with real bad skin tones.<br>  <br>  I mean...<br>  <br>  I thought I was nuts...?<br>  <br>  But this whole thing just takes the booby-prize--seriously.|`|Dv6KSxmlaa	I love how there's now a facebook group called "I watched Twilight and now I have unrealistic expectations in men!" or something. Yeah, I completely agree with you. It was an alright movie, but when people start talking about Twilight lately, rude comments like "Shaddap!" now come to mind.|`|Th3bifTWaa	I don't always mind .<br>  I mean, it gives most of my friends and I something to laugh about at lunch time, instead of the usual dull conversation.|`|iB22RWkGaa	I almost enjoy twilight questions.<br>  <br>  But only because I can make fun of it or point out why it sucks.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: How come all the twitards assume that just because you dont like it you havent read it?

rzcUtflhaa	Good poem!
cJQdhGYJaa	yes it was rather interisting but i do have to admit jacob's point of veiw was pretty boring<br>  And i would love to read it in edward's point of view <br>   think she should continue on and leave renesmee out of the story for a little while too|`|ePpCKNT6aa	For the most part I enjoyed the book, but I agree that the part about Jacob's point of view was kind of boring and unnecessary. Personally I don't think the book should be written in Edward's point of view because some of the appeal that Edward carries is that he's kind of mysterious.|`|alAq4wPEaa	Yea i do. I heard that there coming out with books from edwards point of view.. Honestly this was my favorite book out of the whole series. She is finally a vampire. She should write more about the pregnancy and the inbetwwen stories of the baby growing up.. I think she needs a story of the baby..|`|iB22RWkGaa	Renesmee made that book retarded.|`|qnpSlsvGaa	i dont think the book was written as well as her other books. i think the only thing that really made it good was knowing what the characters were like, and so we all love them, and are kinda oblivious to stephanies more themeless plot. it just went from thing to thing, and kind of draggged most scenes out. renesmee was cute, and bella getting pregnant really surprised me. i liked the rest of the book, and i thought the new concepts about bella and edward were really cool :D i hated the part where bella was pregnant though, and edward was the burning man. it was so sad and strained.|`|Ti476VHkaa	Honestly, I do not like the twilight series. They bore me easily.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	yea i thought the jacob part was boring in the beginning but it strted to get good, i didnt want it too end to tell you the truth. And yea i thought renessmee did ruin it a bit, it was supposed to be about just edward and bella and his lil vamp/human ruined it lol. But yea it was anoying the whole volteri buildup being nothing, not a huge fan of the books, but was a good read to me.|`|40Ow9B1maa	i disagree with you i was happy that stephenie wrote about renesme i thouight renesme made the book she didnt mess it up at all i think as described in the book she is the cutest little thing in the world but i agree with you about the jacobs point a view it should have either been edwards or stayedin bellas|`|946a0de98c140058626f3f700cfaa468aa	I would rather know what was going on during the battle in Edwards point of view.  And also what he though Bella was up to when she was hiding something from him.  I think she should write all the books in Edwards point of view.  It brings so much to light.  Especially reading midnight sun.|`|QczEdd5qaa	all i can tell you are the following words:<br>  <br>  <br>  who?<br>  <br>  but as long as you like it, it's ok with me|`|INoFAZvAaa	i didn't care for any of it
az2ZBy3iaa	There never existed a totalitarian state according to the word's Western definition. Even in Stalin's USSR, which is often referred to as totalitarian, it is commonly understood that controlling the minds of people is simply impossible. After all, according to the definition of totalitarianism, since citizens need to active take part in it, how would it be any different than democracy? It can even be argued that democracies are really only totalitarian governments controlled by the mass media, the upper elite, etc.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm going to answer your question as if you're asking about the benefits of an autocratic governments. There are many, but I'll name just a few:<br>  <br>  1. Efficiency. When the power is held by a single ruler, the power to make changes lies solely with that ruler. Therefore, should he decide on something that he believes will be better for his country, he would be able to implement the changes immediately without the lengthy and oftentimes utterly useless debating process in a democracy. The interests of some people may be hurt at the time of the decision, but should the ruler make the best choice for his country correctly, the country would benefit greatly afterwards.<br>  <br>  2. Unity. In many countries, people tend to view government officials, nobles, and especially their kings/emperors as somehow "superior". In the West, it tends to be the divine right of kings; in the East, philosophies tend to promote a father-son-like relationship between the emperors and their people. This may prompt some to question the amount of power the king/emperor have at their disposal, but should the ruler be one that is capable of choosing the best courses of action for his country (why would the ruler try to do otherwise?), the people would have a core around which they can gather. This tends to give an incredible amount of unwritten responsibility to the ruler, usually moral in nature, and would naturally (assuming the ruler is competent) prompt the ruler to choose the best for the country.<br>  <br>  3. The ruler would be a lot more knowledgeable about his country than his subjects. As we all know, having lived in so-called "democracies" for such long periods of time, that people don't know best. In fact, most of the time, people are simply interested in their own interests being protected/augmented, not what's best for the country. Having a ruler who is patriotic towards his/her own country would counteract this problem. Again, assuming the ruler is competent, the people would eventually see that the best courses of action were taken even though their interests were hurt temporarily.<br>  <br>  4. Ultimately, it's still a democracy! Have you ever seen a single extremely unpopular (hated by its people, not by Americans, which disqualifies a LOT of the governments Americans claim are "undemocratic") government last longer than a century? Every revolution against an autocratic ruler occurs due to dissatisfaction among the ruler's subjects, and since revolutions nearly always need large amounts of supporters to succeed, winning a revolution is analogous to winning an election, with the differences being that the "terms of office" being much longer and bloodshed often being involved, and a revolution failing (nearly always due to not having enough supporters) shows that not enough people are dissatisfied enough with the current ruler, and therefore the ruler still has legitimate rule of the country.|`|5dycdvZoaa	It could, Totalitarianism is just an idea, it's the people in control who make it bad. If the dictator were a good person with just laws, then sure, but realistically, that probably won't happen.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	yeah,<br>  makes democracy more precious|`|FoIxsunVaa	Totalitarianism is one of the great forms of government that work. Something that works has beneficial aspects. The trains run on time for example.|`|Gslf19Uvaa	No. I'm all about individuality and the government staying out of our business as much as possible. Have you read "1984" by George Orwell? I would hate to live like they do, even if it were to a less extreme degree.

t8xFyCt0aa	How to get it published and on bookshelves:<br>  <br>  1. Query an agent. Make sure they actually handle the kind of book you have written. For goodness' sake, follow their guidelines and NEVER call them over the phone!<br>  <br>  *Some* agents do not take queries from unpublished writers. Most, however, will consider your work regardless of credentials! All "knowns" had to be "unknown" at some point.<br>  <br>  2. When the agent asks for your manuscript (fiction) send it to them. If you're writing non-fiction, you query BEFORE writing.<br>  3. The agent represents you and sends your work to publishers. Many publishers don't take unagented manuscripts now. Agents make money by selling your book and getting a percentage of profits.<br>  4. The editors at the publisher love your work and get the thumbs-up from their bosses, etc.<br>  5. You're published.<br>  <br>  Never pay publishers (that's called vanity publishing or Print-on-Demand). Also, don't pay agents who have "up front" or "marketing fees". Research these people before you put your trust in them!<br>  <br>  Websites for researching agents/publishers and making sure you don't get scammed, as well as how to write queries and a synopsis, etc.:<br>  absolutewrite.com<br>  agentquery.com<br>  publisher's marketplace<br>  Preditors and editors<br>  Writer Beware<br>  aaronline.org

This slowed down the economy. He screwed up unions by firing the air traffic controllers and endangering the public as that job take lots of experience.Wages have declined since.Unemployment was far worse than it is now only the depression was worse. Homelessness and food bank became everyday words. He was a nice guy with charisma and he was honest. At least he did not get us into an unjust war like GW Bush. Now all the yuppies who loved him are finding out what it was like to be on the unemployment line. To those shlocks who tell get a job or go work at MCDs try it.

His philosophy that capitalism is able to do the prophylaxis to itself and then advancing legislation to eliminate governmental regulation and overseeing, he created the conditions in which we are today (the biggest economic mess since the Great Depression)l  The final result is that  he is most responsible for bringing about the liberals to power today.  I'm a liberal and I'm grateful to Reagan.  Otherwise, we would have been out of power for who knows how many years to come.  So, Reagan has proved that liberalism is better than conservatism for our nation.  Just wait this 8 years and you'll be able to see it.  Adian.

fe2f81588ecd4cf84508234a973e6b23aa	It's terrific, and terrifically underrated by the American public, because of the horrid things done to it by American dubbers. If you're looking for something similar try Fairy Tail. It's similar in style and charm. If you're looking for something outrageous, try Bobobobobobo (some amount of bo's i forget). Not many manga's replicate One Piece's charm and comedy while putting in substance. Some general shonens are great, but stray away from super pervertedness, and I think you'd generally get a good time. (Fullmetal Alchemist, etc. have substance) Generally, I'm a fan of Seinen. If you're old enough...say...15 up...i'd say you should try the genre. Monster and 20th Century Boys are good. So is Vagabond etc.<br>  <br>  (Oh and next time, maybe Drawing and Illustration isnt the best category to go in)

rR9fqQOTaa	I'm not sure quite how i'm supposed to answer...but...<br>  <br>  You don't take the elevator, it would be slow and hopefully the creature will assume you took it and lose track of you. In an attempt to confuse and distract the creature you dart to the left and go through the door that leads through a small hall way to a set of back stairs. You run down them as fast as you can. Realizing that if the creature did believe you went down the elevator it would head towards floor level (what it assumed you would do, of course this assumption depends on the level of intelligence of the creature). To avoid encountering it you must only go down part of the way until you see another door leading back into a larger hallway. You must run as quickly (but as quietly) as you can towards the side of the castle and find the exit shoot hidden behind the paintings. The shoot lands you in the west garden, after that RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN and get to safety.

Rhuyvq2Zaa	Eragon is better written. His sentance structure and overall plot is better than Meyer's and improves with every book. However, while his plot line is very original, his overall ideas are not. His three main people groups (elves, men, and dwarfs) along with their languages, are straight out of Tolkien, as are many of his names. (Roran, Arya, Eragon...) However, his plot is original enough to make it almost completely forgivable. <br>  <br>  Twilight is original in the fact that Stephanie Meyer rather reinvented vampires. She made them easy to relate to, people, instead of monsters, or seductive creatures of the night. Her structure, grammar, and plot line, however, leave something to be desired. Her plot is not really a plot...it is characters. What I mean is, there is no great mystery to be discovered, no task to be accomplished. The story consists wholly of relationships (romantic, friendships, and otherwise). This is both impressive and silly. <br>  <br>  Both series have their pros and cons, and I would say that it has a lot to do with what you are looking for. <br>  <br>  Neither of them are up to par with true literature, but both are extremely entertaining.|`|fkynFhccaa	they are both great books, but Twilight definitely over rules Eragon.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Eragon by far.

IvfQdMNhaa	I think he was a major symbolist.  He used a lot of imagery and symbols.  A lot of the times he worded phrases in such a way that it almost had a second meaning.  He also chose to write in traditional verse as opposed to free verse which I think makes the poem much more important and prettier.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you find a good book of poetry by him and read it.  His poems may give you an idea on how he did all that stuff.  :)|`|xJoMSkI5aa	In a world full of Modernism, he stuck closely to traditional forms. While contemporary poets like T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were busy breaking down the entire history of poetic form, writing poems that jammed all sorts of forms together into a poem that started to work like a great big set of Tinker Toys, Yeats stuck to the classics. He returned again and again to age-old traditional forms (like ballads or Irish folk tales or even, in this case, ottava rima)<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Yeats

I've never read the Clique but I've read Twilight and that book is terrible. It's not very hard for any book to be better than twilight|`|8CVd0ePyaa	Um.. it obviously is. I mean the clique is basically about some stupid seventh grade girls who think all that. Twilight can beat the clique any day. And majority of the answers are probably going to "Twilight rocks. The Clique sucks " or something along those lines. So yeah Twilight is definitely better. It also has a better plot and better storyline. Maybe that's why it's a bestseller.|`|n9p5cycsaa	Yes it most definately is. There are characters that you can agree with always instead of having them all be 'evil' at some point. There are vampires which are awesome. It's got a true love that is wonderful to read about.

So she decides to spend two months undercover as an ordinary high school student. But could it be that real life high school is just as harsh as Hollywood?<br>  <br>  Secrets of my Hollywood Life: on Location-  It seems like the summer of dreams come true for Hollywood princess Kaitlin Burke: the media loves her (again), super-cute and funny Austin Meyers is finally her boyfriend, and she’s starring in a movie by her all-time favorite director Hutch Adams. What could be sweeter? But life on set is not as perfect as the makeup and costumes. And with an old love and a scheming new publicist on the scene, it’s about to get a whole lot messier.<br>  <br>  Secrets of My Hollywood Life: Family Affairs<br>  The filming for sure-to-be-blockbuster movie Pretty Young Assassins has wrapped, and teen movie star Kaitlin Burke returns to life on the set of primetime drama Family Affair. After ten seasons filming, she would have thought that she could see it all coming, but with a plotting new actress on set, all bets are off.

vmmMqhxXaa	"The Man Without Qualities," by Robert Musil (1967) took 20 years to write.  The first site below says "...it wasn’t even published until after he died. How annoying."<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Patrick O'Brian churned out his Jack Aubrey books at the rate of every one to four years.  Most of the 21 books in the series (the last unfinished) were published one to two years apart.<br>  <br>  The Leaf Blower (cited third below) has the funniest essay I've read on how long it takes to write a novel.  Funny but also astute.  Check it out.  (If the Leaf Blower is the Brian Crawford who wrote Isildur, it looks like it took him a year to 18 months from conception to publication.)<br>  <br>  You may want to get a copy of "The Weekend Novelist," by Robert J. Ray and Bret Norris.  They show you how to write a novel in 52 weeks, only writing on weekends.  It might work.  If it doesn't, you're only out $5.98 plus P&H.|`|daFmqiIIaa	It honestly depends.  If you're writing full-time, then you're going to finish it a lot faster than if you have to catch a spare moment.

What kind of schedual. There's a lot to consider making it difficult to come up with an average. A really tiny book could take a few months. Massive ones can take years. I'd say ... if you work dilligently, a 300 page book could be written in about a year? Dilligently as in: five days a week, more than one page a day. And then taking the editing into account ... maybe a little over a year? <br>  <br>  I know I finished a 400 page book in two years, but that's with high school and everything in between. And since I'm rewriting it, it's taking a lot longer haha. <br>  <br>  If you want to know how long it'll take you, just look at your work ethic and estimate how much you will write a day. Then, look at your story and estimate how long it should be in the end and multiply! (Anticipate writer's block and plot problems) <br>  <br>  :)|`|z9aQAixIaa	It really depends on how fast you write, and how long the book is, but if you are devoted to your work, you could easily get a good 500 page novel done in less than a year.<br>  <br>  i am writing a book at the moment and it is much, much more time consuming than i thought it would be, but you can get into it really quickly if you write often.|`|AA12095483	That depends on the book, the subject, the amount of research and the speed at which you write.

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?|`|ZCnlMUp2aa	twilight saga<br>  the host<br>  dangerous girls 1 and 2 <br>  city of bones and ashes|`|ZUL3drNgaa	OHHH ya:<br>  May Bird series - Jodi Lynn Anderson<br>  Coraline - Neil Gaiman<br>  The Land of Elyon series - Patrick Carman<br>  Fablehaven series - Brandon Mull<br>  Pendragon series - D.J.

0vlm2OZcaa	Anne Rice's books are good I started reading some of them back when I was in the 9th grade. I recommend her books for the avid reader who is up for a challenge.<br>  Quite frankly, these books are adult novels and are not exactly PG-13 or even PG so keep in mind that it can get graphic and have innuendos.<br>  <br>  You can read books from:<br>  Amelia Atwater- Rhodes. She started writing teenage vampire novels in 1999 way before Stephenie Myers when she was just fourteen years old. She has published a new young adult novel every subsequent year since her first and has moved from her family's Sudbury home to a nearby Massachusetts town.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/atwaterrhodes/bookshelf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.randomhouse.com/features/atwa...</a><br>  <br>  You can also read these:<br>  <br>  M.T Anderson- Thirsty<br>  All Chris really wants is to be a normal kid, to hang out with his friends, avoid his parents, and get a date with Rebecca Schwartz. Unfortunately, Chris appears to be turning into a vampire. So while his hometown performs an ancient ritual that keeps Tch’muchgar, the Vampire Lord, locked in another world, Chris desperately tries to save himself from his own vampiric fate. He needs help, but whom can he trust? A savagely funny tale of terror, teen angst, suspense, and satire from celebrated FEED author M. T. Anderson<br>  <br>  Look For Me By Moonlight- Mary Downing Hahn<br>  <br>  While visiting the remote inn run by her father and stepmother in northern Maine, sixteen-year-old Cynda feels isolated from her father's new family but finds solace in the attentions of a charming but mysterious guest. "Hahn deftly creates the proper atmosphere and setting for this spine chill.<br>  <br>  The Historian- By Elizabeth Kostova<br>  <br>  A chilling historical mystery that reaches from the present day into the medieval past of Vlad the Impaler, Wallachia's barbarous 15th century ruler whose gruesome deeds gave rise to the legend of Dracula. In The Historian, Kostova's characters hunt the immortal Prince Vlad across twentieth century Europe, from ancient village to dank crypt in a quest to destroy the vampire.<br>  <br>  When nineteen-year-old John Shaw returns from the trenches of World War I, he is haunted by nightmares--not only of the battlefield, but of the strange, cruel and impossible feats of his regiment's commander, Quincey Harker. Harker's ferocity knows no limits, and his strength is superhuman.<br>  <br>  These following books are for older readers:<br>  <br>  Sookie Stackhouse Series-Charlaine Harris<br>  <br>  Sookie Stackhouse is a small-time cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana. She's quiet, keeps to herself, and doesn't get out much. Not because she's not pretty. She is. It's just that, well, Sookie has this sort of "disability." She can read minds. And that doesn't make her too dateable. And then along comes Bill. He's tall, dark, handsome -- and Sookie can't hear a word he's thinking. He's exactly the kind of guy she's been waiting for all her life.<br>  <br>  But Bill has a disability of his own: he's a vampire with a bad reputation. He hangs out with a seriously creepy crowd, all suspected of -- big surprise -- murder. And when one of Sookie's co-workers is killed, she fears she's next.<br>  <br>  Anite Blake Series-Laurell K. Hamilton<br>  <br>  Anita Blake may be small and young, but vampires call her the Executioner. Anita is a necromancer and vampire hunter in a time when vampires are protected by law--as long as they don't get too nasty. Now someone's killing innocent vampires and Anita agrees--with a bit of vampiric arm-twisting--to help figure out who and why.<br>  <br>  Trust is a luxury Anita can't afford when her allies aren't human. The city's most powerful vampire, Nikolaos, is 1,000 years old and looks like a 10-year-old girl. The second most powerful vampire, Jean-Claude, is interested in more than just Anita's professional talents, but the feisty necromancer isn't playing along--yet.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades.

Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend.

Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner.

They'll not only help you to write better (tips, subjects to write about, using proper english, etc.)  but they also list places to submit your work (short stories, poetry, contests for writers in certain age groups).  There's a certain book called "the 2009 writers guide" that comes out every year so it's pretty up to date, and it lists a ton of places to answer your questions.|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	to get a book published you have to convince a publishing company to sign you up, and to do that it helps if you get a literary agent. to get a literary agent, you send them a letter describing who you are, what your book is about and a chapter or two that you wrote. if you go to the library or a bookstore you can find books that tell more about how to get published.|`|2QTktDQsaa	First, finish your book, and read through it like 2 or 3 times, so you can catch every mistake.

My advice would be to read, read, read--while practicing writing is a great way to improve your writing, reading is a fantastic way to learn new tips and tricks.<br>  <br>  If you want other advice, Google the websites of your favorite authors.  Almost every author that has a website will have a FAQ or Q&A section where they will tell you their tips on writing: how they find inspiration, what their techniques are, sometimes even how they got published.  There are also many help websites out there for aspiring authors--just Google them! In the meantime, keep writing your book--ask a friend you know who is an avid reader or great writer to help you edit it.  Good luck!

Here is an example: I'm in a grocery store parking lot when I see this man haul-off and punch his girlfriend in the face. I look around to see if anyone else seen this incident. I notice several people watching. But when they noticed me watching them, they quickly diverted their eyes. I called 911, who claimed to be sending someone to take care of the matter. I waited an hour for the police to show up, but the couple had already fled. No police. No fighting couple. So, I went into the store to talk to a manager. The manager says, "so what do you want me to about it." I walked away. Called 911 for the second time. The second time, they put me on the line with a police officer, who says, "Sorry, we don't deal with domestic issues." I went balistic asking, "What the hell they actually did deal with?" The officer told me to come to the police station to file a report. They did nothing!

AA11981114	1. You are correct.  Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908.  2. You are correct.  This alliance was formed in 1882 between these states.  3. You are possibly incorrect.  By 1888 Prussia had grown into the German state, but separate governmental organizations survived in each of the constituent states, including Prussia.  I would have answered C. Germany, but this is open to interpretation.  4. None of these is exactly correct.  Ministerial Responsibility can mean either that each cabinet minister is held responsible for the actions of his department or that each minister is responsible to the cabinet, rather than any other part of the government.  Of the provided answers, I would choose the second.  5. You are correct.  The major parties of 1871 were the Liberals and the Conservatives.  Since the first administration of Ramsey MacDonald (1924) the Labour Party has supplanted the Liberal Party as the dominant left wing party, but the Conservative Party remains significant.

You might want to try asking your question under the 'health' category and the subheading of 'diseases & conditions' or 'women's health' or 'mental health'....or you can try the social sciences...psychology.  The little that i do know about Karen's anorexia is that it got so bad that she died from it.  I think she had one of the most perfect voices...so talented...it's sad that she died so young.

Anyway... since you're so young, casting directors don't expect huge resume, but they do expect some sort of training. Experiencing acting school isn't enough.

STEVENS<br>  <br>  "ACTING TRUTHS AND LIES" (purchased at www.info4actors.com)<br>  <br>  TRAINING<br>  I think the first three classes that you should take before even engaging in a scene study/acting class are: Cold Reading, Commercials, and Improv.<br>  <br>  Why a cold reading class? How do you get the role? By auditioning! Auditioning and acting are two DIFFERENT worlds! In L.A. especially, the majority of your auditions are cold reads. You're lucky if you can get the sides the night before. Cold reading teaches you how to make sense of the script within a short period of time and also with in a limited space (you don't physicalize as much on auditions as you do when actually do the scene). After you get the part, you can always get an acting coach.<br>  <br>  Why commercials? Because those are the money jobs. Build your foundation with commercials so you can afford the best training and materials needed for a successful acting career. Commercials also don't require you to bust out your Meisner or Strasberg techniques. The commercial cds and clients just want to see real people.<br>  <br>  Improv is a must period. It teaches you how to not be self conscious, to use your imagination, and to make bold and quick choices. It also goes great with commercial auditions for a lot of them are improv.<br>  <br>  Stay away from those OVERPRICED "Acting/Modeling Schools" like JRP, John Casablancas, and Barbizon. There are BETTER and more AFFORDABLE schools. Of course you can have those three scammy schools on your resume and get LAUGHED OUT of LA and any other MAJOR market.<br>  <br>  AGENTS<br>  To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  RESUMES<br>  Here's the standard LA format. In NY, it's usually the same but with Theatre being higher up than Film/TV (/ denotes column breaks):<br>  <br>  At the top and centered:<br>  Name (Centered and is largest in font size)<br>  Union affiliation (if any)<br>  CELL Phone Number<br>  Email<br>  <br>  Far Left side below the top and centered stuff:<br>  Height <br>  Weight<br>  Hair color<br>  Eye color<br>  <br>  Right side opposite of statistics:<br>  Agent logo with contact info (sometimes if you have an agent, you can remove your own cell phone and email address. Then weirdos that find your stuff in the dumpster can contact them instead of you)<br>  <br>  Film<br>  Title/(Lead, supporting, featured)/Director<br>  <br>  Television<br>  Title/(Lead, guest star, co-star, regular, featured)/Network<br>  <br>  Theatre<br>  Title/Specific character played/Production company or director depending on who is more prestigious.<br>  <br>  Commericials<br>  ALWAYS put "List available upon request!" Do keep a separate list of the commercials with the Casting directors involved in case an agent asks.<br>  <br>  Training<br>  Skill learned/School or teacher/Location (LA, NY?)<br>  <br>  Special Skills/Abilities<br>  Be creative with this. When I was starting out and interviewing with agencies, they would usually go straight there and talk about my special talents and even had me demonstrate some of them<br>  <br>  DON'T:<br>  -Put extra work<br>  -Put Modeling/Print gigs. You make a separate resume for that.<br>  -Lie<br>  -Put age. If an agent asks you when you meet with him or her, then tell the truth. It's for legal reasons. ie. Under 18 can't work normal hours or you have to be at least 25 to do a beer commercial.<br>  -Put your home phone number or address unless you weridos coming to your house.<br>  -Put dates. It ages you!<br>  <br>  If you don't have too many credits or none at all, have a lot of training. That will show that you're still serious. Also be creative with your special skills and abilities.<br>  <br>  Headshots<br>  With regards to looks, you DON'T want character shots ie. literally dressing like a cop, doctor, etc. NO PROPS EITHER! This is an insult to the casting directors and will get you laughed out of this business. You want 3-4 GENERAL LOOKS!|`|3BfNshHYaa	uuuuuhh buddy, hate to brake it to ya but its not that easy! tons of ppl try to get discovered, and how many ppl make it?  a very, very small fraction of them.  and if u do make it, usually ur in a commercial or doing something that doesnt pay well<br>  <br>  but dont exactly give up, i would say.  try for an agent but keep in mind that most of them will scam u for ur money.  find an honest one before u pay|`|jUJ1gzbyaa	umm...idk who u talkin to...but NO.....it's NOT easy so who ever said that is obviously full of stupidity<br>  try to get an agent and go to like a camp this summer<br>  and trust me....it takes years usually to make it big<br>  but keep workin hard at it<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|eMccVmBkaa	get into a acting agency!|`|Cet7DXJ1aa	take actings classes, get involved in local plays and school drama, and try to find like a talent agency(?) in the area. shouldnt be too hard to do all that in LA.

E.g. The cat = Ze cat.     Furthermore, you could say, "Laurent spoke with a thick, French accent that was barely distinguishable" etc.|`|AA12268495	Rowling had it right ~ you should write some of the words phonetically.

g4rDDsVwaa	They were attempting to cripple the US Pacific Fleet.  They felt that the US was interfering with their attempt to build an Asian and Pacific Empire.  The US and Allies had cut off their supplies of raw materials like steel and oil, I believe, and they thought that if they struck a crippling blow against the fleet that we'd get the hint and leave them alone.  It didn't quite work out that way for them.|`|xQwU590Laa	The US had stopped exporting oil to the Japanese because of their invasion of China.  The Japanese were down to a few months of oil left for their navy.  They could either give up their dream of conquest or force the US into allowing them free reign in the Pacific.  They decided to attack Pearl Harbor to cripple the US navy and allow them to conquer the Pacific, and hopefully be too strong too quickly for effective US response.    They were less effective than hoped, and the US was also much, much faster in getting stronger than they believed possible.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	I believe it was in protest to our involvement in the war somewhere else.

In great detail.    Do your own homework.  LEARN SOMETHING.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	Are you looking for reason or objective, two different things.    Reason is real complex and can be traced back almost 50 years prior to the attack.  High tensions between the two countries, military build up, colonial expansion, nationalism, imperialism, and failed democracy are all reasons.  Add in a war between China and Japan since 1937 and that Japanese officials feared a riot if they left China, embargoes and a lot of failure to look beyond the prejudices that each country had towards the other.    Objective is much simpler.  Yamamoto wanted to cripple the US navy which was considered the greatest threat to Japanese expansion in the Pacific.  Once the US fleet was crippled then the Japanese military would conqueror several islands and territories and create a buffer zone upon which the US would expend it energy on before asking for peace.  Such a plan, it was hoped, would allow Japan to keep most of the conquered territory.|`|AA10304847	It was the only card they had left to play after the American oil embargo crippled their expansion in the Far East. A quick knockout blow of the US Pacific Fleet would end US dominance and US public isolationistic opinion would keep America out of a direct confrontation with Japan.  On both counts their gamble failed.    The US Carriers were not in port and US public opinion quickly changed from isolationsim to retribution....and the rest is history...the sleeping giant awoke!|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	It was to delay the involvement of the U.S. of entering World War II.

AA12343309	I guess a person could petition the court to change their name to Fulloffat, Baseborn, Slumkid, Hustler or whatever.    People in Europe did not have one until the last millennium. In England most had one by the end of the 14th century.  They were not started so much to identify you as a member of a family but for taxation purposes. They were based on a)being the son of someone b)where they lived c)some characteristic about them d) their occupation. When they got through it wasn't impossible for legitimate sons of the same man to have a different surname.  Still each could have shared their surname with others not related.|`|72DBWVBOaa	monaghan and donaghey and bolam and convery|`|AA11053540	Mostly it is to use your imagination. Many new names are various spellings of old ones, or combinations of old ones. Some are picked for the esoteric value of a place name, such as Madrid, Vegas, or other famous places.    As to the process, it depends upon where you reside.  Some courts will want the person to prove they are not hiding from the law when they request a name change.
LVZdzPmpaa	Kids are buying Meyer's books. They are not, however, literary critics. Announcing that a books is "THE BEST BOOK EVER OMG IDK!" is not literary criticism. It is sheep-like bleating from the inexperienced reader.    Stephen King is a writer's writer. He knows that he's doing, he surely knows that he is talking about when it comes to writing as well as literary criticism.    Thank you, Stephen, for telling it like it is.|`|QcsbthVIaa	THAT IS BULLSHIT!!!! she is my hero!!!|`|c26ff2882f72ebab8b91313ad7a34a8faa	I love him. He's 110% right.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	I couldn't have said it better myself :)|`|YorMkZYAaa	Bravo to King.     While I sometimes feel King is a bit arrogant in his approach to other writers, the fact is that he is spot on in this case. Meyer gave little thought or consideration to Twilight despite what the young (and painfully naive) fanbase may say. King changed the genre of horror forever and his books will live on. Meyer will be little more than a faded memory, an afterthought in the bargain bin once all the hype is gone.     J.K. Rowling is brilliant and captivated millions in a way that appealed to teenagers AND adults. Very few adults I know read Twilight for anything more than guilty pleasure and an escape from the realities and complexities of daily life.     I may not be the biggest fan of King but he is a great writer and deserves his fame, more so than Meyer.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	Everyone is entitled to their opinions.  I don't agree, I love the Twilight series.  No, they aren't literary masterpieces, but I still think they are great all the same.    I have not read the HP series, but I'm sure they are great too.  (I like the movies at least LOL).|`|v70p2kgWaa	It's horror/fantasy writer Stephen King (not director Stephen Speilberg).    Wow he managed to sum up my own opinion on the two seires.|`|qEh84eqNaa	I absolutely agree. Jo is a wonderful author.    I don't think it's arrogant of King I say that because he has proved time and time again that he is a good and capable writer. If he was a terrible author himself, I could understand how someone would think him arrogant. But he is an established literary figure who knows his craft well. I think he's earned the right to comment frankly on other authors writing.|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Oh man, he's so spot on.  =DD|`|w0ZGxfJJaa	I do not agree at all! Stehpenie Meyer is the best writer ever!|`|Gh0tLUjOaa	First of all, I want to know why Stephen KING (not Speilberg) is going around trashing other people's work. I agree wholeheartedly with his statement about Stephenie Meyer, but let's just face it, J.K. Rowling isn't  exactly the cat's meow either.   I don't know, it just doesn't seem right to me that he's ripping on everyone. And apparently, all those authors he disses must have something to their name, 'cause it sure as hell isn't them going out and buying all those copies of their own books. And notice how the writers he claims have no talent are more popular than those he acclaims?  Now, I understand the difference between popularity and talent. I'm in high school, believe me, there's a lot of idiots walking around here wearing the crown of popularity. Still, they must be doing something right to have some everyone falling to their knees, begging for the next book to be released.|`|AA10676702	All hail Stephen King! (Steven Spielberg eh?) We are not worthy! We are not worthy! Hell yeah!|`|aSwSyjuNaa	Stephen Spielberg is not an author, but a director. I believe you mean Stephen KING?     I believe his words are true. Through all these years King has been a friend of Rowling's, has praised her books a good deal and has admitted that he admired her deeply.     And Meyer? Well, I frankly don't see what there is to admire such an author. Her books are rubbish. Her writing style is horrible and when you read only the first paragraph of Twilight, you'd think the book has been written by either a 5th grader or a teenage fanfiction writer with terrible vocabulary. Meyer uses a Thesaurus; what do you except, then? Her story might seem gripping at first, but after a while you realize it is full of flaws, such as the great absence of a basic, normal plot, physically perfect characters, and no chemistry what so ever between her beloved Eddie and Bells.     Bravo King! I now admire him more than I did before.|`|9WIbZUH0aa	i actually agree with him.  Jo can write wonderfully, and she has great characters with an amazing plot that sucks the reader in.  Her book, like many others, made the best-seller list because of this.  Stephanie, though, only has a great plot--her writing isn't too good.  Her characters, though they could be incredible, fall short because she does not present them to the reader well.  Her book made the best seller list strictly because of plot.|`|TdRgGCJPaa	I actually do agree, completely and totally agree with him.|`|AA10659685	AGREE!!!!    J.K.

Stephen King is the author, not Speilberg (who is a director).    But I adore his honesty. Most people are just fake and can't tell the truth, whereas he just told the public his true emotions.

The heroes of the story certainly have their faults & days when they behave like turds. And the villains are usually shown to have a decent side to them. The only truly bad-to-the-core character was Voldemort ~ who really wasn't even totally human by the time he became Voldemort (which is totally shown by dividing his soul, his snake-like appearance, etc.)  However, Rowling does present him in a much more sympathetic way when she wrote of him as the human, Tom Riddle.

BKTx9IsZaa	he hated himself most of all|`|4PkRRHEtaa	I have read the first few chapters of Mein Kampf (his autobiography) and have also seen a few documentaries, and it seems he hated the Jews for ruining Germany in the first world war, for supporting Communism, and for being too rich.    See, most of the rich folk were Jews. Most of the poor ones were not. So Hitler emerged as a demagogue, feeding on the prejudice and hatred of the destitute, coming to power by promising to penalize the Jews for their sins. Moreover, the Jews, Hitler believed, had betrayed Germany by declaring German surrender in the First World War.    Of course, this was all an excuse for power, and a lie. None of the Jews of the Holocaust deserved such a terrible fate.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	He was insane, and you are leaving out many other groups that were targeted by the Nazis.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	it was a power grab, many jews were rich, so he took their money and property and made his party richer|`|fgRtf9CIaa	I never heard that he hated the JW.

There was a lot of literature circulated before and after Hitler's birth blaming the Jews for everything but hoof and mouth disease, and every piece of writing was based on lies. Hitler wanted a scapegoat so he used the Jews as reason for Germany's defeat in World War 1. The libelous writings were used by Hitler to justify his actions. The J.W. crowd just refused to follow in lock-step to his rantings so he made an example of them.|`|hHePDPncaa	no reason he needed someone to blame problems on so he could get away with anything|`|CCN2PneTaa	I don't know about Jehovah's Witnesses, but I know he used the Jews as a scapegoat for the First World War.|`|yYImFx3Taa	his family had jews in it and i believe they denounced him.

Crazy man but great strategist.|`|3hLrUGcBaa	There are many reasons why Hitler began his terrible reign of terror, mostly focused on Jews, although we should not forget gypsies, those with disabilities etc. Firstly Hitler needed a scapegoat to  blame for the Treaty of Versailles, and he called them the 'Novemeber Criminals'. This justified his means of reversing the Treaty and claming back territory. He had held a hate campaign for many reasons. Dating back to the medeival period Jews have been seen as a minority in society. They were less affected by the Black Death that many other groups and some saw this as witchcraft. During other events in history they have remained a minority and seemingly unaffected (although this is to be debated). They were also intellectuals and prosperous, and Hitler feared their intelligence as it meant they were more critical of hi policies and were more aware to what he was doing i.e. introducing a reign of censorship and terror.     Hope this helps.|`|YfFFzOw1aa	I heard that Hilter was a Jew himself and had black hair and brown eyes, and in his eyes he thought the perfect race had Blond hair and Blue eyes, as a stereo typical jew has brown/black hair and brown eyes he wanted to elminate them, as it would be easier to create the 'perfect' race. I believe that Hilter had a horrible childhood and blamed people like him for it so to give other people a chance he wanted to get rid of people like him, in the end he killed himself as he realised what he had become. i hope this helps

In almost every dream I have, I'm climbing up my staircase. I turn round to see a young person. I'd say under the age of 10, always. Somehow, I know for sure that this child is a ghost. And the child always has cuts and bruises over the parts of it's body that aren't covered by clothes. I was scared of these ghosts, but one night that all changed.    I turned around to see a young girl. Long, blonde hair. It was straight, with a slight wave at the end. She had a middle parting, no fringe. She still had the cuts and bruises, but I gathered all my courage and talked to her. As soon as I did, the cuts and bruises faded.    After that, I dreamed that a peadophile was after me. He'd set up webcams in my house and asked if I could meet up with him. That's when my dream ended.    Maybe my goal is to become a child psychologist or prevent child abuse. It's odd to think now, but I don't really like children and never want to get married or have my own children, but may consider adopting or fostering them.    x

OIRI5Ok7aa	Instead of writing: "Sheila was angry at Bob," write "Sheila threw a coffee cup at Bob and slammed the door on her way out."  Use the person's actions, mannerisms, etc. to portray their emotions and details about their characters so we can figure it out ourselves as readers.    Another example:  Let's say you want us to know that Sheila is a mean woman.  You could have her kick the dog because it won't move out of her way.  We can infer from that action that she is an unpleasant woman, so we don't need to be told that.     Some of the best examples of show don't tell can be found in Hemingway's work.  Check out "Hills Like White Elephants":http://www.has.vcu.edu/eng/we...   Another good one is James Joyce.  Check out "Eveline":http://www.enotes.com/eveline-...

s37fnYJ4aa	Yes and No.    I do think that my pre-mortal choices led to me being born into the family I was born to, and maybe also the talents, strengths and weaknesses that I have.  That family had effects on me above and beyond my choices... (both for good and ill) but my choices affected what those effects did to me/my spirit/my life.    While I did choose to try hard in school, was it really my own choice that led me to be born in a country where schooling is free and of a high standard?  It's possible that my former life led me to deserve such a blessing, but thinking that I am blessed because I deserve it/chose it is an easy path to pride and selfishness.    To say that my choices alone have created who I am is to miss an enormous chunk of the picture.  A large portion of the things I am are subconscious effects from my family and culture.  A lot of that is the result of choices that other people made along the way, even thougsands of years before I was born (as well as the more recent choices of other people).    This leads to the acknowledgement of how much God's guiding hand on (and blessing power given to) humanity has influenced all people's choices to bring about the culmination of His gentle, loving purposes.  Christopher Columbus may not have known the source of his burning desire to find a new land... but many such desires and thoughts to great minds (and us) have been the loving inspiration and interjection of God.    There are so many reasons why I can't consider my own choices as the only reason why I am who I am... and why I am in the circumstances I am in.  I try to rise above the difficulties... which I think we all have (different ones)... but I stumble and fall back into them, again and again.  Like a little child choosing to stand and take first steps, it's not really about the choice, its about making slow and steady progress towards our divine/eternal potential.    We must try to choose the best we can, but we are not truly in control of our own destinies, except inasmuch as we begin to know ourselves and God, and so come to accept the path laid out before us as the best path to tread for greatest happiness of ourselves and others.  Then we know where we are going, and we know Who it is who is blessing us and giving us power to make the choices that will get us where we want to go.    Knowing that we are not really 100% in control of our own destinies allows also for a more compassionate view towards others less fortunate than ourselves, and a greater sense of gratitude and responsibility for helping them.|`|xl6JVATSaa	Life is a simple matter of cause and effect which may be better described and Choice and Consequences.  We all make choice's which impact on both our selves and others which in turn carry their own consequences. Depending on our choices the consequences can be good or bad.

There are two aspects of this thinking that make me uneasy.  The first is hubris: the idea that I am in control of huge material and social forces.  The second is that this reasoning, often well meant and intended to be empowering, is taken by the oppressed and afflicted to mean that their misfortune is their own fault.  There is, however, some merit for me in the idea that your actions can influence how you perceive events.  If, for example, you have cultivated enough good will over a lifetime, you might be able to accept bereavement or sickness with serenity.  But this is certainly beyond me at ghe moment!|`|ji7gqCWxaa	If and when everything was under your total control, then yes.  Otherwise, you are only responsible and liable for whatever you really controlled, ie. chose.|`|KifasiMraa	I think your question needs some rephrasing.  At first it seems like you're asking if the little things that happen in your life are the result of your whole life, which is impossible.  Thats like asking if the part is the result of the whole.  I think what you meant was, are the things that hapen to you now the result of the choices you've made up until that point?    in which case -     I think everything that happens in one's life is somehow the result of a choice by somebody (or a collective someone's),whether it be an isolated choice, or coolective choices made over a period of time (even 1,000 years).     Even if you didn't choose for a storm to hit your house, someone made choices as to how they would treat the environment and eventually those choices resulted in the storm that blew your house down.      You might not choose to get cancer, but you chose to smoke the cigarettes that led to cancer.     You may not choose for someone close to you to die, but their choices may have somehow resulted in their death.  Everything can be traced back to a choice someone or a group of someones made at some point in time.  Saying "Some things just happen for a reason." Actually supports this point though I don't think people use it to mean as such.  When something happens that we can't explain, we say  "God has a plan," or "Its just a coincidence," or any other number of things that justify an event as being out of anyone's control.  It may be some things are beyond our understanding, but that doesn't mean it wasn't the result of choices made by actual people.    I can see where there would be concern when someone might use this to justify the plight of the oppressed.  Saying its their fault is certainly incorrect.  But their oppression is certainly the result of SOMEONE'S choice (being that of their oppressors).|`|f2cQrG7jaa	The choices life has made, sure. I don't know that I've ever chosen anything myself. I don't think of it as a sum total, but rather a completely new sum. We shed the old constantly for the new to take root. I think of it as every second is a compensation for the last, a WHOLE new universe in every second.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Nature is the interaction of my choices and the choices of others.    So no.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	No, some of it is the result of things that are out of your control and didn't have a choice in (environment you were raised in, tragedies that may have happened, etc...)|`|2UnjeOQUaa	I don't see how it could be any other way.|`|3IVqoH16aa	No.  To me, this is the illusion of total control over one's life.  Yes, it is a positive statement and can be a step out of victim-hood, where a person thinks everything is forced upon them and can do nothing to change their situation.  But it is the opposite extreme of victim-hood and is just as untrue.  I believe the truth lies somewhere in the middle, that there are some things we can control and some things we cannot.  For a person to think that every painful thing that happens to them is the result of something they did in the past lays way too heavy a burden of guilt on a person.  We need to take responsibility for our actions.  It's part of being an adult.  But we also need to deny guilt for stuff that's really not our fault.  And it's often times not easy or impossible to know if we are responsible or not.  Accepting that certain things are out of our control is where thankfulness and appreciation come from.  Why be thankful for anything when you can make anything happen that you want, whenever you want?

Iw6vqJd8aa	I don't know how common it was, but the Indians took what they needed, metal knives and guns at first. It was always about the weapons to give them a fighting chance. Then it was other things mirrors, pots and pans, and those things they didn't have. Some of it was to make themselves more like the whites with some tribes others it was as trophies.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Most of a setlers stuff would be no use or value to a native.

251guEfuaa	Girl,<br>  I had kinda the same problem <br>  I thought that I was gonna be the worst in the class, but that's not true!!<br>  "Dance like nobody is watching you".<br>  If you really love to dance you should do it. <br>  I suggest you to take some classes first(the beginning) so you will get chance to learn and practice some basic steps/moves and make some friends!! (You will love it) Everyone is going to be on the same level. Then you can take some privates if you really want to (but they are kinda expensive) Good luck!! keep on dancing!!|`|lWbr1eWIaa	i would go for taking public lessons because at most studios they rather you take private to ENHANCE your public classes. it's also a lot more expensive taking private lessons. if you start in a beginning class it's not very embarrassing because everyone is new and i can guarantee there are lots of people that feel the same way you do. you can go look up a studio and call them and ask to try out a class and see if you like it and if you do sign up and go for it! if you REALLY want to learn to dance, taking classes is the only way to train.|`|yDB2EUbDaa	If you take dance seriously you WILL get in shape! And you can't get good at something until you practice it. And yes they would give you private lessons.|`|sz2SatQ9aa	1st of all private lessons are for people who r already dance and want to get their technique right and be more flexible! but you can ask the teacher if u could! <br>  <br>  2nd of all dont be scared to go! ask ur friend if she wants to go with u and if she doesn't, so wat!! try it out and remember dance lessons are for u to learn how to dance! if u dont like the dance school go to another 1.<br>  <br>  3rd. doesnt matter if ur not in the best shape because dancers are all different sizes!!<br>  <br>  AND YES I THINK ITS HIP-HOP|`|AA12071655	There are two ways:<br>  <br>  #1<br>  You put your right hand in,<br>  You put your right hand out,<br>  You put your right hand in,<br>  And you shake it all about,<br>  <br>  You do the hokey pokey<br>  and you turn yourself around<br>  That what it's all about.<br>  (alternating with different body parts)<br>  <br>  #2<br>  It's just a jump to the left<br>  And then a step to the right<br>  With your hands on your hips<br>  You bring your knees in tight<br>  But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane,<br>  Let's do the Time Warp again!
MWEn7fcwaa	I did a GCSE in dance and didn't enjoy it all that much either. But it is another qualification, so if you can try and stick it out I would. It's a good life lesson in sticking with things even if you're not enjoying them! A lot of GCSEs aren't fun, at least with dance you can get away from the desks and books and get moving and creative.|`|nukcYkR9aa	you made a commitment when u signed up to finish it. you are obligated to go to the GCSE, even if u hate it.     when i signed up for basketball i despised it so much, but my parents told me that i had to do it. and when i did it didnt turn out that bad after all because i was with friends and i focused on having a good time =) good luck!!|`|AA11602010	yes
uoBoo8ouaa	My personal favorite is the New York City Draft Riots of 1863.  Poor immigrants (mostly Irish) were being drafted to fight in a war to "free the slaves" (or so went the Emancipation Proclamation).  Freed slaves just happened to be the immigrants' # 1 competitor for jobs.  The riots were so severe that troops had to be redirected from Gettysburg to help put down the rioters.  <br>  <br>  Surprisingly, the movie "Gangs of New York" actually did a fairly good representation of it.  They managed to explain it pretty well, but the events did not play out 100% the way the movie portrays it.

uh5DlJzqaa	Very emotional poem don' t think I could write it but even though she's emo to she might feel a little creeped out because it kinda has a stalker feel to it a little bit. And if she rejects you that could be a problem because you shouldn't think life sucks if she rejects you. There is plenty of fish in the sea and your only what 14 or 15. So maybe edit it a little bit then give it to her. <br>  <br>  All i'm saying is from a girl perspective maybe don't come off so strong. I love that you're very emo in the poem but it may be to much for her. Just go in kinda as a mystery and once you really get to know her then show her your real emotional side.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know i happen to be in tenth grade and i also liked this guy but he didnt like me back(had nothing in common) and i ended finding someone better with a better personality and sense of humor.|`|RvWmmjWiaa	You might consider relocating to a poor village in Africa and reciting your poem there.

I'm closer than almost anyone on the planet to this one friend, and she just "slammed the door" of our friendship because I gently disagreed about something with her.  We were friends for like 5 years, so it was a long and deep friendship that just got trashed.  <br>  <br>  Don't get your hopes up and get crushed if she can't return your love, because it wouldn't be you she'd reject it would be that she's afraid to be hurt so she pushes even the kindest people away.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Perhaps think of her as a human, a girl, a woman not a "chick".

qP081wfvaa	At that time, the Catholic Church made the people believe that the planets including the sun revolved around the earth. This theory is called Geocentric(revolve around earth) and was thought up by Aristotle. After centuries Galileo proved using Copernicus theory(heliocentric) that the earth did indeed revolve around the sun. This caused a stir because it went against what the church said and as we know people were VERY religious at that time. The court put Galileo on trial for heresy because he proved that the sun was the center of the universe not earth. Other reasons were that it was believed that everything in the universe was pure and had no deformalities since Heaven was up there. But using Galileos telescope he showed people that the moon was not pure but had craters.     hope i helped :)|`|bxlYleZkaa	Because his theory that the sun was at the centre and not the earth different from the church's view.|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	yea cuz his theories contradicted with the church/ Copernicus|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	because he spoke the truth about the Universe|`|1hciyvKdaa	Who am I to deny you reading about an interesting part of history.

His theory that earth moved around the sun, etc., defied religious teaching -- the crime of heresey.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Galileo was an Italian physicist and astronomer credited with building the first effective telescope. He used this to prove that the earth moves round the sun.  This confirmed the theory originally put forward by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus. But it went directly against the teachings of the Church i.e; the earth was the centre of the Universe and the Sun revolved round the Earth.  It was this conflict with the teachings of the Church that was to eventually bring Galileo to the attention of the Inquisition.    In 1609 Galileo heard that a new instrument had been invented in the Netherlands which made objects in the distance seem close to the observer. Galileo tried to create this using a variety of lenses and he soon succeeded in making a basic telescope using a concave and a convex lens at either end of a lead tube. At the third attempt he produced a telescope that made objects appear 1 000 times larger and over thirty times closer than seen with the naked eye. Although Galileo could see the importance of the telescope's aid to navigation at sea and over land, he was most interested in its use to look at the skies.    On 7 January 1610, Galileo observed three very bright objects close to Jupiter. After observing these over a number of nights, he noticed that the pattern changed and a fourth bright object became visible. Galileo explained there were four satellites which revolved about Jupiter and Jupiter and its satellites revolved around the sun.  To Galileo, it followed that the sun must be the centre of the universe.    In March 1610, Galileo published the results of his observations under the title The Starry Messenger. Hundreds of copies were soon printed. Some philosophers such as Kepler, received his work with enthusiasm, but others such as Libri who taught philosophy at Pisa, were far less enthusiastic. Libri actually refused to even look through a telescope. Allegations were made that Galileo's observations were the result of illusions created by the telescope. This may seem a curious reaction, but it was well known that a single lens could distort and if this was the case, the combination of two lens could be regarded with even more suspicion.    In 1612 Galileo published a work titled, Discourse on Floating Bodies, which attacked Aristotelian physics. This resulted in Galileo's own work being challenged in four printed articles.    Galileo was summoned to Rome to face the Inquisition and to stand trial for "grave suspicion of heresy." This charge was grounded on a report that Galileo had been personally ordered in 1616 not to discuss Coperican theory either orally or in writing. Cardinal Bellarmine had died, but Galileo produced a certificate signed by the cardinal stating that Galileo had been subjected to no further restriction than any other Roman Catholic under the 1616 edict. No signed document contradicting this was ever found.  In 1633 Galileo was compelled to abjure and was sentenced to life imprisonment, which was swiftly commuted to house arrest. The Dialogue was ordered to be burned and the sentence against was to be read publicly in every university in Italy. Imprisoned at his farm in the hills surrounding Florence, Galileo's was becoming increasingly frail and his sight was failing. Nevertheless, it was here that he wrote his most important scientific work, Discourses Concering Two New Sciences, which was published in Holland in 1638. Dealing with falling bodies and the path of projectiles it laid the foundations for modern kinematics.  Galileo died in 1642 aged 78.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	because his theory of the universe (sun at center) was different than the church's (earth at center).|`|xoqWnqCHaa	said the sun was the center of the universe catholic church said it was the earth|`|AA11502346	Because he challenged what the Catholic Church taught on astronomy.|`|VkAu2KDdaa	he said the sun was the center of our solar system  but the church said no it was the earth that is in the center  because galileo went against the church it was consider heresy|`|8uJVN1n3aa	Because of the difference between a heliocentric and geocentric universe.|`|tiABWrkeaa	Actually, it's a myth he proved the earth revolved around the sun. He proposed a theory that it did, but couldn't prove using the methods of the time. The equipment need to measure parallax shifts of stars, which would have proven his theory, weren't invented yet. However, he went ahead and proclaimed his theory the truth. We may act and say "Hey, look how stupid people were then," but if someone made the claim they could travel through time and didn't have the equations, let alone a machine, to back it up, we'd dismiss him as well.     Unfortunately, he decides to also state that this provide the Bible wrong. However, one can't read the Bible as completely literal. There's language that's metaphorical as well. Unfortunately, Galileo picked a time just after the Reformation to pick his fight and there were officials in the Catholic Church who weren't in the mood to tolerate him. However, Pope Urban VIII, gave him permission to publish his findings. Galileo again scrwed up by using the Pope as a character that opposed his theory in his work. Literally, biting the hand that feeds him and an example of how Galileo was.He was hurting the very people who could and wanted to help him. This is what lead to the trial    For more information, see the link  The Galileo Controversy  http://www.catholic.com/library/galileo_...

Even if you read the back and it doesn't seem that interesting, please give it a try. It's a story about a girl, Astrid, who grows up in a non-standard household with her mother, Ingrid, (who in the movie, is a photographer but in the book is I believe a poet or actress). Her mother ends up in jail (which is interesting in itself how she gets there) leaving poor Astrid to live in foster care. Each home she goes to changes her life forever in a very bitterly realistic way. When you read it, you become part of it.   If you've seen the movie, it's nothing compared to the book.

Heres the prologue, let me know if you want more...:    Seven Deadly Sinners    Prologue:  When the pavement shatters the rain that plummets to the ground into shards of droplets, I hold my breath and count the seconds. I wish I were the one that shattered on top of the pavement, never to be seen again. When I tell people that, I get flashed that look. That awful side-glance accompanied by twisted frowns and hushed whispers. They are the looks of those who dont know. Those are the people that are ignorant to the trauma Ive gone through and the horror Ive experienced. Being oblivious has that advantage of happiness, I suppose.   The rain was picking up now and I heaved myself up off the bench, pulling my raincoat hood over my face. I listened to my feet as they splashed in the puddles. I swung around the fence and onto the dirt. This used to be my dirt. That bench used to be my dugout. I lifted up my head and the rain brimmed over my hood. I glanced solemnly around the field. There was the mount where I threw my first perfect strike, not a little inside or a little askew to the right.   I walked to first base and halted at the dawn of the orange bag. Half my childhood was spent on this field, either practicing until dawn or pitching until my hands oozed with blood and blisters. I wondered what had happened. Had I just suddenly stopped playing? Oh, wait. I remembered exactly the day I stopped playing. That horrible day my father died was the day I stopped pl-no, Blair, dont let your mind wander off to hell when youre in the middle of heaven.    I dragged my feet to second base. I remembered a day when my best friend, Rachel, had played second. The bases were loaded with two outs, strikes, and balls. The sweat pouring down my face revealed the pressure I was under. I remember standing on the pitchers mound, rocking back and forth on my heels, envisioning the ball smacking the catchers mitt with a thud. I scanned the crowd for my mother who should have been there to watch my soon-to-be victory and cheer with the other enthusiastic parents. I didnt believe it at first when I came to the atrocious conclusion Rebecca had forgotten. Either that or she had chosen her precious alcohol over her daughter. I should have been used to disappointments and letdowns by now, but I wasnt. I shook this memory out of my head.   As I trudged to third base, I thought of the upcoming week. I would never see this field again. Moving to Maine hadnt been on my agenda, but now that my father was gone, nothing was there to block my mother from fleeing. Certainly not I was to stop her. Third base was farther than I recalled it used to be. I saw the familiar red spray painted base line through the mud on the field. My coach hired some snot-nose teenager to do it everyday before we played. Although our team was poor, we had been pretty decent.  I ran now to home plate. My heart thumped against my chest. A mix of tears and rain poured down my face. Thunder ruptured the sky simultaneously to the pounding drums ringing through my ears. I felt like I was losing an invisible game. The game? Life, and when I lost, I lost everything. The life I had now was leaving me to haunt someone else. Now it was my turn to live life from a different perspective and Id smile through the experience even if it killed me, literally.|`|UzJBYk5zaa	It's a tome, but Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell was amazing, I couldn't put it down.

HqcH85SMaa	Unhallowed Ground by Gillian White<br>  On a snowbound February day, when Georgina first saw Furze Pen - a picturesque thatched cottage in a peaceful valley on Dartmoor - she thought it just the place to recover from the recent nightmare of her job in London. True, the cottage was old and isolated, and the neighbours weird and strangely threatening. But Georgie needed to work out her life, and Furze Pen seemed as good as place as any - until the terrors started. There was the lone watcher on the hill - at first she thought it was a scarecrow, so stark and still was it standing - and then the unexplained fire, with the remains of a child's doll smouldeing in the ashes. But there had never been a child at Furze Pen.

However, I really like Nix, so yes I recommend him.<br>  <br>  Evernight by Claudia Gray: Not jumping for joy the best read I've ever read, but not horrible.  The plot was interesting enough though the original mystery is explained away a little too neatly and suddenly. Don't pick this up if you prefer the traditional vampires, it kind of falls into sparkly lovey-dovey vampire territory.  Still I managed to tolerate and even enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Magicians' Guild by Trudi Caravan: Predictable and thus often ignored in an over crowded genre, personally though I still enjoyed it. If you like light high fantasies it wouldn't hurt to pick this one up.<br>  <br>  Hobb's Bargan by Patricia Briggs: I picked this book up because it was from an author I read.  It's nothing like her other books, but it's still good.  This is another high fantasy, but it manages to stay original despite its seemily typical nature.<br>  <br>  Sunshine by Robin McKinley: Dark and edgy, this was not what I was expecting from high fantasy/fairy tale author Robin McKinley.

A lot if songs only use three chords.|`|211LLqtJaa	First, get the best quality, USED, nylon string guitar that you can afford Easier on the hands, easier to play. If buy cheap, nobody will want to buy ot from you if you quit - it is a waste. If you get a decent quality instrument and continue to play, you can keep it... <br>  <br>  Also, get low-tension strings. They have less sound but it will be a lot easier to hold chords, and build endurance.<br>  <br>  You could learn by yourself if you are disciplined enough but it is important to play everyday. Better to play 2 or 3 shorter sessions than try to force a one or two hours practice. Go gradually. Eventually you should take lessons, but take the time to get a teacher that you feel comfortable with.

swlqQ1mYaa	Mmm . . . no. Not most of the civilians, anyways. Japan is a country very bound by societal rules, which included almost unquestioning obedience to authority.

Most people will say your are full of crap for years, then when they see you're right they will turn around and steal your ideas. <br>  <br>  society forces geniuses into modes of employment where they can never turn the genius off. The work you do with your genius mind will cause your thoughts to race unstoppably during your off-time as well. Over the years this makes many a genius utterly miserable. There is a good movie about this, called П (that's Pi, the number) about a brilliant mathemetician who was being pushed by a company to come up with new algorithms to make them money, and finally he took a drill and drilled inside his head to shut his poor brain down.<br>  <br>  True geniuses end up with the weight of the world on their shoulders. To avoid being plugged into a specialty, such as mathematics, or biochemistry, or chess playing, or making violins, or some narrow little niche and wasting it all on nothing like a hamster on a wheel, the truly great minds study everything. They become the "renaissance man." Unfortunately being the renaissance man is even more miserable than being an overworked specialist. Your brain applies itself to every problem the world can throw at you and solves it. People start coming to you for advice. They elect you president. They give you an army and beg you to conquer the enemy. They ask you to explain this, explain that. "let us use your brain" they say. "No, you can't sleep. Give us your brain."<br>  <br>    A common usage of "genius" is someone who does something original that affects society in some profound way. That's exactly the kind of genius who ends up miserable. If you want to be a happy genius, use it for yourself. Apply it to the pursuit of your own happiness, like Jefferson.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Not necessarily and the reason why is because genius is often accompanied by inadequacies and deficiencies in other areas of life. I am speaking more of savants, those individuals who seem extremely gifted in one narrow area - such as being able to do incredible math calculations in their heads, be a musical wizard, etc.  Look at the movie that Russell Crowe did entitled, "A Beautiful Mind."  He portrayed an incredible genius with mathematics and economics and yet his life has always been plagued by severe mental disorder.  Albert Einstein was known to walk out into the snow without his shoes on.  The brain seems to be geared towards doing just one function superbly while all the other every day common functions of living seem to be impaired.  There is a price to be paid, not just in social isolation, rejection, inability to adapt to socialization, function normally in a normal human relationship...for many of these people.  Sometimes, these gifts of genius are accompanied by extraordinary physical handicaps.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure that I would want to trade in my ability to be a balanced and fully developed human being for a narrow but extremely exceptional talent which required being mentally or physically handicapped or a social recluse and misfit.  Such a gift may in fact be a curse to the owner.<br>  <br>  I think there is hope, because most humans only use 5 - 10 percent of their total brain capacity...this means, that the human race has a long way to go in developing it's intelligent capacities.  I think rather than being at the extreme end of the spectrum, I should consider myself to be a little bit above average as a stroke of luck that allows me to have a more fuller life. I wish I could use more of my brain capacity, to increase my intelligence, but at the same time, I am not encouraged by the idea of attendant handicaps if that is the price to be paid.|`|cYKYzuJgaa	Aren't genius and madness commonly the same?<br>  The ability to see beyond the sense of others?<br>  If so, then yes.

Good luck.|`|Yxaht4Cbaa	You will probably get a good grade with this poem. <br>  <br>  The form of your poem is good, but do you really believe the content?  If so, how sad that the "truth" as you see it is marred.<br>  <br>  It is true that there are those who have gone against the Bible and added burdens of donations, indulgences, seizing money, and man-made commandments.  <br>  <br>  The Bible however does none of that, and all the prophecies have come true at their appointed times. There are some remaining ones yet to come, but very few.   There are only 1 or 2 copies of "original copies" of things like the works of Homer and other "great books" that have survived through the ages, but the Bible is supernatural and has withstood the test of time, no matter what government tried to destroy it.   <br>  <br>  When Chinese scholars helped translate the English Bible into the Chinese language they came back to those they were assisting and asked "what is this book... we read other books, but this one reads us."  <br>  Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  <br>  <br>  This means your inter-conscience knows what is right and what is wrong and the Bible will convict you of these truths. <br>  <br>  The Bible says that the physical/natural/scientific world proclaims the existance of God.<br>  <br>   Romans 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead: so that they are without excuse.<br>  <br>  The "preeminent laws" of science were set in place by God... There is a beauty to the logical designs in nature that go against the notion of a world with no absolutes.  With no absolutes, there is no order, no right or wrong or reason to refrain from anything.  If I justify that you are just a pile of interestingly arranged proteins then I can justify that if I feel like turning into someone like Hitler then I can do just about anything including inflicting mass suffering and death on innocent people with no reason not to.<br>  <br>  Be careful not to generalize "Christianity", just like the money in your pocket, any good thing has a counterfeit somewhere trying to pass itself off as the "real thing".<br>  <br>  Keep an open-mind.

HqcH85SMaa	Unhallowed Ground by Gillian White<br>  <br>  On a snowbound February day, when Georgina first saw Furze Pen - a picturesque thatched cottage in a peaceful valley on Dartmoor - she thought it just the place to recover from the recent nightmare of her job in London. True, the cottage was old and isolated, and the neighbours weird and strangely threatening. But Georgie needed to work out her life, and Furze Pen seemed as good as place as any - until the terrors started. There was the lone watcher on the hill - at first she thought it was a scarecrow, so stark and still was it standing - and then the unexplained fire, with the remains of a child's doll smouldeing in the ashes. But there had never been a child at Furze Pen. And as the seasons turned and snow once again blocked off the remote valley, the frightening began in earnest....|`|Gmvldblraa	"Wizard of Earthsea" Ursula la Guin - first of 4 in the series.

The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his wife Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted ensign Iago. Because of its varied themes  racism, love, jealousy and betrayal  Othello remains relevant to the present day and is often performed in professional and community theatres alike.

Marxism and Communism are one of the two most major systems of Government in the world, even today.

There is no way of definitively saying who was the "greatest" whatever that means. It is testing your powers of argument. Just pick one, do your research and make the case pointing out why he was more significant than the other three.     You could. for example, argue that Napoleon had greater lasting impact on European civilisation the way he ruled France. You could say that Marx was more influential because of the global impact of communism (but did it last like Napoleon's structures?) in his name. You could say Bismarck's united Europe's most potentially powerful country and his legacy lead to two world wars and you could argue that Garibaldi's task of unification in Italy was more difficult plus he helped Uruguay to gain independence.|`|FP1l0L25aa	I'd say Karl Marx.|`|44PoKKMmaa	can you say it not any of them, but as it is for history you dont need to agree,  what you have to do is write about all 4 of them and then summarise saying which each achieved|`|eFjy1f2paa	Certainly Napoleon was above Bismark and Garibaldi.

fZdBaMl1aa	Poetry is a way of expressing your deepest feelings. Poetry should make you understand it when you read it. you should wonder about it, cry, laugh, be enlightened, Poetry acts as a channel between what the author feels and what he/she wants the reader to feel. Edgar Allen Poe wrote a poem called Valentine hiding his love's name within the letters. I hope this help with what ever you needed it for!|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Poetry presents the thing in order to convey the feeling. It should be precise about the thing and reticent about the feeling, for as soon as the mind responds and connects with the thing the feeling shows in the words; this is how poetry enters deeply into us. <br>  <br>  ~~Wei T'ai|`|9bSCOZB1aa	Poetry is like any other art; it is a form of self expression, only it is in the form of words.|`|ZSchvX1Yaa	To inspire people who love reading.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	Poetry is a compilation of ones' thoughts, how they feel and view the world about them.<br>  It can be how they feel about themselves and how others view them.<br>  It it is supposed to bring others to a deeper consciousness of things that can enrich their lives.|`|a8i7NGu2aa	I don't know why, but I've always seem to get my strongest feelings out through poetry. To me, I feel that poetry is supposed to be a doorway to the human soul. Its an honest, open, and beautiful expression of the human emotions that seems to make things clearer in an amazing way. I feel that poetry can touch the lives of many people and inspire even more.

ULfGJZaaaa	with existence you can have a impact on others|`|Xxviy63Paa	This isn't a philosophical answer but it's not a philosophical question either.<br>  <br>  If you think it would have to be "argued" that living is preferable to dreamless sleep, you must not value your own experiences or preferences all that much. Whether living is worthwhile is up to each individual, not a matter to be argued over. <br>  <br>  If you would prefer a dreamless sleep, that's not something anyone else is going to argue with. That's why you were given your life to live and everyone else wasn't. Those who prefer living don't need to argue that it's preferable either. Just like if you eat a food that tastes good, you don't have to argue that it tastes good first.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that if your body dies, it isn't going into a state of nonexistence. Nor does the life within your body either. Almost immediately - actually it's already happening, but held in check by your immune system - the living cells that you are a giant community of are consumed by other cells, which take the organic, living matter they contain and use it themselves. Later animals like worms, and maybe vultures or even hyenas do the same thing. At root you are proteins that collaborate to prolong their existence by following a set of rules encoded in your DNA. But just because their community dies, doesn't mean all these proteins die. Most are absorbed by other critters and go on existing. They are the essence of life and it's the real secret behind "eternal life" that religious people get all mystical and woo-woo hocus-pocus about.<br>  <br>  You can't stop evolution from favoring the ones who want to survive and keep their own form of life (their specific DNA) going, at the cost of all others. Those that don't want to do that die out. Oh well. That's nature. That doesn't mean macho values is sufficient though. There are, for people, many other types that evolution has given good survivability too, including fertile women, shamen, inventors, and lazy good-for-nothings who leech off of everyone else. Look at all the lazy people there are in the world today. They must have some kind of advantage if they haven't died out.<br>  <br>  There is also the matter of tribes. Most of human evolution has occurred with people living either alone or in small groups, of at most town or tribe or clan size. Maybe a few thousand. No cities, no states, definitely no nations. You can always count on people in the modern world to march off into a hail of bullets by making them confuse their primeval tribal identity with their country. Especially if your country is a big one like the USA, where most people don't have a tribal identity to speak of. People have this instinct to defend their tribe because in the past it affected their own survival. If the other tribe wasn't defeated, your own tribe would likely be wiped out and their goes your own DNA along with everyone else's. This also was a source for a lot of "good" things like being helpful, charitable, and peaceable to your neighbors. Throwing bad people out of your tribe. Love and laughter and dancing in a circle and rituals and festivals and rites of passage and etc etc. <br>  <br>  You don't need a tribe to have those things. This is just to show that sociobiology isn't just about what you seem to not like, it involves lots of other things you might like better, too. If you live in a big country you probably can't have a tribe, you'll just have to figure out how to get those things being one of millions of people instead.|`|cYKYzuJgaa	Is life better than non existence?|`|tRrzHOCRaa	im not so sure that we truly can argue that in a viable way as untill experienced we truly dont know which is better...but as we cannot return if we choose to experience death we tend to resist based on not knowing.so instead we focus on reasons we wish to continue our experience of life! and as for the values it is a fact of life that we are somewhat selfish etc.whether we disagree or not!!! is it not selfish to eat a meal when a child across the world starves...but can we truly help the child if we choose to send the food and starve ourselves...you see life is a balancing act and we are all selfish as we are all selfless..a healthy individual is 50/50 then there are the weak who are over selfless and then the agressors whom are overselfish and they are a drain" so true success whether moral or physical or financial etc.is finding the balance point and living there!

If you have no expectations, you cannot be disappointed.<br>  <br>  You can always choose to quit.<br>  <br>  If it a school thing, then use your opportunity in "lighting" to help you learn more about the entire craft and all that goes into it...it is an opportunity.<br>  <br>  Your point of view on things determines how far you will go. It is all on what one chooses to focus. We make ourselves happy or we make ourselves miserable, the amount of work is exactly the same.<br>  <br>  A crappy attitude and resistance to your assigned role (job), will only serve to land you other crappy roles. Outwardly showing contempt or disdain for the director won't land you any favor.<br>  <br>  Even though your opinion of yourself and your abilities is very high, I would suggest you talk with whoever made the assignements and ask what you could have done to land one of the acting roles. What did they see that they thought you need to work on. turn it into a learning experience rather than an emotional issue.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Use the LDK to turn poison to medicine.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Ask your teacher to explain how she discovered the cheating and tell her why, she will understand.|`|FROVo8WWaa	TONIGHT YOU SLEEP WITH THE FISHES (an old movie quote)|`|Iu7yCzssaa	thats so petty! why should you care what they think?  if you know you didnt snitch then just relax! why get all hyped for things out of your control.... there are worse things in life than this .... get over it! it aint that deep!
i1gesbh5aa	1984 for sure.  Brave New World was boring in my opinion.|`|SzsrajV4aa	I enjoyed 1984 when I did a paper on it in High School.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	1984 is wonderful. I started reading Brave New World, but it just didn't hold my attention. I have never read the Anthem.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	1984 was TOTALLY good. Read it. You will seriously love it. For a required reading, it was actually very decent.<br>  <br>  I haven't read either of the other ones, but I've heard some stories about why "Brave New World" is a sucky one to read. <br>  <br>  If I were you, read Orwell. The man's a genius.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Yes - all three.    The Anthem is the most difficult - but rewarding if you persevere.   The other two are easy reads and very different versions of the future as imagined by the two authors.|`|NSi0xTQ0aa	yea really good books, great for philosophy. i personally liked anthem better but the other is not bad too|`|fy5gKCVZaa	I love 1984, and I've heard good things about Brave New World|`|vKFneEuIaa	In my opinion all three are good and interesting. 1984 is probably the best known and widely read of the three, but all three are definitely classics.|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	I've read the last two and liked both. The author of The Anthem is Ayn Rand, not Amy, and her books are tougher reading. 1984 is probably the easiest to read.|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	I read 1984. It is interesting if you take into consideration the time it was written and definitely gives you something to think about when you finish.|`|IK5PoN4Laa	I have read the anthem and 1984 and I can say both of those are very good books.  I would read all three of them.  I hear Brave New World is quite good.|`|AxGFz6qQaa	No, but I've heard good things about 1984.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	1984 is a good one so is Animal Farm by Orwell as well|`|AA10334348	The Anthem-- awesome story, but ending too brief<br>  1984... o boy... my favorite book of all time, how can I not know it???|`|TDfuhLPQaa	i have read 1984 for a class actually.  Its a good book if you are into history and governements.  What is interesting about this book, is a lot of things that happen in the book, actually happen in real life.  its amazing how many things parallel and is actually kinda of creepy.  it was okay...its a classic..but wasn't my favorite.|`|E0xuQFFnaa	I read brave new world and 1984 in my AP english class in High school I hated both because they were too weird. If you want to learn alittle about them I suggest you read cliffnotes.com or sparknotes.com it will give you an overview of both. I am a female so that may have something to do w/ it.|`|PPW3Yo2Daa	I read 1984 and I'm halfway through Brave New World.<br>  They are both awesome.|`|dBS6a7nXaa	nopes.|`|0a92a06fb2c7565638777b7ba8574ec0aa	All of them I've read.<br>  <br>  Read the last two. Rand... I'm not even going there.|`|oXRZfAWaaa	I have only read Anthem, but I loved it...  one of my fave books.
9NpXU7D2aa	stephanie meyer said she isn't going to finish it. <br>  you can read why and read the first 264 pages which is all there is going to be according to her on her website.<br>  <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsu...</a>|`|OnNJoKdlaa	I read an article, saying she's going to start writing it again in 4 years(and she said that herself). But, according to my sources she's probably already finished writing the rest of the rough draft. But, so far no information from a credible source right now. So I guess were just gonna have to wait. :(|`|nXojcf2Caa	" It will take a while, because I can only work on it between editing stints, but I hope that someday I'll be able to see Midnight Sun on the bookstore shelves next to Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and etc... "<br>  <br>  "June 2008 Update: In response to the outrageous number of emails that I have received with questions concerning Midnight Sun, I talked to Stephenie this weekend and she asked me to let everyone know that Midnight Sun is her next project. She has not yet finished writing it (and there is no timeline set up, so we all need to put a lot of effort into being patient for a while longer), but she is definitely still planning on having it published. And, after Breaking Dawn comes out, Stephenie will have much more time to focus on writing Midnight Sun. "<br>  <br>  go onto stephenie meyer's website (link below) and check out in depth what she has to say about the leaking of the partial draft, publishing, etc. there is also a section of the book availabe at that link too, which you can download.|`|AN02OYPlaa	She's taking a break from it. There is no release date at the moment. She's working on a different story right now.
TDBpYyuPaa	Most other dancers won't care if you strip naked in front of them.  They're used to it.<br>  <br>  If you feel embarrassed about it though, you can wear a pair of tan tights underneath whatever tights you are supposed to wear that you need to change (this only works if you're wearing tights of course, I don't know if you are dancing without tights).  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	duck into bathroom and change there|`|sz2SatQ9aa	dont be embarrassed!! i do it all the time and if ur scared get ur mum to hold a towel or somfin in front of u!!<br>  <br>  its almost all girls there anyway so dont b embarrased!!<br>  <br>  I LUV DANCING!<br>  <br>  p.s if ur scared think in ur mind "i'm so sexy and so hot!! i've got tha hottest body in da world! every1 likes me"|`|m33uUyRYaa	why doesn't your team get nude bodysuits to wear under everything? and why would you take off your tights shouldn't you wear them all dances of if your putting on like leggings or fishnets over them? thats what is usually done but anyway i've been going to comp. for 9 yrs now and my team wears nude bodysuits so i dont worry about that but other teams don't and they just strip seriously and some girls will like sit there naked its kinda wierd but im used to it don't worry everyone will be changing not looking at you.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	A good way is to tie a jumper around your waist and turn around against a wall (so no-one can see) and strip off your bottoms that way. If you can it is also good to go to a bathroom. You can also wear things underneath that can't be seen under your costume.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your comp  :)|`|0sTvM6gKaa	Don't be embarassed, you're all girls (most likely) and a great number of the other girls will probably be doing the same if they're in more than one number. My first competition is coming up in a week and i'll have to deal with the same thing, but at my recitals that's what we always do. nobody's really ashamed because they're more concentrated on getting changed & ready more so than what everyone else is doing.<br>  hope i helped =)|`|a9iTYbrNaa	AHAHAH! it's not embarassing, youll find most of the dancers dont care. i have been dancing for 10 years now and i just strip. everyone does it. but if your that sensitive go hide in a corner and do it (i did that the first 2 years) ahahaha lol:)<br>  hope i helped!|`|mY4Ex0ogaa	put a skirt on, and just change them from under the skirt. (practice in front of a mirror at home first, it's not that hard to get it right, without anyone seeing anything)|`|ajKczHOHaa	Just taking off the tights?<br>  Alls you have to do is pull half of the tights off one leg, then pull it through your leo and take it off the other leg.
QAwKWFKFaa	It may mean that it will always remain fresh in people's mind forever you know.<br>  A child of all time, meaning that however much time pass, they're still there, still young, still there to stay.|`|G2OdDlmjaa	im guessing they are part of the past because they are dieing present because they are still some what there and future because they will still be there in seconds to come?|`|nnkeYZqZaa	<a href="http://answeringall.mooretolife.net" rel="nofollow">http://answeringall.mooretolife.net</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check
