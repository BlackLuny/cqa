20090203115009AA0iPJ0	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	Problem with signal quality on a Sky dish?	The signal quality is rather lower than it used to be on my Sky dish. I had some work done on my chimney stack recently and I think the quad LNB may have been knocked. The signal strength is nearly to the end of the scale but the quality is only about a quarter. This causes problems when the weather is bad. Would a minor adjustment of the LNB improve the signal quality? In the alternate, would Sky come and fix it? It was a recent upgrade to Sky HD, but obviously I would tell them that the work on the stack was done before they came and fitted the new LNB.

20090222211005AApXEN8	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	I need help finding a camcorder!  Cinematographers help!!!?	Please help me find a camera that meets my needs!!!      1. Very crisp and clear video   2. Lots of mega pixels (7mp sounds good)   3. Fast shutter speed (will be recording objects going at least 100mph)   4. can have swap-able lenses (I need 10mm and 35mm and a really good telephoto lens)   5. automatic focusing and manual   6. durable (it will probably go though a maximum of 250mph winds)   7. has minimum frame rate of 30p but more would be nice   8. at least 1920x1080 resolution HD   9. adjust from dark to light places well   10. films well in bright and low lighting      As you can probably tell I can't use a typical camcorder from wal-mart, I need something that professional cinematographers would use.  If any of you know of any good video camera's that are good for me please tell, and even if they don't meet all wanted specifications please tell anyway.      Thanks

20090222215144AA7ZmTd	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Would you buy the Canon SD790 IS now?	I am looking for a camera I can keep with me at all times.   I'm a photographer for my school newspaper (college paper) and I want to have a good cam with me when I'm not carrying my SLR.        Ken Rockwell recommends the SD880 IS.  That's about $250.  I kind of like the SD790, which is only $150 and apparently takes great pics.  Difference? 28mm lens on the 880 vs 35mm on the 790.  Also, Digic 3 on 790 vs digic 4 on 880.        What to do? I'm almost afraid to drop $250 on a camera, the technology moves so fast soon even the 880 will be outdated, and I will have spent that extra hundred for the latest and greatest when I might not have had to.   I am willing to pay more if it is worth it though.   Thoughts?

20090222210252AAw8bIC	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Sony kdf-e55a20 video goes black?	DVR and DVD is connected to tv by hdmi. Watching tv and video goes black and audio drops off. Video and audio come back after about 30 seconds. This does this about every 1-2 minutes. It just started tonight. I have the original lamp installed. TV is almost 3 years old now. Even though the lamp replacement light is not blinking on the TV, is the lamp needing replaced?  I had both dvr and dvd running into an A/V receiver when this problem started. I first thought it was the receiver so I connected the dvr and dvd seperately to the tv via hdmi and the problem continues. The only difference is that when either component is connected to the tv directly, when the video goes black, the audio drops off. when either component is connected through the A/V receiver to the tv, the audio doesn't drop off when the video drops off.

20090222220623AApnTcJ	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Ipod Headphones question?	Hey guys, I stupidly left my ipod headphones in the washing machine then in the dryer. I immediately realised that the headphones were in there half way through the drying process.       I took them out and checked if they were alright, They were.... But the sound is TERRIBLE now. Luckily, Ipod replaces the headphones for me since I only bought my iPod couple of months ago (the warranty will last till end of this year).      But I'm wondering, Is it safe to use these headphones on my iPod? My iPod hasn't got any contact with water, so is it safe for me to use the headphones with it?      Please help.      Thanks :)

Leí que se puede agregar o cambiar de banda en un telefono, ya que los fabricantes los hacen aptos para las 4 bandas, aunque las compa?ías los limitan a solo unas con el software que les instalan. Esto es realmente cierto ?    Cómo se le puede hacer para "abrir" el celular a las 4 bandas?    (y que funcione en todo el mundo)      gracias

Hola quisiera saber de usuarios telcel    1.- cual es actualmente el plan tarifario más económico con el que cuenta telcel, y sus beneficios   2.- también si es cierto que si comprando un equipo en amigo kit y después solicitando un plan te libras de los plazos forzosos a los que te obligas en tener el plan tarifario, osea, que cuando quieras te puedes regresar a prepago sin penalización.   3.- si en plan tarifario es posible conservar el mismo número que en prepago y si sí existe algo que se llama "plan mix" donde según esto tienes un plan tarifario que cuando te terminas tus minutos asignados puedes recargar tiempo aire con una tarjeta prepago   4.- es posible "liberar" (acerlo apto para que funcione con la sim card de cualquier compa?ía) un equipo de plan tarifario?       gracias

Quiero cambiar de tel, y tengo dudas sobre cual es la mejor opción, entre  motorola (L6) y sony ericsson (z530, z310).   de el L6 he escuchado que la bateria no le dura mucho, ni siquiera lo que le promocionan, y que además son tan delicados que se truenan con meterlos al bolsillo del pantalón, y que al menor zangoloteo se les descomponen las bocinas.   los sony ericsson tienen mas capacidad en memoria, pero tienen tendencia a que salgan defectuosos del software, o con algun defecto de fabrica que haga que te lo tengan que cambiar.   en resumen, cual telefono me recomiendan teniendo en cuenta precio, calidad en recepción y se?al, si es aguantador, bateria..   o hay que otra recomendacion en modelo y marca me pueden hacer      gracias      no me interesa para escuchar musica ni video de entretenimiento xq ya tengo un aparato para eso

I am a salesperson and am on the road 6-8 hours a day in (relatively) unfamiliar cities.

The battery life would have to be about 8 hours because that is how long my trips are.   I have to pay for it myself (company is not reimbursing me) so the best system for the cheapest price is what I'm really looking for.        Can someone recommend a brand and/or model?  Thanks!
