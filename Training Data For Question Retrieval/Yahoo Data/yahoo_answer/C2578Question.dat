I filled up yesterday for $23 and i hit my trip to see how bad it really was and i have a 1/4 tank of fuel left and my trip is reading I only put on 92 miles so far. so ill be lucky if i get 150 miles out of a full tank my last car was a 2007 pontiac G6 and it got near 500 miles to a full tank i dont understand. I mean i know its older but 350 miles less just seems strange. Any ideas for me to check would be good thanks.

Hi guys I have a s-10 extended cab from 1993 and I am going to be puting new speakers into it. I have discovered many problems such as...the front speakers which are a 4x6 need to have a speaker magnet that is a low enough profile to fit between the top of the dash and the guage cluster. Now this is a 2 part question. If you can name a pair of speakers that are good quaility and that will fit in the dash you get the first part of the question right. The second issue I have is what kind of speakers I am going to place in the rear. The speakers are a 4X10 which is a very poor quiality speaker. All i need to know is if it is okay to slap in annother pair of 4x6's. (bonus if you can tell me the best way to get supreme ground with the rewiring of the speakers)      Thanks all and i hope we can work this out.

20090304233825AAD9opC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Paint Swirl Marks, spider web scratches and Minor Scratches?	Let me start off by saying that I am not a paint expert, so if any terminology I use isn't correct, feel free to correct it.      Here it goes:      I bought a new car about 7 months ago. The paint issues started the day I got it. When the dealership detail my car at their shop, I noticed very light scratches in the clear coat all around the car. I brought it to their attention and they offered to 'buff' it out. I figured since they didn't do it right the first time I wasn't going to take the chance of them making it worse.       Second, I got in a car accident two months ago. I get the car back from the auto body shop cleaned and detailed. I looked over it quickly and was on my way. Then I took the car through a touch less car wash a couple of days ago to get all of the salt off it from the roads. That is when I noticed EXTREME swirl marks and spider scratches, also several deeper scratches I never had before. I'm guessing I didn't noticed it right away when I got my car back because it was cloudy and they waxed it. The swirl marks aren't deep but they are extensive, all over the car and very close and a lot of them. For example, when the sun hits it the right way I can see the hundreds of spider web looking marks, all over. I have a BLACK car so this is all very noticeable to me because I always look at my car. So, my question to you is, what steps, products, procedures, etc. do I have to perform to eliminate, hide, or reduce the appearance of these fine swirl marks. Also, for the deeper scratches what can be used? Which products will I need to purchase, and the best way to do it. Is it possible to eliminate the swirl marks, or minimize them as much possible?         Any help will be greatly appreciated.      Thank you.

20090305001016AALFgt3	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	What can I do about slippy gears on a 1994 Honda Accord Wagon? Transmission flush?	The transmission is there, all gears work, but it's having trouble shifting. Sometimes during shifting, it doesn't fall on to the next gear and the revs go up as if it slipped. The best way to help it is to ease of the gas when it's about to switch to the next gear. I noticed the gears shift better when the car is colder and has been parked overnight. However the problem comes back if I need to go faster and the RPMs are higher, and when I get off the highway where I've been cruising on 4th gear for over 20 minutes.      Went to the auto-part looking for transmission fluid thinking it was needed. The auto-part specialist said it might be metal residue in the gearbox mixed with old pasty transmission fluid that makes it slip, not letting the transmission fall into gear. He told me not to use anything "not Honda quality" or additives at all. Instead he recommended a "transmission flush" before I start panicking about a very costly new transmission.      I'm aware the prices for a transmission flush go from $75 to $200 depending on the car make and model. This is a high mileage car at 50k+. Should this also be a consideration?      This 16 year old car has been with me half it's life and it's been very good to me. Saves gas and the wagon design is great to haul stuff. It's taken me many places and taken me to the same place many times. I really can not sell it to buy another one at the moment.

And before you suggest the larger 1000 V-Strom, that's out of my price range.

I want to be able to pay the $100.00 a month payment as stated above , then when I find a job , I want to pay it off quicker.I do not want the extra payments I send in to just go towards the interest.

20090305001533AAycHWt	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Motor (auto) mechanic - thoughts?	I've been thinking over a few potential career paths and so far I've been considering a career (possibly apprenticeship?) as a motor mechanic. Don't mind dirty/physically demanding work too much, like working with my hands (generally), love solving problems/thinking, mediocre maths skills, not too worried about pay. Right now I'm planning on trying to get some work experience/volunteer work, or simply tag along in a garage, to see what I can learn and see if I enjoy it. But I've got a few concerns:      1) I know absolutely *nothing* about cars, only recently have I taken an interest in them. Will this be a major problem?      2) I'm worried that if I go through college my skills will soon become redundant, especially with the rate technology is advancing; having to learn about all this new technology and electronics will be a pain. Thoughts?      3) Could you provide some examples where mathematics will come in handy in mechanics? Will I have to dust off my mathematics skills a lot?
20090305015057AAxtaGh	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Had repairs done at a Saturn Dealership?	I have a 2003 Mercury Mountaineer, back in December, it started running funny. I figured maybe the fuel filter was stopped up (it is a Flex Fuel). I called the place where I bought it and took it in for an oil change. They opened my hood and discovered that I had 2 holes in my air intake. They said the repair would cost $700. I didn't have the money to do it just then, so I took it home and waited for tax check to come back. Now, my question is this...I found out that this was supposed to be warranty work...can I ask them for a refund because they never bothered to call a Ford Dealership and check and because I had to have more work done to it, or am i outta luck?

I was on a dual carriageway and 6 cars in front of me had to slam their brakes on due to a girl stopping in the inside lane with a  flat tyre, she had already driven for about 500 yards on it and there was a sliproad about 200 yards ahead of her. she made no effort to get her car off the road and onto the 15 foot wide grass verge and was sat in her car with the radio blaring and her engine running.    I was behind a high sided 3 ton mercedes sprinter and hit him at nearly 60 mph. My insurance company are saying I am at fault, in normal circumstances I could accept that, but the traffic police woman at the scene stated to the girl if it had been a fatality she would be up on a manslaughter charge. So why is she not responsible if nobody died???
20090305015207AA9vIVO	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	Should I a buy a 97' Jetta with 200k miles?	Someone is offering me a 97' Jetta that is in perfect condition. One original owner. Interior/Exterior in perfect condition. Regularly maintained (oil changed, new tires, etc.) It has never had any damage and never needed a big repair. The ONLY hang up is that it has just hit the 200k miles mark. What do you think? How long do Jetta engines last when well maintained?       PLEASE don't answer if your answer consists of "engines typically last 200k miles so don't get it" I'm looking for an informed answer specific to the 97' Jetta.       Thanks!

20090305025923AAqH1xO	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	American Family Insurance?	Hey Guys,    I was wondering has any one ever gotten into an accident with someone who had American Family Insurance. The reason I asked is a few months ago my fiance and I got into a car accident and the person who hit us has an American Family Insurance and we are about to settle with them and I wanted to know if any one ever gotten their asking price in a settlement such as the whole full amount.   See the person who hit us was cited a ticket for failing to yield at a stop sign because of their reckless driving  i was rushed to the hospital and went through so many treatments that now im finally finished with all of my treatments and checkup it's time for my fiance and i to settle. I was wondering though, if our asking price will be granted. we asked for 30,000 because my bills alone ended up being very pricey, and aside from the bills the accident really changed my life around. I am no longer working because of this and our finances has mainly been put into getting us a new car and the fact i don't have medical insurance I have been paying straight out of my pocket for my treatments. Before the accident though I had health insurance which was under my parents since im still going to school well college but my dad dropped me because he forgot that i was going to school so now that the accident happen during the time i was taken off from my health insurance i have been going through a huge financial crisis because someones reckless driving.    So my question is have you gotten your asking price for your settlement with American Family Insurance???? if so please share with me......         Thanks, sorry i didn't make sense. haha!
