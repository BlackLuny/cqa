20070919143020AAJ2Mva	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I don't feel like myself anymore?	Okay I haven't been feeling good for the past couple months.  I have headaches and I went to the doctor and they just say that I have migraines.  Well now my whole body hurts.  My legs ache, my stomach has horrible pains in it, and now my left shoulder really hurts.  I get pains around my heart and last night I thought I was gonna just pass out.  I am only 21 years old and I don't know whats wrong, I don't feel like I can live my life to the fullest.  I am always tired and never have any energy.  I also have an ingrown toenail and I was wondering if that could be my problem.  Can it cause me to have headaches and everything else thats wrong with me.  I am scared of going to the doctor, what if they can't fix me?  I just need some advice and some encouragement.  I thought about going to the hospital because I just don't feel good anymore and am sick of going to the stupid family doctor all the time because I never feel good.  Thanks for reading.

The apartement was always cold(in the basement) even if the heat was turned up.Everytime you cooked the smoke alarm would go off. The people who lived upstairs made a lot of noise. Sometimes so much that my pictures would fall off the wall. The crazy thing is I moved out of there today becuase I was laid off from my job,and I miss the place. I am back at my parents house. My parents are ok and we get along. That is not the problem. I just miss the apartment. I find it sad that i wont be going to the apartment anymore. I even miss the crap oven we had.

20090131103648AA95Vvs	Health;Women's Health	Bleeding and cystitis after sex?	Hi - I'm seeing my doctor about this on monday, but was just wondering if anyone here could shed light on it meanwhile...      I had sex (with a condom) a couple of nights ago. It was pretty painful and there was some fresh-looking bleeding immediately afterwards, and it burned when I urinated. The next day it was still sore in that area and urinating was uncomfortable, but the bleeding seemed to have calmed down, so I assumed it had just been a result of trauma to the area. However, the day after that the fresh bleeding was back with a vengeance, complete with the clots you get with a period. My period isn't due for another week or so, when I finish my pack of pills (which I have been taking correctly).       So, I'm not really sure what to think. Could the uterus lining have been pushed out early because of the movement down there? Is the blood just from injury? Or could it be a sign of something? And should I carry on taking the pill as normal?       Thanks very much in advance for (sensible) answers!

I talk to them all online or texting, except for 3 of them i also flirt with in person. It is so hard because i feel a little connection to all of the 7. They all like me, or appear to, and none of them know that i have a secret of flirting with other guys too. Its so hard on me. I feel horrible and i want to stop flirting with them all. I really like the 3 seniors the most, but i know that i could never get with them or do anything with them, cuz they're seniors and im a sophomore, even though they keep pursuing me. im in a tough spot and this is eating me apart inside.      i hope some of that makes sense.

Also, the pimples are healing, but I don't think I'm doing all that I can to help the healing process...I've been putting honey on them for a few hours, also garlic, I've been moisturizing, also using tea tree oil. Tonight I have a really important party (as much as a party can be important) and I really don't want to go all caked up, and even more..when i put make up on it does look cakie and fake.

The job I am seeking is for recruiting new clients, signing people up, and encouraging people to want to lose weight and get into the shape they want.       See, I love to exercise, but don't do enough of it. I use to have a gym membership and went just about every day but that was a while back. I'm overweight for my height because I am very small in size and body frame. I want to lose weight and think this job will be the perfect oppurtunity to do so........but the problem is....I had a friend who use to work at a fitness club as the front desk girl and she was laid off because the boss thought she was too fat.       Now, that's really mean and I hope it is not true, and that's the only reason they let her go.       But if I get this job, I want to lose weight and will because I will ever have exercise/cardio equipment at my fingertips. I just don't want to give off a bad impression if my interviewer thinks I won't be good for the job because I'm overweight.....      The job requires people skills, great communication, and experience in customer service. I have all those and then some...I just hope that will be enough. Do you think I should also say in the interview that I want to change and do the right thing by my body and lose the weight?      Answers welcomed!

There are so many things that are causing the stress 1) The heavy workload is making me really unmotivated to study 2) Compared to when I was studying for my diploma, my grades have slipped which is really demoralising though I studied quite hard 3) Why other students find it easy to cope while I am struggling 4) I have been pushing myself hard all these years and I don't want to fail 5) My parents have always placed high hopes on me and want me to succeed, they have also compared me with bright students and said if they can so can I.

20090131131430AASBrZF	Health;Women's Health	If anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!?	2 days ago... I remember feeling perfectly fine. My body felt great, I had no trouble in doing simple things... it was great. Someone made me angry, another person made me upset to the point where I was going to cry. I didn't cry. I don't cry. I usually hold in my emotions and things like that.   Anyway, yesterday I went to exercise. I walked for 30 minutes, usually very minor for me. All of a sudden, I felt some sort of pull by my heart. It was quick. It was strange. I felt it several times yesterday. I did not feel any chest pain. It felt as though my heart was struggling to pump properly. I went to sleep and felt great. I rested all day into today. When I went to take a shower this morning, I felt a pull again. I must have felt it around 3-4 times (not as much as yesterday).    Now, I'm sitting in the chair and I feel better than ever (no pulls, no awkwardness, nothing). What could be my problem?      The more I rest, the better I feel, but the more I'm unable to do things.      I think about silly things and at times I'm unable to control my thoughts. I notice when I think about things, this happens to my chest. I cannot control my thoughts for some reason. I end up worry about my heart or my lungs, which makes it worse.      I'm sorry for sounding so confused. If anyone can help me, I'd greatly appreciate it. Even if you have no advice, it's still appreciated.       Thank you.      P.S. - Always been healthy...

20090131114113AAiAMFv	Health;Other - Health	Ever since November 5, 2008,...?	I have been cutting back my in take of food and exercising a lot more. I lost weight: from 136 to 109 on January 15th. Then, about the day after, the 16th, I got this uncontrollable rage of hunger. I ate thousands of calories that day, and then I got sick because I ate too much. During the few days after that, I was fine and did not overeat, but then, it happened again. I got so hungry last weekend my body forced the food out of me both ways. After that, I have had diarrhea for the past week. Every time I eat even healthy meals, my body wants to get rid of it. I really don't know what to do. I don't consider myself bulimic or anorexic, but does my body think this? Am I doing this to myself subconsciously?

About two and a half years ago, I had a car accident.They took an MRI scan of my abdomen to see if I had internal bleeding, and to my surprise, the doctor told me that I had PCOS because there were several little cysts on my ovary, and that I would have a hard time conceiving,not impossible, but I would have to undergo fertility treatments. I went to my OB-Gyn a couple of months ago, because I'm ttc and I told him that they told me that I had PCOS. He did tests and an ultrasound that told me that I didn't have PCOS, that I had a cyst on my right ovary the size of a lime. I have had the same problem with my right ovary for the last couple of years.My question is...I don't know who to believe, because I'm getting two different answers..Has this ever happened to anyone before, and what should I do???This was my first time hearing about PCOS.Thanks...

She doesn't eat breakfast, or lunch (she's always *full*) and eats a small meal with her family, and she never eats much at dinner because she ate such a *big* lunch.    I'm worried about her- she's 115 and 5 foot 6- she's not deathly skinny but she's pretty tiny, and if she keeps going, she'll look really ill/be really ill.   I'm worried something I said made her anorexic. When she was like 140 pounds I poked her stomach and called her my chubby bunny. She got so pissed off (her tummy was pudgy, but by no means fat!!! and I LIKED it that way! It was supposed to be a compliment!) and now she won't stop. I told her parents and they said they thought it was good she was trying to become healthier and lose the extra weight BUT SHE WAS NEVER FAT!!! and even if so, this is by no means healthy.    I told her yesterday "you've lost all your fat, so can you stop now?" and she was all offended yelling "SO I WAS FAT??!" and such.      This whole thing is draining me- everything I say is wrong, I feel like I'm just making it worse. She told me to go on a diet (I'm 170 and 5 foot 9) which I think is pretty ok, but she always says how it's a bmi of 25.1 and anything over 25 is overweight.   I'm so sickkk of it.   advice?

20060627222830AATC4WT	Health;Women's Health	Regarding tampon use?	I am 25 years old and when I first started getting my period I was in grade 4, I only had my mom's think pads around when I started, I still use pads but prefer the thin ones. I tried using different styles of tampons and it seems no matter what I try or how I insert one I can still feel it. I have a shorter vaginal canal but it usually feel like it is going to fall out when I sit down and I can feel it no matter how I move, sit or stand. Does anyone have any suggestions. I missed out on swimming with my husband, son and in-laws a few weeks ago because I was on my period and go figure it ended the day after everyone went swimming. I want to get my son in for swimming lessons and swim when I want to, not when my period dictates.

I'm 20 and I love my job (In a legal office)  but I fear I may be becoming depressed.  I'm trying to put on a brave face at work, because others are in the same position too.      But when I come home at night I'm having something small to eat and then going to bed.  But I'm getting up during the night and sobbing so much it hurts, and then crying myself to sleep.

20090131132917AAVQ4VG	Health;Women's Health	Period / Birth Control problems?!?	So I started birthcontrol about almost a month now. I was put on it, because I've been having irregular periods for 5 years. The doctor told me I should start my period on the 4th week (the white colored pills). I was only on the 3rd week ones, and I've started my period. All the periods I've had before were very very light, and only lasted about 1-2 days. Now, and sorry if this is too much information.. But now it's VERY heavy. I'm changing my pad every hour atleast and it's like big clots. I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to go, hence the periods i've had in the last 5 years we're just spots here and there. Should I be worried or contact my doctor?   & sorry again for the details. lol.      thank youu.

20081019152649AAJDeXE	Health;Dental	Is this a good sign?! Please read (sorry its long)?	Hi,   4 days ago I had a root canal done on my front tooth because I had an abscess. She said it all went fine and sent me home until a weeks time when she would replace the temporary filling.      Well the next day I was in a lot of pain so I went back and she banged on the tooth and when I hit the ceiling with the pain she said its probably got infected further up.       She gave me 5 days of 250mg strength Amoxyllin and said if they dont work she may have to take it out.      Well I have 1 day left to take and until today they made no difference to the pain. I have been nearly in tears for the 3 days since - convinced that because they werent working I would have to have it out and I am terrified (and hormonal!)      But today it feels slightly better - I still cant bite on it as it kills me but before even if my lip pressed against it it would be agony but it feels a little better today.      I only have 1 days tablets left and do not think that after them it will be better completely but I think it would have definately improved.      My question is - if I go back will she think that the tablets having worked a little bit as a good sign and maybe give me another course of stronger ones or will she just say "it hasnt gone completely so lets pull out your tooth!"??      Does it mean that I may keep my tooth and just need stronger pills as these have worked a little?      Sorry its so long but I am so scared of dentists due to a bad experience that took place as a child whilst having a tooth out and my hormones have made me even more panicky!      Any opinions would be appreciated.

I didn't really believe it at first when my girlfriend told me, but then I saw it more times, so now I'm curious.   I think it's because since breasts are mainly fat cells, since you eat salad, you don't get nearly as much fat as a regular meal, so, in time, the fat cells shrink, which makes the breasts smaller...

20081023121305AAtkRN2	Health;Men's Health	Can you advise me on a sinus issue?	Usually when I wake up in the morning I'm only breathing through 1 nostril. I can't breathe through my mouth when I sleep because I drool and wake up at night with a dry mouth. So I breathe through my nose. The trouble is one nostril gets completely blocked as if shut inside. I think it depends on which side I turn to when I sleep but it's not always the same nostril. I usually wake up at night to use the toilet and I've heard that this might be a symptom of sleep apnoea. So I'm wondering if my nostril shutting is inhibiting my breathing at night. In the morning it doesn't open until I stand up and start moving around. If I'm lying in bed and block the nostril that's working ok, I cannot breathe through the other. Can you advise me on how I might deal with this?

20081016220741AAE5byh	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Weird gag reflex in my throat often when I swallow, after meals, please help!?	I have been diagnosed with a MILD hiatal hernia and mild acid reflux, and I also had my gallbladder taken out about 2 months ago. After almost every meal, especially in the evening, I will feel way more full than I ought to feel, often accompanied by heartburn/nausea. But even when I don't feel anything bad in my stomach, I often feel a weird gag feeling when I swallow, almost like when you're about to throw up, just not near as severe. It just feels strange and uncomfortable, and sometimes scares me, especially since I'm afraid of throwing up. I feel it mainly on the right side, around where my right tonsil is. It kind of feels like something is in the way and just feels sort of like a gag feeling, however, I DON'T get this every single time I swallow. I don't think my tonsils are swollen.. Hyperthyroidism is prominent in my family but I thought that only makes it hard to swallow towards the bottom of your throat?      Also, I should add, if I am experiencing really bad heartburn, I get this feeling even worse than I'd normally get it.      Any thoughts on this? Any help would be helpful. I know it might be hard to understand since it's hard for me to explain what it feels like.      Could it be in my head? I doubt it though, because it seems so real. What could it be?      Thanks so much

20081015190137AA0wZKY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Stomach/digestion problems, PLEASE help! It's driving me insane?	I got my gallbladder removed in August, which the doctor expected would stop the severe, reoccurring heart burn I get. The heart burn is so bad that it makes me feel nauseous, and not until I start feeling better, I feel that it's actually heartburn. It's like acid, and a lot of air/pressure is stuck in the top of my stomach. I also am afraid to swallow sometimes, because sometimes when I swallow, I feel a slight gag reflex. I often feel really hungry once the heartburn starts to subside, which I find strange. I get this mainly in the evenings, after I eat dinner (even if it's a SMALL, early dinner), and I only remember one day in the past 2 months when I did NOT get it. I always avoid fatty & spicy foods and large meals.      I have been diagnosed with MILD acid reflux and a hiatal hernia. Should this cause me to feel this sick? It's driving me insane because it has been going on for 4 yrs. After the gallbladder surgery, my overall health became SLIGHTLY better but I still have this problem and it's causing me to even question going to college because I'm scared to feel sick every time I go to school.      I take tums, pepcid, and some even stronger medications when I feel sick and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.      Please, if you have any advice let me know. The doctor doesn't seem to know what it is. He has done so many tests on me including barium swallow, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and gallbladder ultrasound (like I said, my gallbladder is gone now).      Thank you. Any info/advice will be greatly appreciated.

I am still a virgin, my partner and I are getting close to having sex but I am a little worried that it will be too painful. It was hard for me to use tampons at first but after I used them about 3 times I was fine. Usually if I use my finger to feel if it will hurt I can only get one finger in and it is tight around my whole finger to where I have to go slow to make sure it does not hurt. Well the other day I tried 2 fingers to maybe stretch it a little so it will not hurt so bad the first time, that hurt but after that I tried 1 finger again and instead of it being really tight it was very easy to get in and was not tight around my finger at all. Makes since to me that it would be like this, like it did stretch but is that normal? Thanks.
20081022155410AA6zfrc	Health;Diet & Fitness	Not understanding this whole thing...?	Okay so my gym teacher says ( i'v heard other people say this too) that in order to loose weight you have to burn more calories than you eat. Well this doesnt seem possible to me... say you burn about 200 calories on a cardio machine at the gym and for the whole day you eat 1000 calories your eating alot more then you burn so how do you loose weight? I don't understand this whole thing.      Also I am eating about 1000 calories a day (all healthy food) and burning about 200 cals on cardio and doing a little bit of weights everyday. Do you think I will loose any weight? I have been doing this for about a week and a half and have lost nothing.       I know this is random but out of all the Shampoos and conditionars at salons what do you think is the best brand biologe, bed head ect... that makes your hair grow the fastest the least frizzy and keeps it very healthy.       Thanks!!!!!

But the only pregnancy symptom I've had was missing my menstrual cycle.   I've been feeling very sick and tired lately and my research shows that I may suffer from IBS.    I want to know if IBS is capable of stopping my period.      I've always suspected I've had a mild case of IBS in the past. But over the last 2 months it has gotten worse. I am very sure I have IBS.    I did some research and I suffer from all the listed symptoms.   --   Here's a list of some of the symptoms.      " * Anxiety or depression.       * Fatigue.       * Headache.       * Unpleasant taste in the mouth.       * Backache.       * Sleeping problems (insomnia) not caused by symptoms of IBS.       * Sexual problems, such as pain during sex or reduced sexual desire.       * Heart palpitations (feeling like the heart skips a beat or is fluttering).          Symptoms often occur after a meal, during stressful times, or during menstruation."   --   My stomach has grown almost an inch and has gotten firm and I always feel bloated.   I've also been a bit stressed and I've missed my period before (for 6 months, due to stress)   Has this happen to any other woman out there?   Have you thought you were pregnant but it was just IBS?   Is there anything I could do?   Going to the DR. isn't really an option because I have no insurance and no money. I'd love to see a DR, but it's out of the question at the moment.       serious answers only, please.    Thank you.    :)

It started with me having a migraine so I asked my mom if I could stay home and she said yes. The next day I said the same thing... And every other day since then I pretty much refused to go to school. I've always done this, refusing to go to school, I don't know why I do it but I hate myself for it. About 4 a days ago my mother thought I might be depressed.. I don't know if I am or not. (I'd like to add that my mother, father, sister and brother are medicated for depression.) For the past few days I've just felt sad. When I'm not at school for longer than two days I get really nervous and I stay home the next day because I'm nervous. I think I'm nervous because I'm staying home without a good reason. My highschool(I'm in the 9th grade) made me sign a contract saying a bunch of stuff about me missing school to much near the beginning of the year. When I'm at school I feel so much better but I just can't seem to get to school and my parents... Well they've given up on trying to get me to school. Just one last thing, when I stay home all I do is play video games while feeling nervous and depressed/sad... damnit... One last thing, my mom said she'd get me to the doctor on Wednesday.

20081007143523AAS9alg	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Removal of problematic dog warts?	My 8 year old cocker , "Max", has many benign sebacious tumors, - the so-called "warts".   Many of these are problematic as he licks and bites at the ones on his feet and fore legs. I have had several of these removed surgically in the past  but this is expensive especially as new warts just keep coming and coming.  Another method of removal is via CO2 laser but this overall procedure, while conceptually simple and direct, it is a "high end" treatment by high end vets who charge excessively.  These warts exude "stuff" and this tends to irritate the dog's skin (cockers are especially sensitive).  When this happens via a wart inside the ear, it can cause additional ear infections.        So, I am wondering if there is any experience out there with liquid nitrogen freezing on these types of dog warts.  This is what dermatologists use on human warts.     Does anyone have any thoughts or experience on this?        Thanks,  Bruce

20081103082226AA9YKxP	Health;Mental Health	My boyfriend is manic depressive & has a chronic acid reflux disease?	Doctors have said that it's one of the most serious cases of reflux that they've ever seen.  Apparently, he can't even stomach headache medicine, let alone meds for his mental issues.  Plus, he says that no antidepressants have been able to help.  He has VERY intrusive thoughts. I feel so helpless.  He is suffering inside- he cuts himself, wishes he weren't alive, feels like he doesn't belong. He says himself that he belongs somewhere for doctors to study him.  He often starts to give up on our relationship, fearing that he's only hurting me with all of it.  It IS very hard to deal with, but I love him and want him to have some relief.  He sees a therapist weekly. Apparently, he's supposed to be prescribed lithium, but can't afford it.  What medications have you found to be most effective in cases like these, and do you know how harsh they would be on the stomach? Thank you for any advise or tips on how to comfort a spouse with these symptoms.

20090131084712AAiAqlD	Health;Women's Health	What do you think about the woman who gave birth to octuplets. She already had six at home. ?	The woman who gave birth to octuplets this week conceived all 14 of her children through in vitro fertilization, is not married and has been obsessed with having children since she was a teenager, her mother said.      Angela Suleman told The Associated Press she was not supportive when her daughter, Nadya Suleman, decided to have more embryos implanted last year.      "It can't go on any longer," she said in a phone interview Friday. "She's got six children and no husband. I was brought up the traditional way. I firmly believe in marriage. But she didn't want to get married."      Nadya Suleman, 33, gave birth Monday in nearby Bellflower. She was expected to remain in the hospital for at least a few more days, and her newborns for at least a month.      A spokeswoman at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center said the babies were doing well and seven were breathing unassisted.      While her daughter recovers, Angela Suleman is taking care of the other six children, ages 2 through 7, at the family home in Whittier, about 15 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.      She said she warned her daughter that when she gets home from the hospital, "I'm going to be gone."      Angela Suleman said her daughter always had trouble conceiving and underwent in vitro fertilization treatments because her fallopian tubes are "plugged up."      There were frozen embryos left over after her previous pregnancies and her daughter didn't want them destroyed, so she decided to have more children.      Her mother and doctors have said the woman was told she had the option to abort some of the embryos and, later, the fetuses. She refused.      Her mother said she does not believe her daughter will have any more children.      "She doesn't have any more (frozen embryos), so it's over now," she said. "It has to be."      Nadya Suleman wanted to have children since she was a teenager, "but luckily she couldn't," her mother said.      "Instead of becoming a kindergarten teacher or something, she started having them, but not the normal way," he mother said.      Her daughter's obsession with children caused Angela Suleman considerable stress, so she sought help from a psychologist, who told her to order her daughter out of the house.      "Maybe she wouldn't have had so many kids then, but she is a grown woman," Angela Suleman said. "I feel responsible and I didn't want to throw her out."      Yolanda Garcia, 49, of Whittier, said she helped care for Nadya Suleman's autistic son three years ago.      "From what I could tell back then, she was pretty happy with herself, saying she liked having kids and she wanted 12 kids in all," Garcia told the Long Beach Press-Telegram.       "She told me that all of her kids were through in vitro, and I said 'Gosh, how can you afford that and go to school at the same time?"' she added. "And she said it's because she got paid for it."       Garcia said she did not ask for details.       Nadya Suleman holds a 2006 degree in child and adolescent development from California State University, Fullerton, and as late as last spring she was studying for a master's degree in counseling, college spokeswoman Paula Selleck told the Press-Telegram.       Her fertility doctor has not been identified. Her mother told the Los Angeles Times all the children came from the same sperm donor but she declined to identify him.       Birth certificates reviewed by The Associated Press identify a David Solomon as the father for the four oldest children. Certificates for the other children were not immediately available.       The news that the octuplets' mother already had six children sparked an ethical debate. Some medical experts were disturbed to hear that she was offered fertility treatment, and troubled by the possibility that she was implanted with so many embryos.       Others worried that she would be overwhelmed trying to raise so many children and would end up relying on public support.       The eight babies — six boys and two girls — were delivered by Cesarean section weighing between 1 pound, 8 ounces and 3 pounds, 4 ounces. Forty-six physicians and staff assisted in the deliveries

I have a 13 year old son, and he is in swimming lessons 3 days a week. After his hour lesson, we quickly run into the family changeroom he takes a quick shower and I make sure he gets a move on quickly because usually he will take WAY too long himself, (also pool policy to use family) and I've noticed that his skin is all wrinkled, not just on his hands but on his arms/legs/feet and stomache. It doesn't stay wrinkled for just a few minutes, it will stay like that for a couple hours, where it just feels all wrinkled.       What should I do to prevent this from happening? Even at home when he takes a shower or bath thats over 10 minutes, his skin gets all wrinkled for a very long time. I was even tempted to use a firming/toning lotion on him but I'm not sure if thats a good idea?       Any ideas?

I seem to be allergic to all shellfish and my reactions seem to be getting worse and worse, and every time I eat out I have an allergic reaction it seems like. I don't eat at seafood restaurants, but every where seems to be serving seafood now. Yesterday I ate somewhere I eat all the time (they serve shrimp with the same dish I had), and woke up this morning broken out in hives all over my neck and chest. They itch like crazy and burn, and haven't went away for over 12 hours. After eating breakfast, I felt kind of strange and dizzy, and then noticed my throat tightening up, took something for allergies, which helped, but continued to have an itchy throat and kind of soar and hard to swallow. I'm not sure really what I should do, as I have never had a reaction like this before. I could use someone who has had the same experience with this type of allergy. Kind of silly but I'm actually afraid to go to sleep.

I took a low dose birth control pill (Ortho Tricyclen Lo) during the month of December, then stopped taking it after I completed one entire packet of pills.  Up to that point, I had never taken ANY form of birth control pill in my entire life, and I have not taken any more pills since completing that packet.  Before taking the pill, I had a fairly normal menstrual cycle.      So my question is...  Is there anyone out there who also took a low-dose pill for only a month?  If so, then when did you have a regular period?  I've heard that it an take 1-3 months for normal menstruation to resume, but I assumed that that would be for women on the pill for a long time.  I've also heard that some women menstruate sooner than expected after stopping a low-dose pill.      So.... anyone else out there ever been in a similar situation?  If so, then how did it turn out for you?  Thanks in advance.

I don't drink anything besides fat free milk, lemon tea, green tea with lemon, and water.    Exercise:    6 days a week cardio: jog to the gym (takes about 10-12 min), 30-35 min on elyptical, treadmill, or stationary bike (different machine each day), walk back home (takes about 15-20 min)    3 of those days 30 min of toning right after the cardio.     What do you think? I started doing this two days ago and I feel like this is a plan I would keep up, but is this a plan that will work? Would I possibly lose 25lbs in 3 months?     Thanks!
