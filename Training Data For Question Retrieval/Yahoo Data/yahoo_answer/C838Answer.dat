XcNoptFbaa	We bought a George Forman G5 grill 2 monthes ago and we love it. The grill plates come out and you can either hand wash or put in the dishwasher. It has the regular grill for cooking steak and other meats, it has a waffle iron grates and a deep plate to cook eggs or whatever you want in there. The recipe book says you can make chocolate chip cookies in there, I haven't tried that yet. But I highly recomend it.

Early in the morning on Saturdays girls would walk down from the frat house back to their dorms or apartments with their clothes all askew, their hair a mess, makeup running down their face and a look of shame on their faces. They booze it up at the House all night and hope to get a girl to get too drunk to say no or pass out so she can be taken advantage of and leave her to the walk of shame the next day. A walk of shame party would be a party that was to promote this happening the next day.|`|1RjRDTw5aa	At a walk of shame party, girls usually dress up as they woudl look like the morning after. Sex, if you didnt get it. Their hair is all teased and messy, and blah blah blah. Same thing with guys, and usually that party is just an excuse to have sex and not really be a big deal thing .
lTkYWiy5aa	It just affects how strong the tea is. If I'm having a herbal tea, I will usually leave it in, but if I do it with Green or Black tea I find it makes the tea too bitter to drink, especially right at the end.|`|AA10625089	The longer you steep your tea the higher the caffeine content.    Caffeine content is also affected by the length of the infusion in water. Black tea infused for 5 minutes yields 40-100 milligrams, whereas a 3-minute infusion produces 20-40 milligrams, or half as much. Twenty cups of green tea yield 240 milligrams, or about 12 milligrams per cup.   Because tea bags contain broken leaves of smaller size, they produce an infusion with more caffeine than loose tea does. This is also true of very fine loose tea.     http://www.holymtn.com/tea/caffeine.htm|`|466d0df8a4110fb75f51028e25c34d52aa	i dont like paper in my mouth  and it gets too strong and makes it bitter  in my opinion  so i take it out|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	no its just a taste preference

They have more Caffeine in them than every other Energy Drink.    Also they are full of artificial flavorings and chemicals.     If you really need energy drink some of the 5 hour energy stuff.     My advice is stay away from energy drinks and just get some sleep.|`|KuVNm4R2aa	well it has all those energy zapper thingyss in itt. and funny you ask this question bcause at dancee today ((i dance from 10am to 5pm every saturday)) mee andd my DBC (dutchess ballet company) people ran to the gas station and we each got 5 :) and we were bouncing off the walls and we ran outside and were running and singing down the streets of beacon. it was so funny lmaooo|`|U7oJrc3faa	Monster is so gross, it's so syrupy....ew.

You probably can feel your heart trying to come out of your chest. I had a friend OD on energy drinks.

He had a fun little outing to ther ER.....|`|G8IRX295aa	Sugar|`|QADhk0nFaa	HEY! there not bad haha im a moster REP! man there good for you KEEP DRINKING HAHA!  why do you think there bad dude look at the ingredents but seriously KEEP DRINKING|`|if91nhuSaa	fgf|`|spAv5ZYCaa	they make you crash like crazy, DUH|`|hE9HDEJWaa	The main reason is because they contain high levels of High Fructose Corn Syrup, which has been proven in laboratories to induce sweet tooth. Try substituting fruits instead, or sparkling water with lemon. :)|`|x1yV4GAcaa	a whole lot of caffine plus its carbinated....|`|F64UACeRaa	I used to drink energy drinks for a while too, about 2 or more a week . My parents got mad and limited me on them. The reason they're so bad is the loads of caffeine and sugar. It definitely is unhealthy, but the taste is great. Also, the energy blend doesn't make them the healthiest thing to drink, either. Too much of anything is bad for you, but energy drinks can be very unhealthy.|`|zE6KabiWaa	has as much sugar as 20 chocolate sundaes, has as much caffine as 8 cups of coffee. good enough?|`|bnLYDUUTaa	they are bad for your heart and you can get heart disease and stuff|`|aBWT7SbMaa	caffine|`|WlRylbs4aa	they have a lot of caffeine and can get your heart beating really fast, which could be really bad.

Second, I heard they destroy brain cells.|`|54djQgFnaa	One is ok. Two is pushing it.  It's because of all the caffine and garauna that is in it. Garauna is similar to caffine, and causes very major energy crashes. The caffine can elevate your heart rate, and if it gets too high, you may go into cardiac arrest.|`|OIPZS74Xaa	I used to drink that stuff a lot... First of all, It doesn't really give you energy first at all. It blocks receptors in your brain that tell you that you are tired. It has tons of sugar, caffeine, guarine, and weird long named things in it. It basically makes your blood sticky, raising your blood pressure (a lot when you first drink it, and a little bit more over time even when you're not drinking it). It can cause heart problems (not very likely unless you drink a TON of it). But mainly it is just bad for you and it can give you a really, really bad crash.    Also, don't let these morons try to scare you into not drinking it. Like with anything, if you use moderation, you will be fine. My Advice: Don't drink it every day, and don't drink a lot at once. You said you drink it once a week. You don't have anything to worry about, enjoy it. One a week won't harm you.    EDIT: To the person who said I was lying: If you only have one you will have no problems. You clearly did not understand my answer. MODERATION is the key. Just like with anything. They are bad if you make a habit out of it, like drink 3 at a time, or drink one EVERY day.|`|IjwOIRcmaa	They have a high concentration of caffeine which is an addicting drug. Too much caffeine messes with your brain and energy levels. It can also damage your health.|`|aSkfrudKaa	It speeds up your heart way 2 fast. then it'll go slow.. you can have a heart attack or something worse. doesnt matter how old you are    too much cafeen!|`|jC87btvOaa	the load caffeine they put in it|`|BgVtUdMjaa	becuase its filled with chemicals and crap|`|nUmiUNklaa	one a week? are you ******* serious? oh yeah, that'll kill you in a second|`|jHN6B7FZaa	Guarana. Plus, some caffeine drinks dehydrate you.|`|AYDus3gTaa	One every week to every other week doesn't sound like you're addicted.  That is definitely not an excess in my opinion.  They do have loads of caffeine which isn't that good and probably lots of sugar so they aren't exactly good for you.|`|05acb0266567e942d6a9d77c99635642aa	Lots of sugar, caffeine and other nonsense that you really don't need to get energy.  They don't give you energy, they give you the jitters.  Get some exercise.  Try and get more sleep.  Eat healthy.  Get up and move around.  That is good energy.|`|jSH47SN7aa	there really isn't anything wrong with them but its the after affect that sucks the crash and the sugar in it|`|9iNd0Saxaa	caffine, and in a rumor i heard might make ur thingy smaller (just a rumor probably not true)if u know wat i mean

aVXsqdLpaa	I never saw a worm in a grape, but it won't hurt you.  (It's much harder on the worm!)     I'm happy if I find a worm in produce.  At least you know there's little or no pesticide in it.  That's good for your sister-in-law.|`|rS7Ggnslaa	the seeds inside the grape probably sprouted. it happens. not likely that it's a worm or maggot... gross|`|AA11303806	Sounds like a maggot maybe? Wouldn't be too worried, people hype how bad it is because its gross, small fruit worms and all that are mainly just protein. 1 maggot is ok to eat (as long as it isn't live, which may cause it to breed, although the stomach acids could probably kill it anyway) but I wouldn't start eating many of them, I wouldn't start worrying about going to that store again. Little or no pesticided food is healthier.    At least you know they are organic.
ox3fBjhlaa	I didnt have time to look it up but trust me you should go to allrecipes.com and look up best chewy chocolate chip cookie ever. I mean it is the best it is the only one I use. I hate the fluffy kind and dont like the crispy kind either. Use a little more really good vanilla unless you are using a double strenght kind. Let me know if you like it. It is the best.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Use bread flour.|`|AA10378447	Do not add more butter. Butter makes the cookies spread, which will produce a thin, crispier cookie.    Add a little more flour. Bake for a shorter time, at a higher temperature. The cookies need a higher moisture content in order to turn out chewy. These adjustments will allow for that.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Make the cookie dough into a ball when you place it on the sheet.Also  take away a little flour and add a little more butter.Hope this helps......
hKlsJgVSaa	Here are some thing to consider:    Was it frozen? That extends the life of food.    Does it smell sour, or rotton? Beef ages and has a lot better flavor if it sits in the fridge. A strong beefy type smell is okay, a rotton or sour smell is not. Also any kind of slickor slimy type feel is not good.    I know a lot of people will disagree with and will most likely give me a thumb down.

If you are cooking for people you don't usually cook for I wouldn't chance it... however if you are brave I would try cooking it. Remember that the internal temperature should be 165 degrees or above. It is especially necessary to fully cook hamburger, don't just go by the "if it is brown it is cooked" rule, since it is old, there is a good chance it is already partially brown.

L3gDCfCdaa	I think the idea of BBQ pizza is great! Just get some vegetarian/vegan shredded cheese and add whatever toppings.     I'd probably use it on tofu. Marinade it and bake it, or grill and coat it with the sauce when it's done.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Use it in baked beans (with out bacon of course)    In a sauce pan saute some chopped bell peppers, (turkey bacon if you like that or even tofu bacon) and onions. Add some canned pinto beans and then make a sauce using the b-b-q sauce and also ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar. Also season to taste with salt and pepper.    Or use it as a dip for fry's. Plain or mixed with ranch.    In a salad with black beans, corn, )chicken if you choose) tomatos, tortilla strips and b-b-q and ranch mixed together.    As a dressing for a wrap.    You could mix with sour cream and use as a dip for veggies or chips.    Use it with mayo or veganaisse, on a sandwich loaded with tons of veggies and a white cheese, or chedder.    Or use it in a vegetarian take on b-b-q beef sandiches. Cook up some lenyils and then add the b-b-q. Have it as a sandwich or even over rice or just in a big bowl.|`|vvoz2jeyaa	use it for pizza sauce it makes a great bbqed flavored pizza. you can also grill some firm tofu and ust the sauce on the tofu. use in a baked bean recipe or like catsup on french fries.|`|56XDflaGaa	make it into a salad dressing|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Make a batch of bbq baked beans.
AA11620976	Maybe on the mayo  Contrary to popular opinion mayo is actually very safe stuff .In almost all cases of food borne illness where  mayo is involved the real culprit turns out to be the high protein food that the mayo was used with i.e. egg , chicken  or tuna  salad  The reason for the"maybe " is b/c I don't know what kind of high  protein food  you have  mixed with your mayo.|`|AA10378447	It's not bad, but it will probably taste very nasty.

No ... sounds gross.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|9Ev7PdZGaa	yeah. its like mushyyy.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	it is not bad at all.  most casseroles and hotdishes are made with mayo.  they are reheated all the time.  dont worry about it.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Mayonnaise contains eggs. If the food was immediately placed in the refrigerator I might re-heat it one time. I would not re-heat anything containing mayonnaise that is over three days old, or has been left out of the refrigerator over a couple of hours. Many kinds of bacteria grow well at room temperature in egg based products.     Mustard has no egg products and is less prone to go bad.|`|XboNFF4maa	Since mayo is mostly oil the mayo will turn to just soupy and gross the mustard won't do anything but get hot maybe a little loose but it is fine.

zawmsUO1aa	Ah, don't get discouraged. Cooking is an art, but baking is a science - you gotta be careful with the measuring and the ingredients. Bread is one of the most infuriating things to bake.    The reason most yeast breads taste "yeasty" is because most recipes are for people in a hurry. Not many people have 4 or 5 hours to screw around with a loaf of bread, so recipes contain more yeast than ever before.     Doesn't matter if you're making it by hand or with a mixer & bread hook or with a bread machine, it's a lot easier than you think. I'm  not going to waste your time with another recipe if you're feeling discouraged.     Here's my favorite site for tips & tricks  http://www.baking911.com/bread/101_intro...    Shoot me an e-mail and I can help you troubleshoot any problems you may have - I baked 68 batches of bread in 2008. Honest.|`|PEvWgIkVaa	Maybe the oven isnt on High enough?  Maybe you didnt Add all the Ingredients?  Maybe you didnt add enough Eggs or milk???|`|BhJVJ3Vhaa	my mom makes really good bread!!!|`|1uyhFsFsaa	sounds like you are over prooving it, leaving it too long to rise. you can get packets of bread mix from the supermarket try with one of these first.     make sure the room you leave your dough in is nice and warm then cover with warm damp tea towel only leave for as long as it says on the packet then bake in a hot oven.    if you leave it to rise for too long the yeast ferments which is what gives it the strong flavour.    keep trying it took me ages to get it right but i did in the end    alternatively get a bread maker my friend has one and uses it all the time.|`|BD5WT4uZaa	EBAY BREAD MACHINES    http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll...          i'm amazed that you can even make pizza dough in a bread machine and not i haven't tried one yet, but in the future.|`|ShozrxbWaa	Some possibilities:  1.  Maybe you are dissolving the yeast in water that is too hot.  After dissoliving the yeast, if you can't smell it you have killed the yeast and it will not rise.    2.  Are you kneading the bread enough?    3.  Are you letting the dough rise twice?

YmRv7lJXaa	The semi-sweet baking squares wrapped in a paper look like 2 rectangles that are stuck together to make one square. That whole piece that is wrapped in the paper is the baking square. It is one ounce  and when a recipe calls for one baking square that is what they mean.|`|AA10378447	Just one.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	dont worry... lol i asked this same question to my mom when i made a batch of homemade cookies.

zuswGKZfaa	I don't think it should taste sour, although many of the flavors do have a lemon tang.  There should be a phone number on the bottle - if you call and give them the code, they can tell you the expiration date.  One other thing - I think it was made mandatory for all food items to have an expiration date - if yours doesn't it might mean it was made before that rule - and thus, rather old...good luck!|`|XboNFF4maa	Most likely it is bad that number is a batch number or a shipping number not a date, i would just toss it and buy more. Their tea does not taste sour to me.
yrhpnOUPaa	Maybe,  you probably should go to the doctor.|`|8SV7yGruaa	I would like to say just drink it man it will make things better even if u are upset man i can drink it like water.
AA12336927	I would say to use her 1234 cake recipe      *  1 cup (2 sticks) butter, at room temperature      * 2 cups sugar      * 4 eggs      * 3 cups sifted self-rising flour      * 1 cup milk      * 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract    Directions    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans. Using an electric mixer, cream butter until fluffy. Add sugar and continue to cream well for 6 to 8 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour and milk alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Add vanilla and continue to beat until just mixed. Divide batter equally among prepared pans. Level batter in each pan by holding pan 3 or 4 inches above counter, then dropping it flat onto counter. Do this several times to release air bubbles and assure you of a more level cake. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Cool in pans 5 to 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto cooling racks. Cool completely and spread cake layers with your favorite frosting to make a 3-layer cake.        or go here and ask. I always get an answer, so give it a shot  http://www.pauladeen.com/contact
TBKWMQCWaa	Drink about 32oz of water and eat about 4 slices of bread about an hour before you start. Then when you feel uneasy inside during, stop drinking, have some water and wait an hour more before you hit it again.|`|tireoWI0aa	don't drink too fast, be sure to eat and drink water throughout the night. take it slowly, be somewhere safe and make sure you really trust the friends your drinking with. do that and you'll be fine, it'll be fun. and no driving, obviously!|`|tvQFQDNbaa	LOL. in australia. everyone gets drunk at like.. 12.|`|3AxFYGgFaa	You will be drunk so fast you wont even know it but you should prob not drink very fast and allow the effects of each drink to settle in before you take another...and dont go home|`|PNkhcbMcaa	well let me tell you, if its your first time really drinking, dont just continue to drink constantly,, bc after a few drinks you might not feel much and be like, "oh i feel fine, i can handle more". but those drinks catch up with you so take it slow|`|o1vXdBIxaa	Mate I'm 12. Your gunna think aww look at this kid but don't. So I went to a after show cast party at this 17 yr old house. I got shitfaced after 4 beers. It's actually overated. Yhuu just feel half asleep and sum. I got shitfaced though|`|MpiTctvbaa	Eat before you start drinking, try to drink water throughout the night (if possible) pace yourself. Don't do too many shots, you may puke alot. There is such a thing as alcohol poisoning, so be careful, please don't drive!!!|`|26QSYQEbaa	Dude, you're 17! Your mom has good reason to keep a tight leash on you. Once a person is drunk there is no way to control his behaviors and even remember it the next day. Go study!|`|iFRBrCmvaa	Don't drink too much just to show off. Once you're feeling drunk, keep a drink with you to keep the buzz going but don't do anymore chugging or shots for a while. If you're feeling nauseous just sit down for a bit and drink less for a little while. Try not to mix too much beer and hard alcohol. Remember... Beer before liquor, never been sicker. Before bed drink a tall glass of cold water and take a couple tylenol. Keeps you from getting a hangover in the morning. Also, if you're drinking a bunch of sweet drinks you might get a really bad stomach ache. Stop drinking and sit down for a bit. It'll go away in about 15-20 minutes. Then you can go back to drinking. Have fun but be safe. As for doing stupid things while you're drunk, don't worry about it. Everyone will be doing stupid things. Most won't even remember and if they do, just tell them they're crazy and you don't remember doing it. HAHA|`|nzpmtGTRaa	yeah you got the same issue i had. 17 and weigh 135. you just need to know your limits. six beers gets me good, i have fun and remember the next day. your first time your gonna get shitfaced. you think you'll have self control but once you start felling good and someone offers you a shot your not going to deny it. get drunk, let your confidence rise, flirt with a chick you don't know (don't get with someone you do know unless shes as faded as you) and go out there and get some butt|`|hLohtlPEaa	When I was your age, I relied on my best girlfriends to keep an eye on me and I woul do the same for them.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	It depends.  Have you ever smoked weed before?  Could you control yourself the first time?  Well, ye the main question is do you know if you can control yourself?  If you know that you won't be able to, then it's best not to drink a lot.  If you're known for doing stupid things and such.|`|RTxFNURzaa	Hahaha getting wasted for the first time trust me your first time drinking your not going to get wasted|`|UKtZS3Wraa	1. dont do it  2. if youre going to do it, make sure youre in an enclosed place, and at least one of you is sober enough to look out after you guys, so you wont leave the house or do something youll regret|`|g8kIjpwSaa	stay away from shots until you've been drinking long enough to know your limits. Mix your own drinks because someone with a higher tolerance will have a different idea about how much booze should be in a drink. Since its your first time, try to stay away from the drinking games "**** the dealer" and "connections". Other than that, have fun and don't try to keep up the same drinking pace as your buddies. At least not for a while.|`|lHteMxSCaa	Scott is wrong.  Your body is not accustomed to alcohol.  You are gonna get wasted. Yer skinny too..That won't help.    Crap, I remember those days...sort of.      At first it will be really fun. You will be with your friends and laughing and joking and all, and you will feel really good.  This will lead you to drink more and more until you have had too much.  You have never experienced what is too much, so you will have no idea when that is.     So, it will be lots of fun up until the point your stomach starts to feel woozy and your eyesight gets all weird.  Try closing one eye to help keep your balance.  That will allow you to walk far enough away from  the crowd so that everyone doesn't see you puke all over your shoes.  Then, you should go HOME and wait for your friends to call you and tell you what a drunken *** you made of yourself. (of course, you won't remember any of that part)    Then, they next day, as you are cleaning your horrible stinking shoes, all hung over while trying not to puke again and swearing to yourself that you will never drink again, you get to enjoy that feeling of guilt.    Its just like a grey feeling of "did I say anything stupid?  did i do anything stupid? I don't remember"    The day after that, you will probably feel better, and by the weekend, your shoes wont stink anymore and you will want to do it again.        Its a terrible cycle..  But its the only way to learn your limits and become a socialable drinker.      I would however, wait untill I was older. You will be better able to handle it then.     That way you will save money on shoes.|`|tP2lPrH9aa	Dont get drunk|`|r8ST3cFIaa	I think that's a good age to start drinking  (i watch too much that 70's show)  just don't get too wasted and come home drunk to your rents'  have fun and don't drive  =)|`|eY49t8Swaa	im 18 and i weigh 130 and i got drink for the first time a few months ago    if i were you i wouldnt drank more than 3 since its your first time|`|NoGmacqNaa	If ur gettin wasted for the first time then it should only take u a few beers since ur body isnt used to drinking beer!! U will have a hangover the next day and The room will b like spinning for u hahhah it isnt really worth it hahah but ok good luck!!! hahha|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	If you approach it with the sole purpose of "getting waisted" you will end up puking your guts out and feeling like death all day tomorrow. That is if you are lucky, much worse can happen. Try to stay sober, odds are you won't but if you try you may at least be sober enough to see what asses your "cool" friends become.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	We all have drank underage. Just don't overdo it. Don't drink too much. Don't drive. Drink a lot of water. Make sure you know where you are sleeping. Be careful and good luck.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	well your first beer is going to taste awful you acquire a taste for beer but after your drunk you can't taste it anymore or it doesn't bother you or something idk and don't smoke because it will make you puke if you do smoke lets see if your shooting liquor make sure you have a chaser (a regular drink coke, sprite ect) to kill the taste in your mouth because it does not taste good um don't funnel liquor i found out thats a bad idea and when one of your sober friends say something is a bad idea but you don't agree its probably a bad idea and hold your nose when you throw up so you don't get punk all in your nose|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	Don't drink too much that you can't remember what you did.    Just get a nice buzzed feeling and don't over do it.    And DON'T drink and drive    If you over do it these things will occur    1) you puke your guts out for hours and swear you will never drink again.  2) someone calls you up 6 weeks later to tell you that you are going to be a daddy.  3) you end up in jail for underage drinking  4) you think you can drive and you kill yourself or someone else.    Just be careful and keep your pants on and don't get into a car with someone who has been drinking including yourself!|`|x0pqUrrgaa	**** your not get really **** up , you cant Harley walk and your gonna get a big *** headache and you don't recall anything|`|dXGvp5sVaa	17 and skinny? 6 beers will get you buzzed, any more will get you drunk if you drink them all within 1-2 hours. Don't take more than 8 shots if its your first time.

Also start with beer not liquor and make sure you eat a big meal before drinking so it absorbs some of the alc. Have a good time man|`|TyjaOszKaa	Um, from experience....try to drink everything chilled and sip.....never try to take to the head the first time and if you do and feel sick just bend down, touch your toes and throw up. Start off slow with wine coolers first....hope it goes well!!!|`|F61iTsooaa	well if i were you id drink something lighter. since its your first time dont have to much. let me say that agian  WHAT EVER YOU DO DONT HAVE TO MUCH. it'll save you from cleaning a mess up. ok a mickey of whiskey should be good and a 2L bottle o cola. or beer or maybe even coolers (dont let anyone talk you down about those they are stronger then beer) and when you get drunk dont drink more.|`|8ZoSSslFaa	Ok umm I am 14 and i weigh 103 so i know what you are going through with the weight and all. If you want to be able to drink more and not get all drunk then drink beer or something (hard liquor will get you drunk quicker especially with us that are not that heavy) Try to make sure that you are not in public (you don't want to get caught)If you feel like you are going to get sick take a cold shower (trust me it helps)....        Hope i helped Email me @ lehu349@hotmail.com if you have any more questions about it|`|AA11323749	You said that the obvious answer "don't do it' won't be considered, so here are my next best advice:    1.  DON'T DRIVE OR RIDE AS A PASSENGER WITH A DRIVER WHO HAS HAD ANY ALCOHOL.    2.  Don't lie about it later to parents or anyone.  If you are prepared to do it you should be prepared to be honest about it.    3.  I'm not sure where you are but I suspect your intention is against the law, don't break the law.  Becoming a criminal is stupid.    4.  During the entire event, avoid people that you ever want to respect you.    5.  DON'T GET NEAR A CAR WITH A CROWD OF DRUNK KIDS.  THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO DIE YOUNG.    6.  Always drink less than everybody else.    7.  Don't mix alcohol with any other kind of drug.

Candy in general will put you at risk for diabetes, and it does cavity damage to your teeth. You can eat them, but do not make a habit of it.
cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and worked in Asia, and there are few who have mentioned the process, some will use a tenderizer or tenderizing method to soften a lesser cut of beef, then roll it in cornstarch and oil blanch it before stir frying, this is in restaurants at home it is not as common, and as for the rumours of cats being used, I never saw them in the markets when I worked in Singapore or Japan, and I did side trips to Thailand, Hong Kong and Vietnam.    And in North America, they would have to go out and troll for strays, as the SPCA does not sell them by the dozen. So resist the urge to think this, your a reasonable person and have a functioning brain, so be realistic.|`|8lYZROjuaa	I  don't know what they use, but I rarely eat CERTAIN Chinese foods due to the consistency of the meat texture.  Don't get me wrong, I love Asian cooking, it's just that some restaurants do not have the same standards as others.  It very well may have been beef, but a much cheaper cut than one you or I may have chosen to utilize.    Buffets are normally kind of 'iffy.'|`|AA11521202	The thing about Chinese food is that they put so much Asian seasoning in it, you can't really taste the beef anymore. And, according to my mom, we don't eat cat, nor does any other Chinese!|`|eUpAGLOiaa	if it's not poisonous and doesn't contain pathogens don't sweat it.  I felt a little creepy after eating whale once, but aside from hearing that is was whale flesh everything was cool.|`|hkw4LbARaa	Chinese recipes often use cornstarch on meat to "silken" a tough cut of beef, it also changes the texture of the meat.|`|TBf8WFfeaa	it wasn't likely to be cat (which is lighter gray more like pork) what you had would have been dog.you have to remember that some cultures don't see that as any different than us slaughtering a pig or cow or a goat. always check the dumpsters behind the place before eating there. one place did have a dumpster of cat carcasses.|`|93fXLKkCaa	lots of people tell you the wrong food for example:  i was at my friends house and they served me what they call  "steak" but when i was done eating they said"is it good" i said"ya"   then they said"you ate antalope" i was mad|`|mlmSRkhGaa	dude, its better you dont know.|`|f5e243b3090fd85449d1a91b415bf5d8aa	I seriously doubt it. You can do a tremendous amount to change the look and flavor of any food by changing the way it's prepared. And all restaurants are subject to health department inspections.|`|AA10753168	You misunderstood.  You were served a plate of Biff, a former employee.  This is common in other cultures, as well; ever heard of Biff Wellington? :)|`|9HRkwzruaa	I doubt you had cat; unless you were at a street market in Thailand (where you might just get served dog), restaurants wouldn't risk the health department and Animal Welfare coming down on them.    Asian cooking methods are different from American; as another poster indicated, many times the meat is coated with cornstarch, which does change the taste and texture.  It's meant to thicken the glaze, but it does taste different.    If nothing else, it may have been pork and they misunderstood.  But no, I highly doubt you just ate Fluffy.

KHlCYna1aa	A large amount of food from Lebanon is not actually specific to Lebanon and can be found in neighbouring countries including Syria and Israel which leads to argument over who actually introduced their food first however when Lebanese people came to Australia they brought many kinds of food and ingredients including:    Tabbouleh  Fattoush  Hommos  Vine Leaves (where available but not used in cooking until the arrival of migrants)  Many new kinds of yoghurt and ways of cooking with yoghurt  Ajeen  Toum  Taratour    Due to global trade very few new ingredients came with any migrants as even when Australia was first founded the British had already explored most of the world and its ingredients.
wX1xcnZOaa	I think it's the word 'vegan'. As soon as people hear it they immediately think 'extremist' even if you aren't.    Maybe try telling people "I don't eat meat or dairy" instead of saying vegan, they might take it a bit better.|`|iXx9SWceaa	I personally admire vegans. I'm a vegetarian, and I want desperately to be a vegan.... But I'm fourteen, and I'm kind of pushing it with my parents already with just being a simple lacto-ovo-vegetarian. It sucks. As soon as I move out, I'm becoming a full vegan, I made up my mind a while ago about that.    Anyway.... people are very accustomed to being omnivores. And they love  eating the corpses of innocent tortured animals. It's just become natural for them to disobey nature and eat meat. They may feel intimidated by our efforts to better ourselves and therefore feel the need to justify their actions. Humans have adapted to meat eating over the years, but we were actually created herbivores. I'm an Atheist, but if I may say something religious without being bashed.... Since the majority of society is Christian, I'd like to say, that their "god" intended for them to be herbivores, and they became omnivores by SIN.     Vegetarians and vegans can get everything they need in a diet without  meat. Plants can give you everything you need, and yes, that includes protein. And iron, D and B vitamins, calcium, and zinc. Meat contains saturated fat and cholesterol. It also contains, all of the antibiotics, pesticides, and hormones the animal that died for you to eat was treated with. Many studies have shown that all kinds of vegetarians have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attacks), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer. Vegetarianism and veganism are both perfectly healthy.|`|6t76bgS3aa	i don't care what you eat as long as you don't think i'm a murderer for fishing and hunting|`|PYIHDmAiaa	well people shouldnt be steriotipical. like its not weird, some people just dont no what they would do with out meat|`|9TE9lOKBaa	i'm the exact same way. i'm vegan, and people should eat whatever they want.   there's just a lot of narrow-minded people.|`|drI1vsJdaa	I'm the same, and people are like "Well, I'm a meatatarian" I get mad when people diss me, but if they eat meat or whatever and don't shove it in my face, I'm fine.|`|5VHEcfp2aa	Personally I dont care...but i guess people are just trying to conform to what society wants them to be|`|KcAehrrKaa	That's cool, I respect that.|`|N5t4wZyTaa	Your a vegan?

Thanks for not hating me for being a meat eater.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	It's because the human race is designed to be omnivorous.    Not eating meat is not the way that things are supposed to be for humans.  It literally goes against nature to make that choice.  I am not saying that it is wrong, I'm just saying that because you choose to be different, people think you are odd.|`|OYgtlTEfaa	Please don't be offended by my answer. Since I don't know you, please don't take this personally.    Every vegan I ever met was not just an average, everyday person, who just happened not to eat meat.

I'm sure I'm not the only meat eater out there that has noticed this.|`|6Apou72oaa	I don't thing being vegan is weird, I just don't think it's very healthy.  You are missing out on important vitamins (B Complex).  It's amazing what deficiencies in the B vitamins can cause.  I realize that most animals are raised in deplorable conditions and are pumped full of chemicals, but it is possible to get meat that is from animals raised in more natural environments without the chemicals.  You have to really look around though.  And if you don't want to eat meat, at least eat some eggs.  It is possible to find eggs from free range, organic, grain-fed chickens, and they taste so much better than other eggs too.|`|K3RzcMRTaa	i dont care.|`|tjBRtIQEaa	Why do Vegans think people are so weird?|`|Ebfkg4kJaa	yah i dunno why ppl freak out when i tell them that im a vegetarian. maybe because going without meat seems so extreme to them?|`|PNkhcbMcaa	because 98% of americans love them some fried chicken|`|SQtlo5xHaa	its a NEW thing and people act all dumb and like itiots when new stuff happens that they don't want to do themselves|`|W9mGt5NMaa	because its not natural to be vegan    EDIT: i have nothing against veganism. i myself am vegetarian. you could also say being vegetarian is unnatural. im just saying thats why people have a tendency to think its wierd. think about it. humans are made to eat meat, and to use animal products to their benefit.|`|IFQLXG2Saa	Well, most people aren't vegan, and a lot of them haven't seen many vegans. They might have imagined what it would be like if they didn't eat any animal products, and thought it's crazy.

I dont eat any land animals, just fish and i dont eat dairy either. but alot of ppl think its strange not to eat meat because they cant do it, i think it might also be jealousy, because a diet without red meat is a healthier diet and many ppl dont have the discipline to follow a healthy diet so they are envious that u have more self control than they do because they cant say no to that cheeseburger.   im not saying ALL ppl who eat meat think this way, just some ppl might, its human nature.   i have eaten meat only on special occasions with my family, like on holidays but NEVER pork (for religious reasons, its in the bible).  and when i went to my bf's house and met his parents his mother asked what religion i was because i said i didnt eat pork (and that was the dinner), and i am catholic just like them. but since they eat alot of pork they thought it was strange that i NEVER eat it.  and also some ppl get offended that u wont eat their food but at least they respected that i dont eat pork but i still dont like that everything is fried (even the fish and vegetables) since i eat my food raw or grill it. never fry. and they eat alot of other meat too.     and my friends get upset because they love to go out to eat but i like to make my own food but they get upset when i eat salads.   but like i said, some ppl are envious. they see that you are eating healthy and taking better care of yourself and they want you to be on their level eating the same bad stuff they are eating. like i said, its human nature    anyways i am not saying that meat eaters are this or that, just that some ppl may be envious because it is human nature and i understand meat have protein but red meat is very cancerious.  when you eat red meat your liver produces bile to help digest the meat and when you eat meat alot of bile builds up and you colon and when you have too much bile it can be cancerous and you can develop colon cancer. and my grandmother had it so you can also see that i am trying to prevent it by barely eating red meat.     so keep doing what u are doing but eat stuff like soy and nuts to get protein and get enough vitamin b.    dont worry what ppl what ppl think, its your life and you should be allowed to eat however u want.|`|3088210edce2911ef9c82a673f040f04aa	I think it is because most people are ignorant, stubborn or just don't care. My family is are full on meat eaters!!  Bad Cholesterol and all. When I grew up I was raised around it and didn't think twice about. I was basically blinded by the propaganda of fast-food places like  McDonald's and Burger King. Until I saw a clip on a site about how animals are tortured. It's inhumane and unnecessary, I'm a full on animal lover and I felt like a hypocrite saying I love all animals while I am shoving down a Big-Mac. People think I'm insane also, so your not alone. I don't pester people either (may wear a anti-meat shirt here and there) but other than that I let my friends keep on shoving their faces with decaying animals =] I'll slip some knowledge by them some times.

Add the remaining yogurt, hot sauce, cumin, garlic and salt.    Cut each chicken breast half into 6 to 8 equal pieces.    Add to the yogurt mixture and stir until well combined. Thread the chicken onto eight skewers. Place in a doubled gallon-size ziptop bag (to guard against leaks). Chill for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Pack in a cooler to bring to the park.    At the park, prepare the coals for grilling. Grill the kebobs over medium heat, rotating sides every few minutes, until cooked through, about 10 to 14 minutes total.    Serve with extra hot sauce and lemon wedges. Serves 6 to 8.    COOKING TIP:  While you have the grill going, cook up some veggie kebobs to serve alongside the chicken. Simply thread cherry tomatoes, zucchini, onion and other vegetables on skewers, brush with olive oil, and cook until slightly tender.    or this one    http://searcha.familyfun.go.com/?q=shrim...|`|nJGoj9Nyaa	Shrimp soaks up marinade.

That's no different to any other diet in that respect. If you ate nothing but corn chips, fries and Coke for example, it's pretty obvious that weight gain would follow pretty quick.    Weight being more stable on a plant based diet is usually due to the intake of more whole foods - i.e. foods which have not been processed for high fat and sugar content. Vegans tend to eat more of these. That's not to say that all vegans have no problems with weight, but generally it's the case that vegans can manage their weight easier.|`|wX1xcnZOaa	It is possible, but if you eat a varied vegan diet with the right amount of grains, nut and vegetables it's pretty unlikely.|`|muFRe9JIaa	Yes, there are a number of fatty foods as well.  I am from Hong Kong and although some Buddhist temples serve vegan food for visitors, some of the plates aren't as healthy as they sound.  For example, deep-fried Tofu, which uses and absorbs a lot of vegetable oil - fat. Nuts are also rather fatty foods too.    It may be less likely to become overweight on a vegan diet, but I stress that it is less likely, not impossible.  Lack of exercise will contribute greatly to becoming overweight too.  So don't go thinking that being a vegan will let you get away from exercise!|`|UyhmdJKUaa	Yes, I meet a vegan with a obesity a while back.

US,UK,Canada all eat way too much cooked & overly refined foods.  I see many fat Veggies & Vegans. When their diets are examined they are not eating enough fresh, raw, natural foods. They do too many of the packaged V&V food. Those are very high in FATS.    1st step eat a huge fresh Salad lunch & dinner as 1st course(with a modest amount of quality dressing), then a low-fat veggie dish, whole grain rice or potato.

Going vegan implies long-term, permanent changes to your eating (and other) habits.    As with any 'diet', there can be too much of a good thing. I know overweight/obese vegans but that's because they eat too many/too large portions. Moderation and regular exercise are key to maintaining a good body weight.    For more information for eating vegan and being overweight, please see this chapter from Davis and Melina's book 'Becoming Vegan'.    http://www.scribd.com/doc/2674603/Becomi...|`|AA12016863	Your choice of which food to eat is quite irrelevant regarding whether or not your waistline increases or decreases. The ONLY thing that matters when watching your weight is:  Calories in vs calories out.  a normal portion is Texas, USA is different from a normal portion in central Honduras or northern Russia. Everyone on Earth has some kind of genetic disorder, because we have yet to perfect the manipulation of human DNA in attempts in human cloning programs (the ones no ones supposed to know about).  I've been vegan for over 8 years. I started overweight (although not obese), and am still overweight today. In that time, some years I dropped 20 Kg, putting me in the healthy range, other years I put on more, putting me just slightly over the imaginary line into obese. Truth is, people find a comfort zone, and regardless of what they do in their life, 9 times out of 10 they will remain in the weight range they were when they entered adulthood. A few have the inner strength and will power to change their habits, and a few will find their will power deteriorate, their waistline increase gradually and steadily, and one day find themself on telethon.  Being on a vegan diet invariably improves your health and well being, by making your organs function more effectively, making your skin smoother, cleaner, stronger, and clearer, making your senses more refined, better eyesight, better hearing, better sense of smell, and more sensitive sense of touch. You feel like you have more energy and vitality, and most importantly you feel happier and peaceful. It generally does all these things to people who get on it and stay on it, but does not always affect those people's waistlines.  Calories in vs calories out.

It's not really diet-related at all.

Well, in that case 1 oz is about 28.4 mL.  This is slightly higher than the US ounce.    So, a pint is 20oz, which would be 568.2mL, which is much more than a US pint (we used 16oz = 1 pint, with a slightly bigger ounce).      Then you clearly see that 1 pint = 0.5682 L, so if we divide both sides by 0.5682 we will get    1.76 pints = 1 L    (You can also look at a bottle or can and see if it lists both ounces and mL on it.  In the US, we usually see 12 fl. oz (355mL) on everything.  Even better is when we see 16.9 fl oz (500mL).  In that case, 1 L = 33.8 fl oz = 2.113 pints, since we have a 16oz pint).|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	one litre = 2.11337642 US pints|`|q8N1KZgoaa	use the Google calc.|`|AA11966816	UK pints :-   1 litre is 1.76 pints so approximately 1 3/4|`|f5wTQblsaa	Little rhyme to help jog your memory:- A litre of water is a pint and three quarter|`|e8f092bbd197b0b3bdad36d4e1287a01aa	Gooogle|`|W06VTCDjaa	almost 2.2|`|98lD3z68aa	2.1.

Royal icing recipe:    Ingredients        * 3 ounces pasteurized(for safety purposes) egg whites      * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract      * 4 cups confectioners' sugar    Directions    In a stand mixer combine the egg whites and vanilla and beat until a stable foam has been established (but don't mix for too long). Add confectioners' sugar gradually and mix on low speed until sugar is incorporated and mixture is shiny. Turn speed up to high and beat until mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks. This should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Add food coloring, if desired. For immediate use, transfer icing to pastry bag or heavy duty storage bag and pipe if desired or just directly frost it on to the cake. If using storage bag, clip corner.

We are going to try Ranchero Sauce next time just to see if that works.       Feel free to use this info to try and match it. Please post any results here so the rest of us can benefit. Thanks!!
iqHrzhYuaa	Most of the "brick-and-mortar" shops either have really ugly stuff, or high-class expensive stuff. There are mostly good shops online.|`|llkSmgLJaa	I don't know of any store that doesn't have vegan clothing. Just read the labels, you can't have: wool, silk, leather, or fur.

iXx9SWceaa	Don't listen to the people trying to tell you vegetarianism is unhealthy. Many studies have shown that all kinds of vegetarians have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attacks), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer.    Try getting some mock meats. I like Morning Star and Boca. But trust me on this one, Full Circle is nasty!    Anyway.... DIET TIPS TIME!    -PROTEIN  Plant proteins should provide for you enough, as long as you make sure your calorie intake is high enough for your energy needs.  -MORE AMINO ACIDS  If plant proteins simply aren't enough, try eating whole grains, nuts or seeds.  -IRON  If you're not totally vegan, egg yolk provides iron well. However, dried beans, dried fruits, and spinach are good sources as well.  -VITAMIN B 12  This only comes naturally from animals. It can be found in some fortified (not enriched) breakfast cereals such as Total and some brands of nutritional brewer's yeast, or in supplements.  -VITAMIN D  You will need a reliable vitamin D source. If you don't get a lot of sunlight, you'll probably need a supplement.  -CALCIUM  Studies have shown that vegetarians absorb and retain more calcium than meat eaters. Cool, huh? Calcium can be found in greens such as spinach, kale and broccoli, and some legumes and soybean products.  -ZINC  Grains, nuts and legumes are good sources. If you chose to take a supplement, be sure to pick supplements containing no more than 15-18 mg zinc. Supplements containing 50 mg or more may lower HDL ("good") cholesterol in some people.    --And some more tips--  Keep your intake of sweets and fatty foods to a minimum. These foods are low in nutrients and high in calories.  Choose whole or unrefined grain products when possible, or use fortified or enriched cereal products.  Use a variety of fruits and vegetables, including foods that are good sources of vitamins A and C.  If you use milk or dairy products, choose fat-free/nonfat and low-fat varieties.  Eggs are high in cholesterol (213 mg per yolk), so monitor your use of them. Limit your cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg per day.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	get mock meat, it tastes very similar to meat, especially if you spice it up like meat like using barbacue sauce, etc.  and the first answerer was right, an omnivore diet can be just as healthy as a vegetarian diet.|`|g6OlCaOlaa	yves meatless ground can be very helpful for a quick and easy substitute for meat.  i make it all the time for my family who is not vegetarian and they like it and so do I.|`|JPssvCAvaa	Cut your meat intake in half and eat extra green vegetables.

Don't forget to do your research! Make sure you know exactly what you're getting into.     Do it in steps going cold turkey only works for some people. Slowly decrease the amount you eat until you're down to none, then when ever a craving hits you can substitute meat with one of the many awesome meat replacements out there. Or instead of using the fake meats substitute your meat with some tofu or seitan or a big fat mushroom.  This is coming from a girl who was a heavy meat eater now vegan. This may not be true for everyone but- it's easier than you think once you get started.  Another way to ween yourself off of meat is to just be proud of yourself! Think of the times you're turning away from eating an animal product- it feels good! You were strong enough to let it go!|`|x33XAGUhaa	watch a video of an animal being killed and then try to eat that same type of meat... you will never want to look at it again.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	If your main goal is to be healthy, then you have been misinformed.

AA12336927	My favorite food is chicken fried steak. I swear I could eat it at least 3 times a week and not get tired of it. This is my favorite recipe  Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak with Cream Gravy  It is hard to get much more Texan than Chicken Fried Steak. Quality of the beef really counts in this dish. This recipe calls for cube steaks, but good round steak that you have asked the butcher to run through the tenderizer or that you have tenderized yourself with a mallet (no big deal and can be a real stress reliever) can be even better.        * 4 tenderized beef cutlets (known in supermarkets as "cube steak") OR 1 round steak, with fat removed, that you've tenderized yourself (see above)      * 1 egg      * 1/4 cup milk      * all-purpose flour      * cooking oil or melted Crisco?      * 1/2 teaspoon salt      * 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper      * 1/4 teaspoon paprika      * 1/4 teaspoon white pepper    Beat together the egg and milk and set aside. Mix together the salt, black pepper, paprika and white pepper and sprinkle on both sides of beef cutlets.    Dredge the cutlets in the flour, shaking off the excess. Then dip each cutlet in the egg/milk mixture, then back in the flour. (You're going to get your hands messy here, so take your rings off.) Set cutlets aside on a piece of waxed paper.    Heat the cooking oil in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Oil should be about a half-inch deep in the pan. Check the temperature with a drop of water; if it pops and spits back at you, it's ready.    With a long-handled fork, carefully place each cutlet into the hot oil. Protect yourself (and your kitchen) from the popping grease that results. Fry cutlets on both sides, turning once, until golden brown. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook 4 or 5 minutes until cutlets are done through. Drain cutlets on paper towels.    Cream Gravy  After the cutlets are removed from the pan, pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of oil, keeping as many as possible of the browned bits in the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat until hot.    Sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour (use the left-over flour from the chicken fried steak recipe) in the hot oil. Stir with a wooden spoon, quickly, to brown the flour.    Gradually stir in 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water, mixed together, stirring constantly with the wooden spoon and mashing out any lumps. Lower heat, and gravy will begin to thicken. Continue cooking and stirring a few minutes until gravy reaches desired thickness. Check seasonings and add more salt and pepper according to your taste.    Note to Cream Gravy novices: Gravy-making is an inexact science. Cream gravy is supposed to be thick, but if you think it's too thick, add more liquid until you're satisfied with it.|`|XcNoptFbaa	Baked Ziti    1 pound dry ziti pasta   1 onion, chopped   1 pound lean ground beef   2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce   6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced   1 1/2 cups sour cream   6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded   2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese     Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

The following is basic. easy to make one pot.    Piece of stewing meat a tough shoulder piece with good marbling in it, if it has bone better still. Cut into about 2" cubes.  Coarsley chop a medium onion, celery one to two sticks.    Also have the following prepared, three carrots peeled and coarlsey chopped, parsnip peeled and chopped. Peel three potatoes, on the shredding part of your grater shred 1 medium potatoe, quater the rest, for your family you may have to peel a couple of extra potatoes if your big eaters.     Glass of red wine if you have, and vegetable stock.    Method: add oil to your pot, and heat, brown your meat well all over, but don't crowd the pot, you may have to do it in two parts. Once browned, remove all put aside. Don't forget if there was any bone add those also.    Add your celery and onion and saute, as you see the onion soften, return the meat to the pot stir and add your glass of wine, using the wine to scape all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the pot we call deglazing.     All those vegetables you peeled and chopped add those now, and cover with the stock, bring to a boil, allow to boil for a few minutes reduce heat to medium add your shredded potatoe, this is your thickener. cook at medium for an hour, and occasionally stir, and check liquid, I have found I have had to add more stock due to the thickness of the forming gravy. Reduce to a simmer, and let it do it's thing when the meat is good and tender your ready to dive in and have a feast.    Serve with warm crusty bread and dunk the bread in the gravy to your hearts delight. One thing to remember, before your ready to serve, check on seasoning, you may need to add salt you will definately will need to add pepper.    Enjoy need more let me know.

hKlsJgVSaa	I love shirley temples and roy rodgers. Shirley temples are 7-up and grenadine with a merischino cherry, and roy rodgers are the same but with coke.    But after doing sme googling I found out that Arnold Palmers are considered a mocktail. Some people call them 50/50's. Just lemonade and iced tea.    Pour the lemonade down in the glass first then carefully add the ice tea. You could do a different kind of tea. Like a raspberry with regular lemonade etc...Garnish with a lemon wedge.    This one also sounded kind of good. On the sweet side but not so fruity.    http://cocktails.about.com/od/mocktailmo...    There was also a lime juice and cola. Or "lime and cola". I drink Lime juice with 7-up when I go out and don;t want to drink. I keep the lime in the glass so everyone thinks I am drinking but I don;t have to worry about drinking to much.    Add a bit of chili powder or hot sauce to this one to make it more "manly"  http://cocktails.about.com/od/cocktailre...    This one would be okay. Still a bit fruity but not as much...  http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/beverag...    When I look I can see your dilema, most mocktails are fruity and kind of girly.     My sister in law does all kind of mixers with 7-up. But try some with cola and see if it tastes god or not.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	first off amaretto is a liquer and has an alcohol content (albeit small) so it is not a "mocktail", further, most cocktails involving cola or usually just cola a liquor. rum and coke, vodka and sprite, etc.  so really it would be just coke.  no you can do a shirley temple with cherry juice (instead of the alcoholic version which includes grenadine), or no-tequila sunrises with oj and cherry juice (again in place of grenadine).|`|Bge5zjJYaa	amoretta and dr pepper is really good
ytLUphDgaa	It is different for everyone. Even someone with the same weight and age as you could get drunk quicker or could take longer. Females generally get drunk quicker (this is a fact not me being sexist). Tolerance is another ,even if you've never drank before you can have  biological tolerance that will affect how much you can drink.  I really can't say though. I know people that drink 5 beers and are drunk and people that can take 10 shots and be fine. if you want to get drunk then try it some time.|`|kXIRz2jwaa	You would be fubar on 3 mixed drinks or 3 beer, or 3 glasses of wine or 3 shooters, so be careful. Go slow and have a full stomach when you drink, don't worry you will get a buzz. A bottle of beer, a mixed drink, a glass of wine, and a shooter, all have the same amount of kick regardless of the size of the drink. Don't mix your category's of drinks. Stay with beer or a mixed drink or a particular wine. Don't even mingle your mixed drinks.   Don't go out alone or with anyone you don't know or trust. Lay off the shooters. Remember that.|`|5VHEcfp2aa	This should solve your problem...it has a chart which measures BAC to body weight so whatever amount is past 0.08 for your weight and gender is the number drinks it takes for you to get drunk    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcoh...|`|k3EObSxwaa	Be smart and don't try it. I never got drunk but I did get sick to my stomach and passed out. That was the ending of my drinking, there is more to my story but to long to explain here but I could have been robbed or worse. There is nothing to be proud of about getting drunk. From the looks of your picture you could end up "wirh child"

ciHjZsnLaa	About your dream. Apart from the explanation I tried to give. The drinking process always leads to very, very bad experience. Not only it deprive your conscious mind of the right way to think, but it also occult your inner subconscious process.For a body it's like entering to MUDDY WATER, as gin may be interpretation by your subconscious that is trying to warn you!

FxWppY7Baa	Peta sponsored food eh Mikey? I am an organic grower and I dislike PETA along with thousands of us who raise livestock (and PETA doesn't like us either)    okay on the the question. i see organic as a growing sector. As we run out of cheap oil the conventional, petroleum dependent conventional agriculture is going to become increasingly more expensive to do and seeing as how most conventional farmers are barely making ends meet and something like 85% must work off the farm full time to pay for their farming habit an increase in inputs will put more and more of them out of business.     Why? Because conventional farming is not sustainable in any way shape of form. Conventionally managed farms are not economically sustainable, they are not environmentally sustainable so in a matter of 10 to 20 year these farms will not be able to go on without larger subsidies (which they already get over $10 billion from the USDA)    Organic farms on the other hand tend to be both economically and environmentally sustainable if well managed. organic farms are beginning to outproduce their conventional counter parts and a growing body of peer reviewed science is telling us that across the board organic foods are more nutritious.    The downfall of organic farming is it is more dependent on labor and far less dependent on chemicals so we will have to start training millions of people to farm because we will need far more than the 1% of the population currently farming to manage and won the organic farms.     But overall I see this form of farm management continuing to grow world wide. i also predict we will see less starvation world wide as communities are allowed to grow local foods for the local people organically instead of the growing food for export they are not doing (and this is destroying the social structures of those areas and forcing people off the land)|`|TsnAZy9Aaa	Organic food is a gimmick is there was so many bad things in normal food the government would step in. Its big money trying to make a buck in this economy invest your not throw it a way on PETA sponsored food

If you were to open them and want to re-use them then yes you would need to put them in the fridge. However I usually use them up.    Keep in mind that they are okay to be kept at room temp. Not in a hot room or area. And no to Will Not expand when put in the fridge. Heat causes expansion, and cold causes things to shrink. (Having a brain fart and can't think of the "scientific" name for shrink.)|`|AA10625089	No, it's not necessary.

Om9CFRpsaa	You should try the NY Times cookie Recipe. It's fantastic. Crunchy and soft. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/dining...    NY Times - Quest for the Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe    Chocolate Chip Cookies    Published: July 9, 2008    Adapted from Jacques Torres    Perfection? Hint: Its Warm and Has a Secret (July 9, 2008)    Time: 45 minutes (for 1 6-cookie batch), plus at least 24 hours chilling    2 cups minus 2 tablespoons    (8 1/2 ounces) cake flour    1 2/3 cups (8 1/2 ounces) bread flour    1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda    1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder    1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt    2 1/2 sticks (1 1/4 cups) unsalted butter    1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) light brown sugar    1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 ounces) granulated sugar    2 large eggs    2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract    1 1/4 pounds bittersweet chocolate disks or fves, at least 60 percent cacao content (see note)    Sea salt.    1. Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside.    2. Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.    3. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside.    4. Scoop 6 3 1/2-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. Eat warm, with a big napkin.    Yield: 1 1/2 dozen 5-inch cookies.    Note: Disks are sold at Jacques Torres Chocolate; Valrhona fves, oval-shaped chocolate pieces, are at Whole Foods.|`|ae750802f24b9b0df78aaf2e9eb54dcbaa	The best cookies come from Amish recipes.

She then dipped the chicken strips into beaten egg, then into seasoned flour (salt and pepper mixed with flour), and then finally into seasoned breadcrumbs which she said you could buy in a can from the store.  However it looked like breadcrumbs with salt, pepper and some dried herbs in it.  She mixed freshly grated parmesan into the breadcrumbs before using it to cover the chicken.  She then shallow fried them in a frying pan.  She said you could keep these warm in the oven after cooking for around 20 mins.  They looked really, really good (and I'm vegetarian lol).

8Wqbz6FMaa	Chinese celery is closely related to the regular celery we buy from the grocery store.  Chinese celery is smaller and has much thinner stems, which does not matter because only the leaves of this celery  is used. The stems of the Chinese celery are bitter and fibrous.  On the other hand, Chinese parsley is what we call cilantro or coriander plant and widely used as ingredient in Mexican salsa and dips, and Asian fresh spring rolls.  Although you can interchange them as toppings in salads, you are better off using what the recipe calls for because they will change the flavor/taste of your dish.  When you look for them in the store and to make sure that you are getting the right one (they do look alike at first glance because they belong in the same family) pinch a leaf and smell it.  The Chinese celery should smell like the regular celery. Cilantro has a strong smell, a bit like those tiny stinkbugs (to me anyway).|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Okay I googled it and yes they do look a bit alike, but not that much alike.    Chinese celery still looks like celery we are used to but thinner wich is what is is. A thinner celery and from what I read has a stronger celery flavor.    And chinese parlsey is just another form of parsley.     I'm not really sure why you would think they are so interchangable.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Parsley and Celery do not look alike.  An both have a different taste and used different ways; no matter if they are american, chinese or whatever.|`|HEEXkiihaa	chinese celery has a stronger taste and smell than chinese parsley.its also longer, bigger and less leaves as compared to parsley. i just used them for chinese new year a week ago.|`|7810b482021aa21d7006247d38601648aa	chinese parsley is often called cilantro and used in mexican cooking. actually its just a weed and you can grow it easily at home. im not sure what chinese celery is, but im sure its different from chinese parsley.  suki

gwArghvfaa	Hmm... well you can probably get more of the protein from the eggs, or from things like tofu and beans. I would say just be vegetarian (because I think you can still eat eggs, I occasionally do). But if chicken makes up most of your diet, by all means, be a pollotarian! I think its pretty cool!|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	why can't you just call yourself a person who doesn't eat red meat!? that name is very annoying to the ear(or my ear at least). and it sounds bogus.|`|JPssvCAvaa	Nothing wrong with eating just chicken as your protein.    So long as you also eat vegetables and fruit.    Eat what you enjoy and stop worrying about it.     Please do not try to categorize yourself.     There are enough weird political parties and religions without foodies doing it too.|`|NKKiaC3Naa	Wrong category. This is Vegetarian & Vegan, not Pescetarian & Pollotarian.|`|IegOHQXOaa	1. Don't listen to any negative answers, your question is perfectly understandable.   2. The only person who can make that decision is you. A Pollotarian diet it still a healthy one for sure but are you only going to be a pollorarian just because of your worries about getting enough protein? If that's the one of the reasons then in my opinion you should go full out vegetarian because there are plenty of protein enriched foods that never come from an animal and supplements that will give you the protein you need and can  even sneak into foods without noticing the taste.     3. If you're being worried about cutting out chicken from your diet and you WANT to- do it in steps. Slowly decrease the amount you eat until you're down to none, then when ever a craving hits you can substitute chicken with one of the many awesome chicken replacements out there. This is coming from a girl who was a heavy meat eater. This may not be true for everyone but- it's easier than you think once you get started.   Another way to ween yourself off of chicken is to be proud of yourself! Think of the times you turned away from eating an animal product- it feels good! You were strong enough to let it go!   5- Be careful- a picky vegetarian can sometimes end up being an unhealthy vegetarian.     Good luck! And remember to take your vegetarian multivitamins they help more than you think.|`|0TcJdaAGaa	no you should become a vegitarian instead becuz u can eat beans for protein|`|cxKyHIquaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

You could thicken some with gelatin or corn flour and put it on to a biscuit crumb base, like a cheese cake.

sZFLtCbdaa	While water made not go stale in a typical fashion. It can smell and taste funky if not stored properly. It develops a rotten egg smell due to algae build up. It might even upset the stomach, but not kill you.  Light is the greatest enemy to stored water. Sun light being the biggest enemy. I have stored water for 3 years in total darkness and drank it because light never came into contact with it.  If you want to store water, add 1/2 teaspoon of bleach, non scented to a gallon of water. Store it in a dark area and it will be safe to drink years down the road. If you store it anywhere where light can get to it, then maybe it will be safe to drink for up to a year without smelling like rotten eggs. If it has a funky smell, boil it and let it cool down then you can drink it.  Note: All municipal water (city, town) has algae in it. It will not hurt you because it is in very small amounts. Sometimes in the summer when you open the tap to get a glass of water, you will notice a funny smell. That is what happens with stored water also. That funky smell.    Note: Stored water does not absorb toxins.|`|KKdUWNY3aa	...no. water is thoroughly nonperishable.|`|vt8tazGdaa	uh, your kidding, right?|`|RSbn5STjaa	Yes - 3 days.|`|kGTvJS4paa	The water itself does not go stale, but the container it's in will.

During this step, preheat your regular oven to 350.    Mixing Pecan Pie Filling    Mixing Pecan Pie Filling     Step two: Mixing    Mix together in the mixing bowl:    1 Cup White Corn Syrup    1 Cup Brown Sugar    1/3 Teaspoon Salt    1/3 Cup Melted Butter    1 Teaspoon Vanilla         Beating Eggs for Pecan Pie    Beating Eggs     Step Three: Eggs    Mix (slightly beat) eggs until they look like the ones shown in the picture to the left.    Pouring Eggs into Pecan Pie Filling    Adding Eggs     Step Four: Add Eggs    Add the  eggs to the batter and stir until the batter looks as it did before you added the eggs.    Pecan Pie DoughPecan Pie CrustCutting Pecan Pie Crust    Pie Crust     Step Five: Pecan Pie Crust    Take your pie dough out of the refrigerator, and roll it out till it looks like the picture at the left. It should be about 1/8 of an inch in thickness. Then, apply more flour to the rolling pin. Wrap the dough around the rolling pin, and unroll it onto your pie pan. Cut the excess crust off around the edge of the pie pan so that the crust hangs 1 inch around the edge. We use a pan with a gully around the edge to catch anything that overflows.    Folding Edge of Pecan Pie Crust    Folding edge Under     Step Six: Create The Pie Crust Edge    Pinch around the edge of the pie dough so that it folds in half. If you did not leave a one inch border, you will not have enough dough to do this. If this happened to you, just take it out of the pan and roll it out again properly.    Pinching Edge of Pecan Pie CrustPinching Edge of Pecan Pie CrustPecan Pie Crust    Pecan Pie Crust     Step Seven: Pinching  Edge    Now, go around the edge and pinch it as shown here to create a wave shape. This is an important step; it will impact the final look of your pie. Work with it a little to get the look you see at the left.        Pouring Filling into Pecan Pie     Step Eight: Filling    Pour the pecan pie filling into pie shell.    Adding Roastd Pecans to Pecan Pie    Sprinkling Roasted Pecans     Step Nine: Roasted Pecans    Sprinkle the 2 cups of roasted pecans on top of the pecan pie filling. Some pecans will sink into the filling; while, others will remain on top. Now, put your pie in a preheated oven set to 350F for 1 hour to an hour and 10 minutes.    Foil around Pecan Pie    Foil     Step Ten: Foil    After the pie has been in the oven for about 30 minutes, take it out, and put strips of tinfoil around the edge to keep the pie crust from burning. Be careful not to spill you pie! The filling is runny and quite hot. Then, put the pie back in the oven.    Test     Step Eleven: Testing Pie    After you put the pie back in the oven, it will need another 30 to 40 minutes. After about 30 minutes (a total of 1 hour in the oven) test the pie to see if it is done. You can test the pie by sticking a knife in the middle. If the knife comes out clean, the pie is done; if it comes out dirty, it needs about 10 more minutes in the oven.    Pecan Pie         Enjoy your masterpiece!|`|tP2lPrH9aa	Yes i would(: but sadly i have no pecan pie recipe:(
1d2693edcdb7a027a27683d1e8dc3563aa	If you have a crockpot, 4 to 5 hrs should be sufficient to properly cook that amount of pork to shred or pull apart    If you plan on using the oven - I recommend roasting pork for 40-50 min at 385 to 395*F uncovered, then cover pan with foil & lower heat to 275 to 295*F & continue to roast for about 3 1/2 to 4 hrs - checking for doneness|`|KgtlyWDXaa	I would plan on 12-15 hours on low setting.

I usually put mine in the slow cooker early in the morning and after 8 hours I just check it.  Shred a little bit and taste it.  If you want it more tender let it go a couple more hours.  If it is tender enough shred it all.  Turn your slow cooker down to low to keep it warm until ready to serve.  After it's shredded check it every 30 min to make sure it is not drying out.  Give it a stir and add moisture(sauce, stock, water) as needed.  Enjoy!

It is a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Alcohol is metabolized in the liver by enzymes; however, the liver can only metabolize a small amount of alcohol at a time, leaving the excess alcohol to circulate throughout the body. The intensity of the effect of alcohol on the body is directly related to the amount consumed.     This taught me very well.

AA12336927	they don't usually pop, but hey, go for it. A kernel saved is a kernel earned|`|XHnpraaxaa	I am sure if you read your package it tells you not to do this.  Does not anyone read?|`|hT7BhNamaa	I doubt it very much that would work.|`|yCR6qg0baa	No. First of all, putting corn kernels in the microwave in a bowl, they'd go EVERYWHERE! Also, usually the ones that don't pop in the microwave will not pop if re-heated. You could try heating them over medium-high heat in a medium pot (with lid) on the stove. Use about a Tbsp of vegetable oil for heating. Swish the pot around over the burner until all the kernels are popped.|`|AA10565336	To your question, certainly.  It is no trick at all to take the unpopped kernels of corn out of the sack.  It is equally simple to save said kernels.  Placing them in a bowl is not brain surgery and putting them in the microwave can be done by most 10 year old children.    The trick is getting them to pop the second time around.  Corn will not pop if it doesn't have the moisture to expand and cause the kernel to essentially explode.  If it failed the first time it will almost certainly fail the second and/or subsequent times.  The second time through I would expect one or two kernels out of every hundred to pop.  Additionally I would expect those that do to be tough and taste burnt.    Bottom line, I think you are wasting your time but it is your time and what you suggest is relatively harmless, so GO FOR IT.  Give it a try, you never know, all I know is what I have read about how and why popcorn works and I have extrapolated from that.|`|APNB4OfIaa	Sure you can do it, but don't expect to get a bowl of popped corn.|`|pKIIOuyLaa	NO, Dont I have tried lol and it didnt trn out well  I put them in the microwave and they exploded and the smell of burnt popcorn was everywhere just buy a new pack|`|E5yWi6O3aa	No- once the kernals have been heated and cooled, the chemistry will not allow them to pop anymore. If you put them back in the microwave, they will just burn.|`|7357c14d424d74d2902bf92a9f79e915aa	why would you want to...popcorn is cheap, buy a new pack.|`|tvo3qgtzaa	No you can not it will not pop now.
1wNsBNmxaa	yes i would my mom all ways buys day old meat from the store all the time in if it is cooked it will last 2 or 3 days in the fridge or the freezer it will last up to 2 weeks longer    Graveworm66~~~?|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Yes, some sales are just to attract you into the store.    I buy the "managers special, or reduced for quick sale" meat all the time. I can't afford much and usually if you use or freeze it that day you are all good to go. These products are not past thier sell by date but are close. In the case of beef I think it is better. Beef is better when it ages.|`|hLohtlPEaa	Yes, but I would not freeze it. If it's only a day old I cook it that day.|`|XHnpraaxaa	NOPE... I seen where they sell day old and it looks like.....  No way would I want to serve that to anyone and I sure would not eat it.  It gets brown and looks disgusting.  They are out to make money no matter what.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	I buy "special" meats all the time.  They usually expire a day or two after I purchase them so I either use them right away or mark "use immediately" with a marker on the package and freeze it.  That way, I know not to let it stay thawed in the fridge for too long.  I have never found a difference in the taste from these specials.  My latest find was fillet mignon for $3.99/lb.  We had a great dinner that night!|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	No way, have tried it a few times, only to open the package to sticky meat. I would rather pay $2 more, for something fresh, especially, chicken or pork.|`|YwaZMnnGaa	I WOULD IF THERE WAS FECES ON IT.|`|zuswGKZfaa	If it is at a reputable grocery store or butcher, sure.  It isn't bad - just closer to the expiration date/they overbought... take a good look at the meat and you can always ask the butcher why it is on special!|`|117abff9116e3a46733b70216ee24e7aaa	The date should be good.It means u eat it that day or freeze it. Meat  can make you sick so check the date and it should be ok.|`|98lD3z68aa	I used to look for dark brown beef in the overkept (used meat) bin at Albertson's.  I like aged beef and it's not much for sale in Florida, so that was one way to find it.  Of course, proper dry aging is 21 days in a cool temperature.|`|96YWEYtlaa	I would buy meat on special only if it looks good to eat and the expiration date isn't relatively soon.    A lot of different grocery stores put meat on special as advertisements. For example:    Winn-Dixie (southern grocery store) is known for having very good quality meat. They bring in a lot of customers with their meat sales and buy-one-get-one free meat sales. It may be very cheap on special, but it's also fresh. I always buy my meat from this store.    (I'm a cashier at Winn-dixie, and can't really speak for Publix.) Although my experience shopping at Publix is that their meat isn't that good. I bought ground beef ONCE (never again). The next day, it was turning brown in my fridge. :/|`|oPRmgyXzaa	"managers special", or "reduced for quick sale" meat needs to be moved because of the "sale by date" on the packages. i personally dont like to buy it if im not going straight home to cook it.|`|9CN0otoQaa	Yes.

mlmSRkhGaa	The meal isnt well balanced.  Youre getting a serving of beans (soy burger) some fruits, and one green vegetable.  The koolaide is pointless.

You can type in the ingredients that you want to use in the search engine.    Here is the URL link:    http://www.foodnetwork.com/quick-and-eas...    Here are my simple suggestions, too.    If  you have flat breads, tortillas, or even bagels, then  I would eat those with a combination of spreads and roasted vegetables.   Toast the flat bread, tortilla, or Bagel, in the oven or toaster.     Choose a Spread.  Add vegetables as an option.   For spreads, try hummus, white bean dip, or melted cheese  or cream cheese variation(if you are not vegan). You can add roasted vegetables in the following way.     Fast-Roasted Vegetables    Pre-Heat oven 450.     Chop up a variety of fresh vegetables and onions (any of your favorites) into large pieces. I'd recommend any combination of onions, red peppers, bell peppers,zucchini, squash, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, eggplants.     Then line a baking sheet with aluminum foil coat with either a thin layer of olive oil or cooking oil spray.     Add the vegetables in a single layer. Coat with salt & pepper.     Spray with cooking spray once more. Then cover with another sheet of aluminum Foil.        Timer: 20 minutes. Check the vegetables using a potholder to lift the foil off the vegetables. Wait until the vegetables begin to brown at the edges then remove the vegetables and enjoy as a tortilla & hummus sandwich or with flat bread.       I enjoy eating celery, pretzels, and apples with variation of cashew butter and peanut butter.  (Obviously, this isn't a recipe, but it's easy for a fast meal).    Roasted Potatoes with Garlic    This is a variation of the roasted vegetables.   Pre-heat the stove to 450.     Quarter  6 small  red potatoes  into 1/2 inch pieces. Put potatos into a oven-safe backing dish, which has been greased with olive oil, and add potatoes in a single layer.    Salt & Pepper  the potatoes - Add 4 cloves of garlic. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.    Bake 30 minutes. Check with potholder to see if they potatoes are browned along all edges. If they are not browned - wait another 15 minutes and check on 15 minute intervals until potatoes edges are beginning to  brown..     I enjoy these alone with ketchup or with roasted vegetables.|`|TQyjybRRaa	no way im a vegetarian!!!

What your parents thin is best for you at this point unless they are making you do something illegal.    And anyone, robot, monkey or robotmonkey who tells you to rebel against and defy your parents and act like a small child throwing a tantrum is stupid. Yeah, that's a good way to let your parents to think you are responsible and old enough to make some decisions,    What you should do is sit your mother down and talk to her calmly. tell her why you don't want to eat meat anymore. Explain to her how and what you feel. Maybe compromise that you will still eat eggs and not eliminate meat entirely but only eat it once week. After this gradual change, maybe they won't even notice that you aren't really eating meat anymore. Especially if you are healthy. Maybe even ask her to help you choose certain foods that all of you can enjoy.   satisfied|`|nDOWKhwCaa	Your parents pretty much own you until you are 18.

If she's doing that AND going to another bar then there may be a bit of a prob.<br>  <br>  Otherwise going to another place to 'wind down' is not a bad thing.  How is that different than Joe / Jane Average going to a pub for a pint after a hard day of work?|`|1uvrkDWNaa	No, when I was a bartender I used to go for drinks with my coworkers elsewhere. We didn't like drinking at the same place we worked.|`|zf1OxlYvaa	normally a bartender does not drink at work so it seems normal to go else where to drink after work even if its late at night|`|2UNPFl6qaa	This is a pretty common thing.  All of the bartenders I have worked with over the years (as well as the wait staff and the kitchen staff) do this.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't think that this habit alone constitutes a problem.  There are numerous other criteria to examine to determine if a drinking problem exists.<br>  <br>  My only thought here is the drinking during the shift.  Are these drinks being paid for, or are they being pinched behind the management's back?|`|rg2qMxT5aa	well maybe, but she surely does NOT want to do<br>  it at her own job, as she could get the owner in trouble<br>  with the law/abc board.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	No it is a sign she enjoys boozing, she probably hates her boss and wants to get drunk .|`|7DG99jUnaa	that the best way never lime were you work.but check your self you could develop a drinking problem.|`|cmvum8YDaa	no...she probably dont wanna drink where she works...|`|7cUDstdjaa	No, likely had a busy shift and would like to relax a bit before venturing elsewhere.<br>  I've done bar work in the past and had a few small (half pints) while I worked, but always welcomed a drink when I had finished my shift as I found the need to unwind.<br>  When you have spent 4 or 5 hours having to smile and be nice to people, it's the only way to retain your sanity. I am by no means an alcoholic, but having had to deal with loads who are is quite stressful.|`|cPuicv06aa	As the saying goes, business and pleasure doesn't usually work well, so she's probably going to another bar for a change of scenery.  If you look at other behavior in addition to this, one could consider this person having an alcohol problem.  I thought it was against the rules to drink @ work, especially at a bar.  This could certainly cloud her judgment and she could easily over-serve the wrong person.  Not too bright!

rsTB7D1zaa	It is somewhat hard to figure out if someone has been drinking by a phone call.  You can fairly easily figure out if they're really drunk or not, but a little bit of drinking would be really hard to tell.  On a phone conversation, I sound completly normal even after 4 or 5 drinks, and I can't tell if my friends have been drinking unless they've had about 5 drinks as well (usually its much more than this, and 3am... I just have fun with it).    Anyways, obvious clues are slurred speech, altered voice, and unnatural speech pattern.  You might say all the words right, but your voice sounds off, or maybe you have to pause at awkward spots to avoid mistalking.  More obvious would be incohorent sentences, and a general confusion -- asking you to repeat everything and then being able to answer questions with little more than "I don't know."|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	There is a chance he could be, I'd say higher percentage than you would think.

dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	You body houses an ecosystem of benificial organisms and bacteria. Its called the flora of the gut, and without it you cannot properly digest food.     The bacteria in yogurt is needed. you can get it from other sources, but not in as pure and useful a form as yogurt. The diets of most people does not include the bacteria needed for a balanced gut. Typically most americans have too much yeast in their systems, which is the opposite of the bacteria. You need the yeast as well, but too much doesnt help, and without enough of the healthy bacteria its no good.    Some of those yogurts are a gimmik, but any live yogurt is going to be good for you.|`|Mj1IoGblaa	Yes|`|GhLcKwmYaa	yes|`|AAn9cfAnaa	Disgusting as it may be, they ARE good for you.

CATALINA CHICKEN:   From DontH8Me  http://www.city-data.com/forum/recipes/2...    "Catalina Chicken from the thighs and legs - separate them and skin them before baking to keep the fat down, if you prefer. The recipe I use is typically for a whole chicken, so I would substitute 4 - 5 legs and thighs in this case.    Take the cleaned pieces and put them in a rectangular glass baking dish. Mix one small or 1/2 large bottle of Catalina Island French salad dressing with one envelope of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix. At this stage, depending on your preference, you could add to the pan of chicken any of the following: Onions, 1 inch dice, red/green/yellow bell pepper, 1 inch dice, and/or pineapple tidbits. Pour the sauce mix over the whole thing and swirl it around to coat all the pieces. Cover with foil to keep moist.    Bake in a 375 degree oven until the chicken juices run clear. You will want to make a batch of fluffy rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce from the chicken bake. My family loves this recipe and it takes less than 5 minutes to prep."    8. Campbell's Tasty 2-Step Chicken-5 Star recipe:  http://www.campbellkitchen.com/recipedet...    Ingredients:  1 tbsp. vegetable oil   4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves  1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell's? Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular, 98% Fat Free, 25% Less Sodium or Healthy Request?)  1/2 cup water     Directions:  Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes until it's well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet.    Stir the soup and water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Return the chicken to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.    Serving Suggestion: Serve with steamed whole green beans with sliced almonds and white rice. For dessert serve fresh red grapes.    9.

2GbTLiNeaa	Go in there and check out the Asian aisle or sauce section.  If it's not there, then go to Wal-Mart or Sam's Clup in the same sections mentioned above.

84W8ff0paa	That's the biggest problem with new veggies- you have to learn to veg*anize your old foods or replace them with new ones instead of reducing your diet to the things you already eat that are veg*an.    I suggest that you browse some vegan or vegetarian food blogs to get some ideas and start shopping with protein in mind. Tofu, tempeh, seitan, quinoa, and beans are all really good sources of protein. Soybeans as well as many other beans are actually a good source of complete proteins, which is awesome.    As far as ready-made meals, boca's prime grillers are good, as well as morning star's premium patties. Keep in mind that these aren't necessarily good for you as they are high in preservatives and the like, but they get the job done. I may be mistaken, but i think the entire Amy's line is vegetarian and a lot of it is vegan (their vegan pizza is out of this world!). Their indian dishes are phenomenal, btw.      Be sure to actually drink that soymilk or start taking a multivitamin. Soymilk is fortified with things we need like iron and calcium, as we get those in smaller doses than omnis. If you'd rather get those in your diet, dark leafy greens are an excellent source of both. Spinach, broccoli and kale have both, and kale also has lots of protein (which is why it's such a staple in the vegan diet-its also tasty!).     Oh and don't worry, the parents always come around. It took mine a while, but they've gotten used to their "little tree hugger" *eyeroll*|`|3wWGjj4naa	going veggie can be good for you...but it seems like ur taking in alot of carbs... watch all those pbjs they arent good for u although the pb has protien...make sure ur pastas and breads are whole wheat, eat salads with romain lettuce not iceburg b.c it has no nutrition...and make sure u buy OJ with added calcium or soy milkiwth added calcium get lots of fruits and veggies and eat beans and nuts to keep tht protien up... take supplements like a daily vitaman and tlk to your doctor about getting enough protien thts one of the hardest things for vegetarians to get and to keep in balance.. this is really important and imbalance can result in anemia... which makes ur tired and weak... good luck  oh and if ur parents dont approve show them how much better your life can be by being vegetarian... and dont just eat junk :)|`|wqW53kWDaa	Don't worry, mine didn't approve at first either. The bigh thing non-vegetarians try to pound in is protine. You need about a quarter of what meat eaters get, unless you are a body builder. I would suggest peanut butter, but besides jelly try some honey or bananas on it. Eat lots of fruit, try different things on your salads, try fake meats, whole grain pasta with marinara, you don't say if you're a vegan or lacto/ovo vegetarian, so you'll have to tailor these to you, but just some basic ideas. A day for me is like this (I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian):    Breakfast- cold cereal and milk.    Lunch- Peanut butter sandwich, banana, grapes, fruit bar, granola bar, piece of candy and water    Dinner- baked potatoe with butter and milk    Snacks- granola bar, cereal, chocolate kisses, candies, salad etc|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	Sweetie. You are not a vegan for not drinking milk. you cannot eat eggs or milk if you were a vegan. And there are plenty of milk and eggs in some foods you eat but the are mixed in. EX- cookies  I hope you are not a vegintarian to lose weight. That is a ridiculous reason. I will actaully make you deficient in vitamins if you don't eat the right foods. Research it.

The Daily Nutritional Guide Pyramid for Filipino Adults developed by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology recommends 2-3 servings of fruits (1 serving = 1 medium size or 1 slice of big fruit) to meet the daily requirement.  This means 2-3 pieces of banana a day provide 20-30 grams of carbohydrate and 80-120 kilocalories.         Fruits & vegetables    The fruit of a plant contains its seeds: apples, pears, peaches, oranges, bananas, mangoes, kiwis, cucumbers, and tomatoes are examples of fruits. Yes, cucumbers and tomatoes are fruits! Technically, a tomato is a berry, like a grape.    Vegetables are generally everything else -- the leaves, stalks, stems (including tubers), roots, etc.     anything with seeds is a fruit and anything without them is a vegetable.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana
pU72Rscdaa	Hi Ernst    Many people are wondering about the miracle fruit vs. miracle fruit tabs (tablets.)    First, let me explain how the tabs are made.  Raw miracle fruit is processed by machine and the skin and seed are removed, leaving only the pulp.    Here, it is dried and combined with a little natural corn starch to hold it together.  Finally, it is shaped into a pill form and packaged.    Are the tabs as potent/effective as the raw fruit?  Definitely, in fact, more so.  Each tab contains about as much active ingredient as 3 berries since there is no water in the tabs.    I highly recommend the tabs over the fruit since they are more potent, less expensive and last months as compared to days with the fruit.|`|96YWEYtlaa	First of all, if you're buying these tablets online, PLEASE go to google and check whether or not it's a scam. I've had a lot of experience double-checking a lot of supplements online that my dad has tried to order, and found that a lot of them were scams.    Second, miracle berries are actually little berries that grow on a bush that, if eaten (and you suck on the large seed on the inside), can let you eat sour things and have them taste sweet. (You can lick a lemon slice after having a miracle berry and it'll taste like candy.) I have two bushes of them. :D I've never heard anything about them being good for you.    Third, I have found that the only berry that has helped people is the acai berry. Many of my friends have tried a drink called Mona Vie, and said it made them feel much healthier. However, Mona Vie doesn't have that much acai juice in it. Acai berries have some crazy amount of antioxidants in them, much higher than blueberries pound-for-pound.    Whatever supplement you find, make SURE you double check it through google to see if it's a scam.

aNlT1NRqaa	Everyone's different. I'll use me as an example.    I'm 5'10, I used to weigh 200 , and didn't exercise. When I was healthier, I weighed 160, but was kinda scrawny. I first gave up soda & lost 10  in less than 1 month. Then I stopped eating out & cooking at home & lost about 10  in less than a month. Then I started walking and lost another 10  in about 1 month. Then I got a gym membership, and lost a little over 10  in about 2 weeks. I leveled out @ 155, but felt I was too scrawny, so with exercise & a little more food I've leveled out @ 170 (now more muscle, but about 5  extra fat - oh, well) and I've stayed there for 5 years.    Crash diets don't work. Go slow & stay relatively comfortable (eat bad food in moderation as a treat) & it shouldn't be hard. Don't rush it.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	It depends on a few things. How much soda do you drink? Are you still going to eat whole fruit? You still need whole fruit.    The key for loosing wieght is eat less and move more. Keep a food journal and total your calories 3 or 4 tmes a day. I did my best weight loss when I stayed between 1200-1500 calories daily.    Just drinking water will not put you down to your ideal wieght you really need to make lifestyle/eating habit changes. BIG TIME.|`|XboNFF4maa	One thing juice is not bad for you, as long as it does not have high fructose or any kind of super processed sugar, if you buy organic pure juice you will not gain weight because your body can take it, so you don't need to cut it out. You should not think that if you switch to water that you will lose weight you may want to change your diet, stay away from super processed food, no trans fat and you should be good, you don't need to give up juice to lose weight but do stay away from soda.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	NO WAY TO KNOW.  first off, you could lose nothing if you replace those calories with food calories.  and even if you don't, you didn't say how much soda/juice you have been drinking, so are you cutting out 100 calories a day or 1000 by doing this?  soda and sugary juices are empty calories so cutting them out is a good start, but it is important to determine your daily calorie expenditure (BMR + activty) and how many calories you take in.  create a 500-1000 calorie deficit a day ( never go below your BMR) you will lose 1-2lbs a week.  i suggest increasing your activty as well to see quick results and build muscle with weight training so that you are toned.|`|zpvghRrJaa	just excersice, drink milk

BTW its February ...Tomorrow and you must be a Steelers fan  Go Cards!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	You could make up some ribs, wings, dips and chips, deviled eggs, pickles, brats and mustard-kraut-b-b-q sauce etc... 7 layer dip, mini burgers, veggie trays, meat and cheese trays, there are even min dogs and mini corn dog these days, meat balls, cheese dip and so on.     Here is how I do my wings.    When making wings I like to bake them first then fry them.    Cut the tips off then cut at the next joint. Bake at 350 for about 20-30 minutes or until they are done. You can add them to the sauce of your choice now or fry them for about 2-3 minutes to get them real nice and crispy, drain the toss in your sauce.    Also I like to bake mine first because then I can keep some in the fridge and/or freezer and then just drop them in hot oil to warm and crisp up.    To make hot sauce. Here in the US there is a brand that is pretty common to start with. It is Franks Red Hot, doctor it up a bit and you end with with a good sauce. Here is how I doctor mine up.    1 big bottle franks  1/2 cup butter  1-2 tablespoons itailian seasoning  1-2 cloves grated garlic-optional    Heat in sauce pan. I like to cool mine to about room temp then put it in food processor until it cools a little more. This makes it combine better for reheating.    This also keeps well in an air tight conatiner in the fridge.  ---------------    Or This is my Absolute Favorite for WIngs:    Honey Soy:    1/2 cup butter  1 cup honey  1 cup soy sauce  1 cup terriyaki sauce  1 tbsp seseme oil  1 tsp fresh grated ginger    Heat in a sauce pan until melted and combined. Keep unused portion in the fridge in an airtight container. Heat a little for each use.  --------------  I love salsa and sour cream mixed together, or my grandmother does the whole rotel tomato, velveeta and hamburger dip thing.  --------  Chili Lime Shrimp with Creamy Chipotle Dip:  2 limes  24 uncooked extra large shrimp, peeled and deviened-with shells on about 1 1/2 lbs  2 tbsp olive oil  1 clove garlic finely chopped  1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes  1/3 cup mayo  2 tbsp honey mustard  1 large chipotle chile in adobo sauce-finely chopped  1 tsp adobo sauce  1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro    Reserve 1 lime for garnish. Grate 1 tsp peel form other lime. Cut lime in 1/2 and squeeze, enough juice to measure 2 tbsp. Set peel and juice aside    Butterfly each shrimp. (cut lengthwise along outside of shrimp without cutting all the way thru-the shrimp should lay flat open)    In 1 gallon resalable plastic bag mix oil, garlic, shrimp, pepper flakes, lime juice, and grated lime peel. Refrigerate 30-60 min to marinate.    Meanwhile in small bowl mix mayo, honey mustard, chipotle pepper, and adobo sauce. Cover and refrigerate until serving.    Heat oven to 400 degrees, Remove shrimp from marinade, place in a 15x10x1 baking dish. Open each shrimp arranging in pan so that the cut portionis on pan with tail tucked in. Toss marinade.    Bake 5-7 min rearranging shrimp 1/2 way thru bake time, until shrimp are pink. Place on serving dish sprinkle with cilantro. Spoon dip into bowl.

Heat oven to 425. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. In medium bowl mix orange juice, brown sugar, orange peel,ginger, and garlic. Add scallops and toss to coat.    2. Place 1 scallop in each mushroom cup. Wrap each with 1 slice bacon, enclosing the scallop. Secure with a toothpick, Dip in orange juice mix and place on pan.    3. Bake 8 to 10 min or until mushrroms are tender, scallops are opaque, and bacon is crispy.    4 If desired replace each toothpick with a wooden skewer.    ***Either buying pre-cooked bacon or pre-cooking it your self helps that bacon brown nicely in the oven.

Football fans are the most satisfying snackers to cook for. They love anything that's savory, easy to eat, and delicious. You can make them even happier by setting up this easy appetizer buffet and then just standing back!   Junk food is required at a party like this one. By junk food, I mean those delicious, crunchy, fat-laden recipes that everyone loves and almost no one serves anymore. Watching great football games is a definite excuse to break any diet and enjoy yourself! And the guys probably don't care about a diet anyway.     Mix and match your buffet from the following selection, or take a look at my Appetizer Recipe Box. Enjoy the party. Have a wonderful time with your friends, kick back and relax - and I hope your team wins!     Guacamole   Rich Tomato-Cheese Dip   Veggie Quesadillas   Mini Pizzas   Baked Artichoke Dip   Barbecued Chicken Drummies   Caramelized Onion Focaccia   BLT Dip   Buffalo Chicken Wings   Spicy Crockpot Chicken Drummies   Cherry Orange Snack Mix   Layered Pizza Dip   Layered Reuben Spread   Layered Taco Dip   New Buffalo Chicken Wings   Original Original Chex Party Mix   Crockpot Onion Meatballs   Praline Cherry Munch   Crockpot Snack Mix   Sausage Cheese Balls   Spicy Pecans   Swedish Nuts   Sweet And Sour Meatballs   Gingerbread Caramel Corn       MORE TIPS:     Dips are absolutely necessary. Any kind of meat - whether meatballs simmering in a slowcooker, chicken wings, sandwiches that are easy to eat with one hand - are required. Snack mixes will fill any chinks left over - and some easy desserts should be included.     Beverages are extremely important to any Super Bowl party. The demands of your guests, of course, are paramount. Root Beer, pop, (dare we mention sparkling water?), punches, and coffee should fill most needs. Just have lots of drinks - and even more ice.     One great idea is to have two party rooms going. Apparently, nothing is more annoying to serious fans than those who want to talk during the game. So if you designate one room "real fans only" and another "come here to talk and party" (see An Anti-Super Bowl Party), you'll make everybody happy.     I would definitely suggest paper utensils for this party. Paper plates, paper napkins, paper cups (all in team colors if you want to be fancy) make cleanup a snap and will put everyone in a more relaxed mood.     Also consider keeping a cooler full of ice and beverages near the seating areas. Fill them with a huge selection of canned and bottled drinks and everybody will be happy.     Make sure the food table is set up out of the way of the action. Have crockpots, warming plates, and trays full of ice ready to go to keep hot food hot and cold food cold.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	After 20 + years as a former professional chef and having worked all over the world due to my health and physical conditions was instructed by a Homoeopathic doctor to cut out certain foods, so I became a lacto-ovo vegetarian, I only eat egg whites and yougart is my only dairy product, one thing I have learned with being a vegetarian or vegan it is like either your religious beliefs or political views, it is your business and opinions are fine but draw the line, as the first person said be polite and just say "No Thank you, I am not able to eat that", no sense being rude or getting on a soapbox to echo the virtues of vegetarianism, just be as tactful as possible, people will be more responsive and not be as abrasive.|`|j6vsBzuSaa	say" thank you so much, but i cannot accept this, im on a very specail diet,of which i dont eat the contents of this, but thankyou for the gesture|`|rSSQFbviaa	Gently explain to her that you are a vegetarian.

At another time, when you're talking with a friend or family member, casually mention what you can and can't eat without reminding them of their gift to you. I think your boyfriend's mother would understand, since she's in the same boat, but saying something to someone who gives you a gift would be rude.      I would just keep giving it away like you have been.  (You're very thoughtful)  Hope this helps!  :)

3FOmoaUZaa	Actually, in Europe, the sheep r killed and skinned for the wool.|`|5O7op0oIaa	Vegans, being earth-loving hippy types with aversions to razors, do not really need to wear wool. They're generally so hairy and unkempt that you couldn't distinguish them from a chimp, but at least it keeps them warm.    Some of the answers in this thread make me question the future of humanity. And not in a good way.      Take this,    "Sheep get treated like CRAP in the production of wool and cashmere. You should check that out."    Evidence, please?    I grew up in a farming community. I know how sheep live. It's a fairly boring, natural, sedate life, and they are seldom troubled by the shears. And certainly not just for winter, as some other muppet suggested. You can see this yourselves, simply by looking at the fields.      Sheep are wooly in winter, and shaven in summer. Good for the sheep, good for us.    Reallly, people...|`|dzuiWVZjaa	and plus they only get sheared in winter, back in the days before purchasing the wool why do u think they did it? so they werent too hot and die from dehydration thats y they grow it back in winter.    some do some dont wear it but its not actually killing the animal so id ont see why not|`|EEE6DAClaa	you never know, they're pretty weird|`|dlSjuihjaa	No we don't wear wool.  I personally see it as stealing; it is okay to shave a sheep if it's hot but making a coat out of it's hair is just rude.|`|VnK7sTHKaa	Hello,    the thing is that some may say that not wearing wool is a bit extreme and the animals aren't being killed for the wool so it is okay (this could be true, although it is repulsive the way they do it), however, think....vegans. Vegans don't drink milk, and cows aren't killed when they are being milked, although it is painful and cruel and so vegans don't drink it. So think of wool as the same as milk. Basically if you can accept the reason for vegans not drinking milk, then it should be easy to see why they don't wear wool either.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I don't.    "You don't kill a sheep to get wool from it" - actually a lot of wool comes from dead sheep.|`|j6vsBzuSaa	well, im a vegan and i do not wear wool, i dont know about other vegans, but i for one definetely do not because the sheep lose their wool in the winter too, so they ahve got to be cold, plus, i think woolo is uncomfortable|`|iqHrzhYuaa	Most don't.    Sheep get treated like CRAP in the production of wool and cashmere. You should check that out.|`|3wWGjj4naa	no they dont wear wool.... but vegans are crazy so it doesnt matter|`|khXGGBiTaa	Generally, they don't purchase or wear anything which was once a part of an animal, or was created by either killing or in some way exploiting an animal. This includes fur, leather, sheep-skin, wool, silk, suede, mohair, alpaca, felt, snake-skin, etc.    There are a few possible reasons that a vegan might wear clothing made of one of those things. The first is that they are not really a vegan, just a vegetarian following a vegan (i.e. a strict vegetarian) diet and not a vegan lifestyle. The second is that they may have purchased (or been given) the clothing before becoming a vegan, and are continuing to use it until it wears out, rather than let it go to waste.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	I do, but I am, as Spiderman said, eating a vegan diet not living a vegan lifestyle.|`|KfCsjdrMaa	not usually. just because they aren't killed does not mean they aren't mistreated and abused.|`|KBvkGc6baa	no because the sheep are still treated barbarically and most wool comes from the slaughter house     and medium dave i live in the middle of the country side and the sheep here are fine but that's not the majority of them  and you never get to see the badly treated animals because they are kept in dark metal sheds  far away from where you would expect the animals to live

Brown the chuck roast (you don't have to, but it's better). I have a crock pot that I can put right on the stove so I don't have to dirty an extra pan. If you use a separate pan to brown the meat, remove the meat to the crock pot.     Add 3 large onions cut in quarters, 6 large stalks of celery cut in big pieces and a some baby carrots to the browning pan. Brown them a little bit and add them to the pot roast. Again, you don't have to brown the veggies either but it's better. The dish will be good without browning, just not as good, depends on how much time and effort you have.     Add a carton of beef stock to the crock pot til it's almost to the top of the roast. Cook until it's done. I cook it on high if I'm in a hurry or low if I'm gone all day. Start it in the morning, it's good to eat when you get home from work. It should cook at least six hours.     You can make a thick gravy or serve the juice just the way it is. You might have to add some boullion to make it taste good. This recipe is also good with beef cubes (stew meat) you just don't have to cook it as long.     I serve the roast with potatoes and carrots, you can add them to the crock pot close to the end or cook them separate.|`|56XDflaGaa	soup,stir fry|`|vMjbeQyFaa	Quick & easy pepper steak.

587fd4cd625f006ee81a9a15c035ab3aaa	There is  very little blood in the juice. The animals are bled at the slaughterhouse. Most  of the color of the juice is due to a protein, myoglobin, that is stored in the muscle (meat).    As requested below by another poster, here is more research.  Following is a  quote from the site:  http://knol.google.com/k/craig-goldwyn/m...    "It's not blood! I know a lot of folks like their meat well done, but it's a scientific fact that well done meat is tougher and drier than rare meat. Some are turned off by the red juice that is commonly called "blood". It is not blood and we should stop calling it blood. It is myoglobin, a protein. Just call it juice. At about 140F red meat begins to turn pink as the myoglobin begins to change. As the temperature rises above 140F myoglobin starts to go from pink to clear, and the meat turns tan. At that temp the meat starts to toughen as the proteins denature.

The thing coming out of your steak is not blood, it's actually what you said, "juice".|`|c9ZqOAk4aa	Having red or reddish "juice" coming out of steaks that are cooked medium or less is actually normal, and quite common. It may have been blood, but at most restaurants the steaks served are quite tender, and when grilled or char-broiled, produce the "juice" you saw when you cut it. It is normal, and considering the steak was cooked, it won't make you sick.|`|7810b482021aa21d7006247d38601648aa	yes it was blood. all meat has blood in it. if you took out all the blood and water in meat you would have beef jerky. i use to be a cook at a steakhouse and some people wanted their steak cooked extra well done which was easy. just burn it. one time i got tipped on a extra well done steak.  suki|`|kmf0UboWaa	no, it was the steak's "juice" or water that had absorbed some flavor and color form the beef.|`|ZLOBlTztaa	Some of those juices are probably blood, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Steak can safely be eaten medium rare or rare (although not blue) because the harmful bacteria are on the surface, which does get thoroughly cook.  Hamburgers must be cooked thoroughly because the ground meat has been all mixed up.|`|nJCzYIt0aa	if its liquid it is black but if it is dry it can be the blood that was cook and been frozen|`|Jv4dkGobaa	I thought that if you don't cook steak fully, there will always be blood coming out. I mean, what else can it be? Juice, hmm I don't think so. I think there needs to be some research there.
0ujpiBTCaa	I would much rather someone drink a black coffee then a Monster energy drink, particularly if this was an every day habit.|`|fscgp7iFaa	Monster gives people seizures coffee stunts your growth take your pick|`|4d3Md9pnaa	honestly, I think Monster probably is.  edit: 1 sip of Monster, one of my friends was insanely hyper.  1 sip of coffee...eh, not so much.|`|12xBKdkqaa	Monster has added sugars and chemicals whereas coffee is just loaded with caffeine. Both are bad for you, but coffee is less likely to give you Diabetes.|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	Caffeine has been both the subject of scrutiny and accolade ever since Starbucks opened its doorsand Red Bull gave us wings.    Despite one's opinion on how caffeine affects the body, it's clear this stimulant has a solid place in our on-the-go society and isn't going anywhere.    The important questions to ask are: "What caffeinated beverages provide the most amount of caffeine per serving, and which are the wisest choices for your wallet and waistline?"     Among the top two caffeine competitors today are coffee and energy drinks.    Of course, the list of energy drink brands existing on the market these days is virtually endless. Yet whether you're drinking a Monster, Red Bull or RockStar, it's safe to say you are consuming many of the same ingredients.     According to www.bevnet.com, the popular energy drinks listed above all contain ingredients like taurine, B-group vitamins, glucose and caffeine.    Taurine is a naturally-occurring amino acid that is released from the body in times of high stress and exertion, according to www.redbull.co.uk. Our body cannot reproduce sufficient amounts of it when it is released; hence its purpose in restoring our body temperature when we need it most. B-group vitamins help boost our metabolism by breaking down carbs, fats and proteins.     Glucose, or sugar, is perhaps the most common ingredient among energy drinks worldwide, accounting for the ominous amount of carbs and calories in the drinks.    So what about caffeine?    According to www.energyfiend.com, one 8.3 oz. can of original Red Bull contains 80 mg of caffeine, while one original 16 oz. can of RockStar or Monster contains 160 mg of caffeine per can.     The average energy drink costs anywhere from $1.99 to $3.00 depending on brand.    A cup a joe' on the other hand, ranges from .89 cents to $2.99, depending on distributor. Coffee also contains far less calories than energy drinks and fewer carbohydrates if you use Splenda or artificial sweetener in place of sugar. (Note: This applies to basic, brewed coffee; not any of that Starbucks mumbo jumbo.)|`|PvyYiy9baa	Well, it depends on the coffee drink.  Generally the answer would be monster because it is loaded with artificial and added stimulants, but those things could be added to coffee as well|`|vVUzDh8Caa	Coffee is better, Monster has artificial sugars and other terrible man made byproducts.|`|Av2LoDYQaa	i might have to say monster  i just has a ton of crap in it  monster has lots of different ingredients in it  while coffe isnt the best, its got some healthy sides to it  i dont know if im right or not  i just like reading bout things and the health oxes on the back of things (those boxes really do help, just a lot of people dont bother to read them)|`|LTA3DKN0aa	monster

1RjRDTw5aa	Well first of all, unless you have had really good drinking parties, I don't think you should be so worried about people sneaking in. Unless you are plannign to drink at your party, even if there are a few people you don't want there just tell your friends to be on the lookout for them and get someone older to kick them out. Seccondly, a really good ice breaker game is maybe a small game of water polo, usually it will be kindof quiet in the beginning, but people will warm up to eachother, especially if everybody knows eachother.

AleT38EYaa	I have always been super-frugal (don't have cable, cook most of my own food, don't buy bottled water, bike/walk or take public transport when I can, shop at consignment/discount stores, etc).  I don't know where I could cut back.      As a people, I think we need to begin investing in our communities.  Take public transportation when and where you can.  Not only will it save you money, it will also put money into the city to improve those services; without full patronization, such services are expensive.      Donate old books to your local library instead of throwing them out.      Clip coupons from your Sunday paper; it's FREE MONEY!    Prepare/cook your own food whenever possible; even the cost of frozen ready-to-steam broccoli is expensive compared to just buying the raw heads, washing, chopping and then steaming them.      Buy from Farmer's Markets instead of the supermarket (I just saw "Organic Broccoli from China" the other day . . . oxymoron anyone?)    Use canvas or re-usable bags for shopping instead of plastic bags    Take your lunch to work a few days a week instead of splurging at the local restaurant or cafeteria    Stock away what you can in your company's pre-tax 401k.  I know the market is sucky right now, but pre-tax is FREE MONEY, especially if your company offers a match.  Once things go back up, you will be one wealthy little kiddo    Find free, fun community activities to do.  Meetup.com is a great place to start and find cheap, entertaining ways to meet new people with common interests    This is the time we need to come together and help each other.

They do it because if they were to continue to give away this type of FREE let me say it again FREEEEE product they would loose out on operating costs and would again have to raise prices. Everyone complains about the cost of food going up. Did you ever think about the reason why cost of goods not only food goes up because minimal wage continues to go up. So companies need to raise prices in order to pay for employees and the products they sell. Don't be to hard on these people who work customer service jobs because I'm sure they have had to deal with 15 other bitc**s before you came along today. Look in your fridge at home I'm sure you can find something to use with your nuggets.

It's easy to prepare ahead of time, and the lemon juice gives the chicken a piquant, crispy taste that rivals that of any butter-basted bird. 1 whole lemon, halved 4 sprigs fresh rosemary.    FOR THE MARINADE:    2/3 c. freshly squeezed lemon juice  2 tbsp. olive oil  3 tbsp. crushed black peppercorns or coarsely ground pepper  4 tbsp. fresh, chopped rosemary or 2 tbsp. dried    Combine all ingredients for the marinade. Pour over the chicken and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or overnight.  Place the lemon halves and rosemary sprigs in the cavity of the chicken if a whole bird is used. Roast chicken in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes per pound. Do not open oven or baste chicken during roasting. If chicken is to be grilled, grill for approximately 20 minutes, turning once. Legs and thighs should be grilled an additional 5 minutes or until meat is not pink.    Serves 4.     enjoy, mar|`|3xNqFQMTaa	A classic roast chicken is sure to impress on a wintery Sunday.

Finally rub the skin with some Extra Virgin Olive Oil (since it's less likely to burn than butter) and season with your favorite spices.    Roast in the oven until juices run clear.  If you have some on hand, you can also toss a cup or so of chicken broth or white wine in the bottom of the pan for extra flavor when you make gravy.|`|AA12336927	if its not to close to the chicken and dumplings, do a chicken stew  This stew adapts well to a variety of substitutions. You can use seafood instead of chicken (add the seafood during the last few minutes of cooking). For a vegetarian option, just add a larger assortment of vegetables and use vegetable broth. It's also good served over rice.  Old-Fashioned Chicken and  Vegetable Stew  1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts  Salt  Freshly ground black pepper  Garlic powder  2 tablespoons canola oil  20 pearl onions  3 cloves garlic, minced  1 red pepper, cut into large squares  8 ounces mushrooms, thickly sliced  4 cups nonfat chicken broth  1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley  1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  1 bay leaf  1 cup baby carrots  1 parsnip, peeled and sliced  2 potatoes, cubed  1 yam or sweet potato, cubed  1 cup green beans, cut into 1" pieces  12 ounces yolk-free egg noodles  2 tablespoons arrowroot  2 tablespoons whole-grain flour  4 tablespoons water  1/2 cup nonfat sour cream    Cut the chicken into chunks and season well with the salt, black pepper and garlic powder.    Warm 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and brown for about 5 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.    In the same pot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the onions, garlic, red peppers and mushrooms. Cook for 5 minutes.    Add the broth, parsley, marjoram, thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes.    Stir in the carrots, parsnips, potatoes, yams or sweet potatoes, green beans and chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cover and cook for 15 minutes.    Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 5 to 8 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and rinse. Set aside.    In a small cup, mix the arrowroot, flour, water and a few tablespoons of the hot broth from the stew. Stirring continuously, slowly pour the arrowroot mixture into the stew. Cook for a few more minutes. Remove the stew from the heat and remove the bay leaf. Slowly stir in the sour cream. Season with a little extra pepper and salt, if desired.    Serve the stew over the noodles in individual bowls.    Preparation and cooking time: 45 minutes.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef from Canada and have been to Sweden and either one the first girl said are great, they have modern and very clean store, and while there diet is a bit different than the US one and there palate to certain food my be slightly strange to you, there is the same types of food there as in America, the one thing you going to find no matter which European country you would live in or visit, certain things like cereals, peanut butter and US staples are not available or a bit different in taste, funny enough they like Heinz Ketchup there and it is made in Germany.    One bit of caution if you like to tipple a few beverages, like here in canada there alcoholic beverages are slightly higher in alcohol an stronger in taste, you may have to settle for lighter products, if you like fish and pork product, like Denmark your in luck, but do not be afraid to try the local fare, I would recommend to have some one take you out and to places that they like to have you get the full experience, after awhile you will know them yourself and love the food there.|`|0maJCeLCaa	Ica and coop are good - but just about any supermarket would be fine ;)

VOStCrLgaa	I really like Riesling, it's a sweet light white wine. White Zinfandel is also a sweet, but heavier wine. You just have to experiment and see what you like, there are literally thousands of options.   Perhaps you would consider taking your wife wine tasting, instead. That way you could both discover what you like. If you are anywhere near some wine country, a lot of vineyards offer free or cheap tasting.

You slow cook it about two hours and it is unbelievably delicious. (and I thought I hated white chocolate)     SERVES 12   Ingredients:    2 lbs white almond bark or white chocolate  1 (12 ounce) package white chocolate chips  24 ounces dry roasted peanuts    or one jar salted   and one jar plain.    Directions:    Put all ingredients in crock pot; cover and cook on high for 1 hour. Do not stir.   Turn Crock Pot to low and stir every 15 minutes for 1 hour longer.   Drop on waxed paper and let cool.   Store candy in a tightly covered container.     Don't make it too soon before your company comes or it will be gone by the time they get there.    If you meant white chocolate too, I am sorry.    What about candy apples?  Melt caramels and dip apples or slices in it and roll them in nuts.|`|fALkYOC1aa	I call these Peanut Butter Things.

"Red telephone sitting by my desk,  practically bore your name".  (You used velvet--she chose red).    Her ending also uses the "sea".    Just one favor of you, my love   If I should die today   Take me down to where the hills   Meet the sea on a stormy day   Ride a ridge on a snow white horse   And throw my ashes away   To the wind and the sand   Where my song began     I don't know why, but your opening line, instantly made me remember this song/poem that I haven't heard in centuries.  Then you mention the "sea".  Quite a coincidence.  Well done!~

MONmVNBZaa	ALLSPICE-- also called Jamaica pepper, Kurundu, Myrtle pepper, pimento[1], or newspice, is a spice which is the dried unripe fruit of the Pimenta dioica plant, a tree native to the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico and Central America. The name "allspice" was coined by the English, who thought it combined the flavour of several aromatic spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.<br>  <br>  <br>  Season-All? Seasoned Salt is an all-purpose blend of spices designed to fit many applications. It is particularly adaptable as a blend to sprinkle on foods after cooking and for use at the table in place of salt. Season-All? Seasoned Salt is a blend of salt, spices (including chili pepper, paprika, and black pepper), maltodextrin, onion, annatto, garlic, and silicon dioxide (added to make free flowing).|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	When I think of all spice,  it reminds me of pumpkin pie.

I found this one goes over well in a croud.|`|3xNqFQMTaa	Three dips    1 large (about 250g) beetroot, stems trimmed, washed   25g (1/3 cup) fresh breadcrumbs (made from day-old bread)   60ml (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil   1 garlic clove, finely chopped   2 tbs finely chopped fresh dill   1 tbs horseradish cream   Salt & freshly ground black pepper   Carrot, orange & cumin dip   3 small (about 500g) carrots, peeled, finely chopped   2 tbs extra virgin olive oil   1 brown onion, halved, finely chopped   1 garlic clove, finely chopped   1 tsp ground cumin   60ml (1/4 cup) fresh orange juice   Salt & freshly ground black pepper   Broad bean & parmesan dip   250g frozen broad beans, thawed, skins removed   60ml (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil   1 garlic clove, finely chopped   1 tbs fresh lemon juice   Salt & freshly ground black pepper   50g parmesan, finely grated  Method    To make beetroot, horseradish & dill dip:     cook beetroot in a saucepan of salted boiling water for 1 hour or until tender. Set aside in cooking liquid for 30 minutes to cool. Drain, reserving 2 tbs of cooking liquid. Wearing rubber gloves to avoid staining your hands, peel beetroot and coarsely chop. Place the beetroot, breadcrumbs, oil, garlic, dill, horseradish and reserved cooking liquid in the jug of a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.     to make carrot, orange & cumin dip:     place carrot in a steamer over a saucepan of simmering water. Steam, covered, for 15-20 minutes or until tender. Remove from heat. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and cumin and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion softens. Place carrot, onion mixture and orange juice in the jug of a blender and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool.     To make the broad bean & parmesan dip:     cook the broad beans in a saucepan of salted boiling water for 3 minutes or until tender. Drain well. Place the broad beans, oil, garlic and lemon juice in the jug of a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl. Add parmesan and stir to combine. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool. Transfer dips to serving bowls and serve with bread.|`|AA10466359	I'd just mix the crab in, add some minced green onion tops.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Give Karla best answer.  She has it all.  It needs cream cheese to temper the acidity, more crab for flavor (Hint: use claw meat because it has a stronger flavor and is also cheaper.  I love crab cakes made out of claw meat.) and onions for pungency.  She's a winner who knows where it's at.|`|DfK4JSytaa	I will tell you what I would try if that's what I had facing me in my kitchen and nothing to replace it with and with guests about to arrive.      I would take a fine mesh strainer and put the crab meat mixture in it. Then I would run cold water over it. When it appeared as though the cocktail sauce was washed away, I'd let it drip dry for about 20 minutes. Then I would pat it dry with paper towel.    Then I would add the ingredients you think you want, hopefully not cocktail sauce. For one can of crab meat, I'd use a tablespoon of minced onion, a squeeze of lemon juice,  1/4 cup of minced celery plus one tablespoon of mayonnaise and mix.    If it is the right texture, then serve. If not add more mayonnaise as needed, being careful not to add too much. If you want a bit more spice, try a pinch of black pepper. And if you want some color, add a tablespoon or two of chopped fresh parsley,  See more recipes on http://americanmadeyes.com/recipes.html

2G8lOPN8aa	PB is a good source of protein--so that on bread is not too bad... my son ONLY likes strawberry jam on his PB&J... won't eat grape... you may see if you might like trying DIFFERENT sorts of jams or jellies with your PB... it might just be that you don't like the kind you've tried so far.  PB alone sticks to the roof of your mouth something awful. Make sure your school does not have any prohibitions on PB...many kids are allergic these days.     You should have a glass of milk with your breakfast. You are still growing and you need the calcium for your bones and the protein for muscle.      Do you like yogurt? You can pack that for lunch with a freezer-pack to keep it cold...you said you like dairy.  Strawberries and grapes travel well and are good for you.    How do you feel about eggs? Hard boiled eggs are good for breakfast and lunch... they keep pretty well unrefrigerated if they are still in their shells. They are a high quality form of protein.  You can boil up a dozen eggs at the beginning of the school week and have 3 each morning...     You could by an insulated thermos and bring hot foods like soup or pasta with sauce, or macaroni and cheese.      For recess--how about a packet of nuts (Peanuts, cashews, soynuts, sunflower seeds, walnuts?)  They will give you more energy than chips.  If you must have something "snacky" pretzels are far better for you than chips.  Have a bottle of water with your recess snack.    You should stay away from juices, really--most have too much added sugar and even the ones that are 100% natural are too caloric.  Again--you should be drinking milk with your lunch... you will be going through a huge growth spurt over the next few years and you will need that for your growing bones and muscle.    string cheese sticks--the kind that come individually wrapped are easy to toss in your bag and good for a snack...     Are there ANY veggies that you do like?  I know you said you don't care for many... but somethings my picky kids will eat are cucumbers salted with a dash of vinegar, strips of bell pepper, raw baby carrots, raw cellery sticks.  Whatever it is that you do like--try to put it into the rotation if possible.  Even a pickle is better than no veg.    I would try to add a little fruit to your breakfast--especially where you are not big on vegetables--you need the fiber and vitamins.  Bananas are easy--perhaps you can slice them and add them to top your cereal?  A half of a grapefruit is a good choice, or an orange.  Oranges are easy to toss in the lunch bag too for school.     I make fruit smoothies for my kids for breakfast often--I jsut throw some yogurt in the blender with a peeled banana and frozen berries from the freezer--you can buy a bag of mixed berries here - strawberries, blueberries, raspberries... I add a little milk just to thin it out a bit if it is too thick.    I'm glad you are looking to make some healthy changes because the diet you stated above is really unhealthy--no wonder you had tummy troubles!    * * *    Goodness...did no one else note that the boy says he doesn't like veg or meats?

AA11173395	It depends.  Some flour tortillas contain lard, so vegans, and even vegetarians, wouldn't eat them.  Corn tortillas are just corn, water and salt, so they're acceptable for vegans.<br>  <br>  There are no animal products in sea salt, so yes, vegans can eat it.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yeast is fine. Vegans can eat tortillas if they don't contain lard. Sea salt is okay too, it wasn't alive.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Everything you mentioned is fine for vegans. Vegans don't count yeast or bacteria as animals.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	O hope your friend doesn't eat salt then, hmmm!<br>  <br>  No sea salt isn't "alive", Yes, you can eat it, in moderation, as too much salt is bad. RDA is no more than 6 grammes. In one tin of soup, it is sometimes half your RDA of salt, so remember to take the time to read food and nutrition labels, and ingredients, as you need to know exactly what you are putting into your body.<br>  <br>  Yeah, flour tortillias, make sure to check ingredients, are genereally suitable for vegans. Best homecook your own.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend to go "fishing" for some salt in the sea.|`|kAfZaLwraa	Okay, your friend is kind of confused. While yes, seawater is full of organic materials (dissolved dead plants and animals, poop, etc), they aren't the primary reason for the salty water. The saltiness comes from rocks that have dissolved (and been crushed) for the last few million years. Remember that only pure water can evaporate (or freeze), so a lot of salt gets "trapped" in the ocean (Swenson, n.d.). <br>  <br>  So, yes, there probably IS some dead animal in sea salt, but probably less cumulatively than there are dead bugs/insect parts in the average chocolate bar.|`|frt7Q8YMaa	lol...is wheat an animal? lol<br>  is yeast an animal?<br>  haha theres your answer<br>  fool|`|2qbLrHBKaa	honestly if you don' t know the answer to those questions you are way too uninformed to become vegan. I'm serious, it is very difficult to be a vegan and get all the vitamins/ nutrients/ protein your body needs. You really will have to do a little research to learn how how to do it without endangering yourself. To say it takes some effort is an understatement. Salt, obviously, is a mineral. For tortillas check the ingredients on the package. Or check online to see that yes, they are both vegan. But really you will need to know what is and is not vegan when you read the label of something|`|FBGYxNSDaa	depends on:<br>  1. the ingredients of the tortillas<br>  2. the contents of the tortillas<br>  <br>  and why couldn't vegans eat sea salt?<br>  its not a vegetable, it is a rock....lol<br>  <br>  DUMB  ***<br>  <br>  salt is a rock. were rocks alive? are they now? do you look after rocks and preserve them? geez goddamn it your friend was just being a dumbass trying to catch you out. tell your friend they suck hahahahahahahahahah|`|5AbCtkWFaa	As long as the tortillas don't have animal fat, sure.<br>  <br>  Sea salt is a mineral, not alive.
1wNsBNmxaa	Well, incase anyone was still confused about the candy, the reason Lucas has discontinued some of their products is because they had lead (that's element Pb, atomic 82, the poisonous metal that can damage nervous connections (especially in young children) and cause blood and brain disorders) in them. Some of the lead was transfered from like machinery during the making of the candy and some of the candy wrappers contained lead in them which tainted the candy it covered. Anywho, you can't buy those anywhere anymore not even in Mexico, but don't worry like others before me said the Lucas candy from the ice cream man, the store, ect. is perfectly fine and safe 100% lead free.       Graveworm66~~~?|`|2nWtytwQaa	I love lucas and all that chile mexican candy. I heard they do contain lead but I don't think it is a high amount to do any damage|`|mKfQQRDuaa	Absolutely!

PBbLDI8iaa	It most likely is, the kind I had said "veg@n" on it so I knew everything was good. Since this is your first time trying it brace yourself. I think it's okay but has a strange little taste. I kinda started liking the flavor after a while and got use to it. On the other hand my mother and cousin thought it was disgusting and said it tasted like bird food (Cause the really know what that tastes like lol) But anyway it is probably fine. Hope you enjoy it!|`|9HRkwzruaa	Just call the company.  Customer service reps have everything at their fingertips and can tell you in a matter of a few minutes.  (My son and I have several food allergies, so I have to know the source of products like mono and diglycerides...the reps are always very helpful with things like that.)|`|84W8ff0paa	the only way to be absolutely certain is to email the company. They're pretty understanding about that kind of thing, and i think they get that sort of email all the time. I have written companies on several occasions and they are always very obliging.     I wouldn't trust it until you are sure, though.
hKlsJgVSaa	I bake then fry mine in a big pot. But just baking them will work just fine. I also have a honey soy sauce. It is more of a marindae consistency and very very good. Also if you can find rhubard the rhuarb b-b-q sauce is good. You could also use another fruit. Anything you have frozen would be good, or even fresh/canned.    Cut the tips off then cut at the next joint. Bake at 350 for about 20-30 minutes or until they are done. You can add them to the sauce of your choice now or fry them for about 2-3 minutes to get them real nice and crispy, drain the toss in your sauce.    Also I like to bake mine first because then I can keep some in the fridge and/or freezer and then just drop them in hot oil to warm and crisp up.    To make hot sauce. Here in the US there is a brand that is pretty common to start with. It is Franks Red Hot, doctor it up a bit and you end with with a good sauce. Here is how I doctor mine up.    1 big bottle franks  1/2 cup butter  1-2 tablespoons itailian seasoning  1-2 cloves grated garlic-optional    Heat in sauce pan. I like to cool mine to about room temp then put it in food processor until it cools a little more. This makes it combine better for reheating.    This also keeps well in an air tight conatiner in the fridge.  ---------------    Rhubarb B-B-Q---I understand not everyone has rhubarb on hand but this is good for future wings or what ever.    Ingredients:   1 heaping cup chopped fresh or frozen rhubarb  2/3 cup water  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 teaspoon canola oil  1 garlic clove, minced  3/4 cup ketchup  1/2 cup packed brown sugar  1/2 cup dark corn syrup  2 tablespoons cider vinegar  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  1 1/2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce  1/4 teaspoon salt         In a small saucepan, bring rhubarb and water to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5-6 minutes or until tender. Remove from the heat; cool slightly.     Place rhubarb in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth. Set aside.     In the same saucepan, saute onion in oil until tender. Add garlic; saute 1 minute longer. Add the remaining ingredients.     Whisk in rhubarb puree until blended. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Use as a basting sauce for grilled meats. Store in the refrigerator. Yield: 2-1/3 cups.     Or This is my Absolute Favorite for WIngs:    Honey Soy Sauce:    1/2 cup butter  1 cup honey  1 cup soy sauce  1 cup terriyaki sauce  1 tbsp seseme oil  1 tsp fresh grated ginger    Heat in a sauce pan until melted and combined. Keep unused portion in the fridge in an airtight container. Heat a little for each use.|`|yXno8yIkaa	Honey BBQ Wing Sauce    Ingredients    2 pounds Chicken wings  Sauce:  1 1/4 cups ketchup   1/3 cup white vinegar   1/4 cup molasses   1/4 cup honey   1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring   1/2 teaspoon salt   1/4 teaspoon onion powder   1/4 teaspoon chili powder     Directions    Combine the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until ingredients are well-combined and bring to a boil.   Then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 15-20 minutes.     Sprinkle wings with salt and pepper.  Place wings in crock pot and pour on sauce. Cook all day on low setting.    Or, preheat oven to 375F, and place wings in shallow casserole, pour sauce on and bake until chicken is carmelized, about 1 hour.    Wings can also be breaded, baked then tossed with sauce.      *********************************  Baked Hot Wings     4 pounds chicken wings   4 tablespoons Cajun seasoning   1 (5 ounce) bottle hot sauce (I use Frank red hot buffalo sauce)      Directions    Rinse wings in cold water and place on baking sheets. Generously sprinkle Cajun seasoning on both sides of chicken, then dash all with hot sauce (enough to cover wings, without leaking off baking sheets). Refrigerate for 3 hours.     Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).     Bake chicken in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn and bake for another 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (juices run clear).   Serve with blue cheese or ranch salad dressing, if desired.  *********************************    Baked Buffalo Wings    3/4 cup flour   5 teaspoons cayenne pepper   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder   1/2 teaspoon salt   20 chicken wings   1/2 cup melted butter   1/2 cup hot pepper sauce, such as Frank's RedHot        Directions:    Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly grease with cooking spray.   Place the flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt into a resealable plastic bag, and shake to mix. Add the chicken wings, seal, and toss until well coated with the flour mixture. Place the wings onto the prepared baking sheet, and place into the refrigerator. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.     Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).   Whisk together the melted butter and hot sauce in a small bowl. Dip the wings into the butter mixture, and place back on the baking sheet.     Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and crispy on the outside, about 45 minutes. Turn the wings over halfway during cooking so they cook evenly.|`|ixNcql9iaa	SERVES 2 -3 , 18 wings     Ingredients  18 chicken wings   1 teaspoon kosher salt   1 teaspoon garlic powder   1/2 teaspoon sugar   1/2 teaspoon paprika   1/2 teaspoon black pepper   1/4 teaspoon cayenne   cooking spray   Sauce  1 cup barbecue sauce, preferably Hickory Smoke Flavor   1/2 cup honey   2 tablespoons ketchup   2 tablespoons hot sauce   4 tablespoons butter   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder   Directions  1  Wash, dry, and season the wings with the salt, garlic, pepper, cayenne, sugar, and paprika. Preheat the oven to 375.  2  Spray a cookie sheet with a generous spray of cooking spray.  3  Place the wings in a single layer on the cookie sheet, and place in the oven.  4  Cook for 35-40 minutes, depending on the size of the wings, turning once.  5  While they are baking, make the sauce by slowly simmering the sauce ingredients over the lowest heat.  6  When the wings are done baking, carefully dip them in the sauce, and place them back in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling.  7  ENJOY!And remember to save some for everyone else!    or    BARBECUE CHICKEN WINGS      4 lb. drummettes  Garlic powder  1/2 c. soy sauce  1/2 c. honey  1/2 c. ketchup    Place drummettes in roasting pan, sprinkle with garlic powder and bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.

ssQb7bB3aa	Camomile tea is made of camomile flowers as its predominant ingredient. Other ingredients include licorice, peppermint, cinnamon, spearmint, ginseng. So, camomile tea is *not* a green tea. It is a tea made from flowers and herbs.    Traditionally, teas originate from leaves, not flowers or herbs. For example, green tea contains leaves of the Carmellia sinensis plant. It is considered green because of its low level of oxidation. Black tea also comes from leaves of the same Carmellia sinensis plant. It is considered black because it is fully oxidized when it is processed. Oolong tea is semi-oxidized tea, also from this Carmellia plant. Most other teas that you can think of are black tea.    Teas are categorised according to various methods. For example, it can be categorized according to the region where it's grown (eg Ceylon tea because it comes from Ceylon), the district where it's grown (eg Darjeeling), the form this tea is in (eg pekoe) and its oxidative processing method (eg green tea vs oolong tea vs black tea). Most teas that come from India and Sri Lanka will be black tea.|`|AA12150589	No, it's considered an herbal tea. Even though it's called tea, there are no tea leaves in it. It's really an infusion made from chamomile flowers. The flowers look like tiny daisies. They have white petals and yellow centers.  Black tea can be served with lemon or creme/millk. Sugar/sugar substitute can be added too.|`|LH8fibUqaa	i drink chai and it relaxes the **** outta me|`|G1OJNCF4aa	No it's not    Earl Grey, Lady Grey, Irish breakfast, and English breakfast  are my favorite black teas :)|`|ri4Y9Lmbaa	No, chamomile is not a tea at all but an herbal tincture or infusion.   Pu-erh is a great Tibetan Black Tea.|`|GrRXAjF7aa	Chamomile teas is considered a white/oolong tea, not a green tea.   White tea is the less processed version of the chamomile infusion, oolong tea being a little stronger.  Other herbal-not-green teas include jasmine tea, rice tea, and (ironically) peppermint tea.    Some of the more popular types of black tea are;  English breakfast - A strong tea, good for a wake up in the morning.  Irish breakfast - Similar to English breakfast, but with a peculiar flavor in the background.  Earl Grey - A rather weak tea, and a little sweet. Best for drinking without sugar.  Lady Grey - For tea parties. Even weaker than it's male counterpart.    There a millions of different types of tea, and some a really strange.  There are even red teas, from India. And Japanese Green Tea, which smells and tastes like fish.  Those I've mentioned above, however, are the safest, most common teas. Usually 100% fish-free.

p9jBnpPMaa	The argument against milk and eggs has to do with how they are treated. Cows don't need to be milked, just as nursing mothers don't need to be milked. If nursing mothers were milked, they would continue to produce large amounts of milk, just the way cows do. In nature cows would product milk until their calves were weaned. From a health standpoint is the argument that cow's milk is best suited to baby cows, not humans. It is odd to think that we drink the milk of another species. Can you imagine drinking the breast milk of a friend? Many cows are injected with hormones and antibiotics and this is then passed on through the milk supply. Most chickens are kept in inhumane conditions. Check out http://www.goveg.com/whatsWrong.asp for more info.|`|bPZlpe0taa	Well their not bad,but some people don't want to eat anything at all that comes from an animal,so eggs and milk come from animals,humans are the only ones that drink another animals milk so i guess it is a little strange if you think about it. Another reason some could not drink milk and eat eggs is the way they are produced,some places keep the hens cooped up in tiny cages and things like that to produce eggs and some places keep cows on a pump almost all the time just to get milk and keep them in small areas too,theres a few more reasons about animal cruelty with not drinking milk and stuff but i won't go into it.    http://www.peta2.com/p2vsk2_flash/|`|yPkZX6x7aa	Exactly  Vegans don't actually make a difference|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	bad.?  wahh do yu mean by bad.?    hens lay eggs.  cows produce milk.  some vegetarians dont eat it becuz it comes from an animal.  me personally i dont see what is wrong with it.|`|sJM5nO8Oaa	well i don't see why they are bad, well yes cows do need to be milked but i think that some people thinks it is bad because cow (living thing) gives milk so that is why it is bad, came situation with the hens and eggs.|`|84W8ff0paa	To be honest i don't think there is much wrong with free range eggs and milk from free range cows. We created cows via artificial selection to suit our needs so now they are defenseless and in need of constant care anyway. And yes, chickens do produce eggs of their own volition. I think it is a great waste if these resources aren't capitalized on.    Having said that, MOST dairy products are horribly cruel. I was vegan for a long time but am now more of a selective vegan. I buy vegan products but will buy dairy that i know is cruelty-free, if that makes any sense. I buy dairy that i can exercise some form of control over, but not the ice cream that i know comes from milk that comes from cows locked in a stall their entire lives.    I made the switch to vegan after i visited a chicken farm because it was the single most disturbing sight i have ever witnessed. There were enormous burn piles of chickens that had stopped producing eggs and were therefore useless and the rest of them lived in these huge long barns and never saw daylight. The average allotted space per chicken is 1 foot by 6 inches-not even enough space to turn around. It's... horrible. They live in the dark with no room to move, surrounded by their own feces. And the day they don't meet their egg quota, their necks are snapped and they're tossed on the pile. People never cease to amaze me.    I would like to point out that although horizon's milk is organic, it makes no promises of being cruelty free. I do think promised land does, though. Oh, and sometimes "cage-free" means that they all live in a huge crap-filled warehouse. Its sad that we have to be so careful about product wording, companies pretending to be compassionate just to make money.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	Having read some answers on here it is obvious that some people have no idea about farm animals or farming.  To get to your point, all cows have to be milked twice a day. For those that talk about natural conditions, there are non where cows are concerned. They are bred for milk and without that breeding they wouldn't exist. Cows as we know them can not look after themselves like other wild animals. They have become domesticated. All dairy cattle are free range. They live outdoors and graze grass. They only come in during extreme weather.  Hens on the otherhand, they are also bred for eggs, but to some extent they can live quite happily if not in captivity, but the fact that they can't fly makes them an easy target for other meat eaters such as foxes or ferral cats.A hen lays an egg about once a day, but the method of battery farming with hens can produce more eggs in a 24 hour period due to forced lighting.  There are many misconceptions and innacuracies written on here by people who only know what other people have written, and some of it is totally untrue.  I was once a dairy farmer. Every animal in my care was treated with the same respect, if not more than my fellow humans.|`|AA10264413	why do you have to be a 'vegan'?    why don't you just make food choices based on your beliefs, rather than trying to fit into some category?|`|kmpPdMPxaa	Well, I have often questioned this myself. Humans are not designed to drink milk constantly. They're the only animal who drinks milk beyond infancy. Milk is to make a small cow into a big cow. Cows do not drink their own milk past infancy, so the question is raised why do we drink it daily? The common answer will often be To make our bones strong with calcium. The only downfall to all this, is that our bodies cannot absorb this crazy amount of calcium because we don't have enough magnesium in our blood or something.     Eggs however, are different. They're really just masses of cells that didn't develop into an animal because they weren't fertilized. The reason that Vegans don't eat them is that they're a by-product of an animal, just like milk. The whole idea of Veganism is to NOT consume animals or their products.    I'm not personally a Vegan, I'm in between much like yourself as it sounds. I try to be Vegan when possible, I don't drink milk because I don't really care for it anymore, and most likely I'm becoming lactose intolerant from not drinking it for years. Eggs to me however are just a by-product that would go to waste otherwise, and when eaten in moderation aren't really a big deal. I'm not saying that I'd just eat a plate of scrabbled eggs and a glass of milk, but I think it's okay to eat stuff with milk or eggs in it here and there, But that's just my opinion.|`|3088210edce2911ef9c82a673f040f04aa	By becoming vegan you'll be cutting out the crap =] Suurre back in the day! I think it would of been ok to eat just eggs and milk. But now people are getting ridiculous, sure cows need to be milk and hens need to lay eggs. There are factory farms that force cows to go in a small area where they hook tubes and suction the milk out of them for hours against the cows will, because of that pus and blood  going into the milk. Plus the fact there isn't enough milk for their calves. Hens are shoved in small closed spaces also, no room to move and sleeping in their own feces, and I think they are shot with drugs to give more eggs people eat than baby chicks. =/|`|ffOpoLUvaa	This is just my own personal opinion and experience, so bear that in mind.    I have seen firsthand (many, many times) the horrible conditions that mainstream, commercial laying hens are kept in.  I'm sure some have already linked to examples, so I won't bother.  But I have also seen first hand (many, many times) the conditions in which dairy cows are kept.  Let me tell you, dairy cows have it good in comparison to the way beef cows are treated.      What they eat effects how the milk tastes, so farmers are sure to let the cows graze and are careful to keep a good eye on the quality of their other food.  Someone answered before me and said that dairy cows don't need to be milked and that the milk would dry up eventually.  That's absolutely true.  You couldn't stop cold turkey, it would have to be a gradual thing, milking less and less, but the milk would stop eventually.      Someone before me also said that some farms have cows hooked up to the milker all the time.  This is absolutely positively false.  As I said, farmers who own dairy cows take very good care of them.  They have to, to make sure the milk is good.  The way the system on most farms is set up, if one cow's milk is bad, all the milk has to be dumped.  If a cow isn't milked exactly when it's suppose to be, it will hurt the cow.  She'll get sores inside of her and puss, and blood.  If a cow is left hooked up top the milker for too long, the same thing happens, and there goes the milk.  Honestly most dairy farmers care alot about their livestock.  The cows have names.  They honestly care if the cow is hurting and not just because of the milk.  This is my experience    The only moral reason I can think of as to why people protest the consumption of milk is because male dairy cows aren't needed, and are disposed of.  A farmer might need one bull out of twenty heads of dairy cattle.   Like every other species, the odds of a cow having a boy or a girl are about fifty-fifty, so the other mail cows get killed.  I can see a moral dilemma in this fact.    Now about honey, silk, leather, feathers and wool.  First off, protesting the use of wool is just plain silly in my opinion.  I shave my long haired dog in the spring and summer, because she's miserable under all that fur otherwise.  People do the same thing to sheep, they just spin the wool to make clothing.  Sheep are miserable with all that wool covering them in the summer.  Would you like to be in a thick wool jacket in 90% weather?    I think not using honey is a much too.  It dosen't hurt the bees, it dosen't kill the bees, and the bees are free to roam.  Does it confuse the bees?  Yes, but only a little as each time the honey is collected their home is back in place just a few  hours later.    I have little knowledge of how silk is made.  I know it comes from silkworms, but I don't know how it's harvesting effects the silk worms.  I don't buy real silk because I have no desire for it.  If I did have a desire for it, I might do some research first.  But as of now, it doesn't' effect me.    Leather, I have a problem with.  I think of it as what it literally is, dead animal skin.  I cannot be around it without thinking of sitting on or wearing another humans bloody skin over my own.  The same goes with fur.  But that's my opinion.    I don't use or buy feathers either.  I feel it kind of defeats my purpose of being a Vegetarian.  Yes, feathers can be harvested from live birds, but how often is this the case?  Not often.    To be a Vegan means you give up all of these things.  I agree that giving up some of them for a greater purpose is noble.  But some of the things on the list?   Giving them up is just pointless in my opinion.    My goal is to become a lactovegetarian.  I am technically now an ovolactovegetarian.  I eat eggs because I lack discipline really.  Eggs are in like everything.  But morally, I want to stop.  It probably wouldn't be so bad if I only are free range eggs, but that's not the case with me.  Example:  I'm certain that the eggs dunkin donuts used in their muffin I ate this morning weren't free range.    Becoming a Vegan is a hard choice to make.  May you make the wisest decision for you.|`|AA11525569	veal is a direct product from milk. a cow has to be pregnant to give milk, and that calf is turned into veil. the milk isnt meant for humans, its meant for that calf.     chickens are the most poorly treated animals in factory farms. and free range regulations are almost nonexistent . the chicken just needs the space of about a piece of paper.. and many of the chickens in free range situations still get de-beaked without anesthetic and are treated very poorly.     if you want more information on why the production of eggs and milk is cruel, try looking at the food section earthlings.     http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZBfAeM4mYDA

In a bread machine, it's difficult to say what a wetter dough will do, but you won't hurt anything.    With a wet bread, it's important to let the loaf cool before you cut it, since there is a lot of moisture in the loaf and the bread is still baking and setting, even after you take it out of the oven or machine.    What you'll probably have is a fairly good crust, as open crumb (the inside part) and possibly an area or two with what looks like glassy bread, where the dough didn't bake properly.    Adding flour like you did is usually not a good idea, since the flour never gets wet properly, doesn't get incorporated into the dough and doesn't get a chance to develop properly.    Bottom line, you stand a 50-50 chance of making some good bread.

Copra, the dried meat of the coconut is very oily.  If you grind it, it will turn into an oily paste, not good for making coffee.  Besides, coconut meat, even when roasted or toasted will not impart the kind of aroma and flavor coffee beans do.  There are other substitutes for coffee, chicory roots, darkly roasted rice grains, some beans and seeds that you have to roast properly to bring the dark and bitter flavor close to coffee.  But these are just substitutes and unless you prefer them and like them better, these are just used by people who don't have access to the regular coffee or cannot afford it.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	While I am sure you can make a drink out of it, coffee it isn't.|`|tFoFchuEaa	Coconut is not coffee, and cannot be used as a substitute for coffee.|`|sh2dtk1xaa	No, i don't think so.|`|FR2bKa7iaa	No it is not caffeine and can not be substituted for it.

z4Xpzm3xaa	Ever get tired of the same old pizza: sausage, pepperoni and double cheese? Taco pizza is a wonderful variation.    How to Make Taco Pizza    Things Youll Need:        * 1 bag shredded lettuce      * 1 bag shredded chedder cheese      * 1 bottle taco sauce      * 1 lb hamburger      * 1 box pizza dough mix      * Flour      * Pizza pan      * Frying pan          Step1  Mix your pizza dough following directions on the box.  Step2  Fry your hamburger. Drain the grease.  Step3  Spread your pizza dough on a greased pizza pan evenly.  Step4  Spread taco sauce evenly on pizza dough.  Step5  Cover pizza with one pound of cooked hamburger.  Step6  Place your shredded lettuce over the pizza.  Step7  Sprinkle your shredded cheese on the pizza.  Step8  Place the pizza in an oven at 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown.  Step9  Cut pizza and serve.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	you couldn't have just searched it....|`|6Fa0XZtzaa	put the pizza dough on a pan, put plastic wrap on top of it and roll it with a rolling pin (This takes a while). Once you get it to the shape of the pan, put sauce and cheese on pizza dough. Put in oven until cheese is melting/bubbling or crust turns golden :]|`|69c7663f90c38e73c2328165f1dd0ae6aa	Sprinkle some corn meal on your pizza pan, then add dough and sauce.  Grate some Mozerella cheese, sprinkle on top of sauce, if you have parmesan, shake some of that on it also.  To this add anything else you like, italian sausage (cook first), peperoni, or any other cooked meat, onions sliced thin, green pepper sliced thin, mushrooms, sliced tomatoes, are all good toppings.  My favorites are onion, and green pepper.  If you have italian seasonings, you can sprinkle a little on top.  Put into a hot oven, 400 or according to dough instructions, for about 15 to 20 minutes.|`|B3NfKQHJaa	PIZZA      In a pizzeria, the oven has a very hot brick floor on which the dough is baked from the bottom while the cheese melts on top. Although your home oven may not work this way, you can make a really delicious pizza. Part of the trick is to bake the dough until nearly done before you put the tomato sauce, cheese and other ingredients on top. This recipe is designed for a home oven that will take a standard 14x17 inch aluminum cookie sheet.    Start the dough at least 3 hours before you plan to serve it so it has time to rise. Start the pre-cooked ingredients such as sausage and fried peppers at least 1 hour before serving time so that they are cool enough to handle at the time of final assembly.    DOUGH:    2 c. unbleached flour  1/2 tsp. salt  3/4 c. lukewarm water  1 pkg. dry baking yeast    Warm a large mixing bowl in the oven. Dissolve the yeast in the water, about 5 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in the bowl. Stir in the yeast and water to make a dough. Knead the dough on a floured board or counter top. Dough should be quite stiff and not sticky. Knead by folding, pressing, and turning about 30 times. Form into a ball, replace in bowl, cover, and put in a warm place to rise. This dough need rise only once.    FILLING:    1 lb. Mozzarella cheese  2 sm. cans tomato paste  2 green peppers  1 lb. hot Italian sausage  1/4 c. olive oil  1 tbsp. oregano    Oil a frying pan with a few teaspoons of olive oil. Fry the sausages, covered, for about 15 minutes, turning once, or until cooked through. While this is cooking, cut up the green peppers into 1-inch squares. When the sausages are done, remove them to a cutting board to cool; slice into disks 1/8 inch thick and set aside.    Discard the sausage fat, add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and fry the peppers, uncovered, stirring frequently until a few start to brown at the edges. Set aside to cool. While the peppers are cooking, dice or shred the Mozzarella cheese; cover; set aside. Open the cans of tomato paste.    PREPARING THE CRUST: Set oven at 550 degrees (very hot) to preheat. Punch down the dough, remove from bowl and knead for a few minutes until smooth. Flour the board heavily, pat dough out flat, roll it out thin, turning it over and flouring it occasionally.    It's easy to make a round pizza, but your oven won't be big enough. By rolling and pulling the corners, shape the dough to cover a rectangular 14x17 inch cookie sheet. To get dough onto cookie sheet, flour the dough, then quickly perform the following steps: fold it back on itself several times, lift it onto the sheet, unfold it again. The quickness is so that the dough won't stick to itself. Stretch the dough to fit the sheet. Fold and pinch up a rim around the edge.    Do not let the dough rise very long after this step. Put it in very hot oven and bake about 7 minutes, and watch for the thinnest parts just start to turn golden. Watch carefully, as it goes very fast at this stage. When golden color appears, remove sheet from oven, but leave oven at full heat.    ASSEMBLY OF THE PIZZA: The dough may have blistered and become wavy, but don't worry. With a spatula, spread the tomato paste over the whole surface but not on the rim crust. Next, scatter the oregano on the paste, then scatter Mozzarella cheese. On top of the cheese, place the sausage slices, then the fried peppers and other ingredients you may like, such as mushrooms, anchovies, olives, etc. Finally, sprinkle 2 tablespoons olive oil over the pizza.    Replace it in the oven for another 10 minutes. Then start watching it carefully. Take it out when cheese has melted and begins to sizzle a little, but before much of the cheese starts to brown.    Using a pizza cutter or heavy sharp knife, cut into 12 rectangular servings. With a salad, this pizza will make a meal for 4 or 5.
rsTB7D1zaa	If you didn't have a panic attack (which I think would be coincidental), then you probably had alcohol poisoning.    Reduced breathing is actually a very serious symptom of alcohol poisoning, typically you would be in the hospital for this.  If you think you had enough alcohol to get alcohol poisoning you are lucky.  You should have had a killer hangover (... almost literally).|`|h97v9PHjaa	It might of been a panic attack.. they can't actually harm you. it just feels liek you cant breathe.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Sounds like a panic attack. Could be brought on by not being in control.|`|AA10890128	I have a friend who has breathing difficulties when she drinks and the doctors couldn't give her definitive answer as to why but they did say "if it only happens when you drink , quit drinking"  she hasn't quit but she as cut down lots and this seems to have helped a lot.|`|VwxX8kDRaa	Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant.  Drinking too much of it can cause you to have trouble breathing.  This can be made worse if you have a cold or asthma, or if you mixed it with any medications or drugs that have the same effect.    It's also possible that you had an allergic reaction to something.|`|ubukt8WWaa	You may have had alcohol poisoning.  How much did you drink?
c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	If it is close to being ripe I have used a microwave oven. You put it in for about 30 seconds at a time letting it rest a little before doing it again. You don't want it to cook, just get warm.Careful not to leave it in too long at a time. It can explode like a potato. I have done this to make guacamole.|`|zawmsUO1aa	For even quicker ripening, add an apple or a tomato to the bag.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Keep it in a brown or plastic bag for a day.or if your disparate put it in a food processor|`|v8k5heIwaa	Put it in a paper bag, or put it in close proximity to bananas.|`|LDREvRKGaa	I have done the microwave thing too. It was suggested by somebody on YA.
joe2auNVaa	Taste it and see. If it sucks throw it out - it won't make you sick, but it might taste like vinegar.    And Darren your answer is both weird and a little creepy - why is that where your head goes? - strange!|`|MS6IzOPLaa	nope, it is definitely still good...By uncorked do you mean it was completely open? If so, it may have absorbed the odors from the fridge. Either way, is is perfectly safe to drink!  (and have a glass for me, would ya?)|`|oZ3gU7htaa	It's probably safe to drink, but won't taste as good as when fresh.

It gives a little insight into someone elses life. I bet you've been sitting there, no other alchohol in the house, thinking... I'd love to have a bit of a tipple, just a cheeky one. A little snifter of booze. Then you remember the bottle of wine in the fridge, but it's been there for a week... uncorked... what if it kills me.    I know, I'll go ask on Yahoo Answers, they'll know. Plenty of worldly wise people on there. I just need a quick answer and as soon as one person gives an answer to the affirmative... down the hatch...

I recommend drinking Svedka.  They sell it for $11, and it's a million times better than grey goose(bad vodka, good marketing).  If you want to spend a little more, Van gogh is one of the best mid range vodkas($20-29).  And if you can afford it, and find it, my alltime favorite, Ultimat Vodka.  I usually can only find this in NH liquor stores.  It's usually around $40.

z8jYprWkaa	If you use a plain flower in your cakes they will look quite pretty.

You need a leavener (makes it rise) or it will not taste good.  Non-risen cakes that were supposed to be risen usually taste like sweet chewy bricks.  Like a brownie but not good?  I can't explain really.  It just won't be good.  Best to get some baking powder.  Add a couple teaspoons.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	I suspect you'll have difficulty getting an even bake and you'll either get burnt outsides or soggy insides, neither of which will be as nice as a fairy cake.<br>  <br>  use baking powder at 1tsp to 8oz to get a rise, or, 1/4 tsp sodium bicarbonate and 3/4 tsp arrowroot if you are really desperate, but that will make it taste a bit odd.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	They will still have the same taste but will be really flat. If you have some baking powder, add a couple of teaspoons to the dry mixture. That should give you a light fluffy fairy cake. If you give up, let me have the mixture, I love eating it before it's cooked!!!!!!!!|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	add some baking soda to make it rise..<br>  <br>  if u dont want to add it, its alrite.. the taste will remain the same..<br>  <br>  but the cake will look awkward!!|`|UIXKTaghaa	The taste will remain unchanged, but they won't rise.  They'll be more like thick flabby biscuits and although the taste will be the same, the texture certainly won't be.  They'll either be tough like bullets or flabby and elastic lumps a little like play dough, and it'll be the texture that will put you off eating them!<br>  <br>  If you have some baking powder add that, 3 tsp to 8 oz of flour.|`|X4NIyjUkaa	the taste will still be the same but it will be smaller,i would require making more fairy cakes so u will eat more not less.

zawmsUO1aa	Do not use the medication in larger amounts, or use it for longer than recommended. Cough-and-cold medicines should be taken only for a short time until your symptoms clear up. I bet it states that right on the label.    Death can occur from the misuse of cough or cold medicine in very young children. Do not take a cough or cold medicine if you have used an MAO inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) within the past 14 days. Serious, life-threatening side effects can occur if you take a cough or cold medicine before the MAO inhibitor has cleared from your body. Do not take more of this medication than is recommended. An overdose of acetaminophen can cause damage to your liver. The maximum amount of acetaminophen for adults is 1 gram (1000 mg) per dose and 4 grams (4000 mg) per day. Do not use any other over-the-counter cough, cold, allergy, pain, or sleep medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too much of a certain drug. Read the label of any other medicine you take to see if it contains acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, doxylamine, or pseudoephedrine.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Yes, look at the label. It says do not use for more than 1 week unless directed by a doctor or something like that.|`|AA10102704	You can become dependent on it because it contains alcohol.
