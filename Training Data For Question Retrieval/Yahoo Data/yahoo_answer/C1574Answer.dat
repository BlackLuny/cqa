AA11225694	First buy a cheap aluminum boat. You can buy one for less than 200 dollars.   Buy two oars. They are 10 each at walmart.  Bring a 20 dollar grill and a shotgun. Shoot birds for the trip over there and back.   If strangers are unwilling to let you stay night, or bartender wants you to pay for beer, use same shotgun, producing a dead bird from your purse as proof you mean it.    I have not been there, but seen TV shows.   I just said I have not been there, how would I know what it is like?  |`|UuuTpKLwaa	Won't your friend be insulted to be known as "simple and cheap"?|`|KUVRekuZaa	I cannot advise on bike hire, as it is something I have not done. I have travelled round Ireland, and it has a good network of hostels, all pretty cheap, I have never stayed in a bad one though the ones in the big cities tend to be a bit crowded and noisy. I have not tried bed and breakfast, but I imagine it will be pretty availible. Lots of bars, in the more rural areas you will meet plenty of locals, and my experience of the Irish has been very positive, Ireland is very safe, people are friendly, in rural areas people will stop and offer you lifts even if you are not obviously hitching. General prices are a little high, but not extortionate for food and other essentials.  The offical irish tourist board site will probably be helpful in giving you more details.  Irish roads are not of the highest quality, but I have not noticed appreciably bad standards of driving (you need to got to Naples for that :-))  |`|AA11015468	Simple is easy.  Cheap is impossible in Ireland.  It is an EXPENSIVE country!  However, you would have a lot of fun, and youth hostels or backpackers hostels are plentiful, often very good and definitely the cheapest option for accommodation.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	First of all, you need to be very fit - it's hilly in places, and the roads are inclined to be a bit dangerous in places for cyclists. Wear dayglo colours.     Bear in mind also that the weather is not always that friendly to outdoor activities. We've had the worst summer in living memory.     But, if you are fit, insured, and up for it despite the weather, get yourself a good map and a list of budget accommodation for a region, and go for it! |`|rLP9wjPtaa	That is a great idea, and the best part about Ireland, IMO.  I did basically that, but with a rental car rather than bikes. Westport was the favorite while there.  |`|Xaw48PZ7aa	its a good plan. before u go, try to get in contact with someone who may let you rent a room from them for a few weeks.  u may be able to stay on a farm with a family, and "earn your keep" by doing chores.  it could be a really enlightening and enriching experience!  u would get the full flavour of irish life!
GszON1kQaa	Buying tickets for a seat on an airplane is just like shopping for anything. Most standard shops and restaurants accept credit cards, checks, debit cards, and cash, the basic form of pay. Therefore no one would object to you buying your tickets using cash at the JFK International airport.     But I do advise you to buy your tickets online and print the boarding pass 24 hour prior to departure so that you can go straight to the security point without all the hectic, busy check in process.    |`|2BEMSGPdaa	Sure you can buy a ticket for x=cash at any airport. BUT be aware that is a few points for you on the security checkup line..

I have a  family there and it seems to be very difficult for them to break in to existing businesses... But maybe that's because they don't speak Hebrew.

They work the hours that we sleep.|`|8Ev0yYwdaa	Jobs pay here $5 an hour and if you got a degree you could maybe score a good job that paid $6 an hour. To be rich in Israel you need a rich father.    The salaries in Israel are low and Israel is expensive and cars costs %250 more then in the US. Also gasoline here is %200+ more expensive, rents are very high and also food.    Make good money in Israel? having the right connections and a rich father that will get you a high paid job in his company or there is another options that a lot of Israelis do if they want to make a lot of money - its drugs, on every billion dollar drug smuggling business you hear on the news there is always atleast one Israeli that manage it all.    Life in Israel are bad, the young people are leaving to America and to London and Australia, there is no future here and young people know that they better off being illegal aliens in the USA then living here for minimum wage and being in debts all their lives.    Some Israelis got an European passport from their grandparents so they can work and live all over Europe legally, unfourtunely I'm not one of those people - so I'll immigrate abroad illegally.      Do yourself a favor, if you are thinking of moving to Israel then DONT do it, it will be a terrible mistake, unless you are from Nigeria, if you are from Nigeria then Israel will be a minor improvement.|`|0fW76gB8aa	Same as in every other country.

No meu tempo ( fui umas 5 vezes ) havia uma cachacinha fraquinha, fraquinha em barracas na areia do farol de itapuan ( t?o fraquinha que bebi todas e perdi o onibus ( naquele tempo avi?o era elitizado e por isso ia de onibus namorando daqui at l: namorei japonesa, mineira e at uma muda eu namorei na viagem, beijei muito ! ).  O mercado modelo, tinha cada bar p sujo.  Andar a p pelo centro de salvador : elevador lacerda, pra?a onde ficava o antigo hotel ilheus, bairro de plvora, baixa do sapateiro.  Nadar em amaralina.  Ir a salvador e n?o ir a ilha de itaparica  perder boa parte: arrumei um casal baiano que ficava tomando conta enquanto eu tomava banho pelado, o casal dizia que para o turista tudo era permitido, mas se pegassem um baiano n a PM metia borrachada.  Em itaparica, andei tomando cerveja e comendo peixe em um lugar chamado "caixa prego".  Tomei cerveja com um cara que me falava que encontrou um baiano t?o pregui?oso que quando ele entrou no seu estabelecimento comercial, ele estava deitado e deitado ficou: escolha a ! e na hora que o cliente foi pagar, o baiano falou: fa?a o tr?co a ! ( deve ser folclore ).  Esse sujeito me falava que o verdadeiro carioca era o baiano que n?o deu certo, que o verdadeiro pregui?oso era o baiano, pelo relatado acima.  Em outra ocasi?o eu ia atrs de uma mulher em um ponto remoto de itaparica e queriam me cobrar uma fortuna ( a maioria da ilha era de turista estrangeiro e o sujeito foi intransigente ), desiti momentaneamente e fui beber e come com uma baiana que conheci na hora, comemos 2 peixes e bebemos 4 cervejas e paguei as nossas passagens em busca da outra mulher que eu queria. Saiu mais barato os peixes, as cervejas e as nossas 2 passagens que o que me queriam cobrar para me levarem ao destino, claro que fiquei com a boca fechada enquanto ela negociava os pre?os.  Talvez valha a pena ir ao teatro Castro alves.  Para o pessoal mais endinherado talvez valha o "mediterran" seja uma boa pedida, coisa que nunca fiz.  Outra pedida , mas s vale para quem gosta de sossego, cidades pequenas como Brumado ( fica muito longe de salvador), livramento ( baiana, n?o  RS ), vitria da conquista.

AA10523012	Hallo,    erstmal gibt es nur eine Moeglichkeit hier zu arbeiten: man braucht einen Sponor. Ohne den laeuft garnichts.    1. Frage: Ich wuerde empfehlen: UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman    2. Frage: was man machen kann, haengt davon ab, was man fuer eine Qualifizierung hat. Machen kann man alles, aber ob man das moechte?    3. Frage: Man schaut im internet nach recruitment agencies und deren Angebote (Openings). Falls dann etwas entsprechendes dabei sein sollte, schickt man seine Bewerbung los.  Falls erwuenscht, schicke ich gerne ein paar adressen per mail.    "3 Monate bis evtl. 1 Jahr" koennte evtl. schwer zu bewerkstelligen sein. Hier ist es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben, dass der Arbeitgeber (Sponsor) alle Kosten bzgl. Immigration zu tragen hat. Dies hat zur Folge, dass meistens (Ausnahmen gibt es nauerlich immer) Vertraege auf 1 bis 2 Jahre geschlossen werden.    Um weitere Infos zu geben, mueste man mehr Details zum gewuenschten Job wissen.      Gehaelter sind hier steuerfrei, arabisch ist keine Voraussetzung, aber englisch.    Bei Interesse bin ich gerne bereit per email auszuhelfen.    @zu den weiteren Antworten. Selten so etwas unqualifiziertes gelesen. Spricht da etwas der pure Neid?|`|6336b9c408931b5cd90c754980633db8aa	Vor ca. 26 Jahren hatte ich ein Angebot, beruflich in die VAE zu ziehen. Allerdings war ich wohl zu feige.

Inzwischen lebt er mit Frau und Kind dort und die Familie hat keinerlei Ambitionen, au?er auf Urlaub mal wieder nach Europa zu kommen. Wenn Du in google nach dubai recruitment agencies oder dubai employment agencies suchst, solltest Du ein paar Treffer kriegen. Ansonsten haben alle m?glichen gr??eren Unternehmen dort einen Standort.    Saudi soll nicht so toll sein, dem Vernehmen nach leben die Ausl?nder in irgendwelchen Ghettos.

6DSgr6fraa	Definitely Samoa!  Its perfect!!!!  Its got amazing snorkling and good surfing!!  You really could go anywhere in the pacific! I have been to heaps and I have to say Samoa was my favorite!!  Its not as touristy as somewhere like Raratonga of Fiji  It has some of the nicest people in the world!  Plus it has plenty of things to do! Such as the waterfalls slides!!!! They are natural waterfalls in a beautiful jungle which are very smooth so you just slide down them! And the best bit? we spent nearly a whole day there and didn't see one other person =]     Also you can stay the night in traditional Fales! they are samoan huts with no walls which are on the golden beach side! They are beautiful! You can go to sleep to the sound of gentle waves!  plus they are rreeeaallly cheap!! But if you prefer a resort then aggie greys or the coconut beach resort!! Both really good and clean!    Its sooooo relaxing!!!!!

wihrLsUKaa	My son and my family have always loved going to Gatlinburg, TN and getting a cabin:  yes it is well worth the money.  I generally rent from www.cabinfever.com.  The park is there and it is beautiful, not to mention the town of Gatlinburg itself. Pigeon Forge is a bit more touristy, but nice all the same.   Destin, Florida is our other favorite place to visit.  The charm of the "old fishing village", watching the dolphins swim right outside of your room, taking the dolphin cruise, and they take pics with the children steering the boat.  Both are a blast and we do both every year.  Generally Gatlinburg in the fall/winter and Destin in the Spring/summer.

A dica de hotel que te dou :  Se for acompanhado de at 3 pessoas o formule I de Curitiba hospeda 3 pessoas no mesmo apto por volta de 70 reais a diaria para tres pessoas.  Ele esta  aproximadamente duas quadras da rodoviria. Se visualiza o edificio e a placa de identifica??o al mesmo do terminal.  Fica um pouco distante do centro.  longe para ir  pe.  A outra op??o  o Hotel escola Centro Europeu, que est localizado no incio da rua 15 de novembro, que  uma das rua mais conhecidas de Curitiba. Est bem no centro.

FpT7x2VVaa	not quite --- correct would be:    Hend'l  or    Henderl    high German: Henne (female), Hahn (male) or the 'cute' name Hnchen -- usually used when the thing is fried or baked and on your plate.   In Austria - "Backhenderl" or "Bachhendl" or if fried, "Brathendl"    Das "Huhn" refers really to the whole family of "chicken" with no gender attached.    additional comment:   "Kurchen" really spells "Kcken" in German (which is also the Austrian language) and means translated "chick" - also a small, young animal.    a real Austrian dialect word for this would be " Tuisal"|`|94b8KImYaa	Haenderl ?     Das Huhn is what we could call High German.   Heanderl is the same, but in dialect - so you would be both right.   For sure there are other words they use in Austria as well for Chicken.

0Ricbs1faa	Hi there!  I would recommend you eat at one of the restaurants around the Seven Seas Lagoon in one of the resorts, since you won't be in the parks that day.  Let me warn you, you won't be the only ones with this idea so make sure you try to get reservations ASAP, if there are even any availible.  If you want to eat at a 5 Star restaurant (very expensive) then try to get into Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. It might be very difficult to get a reservation there, though.  Also try Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary Resort and maybe the Aloha dinner show at the Polynesian if you want to try something different.  There are multiple restaurants at each of the resorts on property, but those ones will likely have a view of the lake and possibly Cinderella's castle.  Like I said, reservations are probably going to be hard to get, but February isn't too peak of a season so you might be ok.  Just call 407-WDW-DINE (I am fairly sure this is the number) to ask for reservations.  You could try one of the other resorts not along Seven Seven Seas Lagoon.  The Boardwalk resort is very romantic as well, maybe you could try finding a restaurant there.  The Swan and Dolphin resorts, though not technically owned by Disney, are on property and have a romantic feel as well.  Downtown Disney is another option, and easy to find.  There's a Wolfgang Puck's and a Cuban restaurant there.  There's also a House of Blues and Planet Hollywood.  The Cast Member on the phone should be able to help even further.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	i recommend "california grill" in the contemporary resort.   you'd better call now for reservations as it will be extremely crowded on valintines day.   call 1-407-WDW-DINE to reserve a time.    if you can't get in there try "victoria and albert's" in the grand floridian resort. (reservations are required) and this restuarant doesn't allow kids under 10.

Extra Bonus:  In front of Notre Dame is "Point Zero" (a round bronze plaque in the pavement) where all distance miles in France are measured from Paris.  People place their toe on it, and revolve around it 360 degrees.  It is a tradition to do this.

Except for a city in Texas.    The actual word "Palestine" came from the Romans, not the Arabs, and there has never been an independent country or state of Palestine, nor a Palestinian rule.  Yet we are led to believe that there are Palestinians and then there are Arabs.      In August 11, 1919 in a memorandum to Lord Curzon, Lord Balfour stated that "whatever be the future of Palestine, it is not now an 'independent nation,' nor is it yet on the way to becoming one." Professor of history Reverend James Parkes wrote in Whose Land that "before 1914, the mass of the population [in Palestine] had no real feeling of belonging to any wider unit than their village, clan or possibly confederation of clans." He stressed the point that "up to that time it is not possible to speak of the existence of any general sentiment of nationality."     There is no language known as Palestinian.  There is no distinct Palestinian culture.  There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians.  Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc.  Keep in mind that the Arabs control 99.9 percent of the Middle East lands.  Israel represents one-tenth of 1 percent of the landmass.      As long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state in the Middle East, the conflict will remain unresolved.  Israel must completely and totally defeat the Arabs, so that a peace treaty can be signed and enforced.        .|`|BTSQBk6Taa	People are not "Born in Palestine" just as people are not born in the USSR.  Palestine was a region for hundreds of years.  There never was a country called Palestine.

So... someone who is born in Jordan is a Jordanian and someone who is born in Israel is an Israeli.|`|i7oHTo9haa	There is no such thing as Palestine.  They just want Israel, piece by piece and don't want peace. Israel is fighting for her freedom.    They were bred by Syria to overthrow Jordan, Lebanon and Israel.  All those countries got their land when the modern states were formed, but wanted to leave Israel out in cold.  They are Syrian orphans abandoned on Israel's doorstep.    The statehood on all these countries (ones that waged war) is as follows:  Jordan 25 May 1946, Israel 14, May 1948, Syria 17 April 1946, Lebanon 22 November 1943, Egypt 18 February 1922, Iraq 3 October 1932, North Yemen 1918, South Yemen 1968    You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967.  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."    "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it."- Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937 -  "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."  - Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946 -  "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria."- Representative of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956   Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated: "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."

After 60 years no doubt some of these people actually think there is such a thing as a Palestine people, but that doesn't mean Israel needs to secede Judah tribal land to them.  West Bank is an English name, the real name is Judea.  The Palestinians are welcome to have Gaza but instead of making their skyscraper in the sky on prime beach front real estate on the Med Sea they created this strange underground society that builds thousands of tunnels in their desire to wage war.  They should have had both the skyscraper and a train system to/from Judea by now, but it's evident what their real plans are.  They are borne from Syrian hatred and a passport or citizenship isn't going to change that fact. They will need to disarm and cut the apron strings from both Iran and Syria if they want to be a distinct place called Palestine.

They are known as Arab Israelis, or the "Arabs of 48" because they were the Palestinians who chose to remain in their homes during the war and not flee to make the Egyptian, Jordanian, Lebanese, Iraqi, Syrian, and Saudi coordinated attack on Israel easier. There is no difference between an Arab Israeli and an Israeli Jew in terms of civil liberties or personal freedoms, except that an Arab Israeli who does not serve in the military for 2-3 years to protect Israel like all the Jews, Druze, and Bedouins must do may find difficulty applying for benefits, jobs, or university places that require the fulfillment of this service. It's no different in any part of the world that still recruits young people into the army mandatorily.    There is also no difference between an Arab Israeli and a Palestinian in terms of political views or hatred of Israel. On the whole, Arab Israeli Christians have fewer problems, and a minority of secular Muslims are integrated.    A Palestinian born in the disputed territories has an Israeli-issued ID card but is not an Israeli citizen. He is eligible to apply for citizenship, but this is often rejected because, let's face it, he wants those yahudi sharmutas wiped off the map.    A Palestinian born in a refugee camp in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, or anywhere in the Arab world, typically remains stateless, because Arab countries are reluctant to take in their own refugees the way Israel absorbed 1 million Mizrahi Jewish refugees between the 1940s and the 1970s who were terrorized and imprisoned and tortured and bombed and robbed of everything they had. The Arabs argue that by accepting Palestinian refugees as citizens and giving them a humane standard of living, they would be eroding their Palestinian character, although I have discussed in one of my previous posts here http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind... that several Arab and Palestinian figures have admitted that the idea of Palestine has no historical existence and is used as a pretext to fight the Zionists.    Some very old Palestinian Christian families emigrated to the Americas in the 1800s, where they have done extremely well for themselves, even in destitute countries like Honduras and Brazil.    There are also millions of recent Palestinian Muslim immigrants living in America, Canada, Europe, etc, where they take delight in abusing Western hospitality and law and terrorize the local Jews. Palestinian protesters in Florida told the Jews to go back to their ovens - in Denmark, a Palestinian shot two Israeli workers, and schools with Arab children are refusing to accept Jewish students because of the danger - in Canada, a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu was completely disrupted by Palestinians throwing chairs and breaking windows - and in Sweden just about a week ago, a pro-Israel rally was thwarted by a crowd of Palestinians who attacked with eggs, bottles, and teargas grenades, screaming "Hitler! Hitler! Hitler!"|`|2MP9nYLdaa	no they are not Israel is Jewish and belongs to God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob.|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	no.  that is way there is a struggle there|`|989AaRM7aa	sorry no it is hard for Palestine citizens to get a  passport if they are living in there homeland or not in 1948 when the state of Israel created many was forced out by the Zionist to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt many are living under a dictatorship that can easy be exported back to Palestine with the threat of death the Zionist might call them Hamas, Hizbullah, Islam Jihad, Fatah al Islam fighter with the training from Iran
hI1V3SB5aa	Foreigners are usually charged US$60 for the Abela sleeper train, and as such it doesn't work out much cheaper than the cheapest tickets available on EgyptAir. I've used both and though the train is nice (air con cabins, fresh linen, food to your door etc) but I prefer flying simply because the wake up call on the train is too early for my taste. I prefer to take the late night red-eye flight, arriving around 1am, and get a late night sleep and have a lie-in next morning :-)    Make sure you book lfights in advance as soon as you arrive in Egypt, in order to get the cheap tickets though, as prices to book outside Egypt are more expensive, and there is only a limited number of cheap tickets, which cost LE600 - LE700 each, one way. The train takes around 9 hours overnight, the plane takes 1 1/4 hrs.     There is also a bus service from Cairo to Luxor, but the train is a lot better. If you want to go overland by day, take a 2nd class AC day train (8 1/2 to 9 hrs) that is very good value, LE50 to LE60. You don't get a bed but the scenery is nice (often beautiful) and the 2nd class AC seating is very very roomy and comfortable (and reclines, if you want to sleep). The crew bring around hot drinks regularly but (and this is my mantra for anyone in Egypt) bring your own snacks as the on board selection is limited on most services.     Interestingly, if you are travelling as a family, you will find the seats (arranged business class airline style) can be swivelled so you can face one another if you wish.The silver pedal on the floor mounting of the chairs unlocks it, then just swing them by hand. Bring an MP3 player and proper headphones and/or earplugs, as Egyptians like to pass the time on long train journeys by having inane, loud mobile phone or person to person conversations, or better still listening to their own MP3 collection on loudspeaker.|`|0pM85b5Baa	Available by bus  By Normal train  By Sleeping train  By flight    The best is sleeping train or flight if you don't mind to pay the cost. The ticket varies from time to time. It can be sometimes 700 EGP and later 1100 EGP. There are many classes with different prices. If you can book so early, you can get the cheapest class.     Sleeping train everyday from Giza station to Luxor and Aswan. Price per person in DBL cabin per way for foreigners is 60 $ and for SGL 80 $. The price includes dinner and breakfast. There are 2 trains. 1st 8:00 PM and 2nd 8:30 PM. The class of the sleeping train is like a 4 star hotel or 3 stars deluxe.     Good luck and welcome|`|hhhk499qaa	bus-that's a nice idea!  train-forget it, it may not be safe  taxi-bus is better  plane-that is the best, but you may find it as expansive                  the best way to go is by a super jet                          Good luck! and have fun!|`|825a07e94b3061119d7b183db44bbad4aa	On my visit last month I took the Sleeping Train " where there are sleeping cabinets and a dinner meal is provided" , it costs LE. 150.00 one way and takes 12 - 14 hours maximum.|`|b7132e649b5514cba275bcc7b9d9c640aa	Definitely by plane.

The culture in the middle east now is not REALLY middle eastern culture. A large majority was adopted from Greeks. Before Islam began, most books in Arabic were translated and read in Greek. Greek was in a someways a first language to many people. Turkish and Greek culture is similar in this same respect. This is why the food in the middle east is so similar to Greek and Turkish food. The music is similar (more so less to Greek). In all honesty, there is no middle eastern culture without European culture and there is no European culture without middle eastern culture. They are both intertwined to an extreme extent. Then the question lies where do the Greeks come form? Historians point back to the middle east (maybe there are some new revelations I do not know). Most of middle eastern culture is still centered on the areas of Iraq (Babylonia) and Iran (Persia).|`|I9UQ6ZPxaa	im interested in my own lebanese culture and i am also fascinated by egyptian culture and the bengali culture...

0yisMBdGaa	I would suggest to you perhaps somewhere in Catalonia!    It's located right by the Mediterranean sea and its a perfect location!!  I would suggest to perhaps not Barcelona itself, but the town of La Pineda, which is very close to Salou would be perfect. Within that little town itself, there are many shops, bars and restaurants, also within 5 minutes there is the beach, which has lovely sandy beaches, and warm, clear water and also there is the Aquopolis waterpark which your kids would love. Very safe and family orientated place!    Then about 1 hour away from there, you have Barcelona, which im sure you know all about, and also there is Port Aventura which has the Universal Studios theme park and Costa Caribe water park. So life in terms of your children having things to do as they grow up is going to be far from boring! The only downside is, it is in Catalonia, and they have their own language called Catalan so you would probably have to learn that as well as Spanish. You would get along just fine speaking only Spanish, however if you plan to live there, it would go a long way for you to learn Catalan also!!    If you wanted something different however, i would perhaps consider one of the Canary Islands, where moving and setting up family life there is becoming more and more popular these days!    Good luck!!|`|uQeKe7MBaa	I live on the costa blanca and it's great.20 mins to the beach,lots of great places for walking,cycling etc and my two young kids just love it.You really need to come over for a few months and travel about and decide where you would enjoy living.I think it's much nicer to live in a spanish village than in a resort full of moaning expats.it just takes a bit longer to settle in but your kids will pick up the language with ease and so will you if yo're not surrounded by english speaking folk all the time.|`|4EuO7j3Taa	alicante is a real nice place its down the south of spain its very near benidorm and terra mittica theme park also near a place called gaudalest which is the second most visited attraction in spain.  the weather is much nicer here than a lot of spain is|`|iiZu2CZDaa	Large and lively cities, maybe not as big as Madrid or Barna, but Valencia, Seville, Saragossa, Murcia... they're big but made-to-measure as well and they're not almost dead when it's not holiday season.

0pM85b5Baa	Mount Sinai is in the middle of South Sinai, you should spend 1 or 2 nights on your way to make it right. There is a certain time to go to the top of the mountain and visit the Monastery if you like. It will be quite cold for a 5 year old kid now. It's the coldest and highest spot in Egypt.   Still it's possible to make it and enjoy your time with the kid, but you need a professional tour.    I can help you but you should know you'll provide many details and should be ready with a good budget if you are going in a private tour. It will cost you much to take a private transportation and wont be suitable to use public transportation with young kid with you. You have also other choice which is flights, but still you need accommodation. I recommend you should spend few days in South Sinai and enjoy it during your stay you'll make the visit to the mount Sinai with a good price. You may not have the chance again to visit this great nature and cities of south Sinai, so don't miss it.     Dahab is the nearest and good city to stay in before the visit or just go directly to St. Catherine and spend the night there. You'll fnd many camps and small hotels beside the mountain. Please take your time to enjoy your visit, no need to hurry.

kgBPU4xxaa	You'll love Rome; it's a great tourist destination with a lot to see and do.    It depends a lot on your interests, but it's hard to go wrong on weekend trips anywhere since there are so many interesting things to see and do. From Spain, Paris would be one obvious choice. I go to Amsterdam fairly often from northern Italy because there are good flights and it's very easy to get around there. There's usually something interesting going on in the Netherlands and the train system gives you pretty easy access to most of the country. Keukenhof opens in mid March - the tulips will be spectacular in late April. Munich is a great city and a good base to see places like Neuschwanstein, Nurnberg, and other places. Prague is a great destination. Certainly there are a lot of opportunities within Spain too.     You might find these useful sites for planning travel; they're good for finding budget airlines: http://www.whichbudget.com/en/ and https://www.skyscanner.net/ . Personally, I like to use the night trains when possible. You can sleep in a berth through the night and arrive early at your destination. It maximizes sightseeing time since you don't have to deal with getting to/from airports, waiting for baggage, getting through security to a gate early, etc.

There IS protocol though. 30 days or more before the dog comes to the USA, he needs a rabies vaccination, make sure to keep the paperwork on it with you in the airport at all times. You will be checked at customs. This certificate should be in English or be accompanied by a translation. It should identify the animal, the dates of vaccination and expiration, and be signed by a licensed veterinarian. If no expiration date is specified, the certificate is acceptable if the date of vaccination is no more than 12 months before the date of arrival.     If a vaccination has not been performed, or if the certificate is not valid, the animal may be admitted if it is confined immediately upon arrival at a place of the owner's choosing. The dog must be vaccinated within four days after arrival at the final destination, but no more than 10 days after arrival at the port of entry. The animal must remain in confinement for at least 30 days after being vaccinated.    If the vaccination was performed less than 30 days before arrival, the animal may be admitted but must be confined at a place of the owner's choosing until at least 30 days have passed since the vaccination.     Young puppies must be confined at a place of the owner's choosing until they are three months old, then they must be vaccinated. They must remain in confinement for 30 days.       Hawaii and Guam are known to have more restrictions.
d89qNyb6aa	Before snow or ice the gritters come out.  The gritters are lorries with Salt in them.The lorry sprinkles the salt onto the roads to stop the ice or snow from sticking and causing the roads to be dangerous.  http://www.marketrasenmail.co.uk/getedim...|`|xFTAeLtcaa	come on get a grit    its when a lorry goes around putting grit on the roads to help melt the ice and stop accidents,,,though haven't seen any around my area|`|9uyY6szJaa	This question is the answer why there is a traffic chaos in London now. Many people doesn't even know what is road gritting :)    Salting the roads or putting anti-slip dust on it to avoind accidents.|`|AA11503426	When it's cold you'll find big lorries driving around the main roads in your area. They usually do this very early in the morning or very late at night.They contain a mixture of grit and some salt. The grit/salt mixture is spread all over the surface of the road by the lorry.    The salt melts any ice which is on the road (salt melts ice, try it with an ice cube at home). The grit provides a rough surface so cars have something for their tyres to grip onto and stop them sliding about.    Gritting is used on main roads when it is likely to be icy, and therefore cuts down the amounts of accidents due to cars sliding into each other/off the road. The smaller roads often do not get gritted, so you must be extra careful when driving on these (in fact be careful everywhere when it is icy or snowing!).|`|AA11362086	This is where lorries holding massive quantities of Salt travel up and down the highways spreading the salt to stopping the roads from freezing over.

l9c2Uw5baa	I would recommend get your degree - don't go back to high school unless you need to complete certain courses.  Try and go to college then university - try that route.    I would say both Centennial and George Brown have great programs, they are similar in what they offer.  It's really depending on where you want to travel.    Good luck!
rVUvopaLaa	there are certain issues you need to consider also apart from getting a qualification in Canada;    i know this might appear personal but you need to think of your options;    if you get to study in canada for architectural technology, it MIGHT be a full time course.  meaning you'll be a full time student of course.  don't know if there's a part time course for this.  which means you need to consider how will you support yourself financially?  what i mean is it's good thing if you can work and at the same time study like night courses or after hours.      now if you have the qualifications from canada actually it doesn't guarantee of an employment.  the reality is you'll be competing from other applicants with canadian qualifications also and perhaps with canadian experience.    your other option is get an online course for architecture technology or a home study course so that you can work full time as well.    personally it doesn't matter what school you'll be goin.  because you need to consider also the location of your house later on, workplace (if ever), or maybe the public transport accessibility.      while the college options you said they are not university and commonwealth government like canada the university qualifications is more of high value than from a college institution (in a way).      finally, you need to get a local experience before you can actually get a job related to your qualifications from overseas.  this is the reality that you need face.        good luck!|`|7BAjFHqraa	If you can get an education in Toronto, great! But if you plan to practice here locally, you'll have to read up on local codes and laws.    If you are choosing between UP and UST, I'm biased and would choose UP. UP College of Architecture offers a more scientific approach to architecture coupled with an open approach to problem solving. Mind you, its cheaper studying here in Manila than abroad.    Or, just finish one architecture degree in any country and take the certification exam in the country you want to practice in.    Good luck!

With the economic climate, take care who you book flights with. KLM for example have cancelled all flights to Australia to cut cost. Not sure where that would leave you if you had brought flights with them 12 months in advance.... you should be allright with big major airlines I would have thought.    If you book through and agents you'd probably be coved for airlines going bust or cancelling.    If booking online ensure you read the small print and cancellation polcies so you don't get left stranded if your airline goes under.

Basically it is a giant snowball of corporate research that shows good product development, market research and merchandising.    Kawaii style dominated Japanese popular culture in the 1980's. Kawaii or 'cute' essentially means childlike; it celebrates sweet, adorable, innocent, pure, simple, genuine, gentle, vulnerable, weak, and inexperienced (1) social behaviour and physical appearances. It has been well described as a style which is 'infantile and delicate at the same time as being pretty.' (Yamane, 1990, my translation) Cute style saturated the multi-media and consumer goods and services whilst they were expanding rapidly between 1970 and 1990 and reached a peak of saccharine intensity in the early 1980s.     Cute people and cute accessories were extremely popular. So much so that original cute fashion became a basic style or aesthetic in to which many other more specific and transient fashions such as preppy, punk, skater, folk, black and French were mixed. Cute fashion gradually evolved from the serious, infantile, pink, romanticism of the early 1980s to a more humorous, kitsch, androgynous style which lingered on into the early 1990s.

NyJeK6NSaa	Its difficult to calculate an average cost of living, as it depends on an individuals circumstances and lifestyle.    The approximate minimum monthly major expenses for an average person or family in an average town or suburb are shown in the table below (the figures in brackets refer to the notes below). When calculating your cost of living, deduct the appropriate percentage for income tax and other deductions from your gross salary.

Rental or mortgage on a modern apartment or semi-detached house in an average small town or outer city suburb. The cost for a single person is for a bedsitter or sharing accommodation. Other costs are for a two (couple) and three-bedroom property (family). They dont include subsidised housing.  2. Includes electricity, gas, telephone and water, plus heating bills.  3. Includes all entertainment, holiday and sports expenses, plus newspapers and magazines (which could of course be much higher than the figure given).  4. Includes running costs for an average family car, plus petrol, road tax, servicing and third party insurance, but not depreciation or credit costs.  5. Includes all voluntary insurance, except for comprehensive car insurance and expensive private health insurance.|`|9d3XJecAaa	I have no idea... however to raise one child, on average costs 250k (sterling pounds) and thats not including waterbills ang gas etc.|`|p824592Baa	$250 and up i would say it really depends on the type of place you are after, its cheaper to live with other people eg. flat, since you all would share the cost of living, it's hard to say though i haven't lived in Melbourne for like a year so I'm not sure if it has changed or not

I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.    While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts. Here is the official website >>> http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/    Listed below are some excellent restaurants you should definitely try out.

I don't even do half of my shopping in New York; I do it in either Paramus, New Jersey or online. However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.    As far as attractions, there are a lot of things you should go to see. You should definitely try to go see the Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. The website Im giving you is for directions to the ferry station, where you can go see Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. Unfortunately, the interior of the Statue Of Liberty is closed, but the wonderful statue is beautiful. The website is here >>>> http://www.ny.com/transportation/ellis.h...

Also, for transportation, there are maps in subway cars and on subway trains, and there are also maps in buses. The maps at bus stops are usually just for the bus route.    I hope this guide has helped you, and I hope you enjoy the many wonders you will find in New York City!|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	ask the hotel recptionist to give you leaflets and ideas of what to do over there.|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	Woooop.  I just went to NY.    You should go to Madison Square Garden, Empire State, Grand Central Station, Chrysler, Rockefeller Centre, Central Park, Ground Zero, Bryant Park, Battery Park, Woolworth Tower, Statue Of Liberty and Ellis Island, Times Square, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Wall Street, Trinity Church, Broadway,, etc.    In midtown Manhattan there are loads of galleries and art/photography museums, there is also a Police Department museum which is good.    =D    Xx
9e250a05d954f6c73a9b8b369c78dd43aa	First "ganis" is not correct. It is "Kaneis" and "gala" is "kala" "Da" is ta...It seems like american Greeks that forgot their language or never actually learned it....But because I can figure out what is written here you go in Greek and English.       ? ?,  ?       ??    ?. ?  ?

Yeah right, you forgot me, How are you doing "down" there , good?( Referring down at Greece or somewhere south")  The same as you know, and you?

How do I tell the cat milk?? (what?)  "the same, how about you????"  "yes milk or I the same you told me...(not a word) school now everybody laughs...."  A lot of this is really mispelled.|`|yEe3WkFCaa	Here it is...    "What are you doing dolls, you wrote to us, huh?  Hi, George...Yes, you wrote to me."  I have no idea what the other sentence says.    "The same, as you know.  You?"    I think you misspelled some of the words because I don't understand some of them.|`|7I6SHj7raa	Hey "dolls" (can't think of another translation), you've forgotten us/you wrote to us ("mas grapsate" literally means "you wrote to us" but it is also a slang expression which can mean "you've forgotten us/you've stopped paying attention to us").     Hello Giorgos, how are you? Yes, you too wrote to us/forgot us. How are you doing over there, are you OK?    Yes, I'm the same as always. How about you?     I'm fine, I'm working now. I've finished school now, everything's OK.    Some words are not written correcly, this is what I understand.

eusUC9I4aa	A pretty rigid one; but that's what makes the system effective. There's first preschool (optional), nursery, kindergarten (2 years), primary school (6 years), then secondary school (4 or 5 years).    From sec school you can choose either junior college (2 years), Millenia Institute (special course; 3 years), polytechnic (no. of years varies) or an ITE.    We have a pretty good but stressful education system, but it's bearable for most and I like it. :)|`|yFo1GR3gaa	Nursery  Kindergarden  Primary  Secondary(O'Levels)  Tertiary[JC or Polytechnic(A'levels or Diploma)]  University(Degree)    I think that's what your asking, yes, we have schools that provide this.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	Singapore style and mixed style.

So3R4t66aa	It is the passenger's personal responsibility to ensure that they have valid documentation which meets the requirements of Ryanair, immigration and other governmental authorities at every destination.    Any fines, penalties, payments or expenditures incurred as a result of breach of this requirement shall be paid by or charged to you. In order to ensure compliance Ryanair recommends that you carry your valid passport (and visa if applicable) on all journeys.     Passports for travel outside the European Economic Area must have six months validity beyond the date of entry.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	It depends where you are going and you fail to state that.    If you are visiting a country that requires a visa or a visa waiver then they will expect you to have that much time left on your passport.    If for example you visit a country with a 6 month visa waiver period then you will need that 6 months left on your passport or obviously you could be in the country after it runs out.    If you travel to a country where you don't require such things and will be back before your passport runs out then you are fine.    It isn't about just traveling on your passport, it's about where you are going and for how long.|`|4VY7u6tNaa	The name of this month is February. You are travelling this month, February, and your passport is ok until March, being the month after February, 4 weeks after February. 4 weeks AFTER you have travelled.

3fHZOobiaa	We have to do a clarification... Are you looking for archeological sites dated back to the Roman age or also to the Greek one ? In fact, in Italy and especially in Southern-Italy there are many Greek sites, seeing that it belonged to Greece in the past... So at the moment I'll mention both the Roman and the Greek monuments...    Starting from Rome, you can see:    Colosseum ( the most famous and bigger anphteatre of the Roman Empire)  http://www.clandestinoweb.com/images/sto...    Roman Forum ( Roman)  http://www.romeguide.it/MONUM/ARCHEOL/fo...    The Pantheon (Roman) , the temple devoted to all the Roman Gods  http://www.traveladventures.org/continen...    Circus Massimo (Roman)  http://sandbox.dbc.wroc.pl/~lestat/Socie...    In other places of Italy there are:    The old town of Pompei (Roman)  http://www.villarenatour.com/assets/imag...    and Ercolano (Roman)  http://www.itinerarinapoli.it/it/ercolan...    The Arena of Verona (Roman)  http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/p...    The Temple of Paestum (Greek)  http://www.italianvisits.com/tours/ivtou...    Agrigento and the Valley of the Temples (Greek)  http://www.comune.oliveri.me.it/Foto_Esc...    The Theatre of Taormina (Probably Greeks built it, but Roman decided to enlarge it )  http://twinningblog.files.wordpress.com/...    Moreover you must pay attention to distiguish real classical monuments and neo-classical and pseudo-classical buildings, for example the tower of Pisa, the Dome of Pisa, St. Peter Basilica, the Vittoriano and a lot of other ones...

AA10049824	I go to Las Vegas often. If you haven't been there in several years, you'll notice some of the changes. Because of the ongoing migration from Southern California (and the resulting population growth), it has certainly gotten more restrictive there in recent years.     Voters in Nevada passed an indoor smoking ban in November 2006. Only gaming floors, strip clubs, and some bars (that don't serve any food) are exempt. So, the days of casually lighting up in a Las Vegas restaurant are definitely over.     -----    As for San Francisco, anti-smoking laws are the same as the rest of California. State law prohibits most indoor smoking. Only bars with no employees are exempt (where the owners serve as bartenders themselves). These include:    http://www.sfbg.com/38/51/x_biznews.html    Also, Tosca Cafe in Little Italy has "Smoking Sundays," where most of the staff heads off and you can light up.    http://www.bestofsanfrancisco.net/toscac...    In terms of outdoor smoking, you're technically not allowed to smoke within twenty feet of any government building, school, or church. But the SFPD isn't going to take a tape measure out to see if you're sufficiently far away. They have better things to do. So, this provision is largely unenforced.|`|CvRscCrjaa	i would go to vegas, if you really want to no holds barred party then vegas it is. smoking is really frowned upon in SF.|`|PvV0aNvfaa	not if you like smoking man meat|`|eulMjLtPaa	Smoking is not permitted in bars, restaurants and most enclosed public spaces.      If this is a major problem for you, by all means go to Vegas, where loud and drunk is the norm.  Oops, smoking isn't permitted in casinos.|`|AA10758468	Smoking isn't allowed in bars or restaurants here so you would have to go outside. Las Vegas would be a lot more fun in that respect.|`|s34GP3Ioaa	Well, since you are a bunch of midwestern gun toot-en, tobacco smoking , conservative drunks I would advise going to Las Vegas.  There is pointy of action there 24/7.  Prostitution is legal there and the girls are great.  Just loose the guns unless you have a carrying permit.  You better check the gun laws in Nevada.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Don't even bother going to California.  And you have already contradicted yourself:  "The 3 of us are conservative, gun carrying, veterans, from the Midwest and still believe this country is free. At least in the Midwest we are. We are not redneck country boys either."    Your first sentence in that is the very definition of redneck.  Not that being conservative, gun carrying, or a veteran makes you a redneck, but your defiant declaration of it demonstrates your defensive attitude.
43LL7huoaa	Well..some names of grown ups or adults we cant beleive how they were called with these names when they were young..but guess what they were once young and made it through :D:D:D    While other kids when you call them names such "Tamer","Hany",etc..you start wondering would his name sounds okay with a title like "grandpa"? like grandpa Hany? or grandpa Wa'el?    I think kids name should be some source of confidence to a child and adult even a grandpa..through the whole life cycle..Parents are those who can play this part by pronouncing their children names rightly and explaning for them what their names mean? and why they called him/her with this name? or what example in history ever held such a name?...  Then Im sure you will find that "Malik" name is old, powerful, energetic and filled with confidence and have lots of means and lots of examples in world or arabic history...  there is also some good names for baby boys such as "Ziad", "Zaid", "Tarek", "Omar", "Nour", "Fares", "Saif" and lots and lots..    Finally, Have a good time... and I wish the baby Malik a happy living...:):):)|`|QITjQwJSaa	Yes, very sophisticated...go ahead..thumbs up!|`|ISxdNDeGaa	ooh... I hate Malik baik il jurabar from that syrian series " ilfosool al arba3a" :( lol    I don't really like that name bcoz of the actor lol  :( but maybe if u've named ur baby malik..and I saw ur little cute baby..I'll start liking this name ^_^    edit: I was reading my answer, and I found out that it sounds kinda mean !     let me tell you a story; my aunt wanted to name her baby girl Jude, we've all hated that name and begged her not to name her baby Jude, but she didn't care and named her baby girl " Jude", now I find this name one of the cutest names ever!|`|bqOTeB6Aaa	lol @ JayJay    I like the name Malik!! not bad, but there are better names out there!|`|bl3QXX6Saa	I think it's cute! Malik is a unique name, I've never heard it before. If you like it then I think it sounds good.|`|lVkaALbOaa	noo|`|496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	So long as your surname suits it its a good strong name for a boy and can really only be shortened to Mal.  It would sound best if you have a surname name that doesn't have two syllables as in Mal-ik,a one or three syllable name would be fine.  Malik is different, but not too different and it won't date like a lot of names.  Congratulations to you both..|`|AA11152480	actually we consider it to be the name of our expected baby - In Sha2 Allah- if it will be a boy !  i love this name

2EVoNHHbaa	It was built over a period of over 200 years, which may be why you are confused--there's no one date.  The first portion of the building began construction in the 1790s, but was burnt by the British during the War of 1812.  There was major construction in the 1850s, with the current dome added in the 1860s.  The building was added to pretty continuously over the past 100 years.  The newest part of the building, a visitor center and expansion of office spaces, just opened a couple of months ago.    So, the answer to your question is that construction began in the 1790s, with the building almost continually expanded and improved in the following years, with the most recent addition completed in 2008.

1cJjGNOBaa	we have always bought our tickets online through a sanctioned Disney broker. It saves a little, but since you'll only be there for 2 days, it won't mane a huge difference. As far as money saving tips- bring snacks and water into the park that you have bought at Walmart. Share meals with the kids if they're small enough- the meals are plenty big enough to share. Don't buy soda with the meals- they will take that amount off, and water is better for you anyway. bring strollers, if they are under 6 or so- it's a lot of walking and they WILL get tired- also the baskets underneath and the cup holders are invaluable for carrying stuff. Good Luck and have fun!!!|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Buy your tickets at the hotel,.  Then you know they are legit.  Otherwise buy through AAA  Automobile club of america  To many discounted tickets are fraudulent and you will not know till you get to the gate and the park will not honor them|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Buying tickets from Disney is the same price online as at the gate.  However, I recommend buying ahead of time just to save time in line!  Other than buying directly from Disney, I highly suggest that you buy only from an authorized dealer.  Buying only two-day tickets, you really won't save much.  But you can check out these dealers if you want, all of which are authorized: AAA, http://www.mapleleaftickets.com http://www.undercovertourist.com|`|RrEESD6Paa	Make sure you book your flight and hotel together. I would recommend checking out BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck! Check out the link below.

There's also a lot of commercial development out there as well, new strip malls, theatres, etc., restaurants.  Also, like someone else said, any area around Windsor is also near Detroit, so good for all sorts of professional sporting events, concerts, Broadway bound plays, etc.  You have the opportunity for big city attractions with mid-size town charm.|`|azypqsphaa	isn't it the "Tomato Capital" of Ontario ?...|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Because you can't afford a bus ticket to Toronto?|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Because your only a few hours away from Brampton|`|NWopkX4baa	It's close enough for the benefits of Detroit but far enough away from its disadvantages.

T42Nt3Lyaa	The most expensive schools tend to be those in the so called elite seven, which are boys only boarding schools, these schools follow the model of old fashioned English boarding schools and will be very different to what you are used to in the states,   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Seven    Otherwise if you want to spend less, a government schools known as former model C schools are also very good, these often have much better facilities than ones average private school and offer a good education.    Then there is a long list of private schools which are mostly all pretty good.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Elementary schools? High schools? Colleges?  Why do you think everybody knows what YOU have in mind?|`|moF46oZYaa	There are many really good schools in South Africa, but I went to a small high school near Durban, there were only 50 students. It was nice, we wore civvies each day and the school had a relaxed and informal approach to learning. Unfortunately we lacked the facilities of other schools but we made use of the public library and the park down the road. This school was based on a modern concept of learning, actually an idea from America. I found it to be a great environment to learn in and I really enjoyed it. And now I have a grade 12 which is internationally recognized.  Perhaps you're wondering why I've told you all this and I'm sure by now you're probably getting tired of reading all this text without getting much useful information, no? This is much like your question, you need to be more specific! Please. Are you in primary school or high school for instance? Where in the country are you looking to settle, Cape Town, Durban, Jo'burg....?|`|Z8UjcLKJaa	English I suppose ? Well depends where your going to stay. Cape town I don't know the school names there. But in worcester there's a school that is very good. Pretoria there is waterkloof, menlopark we have very good schools here in South Africa you don't have to be afraid of not finding the right school.

b8yhcxmRaa	Hoover Dam, don't miss that.  If you were staying longer, I would have recommended also driving to the Grand Canyon.  As for a show, one of my personal favorites is Zumanity at New York if the party is all adults.  However, if you have kids, check the links below for family/kids activities in and around Vegas.  http://www.vegas.com/attractions/kids.ht...  http://www.vegas.com/traveltips/guide/fa...|`|urHPuzMsaa	You can tour the Ethyl M. Chocolate Factory in Henderson. You can see how they make the candy plus get some samples as you exit the tour. You can also see their cactus garden just be careful of the one that shoots it's prickers.     In Vegas go to the Tournament of Kings at the Excalibur. It is a great dinner show for the whole family. You have to eat medeval style with your fingers. They encourage you to scream, yell and slap the table with your hands to root on your king. Great show full of energy and the meal is pretty good too. All for around $50 a person.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Well it depends on which hotel your staying at. If you are underage, you cant really gamble or do any of the stuff that most adults do. You can explore many new places in Las Vegas, maybe touristic places like Hoover Dam, Grand Canyon, those are pretty fascinating places for your visit in Las Vegas. The shows on the other hand are very pricey but well worth if you and your family can afford it. But on the bright side, you have a few free attractions on what Las Vegas has to offer, such as the Fountain show by the Bellagio, the Fremont Street Experience in downtown, the free Circus acts in Circus Circus and so forth.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	Hoover Dam is definitely worth a visit.     Unless you're going in the summer, I also recommend Valley of Fire State Park. On the return, drive back through the Lake Mead National Recreation Area for a scenic trip. However, it's too hot to go in the summer months. If you don't want to drive that far, Red Rocks is an alternative.    Death Valley can be done as a day trip, but it's a long day. Again, watch the weather. I don't suggest it during the hot months.    Another answer suggests the Grand Canyon. However, the national park is too far for a four day trip. It's 560 miles round trip. You can go to the so-called "Grand Canyon West" on a day trip, but it's not part of the national park. It's a privately owned tourist trap. Take lots of money if you do this.|`|AA10240904	Las Vegas Springs Preserve  Lake Mead and Hoover Dam  Test Site Museum  Red Rock Canyon and Visitor Center  Bonnie Springs Old Nevada  Bonnie Springs Ranch  Madame Tussauds Wax Museum  Shark Reef  Adventure Dome Amsuement Park  Forum SHops at Caesars    Mystere Cirque Show and Love Cirque Show are family friendly  Phantom of the Opera  Jerssey Boys|`|EJUpcPsKaa	This site has a complete guide of what there is to do and see: http://www.vegas.com/attractions/    It helped me so much on my 2nd visit to Vegas.   The first time I went, I was so lost and actually thought there wasn't much to see and do. But, then I went to that site and saw how much I missed. On the plus side, most of these attractions are free!    I would highly suggest you use their monorail system as transportation, and maybe stay at a hotel where the monorail stops at (to save you some walking time). Also, the total amount of walking you'd do while you're at these stops are no more than 2 miles. The whole strip itself is just 4 miles long.  Go here for details on that: http://lvmonorail.com/  It's about $12 a ticket, but it lasts you 24 hours from the time you use the actual ticket.  Trust me, if you stick to this, you'll save so much time and money.    As for shows, it would just depend on what you're into, or how much you're willing to spend. The shows are quite pricey ranging from $30 - 300. Most hotels have discounts, so ask them about it.    Have fun =)|`|FWWj3mvLaa	how old are the family member, ie any children/ ethel m chjoclate factory in henbderson has tours, adventurre dome at circus circus, librace musum for the old timers, botanical gardns/dolphin habitat at the mirage...get a fodors las vegas book...very helpful and full of ideas.|`|Om11iR7waa	If you're traveling in the winter or spring you can go climbing at Red Rock Canyon and skiing on Charleston mountain.    We've done both several times and they are both absolutely fantastic.    Look out for afternoon shows.

You will find no place as beautiful as Ponce, Isabella, Aguadilla, San German, Cuyey, Combat Beach, The Crash Boat, the Bacardi Rum distillery(free samples:-) and the beach at Isabella having lunch and drinking an ice cold Medalla...

If you want to get into warmer weather in March you could probably get to New Orleans pretty easily in two days.

4oLThcKEaa	The cheapest option is to take either bus no.340 (more direct) or 341 from one of the stations outside the terminal and that runs to the central bus station in Santa Cruz de Tenerife called La Avenida Maritima. It takes approx. 1 hour 10 minutes and what i did was i bought what is called a BONO-BUS card from the ticket desk at the airport for 30euros. It can be used by more than 1 person and gives you the equivalent of 18 bus rides, which effectively saves you money especially on longer journeys such as the one you are taking.    Alternatively you can take a taxi, but we were quoted approx. 65 euros by the taxi driver so we opted for the bus!    Have a great time!!
