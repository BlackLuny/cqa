c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.<br>  <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.

I have this on my family plan, and it pays for itself in no time. Messages are $0.15 per message sent and received without a messaging bundle, so 133 messages covers the price of the bundle. These bundles are for messages to and from anyone on any network in the US. T-Mobile doesn't do the "in network" messaging junk. If you really think about it, "in network" messaging is a gimmick that will end up costing you more money.|`|XT8rCpRbaa	No, so far text messages still have their own rates.

If you get one, you will have to deal with iTunes, Bad sound quality (SQ) (even non-audiophiles can tell the difference between an iPod and say... a Sansa Clip) and bad battery life.<br>  <br>  Shop around, you'll find something better, that costs less. It will have better battery life, more codec support, better SQ and you won't need to use iTunes.<br>  <br>  Try the website below for more information, but remember NEVER USE STOCK EARBUDS! (Unless you buy a Zune 80, Zen X-Fi or a Sony S series or A series Walkman)<br>  <br>  <br>  I would reccomend a player such as the<br>  <br>  Sansa Fuze<br>  Sony S630<br>  Samsung Yp-P3<br>  Cowon S9<br>  Cowon D2<br>  <br>  and many more!|`|3piD14gAaa	I think the 32 Gigabyte is worth for the money value because when you think about tripling the 8 Gigabyte for $170 but the iPod Touch 16 Gigabyte is what I have and would be fine.

nrvIJTHAaa	This isn't about what's 'allowed.' The PSP has no limitation to the number of songs or their length.<br>  <br>  This is about what fits on the memory stick. If the PSP still ships with a memory card, it's probably a small one. You'll be able to fit less music on it. How many songs depends on the bit rate and duration of each track.<br>  <br>  If you really want to figure out how many songs will fit in a particular space, you can follow the information in this article to figure it out: <a href="http://www.techlore.com/article/15914/How-Many-Songs-Are-Supposed-to-Fit-on-My-MP3-Player-/" rel="nofollow">http://www.techlore.com/article/15914/Ho...</a>|`|DHuEqvYVaa	I depends on the memory stick you buy. For example, a 1GB will have enough songs to last the night away. lol. And a 2GB will last even longer. You will need a memory stick, the PSP won't play songs, videos, or pictures without it. I hope this helped. If you have any more questions, let me know!!

3CJAUyqPaa	You can get a video editor that can deal with the very highly compressed AVCHD video format (MTS). Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere float to the top for Windows/Vista machines; iMovieHD ('08-'09) and FinalCut for MacOS machines...<br>  <br>  If you have a capture card like a Pinnacle Dazzle, you can import analog video using the AV port (and cable) on the camcorder rather than copy the (apparently useless) files over USB...<br>  <br>  There is nothing broken - so nothing to "fix". This is not a Sony video cam "problem". This is how it was designed.|`|AA11629848	All the answers are good, but, just in case you decide to use Sony Vegas Pro 8 make sure is version c (Pro 8c), 8a and 8b don't support AVCHD. For Premiere use CS4 not CS3.|`|42tTsVuxaa	Little dogs right, <br>  <br>  Get a trial version of adobe premiere,  Nero, or even Sony Vegas, <br>  <br>  AVCHD is a highly compressed video format I hope your pc is up to the job its going to make it work very hard. <br>  <br>  Nero is worth a try its simple and only 300mb Premiere is a lot more. Not sure about Vegas. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR
3CJAUyqPaa	"Sony software" is not needed. What is needed is a video editing application that can deal with that highly compressed AVCHD video. Sony Vegas or Adobe Premier float to the top for Windows machines; iMovieHD ('08-'09) or FinalCut for MacOSX machines running Intel CPUs.<br>  <br>  You did not tell us which computer you are using.<br>  <br>  iMovieHD ('08-'09) is bundled with new Macs... So I guess that is already "free". There may be some Windows utilites or apps out there - but none that are free and can be recommended - of which I am aware...|`|P5MMxGxHaa	Sony Vegas <br>  <br>  no free version.

lkqjJisaaa	The other two previous answers are not correct, and I don't know why they answer if they've never used the D40 or don't know the answer to your question.<br>  <br>  Here's the scoop.  U have the D40, which uses i-TTL flash metering, which fires a pre-flash to do flash calculations.  If U do what the "pro" suggested, the pre-flash will prematurely trigger the SB-600.  Thus, U need to first disable the i-TTL pre-flash.  And while U can trigger the SB-600 remotely, U can't control TTL remotely.<br>  <br>  So, here's method.  First, go into custom setting menu item 14, and select manual flash.  Ace is wrong again; the flash guide number at ISO 200 in manual mode is 59 (or 18, if you measure in meters).  Here's how U work with manual flash.  At full-power, U take the guide number and divide it by the distance from the camera to subject.  So, at ISO 200, with flash at full power, if your subject is 7.3 feet away, you get 59/7.3 = approximately 8 or set your aperture to f/8.  If your subject is 10 feet away 59/10 = 5.9 or set your aperture at around 5.6.<br>  <br>  This requires some math, but for a posed situation where U can take your time, it can be done.<br>  <br>  So that takes care of using the pop-up flash.<br>  <br>  Next, U want to trigger the SB-600.  By having the pop-up flash in manual mode, it won't send out a pre-flash and do an early trigger.  For the SB-600, get a simple slave sensor with a hotshoe.  eBay has them for under $10.  The slave will see the pop-up flash fire and trigger the SB-600.  The problem with the cactus wireless trigger is that the transmitter needs to be in the hotshoe and thus, it blocks the popup flash from popping up.  And the receiver is triggered by radio, not by a light sensor, so the receiver won't work as a slave with the popup flash.<br>  <br>  On the SB-600, U have to set that up in manual mode as well and make flash calculations using the guide number of 138 (in feet, at ISO 200) to control output.  So half power should be half of 138, or 69.  U can adjust the power output of the SB-600 via the menu; too bright and U turn the power down; not bright enough, turn the power up.<br>  <br>  So, that's how U trigger an SB-600 remotely with a D40 popup flash.<br>  <br>  set camera to manual flash (menu item 14)<br>  set the proper aperture (do the math using the guide number divided by distance)<br>  set SB-600 in a slave sensor hotshoe<br>  set SB-600 power output by putting into manual flash and adjusting output in SB-600 menu.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	I don't know how wimpy the in-camera flash is ... It has a Guide number of about 11 at ISO 200.  If your subject is closer than 11 feet the in-camera will do its job as a flash fill and it should set off your SD600 in the background as long as you subject does not cast a shadow on the SB600's sensor|`|n71t0xoCaa	Sure you can you can use an optical slave or radio trigger device to fire the SB600 or you can even use a PC cord if you are not hung up on being wireless for many shots they are a cost effective alternative and do not really get in the way that much. Just dial the SB600 down to the flash ratio you want. Using the onboard flash the optical slave may be your best option

d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	here's what i did:<br>  I performed a successful tethered jailbreak on my ipod touch 2G one month ago using the RedSn0w tool for windows 32 bit, and I have used Cydia and Installer flawlessly. I rebooted or turned off the ipod a few times since (just to see it was possible), and everything is going great. Here is the site of the guide I used:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/gui-jailbreaking-ipod-touch-2nd-gen-application-for-windows-released/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  This is the best GUI method out there, and really easy and quick (I used codename: Cynw00d). Follow the instructions carefully, and you should be set. The links of where to download the app are there. But you'll need the firmware ipsw file its self. I used the latest version of firmware for the ipod touch (5H11a) and it works great. Here is a trustworthy site where I always get my ipod touch firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  So thats it! Thats all you need to know! I will say this, there is this one step in the app where you need to select the firmware that you will patch to jailbreak. The first time I did this, I didn't highlight it. Everything wil seem okay, but a later step won't work. So don't forget to highlight the firmware you wish to use for the jailbreak when the app asks you!<br>  <br>  ~ilz|`|YdMmERk1aa	Yeah you can.

19531196a60641f47f4076b1eb9e694eaa	It's not that you have to reformat it it's just that apple or the iPod only allows you to consolidate from one library. So if you try to use another itune library it's going to erase all the songs from the old library and install all the songs from the new library. That's how mine is to even tough both of the computer have windows on them.|`|AA12180617	you only need to format the ipod as windows if you want to pair it with a windows machine. and the ony reasonto do this is to swap music .. the mac can read windows formatted machines but an ipod cna only PAIR with one machine at a time.  do NOT use the ipod as a exchange media...<br>  <br>  if you must be illegal and copy music copy the files direct form teh itunes music folder and do not rely on the ipod.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can pair the ipod to a windows machine and it will sync and set it to windows file system which you CAN read on a mac but when you pair it with a mac to sync it it will overwrite that gain with the Mac formatting  but only if you press restore otherwise it will keep using the Windows format..<br>  <br>  Why do people assume that the ipod is a music backup system - its NOT!<br>  <br>  the Master files are on the computer in the itunes library and you really need to back these up directly.<br>  Thats NOT they way its designed to work the ipod is a slave device to ONE itunes only although itunes can have many ipods. When you PAIR an iPod with a computer it erases all songs on it!!! and deletes pairing with original computer.<br>  <br>  Sharing Copyrighted material such as Movies or Music is also illegal!<br>  <br>  You cannot transfer music from an ipod to itunes as Itunes is the MASTER location of the music files. if you NEED to transfer music form your ipod to the computer as you have lost the original you need a 3rd party application (I use Yamipod for mac) but a whole range can be found on www.versiontracker.com and enter ipod transfer in the search box under your operating system.<br>  <br>  I suggest copying the contents of the "iTunes Music" folder on your old computer onto the new one by USB hard disk, USB Flash memory or DVD-r<br>  <br>  once you have the utility installed run it and close itunes! connect the ipod (if itunes starts up and asks if you want to pair say NO and close itunes again). then with the utility transfer the songs form the ipod to your hard disk.<br>  <br>  Then disconnect the ipod, START itunes... drop the files you have just transferred onto the itunes Library and once the files have been copied into the library you can delete the originals (NEVER MOVE or touch the itunes folder on your computer otherwise you will lose the music let itunes manage it for you).<br>  <br>  Now reconnect the ipod and when it asks pair say YES and it will transfer the music to your computer.

AA12145054	The substance, originally intended as a shellac substitute, turned out to be an astonnishing multi-purpose talent. It was superior to other substances in many regards and employable in varied fields so that BAEKELAND hit on the marketing slogan "The Material of a Thousand Uses". Already in the twenties the first entire sythetic plastic was indispensable in most industry branches. - The plastic era had begun.<br>  <br>  Although it is no longer extensively used as an industrial manufacturing material, in the past Bakelite was used in myriad applications, such as saxophone mouthpieces, cameras, solid-body electric guitars, rotary-dial telephones, early machine guns, and appliance casings. It was at one point considered for the manufacture of coins, due to a shortage of traditional manufacturing material. In 1943, Bakelite and other non-metal materials were tested for usage as a penny in the United States before the Mint settled on zinc coated steel.|`|wkLTTr06aa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  Before bakelite was invented and came into general use there was notning else like it.<br>  <br>  Products had to be manufactured of wood or metal, etc.<br>  That meant square or rounded corners ( an industrial look). <br>  <br>  Of course things could be molded by pouring molten metal into molds after which they would be smoothed and polished.<br>  <br>  This meant most everything you could buy was either made of wood or metal. Usually heavy and having an industrial look.<br>  <br>  Then bakelite was invented and it changed everything. <br>  Now almost any shape you wanted could be made cheaply and light weight.<br>  <br>  Another important property of bakelite was it's very high resistance to the flow of electric current. <br>  That made it an ideal product for making distributor caps for cars and anything having to do with electricity that needed to be a good insulator.<br>  <br>  There is a link below with more information.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Al

tDA970aRaa	MP means Mega Pixel<br>  <br>  Digital cameras capture images as pixel elements, known as pixels. Simply put, a megapixel is equal to one million pixels.<br>  <br>  Digital images are made up of thousands of these tiny, tile-like picture elements. The more pixels, the higher the image resolution. Resolution relates primarily to print size and the amount of detail an image has when viewed on a computer monitor at 100%.<br>  <br>  The number of megapixels is only one aspect relating to the quality of a camera, or the actual quality of a photo it is capable of producing. Factors such as camera sensor and the optical quality of a lens play equally important roles.<br>  <br>  If you buy a digital camera with too few megapixels for your printing and editing needs, photos may be degraded.  A photo made into a poster sized print from a camera with a low megapixel count will look fuzzy. So will a digital image that is cropped to much.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	MP stands for - Mega Pixels or Million Pixels.<br>  <br>  This is the amount of points in the camera that capture light.<br>  The more Pixels the sharper the item in the image if you wish to enlarge the photo or print it. Usually for good prints you need 4 MP or higher, but for PC use or cell Phone use 2MP is more than enough.|`|ZZCATJeQaa	well its megapixels which refers to maximum resolution capacity of the camers ok|`|nrvIJTHAaa	MP stands for "mega pixels," which refers to the maximum capture resolution of the camera's sensor. <br>  <br>  If you want to learn all about mega pixels, you should check out this great article from TechLore: <a href="http://www.techlore.com/article/17089/The-Megapixel-Myth/" rel="nofollow">http://www.techlore.com/article/17089/Th...</a>|`|NOIseyASaa	MP stands for Mega Pixels.

w7Ffw6MYaa	It depends, personally I think that the Slash is just fine, I have one in my collection. I use it right now and its pretty cool. Here is a list of comparions/contrasts that may help make up your mind. <br>  <br>  The Slash and Shuttle both have.....<br>  <br>  ?Picture messaging<br>  ?E-mail messaging<br>  ?Instant messaging<br>  ?Virgin XL access<br>  ?A sliding mechanism<br>  <br>  The Shuttle has these features and the Slash DOES NOT....<br>  <br>  ? better camera (1.3 mp vs. 0.3 mp)<br>  <br>  ? EVDO vs. 1x data (shuttle is the only evdo phone from Virgin Mobile, its really fast on the web, sending pictures, etc.)<br>  <br>  ? MP3 player<br>  <br>  ? Video capture<br>  <br>  ? External memory card slot for MicroSD cards <br>  <br>  ** The Slash is ok for my opinion (I got it on sale at Radio Shack for $60 a couple of months ago). Its got a decent camera, but does not have as near as many features as the Shuttle does. If you want to pay $20 more, thats great because you get some really good features that the Slash does not have. The only thing that may change your mind is that the Slash is branded by Samsung, the Shuttle is generic but is still a great phone. **<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)
PNPqujCTaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The Tele that you have, if  a "Stock" guitar, has "Single Coil" pickups.<br>  <br>  This is a common noise with those style pickups.  That's why the deveopement of the Dual Coil, or "Humbucking" pickups of Gibson fame.  However, nothing wrong with the single coil pickups.  I know some players that wouldn't use anything else cause of their unique tonal qualities.  Does the name Hendrix ring a bell?<br>  <br>  What to do?  Since that model Marshal does not have a "Ground" switch on board, you shuld first use a "Ground Lift Adapter" (3pin to 2pin) at the point where the amp plugs into the wall.  If that does not do the trick, reverse the polarity of the gound lift adapter (unplug it from the wall, flip it 180 degrees, and plug it back in).<br>  <br>  As well, if you're playing under flourescent lights, turn those off.  Those type lights can induce the same kind of noise in you pickups.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the reason the noise diminishes when you put your fingers on the strings is that your body acts as a suplemental ground (fun with the physics of music).<br>  db|`|NQURVW9Zaa	Check your connectors.It could be dust
AA12090277	Let me be honest here; a lot of the answers on Yahoo! (or anywhere) will lean towards the iPod no matter what, because most people buy into it, and don't try other stuff. So I don't know if you want to rely on their answers...<br>  <br>  Zunes are nice, but they're great at playing media; they don't have internet browsing functionality yet (it's current controls wouldn't make it a convenient anyway...). So if you want a nice PMP to play media, Zune's way better than the iPod Classics and whatnot.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest the Cowon S9, or Samsung P2 (or upcoming P3), or the iriver SPINN. <br>  <br>  I don't know about cameras, but I'm quite sure these all have radio functionality.|`|9dvmMRX4aa	The Zune has wi-fi, but the iPod Touch is much better|`|iqUGDn6kaa	The Zune does have it, but its no where near as good as the Touch.

K01NU24saa	Sony and Samsung compete to top spot in the global LCD tv. Samsung , Sony. Panasonic.Sharp Hi-End LCD tv same Quality. Sony and Samsung use the same LCD display panel made in Korea by S-LCD, a Display panel manufactures joint venture between two.Some big screen Sony TV use Sharp Japan made panel. Sharp as world largest LCD panel maker.If put hi-end model by Sharp/Sony/Samsung/Panasonic side by side, play the same pictures/image, you eye will no get any defence between.|`|RHPWqF30aa	Samsung is the worlds largest producer of LCD's and they make pretty good TV's, but I think the Panasonic units have darker black colors and brighter colors.  Sony is alright, but they haven't really innovated anything special.  I tend to buy my stuff from Costco only because they have a 90-day return policy.|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	Samsung,<br>  and yes most stores have a 90 day return policy on LCD TV's and and extra 9 months throught the company, unless you buy a warranty then an extra 2 yrs.|`|B7VE3LFlaa	samsung|`|LXiBCERZaa	My sony LCD tv sucks pretty bad. It's had some problems with the light block, which screws the picture all up and gives you purple spots all over the place. Luckily I for once bought the extended warranty and they have replaced the part TWICE already (which is 1100 bucks btw). It's working now, but it probably won't in three months. I'd stay away from Sony.

V4ZSGQBoaa	The conduit is going to be huge.  It is really the first wii game that will really push the systems capabilities.  Wii is capable of doing a lot more than many think.  The Conduit will be compatible with wii speak, the voice chat system for wii.  It will also be compatible with wii motion plus which will come out soon also and will make the wii remote more reactive to movement(every direction you move your arm, your character will too on the video for wii sports resort).  It will be 16 player online, and will so far have team death-match and free for all modes, but more im sure will be added.  They are taking more time to work on it and it will release in June on the 9th of 09.  This extra time they are using to upgrade the graphics to like xbox 360.  Also they may include split screen online play so that more than one person can play on NWC at once.  They have really gone all out on this game.  It will not only be revolutionary for the wii, but for other systems too.  Its not coming out on others but it will include some things that have never been done before.  One thing that is already done is a fully customizable HUD.  You can move your health bar and everything around and even make them more or less transparent.  Also to dead zone and buttons are customizable.  Not very many games for wii out right now are pushing the systems capabilities.  It is just that the different control scheme is new to them.  They have even found ways to use the physics engines from other games from other systems like the CoD 4 system.  This game is just going to be awesome.  I already pre-ordered it from gamestop.com.  Sorry this is so long, but im just psyched about this game!|`|mKReqC7waa	Yeah, King KFC pretty much got every little detail about the game right.

It sounds like you phone battery may be gone and you may need to replace it.

BMConIedaa	Right now, on the Wii, the only game similar to the GTA series is The Godfather: Blackhand Edition.  It is quite violent, and the motion gestures give it a visceral element that the 360 and PS3 ports lack.  <br>  <br>  No More Heroes is sort of similar, as well, but not there's no car-jacking - just the (anti-)hero's motorcycle.  But its still very fun, and quite violent.  <br>  <br>  Neither game has a copter tho.<br>  <br>  Also, Saint's Row isn't for the PS3.  It is a 360 exclusive.<br>  <br>  GTA: Chinatown Wars is coming out for the DS soon.

Some programs like iTunes and KMPlayer have built-in normalizers that attempt to keep your songs' volumes consistent - which can mean that they may sound louder overall when you boost the volume.... however, that depends on the song itself.<br>  <br>  You can use an audio editor program like Audacity or Goldwave to EQ the mp3 directly (ie permanently) as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

We had to writ programs in bytes or pixels before hard drives  windows or macs were invented. Painstaking and long hours of work. Dos or similar methods were used. Learning to make a simple picture meant placing a dot in the right spot on the screen. One dot at a time. Long lines of code had to be written page after page of code to animate a picture. We have it easy today.
xTioPxaVaa	There's actually quite a few good guitars in that price range now...<br>  <br>  Fender - any of of Made In Mexico series.  Same construction and materials as the US made ones, just assembled and painted in Mexico<br>  <br>  Epiphone - Gibson designed and built overseas.  These days, an outstanding value<br>  <br>  Schecter - My favorite import.  Hard to go wrong with any of them.  All of the guitars that come in go through their set up shop to set string height, intonation, and check that the net is filed correctly.  Take it out of the case, and you're ready to rock.<br>  <br>  Ibanez - Personally, I don't own any of these, but a lot of people swear buy them.<br>  <br>  Buying a guitar is one of those things that's very difficult to do without actually going to a store, picking them up, and playing them.  Sometimes even different guitars of the same brand will feel slightly different.  You'll know when you pick it up if it's right for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from AUstin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken
PDB2YbA4aa	The cheapest one I found is $123.95, and you will have to pay a $50 activation fee only if you have them do it in the store.

xTioPxaVaa	The short answer is no.<br>  <br>  If they are truly active pickups (such as EMG 81's), then they have electronic circuitry that requires power in order to pass a signal.  No battery, no signal.<br>  <br>  Active pickups work on the principal of winding a pickup coil with much fewer turns than your standard passive one.  By doing that, they get a pickup with a very wide frequency responce.  Then, they incorporate amplification on the pickup itself to make up for the lack of signal from the coil.<br>  <br>  The only way to convert your guitar to passive operation is to change out the pickups.  And if you do, you will need to change the volume and tone controls out.  Active guitars use controls that are way too low in value to work correctly with passive pickups. <br>  <br>  Now, a lot of basses have active electronics in the instrument, but the pickups themselves are still passive.  If you have active EQ on your instrument (ie; bass, mid, and treble controls that will boost and cut), then that's what you've got.  It's possible to bypass the electronics and run the bass in a passive mode (in fact, I've done this modification to all of my active basses just in case the electronics or batteries fail during performance.  I can flip a switch and keep going).<br>  <br>  A good guitar tech can guide you with this.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

q3CNTfvKaa	I have been a Blackberry corporate user for 5 years and swore by the device... then in October last year, I crossed over and bought an iPhone.   WOW is all I can say!<br>  <br>  When the Storm came out, I went to the VZWireless store to do side by side comparisons with my iPhone... and the Storm performed miserably.  Search capabilities were lagging, my friend searched and I searched for simple website such as Hilton Hotels, American Airlines and Marriott Hotels.  The iPhone found the sites within 5 seconds.  The Storm froze twice and at best found the sites within 60-90 seconds.  Not good if you're impatient, it was like using dial up!!!  The reason for its slowness is that iPhone has better search capabilities,  millions of large businesses have already made their websites capable for the iPhone protocol so searching, ordering and buying online with an iPhone is so much more efficient.  iPhone can use Wifi,  Storm can't so you are subject to the hardware and how efficient the network is flowing when you want to connect to the net.<br>  <br>  App store is untouchable and only compatible with iPhone - millions of  apps that make your life easy!  Easy to download and easy to delete.<br>  <br>  Storm touch screen really sucks.  I thought I'd like it because I was used to the keys on the blackberry but its really annoying and inaccurate.  iPhone uses a smart pad so it learns the user's words and keystrokes to personalize your typing.<br>  <br>  Pricewise - calling plans are somewhat similar for AT&T and Verizon but i Found AT&T's to be more comprehensive.  <br>  <br>  Storm is not user friendly either.  I didn't have to read the manual to fully take advantage of all the frills on the iPhone.  I love having my iPod and phone all in one!  Multitasking with the iPhone is also very easy (taking a call, text messaging, web surfing..etc)<br>  <br>  Good luck but as a 5 year Blackberry devotee, I have to say, I submit to the iPhone!|`|c178xF24aa	I bought the Storm this past December and it's okay.

I have bought other phones off the internet (ebay, etc) when my verizon cell phone broke and as long as they were either unlocked or verizon compatible with just a simple phone call that phone was connected to my number and plan. Contact verizon directly if you have any questions about fees associated or the actual process of doing this (it was free when I did it personally)
AA10255483	there are several audio manufacturers that offer hdmi audio interface but from what I have read, as I am in the market for one also, there seems to be a lot of problems with audio/video synch.  Also be careful which receiver you buy because some of the earlier models cannot decode the lossless audio provided on blu-ray discs such as Dolby True HD or DTS-HD Master Audio.  Some of the newer one will do the decoding or make sure your blu-ray player has built in decoding like the Panasonic BD30 that I use.  Cnet reviews are very informative on home audio equipment reviews.

j5Apt8hWaa	You want the brightest screen you can get, since you will not be doing any photo manipulation with it outside, so reflections in the screen can be controlled by you.  I am surprised that your Mac Professional Consultant did not know the answer to your question<br>  <br>  What you need to be more concerned about is colour and contrast calibration of the screen.  You will need some kind of calibration tool if you plan on using your MacBook for making corrections in any of the important parameters of the images, like colour hue, saturation, contrast or brightness.  An uncalibrated monitor can do more damage that an improperly expose image file.<br>  <br>  Unless you are going to use a second, large monitor attached to your MacBook, you may want to consider waiting until you can get to your Mac Pro before making any changes in your images.

AA12275186	HDMI can be converted to VGA however HDMI is a digital signal where VGA is analog. Because of this you would need a active device such as a scaler. A sclaer will "Scale video" from one resolution or format to another. Kramer Electronics, TV one and many others make scales. Be prepared to pay because these devices are not cheap!

LBAh1tPoaa	They are entirely different phones in both concept and functionality. The BlackBerry is oriented toward a business phone with fast and secure communications, a business suite, instant email, and BlackBerry messenger for anytime anywhere BlackBerry to BlackBerry chat. <br>  <br>  The BlackBerry 3G touch-screen phone, Storm, the one most often compared with an iPhone also has a camera and full multimedia capability. The real difference is on the plans associated with each phone. The BlackBerry is an internet phone, not an ordinary phone that can use WiFi (when available) to connect to the internet. As such is is only available with an unlimited internet plan that allows browsing, email, most IM apps and things like Facebook, MySpace, and Flickr as well as full GPS navigation capability. <br>  <br>  It comes back to choice, a business phone or a playphone. I have both and far prefer the BlackBerry, it is faster texting or writing email, and has better battery life as well as the push (instantly received) email function.<br>  <br>  Choose wisely

There is NO WAY if you cut that panel it will ever work.<br>  <br>  OK Part B - explaining why it will not work.<br>  a) A panel has a specified amount of pixels, say 1360x736. If you cut part of it, then you cut pixels. Your TV knows how to display 1360x736 pixels, but not 1000 x 650, or whatever is left over from the surgery.<br>  b) Video quality is stronly related to a specific panel.

Just click on the box once and the tick should disappear, leaving the box empty. <br>  <br>  When you then sync your iPod with your iTunes library, it then loads onto your iPod only the tracks that are still ticked. Any 'un-ticked' tracks (or ones you've removed from the iTunes library) are then taken off your iPod. This also has the benefit of allowing you to remove songs you don't like off each album, leaving only with the stuff you actually want on your iPod.<br>  <br>  Note that by unticking the box next to a song track on iTunes doesn't remove it from iTunes - it's still there, it just doesn't get placed on your iPod. If in future, you want to reinstate the track, just put the tick back into the box to the left of the track title.|`|BQsPZZfYaa	Here's instructions: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1204" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1204</a>|`|FGYh0U2yaa	make a playlist and sync only the playlist

Be careful to observe POLARITY   (+)    and   (-)    this is critical.<br>  <br>  First of all......the VOLTAGE of the battery and the Transformer must be the SAME.......12VDC or thereabouts.<br>  <br>  If your load (device you are hooking up) draws more Amperes (AMPS) then the Transformer will supply, the battery WILL make up the difference.<br>  <br>  The problem will come.....if you let the battery get too low and the transformer has to do provide more AMPS than it is capable.  You could end up burning up the Transformer OR an internal component of the Transformer.  To prevent this, place a FUSE in-line with the output (+) of the Transformer that is rated at the same AMPS that the output of the Transformer AMPS.<br>  <br>  Please put ANOTHER fuse in-line with the output of the Battery/Transformer combo line that is rated just above the AMPS of your Load device.

rtqbpLm5aa	Generally speaking,  a true "subwoofer" is designed to cover the lower register of the 20 to 20,000 Hz frequency spectrum (which is aligned to human hearing range). Thusly, subwoofers aim to reproduce sounds that are at or below 50 Hz. These sounds are oftentimes referred to as "sub-bass" frequencies, especially those in the 25 Hz or lower register. At this frequency, the speaker cone must displace a tremendous amount of air, since sound waves this low are quite long. This requires a prodigious amount of amplifier power and a very robust speaker driver (or drivers) that have high excursion (or how far back and forth it can move) capabilities. Subwoofers also tend to be quite large, relying on the internal air inside the enclosure to reinforce the sound wave produced by the speaker cone's movement. <br>  <br>  Bass speaker can refer to a number of different things.<br>  <br>  1. A speaker that reproduces bass frequencies (i.e. ~50 Hz and below)<br>  2. A component that intends to act like a subwoofer, but ultimately falls short (i.e. Most computer speaker "subwoofers" and Bose Acoustimass Modules). The reason is that they simply cannot reproduce the full spectrum of sub-bass frequencies below 25 Hz.<br>  <br>  Bass speakers themselves can be found in multi-way speaker cabinets, or can be used in a subwoofer. <br>  <br>  One example of how bass speakers can be used to actually achieve sub-bass levels of sound is the Martin Logan Depth subwoofer. This uses three 8" bass speakers to create the equivalent of a 12-15" subwoofer speaker. Through sophisticated equalization and amplifier technology, it can actually do a good job with very low distortion. Granted, the subwoofer costs $2000. <br>  <br>  Normally, however, be wary of "subwoofers" that have cones smaller than 10-12" as these will almost always fail at reproducing sub-bass (below 30 Hz) with the kind of low distortion and high SPL that you would get with a larger speaker.|`|jBIotay5aa	A bass speaker cover the lower frequencies of the audio spectrum including lower mid frequencies usually between 20 hertz to 8000 hertz.<br>  <br>  I think the correct meaning for subwoofer would be a loudspeaker that can produce low frequencies usually below 50 hertz that our ears find more difficult to locate do to the ear's directional design. Frequencies generated below your range of hearing can be felt at high sound pressure levels.<br>  <br>  I think it's just marketing hype that that they call most bass speakers subwoofers, even though they cannot produce sub frequencies. Subwoofers in audio system are not supposed to be located by ear, in fact they should only be adding foundation to the sound reproduction. A subwoofer that you can locate by ear usually muddles the stereo image due to it being mostly mono devices, so the subwoofer should actually enhance the reproduction and not dominate it.
AA11256390	Phone companies can block both phones and SIMs these days and frequently do it when handsets are stolen to prevent them from being used. If you have purposely stopped paying the bill when you are meant to be and they are aware of that then O2 would be within their rights to block both to prevent you from using them. If you have just not payed one bill then I'd be very surprised if they've done that. If you're trying to activate a new SIM in it try using it with iTunes as you did when it was new it will quite possibly activate using that method as all iPhones and SIMs need activating this way

jBIotay5aa	I can think of two ways of connecting your tv sound to your home theatre system. <br>  <br>  1) There should be two phono plugs on the back of your tv, one red and one white. This is a preamp output of your tv sound(sound not controlled by your tv's volume control). This will send a sound signal to your home theatre system allowing you to control your tv volume via your home theatre system remote.<br>  <br>  2) You can also connect a cable from your headphone output to your home theatre system. This allows you to control your tv sound from your tv. This is however frowned on by most audiophiles as it will cause a higher noise floor if your home theatre system is turned up high(more hiss or slight electrical noise). Handy though if you don't like juggling between remote controls.

H5tvzBoGaa	once they're fully merged into verizon|`|qpXPJ1pLaa	Right now T-Mobile is the only carrier to have that phone in the US so you'll have to wait until it gets released to all the big carriers. However, if  alltel phones use SIM cards then you can purchase a used T-Mobile curve and put your alltel SIM card into the tmobile phone. I have done that before with an AT&T phone and a T-Mobile SIM card.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped
w4I9oj2Maa	Did it work BEFORE you transported it to your home?  If so, Soldering will fix it....<br>  <br>  If it was dead BEFORE you even bought it, I hope you didn't spend much...IT could be anything, and most likely the seller KNEW it would be expensive.
8Raw4M1naa	The problems thats been had with either the 360 or PS3 vertically is that it has the potential to scatch the discs easier. What happens is when the system sits up and down, the disc is sitting verically as well, making it less stable. If you bump the system or even something its sitting on, the jostle can cause the disc hit against the tray its sitting in, causing a nice circular scratch along the edge of whatever is in your system. Sometimes it will still run, and other times it ruins the disc. I would reccommend putting it horizontally, if only for that reason. Games are too expensive to risk.|`|7aqimHVfaa	Its entirely up to you. It's meant to be able to work both horizontaly and vertically - thats why the PS logo on the console rotates. <br>  <br>  I personally have mine vertically, because it takes up less space and at a diagonal alongside the TV it looks great.|`|4gyrvY7Jaa	Either way works the same, because either way you put it, there is not vent on the base.|`|AA11902365	I put it both ways I don't think it really matters just as long as it's stable.|`|L6zTF5ZGaa	ps3- horizontal<br>  <br>  xbox 360- vertical|`|jxpV13rTaa	it is designed to withstand both vertical and horizontal positions, but i like it best horizontal..looks...safer.. i know i wont knock it down at least|`|N2rntAqvaa	It depends on how much space you have, and where you are putting it, and what you are putting it on.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend keeping it horizontally, if possible, because in my opinion it's more stable, and it is safer, since it can't fall off of something (unless you push it).  <br>  <br>  If you put it vertically, something might hit it and it could fall and break.  Just to be safe, put it horizontally.<br>  <br>  But it won't ruing the console if you put it vertically, since Sony gave the PS3 (and PS2) the opportunity to stand both vertically and horizontally.  They always make it stand vertically on the pictures, since it looks nicer.  But don't you think it's better to be safe and enjoy the games, instead of risking it and not enjoying the games after it breaks?

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	What type of cables are you using?  The composite (yellow, red, white) or component (red, green, blue, red, white)?  If you're using the composite cables, then you're not watching or playing games in HD.  If you're using the component and you have the PS3 set up for 720p/1080i/1080p, then you're watching and playing in HD. <br>  <br>  HDMI is a possible option to use, but you don't need it to get HD.|`|oB2au3ezaa	You need the whole package to get the most out of HD.  That includes an HDTV, HDMI cable and compatible blu-ray player or hi-def game system.  A way to tell if you're watching your movies or playing your games in HD is to hit the Display button on your TV remote.  It should then display your current resolution.  All the blu-ray movies I've played show up in 1080i/p and most games are at least 720p if not in 1080p.  If you don't have an HDMI cable, a component cable may work instead but I recommend an HDMI cable.

rnhmNxOMaa	First off, you must be on T-Mobile if you are considering a Sidekick. <br>  <br>  Your questions: What's a mail-in rebate?<br>  A mail-in rebate entitles the buyer to mail in a coupon, a receipt and barcode in order to receive a check for an amount depending on what you bought, where you bought it, and at what time.<br>  <br>  ***Why does my mom think that there will be extra fees?<br>  Your mom probably thinks that there will be extra fees because unless you are near the end of your contract, you will be paying more then what you see in stores or online. With T-Mobile, you are only eligible to receive the best price if you have been on your contract for 11 months on a one year, or 22 months on a 2 year contract. Also, there are taxes and other charges that might not show up until you are purchasing. When you get a Sidekick, you also have to pay for a data plan, which go from 24.99 a month (unlimited data and 400 messages) to 34.99 a month (unlimited data and messages).<br>  <br>  Yeah... I have a RAZR V3 too. :/|`|jxHm9iikaa	LOL!<br>  <br>  No.  You can't just upgrade.  It does cost you FULL RETAIL PRICE to just get a cell phone when you want.<br>  <br>  UNLESS you get it off of eBay.  You can buy and "Upgrade" If you buy the phone off eBay FIRST.  But to go throught the company to BUY the phone will cost you A LOT.|`|1G7UyHFQaa	With the sidekick there are extra fees for the use of internet. Right now you may have a basic wireless plan and text messages. However, you can upgrade to the sidekick at any time. You can upgrade through the t mobile website or you can use a third party website who at times have better pricing than T- Mobile.  A third party website that I have used in the past was wirefly.com. I recently bought a blackberry 8900 which I ordered directly from T- Mobile<br>  **A mail in rebate is like getting money back for the purchase of the phone. For example the phone may cost $299.99 with a $100.00 mail in rebate. You will pay the $299.99 up front and after they received the rebate ( which comes in the same box as the phone), you will receive a $100.00 check in the mail|`|nQtcCn0saa	A mail-in rebate is when you mail something that comes with the phone back to the manufacturer and they send you back a specific amount of money, and there is a such thing as sidekick fees. Your mom would have to get the sidekick plan which includes unlimited data(internet) and texts. There are two types of plans, one costs $29.95 a month and includes unlimited data and 250 texts, and the other is $39.95 a month and includes unlimited data and unlimited texts.

j5Apt8hWaa	There is not much you cannot do with the on-board flash that you can do with an external flash except with more power.  On-board flash units are only good when used as a flash-fill tool.<br>  <br>  Experimenting with light, would require you to be able to move the lighting around the subject to create back lighting, side lighting, key and fill lighting and multi-lamp lighting.  To be able to see what the light is doing to the subject BEFORE you take a shot, you need to use some continuous lighting lamps.  You can start by using some inexpensive work lamps sold in home supply stores like Home Depot.  You can get a couple of 500 watt lamps for under $40, then with your camera on a tripod, you can shoot products, adjusting the light directions and intensity as you learn how to control the lighting.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	While I agree with Fhotoace on the most part if you are looking for a flash that will be more powerful that you can use when not in a studio situation the 430EXII should be fine. It will allow you to bounce and swivel the flash to adjust the way the lighting looks. You could get the 580EXII but you probably wont need it.|`|AA10912074	The Canon 430EX will cover most of what the average photographer would need.  A few differences with the 580EX it has a little more power and if you use Canon's wireless system (which isn't that great) the 580EX can be a master.  You also get a sync port on the 580.  For the extra money for these few things, the 430 is your best value.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	At $65, it's an ultra cheap and crappy camera that has a fixed lens, which means it has NO optical zoom whatsoever...and only has 4x digital zoom (which you should never use). It also uses AAA batteries!<br>  <br>  It would be ok for a kid...but if I were you, I would aim just a bit higher. Even Canon's ultra budget A470 (less than $100) is far superior to this piece of junk.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	you are better off sticking with a major brand.<br>  I don't think you will be happy with yours.|`|ee9AoGPMaa	I don't know usually a cheaper brand name has more problems then a major brand name. Its really up to you if you want to keep repairing the cheap camera again and again. I had experience with cheap brand name cameras and I kept repairing it. So I went out and bought a Sony one and I never had a problem with it at all. ;)

j5Apt8hWaa	Why do you think you need to clean it.  I have a D200 that has never needed cleaning (I only change lenses when I am in protected areas so no dust can get into the area behind the lens)<br>  <br>  If your need to clean it because you do see some dust in your image files, then in a dust free area, take off the lens, hold the camera face down and gently use a Rubber Air Bulb  to blow some air across the sensor while you are holding the shutter open.  You may have to do this a few times, but no matter what, do NOT touch the sensor.  Expensive repairs may be the next step you take

aaMo4KIsaa	32 inch, full HD(1080p) is the smallest in the line, and a good choice IMO.
wrI7VwmLaa	It really depends on what type of game you want to play.  Killzone 2 is more of an in-your-face first person shooter, while Fallout 3 is a first person shooter meets RPG.  With Killzone 2, you just join the fight and duke it out.  Straight paths and corridors, simple mechanics, Killzone 2 is your basic 1st person shooter.  Fallout 3, on the other hand, is more along the lines of Elder Scrolls:  Oblivion.  It has a heavy RPG feel, and while it is 1st/3rd person, you spend a lot of shooting in the VATs auto-targeting system, instead focusing on equipment and customization.<br>  Personally, I would go Fallout 3.  Being a free-roaming game, you can advance the story whenever you want, with the option to either do side quests or dick around.  Killzone 2 doesn't offer that.  If you feel better playing Gears of War or Halo instead of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion or Mass Effect, then go Killzone 2.  Otherwise, stick with Fallout 3, which I think has a better story, gameplay, and more bang for your buck.|`|pl2SocVKaa	i think killzone 2 is the better game it supports online which fallout 3 doesn't and its online includes squads and clans to play in so you can get noticed and stuff while fallout 3 is very good it doesn't reach or get close to what killzone 2 does|`|VcNHahtgaa	Killzone no contest.<br>  <br>  Fallout 3 is for 360 until the developers pays attention on updating the PS3 version.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	WOW what a question. I got both, I have had fallout for about a month and just got killzone twoday. It all comes down to what you like more FPS or RPG. if you like the first person shooters better go with killzone if you like RPG then go Fallout. Fallout is a great game. Lots of stuff to do in the Capital Wasteland and I think it has 8 endings with like 5 variations on each ending. Also there is a lot to find and explore. Cons are I here and experience about lots of freezes stalls, things like that. ALso load times, i know there not long but they are there. With killzone I can just turn it on and shoot some people. Were fallout there is some work before the shooting. they are both great games and I think you should get both, but if I had to choose I would say killzone just because the shine has worn off fallout 3 for me at least.|`|m4VVsdmWaa	I personally think Killzone 2 might last longer in replayability because it has multiplayer (That's very addicting might I add) and wonderful gameplay elements whereas Fallout 3 is an enormous world that holds alot of moral choices and quests and things to explore though it's only single player it will still last at least a good 50 hours of play.|`|LkOW2I6Jaa	no contest killzone 2 bro!!|`|hTbvfUOeaa	kz2 is alright.but fallout sucks.|`|PR42HDjraa	oh man FallOut 3 was phenomenal! It has 72 side quests. It'll take a looong time for u to get bored. the story line is great, graphics are great and characters are great. The world is HUGE! You can go to so many different places. You also can have mixed outcomes and you can change your future. Its the best, buy it!|`|Cmt9Dbb0aa	Fallout 3|`|JepeaPHsaa	That depends on whether you prefer shooters or rpgs.

ZW1eal62aa	I think that's the best your find for that phone. You could try amazon or cregslist but that's risky and you don't know what your getting and so on and so on if it's in the condition they say it's in all that stuff you get when you buy for the store. trust me I've try everything to get phones cheaper than they sale it for but never I also find it's best to just get from verizon.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	craigslist maybe?|`|1jG7DKDsaa	Craigslist, Ebay, Or online at Verizon they also sometimes have good deals.

The movies won't play anymore anyways, so there is no point of keeping them.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	delete the videos from itunes then resync your ipod|`|qXFACB58aa	Assuming you don't have any video podcasts or or videos of your own... uncheck them or go to your ipod settings and disable videos being synced.
