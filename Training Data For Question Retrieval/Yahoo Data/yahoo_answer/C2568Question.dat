20090223155219AAHV85W	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I think my car is leaking oil?	Well i just bought a 99 Sebring, and it appeared to be leak free the first couple of days. Just this after noon i noticed some black spots under the car, i assume its an oil leak. What i dont know is how bad this is for the car or how much it could cost to repair.      Also a few problems that i knew prior to purchase where that it is going to need new brakes soon. (You can hear that high pitch squeal sound when slowing) I would like to knowhow much that will cost me labor included.      And secondly when i start it every now and then (not to often) it makes a squealing sound where the engine is. I think it might be a belt that needs replacing but am also unsure.         Any help you can offer is appreciated from price of repairs or opinions.      Thanks so much,         -Kyle

20090223164552AAIpyPc	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Stick shift questions. Please help. First time stick shift driver...?	I got me a 1999 Chevy Cavalier recently. It's a stick and has 5 gears and the reverse. Well, I'm doing ok so far, only stalled twice trying to reverse. Today though I noticed that when I go to put the car in reverse (which is bottom right), it grinds at me. I have the clutch pushed to the floor, but it still grinds. Could it have already been in reverse and me pulling on it more is making it grind or what could be the problem? And also, when I go to shift to 3rd gear it's so hard to get it in gear. And yes, I have the clutch in at all times. According to stick manuals for cavaliers it says the 3rd gear you have to push right, then up and there's 3rd gear, but recently it's been hard to get it into gear. What can I do about it? I don't want to break the gears. I love the car...

20090223162713AArqR89	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Did my car battery needed to be replaced?	Woke up this morning to go to the gym only to find out that my car was not starting.  I popped the hood and noticed that there was a lot of acid build up.  Cleaned it with baking soda and tried jumping the car with those self-jumper kits.  No luck.  Removed the battery and took it to Advanced Auto and they checked it with those battery checker.  The machine said the battery needs to be replaced.  So I bought a new one and replaced it.  Unfortunately, car still doesn't start.  Now I have to wonder if it was the battery in the first place.  I remember the lights, car alarm, radio and everything worked with the old battery.  Anyway, do I now return the battery and get my money back?        If it's not the battery, what else could it be?  Car almost sounds like it's going to start when I crank it, but doesn't quite catch.  Help!

20070517120442AAuqadg	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Can I sue this guy who I was in a car accident with, as well as my insurance company?	I was in a car accident with a man who tried to turn from the center lane to get into a shopping plaza.  His insurance denied the claim and felt that I was 70% at fault of the accident even though I wasn't doing anything else but driving straight (no turning, etc. on my part).  The police report states that this guy was at fault and they still denied my claim.  My insurance company took a month to respond to the claim of the accident. I did the right thing by letting them know that I was in an accident.  A month later they are not giving me the total amount for the repairs because the can't justify it.  The didn't come and look at the car until after the car had been fixed.  Not only that but I took pictures of the car and I had to furnish the pictures for them to make an estimate.  I am extremely frustrated I paid $400 for a car rental for a week and had to bring the rental car back because I couldn't afford it.  I have been driving my dad's car for the last 2 weeks.

It acts like it's misfiring or isn't getting gas, but it only does it with the air conditioning running. It isn't the initial kick when the compressor engages, either. It does this with the air conditioning on whether the compressor is engaged or not. Spark plugs and wires are new, no check engine light, no codes are stored.

20081029044954AAlvBIH	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How to tell what weight oil was really used?	In troublishooting some other things, I've discovered that one of the service "reciepts" from one oil change ago says they (the dealer) used 10w30 instead of 5w20.  The most recent says they used the right oil.      This was at the dealer, they claim that no they really used the right thing and just entered it wrong...is there any way to what's in it?      I do notice it takes about 7 seconds for the oil-pressure light to go out after the engine is running and you can hear what sounds like a can of marbles until the pressure comes up...it's a '06 Hyundai Sonata if that helps.

20081111085635AAQNsC9	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Is it smart to lease a car?	I'm 16 and I have my license but not a car.      I saw in the newspaper a lease offer for a 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer DE   with monthly payments that I could easily pay for.   The lease is very short, only 24 months, which is better for me anyway.      Of course, my parents would sign the lease,   and I would just pay them.      But what I want to know,   is that is it smart for me to lease a new car?      because a brand new Mitsubishi would be really cool   but I'm not sure if it is smart for me to spend money towards leasing.      Should I just save up and buy an old used car in cash for like $3-4k   or should I lease this new car?      btw my parents would pay for insurance   I would only pay the monthly payments for lease.

In 30 years will we see 300zx's, rx-7, and supra's on the Barret Jackson stage? I was just looking at production numbers for theses cars and on certain models not very many were made. I actually own a 94 convertable 300zx and i know that they only produced them for 3 years and made less the 4000 of them. I see muscle cars bringing crazy money and more of them were made than my car. Is there any possibility that a restored 300zx convertable could one day bring 40-60 thousand dollars? Also any input regarding the rx-7 and supra would be great. Because to me the 300zx, rx-7, and supra were the dominating sports cars of the early 90's, or at least the turbo models were.

I just switched to a Palm Treo 650 (on Verizon) and would like to connect it to my car through Bluetooth. I know I have bluetooth, as I was able to pair my previous phone with it. I tried earlier tonight, the pairing seemed successful (phone discovered car, asked for passkey), but when I tried to place a call from the phone with the car on, my phone kept turning off. The radio would stop when I did this though, then turn back on when the phone turned off. I read online that someone else was able to get their Treo 650 to pair w/their 325i. Is there something I'm missing?? I had the car turned on to the first key stop position when I was doing the pairing, then the 2nd key stop position when I was trying to place the call. Anything I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance :-)

Luckily I was able to pull over and have a friend give me another jump.    But the car would only go about 3-5 miles before it would die again. So every time it would die they would jump me again untill I got home.       Could it be the alternator? For about a month now it seems like the battery hasn't been at full power (dim lights,takes a minute to get started,etc)     Could this be the reason? Also my brake lights have stopped working, I'm not sure if it is related to this or not, and the battery is basically brand new I bought it in June.

20081011044330AA4pkW5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Difference between auto and manual..?	first off I ain't talking about trannies. I have been looking around for a motor for my EX and everyone asks is it auto or manual....   So I was wondering is there a difference between them? I'm a noobie to the Honda mototr scene so I just had to ask... can you not just change the flexplate/flywheel?? or are there other balancing issues that doing this would disturb..?   Just wondering because it seems that every motor I find is for a manual and of coarse I need an auto..   Thanks for the info

20081012212444AAOsd2U	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;BMW	2008 BMW 335 Options?	I own a 2008 BMW 335 and I am now rethinking a couple features that I didn't purchase when I bought the car.  One of them is the iPod interface and the other is heated seats.  Are either of these to easy to have installed into the car?  I was silly to not have them installed originally, but would like to get them installed now (if possible).  I know both cost $500 as add-on features to the cars - would they be the same price to get them installed afterwards?
20081012223442AAr4YEP	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Should I buy an Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 8 or a Subaru WRX STi (same year)?	Which one? It's coming down to whatever is available for the best price. Since basically they are in the same exact class. I know a fair amount of In-line engines... I don't know anything about that boxer on the Subaru. But I've heard that Subaru's are slightly more dependable.      I'm not into heavily modifying cars, I want more of a durability factor in my engine. Later in life, I want to gut out the interior and make it into an amateur rally car and go on off-road courses as a hobby. Then I'll mess around with heavy engine modifications.      But where to start? Which car?      p.s. Please don't flame each other, just want some opinions and maybe some experience from owners. Thanks!

It's a good car, and it's pretty reliable with very low mileage. I plan on driving it for another 2-5 years. Since my car's not worth that much and won't last but a few more years do you think a Maaco paint job would be alright for this short time? I don't want a paint job worth more than the car, but if Maaco is really as cheap as some people say would the paint even last me a year or two?

I have a 2007 chevy impala automatic transmission.      obviously i know what the purpose of the first four gear options are:   P, R, N, D.      but then after D   there is 3,2,1.      What is the purpose of these three options?   can they be used for engine braking?   like suppose i was slowing down   and i was in D   if i put it into 3 while the car is still moving,   will the auto transmission downshift?   will it hurt the transmission to do so?      also,   suppose i'm at a stoplight   and i feel like having a little fun   and so i put into 1   and then accelerate pretty fast,   if i put it into 2 by the time the revs get somewhat high   will it damage the transmission   or will it just shift up w/out any damage?   if not then it would be cool   because that would   give somewhat of a manual transmission feel   to a boring old automatic
